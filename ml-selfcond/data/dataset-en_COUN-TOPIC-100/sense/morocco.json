            "Nearshoring: The driving momentum behind Moroccan EV manufacturingOn July 21, 2022, Moroccan Minister of Industry Ryad Mezzour informed the press that the kingdom was close to signing a deal with EV battery manufacturers to establish a massive local production facility.",
            "While Mezzour has been vague about the number of lines and total capacity of the proposed Moroccan facility, Tesla’s successful $2 billion gigafactory in Shanghai, China, was originally intended to produce 500,000 EV batteries per year.",
            "It is possible that the output of Morocco’s gigafactory will be of a comparable order of magnitude.",
            "The production of EV batteries on such a scale would be appropriate for Morocco’s impressive automotive manufacturing ecosystem, which already has the capacity to produce over 700,000 vehicles per year.",
            "Now Rabat is aiming to increase Morocco’s output to 1 million vehicles per year by 2025, with many of those being EVs.",
            "Already in November 2021, Morocco’s public finance bill for 2022 proposed a reduction of the import duty on lithium-ion cells from 40% to 17.5% to promote the local assembly of Li-ion batteries using cells imported from East Asia.",
            "The key to Morocco’s rise as a green mobility manufacturing giant will be expanding its automotive ecosystem to include local manufacture of Li-ion batteries, which represent 30% to 40% of the cost of the average EV.",
            "Nearshoring, combined with Rabat’s smart industrial planning and careful cultivation of foreign partnerships, is the engine of the self-reinforcing momentum propelling the advancement of Morocco’s automotive manufacturing sector.",
            "In order to maintain a competitive advantage in operating expenditures, international firms began to locate manufacturing facilities in Morocco.",
            "Rabat fueled the momentum for nearshoring in Morocco through its 2014-2020 Industrial Acceleration Plan and its concurrent development of high-speed, high-volume capacity transportation that saw the construction of Tanger Med Port, the Mediterranean’s largest, as well as the al-Boraq rail line (Casablanca–Tangier), Africa’s first high-speed rail system.",
            "Morocco’s linked state-of-the-art port and rail prompted Groupe Renault to establish a second Moroccan manufacturing plant and Groupe PSA (now part of the Stellantis conglomerate) to open a Peugeot manufacturing plant in Kénitra, north of Rabat.",
            "As a result of the nearshoring momentum, Europe’s two best-selling car models — the Peugeot 208 and Renault’s Dacia Sandero — are made in Morocco.",
            "The production of EV batteries in Morocco, with at least some of the major battery metals sourced locally, could represent a sufficient cost advantage to convince Renault to build the Dacia Spring or successor EV models at the company’s Moroccan plants.",
            "Prioritizing supply chain security for its European end-markets over just-in-time inventories supplied by East Asia, Renault would likely start EV production in Morocco once Li-ion battery manufacturing gets under way.",

            "As Industry Minister Mezzour explained, “Morocco has no choice, because 90% of our automotive exports go to Europe and Europe has decided to switch to all-electric by 2035.”",
            "Cobalt mined from Morocco’s Bou Azzer mine, in OuarzazateProvince.",
            "The proximity of Morocco’s cobalt reserves to European EV manufacturing centers, which face high demand pressure for this critical metal and the ability to ensure that it is extracted through more palatable mining practices, has thus turned their attention to North Africa.",
            "This is despite the fact that Moroccan cobalt reserves are relatively small: only the world’s 11th largest.",
            "In 2020, the kingdom’s cobalt exports totaled $84 million, ranking Morocco the 13th-biggest exporter.",
            "Nonetheless, in July 2020, German automaker BMW signed a $113 million contract with Moroccan mining company Managem to supply 20% of the cobalt required to manufacture BMW’s next-generation electric drive trains.",
            "As the purchasing director for Renault explained, the deal with Morocco ensures “a supply closer to our ecosystem of manufacturing electric batteries in Europe.”",
            "Considering that Managem is supposed to start supplying cobalt to Renault in 2025, the company may also be eyeing local battery production in Morocco.",
            "The reduction in the carbon footprint of Morocco’s cobalt supply will also be achieved through the recycling of end-of-life batteries.",
            "If extracted in sufficient quantities, Morocco could locally source all of the major metals used in NMC Li-ion batteries.",
            "And Morocco may have its own domestic supply of lithium as well.",

            "The kingdom’s massive phosphate mining and fertilizer manufacturing sector, run by the state-owned OCP Group (formerly Office Chérifien des Phosphates), has transformed Morocco into a gatekeeper of the world’s food supply.",
            "By using phosphate and iron — Morocco is also a net exporter of iron ore — to make LFP batteries, instead of nickel, manganese, and cobalt for its NMC counterpart, Morocco could enjoy a cost advantage of upward of 70% per kilogram.",
            "In speaking to the Moroccan press, Industry Minister Mezzour indicated that Morocco was looking at producing stationary batteries for the storage of renewable energy as well as for EV batteries.",
            "These stationary Li-ion batteries bear a clear resemblance to Tesla’s “megapack” line of utility-scale energy storage units that the company launched in 2019, suggesting that Tesla may be one of the international firms in negotiations with Morocco for the gigafactory.",
            "Morocco will need to expand its phosphate and phosphoric acid production to make LFP EV batteries.",
            "For Morocco, the diversification of uses and markets for its phosphate output is highly desirable.",
            "Morocco’s Western partners, especially those whose companies are involved in the kingdom’s LFP battery production, should encourage and support Morocco to develop spare capacity in its phosphate sector.",
            "Analogous to the role Saudi Arabia’s Aramco plays in stabilizing oil markets, Morocco’s OCP should have the ability to bring spare phosphate production capacity online and take it offline as needed.",
            "Morocco possesses considerable solar and wind resources.",
            "Phosphate production as well as other parts of Morocco’s EV manufacturing chain should become increasingly powered by renewable energy to ensure that its green mobility vehicles are produced in a sustainable and climate smart manner.",
            "Reliant on gas and coal imports, Morocco’s Western partners should work with Rabat to move the country’s EV manufacturing to be powered by locally available solar and wind resources to promote greater supply chain resilience as well as ensuring that its manufacture of green mobility vehicles is also green.",
