            "We confirm that Cuba is home to the world’s largest European honeybee population that has naturally become Varroa-resistant, with an estimated 220,000 colonies being maintained without any form of chemical treatment for over two decades19 although some drone-trapping occurred during the early years of the transition period This is despite the presence of the K-haplotype of the mite20 and the widespread occurrence of DWV19 throughout Cuba.",
            "Hence, the Cuban honeybee population is the first major case of Varroa-resistant European bees occupying an entire country of a large size (109,884 km2).",
            "It has long been established that sub-Sharan African and Africanised honeybees are Varroa-resistant and both populations cover much larger areas than Cuba, but these honeybee races are not capable of thriving in temperate regions or are rejected by beekeepers in Northern hemispheres.",
            "However, previous studies on African/Africanised and European honeybees4,5,6,9 all appear to have evolved with the same resistance mechanism7 and Cuban honeybees follow this pattern showing high recapping behaviour, high mite removal behaviour and low mite reproduction (Figs. 1, 4, Table 1).",
            "The ability of Cuban honeybees to detect infested cells causes not only high recapping levels but also high removal rates of artificially mite-infested cells.",
            "The reproductive ability of Varroa to produce viable i.e., mated, female offspring (r) in infested worker cells in resistant colonies in South Africa4 (r = 0.9), Brazil4 (r = 0.8), Mexico18 (r = 0.73), Europe3 (r = 0.84) is similar to the 0.87 found in Cuba (this study).",

            "Therefore, we predict that the worker infestation rate in Cuba will continue to fall over the next 20 years, especially if high mite-removal rates persist.",

            "Although Cuban beekeepers have been aware of their mite-resistant honeybees for 15 to 20 years’, Cuba’s situation has only recently come to light16,18.",
            "The main reason for Varroa-resistance in Cuba is due to the centralised decision to allow natural resistance to evolve, as also was done successfully in South Africa3, rather than becoming locked into using miticides, as has happened throughout the Northern hemisphere.",
            "The CIAPI and Veterinarian Services central decision to ‘not treat’ was greatly assisted by all Cuban beekeepers being professional, registered and embedded within a strong locally based beekeeping community where colony movement and exchange of queens is within each province.",
            "There is also a large feral population and due to Cuba’s sub-tropical climate, queens are replaced annually in managed colonies because of almost continuous egg-laying, similar to honeybees in Hawaii.",
