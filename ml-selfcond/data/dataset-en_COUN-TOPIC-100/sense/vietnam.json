            "The fact that Samsung – one of the largest players in the global electronic industry, chose Vietnam and the United States for starting the production of semiconductors, rather than Japan, Europe, or any other country speaks volumes for Vietnam’s potential as an emerging manufacturing hub and also the country’s ambition to continue growing in the forseeable future.",

            "DisadvantagesFilippo also mentioned key challenges that Vietnam may have to face in developing the semiconductor industry.",
            "What is most noteworthy is that packaging and testing, the sector that Vietnam is most involved in, is a low-margin part of the semiconductor industry compared to the design and manufacturing of semiconductors.",
            "In fact, the main issue that might prevent Vietnam to step up another ladder in the value chain lies in the high requirements for manufacturing infrastructure as well as the strong expertise of labor.",
            "Filippo believes that Vietnam has all it takes to tap into manufacturing, however, this is likely to take some time and would also depend on the political system to direct and support entrepreneurs, as well as on the global macroeconomic variables that might influence and reshape global supply.",
