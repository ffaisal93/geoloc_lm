    "How innovative finance is helping to protect Indonesia’s forests": "Indonesia’s Bukit Tigapuluh National Park sits at the centre of the island of Sumatra and is one of the world’s great ecological hotspots, home to plants and animals not found anywhere else.\n\nIts residents include a laundry list of Indonesia’s most iconic wildlife, including the Sumatran elephant, tiger and orangutan.\n\nBut just outside the park’s boundaries are sprawling oil palm and rubber plantations, which chew up the area’s dense jungle and threaten animal habitats.\n\nA project spearheaded by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and several partners, however, is giving animals more breathing room.\n\nThe Tropical Landscapes Finance Facility has channeled US$95 million in financing to Indonesia rubber producers and helped them plant dense fields of trees on already marginal land, sparing virgin forests. In the face of rising demand for Indonesia’s natural resources, experts say this innovative financial model is key to slowing deforestation.",
    "Indonesia at UN: ASEAN refuses to be a pawn in ‘a new Cold War’": "Jakarta’s top diplomat also says “principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity are non-negotiable.”\n\nIndonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi addresses the 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly at U.N. Headquarters in New York, Sept. 26, 2022.\n\nRegional bloc ASEAN will “refuse to be a pawn in a new Cold War,” Indonesia’s top diplomat said at the U.N. on Monday, as she vowed that Jakarta would not let geopolitics block global economic recovery under its G20 presidency.\n\nDuring her speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi spoke twice about how “the fundamental principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity are non-negotiable” but did not mention Russia’s war in Ukraine or territorial tensions in the South China Sea.\n\nAs she stood in for Indonesian President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo, who was conspicuously absent from the most visible podium on the international diplomatic stage, Retno also criticized many post-war “mini-lateral groupings,” saying they had “become part of a proxy war between major powers.”\n\n“This is not what regional architecture should be. It must serve as the building block for peace and stability rather than undermining them,” she said.\n\nOne such regional grouping, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), was formed to advance peace in the region, she said.\n\n“ASEAN was built exactly for this purpose. We refuse to be a pawn in a new Cold War,” Retno said.\n\n“Instead, we actively promote the paradigm of collaboration with all countries. This paradigm will also guide Indonesia’s Chairmanship in ASEAN next year.”\n\nIndonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest and most populous country, is a founding member of the regional bloc and Jakarta serves as the headquarters of the ASEAN Secretariat. It will take over as ASEAN chair from Cambodia next year, during a tumultuous time for the grouping, when it is dealing with a post-coup crisis in member-state Myanmar.\n\nASEAN has been roundly criticized for its inaction in Myanmar and for the failure of a five-point consensus that the Burmese military agreed to at an emergency meeting last year. Washington, too, has been pushing ASEAN to take stronger steps against the Burmese junta led by Sr. Gen. Min Aung Hlaing.\n\nThe 10-member regional bloc famously operates by consensus. And critics have said that some of the member-states’ close ties with China have prevented stronger action by ASEAN against the Myanmar military.\n\nHowever, Retno said, Indonesia was very concerned about the Myanmar military’s inaction on the five-point roadmap to return the country to democracy, a roadmap that fellow member-state Malaysia has said should be scrapped in favor of a new approach.\n\nSimilarly, ASEAN has not condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine, analysts say, because several countries, including Indonesia, rely on Moscow for their weapons needs.\n\nIndonesia, too, did not directly condemn Russia for the invasion, although it did vote for a U.N. General Assembly resolution in March that “deplored” Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.\n\n‘World is pinning their hope on G20’\n\nStill, Jakarta is caught betwixt and between, because as G20 president this year it has to balance the ire of the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union, on the one hand, and Russia’s defense of its actions and Beijing’s support of Moscow, on the other.\n\nIn March, U.S. President Joe Biden, who is expected to attend the G20 summit in Bali in November, urged President Jokowi to invite Ukraine as a guest if Russia was not expelled from the group. Jokowi did invite Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but it is not yet certain if Russian President Putin will attend the summit.\n\nIn her speech on Monday, Retno said there was no option but for the G20 summit to produce some solutions for the struggling post-pandemic world.\n\n“The whole world is pinning their hope on G20 to be a catalyst of global economic recovery, especially for developing countries,” Retno said.\n\n“G20 must not fail. We cannot let global recovery fall at the mercy of geopolitics,” she told the General Assembly.\n\nUkraine and Russia provide 30 percent of the world’s wheat and barley, a fifth of its maize and more than half of its sunflower oil. The two countries are also major producers and suppliers of fertilizers. In addition, Russia is the world’s largest natural gas exporter and second largest oil exporter.\n\nFor almost six months after Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, it blocked all of the latter’s Black Sea ports and cut off access to almost all of that country’s exports, especially of grain, several news services have reported. Those moves sparked fears of a global food crisis.\n\nRussia has since lifted the blockade under a U.N.-backed deal in July, the Black Sea Grain Initiative, but the spillover effect of the months-long halt of grain exports has led to food inflation in many parts of the world. The rise in food prices comes on top of sky-high fuel prices, amid Western sanctions on Russian oil.\n\n“We must act urgently to address food and energy crises and prevent a fertilizer crisis from happening. Otherwise, billions more people would be at risk, particularly in developing countries,” Retno said.\n\nIn such a situation, Retno said, “peaceful solution is the only option to settle any conflicts.”\n\n“My president conveyed these messages of peace in his visits to Kyiv and Moscow last June,” the Indonesian foreign minister said, referring to Jokowi’s so-called peace mission to Ukraine and Russia.\n\n“A habit of dialogue and cooperation would nurture strategic trust,” Retno said.\n\n“These are the rules of the game that we must maintain if we truly want peace.”\n\nBenarNews is an RFA-affiliated news service.",

    "WTD 2022, Strategic Momentum for Indonesia to Realize Sustainable Tourism Agenda": "Bali, September 25th 2022 –\n\nFor the first time in history, Indonesia has the honor to hosting the 42nd World Tourism Day 2022 celebration on 27 September 2022 in Bali, which will be a crucial and strategic momentum for Indonesia to realize its development agenda as well as quality and sustainable tourism.\n\nMinister of Tourism and Creative Economy/Head of Tourism and Creative Economy, Sandiaga Salahuddin Uno, Sunday (25/9/2022), stated that this year’s World Tourism Day is celebrated as a transition to tourism which will be recognized as an important pillar for the development and progress of tourism after the pandemic.\n\nTherefore, the theme for WTD 2022 is “Rethinking Tourism”. In which, stakeholders in the tourism sector unite their vision and mission through creative ideas oriented towards ‘people’ and ‘planet’ to strengthen resilience. So that the tourism sector will not be vulnerable to disasters.\n\nSince the pandemic hit the world, all stakeholders have realized that strengthening the basic foundation of tourism that puts forward ‘people’ (preparing a more resilient, superior and competitive society) and ‘planet’ (maintaining environmental sustainability and natural wealth) are an absolute thing that must be done by every tourism individual.\n\n“So that the value of tourism itself will be even greater because it has a good impact not only on improving community’s welfare but also on the sustainability of our earth. For this reason, the celebration of World Tourism Day 2022 is a very strategic momentum for Indonesia to realize the agenda and ideals of a more sustainable future tourism,” according to Minister Sandiaga.\n\nThe celebration of WTD this time will feature a multi-stakeholder discussion panel with the theme “Rethinking Tourism as a Key Element on Recovery” and also a discussion with the theme “The Tourism We Want” which will be led by representatives from the tourism sector in Bali.\n\nIt is projected that a total of 200 to 300 representatives of UNWTO member countries, G20 Tourism Ministers, guest countries, international organizations, national and international tourism stakeholders will be present to strengthen the celebrations and key messages of World Tourism Day.\n\n“Of course, the celebration of this World Tourism Day belongs to all of us, the Indonesian people as part of the world community. And the success of World Tourism Day 2022 will be the success of all of us and all Indonesian tourism people,” he added.\n\nActing Deputy for Resources and Institutions of the MOTCE, Frans Teguh, added that through this activity, it is expected that tourism can be part of building the nation in a better direction.\n\n“This means that tourism belongs to us all and we want to encourage and ensure to build the nation together through tourism,” Frans said.",
    "Can Jakarta Resist Fuel Price Pressures?": "Can Jakarta fuel price pressures and buck global trend of rising prices? – Photo: Shutterstock; 1000 words\n\nIndonesia reacted to pressure from high oil prices by raising subsidised fuel prices by around 33% on 3 September.\n\nThe Indonesian government tripled energy subsidies, widening the state budget deficit.\n\nHigher subsidised fuel prices could boost the inflation rate in the coming months and force the country’s central bank, Bank Indonesia, to hike interest rates.\n\nHere we look at Indonesia’s inflation history and the latest economic news affecting the Indonesia inflation rate forecast in 2022 and beyond.\n\nWhat is inflation and how is it measured in Indonesia?\n\nInflation is the rise in prices of goods and services. It reflects a decline in money’s purchasing power. When prices rise, consumers have less money to spend, which has a significant impact on the cost of living, causing economic growth to slow.\n\nIn Indonesia, the country’s national statistics office, the Statistics Indonesia (BPS), calculates the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation in accordance with seven categories:\n\nFoodstuffs\n\nProcessed food, beverages and tobacco\n\nHousing\n\nClothing\n\nHealth\n\nEducation and sport\n\nTransportation and communication\n\nIt measures the change in living costs in 90 cities in Indonesia, including 34 provincial capital cities. Supply factors that influence inflation include global oil price movements, failed harvests and natural disasters such as floods.\n\nThe Indonesian government and Bank Indonesia jointly set an inflation target. Based on a 2021 Finance Minister regulation, the inflation targets for 2022, 2023 and 2024 were at 3.0%, 3.0% and 2.5%, respectively, within plus or minus 1%.\n\nIndonesia allocates energy subsidies covering gasoline, electricity and household liquefied natural gas to protect people in low-income groups. Fuel and LPG subsidies account for more than 50% of total energy subsidies.\n\nAs of July 2022, the energy subsidy accounted for roughly 6.7% of total government spending at IDR 3,106trn, according to the Finance Ministry data.\n\nEnergy subsidies are politically sensitive. The withdrawal of a large fuel subsidy in May 1998 sparked nationwide protests and riots, prompting President Suharto to resign.\n\nIndonesia inflation rate: Historical context\n\nThe inflation rate reached an all-time high of 82.40% in September 1998, during the Asian financial crisis. The record low Indonesian inflation, or deflation rate, was -1.17% in March 2020. The rate averaged 8.88% from 1997 to 2022.\n\nIndonesia was hit hard by the Asian financial crisis, which began with Thailand's currency crash in July 1997. The rupiah depreciated 70% between July 1997 and January 1998 and the country’s stock exchange index fell 50%, an International Monetary Fund (IMF) report showed.\n\nBetween 2019 to mid-2022, Indonesia enjoyed a benign inflation rate period. Even in 2021, when other developed nations started to see rising inflation amid rebounding global energy prices and demand post-Covid-19, inflation in Indonesia remained below the government’s target. It averaged at 2.72% in 2019, 1.68% in 2020 and 1.87% in 2021. The inflation target was 3.5% for 2019 and 3% for 2020-2021.\n\nWith a low inflation rate, the Indonesian central bank gradually cut its BI 7-day (Reverse) Repo Rate to 3.5% in February 2021, from 6% in June 2019. The bank maintained its policy rate at 3.50% until July 2022.\n\nThe Inflation rate in Indonesia had only started to accelerate, exceeding the government’s inflation target in April 2022. Annual CPI rose to 3.47% in April, compared to 2.64% in March, according to data from BPS.\n\nFood, beverages and tobacco recorded the biggest jump at 1.76%, in line with a surge in global commodity prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Indonesia relies on imports for some staples, including wheat and sugar.\n\nInflation continued to climb, peaking at an eight-year high of 4.94% in July. Food, beverages and tobacco remained the main driver with a 1.19% increase, followed by transportation at 1.13%. In August, however, the annual inflation rate eased slightly to 4.69%.\n\nFood and administered price goods drive inflation\n\nInflation from administered prices, such as airplane tickets, household fuel and cigarettes, and volatile food groups were the main drivers for the peak reading in July. Nicholas Mapa, ING Group’s senior economist, wrote on 3 August:\n\n“Food, restaurants, utilities and transport items are the main contributors to headline inflation, accounting for 81% of overall price gains. Also adding to price pressures this year was the implementation of an excise tax on tobacco products which has pushed up tobacco prices by 7%.”\n\nIndonesia’s Finance Ministry increased the excise tax for cigarettes, cigars and other tobacco products by an average 12% from 1 January 2022.\n\nNatural Gas 7.08 Price +0.780% 1D Chg, % Trade now Swap Short: Swap Long: Long position overnight fee -0.0992% Short position overnight fee 0.0688% Overnight fee time 21:00 (UTC) Spread 0.005 Trade now US100 11,252.80 Price -0.680% 1D Chg, % Trade now Swap Short: Swap Long: Long position overnight fee -0.0138% Short position overnight fee 0.0041% Overnight fee time 21:00 (UTC) Spread 1.5 Trade now BTC/USD 19,171.65 Price +1.230% 1D Chg, % Trade now Swap Short: Swap Long: Long position overnight fee -0.0500% Short position overnight fee 0.0140% Overnight fee time 21:00 (UTC) Spread 66.00 Trade now XRP/USD 0.48 Price -5.540% 1D Chg, % Trade now Swap Short: Swap Long: Long position overnight fee -0.0500% Short position overnight fee 0.0140% Overnight fee time 21:00 (UTC) Spread 0.00600 Trade now\n\nThe country’s reliance on oil imports makes domestic fuel prices vulnerable to the volatility of global oil prices, which hit a record in March, and the US dollar to Indonesian rupiah exchange rate (USD/IDR), which also affects inflation. A stronger dollar and elevated oil prices boost fuel prices in rupiah.\n\nOn 10 July, Indonesia’s state-energy company, Pertamina, increased the price of household liquified petroleum gas (LPG) for a 12-kg canister to IDR 213,000-270,000 ($14-$17.86), from IDR 187,000-IDR 243,000 ($12.37-$16.08).\n\nVolatile foods inflation stood at 11.47% year-over-year in July, up from 10.07% in June as heavy rains disrupted supplies of staples such as cooking oil, chillies, eggs and fresh fish, according to Bank Indonesia.\n\nIndonesia relies on imports for some of its food staples, such as wheat, soybean and sugar. Prices for these agricultural commodities have risen this year, partly due to the war in Ukraine.\n\nBank Indonesia responded to rising inflation in July by lifting its policy rate by 25bps to 3.75% in its August meeting – its first rate hike since February 2021.\n\nSubsidised fuel prices\n\nThe Indonesian government’s decision to increase the price of subsidised fuel could keep inflation high in the coming months.\n\nOn 3 September 2022, President Joko Widodo raised the price of subsidised gasoline Pertalite to IDR 10,000 a litre, from IDR 7,500, and the price of subsidised diesel to IDR 6,800 a litre, from IDR 5,150.\n\nThe government resorted to hiking fuel costs as the 2022 subsidy tripled to IDR 502trn ($33.17bn), from IDR 152.5trn ($10.07bn), on rising crude prices.\n\nFollowing the fuel price rise, Bank Indonesia opted for a 50 basis points (bps) rate hike, bringing the policy rate to 4.25% in September. The move aims to return core inflation to its target range of 3% in the later half of 2023 in anticipation of rising inflation pressure.\n\nRate hike to support rupiah\n\nBank Indonesia's reluctance to raise its policy rate has contributed to the rupiah's depreciation, as the US Federal Reserve's (Fed) aggressive rate hikes continue to strengthen the dollar against emerging-market currencies.\n\nAs of 26 September, the USD/IDR was quoted at around IDR 15,127, gaining more than 6% year-to-date as the dollar's value strengthened. Analysts, however, believed that the Bank Indonesia’s rate hike in the coming months will support the rupiah. Fitch Ratings wrote on 11 September:\n\n“The rupiah has weakened since June but the moves have been fairly muted and, with our view of higher policy rates ahead, the rupiah should remain supported.”\n\nThe firm forecast the Indonesian central bank to continue to hike the rate until it reaches 5% by end 2023, before easing in 2024. It expected the USD/IDR to average IDR 14,850 from 2022 to 2024.\n\nIndonesia inflation rate forecast\n\nBank Indonesia expected higher subsidised fuel prices to increase Indonesian inflation above its target of 3% plus or minus 1%, before returning to the target range in the second half of 2023. The bank said in a statement:\n\n“Core inflation and inflation expectations are forecast to increase due to the second-round effect of higher fuel prices and a build-up of inflationary pressures on the demand side.”\n\nIndonesia’s inflation was expected to rise to 5.8% by the end of this quarter, according to Trading Economics’ Indonesian inflation rate forecast. The price growth was projected to ease to 3.5% in 2023 and 3% in 2024.\n\nFitch Ratings’ Indonesia inflation forecast saw the country’s annual inflation rate averaging 4.2% in 2022, before cooling to 3% in 2023 and 2024.\n\nIn its forecast on 22 September, Bank of America (BofA) expected Indonesian inflation to peak at 6% in December 2022, gradually falling to Bank Indonesia’s target of 3% by the end 2023.\n\nIn its 5 September forecast, ING predicted the Indonesia inflation rate to average 4.1% in 2022, 3.6% in 2023 and 3.5% in 2024.\n\nRemember that analysts' predictions can be wrong. Forecasts should not be used as a substitute for your own research. Always conduct your own due diligence before trading or investing. And never trade with money you can't afford to lose.\n\nFAQs\n\nIs inflation high in Indonesia? The current Indonesia inflation rate is 4.69%, as of 26 September 2022. It was considered high for Indonesia’s standard, but relatively low compared to inflation in developed nations. What causes Indonesian inflation? Inflation from administered prices, such as airplane tickets, household fuel and cigarettes, and volatile food groups were the main drivers for the peak reading in July. Does Indonesia have a stable economy? Indonesia has a relatively stable economy. Despite rising inflation, the Indonesian central bank expected the country’s economy to grow 4.5% to 5.3% in 2022. Note that analyst predictions can be wrong.\n\nFurther reading",
    "The ultimate guide to Raja Ampat, Indonesia": "The 1500 islands, cays and shoals that make up Raja Ampat lie on prime real estate at the heart of the Coral Triangle, a biodiversity hot spot where the Pacific and Indian Oceans collide.\n\nLikened to the “Amazon of the seas,” this tropical labyrinth holds one of the world’s highest densities of marine life with over 1000 species of fish and three-fourths of all known corals. Divers and snorkelers alike dip into the aquamarine waters here in search of wildly-patterned carpet sharks, massive manta rays and pygmy seahorses. Up above, they find bungalows perched over the ocean and palms curving toward pearly beaches devoid of any footprints.\n\nEach of the main islands – or “Four Kings” as they’re known – hides its own wonders, including mesmerizing mushroom-shaped outcrops, placid turquoise lagoons and misty hills where flamboyantly-feathered fowl parade across the canopy in search of a mate. To visit now is to experience a virgin paradise on the verge of discovery.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know to plan the perfect trip to Indonesia's Raja Ampat.\n\nMake the most out of every adventure with help from our weekly newsletter delivered to your inbox.\n\nWaigeo is home to the region's small capital\n\nIf sleepy Raja Ampat has any whiff of a buzz, you’ll find it on Waigeo or its satellite islands Gam, Kri and Arborek. Home to the region’s diminutive capital, Waisai, this is the most logical base from which to plan journeys further afield. Waigeo is the place where British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace based himself in 1860 while studying the birds-of-paradise, a group of 44 lavishly attired birds only found around New Guinea and north-eastern Australia. Research in the jungles here played a pivotal role in his landmark theory of evolution through natural selection, which was published jointly with the more famous Charles Darwin. You can find Wallace’s subjects fluttering about in the hills on the island’s southern edge, as well as on neighboring Gam.\n\nExplore the secluded lagoons around Misool Island © iStockphoto / Getty Images\n\nMisool is the most isolated of the \"Four Kings\"\n\nMisool is the most visually arresting of the four main islands. It’s also the most isolated at the southern end of the archipelago. Its southeastern edge is a veritable fortress of towering karst formations that rise out of the sea like shards of green glass. Many of these formations hide secluded lagoons that are perfect for snorkeling or kayaking. Yet, the main draw here is scuba diving in the crystalline waters of the 300,000-acre (1220 sq km) Misool Marine Reserve, established in 2005. The island also features pearl farms, caves, prehistoric rock art and two lakes where you can swim with thousands of (harmless) golden jellyfish.\n\nSalawati and Batanta are the least visited of the \"Four Kings\"\n\nDespite being closest to mainland New Guinea, Salawati and Batanta are the least visited of the “Four Kings.” Salawati is an untouched island that lies directly across the Sele Strait from the Bird's Head Peninsula. It has little in the way of tourist attractions or infrastructure. Batanta is a long, thin island just north of it that’s home to a few tiny fishing villages. You’ll also find a handful of homestays and dive resorts along Batanta’s northern edge, as well as on the smaller satellite islands just off the coast.\n\nDiving is one of the main activities in Raja Ampat © TONY MYSHLYAEV / Stocksy United\n\nWhat to do in Raja Ampat\n\nDive (or snorkel) in Misool’s protected waters\n\nDivers from around the world flock to Raja Ampat’s clear waters to spot soaring manta rays, giant clams, iridescent parrotfish, rare dugongs and swarming schools of yellowback fusiliers. Its unspoiled reefs are home to more than ten times the number of hard coral species found in the Caribbean. In the protected waters of the Misool Marine Reserve, you can find blue staghorns, orange sea whips and chunky brain corals, among countless others. The reserve’s disparate dive sites are best visited from a liveaboard boat or a Misool-area dive resort.\n\nHike to the birds-of-paradise\n\nWalk in Wallace’s footsteps in search of the aptly named birds-of-paradise, whose elaborate courtship dances were a highlight of the BBC's original Planet Earth series. The southern coasts of Waigeo and Gam offer the best chance for sightings, with forests that harbor two species. The larger red bird-of-paradise has crimson wings, emerald cheeks, yellow shoulder tufts and wispy purple tail feathers, while the smaller Wilson's bird-of-paradise has a startling cyan cap, a red-and-black body, blue feet and tail feathers shaped like a scissor handle. Local guides run tours to see the birds along private-access trails that often begin behind their homes. Accommodation providers can arrange trips, which typically involve a pre-dawn hike up to a crude viewing blind near a popular mating area.\n\nAnd there are plenty of snorkeling opportunities for non-divers © Rudhie68 / Shutterstock\n\nVisit Arborek Village\n\nTiny Arborek Village (population around 200) offers a glimpse of more traditional Papuan culture, with elders who still make a living weaving and children who have revived Papuan dancing. The people who live in Arborek (an island just off the coast of Waigeo) migrated here from the hills of the mainland in the 1930s, and their dances tell the story of the transition from being hunters to fishers. Meanwhile their woven crafts – made from the dried leaves of the pandanus tree and local dyes – often take the shape of manta rays and other sea creatures found in the nearby waters. You can frequently spot kids rehearsing dances in front of the town church, while crafts are sold directly from the homes of weavers.\n\nClimb Pianemo Hill\n\nWant that classic Raja Ampat shot with pincushions of bush-clad rock floating in the turquoise sea? You’ll need to climb to the top of Pianemo Hill, a hunk of honeycombed karst in the Fam Islands group (between Batanta and Waigeo) that’s covered in spindly pandanus and gum trees. Some 250 wooden steps lead through the dense vegetation up to a platform at the top, where the five points of a star-shaped lagoon come into view. Two overlooks nearby jut out over the edge for picture-perfect panoramas. You can find similar views 30km (19 miles) beyond Waigeo at Wayag, a remote collection of atolls often featured in promotional materials.\n\nChoose between budget homestays to luxurious waterside bungalows © iStockphoto / Getty Images\n\nWhere to stay in Raja Ampat\n\nThe quality of homestays varies\n\nThe cheapest and most authentic way to sleep in Raja Ampat is to book a village \"homestay.\" The name is a bit deceiving; you won’t actually sleep in anyone’s home, but rather in a bungalow nearby. Stay Raja Ampat is like the Airbnb of family-owned budget options, giving an online presence to rural accommodation providers. Most homestays come with full board, though hospitality standards and quality vary widely. Recommended options include Kordiris Homestay and Corepen Homestay on Gam Island, as well as the more remote Mandemor Homestay on Batanta.\n\nDive resorts range from comfortable to luxurious\n\nDive resorts were the first to put Raja Ampat on the map, and they remain the most comfortable – often downright luxurious – options around. Some have overwater bungalows and beach bars; others spas and farm-to-table restaurants. The best properties, such as Misool Eco Resort and MahaRaja Eco Dive Lodge, have been instrumental in safeguarding some of the most biodiverse reefs on earth through conservation initiatives and community empowerment.\n\nLiveaboard boats are ideal if you want to explore the archipelago\n\nResorts and homestays typically tie you to one island, but if you want to tour the entire archipelago, there’s really no substitute for a liveaboard boat. Several Indonesian cruises include quick stops in Raja Ampat, but to spend more time here, you’ll want to book an option departing from Sorong. Most ships run five- to 11-day itineraries with a focus either on diving or land excursions. Others, such as SeaTrek, invite experts onboard for themed trips in search of whale sharks or the elusive birds-of-paradise. In general, rates for liveaboards start at around $140 per day, all-inclusive.\n\nGetting to Raja Ampat and around\n\nRaja Ampat lies off the west coast of the world’s second-largest island, New Guinea, which is shared between Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. Most visitors arrive by plane at Domine Eduard Osok Airport in Sorong, which lies in Indonesia’s West Papua province and receives regular flights from Jakarta. Daily ferries depart from Sorong’s harbor to Waigeo, while twice-weekly ferries head to Misool. Chartered speedboats are available at the harbor for more direct trips to your accommodation.\n\nLocal carrier Susi Air flies light planes (with a 10kg/22lb baggage allowance) from Sorong out to Marinda Airport in Waisai (Waigeo), the only airport in the archipelago.\n\nAll visitors will transit Raja Ampat Marine Park and must pay the Environmental Services Fee (700,000 rupiah). Visitors to select tourist sites will have to pay an additional 300,000 rupiah for the Raja Ampat Visitor Entry Ticket, introduced in 2019.\n\nWhen to go to Raja Ampat\n\nThere’s no bad time to go to Raja Ampat, which lies on the equator and enjoys relatively consistent temperatures of between 31ºC (89ºF) and 25ºC (78ºF). June, July and August are historically the wettest months, but the monsoon seasons here are not as dramatic as elsewhere in Southeast Asia. Rainfall is often short-lived and localized.

    "Smoke and mirrors in Indonesia as giant gas projects struggle": "Register here for the Energy Voice daily newsletter, bringing you key news and insight from across the global energy landscape.\n\nIndonesia has an ambitious target to almost double natural gas production from 6.5 billion cubic feet per day (cf/d) to 12 billion cf/d by 2030. Hitting that goal means giant undeveloped gas projects, such as Inpex’s Masela and Chevron’s IDD, must proceed rapidly.\n\nThe trouble is these projects have stalled in recent years, largely because of political meddling, as well as the rising trend towards resource nationalism under President Joko Widodo’s watch since he took power in October 2014.\n\nDwi Soetijpto, the head of Indonesia’s upstream regulator SKK Migas, is under pressure from Widodo, known locally as Jokowi, to get Masela and the Indonesian Deepwater Development (IDD) moving. This explains the pronouncements, suggesting progress on these mega projects, by Dwi and other senior officials, to delegates and the media at the Indonesian Petroleum Association (IPA) conference last week in Jakarta.\n\nJapan’s Inpex (TYO:1605), which leads Masela, will submit yet another revised plan of development by the end of the year. At the same time, an Indonesian consortium led by Pertamina is being steered by Jokowi to buy Shell’s (LON:SHEL) 35% share of Masela. Shell’s desire to divest – triggered by Jokowi’s previous decision in 2016 to cancel a government-approved plan of development for FLNG at the block – has been an impediment for the project.\n\nDwi reckons Inpex will take a final investment decision (FID) by end of 2023, while Inpex has said FID is expected in the second half of the 2020s. Inpex’s forecast is more realistic, as a new plan of development needs to be hammered out with the government. And, crucially, a tricky divestment – that involves Japanese-backed loans and various Indonesian stakeholders – needs to be negotiated with Shell.\n\nChevron Divestment\n\nMeanwhile, if Dwi is to be believed, Italy’s Eni (MIL:ENI) is close to buying out Chevron (NYSE:CVX) from the IDD project. The US giant put its 62% share of IDD up for sale three years ago after failing to agree attractive terms and conditions with the Indonesian government that would allow the development to compete for investment capital within Chevron’s global portfolio.\n\nBut market sources suggest the government is again jumping the gun with its pronouncements. It is true that Eni would be the logical buyer. The Italian company, which already operates fields nearby in the Kutei basin, is currently a minority shareholder in the IDD with a 20% interest, along with China’s Sinopec, which holds the remaining 18% share.\n\nPresumably, if Dwi is correct, Eni will increase its stake, but the Italian company is unlikely to operate the IDD with an 82% interest. No doubt Pertamina will be offered a stake in the project and Sinopec might need to be persuaded to boost its shareholding. UK-based Neptune Energy, a partner of Eni, could also be in the mix too.\n\nStill, sources suggest there is no urgency to finalise the sale of IDD. There are interested buyers and discussions are making progress. However, all parties share the mantra that a “bad deal is worse than no deal” and a final agreement seems someway off just now.\n\nA successful divestment deal would see Chevron, previously one of Indonesia’s largest oil and gas investors, left with no operated-upstream assets in the country after it handed the giant Rokan Block to Pertamina last year. Chevron’s request to extend their Rokan PSC was refused in July 2018 in favour of Pertamina as part of Jokowi’s resource nationalism drive to hand legacy production to the national oil company.\n\n© Supplied by IPA\n\nDownsizing\n\nAs Chevron downsized its operations the supermajor vacated four of its five office floors in a Jakarta building. Inpex, which shared the same building, took over all the space vacated by Chevron, presumably to beef up its Masela project resources. Ironically, the Japanese company has now returned it all and keeps only one floor in the office tower. This would fit with the waning enthusiasm from Tokyo for the proposed Abadi liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in the Masela Block in recent times.\n\nStill, there is a glimmer of hope for Masela. The war in Ukraine has put energy security top of the agenda within the Japanese government and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida appears to be putting his weight behind Jokowi’s drive to revive the project.\n\nJokowi, whose final presidential term ends in 2024, will “move mountains to make Masela happen” as part of his closing legacy before leaving office, noted a senior industry executive. Pertamina will be pushed to buy Shell out of the project and Inpex could find itself in a good position to negotiate favourable commercial terms and conditions with the Indonesian government.\n\nElsewhere, the BP-led Tangguh LNG project reported record gas production from trains one and two in September. Its long-delayed expansion project that will add a third train is also due to come online in 2023, which will provide a welcome boost for Indonesia’s upstream. But hitting the 2030 gas production target still looks like a stretch just now without urgent radical action.",
    "Emissions and deforestation set to spike under Indonesia’s biomass transition": "Indonesia’s cofiring program — reducing the amount of coal used in power generation by cutting it with wood pellets — will result in massive deforestation and a net emissions surge, an energy policy think tank warns.\n\nUnder the government’s 10% biomass cofiring plan, up to 1.05 million hectares (2.59 million acres) of forest could be cleared for acacia and eucalyptus plantations to provide wood pellets.\n\nThis would result in up to 489 million metric tons of emissions — a vastly greater amount than the 1 million tons in reduced emissions that cofiring is expected to achieve.\n\nThe analysis, by Trend Asia, also shows that, if anything, Indonesia’s coal consumption has only increased with higher biomass cofiring, and that this trend is expected to continue through 2030 as more new coal plants are built.\n\nJAKARTA — Indonesia’s program to wean itself off coal by burning it alongside progressively higher amounts of woody biomass will threaten more than a million hectares of rainforest and result in massive net carbon emissions, a new analysis shows.\n\nThis process of cutting coal with materials such as wood pellets, oil palm kernels and sawdust is known as cofiring, and has been touted by the government as a key method of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants, which generate most of Indonesia’s electricity.\n\nThe plan is to increase the portion of biomass burned in coal plants to 10%, which the government says will require 9 million metric tons of biomass annually.\n\nBut the more realistic figure is 10.2 million metric tons, according to Trend Asia, an Indonesian think tank that focuses on the clean energy transition. And there’s no way that amount of biomass will come from agricultural or urban waste, meaning the bulk of it will have to come from large-scale forest plantations, Trend Asia said in a recent analysis.\n\nThese would require 2.33 million hectares (5.7 million acres) of land — an area roughly 35 times the size of Jakarta — according to Trend Asia. And nearly half of it would have to be newly established — which in many cases means clearing standing forest for acacia and eucalyptus — given that Indonesia’s current annual production of wood pellets is less than 1 million metric tons.\n\nMeike Inda Erlina, renewable energy campaigner at Trend Asia, said the resulting deforestation — between 1 million and 1.05 million hectares (2.47 million to 2.59 million acres), depending on the mix of acacia and eucalyptus — would amount to a tremendous loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services.\n\n“There’s biodiversity [in our forests] that supports our lives as human, and there’s also lots of people whose livelihoods depend on forests, especially those who live in forest areas, such as Indigenous peoples,” she said at the recent launch of Trend Asia’s analysis. “All these have immeasurable values which the state can’t pay [back].”\n\nDarmawan Prasodjo, president of state-owned utility PLN, said the cofiring program would provide a source of livelihood to local communities growing acacia and eucalyptus trees for wood pellets. He also said there was plenty of non-forest “deserted” land on which they could be grown, including 800,000 hectares (2 million acres) just on the island of Java.\n\nMore emissions than reductions\n\nThe carbon dioxide emissions associated with clearing forests for new energy plantations, as they’re known, would far exceed any reductions achieved from cofiring, Trend Asia’s analysis shows.\n\nUnder the 10% cofiring scenario, Indonesia’s 52 biggest coal-fired power plants could expect a combined reduction in emissions of 1 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent (CO2e). But the cost of achieving this — the deforestation to make way for the acacia and eucalyptus plantations — would result in emissions of 469 million to 489 million metric tons CO2e, according to Trend Asia.\n\n“The problem is, based on the [large] amount of biomass needed, the figure [of reduced power plant emissions] is too low,” said Trend Asia researcher Mumu Muhajir.\n\nHe added the amount of coal that Indonesia burns is expected to keep increasing through 2030, even if the cofiring program is fully implemented. This goes against the government’s own touting of the cofiring program as a way to transition away from fossil fuels to renewable energy, he said.\n\nThe increase in coal use is already evident: When the amount of biomass used in cofiring increased significantly from 9,731 metric tons in 2020 to 282,628 metric tons in 2021 — a 28-fold jump — the amount of coal burned also increased, from 66.68 million to 68.47 million metric tons.\n\n“So why don’t we see a decrease in coal consumption?” Mumu said.\n\nThat’s because while the government pledged last year to retire 9.2 gigawatts of coal-fired power plants by 2030, it also plans to build 13.8 GW of new coal plants during the same period. That means a net increase in coal capacity this decade. And if anything, Mumu said, the cofiring program will only prolong the life of coal power plants.\n\n“This will become a double catastrophe,” he said. “Carbon emissions from coal will keep rising because of the increase in consumption, but then we also use cofiring from biomass whose emissions from deforestation we will have to pay for over the next 20 years.”\n\nThe increase in coal burning to generate electricity will also add to the state’s financial strain, Mieke said. She noted that each 1 GW of additional electricity generation costs the government 1.36 trillion rupiah ($91 million). But the country’s power grid is already oversupplied by 5 GW, translating into nearly half a billion dollars of electricity that the government is paying for but can’t sell.\n\nRegulatory support\n\nYet despite all the concerns over the sustainability of burning biomass in coal-fired power plants, the government has issued several regulations in support of the policy.\n\nAmalya Reza Oktaviani, campaign manager at watchdog group Forest Watch Indonesia, said regulations issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry make it easier for companies to acquire forest concessions for “energy security” purposes. In these cases, companies don’t have to wait until a land demarcation process is completed finished in order to start developing the concessions — which in many cases means clearing the forest.\n\nCompanies would also be eligible for larger concessions than usual, up to 60,000 hectares (148,000 acres) per province, or 300,000 hectares (741,000 acres) nationally, and wouldn’t require approval from provincial governors, Amalya said at the launch of the Trend Asia report.\n\nThese companies would also be exempt from paying non-tax revenue and from the obligation to rehabilitate watershed areas, she said.\n\nAs of 2020, there were 14 companies developing more than 156,000 hectares (nearly 386,000 acres) of energy plantations, according to data from the forestry ministry, with another 18 companies plan to join the rush.\n\nAlso for “energy security” purposes, the government has designated 5.4 million hectares (13.3 million acres) of forest area that may be cleared for plantations, according to FWI. Not all of it will necessarily be cleared, Amalya said, but the point is that this potential deforestation “is in the law.”\n\n“So we can see that [deforestation for energy plantations] is legalized,” she said.\n\nBanner image: A truck carrying acacia logs in Indonesia in 2014.

    "Indonesia Launches Information Aggregator Website": "The information from numerous ministries and institutions, even local governments, will now be combined into one website. The aggregator website Indonesiakini.go.id has been launched by the Ministry of Communication and Information.\n\nThis action will make it simpler for the public to obtain reliable information on the numerous policies and initiatives that the government has implemented and will continue to implement.\n\n“We hope that with this website, the public can find out the current situation, and condition of Indonesia by just clicking on one website. The existence of this website makes public communication more integrative, more orchestrated in the eyes of the citizens,” says Usman Kansong, Director General of Information and Public Communication of the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology.\n\nThe Director General outlined how Indonesia’s presence will undoubtedly address the difficulties of rapid, widespread, and integrated public communication. He continued by saying that the dynamics of information and communication technologies that cause the disruption make it difficult for government institutions to handle public information and communication in a way that allows for adaptive public consumption.\n\nIt must be acknowledged, nonetheless, that not all local governments, organisations, or ministries have combined their material into a single repository. Communication activities must be adjusted to the changing public communication landscape in government institutions to facilitate the public’s access to information.\n\nThe Ministry of Communication and Information has the responsibility to coordinate the planning, preparation, and implementation of public communications related to policies and programmes of the government, in accordance with Presidential Instruction Number 9 of 2015 concerning the Management of Public Communication.\n\nThe Ministry is also responsible for organising information into a single narrative for the Presidential Instruction. The presence of Indonesia will undoubtedly be the ideal setting for bringing together the various government channels.\n\nThe public will now have easier access to information about the government’s development initiatives. The four information channels held by the Ministry of Communication and Informatics will soon be integrated into the Indonesian aggregator website.\n\nThis includes 115 universities, 34 provincial governments, 98 city governments, and 416 district governments. There are also 37 additional ministry sites, 7 institutions, 2 sites run by the presidential palace, and 37 other sites.\n\nIndonesia has collected 588 websites belonging to various institutions, local governments, and ministries. 746 locations total, or 79 per cent of the target, have been reached.\n\nMeanwhile, residents of South Sulawesi, particularly Makassar City, are prepared for the end of analogue television broadcasts and the subsequent transition to digital television broadcasts. In July 2022, periodic opinion polls performed by the Ministry of Communication and Information confirmed this readiness.\n\nRosarita Niken Widiastuti, a member of the Minister of Communication and Information’s Special Staff, reported that 82.94 per cent of Makassar and its surrounding residents were interested in viewing Digital TV broadcasts.\n\nThe willingness of the citizens of Makassar City cannot be separated from the contribution of the performance of the Broadcasting Institution. All 18 analogue broadcasting institutions in Makassar City and its surroundings have transitioned to digital broadcasting.\n\nFurthermore, the Director of Broadcasting of the Directorate General of Post and Information Technology at the Ministry of Communication and Information, Geryantika Kurnia, noted that there are three determinants of readiness prior to the implementation of the Analogue Switch Off (ASO) programme.\n\nAccording to the Director, 112 Service Areas are affected by ASO in Indonesia due to the prevalence of analogue television broadcasts. LPP TVRI, the Indonesian public television network, is actively constructing infrastructure for the remaining rural sites, of which 90 are already receiving digital transmissions.",

    "VP listens to aspirations of Indonesians living in Japan": "Tokyo, Japan (ANTARA) - Vice President Ma'ruf Amin on Monday listened to the aspirations of Indonesian nationals who are currently attending school or working in Japan\"I need to add that for the improvement of human resources, Japan does provide many scholarships to us as well as technical skills training, and we hope that in the future, it will also expand Japanese language teaching, vocational education, and disaster response (skills training),\" he said at the(Indonesian embassy) in Tokyo, Japan, on Monday.He made the remarks while meeting Indonesian nationals at a luncheon that was also attended by Mrs. Wury Ma'ruf Amin and Indonesian Ambassador to Japan, Heri Akhmadi, and Mrs. Nuning Wahyuniati.\"Next year, Indonesia and Japan will celebrate 65 years of Indonesia-Japan relations, and I hope that the friendly relations that have been ongoing for six decades will be even more intimate and provide welfare benefits for the people of both countries,\" he added.During the meeting, a representative from the Indonesia Community in Japan (ICJ), an association of Indonesian workers in Japan, Andi Laver, called for work safety support.\"The proposal to the Indonesian and Japanese governments is more support for friends who work in the field; many are needed such as protection of occupational safety and health and what is the next ‘next,’\" said Laver, who joined the meeting via the Zoom videoconferencing platform.Meanwhile, chair of the Japanese Nahdlatul Ulama Board, Gazali Achmadi, who is currently pursuing doctoral studies, asked for support for interns from Indonesia.\"On average, those participating in the NU branch here are dominated by apprentices with a three-year stay.

    "Indonesia Passes Historic Personal Data Protection Bill": "On 20 September 2022, Indonesia’s President and House of Representatives (DPR) approved the Personal Data Protection bill following six years of deliberation.\n\nHowever, while the PDP bill has been approved by both the President and DPR, it has not yet been signed by the President, who is required by law to ratify the PDP Law within 30 days from its date of approval. The PDP bill will become law (the PDP Law) as soon as signed by the President, or 30 days after such date of approval, whichever occurs first.\n\nThe PDP Law will be Indonesia’s first comprehensive set of rules relating to personal data protection, covering both electronic and non-electronic personal data forms. This welcome regulatory development will lead to a higher level of personal data protection in Indonesia’s growing digital economy.\n\nThe PDP Law is more closely aligned with international data privacy standards. It also introduces new concepts and removes certain restrictive provisions under the previous regime, including the requirement for both prior and post notifications to the regulator on cross-border personal data transfers.\n\nThe new law also goes further by introducing criminal sanctions for certain personal data breaches. In this way, the government is sending a strong message to both individuals and corporations that personal data protection is now being taken seriously in Indonesia.\n\nWe set out below our initial observations on the key issues we have identified in the PDP Law.\n\nExtraterritorial Reach\n\nSimilar to Law No. 11 of 2008 as amended by Law No. 19 of 2016 on Electronic Information and Transactions (the EIT Law), the PDP Law purports to have extraterritorial reach, which may impact personal data controllers and processors located outside the jurisdiction of Indonesia.\n\nArticle 2 of the EIT Law had provided that the EIT Law would apply to “any person who commits any legal action as governed under this EIT Law, both within the jurisdiction of Indonesia and outside the jurisdiction of Indonesia, which has legal effect within the jurisdiction of Indonesia and/or outside the jurisdiction of Indonesia and which harms the interest of Indonesia.” The wording “harms the interest of Indonesia” was broadly defined in the EIT Law to include “harming the interests of the national economy, strategic data protection, the nation’s dignity and status, state defence and security, sovereignty, citizens, as well as Indonesian legal entities”.\n\nArticle 2 of the PDP Law provides a slightly different scope of application compared to the EIT Law since, among other things, it no longer includes the concept of “harming the national interest”. The PDP Law applies to any person, public body or international organisation carrying out a legal action contemplated under the PDP Law, and located:\n\nwithin the Indonesian jurisdiction; and/or outside the Indonesian jurisdiction which has a legal impact (i) in the Indonesian jurisdiction and/or (ii) for personal data subjects who are Indonesian citizens located outside the Indonesian jurisdiction.\n\nThe PDP Law does not elaborate on the term “legal impact”. It remains to be seen whether the anticipated implementing regulations for the PDP Law will provide any further detail on the meaning of this term.\n\nGrounds for Processing Personal Data\n\nPrior to the enactment of the PDP Law, the prevailing laws and regulations on personal data protection in Indonesia arguably placed more of an emphasis on obtaining consent from the personal data “owners” when compared to the PDP Law. The PDP Law broadens the accepted grounds for the processing of personal data and appears to be generally more aligned with international practice.\n\nThe PDP Law requires a personal data controller to have grounds for processing personal data. The accepted grounds for processing personal data under the PDP Law include:\n\nvalid and explicit consent from the personal data subject for one or more specific purposes which have been informed by the personal data controller to the personal data subject; satisfaction of an obligation in an agreement where the personal data subject is one of the parties, or to satisfy the request of a personal data subject when entering into an agreement; satisfaction of a legal obligation of the personal data controller in accordance with laws and regulations; satisfaction of protection of personal data subject’s vital interest; implementation of tasks for the public interest, public service, or the authorised implementation of the personal data controller based on the laws and regulations; and/or satisfaction of other legitimate interests by observing the purpose, needs, and balance of interests between the personal data controller’s interests and the rights of the personal data subject.\n\nSome of the accepted grounds listed above are very broadly drafted, making their precise meaning and application in practice somewhat clear. That being said, what does seem to be clear under the PDP Law is that personal data collection and processing can be carried out without needing to obtain valid and express consent from the relevant personal data subject, provided that the personal data controller can rely on one or more of the grounds for processing personal data described above. This is a significant departure from the previous regime which required that valid and explicit consent of personal data subjects be obtained in almost all circumstances.\n\nThat being said, Article 24 of the PDP Law sets out that in processing personal data, personal data controllers are required to present evidence of consent being granted by the relevant personal data subject.\n\nApplicable Exemptions\n\nThe PDP Law is not applicable to personal data processing by individuals for personal or household purposes. It also exempts certain data controller obligations for the following interests, in the context of the implementation of laws and regulations.\n\nnational defence and security;\n\nlaw enforcement;\n\npublic interest for the purpose of state administration; or\n\nsupervision of the financial services sector, monetary and payment systems, and stability of the financial system being undertaken for the purpose of state administration.\n\nIntroduction of Personal Data “Subject”\n\nThe PDP Law introduces the term “personal data subject”. A personal data subject is defined under the PDP Law as an individual to whom personal data is attached. Under the previous regime, the term “personal data owner” was used, with largely the same definition as for “personal data subject” under the PDP Law. Considering how many parties are involved in the processing of personal data, granting ownership of personal data to a particular individual may not be appropriate, so the introduction of this new term is better aligned with international practice.\n\nRoles of Data Controllers and Data Processors\n\nThe PDP Law categorises the key players related to personal data protection as “personal data controllers”, “personal data processors” and “personal data subjects”. We have already touched on the concept of a personal data subject above.\n\nThe term “personal data controller” is briefly mentioned in Government Regulation No. 71 of 2019 on Administration of Electronic Systems and Transactions, but without elaborating on the role and its responsibilities. In general, the PDP Law better defines and separates the roles of data controllers and data processors than under the prior regulations.\n\nOnshore and Offshore Personal Data Transfers\n\nThe PDP Law enables personal data controllers to transfer personal data both domestically and offshore more easily.\n\nFor domestic transfers, Article 55 of the new law permits personal data controllers to transfer personal data to other data controllers within the Indonesian territory. Both transferor and transferee are required to protect the transferred personal data, as regulated under the PDP Law.\n\nArticle 56 of the PDP Law permits personal data controllers to transfer personal data to personal data controllers and/or processors located outside the Indonesian territory if:\n\nthe country in which the personal data controller and/or processor receiving the personal data transfer is domiciled has a degree of personal data protection equal to or higher than that contemplated under the PDP Law; in the event that the provision under (a) above cannot be satisfied, the personal data controller is required to ensure that there is adequate personal data protection and such protection is binding in nature; and/or in the event that the provisions under (a) and (b) above cannot be satisfied, the personal data subject’s consent has been obtained.\n\nThe PDP Law provides for additional provisions related to cross-border data transfers to be regulated by future implementing government regulations.\n\nIn contrast to the previous regulatory regime, the PDP Law does not require pre- and post-notification to the Ministry of Communications and Informatics (MOCI) for any cross-border data transfer. This is a significant relaxation of the old requirements applying to Indonesia-based data controllers and processors seeking to transfer personal data out of Indonesia. Again, the new approach is better aligned with international practice.\n\nThe PDP Law also implies that so long as the requirements under points (a) and (b) above have been met, a personal data subject’s consent does not have to be obtained for a cross-border data transfer to occur. Under the previous regime, the explicit consent of the personal data subject was needed to transfer personal data across borders.\n\nNotification Requirement for Merger, Spin-off, Acquisition or Consolidation of Legal Entities\n\nArticle 48 of the PDP Law requires corporate personal data controllers that wish to carry out a merger, spin-off, acquisition causing a change of control, or consolidation to notify the relevant personal data subjects of any personal data transfer that will arise from such corporate action, both before and after the corporate action has been completed.\n\nThe PDP Law provides that the requirement may be satisfied by way of a notification to the personal data subjects or via a public announcement through mass media, whether electronically or non-electronically (eg print media). Furthermore, the PDP Law provides that, in the event a corporate personal data controller is dissolved or liquidated, the storage, transfer, deletion and destruction of personal data must be done in accordance with the provisions of laws and regulations, and must be notified to the relevant data subjects.\n\nRequirement to Appoint Personal Data Protection Officer\n\nArticle 53 of the PDP Law requires personal data controllers and personal data processors to appoint officer(s) to carry out the personal data protection function in the following events:\n\nprocessing personal data for the interests of public service;\n\nthe core activity of the personal data controller by its nature, scope, and/or purpose requires the orderly and systematic supervision of personal data on a large scale; and\n\nthe core activity of the personal data controller consists of processing personal data on a large scale for personal data that is specific in nature and/or personal data related to criminal activities.\n\nA personal data protection officer is appointed based on professionalism, legal knowledge, personal data protection practice, and capability to fulfil the relevant tasks required of their role. The personal data protection officer may be recruited internally or externally by the personal data controller and/or the personal data processor.\n\nSanctions for Prohibited Use of Personal Data\n\nThe PDP Law sets out clear prohibitions on the use of personal data. Articles 65 and 66 prohibit anyone from:\n\nunlawfully obtaining or collecting personal data that is not their own with the intention for them or others to personally benefit from the personal data, potentially resulting in damage to the personal data subject; unlawfully disclosing personal data that is not their own; unlawfully using personal data that is not their own; and/or creating fake personal data or falsifying personal data with the intention for themselves or others to personally benefit from such activity and where such activity may result in damage to other persons.\n\nViolators of these provisions may face criminal sanctions – a significant new feature of Indonesia’s personal data protection regulatory framework under the PDP Law.\n\nThe PDP Law sets out three types of criminal sanctions for violating the above prohibitions:\n\nfinancial penalties – individuals may face a fine of up to Rp 6 billion (USD 400,000) and corporations a fine of up to Rp 60 billion (USD 4 million); imprisonment – individuals may face up to six years of incarceration; or “other” potential additional penalties that can be imposed on corporations, including the possible seizure of profits/assets derived from a crime; freezing of all or part of a corporation’s business; permanent prohibition to carry out certain actions; closure of place of business and/or activities of a corporation; having to fulfil obligations that had been neglected; an award of damages; revocation of business licences; and/or dissolution of the corporation.\n\nFor corporations, the PDP Law provides that criminal sanctions may be imposed on members of management (ie, board of directors), controllers, those giving orders (pemberi perintah) and beneficial owners (among others). The imposition of prison sentences may also extend to these parties.\n\nThrough the introduction of these criminal sanctions under the PDP Law, the Indonesian government is sending a strong message to individuals and corporations that personal data protection must be taken seriously in Indonesia.\n\nArticle 57 sets out administrative sanctions for violating certain provisions of the PDP Law. These administrative sanctions may be in the form of:\n\na written warning;\n\ntemporary suspension of personal data processing activity;\n\ndeletion or destruction of personal data; and/or\n\nan administrative fine.\n\nArticle 57 also allows for administrative fines to be imposed for violating certain provisions of the PDP Law. These fines can be a maximum of 2 percent of the annual revenues of the offending party. This 2 percent threshold is notably lower than that required under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is set at a maximum of 4 percent of global annual revenues. The administrative fine will be imposed by the supervisory body for personal data protection administration, which is yet to be established (described further below).\n\nNotification Requirement for Breach\n\nIn the event of failure by a personal data controller to protect personal data, Article 46 of the PDP Law requires a personal data controller to deliver a written notice to the relevant personal data subject(s) and the supervisory governmental body (as described below) within 3 x 24 hours after any failure to protect personal data. This is much shorter than the 14-day period under the previous regime.\n\nPersonal data protection failure is described as failure to protect someone’s personal data in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of personal data, including a security breach, whether intentional or unintentional, which leads to damage, loss, amendment, disclosure, or access that is not valid in relation to the relevant personal data that is sent, stored, or processed.\n\nThe written notification must set out details of the disclosed personal data, when and how the personal data was disclosed, and details regarding how the matter is being handled including any relevant recovery efforts made by the personal data controller. In certain cases, among others where the personal data protection failure disturbs public service and/or has a serious impact on the public interest, personal data controllers may also be required to inform the public regarding the personal data protection failure.\n\nSupervisory Body for Personal Data Protection Administration\n\nThe PDP Law provides that the Indonesian government will participate in personal data protection administration in accordance with the PDP Law, which is to be done through a governmental body (lembaga) to be stipulated by the President of Indonesia. At this stage, the name, details and discretionary powers of the governmental body are not yet known. The PDP Law provides that further provisions relating to this governmental body will be regulated by a future presidential regulation.\n\nTransitional Period\n\nUnder Article 74 of the PDP Law, personal data controllers, personal data processors and other parties relevant to the processing of personal data have up to two years from the date of enactment of the PDP Law to comply with the law.\n\nArticle 75 of the PDP Law adds that all existing provisions of laws and regulations which regulate personal data protection will remain valid so long that as they do not contradict the provisions of the PDP Law. A careful process of statutory interpretation will be needed to identify any overlaps and gaps in personal data protection between the old regulatory regime and the new regime under the PDP Law.\n\nAs is typical in Indonesia, implementing regulations for the PDP Law can be expected in the coming months. In this regard, please monitor this space for the latest developments in implementation of the PDP Law in Indonesia.",
    "Indonesia’s obligations to its people and the planet": "The government of Indonesia has postponed the implementation of its carbon tax to iron out its wrinkles, but it must remember that time is of the essence, Yetty Komalasari Dewi writes.\n\nWhile recent international headlines on Indonesia’s economy have focused on Indonesia’s restrictive export policies, its impending carbon tax poses a more pressing policy challenge.\n\nIndonesia has been in the spotlight, having postponed the implementation of its carbon tax twice in the past year.\n\nThis has raised questions about the seriousness of the Indonesian government’s commitment to tackling climate issues. Indonesia’s G20 presidency, underpinned by the theme of transitioning to a green economy – and its own ambitious emissions target of a 29 to 41 per cent reduction by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2060 – adds to the urgency of the country’s situation.\n\nIndonesia’s proposed carbon tax was set in motion in October 2021 as part of a wider overhaul of its taxation regime, with the promulgation of Law No.7 Year 2021 on Tax Harmonization. While initially restricted to coal-fired power plants, the carbon tax will eventually apply to all sectors of the economy.\n\nImposing this carbon tax is step one of the government’s plans to transition to a low-carbon economy. Once it is implemented, the government has further plans to develop a broader carbon tax and a carbon exchange mechanism, before introducing a pilot carbon trading project in the energy sector.\n\nBoth these processes hinge upon the carbon tax, the success of which will come down to two main factors.\n\nFirstly, is the price signal is strong enough to build urgency among carbon emitters to limit their emissions?\n\nAt 30,000 Indonesian Rupiah (roughly AU$2.99) per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent emitted, some doubt the ability of such a low price to drive down emissions effectively.\n\nSecondly, will the income derived from the carbon tax be allocated to the government’s other climate efforts, namely renewable energy and its research and development?\n\nAs it stands, Indonesia’s carbon tax needs some fine tuning in both these areas.\n\nAt its current proposed rate, the tax is indeed too meagre to serve as a strong disincentive to reduce emissions. Meanwhile, the details of Indonesia’s national economic recovery program are inconsistent with its lofty climate goals, as it remains heavily reliant on fossil fuels to sustain the country’s energy needs.\n\nFor instance, the state still provides trillions of rupiah to fossil fuel-dominated state-owned enterprises, casting doubt on whether the proceeds from a carbon tax would really go towards creating a greener economy.\n\nAlso, while the carbon tax could be a groundbreaking policy, the story of its postponement shows that the government lacks the experience and initiative to enact it properly.\n\nIn the face of uncertain global economic conditions and rising domestic inflation, the government needed to consider the potential of legal risks arising out of its carbon tax, particularly disputes with emitters, when it designed it.\n\nIts failure to do this is part of the reason the carbon tax is still on the shelf – relevant agencies need more time to settle outstanding issues and to implement the complex regulations necessary for the tax to take effect.\n\nWhile existing taxation measures are subject to appeal through Indonesia’s administrative courts, the carbon tax may by subject to international investment disputes if its implementation is unfair or arbitrary, which the government will want to avoid. This is especially risky for a government that has just begun acquainting itself with its new policy measure.\n\nTo address this, Indonesian policymakers must closely consider Indonesia’s international obligations in accordance with investment protection provisions under various international instruments.\n\nThey must mitigate the risk of investment disputes arising in connection to the implementation of the carbon tax if the policy is to be a success.\n\nOnce implemented, it is paramount that the carbon tax aligns with the government’s climate targets, while accounting for the interests of business actors and investors.\n\nOn investment, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati mentioned that as a newly introduced policy, the carbon tax must also consider the social, political, and economic conditions of Indonesia, as well as its goals.\n\nU ltimately, the government needs to keep in mind the purpose of the policy – to protect the environment, and by extension, the population and the economy in a changing climate. Unlike fiscal and monetary policies, there is no wriggle room on climate. The effects and intensity of climate change do not respond quickly to the pulling of policy levers.\n\nFor sure, the government must balance climate action with businesses’ concerns, but it must stay focused on the main goal – a just transition to a low carbon economy.",

    "Bjorka, the Online Hacker Trying To Take Down the Indonesian Government": "With a series of high-profile hacks, the as-yet unidentified culprit has highlighted yawning gaps in the nation’s cyber defenses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first that Indonesia heard about the hacker now known as Bjorka came when news broke at the beginning of September of a massive data leak.\n\nSome 1.3 billion SIM card registration details were stolen and listed for sale on a dark web online marketplace. The data was harvested in part as a result of a change in policy in 2017, requiring that anyone using an Indonesian SIM card first register it in their name using their identity card, known as a KTP, and their family card, known as a KK.\n\nIf the leaks had ended there, or if Bjorka – who appears to have taken their name from the Icelandic singer Bjork – had listed more online data seemingly purely for financial gain, perhaps the story would not have gained much traction. But in the weeks after the data leak, Bjorka has attracted something of a cult following online thanks to an intriguing personal backstory and a series of spats with the increasingly frustrated Indonesian government.\n\n“I just wanted to point out how easy it is for me to get into various doors due to a terrible data protection policy. Primarily if it is managed by the government,” Bjorka posted on Twitter on September 10, using the now-suspended account @Bjorkanism.\n\nDiplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. Get the Newsletter\n\nThe hacker wasn’t wrong.\n\nEnjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.\n\n“Apart from the obvious concerns about what data Bjorka actually has, and how the leaks occurred, the case shows serious weaknesses in Indonesia’s overall approach to cybersecurity over the years,” research analyst Uday Bakhshi told The Diplomat.\n\n“Attacks happen frequently and target the government, businesses, and citizens. Prominent ministers should not be saying that the Bjorka leaks are fine,” he added.\n\nIn the days following the initial leak of the SIM card data, the Indonesian government sought to downplay Bjorka’s hacking efforts, while Semuel Abrijani Pangerapan, the director general of informatics application at the Ministry of Communication and Information, tried to reason with any would-be hackers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“If you can, don’t attack. Every time data is leaked, the people lose out, because that’s illegal access,” Pangerapan said at a press conference on September 5. “If you want to embarrass the government, find other ways to do it.”\n\nBjorka’s reply was succinct: “My message to the Indonesian government: Stop being an idiot.”\n\nFact or Fiction?\n\nBjorka has continued to post content on Twitter, despite several account suspensions, doxxing a number of Indonesian ministers and political figures and posting jibes about others, including Minister of State-Owned Enterprises Erick Thohir and the parliamentary speaker, Puan Maharani.\n\nAmongst other things, Bjorka has called out political figures about the rising cost of fuel, which has caused protests across the country. This has given the shadowy figure a kind of Robin Hood status, as a representative of the people holding the government to account, particularly after they threatened to release a database of presumably hacked information about Pertamina, the Indonesian state-owned oil and gas corporation.\n\nThis image was further bolstered when Bjorka posted a series of messages on September 11, in which they claimed that they had “a good Indonesian friend in Warsaw and he told me how messed up Indonesia is.”\n\n“I did this for him,” Bjorka added of his recent data leaks.\n\nEnjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.\n\nBjorka also mentioned that their “friend” had left Indonesia as a result of the “1965 policy” – an apparent reference to the anti-communist purges of 1965 and 1966 which saw thousands of Indonesian intellectuals, academics, activists and political figures leave the country following mass killings of suspected communist sympathizers. Between 500,000 and 1 million people are estimated to have been killed in the anti-communist purges.\n\nWhile impossible to verify, this colorful backstory added a distinctly political tone to Bjorka’s recent hacks.\n\nAnalysts told The Diplomat that, in addition to the online hijinks, Bjorka’s antics highlight the deeper question of Indonesia’s lack of preparedness around cybersecurity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“What Bjorka has done is expose the existing vulnerabilities in our data protection mechanism and regulations by showing how ‘easy’ it is to gain access to personal data across databases,” Beltsazar Krisetya, a researcher at the Department of Politics and Social Change at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, who focuses on cybersecurity issues, told the Diplomat.\n\n“What the government has done in response to the attack, ironically, exposes such vulnerabilities even further.”\n\nThe government has set up a data protection task force consisting of the National Cyber and Crypto Agency (BSSN), the Ministry of Communication and Information (Kominfo), the Indonesian National police (Polri) and the Indonesian Intelligence Agency (BIN), which Krisetya said went against the very premise of BSSN’s establishment in 2017 as the agency was set up to end overlapping authorities across government institutions dealing with cybersecurity matters.\n\n“The government’s step to create yet another authority shows how fragmented our cybersecurity governance is, and that none of the existing institutions has the coordinating authority to respond to cyber incidents,” he added.\n\nA spokesperson for the President’s Office declined to comment on the case when contacted by The Diplomat.\n\nA History of Threats\n\nData leaks, cybercrime, and hacking are issues that have long plagued Indonesia.\n\n“This isn’t the first major data breach in Indonesian history and it is very unlikely to be the last,” said Gatria Priyandita, an analyst at International Cyber Policy Centre at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. “Ultimately, the government must lead by example by ensuring that it is capable of protecting the data of everyday Indonesians by improving its own cybersecurity infrastructure,”\n\nAt the end of August, the data of over 17 million customers of the State Electricity Company (PLN) was leaked online and, earlier that same month, confidential documents from over 21,000 Indonesian companies were also released.\n\nIn 2020, the details of 91 million customers of e-commerce site Tokopedia were sold online and, the following year, the social security details of some 279 million people were leaked by hackers.\n\nOver the years, many have lamented the absence of the Personal Data Protection Bill, a piece of legislation designed to protect the data of Indonesian citizens, which languished in parliament from 2016 to 2022.\n\nThe bill was passed in a flurry of activity on Tuesday, in response to the recent leaks and means that anyone mishandling data can now be jailed for up to six years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.\n\nThere will now also be a two-year transition period as the new law takes effect.\n\n“The government pushed through the Personal Data Protection Bill, but it should have been ratified years ago, and not in response to Bjorka,” research analyst Bakhshi said, adding that, “The law should not however be the only safeguard against cybersecurity threats; there needs to be better awareness and a shift in attitudes, amongst other measures.”\n\nKrisetya agreed, telling The Diplomat that the government needs to be more active in addressing potential repercussions from already leaked personal data, and that bad actors could use such leaked personal data including names, phone numbers, and dates of birth for online fraud, harassment, abuse, or even cyber terrorism.\n\nHe also added that current priorities could seem out of touch and that “the government’s resources appear to be directed towards apprehending Bjorka, instead of patching our vulnerabilities.”\n\nFor its part, the government has made an arrest in the case, namely that of an iced drinks seller from Madiun, East Java.\n\nAccording to the man’s mother, the family does not have home internet or a laptop, but police last week charged Muhammad Agung Hidayatullah, 21, with helping Bjorka set up a Telegram channel. Hidayatullah has admitted he sold his Telegram channel to Bjorka or his administrators, but denied being a member of the hacker’s “team.” The development has only added to the public intrigue around the case.\n\nContributing to the ruckus that the case has caused is the fact that it is not clear if the hacker known as Bjorka is an Indonesian national, or if they are even in the country, something that could be an issue if the authorities wish to bring them to justice.\n\n“This is really an issue of jurisdiction,” Kosman Samosir, a lecturer in international law at Santo Thomas Catholic University in Medan, said. “If Bjorka is abroad, they would have to be extradited to Indonesia, which is not an easy thing to do.”\n\nAny requests for extradition would depend on whether Bjorka is residing in a country that has an extradition treaty with Indonesia, and whether the Indonesian authorities can build a credible case against them in order to satisfy any extradition request.\n\nLast Wednesday, Coordinating Minister for Legal, Political, and Security Affairs Mahfud MD said that the authorities are working hard to discover the hacker’s identity and are pursuing a number of credible leads in the case, a statement that Bjorka described on social media as “complete bullshit.”\n\n“The government’s failure to protect the billions of data supposedly leaked in the Bjorka attacks demonstrate the lack of interest and political will in the data security of ordinary Indonesians,” analyst Priyandita said of the recent developments\n\n“The government’s response has, thus far, demonstrated just how reactive the government has been to addressing threats in cyberspace.”",

    "Why Indonesia’s engagement with Pacific countries matters": "Last week, Indonesia’s Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi wrapped up a brief official visit to Fiji and Solomon Islands. On her agenda, apart from the usual high-level bilateral meetings, was a discussion with Filimon Manoni, the Deputy Secretary General of the Pacific Islands Forum, on how Indonesia can cooperate more deeply with the region.\n\nDespite their proximity to Indonesia, Pacific Islands countries are often overlooked in Jakarta’s foreign policy. There have been tensions between Indonesia and some Pacific Islands countries, particularly Vanuatu, which has raised the issue of human rights violations in West Papua. The Melanesian Spearhead Group, an intergovernmental organisation based in Vanuatu, has been vocal on the issue, with its secretariat even recognising the United Liberation Movement for West Papua as an observer, amid a bid for full membership.\n\nAlthough the tensions have presented obstacles between Indonesia and some Pacific Islands countries in recent years, Jakarta has acknowledged the importance of the Pacific in its foreign relations. In 2019, Indonesia introduced its Pacific Elevation – a strategy aimed at strengthening the relationship between Indonesia and Pacific Islands countries, specifically in the areas of economic cooperation, tourism and culture. In December this year, Indonesia will hold the Indonesia–Pacific Forum for Development, hosted in Bali.\n\nIndonesia needs to build trust with Pacific Islands countries on the issue of human rights.\n\nThis increasing engagement with the Pacific Islands is of strategic importance for three reasons. First, Indonesia needs to build trust with Pacific Islands countries on the issue of human rights. Vanuatu’s criticism of Indonesia’s actions in West Papua has gone all the way to the United Nations General Assembly. Indonesia has denied the claims, but addressing the situation both formally through the UN and informally through stronger engagement with Pacific Islands countries may establish a framework for remediation.\n\nSecond, from a geopolitical perspective, the Indo-Pacific has taken on a new centrality. In recent years, Indonesia has aimed to take a leadership role in the region through ASEAN. However, Pacific countries are also key players in successful Indo-Pacific engagement. Specifically, Pacific Islands countries have become an arena for US–China rivalry with some leaning towards Washington, while others have increased their cooperation with Beijing. This year, Solomon Islands signed a security pact with China, raising concerns that China could have a military presence in the country. It is, of course, the sovereign right of Solomon Islands to sign a security deal with any country it may choose, but the deal has created ripples across the region, felt especially in Australia.\n\nIndonesia has long held concerns about the region’s US–China rivalry – a key driver of Jakarta’s push for ASEAN to create an Outlook on the Indo-Pacific. In doing so, Indonesia presents itself as an alternative partner for cooperation and development in the Pacific and encourages Pacific Islands countries to maintain their neutrality amid increasing superpower rivalry.\n\nThird, Indonesia and the Pacific Islands countries face the common challenge of climate change. Issues such as sea level rise have become existential threats for littoral countries such as Indonesia and most of the Pacific Islands countries. Knowledge sharing and practical cooperation on projects such as mangrove conservation should become key priorities alongside economic and infrastructure cooperation.\n\nPerhaps the biggest challenge for Indonesia, however, in building meaningful engagement with the Pacific Islands countries, will be the limitation of resources.\n\nPacific Islands countries have taken the lead in promoting and implementing sustainable tourism. With the Indonesian tourism industry slowly recovering from Covid-19, it is important that the country learns how to engage with sustainable tourism practices. In tandem, measures to address climate change should be shared between government and community.\n\nPerhaps the biggest challenge for Indonesia, however, in building meaningful engagement with the Pacific Islands countries, will be the limitation of resources. In recent years, the provision of Indonesian aid to certain Pacific countries, presumably aimed at engaging further with the region, has come under domestic criticism, with opponents arguing that Indonesia should concentrate on local issues before engaging with foreign countries.\n\nWhichever way Indonesia decides to go, the relationship between it and the Pacific Islands countries will need to be based on mutual trust and mutual benefit for all countries involved. Indonesia, often regarded as the natural leader of ASEAN, must try to increase engagement between ASEAN and the Pacific Islands Forum. A prosperous and secure Indo-Pacific relies on it.",
    "Indonesia issues new regulation to entice investments on geothermal power plants": "Indonesia issues new regulation to entice investments on geothermal power plants\n\nJakarta at Night (Source: Flickr, CC, By: basibanget)\n\nCarlo Cariaga 15 Sep 2022\n\nA new Presidential Regulation published in Indonesia sets new selling prices for electricity from geothermal power plants, along with other incentives for attracting investments for geothermal.\n\nIndonesian President Joko Widodo has officially issued Presidential Regulation Number 112/2022 in a bid to attract more investors to develop geothermal power plants in the country. The new regulation with the title “Acceleration of Renewable Energy Development for the Provision of Electricity” sets the prices for power from renewable energy sources sold to local utility PT PLN (Persero).\n\nBetter prices for geothermal power\n\nThe purchase price of electricity from geothermal power plants is listed in Appendix I of the regulation. The prices are as follows:\n\nGeothermal power plants (wholly built by business entities and wholly or partially built by the central and regional governments)\n\n10 MW capacity, the highest benchmark price is 9.76 cents/kWh x F (location), in the first 10 years. Meanwhile, the price for the 11th – 30th years reaches 8.30 cents/kWh.\n\nCapacity 10 – 50 MW, the price is 9.41 cents/kWh x F in the first 10 years, while in years 11 – 30 years the price becomes 8.00 cents/kWh.\n\nCapacity 50 MW – 100 MW, the price is 8.64 cents/kWh x F in the first 10 years. While the 11th – 30th years are only 7.35 cents/kWh.\n\nCapacity of 100 MW and above, the price is 7.65 cents/kWh x F in the first 10 years. While the 11th – 30th years are only 6.50 cents/kWh.\n\nGeothermal steam power equivalent to electricity:\n\nCapacity – 10 MW, the highest benchmark price is 6.60 cent/kWh x F (location), in the first 10 years. While the price for years 11 – 30 reaches 5.60 cent/kWh\n\nCapacity 10 – 50 MW, the price is 6.25 cents/kWh x F in the first 10 years, while in years 11 – 30 years the price becomes 5.31 cents/kWh\n\nCapacity 50 MW – 100 MW, the price is 5.48 cents/kWh x F in the first 10 years. While the 11th – 30th years only 5.31 cents/kWh.\n\nCapacity of 100 MW and above, costs 4.48 cents/kWh x F in the first 10 years. While the 11th – 30th years are only 3.81 cents/kWh.\n\nThe magnitude of the location factor F depends on the location. The lowest values are in Java, Madura, and Bali (1.00) and the highest are in Papua (1.50).\n\nAccording to PT Supreme Energy President and CEO Nisriyanto mentioned that the current selling price of geothermal electricity was based on the Basic Cost of Supply (BPP) of electricity on the island of Java. This is currently set at a maximum of 6 cents per kWh. This means that geothermal power prices under the current regulation are higher and better. However, Nisriyanto said that it still has to be seen whether this will affect the feasibility of geothermal projects.\n\nOther development incentives\n\nAside from setting the selling price of electricity from geothermal power plants, the new regulation also has other provisions that incentivize geothermal investment. Under Article 27, the government can provide support to the implementation of geothermal development through the following means:\n\nAssignment of additional geothermal data and information;\n\nAssignment of preliminary and exploratory surveys;\n\nRisk bearing (derisking), and\n\nFinancing facilities\n\nThe announcement comes at the conclusion of the 8th Indonesia International Geothermal Convention & Exhibition (IIGCE) 2022. During the event, Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Arifin Tasrif unveiled the target of 3.3 GW installed geothermal capacity by 2030.\n\nSource: CNBC Indonesia",

Considering his gestures and commitments, Minister Mario (Campolargo) highly supports our candidacy,” Plate said after meeting with Portuguese Secretary of State for Digitalization and Modernization of Administration Affairs Mario Campolargo to discuss cooperation potentials in the digital sector.Furthermore, he stated that by becoming the ITU Council member, Indonesia would be able to propose more fair use of telecommunication and information technology, such as the satellite orbit slots and communication device spectrum arrangements, for all countries, including for developed, developing, and least developed nations.Indonesia has pushed for three agendas in its candidacy: capacity building, women's empowerment, as well as connecting the unconnected.In addition to the candidacy as the ITU Council member, Indonesia strives to gather support for the candidacy of an Indonesian telecommunication expert, Meiditomo Sutyarjoko, as a member of the ITU Radio Regulation Board (RRB).Hence, since mid-2022, the Communication and Informatics Ministry had been actively garnering support for the success of the candidacies.Numerous bilateral meetings were conducted with various representatives from several countries, such as Germany, Japan, and Portugal, to bolster international support for Indonesia’s candidacy.The attempt is expected to garner many votes for Indonesia at the ITU Council member election that will be held in coincidence with the implementation of the ITU Plenipotentiary Conference 2022 in Bucharest, Romania, from September 26 to October 14, 2022.",
    "Indonesia needs the tech training Australia and its Quad partners can provide": "Australia and the other Quad countries have committed to stepping up their engagement with Southeast Asia and the Pacific. It’s clear that economic development assistance has to be at the forefront of this new engagement. However, large-scale investments and infrastructure projects—while necessary—are difficult.\n\nThe lowest hanging piece of collaborative fruit for Australia is to deliver short-term vocational digital training at scale in the region. We should start with the most consequential of our neighbours, Indonesia. Ideally, we would partner with other Quad nations.\n\nAs we argue in a paper for the Australian National University’s National Security College, this is one of those rare opportunities where Australia’s strategic imperatives align with both its capabilities and what its neighbours actually want.\n\nThe demand in Indonesia for digital education is enormous. We spent months interviewing Indonesian government officials, academics and businesspeople. They were extremely clear on what they wanted from Australia, the Quad and others—cyber skill capacity building. This isn’t surprising. Indonesian leaders often quote World Bank data that the country needs nine million additional workers in the information and communications technology sector by 2030 to support the county’s rapidly growing digital economy.\n\nThe interviewees were also very clear as to the nature of the training: short term, large scale and technical. They want to upskill their people quickly to contribute to Indonesia’s digital revolution.\n\nThis is different to the capacity building Australia currently offers. Australia delivers a range of cyber-specific, policy-focused (not technically focused) capacity-building programs in Southeast Asia and the Pacific. It also provides longstanding degree scholarships across a range of disciplines, including a recently announced program of 10 scholarships for Indonesians to undertake a master’s or doctoral degree program in Australia.\n\nThese initiatives are welcome in recipient states and do a lot of good. But as Australia plans to expand its cyber engagement, we need to spend the extra resources that are planned for the region on what the region wants.\n\nThe strategic rationale for this type of engagement with Indonesia is also clear. Our recent paper for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace shows that Huawei has become Indonesia’s trusted cybersecurity partner. The Chinese company provides vast amounts of telecommunications hardware, including 5G equipment, for Indonesia. But beyond this, Huawei is providing training to thousands—perhaps tens of thousands—of Indonesians every year. The training is generally short term, technically focused and delivered to all levels of society, from government officials to rural students.\n\nThe Chinese government is now following its companies. Globally, China is in the early stages of establishing vocational colleges called Luban Workshops in dozens of countries to train students in subjects such as ICT. The first one was formed in Thailand in 2016. So far, it has reportedly trained more than 1,000 Thai students and 8,000 from elsewhere in Southeast Asia, likely including Indonesia. Indonesia’s first Luban Workshop was established in December 2017.\n\nChina is not popular in Indonesia, or in most of the region for that matter. Indonesia wants alternatives. As one political staffer in Indonesia said to us: ‘We are waiting for the Quad to step up.’ But, as yet, no rich liberal democracy is providing consistent feasible technical training alternatives at the same scale.\n\nIt is in Australia’s and the Quad’s interests to provide alternatives. We do not want Indonesia to become solely reliant on one country for technology or its associated capacity building. We can do little to stop China’s continued involvement, but we can ensure a more balanced reliance within Indonesia itself. There’s so much demand on the Indonesian side that neither China, Australia nor the Quad will be able to meet all of it.\n\nThis plays to our strengths. Australia does vocational training well. And the establishment of vocational training centres in Indonesia would cost less than many big infrastructure projects. It is also simpler to deliver. Infrastructure projects run into a wide range of issues such as corruption, disgruntled local landholders and environmental issues, among many other problems.\n\nIt is also an opportunity to bring other Quad countries on board. The US and Japan would likely support short-term digital education in Indonesia. Both countries also have companies with capacity. The involvement of the private sector would further bolster such a program.\n\nVocational training at scale would demonstrate that Australia, and hopefully the other Quad members, are interested in practical cooperation based on what countries in our region need. Australia and its allies and partners shouldn’t leave the task of plugging the region’s skills shortages to China and its tech titans.\n\nNot only is there a compelling development case for Australia and other Quad countries to offer technical training, but it will also serve the hard-headed strategic rationale of stopping one of our closest neighbours from being overwhelmingly reliant on Chinese technology and training.",
    "Indonesians wait for UK farm jobs after paying deposits of up to £2,500": "Indonesians dreaming of working in Britain are understood to have paid deposits of up to £2,500 to a Jakarta agency to “guarantee” jobs on UK farms that have not yet materialised.\n\nLabour experts say a deposit is considered a work-finding fee, which is illegal in the UK and Indonesia.\n\nOne worker told the Guardian he made a £1,000 down payment in July to a Jakarta agency to guarantee an agricultural job with a British recruiter, but he had not even had a job interview.\n\nHe said he was one of several people left unemployed and out of pocket on the hope of a farm job in the UK.\n\n“We stopped working to be able to seriously follow the recruitment process for a new and better job. Now we are unemployed and our fate is increasingly unclear,” he said.\n\nOfficial Indonesian government documents from late August suggest about 170 workers were stranded in Indonesia having been assigned jobs on 19 farms across the UK.\n\nA Chardonnay grape harvest in Hampshire. One worker made a £1,000 downpayment. Photograph: Luke MacGregor/Alamy\n\nMost have been unemployed for several months, waiting for jobs they believed were imminent, and almost all have been given visas to come to the UK.\n\nIt is understood there are plans to bring some of these workers to Britain, despite it being so far into the harvest season.\n\nIt follows revelations in the Guardian that Indonesian labourers harvesting berries on a farm that supplies Marks & Spencer, Waitrose, Sainsbury’s and Tesco had reported facing thousands of pounds in charges from unlicensed brokers in Bali to work for a single season in the UK. Brexit and the war in Ukraine have pushed desperate recruiters and farms to search for labour thousands of miles away.\n\nA presidential taskforce in Indonesia is investigating the circumstances of the recruitment of fruit pickers after experts said the high fees alleged could leave workers at risk of debt bondage.\n\nThe Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority is investigating whether any UK laws were broken.\n\nAndy Hall, an independent migrant rights specialist who investigates issues of forced labour in supply chains in Asia, said: “There is no legal basis either under Indonesian or UK laws to charge money to workers as a recruitment fee, whether it’s called a deposit or not. At the time a deposit is taken from a candidate, it’s an illegal recruitment fee.”\n\nHe said the risks of debt bondage leading to forced labour and the involuntary departure of a worker overseas against their will would increase significantly if deposits were taken from workers rather than prospective employers or clients.\n\nThe Indonesian workers already in Britain were supplied by AG Recruitment, one of four UK agencies licensed to recruit using seasonal worker visas. AG denied any wrongdoing and said it knew nothing about Indonesian brokers charging fees or deposits.\n\nAG had no previous experience in Indonesia and sought help from Jakarta-based Al Zubara Manpower, which in turn went to brokers on other islands who charged exorbitant fees to the people they introduced, according to one Al Zubara agent.\n\nSo far, more than 1,200 Indonesians have been placed on British farms this year by AG working alongside Al Zubara, the Guardian has learned.\n\nOf these, 207 came from Bali, where Al Zubara has no office and relies on brokers to supply candidates. A further 102 are from Lombok, where the reliance on brokers is understood to be similar.\n\nPhotograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThe managing director of AG Recruitment, Douglas Amesz, said AG only went to Al Zubara for help with advertising and to establish the demand letter, which gives formal permission to recruit workers.\n\nBut adverts seen by the Guardian give Al Zubara email addresses for applications, and under local laws only an Indonesian-licensed manpower agency can recruit. Local official paperwork suggests Al Zubara undertook the recruitment, though Amesz strongly denies this.\n\nNow an Indonesian government source says workers report Al Zubara encouraging them to pay deposits of up to 50m rupiahs (£2,500) to guarantee a job in the UK. Many are understood to be waiting to speak to AG.\n\nOne worker who had not yet been interviewed by AG or signed a contract said he had been encouraged by Al Zubara to make a down payment of about £1,000 to show his interest and guarantee a job in Britain.\n\nHe said he knew others who had done the same, and the Guardian has seen receipts for two such payments. “We know that plenty of candidates are crying every day, waiting for news from AG,” he said.\n\nAmesz said: “The making of any form of payment, termed as a deposit or otherwise, to Al Zubara (AZ), or any party, in the form of a work finding fee is illegal both in the UK and in Indonesia and is not condoned by AG in any way. Our contracts with AZ specifically make clear that no such practices would be tolerated, and that AZ is to abide by local and English law. We also made clear to each worker directly, when I conducted the recruitment in Indonesia, that they should never pay for a UK job and to report any such approaches.”\n\nAl Zubara charges £2,500 for farm jobs in the UK, according to documents seen by the Guardian. The fees include flights and visas. Multiple labourers said they faced thousands of pounds in extra charges from Indonesian brokers who brought them to Al Zubara and promised substantial earnings. Al Zubara has been contacted numerous times for comment.\n\nAdvert on al Zubara’s website, which has since been deleted. Photograph: Instagram\n\nDavid Camp, the chair of the Association of Labour Providers, of which AG is a member, said: “The GLAA’s responsibility is to conduct a full investigation and determine whether or not Al Zubara was supplying workers to AG. Al Zubara has no GLAA licence and it is a criminal offence to operate as a gangmaster without a licence or enter into arrangements for the supply of workers with an unlicensed gangmaster.”\n\nAG has strongly denied any suggestion that AZ was contracted to recruit for AG. Amesz said he did the recruiting directly in Indonesia, and that “AZ were contracted by AG to carry out services in Indonesia to help us establish the demand letter (for the work pathway) and subsequently to provide local advertising via job boards. The contracts with AZ specifically made clear that they were not to subcontract the work to third parties, nor were they to apply charges to the workers.”\n\nAG blamed Indonesian bureaucracy for delaying the allocation of work permits. Al Zubara had its licence to recruit to the UK temporarily suspended in the week after the Guardian published its first story.\n\nAG had been intending to hire from Ukraine before war broke out and had to scramble for large numbers of workers in a new market at short notice.\n\nAmesz said AG was aware of workers in Indonesia waiting to come to the UK and he had interviewed “all remaining workers to establish their individual circumstances”. He said he had interviewed candidates still in Indonesia about “what, if any, payments the workers have made and to who”.\n\nAndrew Opie, the director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, said: “Our members are aware of these allegations and remain extremely concerned. They are urgently investigating possible breaches of the scheme with suppliers.\n\n“It is clear recruiting seasonal workers has become more challenging, particularly with the loss of Ukrainian workers, and retailers will work in partnership with farmers, scheme operators, enforcers and the government this autumn to ensure all labour rights continue to be protected.”\n\nA Tesco spokesperson said the supermarket welcomed investigations in both countries, and it was “vital that any illegal fees are repaid in full”.",

    "Transformation and development in Indonesia: a 50-year view": "Over the past 60 years, Indonesia has been transformed: it has gone from the economic and political chaos of Sukarno’s ‘guided democracy’—a near-failed state and regional pariah—to become an economically successful democracy and regional leader, with a middle class of 25 million.\n\nHow did this transformation occur? The British economist John Maynard Keynes famously extolled the power of ideas. What was the source of the policy ideas that drove Indonesia’s remarkable transformation?\n\nIndonesia had to rebuild its sadly depleted institutions during this period, including non-official sources of advice that would reflect a range of community thinking.\n\nThe Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Jakarta provided a valuable leavening to the military-oriented New Order government that came to power in 1966. The story of the first 50 years of CSIS illustrates the beneficial power of well-considered and well-articulated policy ideas. That story is told by Australian economist Peter McCawley, a former dean of the Asian Development Bank Institute and a lifetime scholar of Indonesia, in 50 years of CSIS: ideas and policy in Indonesia.\n\nCSIS describes itself as ‘a policy-oriented research institution that focuses primarily on strategic thinking in international relations, domestic politics and economic issues’. But its remit and operations have stretched way beyond those of a conventional think tank. It has been a direct and influential force in the policymaking process, close to Suharto for the first two vital decades of his three-decade era and an important policy voice for more than 50 years.\n\nThe diverse and close influence of the centre reflected the unusual composition of the founders and patrons. Three were army generals who had long been close associates of Suharto. Others had been active leaders of the student movement in the 1960s that toppled Sukarno and participated in the dramatic transition to Suharto. Most of the civilian founders were ethnic Chinese who had to work around the tensions implicit in their ethnicity in a society always susceptible to racial division.\n\nIn 1965, Indonesia transitioned via a dramatic coup attempt that installed the second president, Suharto, accompanied by a bloody score-settling between Muslims (backed by the army) and communists.\n\nBeginning the next year, Suharto’s New Order government tamed hyperinflation and rescheduled crippling overseas debt. The armed ‘confrontation’ with Malaysia was unwound and the key regional cooperation framework of ASEAN was established in 1967 with Indonesia’s role reflecting its demographic weight. In all this, the founders of CSIS played an influential role, beginning even before CSIS was formally created.\n\nA degree of normality had been re-established by 1971, when the centre was formally founded. This inauguration coincided with a transition to more orderly policymaking. Suharto was now firmly established in power and held the first election since 1955. CSIS staff were not part of the new administration but were influential advisers with strongly articulated policy ideas.\n\nThe key CSIS specialisation was in security and foreign affairs. After the destructive foreign policies of Sukarno, the New Order moved quickly to end the conflict with Malaysia and to re-establish relations with the UN and its agencies such as the International Monetary Fund and—most importantly—the region. Indonesia returned to the ‘free and active’ foreign policy that had guided the historic Bandung Conference in 1955.\n\nCSIS gave high priority to ‘second-track diplomacy’ (supplementing formal contacts through unofficial channels) focused on the region. It played an important role in restoring economic relations with Japan, which would become a vital supplier of investment and aid to Indonesia for the next 50 years.\n\nRelations with China were strengthened too. With most of the founders being ethnic Chinese, CSIS was always going to be conscious of China. It worked towards the 1990 restoration of relations after a 23-year hiatus. CSIS leaders argued that the need was to engage China rather than to contain its role, while at the same time regional arrangements in Southeast Asia needed to be strengthened as the best hedging mechanism against China’s dominance.\n\nIn macroeconomics, CSIS played second fiddle to the well-known ‘Berkeley mafia’ of economic technocrats led by Indonesia’s senior economic minister, Widjojo Nitisastro. The centre staked out its own area of expertise in regional trade, and its relevance was illustrated when Mari Pangestu, former executive director of CSIS, was appointed trade minister in 2004. More recently, in 2020 President Joko Widodo supported her appointment as a managing director of the World Bank.\n\nOn domestic political issues, the integration of Papua following the 1969 ‘Act of Free Choice’ began a long period of involvement in the intractable problems of Papua, followed by an active interest in the vexed issues of Timor and Aceh. CSIS was active in the ‘reform’ era after 1999, including responding to the many challenges of decentralisation.\n\nThe centre’s close relationships with a number of Jakarta’s foreign embassies served not only as an inside track to inform foreign governments of Indonesian official thinking and interpret events from an Indonesian viewpoint, but also as a channel of feedback to Indonesia policymakers at the highest level. Timor’s painful journey from Portuguese colony to independent nation provides perhaps the clearest example.\n\nSeveral key lessons for the work of think tanks in other developing countries in Asia stand out from the success of CSIS. One is that ideas are important. The community of activists and scholars who worked in CSIS believed in the need for reform in many sectors in Indonesia and they were effective in arguing their case. This meant that their views were interesting and that policymakers found it useful to engage with CSIS.\n\nA second lesson is that pragmatic and active engagement with senior levels of government, political parties, and other leading community groups such as religious organisations and the business community strengthen the role that a think tank can play. Think tanks often describe themselves as non-partisan, but in the febrile environment of post-Sukarno Indonesia, such a commitment would have constrained a think tank to policy irrelevance. CSIS was often on one side of contentious issues. It was clearly a supporter of Suharto, especially before a bitter falling-out with the presidential palace that occurred in 1988. Indeed, sometimes CSIS’s thinkers were defined by what they opposed. Pluralism was vital to their vision of Indonesia, so they were at loggerheads with those Muslim groups that wished to establish an Islamic state—a vexed issue since independence.",

    "Faced with grouper, snapper decline, Indonesia adopts harvest strategy": "Indonesia is adopting a harvest strategy for grouper and snapper in the east of the country, where catch volume and average fish landed are down.\n\nThe areas targeted are a major global supplier of the fish, given that Indonesia is responsible for 45% of global snapper and grouper sales.\n\nThe new regulations on gear and total boats targets restoration of fish stocks for seven species.\n\nMAKASSAR, Indonesia — Indonesia is drafting a harvest strategy for snapper-grouper fisheries as part of a fisheries management plan for WPPNRI 713, the fisheries management area that borders the islands of Borneo, Sulawesi, Bali and Flores and encompasses the Makassar Strait, Bone Bay, Bali Sea and Flores Sea. The new regulations would restrict the number of permits available and introduce rules on the size and types of fishing gear able to be used in the world’s largest supplier of both species.\n\nThe Indonesian fisheries ministry held a public consultation on the policy in Makassar in early August, along with the South Sulawesi provincial fisheries office and NGO partners Sustainable Fisheries Partnership (SFP) and the Indonesian Marine Conservation Foundation (YKL).\n\nIn attendance was Fery Sutyawan, coordinator of the ministry’s Management Group for Inland Marine, Territorial and Archipelagic Waters, who said the new regulations were triggered by low catch and recently tallied population estimates.\n\n“When the spawning potential ratio is below 20%, it is recommended that several steps be taken,” said Sutyawan, referring to recent estimates of the number of females, and therefore spawn or eggs, in a population, which can dwindle as fishing pressure increases.\n\nThe regulation would not affect all snapper and grouper fisheries in Indonesia. Rather, it targets three species of snapper: malabar red snapper (Lutjanus malabaricus, known colloquially as bambangan or kakap merah), goldbanded jobfish (Pristipomoides multidens, known colloquially as kakap anggoli) and rusty jobfish (Aphareus rutilans, known locally as kurisi perak); and four species of grouper: orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides, one of the many groupers known colloquially as kerapu lumpur), spotted grouper (Epinephelus areolatus, known colloquially as kerapu ekor putih), white-edged lyretail (Variola albimarginata, known colloquially as kerapu ekor gunting for its deeply forked tail) and leopard coralgrouper (Plectropomus leopardus, or kerapu sunu which is much-prized by fishermen in the live reef fish trade).\n\n“South Sulawesi [province] is a major global source for grouper fish,” said Dessy Anggraeni, SFP’s Indonesia program director. Dessy added that the ministry intended to introduce similar harvest strategies in three other fishery administrative areas.\n\nMuhammad Ilyas, the head of South Sulawesi’s provincial fishery office, saw the value in fishery regulation. “We need to change the [fishing fleet’s] mindset from quantity to quality,” he said, referring to how fishers brought in high-value species like sunu or leopard grouper with abandon, choosing not to return smaller fish to the sea and focusing on the larger individuals that might command a better price.\n\n“A strategy like this considers the long-term prosperity of fishermen,” Ilyas said. “Our task as a government is to maintain resources in a sustainable manner, so we are hoping to limit catch and restore fish stocks. To date, we have been exploiting these resources without regulation and that is no longer sustainable. This is a difficult task, particularly for leopard grouper.”\n\nEven as he championed the harvest strategy, Ilyas voiced concern over fishers who would take an economic hit when the regulations take effect.\n\n“We have to think about alternative livelihoods for fishers in these areas because we are committed to the existence of fishers,” he said.\n\nBeachside perspective\n\nIlyas’ concern was magnified at lower levels of government. Makkawaru, the head of the Selayar Islands Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Service, said the policy was difficult to implement in his archipelagic jurisdiction, where most residents have worked as fishers for generations.\n\n“We understand that this regulation is in the context of sustainable fisheries, but the problem is that fishermen have no alternative,” he said. “With population growth, the fishing fleet will grow.”\n\nJabal, a fisherman from Takalar district, South Sulawesi, agreed with Makkawaru.\n\n“On [our] island, most of the children drop out of school and automatically must go to the sea [to earn a living],” he said.\n\nErwin, a fisherman from Langkai Island outside Makassar, said reducing the fleet and limiting the type and size of fishing gear would be difficult and missed the point. “What the government needs to focus on instead is handling the prevalence of destructive fishing, such as bombs, anesthetics and trawling,” he said. “This is destroying grouper habitat.”\n\nThe ministry estimated that nine out 10 of fishermen who targeted the species were small-scale fishermen, driving or in some cases paddling boats that were 1 gross ton or less, using lines with a single hook (handline) or multiple hooks at regular intervals (longlines).\n\nBanner: A white-edged lyretail is seen in Sabah, Malaysia.

According to Arifin, access to funding and the use of technology are highly critical in geothermal development.\n\nIndonesian Geothermal Association (INAGA) Chairman Prijandaru Effendi said that the business sector is ready to push the target to an installed capacity of 17 GW by 2030. However, regulatory support will be needed to reach this target. Prijandaru mentioned how geothermal development is currently not optimal, considering that the capacity is only growing at a rate of 60 MW per year.\n\nAnother way to attract investments into geothermal projects is to reduce the risk of drilling failures by providing appropriate funding schemes. Currently, the largest source of funding for geothermal projects is still company equity. Prijandaru mentioned that local financing agency PT SMI now has a financing scheme but is only granted to state-owned enterprises. “We are waiting for the same scheme to enter the private sector,” said Prijandaru.\n\nThe recently announced Presidential Regulation is a positive step in the acceleration of the geothermal industry in Indoneisa.\n\nSource: Kontan.co.id",

    "Indonesia and Norway give REDD+ deal another go after earlier breakup": "Indonesia and Norway have embarked on another REDD+ scheme that will see the latter pay the former to keep its forests standing, after a previous attempt failed because of lack of payment.\n\nIndonesia is home to the third-largest expanse of tropical rainforest in the world, and the bulk of its greenhouse gas emissions comes from land-use change, forest degradation, and deforestation.\n\nOfficials from both countries say it’s of mutual benefit to both countries, and to the world, to preserve Indonesia’s forests boost their capacity to sequester carbon from the atmosphere.\n\nUnder the new deal, payments still outstanding from the previous agreement, which was terminated in 2021, will be honored.\n\nJAKARTA — Indonesia has signed a new climate deal with Norway that will see the Nordic country pay the Southeast Asian one to keep its forests standing. The deal comes a year after Indonesia terminated a nearly identical scheme between the two countries over the lack of payments.\n\nLand-use change, forest degradation, and deforestation account for the bulk of Indonesia’s greenhouse gas emissions. The idea behind the new deal (and the previous one) is that by slowing or outright preventing forest loss, Indonesia will be able to preserve what’s currently the third-biggest expanse of tropical rainforest on Earth (behind the Amazon and the Congo Basin). Measurable progress on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, a mechanism known as REDD+, will then be eligible for payment under the deal with Norway.\n\nThe new partnership is enshrined in a memorandum of understanding signed by Indonesia’s minister of environment and forestry, Siti Nurbaya Bakar, and Norway’s minister of climate and environment, Espen Barth Eide, on Sept. 12.\n\nSiti said the intention to form a new partnership was conveyed by Norway in a letter dated Aug. 5.\n\n“Indonesia under the leadership of [President] Jokowi [Joko Widodo] has made great strides and I have to happily announce that we see Indonesia as a world leader on global issues that we’re discussing today,” Eide said. “It’s good for Indonesia, it’s good for Norway, it’s good for the planet because all of our efforts to reduce our emissions from energy, from the industry, from transport, would all be in vain if we don’t look after the carbon sink we already have.”\n\nRewarded for reducing emissions\n\nThe centerpiece of Indonesia’s forest policy is its “FOLU Net Sink 2030 Operational Plan,” an ambitious bid to transform its forests into a major carbon sink by 2030, absorbing 140 million metric tons more CO2 than they emit into the atmosphere.\n\nIndonesia has long been among the world’s top emitters of greenhouse gases from deforestation, forest fires and peatland destruction, but its deforestation rate has declined in recent years. According to official data, Indonesia’s deforestation rate in 2019/2020 was 115,500 hectares (285,400 acres), an almost 90% drop from 1.09 million hectares (2.69 million acres) in 2014/2015.\n\nThis progress came during the period when the previous agreement between Indonesia and Norway, signed in 2010, was still in place.\n\nIn 2019, Norway agreed to pay 530 million krone ($56 million) for Indonesia preventing the emission of 11.23 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) through REDD+ in 2017. But by 2021, Norway still hadn’t paid, prompting Indonesia to terminate the REDD+ agreement.\n\n“Indonesia and Norway had cooperation on environment, with REDD+ agreement in 2010, and it was very unfortunate [that] we cannot continue this cooperation,” Indonesia’s foreign minister, Retno Marsudi, said during a joint press conference with Norwegian officials in Jakarta on Sept. 12. “But we learned a lot from the REDD+ cooperation and continue to be constructive in our engagement.”\n\nBuilding on their long-standing partnership on environmental issues and past experiences, Norway and Indonesia have entered a new agreement, Eide said.\n\n“[We are] learning from our shared experience in the past and moving towards something that I think is really and genuinely promising,” he said at the press conference.\n\nBustar Maitar, CEO of Indonesian environmental NGO EcoNusa Foundation, said he’s optimistic the new climate partnership will further strengthen efforts to achieve the FOLU Net Sink target by 2030 and other climate actions.\n\nWhat to expect\n\nThe details of the new deal will be ironed out in a new contribution agreement, set to be signed in the next three to four weeks, Eide said.\n\n“And I would like to underline that this is just around the corner and that this is very promising work based on the MOU that we needed to sign in order to complete the contribution agreement,” he said.\n\nWhat’s clear, though, is that Norway’s International Climate and Forest Initiative (NICFI) will channel the payments directly to Indonesia’s Environment Fund. And the $56 million outstanding that Norway had agreed to pay Indonesia back in 2019 will be paid under the new partnership.\n\nEide said Norwegian payments for Indonesia’s REDD+ achievements made from 2016/2017 to 2019/2020 will be based on the existing measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) protocol, a system set up by Indonesia to account for its progress in reducing emissions.\n\nPayments for results generated from 2020/2021 onward will be based on a mutually agreed updated MRV protocol.\n\n“The first results-based contribution will amount to USD 56 million for verified emission reductions in the forest year” 2016/2017, or August 2016 through July 2017, Norway’s Ministry for Climate and Environment said in a press statement. “Additional results-based contributions will be [made] annually as emission reductions are verified for subsequent years.”\n\nThe new partnership differs in scope from the previous Indonesia-Norway REDD+ agreement, according to Indonesia’s environment minister Siti.\n\n“It is not just about the result-based contribution agreement, it encompasses a broader engagement on climate and forest issues in Indonesia,” she said at the press conference. “The MOU is also to emphasize the importance of deliverable, tangible and direct benefits for the community, and for the progress of Indonesia.”\n\nTo prevent this new deal from being abruptly terminated like the last one, it will be based on mutual respect and mutual understanding, complete with an MRV protocol that’s mutually agreed on by the two countries, said Dida Migfar Ridha, the head of foreign partnerships at Indonesia’s environment ministry.\n\n“This [partnership] is built together in accordance to Indonesia’s characteristics. For instance, we’re based on local community and Indigenous peoples, [and] we have internal regulations [on those issues],” he said on the sidelines of the press conference. “What’s most important is mutual trust and respect by paying attention to existing regulations, especially since [the new partnership] is carried out in Indonesia.”\n\nBanner image: Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae).

    "First in: The Sanubari hotel, Sumba, Indonesia hotel review": "The backstory\n\nFor the longest time, visiting Sumba either meant ponying up an eye-watering amount of rupiah for a stay at high-flyer hideaway Nihi, or roughing it at one of the basic homestays dotting the coast. Rowan and Micha Burn, the Bali-based British-Australian couple behind The Sanubari, saw an opportunity for a place pitched between these extremes. With the support of a duo of Bali-based British hoteliers, the family moved to Sumba five years ago to oversee the construction of the property, which opened in its first phase in July 2022. The couple has grand plans – and plenty of space – for future extensions, which include a residential villa project, horse stables, a locally minded creative village, and a farm to grow hard-to-source produce.\n\nThe Sanubari, Sumba, Indonesia Tommaso Riva\n\nThe rooms\n\nThe six roomy beachfront villas are all-white Sumbanese fantasies with sliding glass doors framing those stunning ocean views.

Bathrooms take up a third of the floor plan and come with open rain showers and soaking tubs overlooking the sea out front. Each villa (except for the Studio) also opens to its own beachfront infinity swimming pool, built from pebble-washed terrazzo that seemingly fades into the sand.

    "Indonesia’s electric vehicle batteries dream has a dirty nickel problem": "Indonesia—the world’s largest nickel miner—is making moves to become a key player in the electric vehicle supply chain. Most of Indonesia’s nickel output is currently Class 2 nickel, a low-purity type used for stainless steel. The country’s government and the mining sector are determined to transform its nickel industry to meet the rising demand for Class 1 nickel, a crucial component for electric vehicle (EV) batteries.[1] EVs are widely viewed as a pillar of the transition toward renewable energy sources since they typically have a smaller carbon footprint over their lifespan than gasoline-powered vehicles. These efforts have seen some success to date, with the EV and battery manufacturing sector making investments in the country’s downstream industry (in other words, investment in end-uses of nickel, such as EV batteries), including an EV battery cell plant near Jakarta.\n\nNickel is a key part of Indonesia’s commodity-led development strategy, in which the country has banned exports of raw commodities to attract downstream investment and catalyze socioeconomic development. The government is planning to tax exports of nickel pig iron (NPI) and ferronickel, which would likely boost production of battery-grade nickel. And for EV manufacturers struggling to source nickel in a tight market, Indonesia has become a key supplier in the past year.\n\nBut there is a catch: Indonesia’s nickel sector is particularly carbon-intensive and environmentally damaging. This creates an awkward challenge for EV manufacturers, who are under pressure to manage environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues in their supply chains, including carbon emissions. Some EV manufacturers have expressed a preference for “low-carbon” nickel. However, the supply of “low-carbon” is insufficient to meet forecasted demand, and it comes with a higher price tag. In this piece, we unpack the environmental risks and recent developments in Indonesia’s nickel industry that illustrate several of the difficult trade-offs required for decarbonization.\n\nEnvironmental concerns\n\nIndonesia’s nickel sector poses many environmental challenges. Its nickel processing industry is especially carbon-intensive due to its reliance on coal. Civil society groups have also voiced concerns about the environmental risks of nickel mining and processing. Most recently, environmental groups urged Tesla to terminate its investment plans in the country’s nickel industry, citing concerns over deforestation, pollution of water bodies, and disruption to the livelihoods of indigenous people as a result of nickel mining.\n\nThe way nickel is processed, and particularly how Indonesian nickel resources are transformed into material suited for EV batteries, is energy-intensive and environmentally damaging. On average, producing Class 1 nickel from Indonesia’s laterite ore resources, releases two to six times more the amount of carbon dioxide emissions than producing Class 1 nickel from sulfide deposits. The latter tend to have higher grades than laterite deposits and are easier to process, but more laterite projects in Indonesia and elsewhere are being developed to meet rising demand for nickel. Moreover, Indonesia’s energy grid remains highly reliant on coal—which accounts for approximately 60 percent of its total electricity capacity. Its industrial parks, which have become major hubs for nickel and aluminum processing, currently account for 15 percent of the country’s coal power output.\n\nIf plans to expand the captive power of these industrial parks are fulfilled, their share of Indonesia’s total coal power output is expected to rise to 24 percent. While Indonesia’s government technically has plans to phase out coal for electricity by 2056, it may not prove willing to make any economic tradeoffs, including reducing industrial park capacity.\n\nInitiatives by Tsingshan, the world’s largest nickel producer, highlight some of these environmental challenges. For example, Tsingshan is spearheading one of Indonesia’s five hydrometallurgy projects through PT Huayue, a joint venture that is using high-pressure acid leaching (HPAL) to produce Class 1 nickel from laterite resources, which are generally used for Class 2 nickel production. Even if in the long-term HPAL in Indonesia can be decarbonized, the process produces “toxic waste that is difficult to manage” and poses environmental risks, like many traditional metal smelters in Indonesia.\n\nSimilarly, Tsingshan has also converted Class 2 nickel pig iron (NPI), which is mainly used to produce stainless steel, into nickel matte, a higher-grade form of the material. This process has raised even greater concerns given that matte production from NPI results in nearly three times as many greenhouse gas emissions per unit of nickel as HPAL processing.\n\nInvestments and market dynamics\n\nThe government of Indonesia and investors jumping into the country’s nickel sector seem willing to overlook these environmental concerns. President Joko Widodo has expressed aspirations to develop an onshore nickel-based EV industry, including processing and refining, as well as producing battery components. In 2020, Indonesia banned raw nickel exports to develop a domestic downstream industry, which halted the large outflow of raw nickel to China.\n\nSince the export ban, Indonesia has seen an uptick in downstream investments focused on nickel refining and processing, especially from China. Chinese refineries, including GEM Co, have committed approximately $30 billion to offshore their activities to Indonesia. In mid-April 2022, Chinese battery giant CATL entered a joint investment in Indonesia for nickel mining and EV battery production.\n\nDownstream EV players, including Volkswagen and Tesla, have also aimed to secure minerals from the Southeast Asian nation. In April 2022, a Korean consortium led by LG Energy Solution, the world’s second-largest EV battery manufacturer, signed a $9 billion investment agreement with local mining company PT Aneka Tambang (Antam) and Indonesia Battery Corporation. LG Energy Solution is also building a $1.1 billion battery cell plant in Karawang Regency, 65 km southeast of Jakarta, as part of a joint venture with Hyundai Motor Group. China has played a key role in the financing of coal-fired power plants required for nickel processing. Indeed, China’s large-scale investment in Indonesia’s nickel industry raises serious questions about China’s own climate agenda. President Xi has announced broad plans to stop building coal plants overseas and halt new coal-related projects. Indonesian coal-powered nickel processing plants seem to be an exception. A report by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air explains that China may be using a loophole to develop two nickel and steel processing plants powered by coal plants in Indonesia. The projects fall under a gray area, as they are not “new.” Rather, they are linked to existing steel and nickel complexes approved before the ban. As a result, the coal-fired power plants have secured construction and purchasing agreements from Chinese firms.\n\nMoreover, it would be difficult for EV manufacturers to cut Indonesian nickel out of their supply chains even if they wanted to. Russia supplies roughly 20 percent of Class 1 nickel, but the repercussions of its invasion of Ukraine and the potential for sanctions may reduce this and constrain European and U.S. actors’ willingness or ability to source nickel from Russia. Given the investments into Indonesia’s refining and processing capacity and the sheer amount of its nickel reserves, Indonesia will likely become an even more important source of refined nickel for EV batteries over the next decade.\n\nMoving forward\n\nGovernment action will be vital to cutting carbon emissions in the nickel supply chain. There are some encouraging moves in Europe. For example, the new EU Batteries Regulation will require EV battery manufacturers to disclose the carbon footprint of all batteries sold in Europe. While manufacturers may be motivated to reduce the carbon footprint of their batteries, including by opting for lower-carbon nickel, they will also likely face practical constraints due to a supply squeeze. Moreover, there is little sign of action when it comes to cutting carbon emissions in the nickel supply chain from other major players like China and the U.S.\n\nIf the industry and policymakers ignore the climate threats of coal-powered industrial parks used to produce substances like nickel, Indonesia could solidify its standing as one of the world’s largest but dirtiest nickel players in the EV supply chain.\n\nFootnotes:\n\n[1] According to the IEA, “There are two types of primary nickel products: high-purity Class 1 products (containing 99.8% nickel or above) and lower-purity Class 2 products (containing less than 99.8% nickel). Battery cathodes need nickel sulfate, which is synthesized from Class 1 products.”",

It is doubtless the most ambitious attempt to present a holistic view of the island since Fred Eiseman, Jr.’s Bali: Sekala and Niskala (1990), or Adrian Vickers’ Bali: A Paradise Created (1989). Yet this is not a historical narrative, or the culmination of years of comprehensive research on a particular topic. Instead we find a series of transcribed conversations between two expatriates: Buvelot, a journalist based on the island since 1995, and Couteau, a renowned writer, social observer and commentator intimately involved with Bali since the 1970s.\n\nAdopting an interview format, Buvelot draws on Couteau’s lived experiences and decades of interaction with Balinese of all backgrounds and other Indonesians to weave some 20 hours of dialogue into a composite contemporary portrait. Central topics of the book’s 16 chapters are loosely organised according to the originally-Indian philosophical principles of kama (desire), arta (wealth), darma (duty) and moksa (liberation). The two men interact on the page as observers, provocateurs and debaters, each reflecting his position as insider-outsider; ‘we are part of the sociological object that we analyse,’ Buvelot writes.\n\nThe resulting dialectic is penetrating and wide-ranging, with many unresolved questions and contradictions, reflecting not only the dynamism of systemic change, but also the variable, inconsistent and inherently particularist configuration of Balinese life in general. Couteau sees power as always negotiated, configured through multiple associations and social ties. While provincial (or previously, royal) authority might seek to decree practices of land use or ritual, say, it is ultimately a local village decision that prevails. Centralised power is always in contest with the local, and what is local the Balinese explain as a matter of differences, of desa, kala, patra –place, time, and pattern. Couteau posits this kind of predictable indeterminacy as a fundamental strength, stemming from Bali’s heritage of ancestor worship underlying religion and social life. The ancestors are local, reborn into specific individuals and locations, nurturing and constraining Balinese mutual obligation and community belonging.\n\nDefining an audience for the book is a puzzle, as it targets neither the novice, the traveller or the scholar and expatriate residents of Bali are a narrow market. Nonetheless, the sweep of its subject matter may draw even the casual reader into topics such as personal morality, environmental pollution, racism, and reincarnation. The rhetorical frame with its four themes is not always successful: topics (for example, sex, education, urbanisation, the violence of 1965) are often discussed in one chapter, then reappear in another, and there is no subject index to guide the reader. Topics ebb and flow through multiple perspectives, circling around to illuminate yet another aspect of something already mentioned under a different heading. This initially feels frustrating, yet while reading the book I was reminded of the intricate layering and cyclical structure of gamelan music, which builds texture through repetition, marked at regular intervals by the recurrent, familiar sound of the gong.\n\nA Balinese family perform a ritual, Ubud /wikimedia commons\n\nCouteau’s responses to Buvelot’s queries evoke major shifts in Balinese systems, lifestyles and cultural patterns that are both encouraging and troubling. Bali depends on its globally-marketed image of green, fertile ricefields, yet today’s society is post-agrarian, as many land holdings have been sold to build roads, shopping centres and resorts, and thousands have moved from the village to urban lifeworlds. Disappearing vistas and water-borne plastic have marred the image of a pristine nature. While being part of Indonesia has fostered tolerance of different identities (including the foreign), brought universal schooling and modern infrastructure, not to mention investment in a dynamic tourist economy, it has also led to the arrival of economic migrants—sex workers, wage labor—from different, poorer places, with resulting ethnic tensions and competition. Even with widespread literacy and enhanced prosperity, patriarchy and polygamy persistently disadvantage Balinese women; new norms regarding gender and sexuality are flaunted in the tourist districts but resisted back in the villages.\n\nBalinese readers, especially, might be uncomfortable with some of the harsher glimpses behind the carefully groomed image of their ‘island of the gods’, as Couteau deals with rape, gigolos and the sexual freedom enabled by motorcycles; disappearance of the natural and architectural heritage; and patterns of violence and public corruption, all part of today’s Bali. Buvelot and Couteau could have included more commentary on the emergence of artists, civic action, social media and NGOs producing counter-narratives to the idealised images of a tourist paradise; while they mention the controversial development project at Benoa, they never quite explain reklamasi and the reasons it has prompted widespread opposition.\n\nIt is in the realm of religion, Couteau suggests, that Bali’s fundamental core is being most strongly challenged. Religion used to focus on the ancestral obligations and ritual inherent to families and clans, with an overlay of court-centered ceremony celebrating Hindu and Buddhist deities, Kawi texts and Javanese-Majapahit lore. Now, a growing number of Balinese see themselves as part of ‘the great global family of Hindus’, rationalising doctrine and standardising temple ceremony under a top-down authority, the Council of Hindu Affairs (Parisada Hindu Darma). This normative thinking encourages many Balinese to define themselves as Hindu in a new way—adopting Sanskritised neologisms and making pilgrimage to sacred sites in India, among other practices. Couteau argues that as ethno-religious identity comes to dominate self-awareness, it becomes difficult for Balinese to take a critical stance on their society; if managing the image of ‘Bali for the World’ becomes everyone’s obligation, objectivity and reason are lost. Ultimately, he hopes that the primal and deeply rooted village systems, imbued with the cult of the ancestors, will anchor Balinese identity no matter how strong the winds of change.\n\nTwo special features of this book deserve highlighting. One is the insightful foreword written by the Balinese author Kadek Krishna Adidharma, welcoming the two men examining ‘our idiosyncrasies and contradictions’ and acknowledging that although ‘a tradition-bound Balinese could never have published the observations in this book,’ its appearance might open new kinds of discussion. The graceful flow of the translation (from the original French) created by Diana Darling is a notable achievement.\n\nRendering hours of transcribed conversation into an organised text is not an easy task, and Buvelot has shaped chapter headings and introductions as guideposts making the reader’s journey through the material more manageable. Even more helpful would be a unified glossary of terminology and references, as the text tends to be cluttered by redundant footnotes, along with definitions of terms that would be more efficiently compiled in one place. Both text editing and proofreading functions seem to have gotten short shrift in the production process; these could both be improved in a subsequent edition. The interviews published here seem to have been completed before the appearance of COVID-19, suggesting that pandemic-related impacts and changes in Bali still await further interpretation. One hopes these two interlocutors do not end their deep explorations of what it means to be Balinese, and to be observing Bali, at the 50-year mark. They have much more to reflect upon, and to share with us.\n\nEric Buvelot, Bali, 50 Years of Changes: A Conversation with Jean Couteau. Trans.

    "Indonesia’s criminal code a step backwards, not forwards": "After two years of pandemic killjoy, Indonesia’s Independence Day celebrations last month had a festive feel. During a ceremony at Merdeka Palace in Jakarta, the public was entertained by the rare spectacle of President Joko Widodo’s cabinet ministers dancing to a dangdut rendition sung by recent online sensation 12-year-old Fadel Prayoga. High-ranking political figures, from Finance Minister Sri Mulyani to Defence Minister and two-time presidential rival Prabowo Subianto (who recently announced he’s going to run for office again in 2024), all got up from their seats to jive, albeit a bit awkwardly.\n\nBut the festivity could easily have involved a sour note.\n\nThe original plan had also been to celebrate by ratifying the country’s new criminal code on 17 August as “a gift” to the nation in a move that may well have incited widespread protests. Back in 2019, the government had been ready to make the code official before student activists and a coalition of non-governmental organisations flooded the streets in what became Indonesia’s largest pro-democracy movement in more than two decades. The prospect of civil unrest back then was successful in forcing lawmakers to postpone the code’s ratification – only for them to pick up where they left off three years later.\n\nSome provisions in the proposed criminal code seem to define unlawful acts through a conservative-religious lens.\n\nPublic animosity towards the bill is largely due to a perception that the code will carry negative consequences, including opening the way to prosecute actions that should not be treated as a criminal offence (such as a fine of up to IDR 1 million for homeless people who disturb public order). It will allow criminalisation based on very loosely defined provisions, such as violating “Living Laws” that are yet to be codified by the state but implemented by the local community. The National Alliance for Criminal Code Reform compiled 24 problems still unresolved within the current draft, warning that its implementation might exacerbate Indonesia’s prison overcrowding problem.\n\nSome provisions in the proposed criminal code seem to define unlawful acts through a conservative-religious lens, such as clauses that enable parents, spouses and children to report family members to the police for conducting sex and cohabitation outside of marriage. The reform alliance argues that this mechanism will likely exacerbate the rate of child marriage in the country, as it provides the nudge for parents to prevent their children from committing adultery. Another clause will prohibit people outside medical professionals from publicly demonstrating the use of contraceptive devices, completely ignoring national and global health goals in preventing the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nPolice take cover during a 2019 rally in Jakarta against the proposed criminal code in front of the People’s Representative Council (Oscar Siagian/Getty Images)\n\nIf Joko Widodo’s administration is often described as narrowly focused on economic growth, it is peculiar that it failed to see how these provisions will be detrimental to Indonesia’s development agenda. Child marriage is estimated to cost around 1.7 per cent of Indonesia’s GDP as it conditions young people, especially girls, to cease their education early, which prevents them obtaining the required skills to participate in the job market.\n\nMeanwhile, the annual expenditure for HIV/AIDS in Indonesia has previously reached more than US$100 million, resulting in a large cost to the public purse.\n\nIf the provisions in the draft criminal code make no sense from a development standpoint, this conservative turn could instead be seen as efforts to cater to political Islam influences in hopes of attaining national stability. Andreas Harsono of Human Rights Watch claims that Islamists consider the draft criminal code to be the “crown jewel” of their protracted efforts to exert the influence of Sharia law in Indonesia. After years of antagonistic relations with the Islamic populist coalition, the government sought to dismantle the social base of its opposition by disbanding two large Islamic groups, Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia and the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) for conducting “anti-nationalist activities”. If this political ban amounts to a stick approach, the draft criminal code appears to be the carrot of positive reinforcement, showing that the government is nonetheless willing to cater to their religious socio-cultural aspirations – provided that they don’t themselves pose a political threat.\n\nOther, more repressive clauses in the criminal code include reviving anti-defamation provisions against the president, vice president and government. These were remnants of the colonial lèse-majesté law that sought to protect the sovereignty of the Dutch monarchy and had previously been annulled by the Constitutional Court during Indonesia’s period of democratisation in the 2000s. The code also contains a rubbery provision criminalising public acts of protest deemed to “disturb public order” or other collective acts of protest without a permit from the local police.\n\nThis preoccupation with stability implies that Indonesia’s political landscape is moving towards post-populism, a bid to resolve the disastrous social effects brought about by polarisation amongst nationalist and religious factions. At a basic level, the shift signifies that the government is aware that its technocratic agenda can only be achieved by a degree of democratic consolidation among the otherwise perpetually conflicting elites – even if this harmonisation can only be achieved through mechanisms that largely foreclose the possibility of political opposition.\n\nAs Indonesia prepares to host the G20 leaders’ summit in November, the draft code will probably be ratified some time before the event to forestall any major protests, with it to be made official afterwards. For Indonesia’s democratic civil alliance, the next two months will be crucial for negotiations to ensure the bill respects principles of human rights, as well as align it to the administration’s own development goals.",
    "Fuel price hike sparks protests in Indonesia": "Last week, mass protests erupted across Indonesia after the government of President Joko Widodo announced price hikes that will result in the cost of subsidised fuel surging by over 30 percent. That is the first government ordered petrol price increase in eight years. Rallies and demonstrations are continuing.\n\nStudent activists shout slogans after knocking down police barricade during a rally against sharp increases in fuel prices, in Jakarta, Indonesia, Thursday, Sept. 8, 2022. [AP Photo/Achmad Ibrahim]\n\nThe decision, announced on 3 September, was taken amid a global inflationary spiral that has sent the prices of essential commodities in Indonesia skyrocketing. This year, the costs of cooking oil, electricity, and multiple food staples have soared as a result of the massive infusion of government funds into the stockmarkets, the US-NATO proxy war against Russia in Ukraine war and the disruptions stemming from the “let it rip” COVID-19 program.\n\nPresident Widodo said in a televised address that the hike was the “last option,” due to a ballooning energy subsidy budget caused by rising global oil and gas prices.\n\nWidodo’s initial announcement immediately sparked spontaneous rallies, involving workers and students who burned tyres and blocked roads. On September 5, the Indonesian Trade Union Confederation (KSPI) then stepped in, holding its own organised protests.\n\nThe KSPI called on the government to reverse the price hike and lift the minimum wage by 10 to 13 percent before next year.\n\nThe September 5 rallies involved tens of thousands of workers and students across the country in the cities of Jakarta, Surabaya, Makassar, Kendari, Aceh, Yogyakarta, Bandung, Medan and Semarang. Demonstrations were planned in a total of 34 provinces, union leaders told Tempo magazine, including in rural areas outside the offices of provincial governors and local officials.\n\nIn the capital city Jakarta, an estimated 5,000 industrial workers marched and chanted slogans outside Parliament, denouncing the government’s move and demanding higher wages. The protest was also attended by teachers, domestic workers, farmers and fishermen, as well as hundreds of university students.\n\nIn Makassar, a major city on the island of Sulawesi, student protesters raised that the price increase would especially burden workers who have not fully recovered from being infected with COVID-19.\n\nAhead of the rallies, a massive police presence was established across the archipelago. In Jakarta, around 7,200 police and military personnel were deployed in and around the capital, with the largest concentration of forces near Parliament and petrol stations. Roads leading to the Presidential Palace were blocked.\n\nPrice hikes in fuel and other basic commodities were the initial trigger for the mass protests in 1998 which toppled the Suharto dictatorship amid the South East Asia economic crisis. The last fuel price increase in 2014, just months after Widodo first assumed office, set off a wave of protests around the country.\n\nThe social conditions in Indonesia today are even more explosive. The pandemic, allowed by the Widodo government to rip through the country with minimal health measures in place, has wrought enormous physical and economic devastation on the Indonesian working class and rural masses.\n\nThe official pandemic statistics, 6 million cases and 150,000 deaths, are acknowledged by medical experts to be a vast undercount, the result of a chronically low testing regime and a large number of unreported deaths. The government’s criminal pro-business program of “reopening” amid the pandemic led to the horrific mass death caused by the Delta wave in July 2021, with over 2,000 official daily deaths at its peak and thousands more dying at home.\n\nThe massive corporate bailouts and injection of money into the financial markets worldwide has precipitated the inflation crisis, which the Indonesian government is seeking to resolve by austerity and further inroads into workers’ living conditions.\n\nThe fuel hike has raised the price of gasoline from about 51 cents to 67 cents per litre and diesel fuel from 35 cents to 46 cents. As subsidised fuel accounts for more than 80 percent of state-owned oil giant Pertamina’s sales, the price increase will have a major impact on workers’ families and small businesses, and is predicted to elevate food and energy costs.\n\nAnother protest last Thursday involved more violent clashes between demonstrators and police. Students gathering at Jakarta’s National Monument burned tyres and dismantled razor wire barricades erected by authorities. Footage released on social media showed riot police firing on student protesters with water cannon. Elsewhere in the city, protesters attempted to block the vice president’s motorcade, causing the convoy to quickly flee.\n\nThe unions have indicated rallies will continue until December and have said that they are considering a national strike. Said Iqbal, president of the KSPI, addressed the workers’ rally outside Parliament on Tuesday last week: “We have won before and we are confident that President Joko Widodo will hear the people’s voices alongside the voices of the elites who do not care about the interests of the common people.”\n\nThe KSPI, one of Indonesia’s peak union groups, has a long record of organising carefully coordinated one-day rallies outside government buildings, designed to allow workers to blow off steam and prevent a major social explosion. It has played a critical role in diffusing workers’ struggles over recent years amid growing opposition among workers to the Widodo government’s assault on their rights and conditions.\n\nIn November 2021, the KSPI held similar rallies in response to price rises of up to 10 percent for basic commodities. Workers also wanted to fight against the government’s anti-worker Omnibus Law, passed in 2020, which has allowed the financial elite to slash wages, job protections and further enrich big business. The KSPI’s demands for a minimum wage rise fell on deaf ears.\n\nIn 2019, protests of workers emerged after the government passed legislation weakening the official anti-corruption body. The KSPI declared that it would work “as a team” with the Widodo government and boasted of its backing for pro-business measures to “build a good investment climate.”\n\nThe unions, moreover, are an active participant in the sordid intrigues of official politics. During the 2019 presidential elections, the KSPI endorsed Widodo’s far-right opponent, Prabowo Subianto, a former general under Suharto. After Widodo’s victory, union leaders quickly pledged their fealty to the president.\n\nThis union is not planning to defend the “interests of the common people” before the “elites,” as Iqbal claimed. Instead, the KSPI is seeking to direct the mounting social anger back into the safe channels of feckless appeals to the Indonesian ruling class as it proceeds with its austerity program.\n\nYesterday, government ministers declared that they would “consider” some of the union’s demands. This is a clear sop to the union bureaucracy aimed at assisting it to end the protests without any change to workers’ conditions.\n\nAs is the case internationally, the soaring costs in Indonesia demonstrate that workers there are in a struggle against the capitalist system, which subordinates social needs to the profit interests of the major corporations. This poses the need for a break with the entire political establishment and a turn to a socialist perspective."
