This month, Canada authorised Moderna Inc’s bivalent COVID-19 shots for adults, the country’s first Omicron-adapted vaccine.\n\n“Thanks largely to Canadians who have rolled up their sleeves to get vaccinated, we have reached the point where we can safely lift the sanitary measures at the border,” Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos said.\n\nDuclos said the government was prepared to reinstate restrictions if needed.\n\n“Obviously we have no hope to reintroduce some of these measures but if we need to protect the safety of Canadians, we will have to,” he told reporters in Ottawa.\n\nTravellers, regardless of citizenship, will not have to submit health information through the ArriveCAN app or provide proof of vaccination from Saturday.\n\nA requirement for travellers to wear masks on planes and trains would also be dropped. Cruise ship passengers and crew would also no longer be subject to vaccine requirements or COVID-19 testing.",

    "Opals beat Canada, into WC knockout stage": "Standout performances from Sami Whitcomb and Ezi Magbegor have helped Australia to a 75-72 win over previously undefeated Canada that ensures the Opals will advance to the knockout stage at the women's basketball World Cup.\n\nThe victory at Qudos Bank Arena improved Australia's record to 3-1, meaning they are on track to finish in the top two of Group B and dodge a quarter-final meeting with red-hot tournament favourites the USA.\n\n\"We found our resolve and our grit, to find a way to win I think says a lot about these girls,\" Opals coach Sandy Brondello said.\n\nBec Allen sat the game out after suffering a rib injury in the Opals' win over Serbia and her absence was felt early as Australia struggled to stick with the sharp-shooting Canadians.\n\nA verbal exchange between Australia's Kristy Wallace and Canadian captain Natalie Achonwa proved the impetus for a 19-0 surge that helped the Opals turn a 14-point deficit into a five-point lead in the second quarter.\n\nWallace appeared to accuse Achonwa of playing for a foul and the Canadian fired back at her before sinking her two free throws.\n\nThey were to be Canada's only points for the rest of the half as Australia increased their defensive pressure and racked up eight unanswered points to force a timeout.\n\nAfter a quiet start to the tournament, Magbegor was the chief beneficiary of the Opals' momentum, netting eight of the side's 24 second-quarter points to help snatch the lead at the main change.\n\nShe was just as pivotal in defence.\n\nMagbegor led all comers for blocks (five), one of which came in the final seconds as Canada threatened to steal the match back.\n\n\"Going into this game we knew it was going to be a tough one,\" Magbegor told reporters.\n\n\"I think we're getting better as each game goes.\"\n\nIn the third quarter, turnovers cost the Opals and Bridget Carleton (16 points) inspired Canada to mount a fightback.\n\nBoth sides turned to desperate measures late in the term, conceding unsportsmanlike fouls in the final 90 seconds, but it was Canada who took a six-point lead into the final change.\n\nWhitcomb and Steph Talbot played 34 and 36 minutes, respectively, with the former the Opals' X-factor late in the game, and the latter their defensive anchor.\n\nPunching her fist to the crowd and forcing a Canadian timeout, Whitcomb drew the scores level with a three-pointer.\n\nShe then came up with a steal that allowed Talbot to storm through the paint and shortly thereafter drained another three-pointer to help the Opals tighten the screws.\n\nThe New York Liberty guard finished with 15 points - nine in the final quarter - while Talbot sunk two free throws in the final 30 seconds that had her closing in on a triple double with 11 points, nine rebounds and eight assists.\n\n\"Both of those players were critical for us,\" Brondello said of Whitcomb and Talbot.\n\nEarlier, the USA kept their unbeaten run alive and posted a record for most points in a World Cup game by thrashing South Korea 145-69.\n\nChina, France and Belgium all posted wins that confirmed they would also advance to the quarter-finals of the tournament, while Mali and Bosnia & Herzegovina both lost their fourth straight games and cannot advance beyond the group stage.\n\nAustralia's defeat of Canada also ruled reigning Olympic Silver medallists Japan out of the quarter-finals with one day remaining in the group stage.",

The revised questionnaire continues to give applicants the opportunity and flexibility to highlight their accomplishments and experiences in their responses, including how they live and interact with their local and broader communities, and how their experiences have shaped them.\n\nThe revisions reflect a more streamlined approach while maintaining a robust and thorough assessment of candidates. Among the revisions, the questionnaire has been updated to incorporate more respectful and inclusive language for individuals to self-identify diversity characteristics.\n\nThe revised questionnaire will continue to provide Judicial Advisory Committees (JACs) with vital information to guide their recommendations. JAC members assess candidates’ professional competence and overall merit, as well as identify any unique experiences or challenges that shaped candidates in their lives and careers. JACs are encouraged to strive to create a pool of candidates that is gender-balanced and reflective of Canada’s diversity.\n\nThe judicial application process emphasizes transparency, merit, and the diversity of the Canadian population, and continues to ensure the appointment of jurists who meet the highest standards of excellence and integrity.",
    "Canada strengthens protections for temporary foreign workers as new regulations come into force": "September 26, 2022 Gatineau, Quebec Employment and Social Development Canada\n\nThe Government of Canada takes its responsibilities to protect temporary foreign workers (TFWs) very seriously. Ensuring the health and safety of these workers while they are in Canada is a key priority, and the Government is taking concrete action to better support them.\n\nToday, Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion Carla Qualtrough and Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship (IRCC) Sean Fraser announced that new amendments to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (Temporary Foreign Workers) are now in force. These 13 new regulatory amendments include measures to strengthen protections for TFWs and will enhance the integrity of the TFW Program and the International Mobility Program (IMP), administered by IRCC.\n\nThe new regulations will better protect TFWs and help to prevent mistreatment and abuse during their stay in Canada by:\n\nmandating that employers provide all TFWs with information about their rights in Canada;\n\nprohibiting reprisal by employers against workers, for instance against those who come forward with complaints; and,\n\nprohibiting employers from charging recruitment fees to workers and holding them accountable for the actions of recruiters in this regard.\n\nIn addition, employers are now required to provide reasonable access to health care services. Employers using the TFW Program, are also required to provide private health insurance when needed.\n\nThese regulations will deter bad actors from participating in the program, and will improve the program’s ability to conduct inspections and administer appropriate consequences for those who do not follow the rules. Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) can also suspend the processing of any new Labour Market Impact Assessments (LMIAs) if there is reason to suspect that an employer’s non-compliance with the new conditions would put a foreign worker’s health or safety at serious risk.\n\nOverall, these new regulations will ensure greater transparency and clarity on the requirements and conditions of the TFW Program and IMP. Employers will be more aware of their responsibilities and program rules, which will lead to better protection of workers and increased program compliance.\n\nThese measures complement other worker protection initiatives already underway. For example, in July 2022, Minister Qualtrough convened the inaugural TFW Program Ministerial Consultative Roundtable. This meeting focused on accommodations and was the first of several meetings expected to take place over the next three years to seek input directly from stakeholders on how to make the TFW Program stronger and more effective for workers, employers and their communities.\n\nESDC also continues to improve the TFW compliance regime while implementing improvements to help better protect TFWs, including:\n\nenhancing inspection tools and mandatory training to strengthen the quality and timeliness of inspections;\n\ncontinuing to leverage an enhanced tip line service including live agents, allowing workers to flag any situation of abuse or misuse of the program in a confidential manner;\n\ncontinuing to raise employers’ awareness of their obligations to foster compliance with the TFW Program’s conditions; and,\n\nexpanding collaboration with consulates, as well as provinces and local authorities, to help the Department to identify concerns that need immediate attention and take action.",
    "Today’s crises highlight need for more multilateralism, stronger UN, says Canada’s Foreign Minister": "“These crises and the way we choose to respond to them are testing our shared commitment to the United Nations. That’s why our decisions matter now more than ever,” Canada’s Foreign Minister, Mélanie Joly, told the General Assembly’s annual high-level debate on Monday.\n\n‘More multilateralism, not less’\n\n“We have a choice – either we respect and defend the rules that we collectively have developed for generations and that have given us the longest period of peace in modern history or we accept that rules can be broken by the powerful, bringing us back to darker times of constant tensions and conflicts, with massive displacements, suffering and losses of human lives.\n\n“For Canada, the choice is clear: we’re convinced that we need more multilateralism, not less; we need more of the UN, not less; and we need a UN that is effective, efficient, relevant and accountable.”\n\nOn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Ms. Joly said the 193-member General Assembly has spoken clearly and with conviction.\n\n“Russia’s aggressions against Ukraine violate the UN Charter. It strikes at the heart of the commitment we all made in building this Organization from the dark tragedy of the Second World War. Rather than follow this Assembly’s decisions and a legally-binding order from the International Court of Justice, Russia had doubled down, including with a desperate effort to justify the unjustifiable.”\n\nNoting that while the world gathered in New York, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russia will conscript more young people to the war.\n\n“For Putin, this is a war to the death; for Ukraine, it is a war for life,” Ms. Joly stated.\n\nThe impacts of this “illegal” war are profoundly felt around the world, she continued. “We must address the global food security crisis and other consequences of the illegal invasion with imagination and determination.\n\n“And those who break the law must be met with the force of the law. A permanent seat on the Security Council not a license to kill nor to silence anyone, and it should never guarantee impunity.”\n\nNo country left behind’\n\nTurning to other major challenges, Ms. Joly highlighted the need to redouble efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, and to reforming the international financial institutions to enable them to adapt to today’s crises.\n\n“No country must be left behind,” she stressed, adding that Canada is working with partners for just and equitable reform of the international financial system, which is crucial for equity and for global peace and stability.\n\nCanada, she went on, is committed to ending the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as tackling HIV, tuberculosis and malaria. Last week, Prime Minister Trudeau committed to investing $1.2 billion in these efforts.;\n\n‘More urgency on climate’\n\nOn climate change, Ms. Joly said the world must act with the same urgency as during the COVID pandemic.\n\n“From the Arctic to the small island States, climate change is an existential threat, and we are feeling its effects every day,” she said. “Canada has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by 2030 and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, and we have a credible plan to do so.”\n\nThere are no simple solutions to the challenges the world is facing, she noted. “But it is clear that to isolate ourselves, to disregard the rule of law and to force people into silence runs counter to progress. And yet, certain countries are restricting civil liberties, violating human rights and conducting widespread surveillance of their population.\n\n“This trend towards authoritarianism is extremely worrying,” she stated, drawing particular attention to the Xinjiang region of China.\n\nOn human rights, no ‘defending the indefensible’\n\nLikewise, Canada is concerned about the repression of human rights seen in several countries. “We know that human rights are universal by nature. Therefore, we cannot hide behind the pretext of national sovereignty to violate them; there are limits to defending the indefensible.”\n\nMs. Joly also stressed the equality of women and girls as crucial for peace, justice and prosperity. Canada will repel increasing attacks on the rights and freedoms of women – from Afghanistan, where the Taliban are preventing women and girls from going to school, to Myanmar, where the women who are openly calling for a return to democracy are imprisoned by the military junta, tortured and subjected to “horrific” acts of sexual violence.\n\n“In Iran,” she continued, “women protesting the death of Mahsa Amini are met with arrests and bullets. We salute their courage and join them in sending a strong message that women’s rights are human rights.\n\n“Today, Prime Minister Trudeau announced that Canada will sanction those responsible, including Iran’s so-called morality police and its leadership.”",
    "Canada invests in green upgrades to health and wellness centre in Tsuut’ina Nation": "Today, the Honourable Randy Boissonnault, Minister of Tourism and Associate Minister of Finance, on behalf of the Honourable Dominic LeBlanc, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Infrastructure and Communities and Roy Whitney, Xakiji (Chief), Tsuut’ina Nation, announced more than $1.9 million in federal funding to support green infrastructure upgrades for a community health and wellness facility in Tsuut’ina Nation.\n\nThe Tsuut’ina Nation Community Drop-In Centre for Healthy Living, also known as the Spirit Healing Lodge, has played an important role in the Tsuut’ina Nation community for over 30 years. The facility is a place where Nation members can go to access a wide range of services and resources, including support for mental health, addiction, trauma, and domestic and socioeconomic issues.\n\n“Our Government is committed to working together with First Nations, Inuit and Métis people to build a brighter and greener future in Alberta and across Canada. Investing in projects that improve community resources is an integral part of that mission. This project will see necessary upgrades brought to a cornerstone of Tsuut’ina Nation and allow the building to serve the community for years to come,” said the Honourable Randy Boissonnault, Minister of Tourism and Associate Minister of Finance, on behalf of the Honourable Dominic LeBlanc, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Infrastructure and Communities.\n\n“Tsuut’ina is making steady strides towards cultural preservation and the celebration of our history. Central to those efforts are facilities like museums, our schools and of course our drop in and healing centre. Intergeneration trauma is real, but can be overcome, with time, through our collective commitment to nurturing our community members. The federal contribution to this centre is as important as it welcomed, and represents a step forward on the path to reconciliation,” said Roy Whitney, Xakiji (Chief), Tsuut’ina Nation.\n\nBy investing in infrastructure, the Government of Canada is growing our country’s economy, increasing the resiliency of our communities, and improving the lives of Canadians.\n\nThe funding announced today will improve the building’s efficiency by upgrading the heating system, boilers, lighting, commercial kitchen equipment, and windows and doors. Additional green upgrades will include the installation of solar panels and re-grading and landscaping to improve the Lodge’s drainage and climate resiliency. Federal funding will also support accessibility enhancements, like the construction of new concrete sidewalks with ramps for wheelchair access.\n\nThe green and accessibility upgrades to the Tsuut’ina Nation Community Drop-In Centre for Healthy Living will provide essential services and resources to the community of the Tsuut’ina Nation, while extending the longevity of the existing building and ensuring that the environmentally conscious improvements help further Canada along its path towards a greener future.",

The construction of this new Kêts’ádań Kù in Burwash Landing will better serve children and families in the community for years to come.\n\nBy investing in rural, remote and northern infrastructure, the Government of Canada is growing our country’s economy, increasing the resiliency of our communities, and improving the lives of Canadians.\n\nThe Government of Canada is investing up to a maximum of $10,875,000, and the Government of Yukon will be contributing at least $11.7 million to match Canada’s investment.",
    "Sudden die-off of endangered sturgeon alarms Canadian biologists": "When the first spindly, armour-clad carcass was spotted in the fast-flowing Nechako River in early September, Nikolaus Gantner and two colleagues scrambled out on a jet boat, braving strong currents to investigate the grim discovery.\n\nDays later, the remains of 10 others were spotted floating along a 100km stretch of the river in western Canada.\n\nIn total, 11 endangered white sturgeon have mysteriously died in a short period of time, blindsiding biologists, who are trying to save a fish teetering towards extinction.\n\nThe species has remained relatively unchanged in 200m years: toothless apex hunters that glide gracefully in a handful of British Columbia’s rivers. To navigate the murky waters, sturgeon gently brush whisker-like barbels that hang from their snout along the gravelly bottom.\n\nWhite sturgeon, with a torso clad in five distinct bony plates called scutes, look every inch a prehistoric fish. The largest ever recorded reached 20ft long and another, believed to be 104 years old, weighed nearly 1,800 lbs.\n\nThe Nechako River, where the sturgeon population has dropped from 5,000 to 500 in the past century. Photograph: Fernando Lessa/Alamy\n\n“When you see a massive head appearing through the murky water and the eyes look at you, it’s just incredible to see this majestic animal alive,” said Gantner, a senior fisheries biologist with the British Columbia government. “And you gain respect for it, knowing that most fish we see are older than us.”\n\nThe rapid succession of deaths has taken an unexpected emotional toll on Gantner and his colleagues.\n\n“I’m deeply saddened. These last couple of weeks, I feel like I’m going through grief,” he said. Each time he and colleagues tenderly move the hulking carcasses of the fish from the shore to the freezer and on to the necropsy table, he feels a pang of sorrow. “I don’t think I felt like that from other fish that I’ve worked with.”\n\nSo far, there are no obvious answers. The team hasn’t found any sign of trauma nor evidence of chemical exposure, disease, or angling-induced death.\n\n“Whatever it is, it affects larger sturgeon, not other species. It’s constrained to a place in time and space. So that gives us some clues,” said Steve McAdam, a biologist with the province’s ministry of land, water and resource stewardship. “In a way, it’s easier to rule a bunch of stuff out than to rule some things in.”\n\nThe deaths in the Nechako are particularly painful for McAdam, who studied a similar die-off in the lower Fraser River in 1993 and 1994, when the region lost 36 fish in two years.\n\nA battery of tests that followed that die-off was inconclusive, said McAdam; the events occurred in differing ecosystems, hundreds of kilometres apart, offering limited clues to investigators.\n\nBecause the team investigating the current episode has a narrow window of time to recover dead sturgeon before decomposition sets in and destroys valuable clues, they have appealed to the public for help. In a region where the fish have deep cultural ties to First Nations and are part of the curriculum in local schools, residents have paid close attention to the phenomenon.\n\nA range of theories have been suggested, including a belief that elevated water temperatures are to blame. But McAdam said previous hot summers had not triggered similar die-offs.\n\n“There’s no end to the ideas. There are some partial explanations, but we’re really trying to keep an open mind and not veer too far down one path,” he said.\n\nTo navigate in murky waters, sturgeon gently brush whisker-like barbels that hang from their snouts along the gravelly bottom. Photograph: Minden Pictures/Alamy\n\nBefore the mysterious die-offs, white sturgeon, which are listed as a federal species at risk, were already in trouble.\n\nOver the last century, the numbers in the Nechako River have dropped from more than 5,000 to only 500. Soon after a dam was built on the Nechako River in 1957, the species experienced what biologists call “recruitment failure” – new fish weren’t being added to the population.\n\nIt is from within that ageing population, already missing an entire generation of fish, that the 11 have died.\n\nOverfishing, drainage projects and dam construction have all contributed to the collapse. On all the rivers in the province where sturgeon once thrived, dams have crushed their populations. Only the Fraser River, the largest without a dam, has a relatively healthy sturgeon population in the tens of thousands.\n\nBritish Columbia has worked since 2001 to help the species recover, drawing teams of provincial and federal biologists, First Nations groups and the industries tied to sturgeon habitat loss, like hydroelectric dam operators.\n\nEfforts include using hatcheries, a “stopgap measure” to help the population recover, as well a longer-term goal of restoring habitat.\n\nBut the sudden death of 11 members of a species already spiralling towards demise mirrors a trend all over the world: sturgeon have become the most threatened genus of fish.\n\nAll of the 26 remaining species of sturgeon are now at risk of extinction. They are the victims of overfishing; in some species, like beluga sturgeon, the roe is prized as caviar. And the habitats they have persisted in are disappearing.\n\n“They are a quite a charismatic species and it’s a fish that has been around for millions of years. So you don’t take it lightly when it’s in danger,” McAdam said.\n\nThe abruptness with which the fish have died has puzzled biologists in part because white sturgeon have been closely studied and monitored for the last three decades, precisely because of their precarious situation.\n\n“And then within a week, this happens. We have a new huge question mark,” said Gantner. “It’s really blindsided us.”\n\nBoth Gantner and McAdam were hopeful that the deaths will serve a broader end, providing valuable insight to biologists into what might have happened – and how a similar outcome can be prevented in the future.\n\nBecause the other option – that they have already reached some kind of a tipping point – is too bleak to consider.\n\n“We’ve never done the experiment of eliminating them fully and seeing how truly important sturgeon are to an ecosystem,” said McAdam. “And personally, I don’t think we ever want to.”",
    "Mounties’ missteps creating crisis of confidence in Canada’s police": "Hours after the arrest earlier this month of a fugitive wanted in connection with the stabbing deaths of 11 people, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police hastily called a press conference to announce that Myles Sanderson was “no longer a threat” to the public.\n\nBut as RCMP assistant commissioner Rhonda Blackmore described the four-day manhunt, she omitted a critical detail: Sanderson, who had been taken into custody alive, was already dead.\n\nIt was nearly five minutes after announcing his arrest that Blackmore added that Sanderson had died after he went into “medical distress” and was transported to hospital.\n\nReporters covering the press conference were in disbelief. “I have never seen a more egregious case of burying the lede,” tweeted Siobhan Morris of CTV News.\n\nAfter two mass killings in two years – both among the worst in the country’s history –the institutional opaqueness of Canada’s national police force has once again become the focus of criticism. These public communication fumbles – and a troubled legacy of scandals, lawsuits and policing failures – have renewed longstanding questions over the force’s structure.\n\nIn the days since Sanderson’s death, questions over police actions and communication with the public have continued to mount. National media have repeatedly pressed the force after the police said they would not release autopsy results.\n\nAnd it emerged that – despite the fact that earlier in the summer an arrest warrant had been issued for Sanderson on unrelated charges – police do not appear to have been searching for him until he launched his stabbing spree on 4 September.\n\n“In many ways, the RCMP has lurched from crisis to crisis,” said Kent Roach, professor of law at the University of Toronto.\n\nPolice have not publicly speculated on what triggered the eruption of violence in which Sanderson killed 10 people aged between 23 and 78 in the James Smith Cree Nation, an Indigenous community in northern Saskatchewan, and the neighbouring village of Weldon.\n\nAfter the attacks, Sanderson remained at large for four days, with local communities on edge amid a string of false sightings.\n\nAs officers searched for Sanderson, the RCMP was itself the subject of a sprawling public inquiry over its response to another mass killing on the other side of the country, when a lone gunman shot and killed 22 people over the course of 12 hours in rural Nova Scotia.\n\nThe RCMP commissioner, Brenda Lucki, speaks with victims’ family members at an event after the mass stabbing at James Smith Cree Nation, Saskatchewan. Photograph: Heywood Yu/AP\n\nIn that case, police failed to send an emergency alert warning locals of the ongoing threat, and waited 12 hours to alert the public that the suspect was driving a fake police car. The public inquiry heard that two victims died in the time it took Canadian police to get internal approval to tweet a warning to the public about the suspect.\n\nAs the commission wrapped up this week, lawyer Sarah McCullough, who represents most of the 22 victims’ families, said the RCMP demonstrated it was fundamentally untrained, unprepared and unequipped for a major mass killing in a rural area.\n\nDuring the Saskatchewan attack, multiple alerts were sent out to warn residents of the threat. The RCMP also worked closely with local police forces, something they were criticized for not doing in Nova Scotia.\n\n“We definitely saw some improvements in their general communications in Saskatchewan, but it is disturbing there has not been more information about how Mr Sanderson died,” said Roach, author of the recent book Canadian Policing: Why and How It Must Change.\n\nOn Wednesday, Saskatchewan’s chief coroner announced that two inquests – for the stabbing victims and Myles Sanderson – would be launched in the spring.\n\n“With the suspect deceased, there will not be a public criminal trial. Without a public hearing of the facts, it will leave many questions unanswered from the families involved and the public pertaining to the circumstances leading to the deaths,” chief coroner Clive Weighill said in a statement.\n\nA jury in the inquest will only be able to establish fact, not guilt, but can also issue recommendations.\n\n“It is my intention to have the jury wholly comprised of Indigenous persons,” said Weighill.\n\nDue to a quirk of Canadian policing, the RCMP oversees both federal criminal law enforcement as well as operating contract police services to most provinces and municipalities. Only Ontario, Quebec and Newfoundland have their own police forces. But even in Newfoundland, the RCMP handles much of the rural policing.\n\nPeople hold candles at a vigil remembering the stabbing victims in front of City Hall in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan.

The force has only one officer dedicated to policing the 2,400 residents of James Smith Cree Nation.\n\nIn wake of the Saskatchewan attack, the James Smith Cree Nation has discussed creating its own police force to better address the needs of First Nation residents.\n\nThe challenges of enforcing the law on Canada’s rural regions was underlined in 2019 when two teenage murder suspects eluded capture for weeks as they fled into the forested wilds of northern Manitoba. Police only found their bodies after deploying aircraft, heat-sensing technology and dog teams.\n\n“The reality of policing of sparsely populated rural areas is something that Canada really needs to grapple with,” said Roach, who has called for a substantial overhaul of the force. “How much are Canadians willing to pay for policing of these communities?”",
    "Message to Canada": "WITH its advisory for Indians in Canada and those travelling to the country, New Delhi has sent as strong a message as any to the Trudeau government that it is fast losing patience with Ottawa for not paying heed to India’s serious concerns on issues of national unity and religious peace. That the ties were nosediving was evident when the Ministry of External Affairs expressed dissatisfaction over Canada’s feeble response to complaints regarding the so-called Khalistan referendum held in Brampton. The tough diplomatic stance that it cannot be ‘business as usual’ puts the onus on Ottawa. Its refusal to act against those who espouse anti-India sentiments could dent efforts for having a broader relationship, particularly on strategic and economic matters.\n\nThe scars caused by terrorism, mass killings, political assassinations and the 1984 riots are all deeply embedded in the Punjabi psyche. The slightest hint of any attempt to disturb the hard-won peace in the state draws strong condemnation, cutting across religious lines, and a collective resolve to stand up against it. Canada, when it allows the fringe elements among the Sikh diaspora to fuel separatism and violence in the name of religious secessionism, betrays India’s and, indeed, Punjab’s trust. All the more so when the huge Indian presence and contribution in Canada reflect a success story of multiculturalism and adherence to the law of the land.\n\nIt took a lot of time to repair bilateral ties after Ottawa’s unsettling attitude in the wake of the Kanishka plane bombing in 1985 that left all 329 people on board dead, most of them Canadian citizens. Negligence and significant delays marked the investigation. Turning a blind eye to extremist groups is a policy whose time has run out. Inaction by Canada’s political leadership now would mean that Indian sensitivities do not count for much. The consequences would be in neither country’s interest.",
    "Opinion: Why are Chinese police operating in Canada, while our own government and security services apparently look the other way?": "Unit 1 & 2 at 220 Royal Crest CT, in Markham, Ont. This addredd home to a registered NGO is reportedly being used by Chinese police as a base of operations in the GTA.YADER GUZMAN/The Globe and Mail\n\nCharles Burton is a senior fellow at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute in Ottawa, and non-resident senior fellow of the European Values Center for Security Policy in Prague. He served as a diplomat at Canada’s embassy in Beijing.\n\nIn China, the high-profile TV drama In The Name Of The People has become a smash hit. In that show, Chinese agents enter the U.S. posing as businessmen so they can repatriate a factory manager who had fled abroad with huge ill-gotten wealth.\n\nBut a new study by the European non-governmental agency Safeguard Defenders suggests that there might be some truth to the fiction. According to the NGO, the Fuzhou Public Security Bureau has established more than 50 “overseas police service centres” in cities around the world – including three publicly documented ones in Toronto, home to Canada’s largest Chinese diaspora.\n\nThis is an outrage. Chinese police setting up offices in Canada, then “persuading” alleged criminals to return to the motherland to face “justice” – while our own government and security services apparently choose to look the other way – represents a gross violation of Canada’s national sovereignty, international law and the norms of diplomacy. China is extending the grip of its Orwellian police state into this country, with seemingly no worry about being confronted by our own national security agencies.\n\nThe RCMP and politicians of all stripes routinely condemn Chinese state harassment of people in Canada, but what action has been taken? There have been no arrests or any expulsion of any Chinese diplomats who might be co-ordinating this kind of thuggery.\n\nBeijing describes these global police outposts as administrative centres to help Chinese nationals renew driver’s licences and other domestic banalities back home. But the Safeguard Defenders study found that they also hunt down political dissidents, corrupt officials or rogue Chinese alleged criminals and urge them to return home.\n\nThe summary says some of these operatives are given cover by being formally attached to local Chinese Overseas Home Associations (which have themselves largely become co-opted by the Chinese Communist Party’s United Front Work operations and run out of China’s embassy and consulates).\n\nThis bold strategy is consistent with China’s propensity for routinely flouting international laws, including those that require any other country’s police wishing to gather evidence in Canada to work through the RCMP.\n\nIn the case of these “police service centres,” Safeguard Defenders reports that agents press their targets to return home, including by offering vague promises of leniency or even urging families back home to encourage them to do so. The officers have taken aim at these alleged (and unproven) criminals by seizing their families’ assets, denying children in China access to schools, and terminating family members’ employment, all in violation of due process.\n\nIn Canada, this has been a reality for years. In 2001, during refugee hearings in Vancouver for Lai Changxing – a businessman wanted by Beijing over accusations of corruption and smuggling – Chinese police admitted to entering Canada using fake documents, and even to spiriting in Mr. Lai’s brother in an attempt to convince him to return home. Canadian authorities effectively smiled benignly at this serious breach of criminal and immigration law; Mr. Lai was eventually deported back to China.\n\nCanada is becoming China’s chew toy. Consider Beijing’s alleged disinformation campaign which helped “unfriendly” Conservative MPs of Chinese ethnicity, including Kenny Chiu, lose their seats in the 2021 federal election.\n\nOttawa wants Canadian businesses to be able to tap into the world’s largest market. But the price of this access appears to be ignoring Beijing’s Canadian agenda, from military and industrial espionage to harassing Canadian Uyghurs, Tibetans, Falun Gong practitioners and ethnic Chinese and Taiwanese people who reject Beijing’s hectoring that they should be loyal to China instead of to Canada.\n\nDoes Canada have no security capabilities on the issue? Our police and security agencies must surely know what is going on, but for some reason prefer to simply curate their information rather than act on it. When asked by The Globe and Mail about the police service centres, an RCMP spokesperson said the force would not comment on “uncorroborated media reports or statements.” And most of the information we receive about China’s illegal and “grey zone” activities in Canada typically comes from the U.S. government and well-funded security and intelligence-focused think tanks in Australia and Europe.\n\nThe more we ignore reports of China’s growing presence in Canada – including its interference in our electoral process, its potential espionage in our universities and research institutes, and so on – the more emboldened and manipulative Chinese agents become. With no sign that it will be held accountable, China will only increase the size and threat of its operations, because it can.\n\nWith its seeming indifference toward China’s blatant contempt for our laws and security, Ottawa is playing an extremely dangerous game with Canada’s sovereignty.",
    "Getting to Canada just got easier: ArriveCan app requirement is ending": "ArriveCan, the phone app required for entry into Canada since some border restrictions were eased in April because of Covid-19 concerns, is about to become a thing of the past.\n\nCanada's Ministry of Health announced Monday it will lift the requirement on Saturday, allowing entry to the country without ArriveCan or the need to isolate or quarantine if travelers test positive for Covid-19, according to a CBC report.\n\nSupport Local Journalism Your subscription makes our reporting possible. Support this work for $1 a month\n\nThe development, long sought on both sides of the border amid a precipitous drop in crossings – for which many blame the ArriveCan requirement – now lifts many of the restrictions placed on entering Canada imposed at the onset of the Covid crisis in March of 2020. It means the Canadian government will end random testing, drop any vaccine requirement and make use of ArriveCan voluntary.\n\nRep. Brian Higgins, D-Buffalo, who has long pressed for return to normal conditions, hailed Monday's announcement, adding he will press Washington to lift its remaining requirements for those entering the United States.\n\n“It has been two and a half long years of border restrictions between the United States and Canada,\" Higgins said. \"The extended measures have kept loved ones apart and kept border communities from reaching full economic recovery. The end of restrictions is overdue. Canada’s decision is the right one.

    "Will Canada cut ties to the monarchy under King Charles? It’s possible": "The death of Queen Elizabeth, the reigning monarch of the British Empire, the Commonwealth and therefore Canada, does not create a constitutional crisis in our system of government. It automatically triggered the ascension of King Charles.\n\nCanada, ostensibly an independent country since 1867, now has its first new monarch since 1952. But a lot has changed since then.\n\nTHE CANADIAN PRESS\n\nIn 1982, Canada adopted a newly written Constitution that included the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the recognition of aboriginal treaty rights and a home-grown means of amending the Constitution in Canada without the involvement of British parliament.\n\nCanada also retired the old red ensign that included the Union Jack and raised the red-and-white flag featuring the maple leaf in 1965. Nonetheless, Canada remains a constitutional monarchy and not a constitutional republic despite these American-style moves toward independence.\n\nLoyal to the British monarchy\n\nCanada’s evolution as a modern state centred on its loyalty to the British Crown, a clear alternative to the American experiment as a democratic republic nearly a century earlier.\n\nThe American Revolution was premised on an explicit, violent rejection of the Crown in favour of a presidential form of government. Whatever its problems and failings, it was a great moment of human innovation.\n\nBut despite staying loyal to the Crown, Canada would begin to drift away from the old British model 100 years later.\n\nThe year 2022 is a possible inflection point as the long reigning and personally popular Queen Elizabeth is succeeded by her less popular eldest son.\n\nFor Americans, this may be a celebrity story first and foremost. But for Canadians, Australians, New Zealanders and other citizens of Commonwealth countries, the monarchy is tied to their system of government, symbolic representation and identity.\n\nCutting ties in the Caribbean\n\nThe recent decision by the Caribbean island of Barbados to abandon the monarchy and become a republic likely portends similar outcomes in Jamaica, Antigua and Barbuda and elsewhere in the region.\n\nEven in the U.K., support for the monarchy has been declining for decades, although the majority still support it. According to some sources, younger Britons in particular are losing faith in the monarchy and leaning toward republicanism.\n\nSome commentators suggest with good reason that abandoning the monarchy in Canada would be all but impossible as a constitutional question, though all bets would obviously be off if the U.K. dumped the monarchy first.\n\nWhile the United States comes to grips with its authoritarian tendencies and the rise of white nationalism, Canada and other Commonwealth countries are increasingly focused on race relations, in particular the role of the Crown in relation to the transatlantic slave trade, imperialism and the treatment of Indigenous Peoples.\n\nThese issues all pertain to the historical role of the Crown and the British monarch in the fundamental legitimacy of our states and legal orders. Although Canada didn’t fight a revolutionary war for a republican form of government like the U.S. did, it’s moved closer to an American, republican model of government and further from the British one over the course of its legal, political and constitutional history.\n\nBreaks from the Crown\n\nCanada’s first break with the Crown occurred in 1867 when it became an independent dominion and adopted a division of powers between the founding provinces and the federal Parliament in Ottawa. The second major break was almost 100 years later, when it patriated the Constitution in 1982.\n\nWhile it’s true Canada retained the British hereditary monarch as its head of state in both 1867 and 1982, that doesn’t mean it has to do the same in the 21st century.\n\nGranted, Canada has not held a referendum on transitioning to a constitutional republic as Australia did in 1999 when citizens opted to maintain ties to the Crown. But the recent decision by Barbados to ditch the monarchy suggests that the global decolonization process is ongoing and that anti-imperial ideology has teeth across the region.\n\nCanadians, Australians and New Zealanders who are the descendants of slaves or Indigenous Peoples have likely been inspired by these developments. Those sentiments will only intensify now that the popular Queen has died.\n\nCanada’s particular reckoning with the role of the Catholic Church, the Church of England and the Crown itself in residential schools and colonial genocide makes the Royal Family’s attributes of continuity and tradition seem like strange reasons to keep them around.\n\nRead more: Not in the past: Colonialism is rooted in the present\n\nTime to reflect on Canada’s future\n\nThe death of Queen Elizabeth and the ascension of King Charles should present a moment of reflection for Canada, especially as Caribbean Commonwealth nations begin to abandon the monarchy.\n\nThe world admired the Queen. But whatever her personal qualities, it’s time to determine how the monarchy aligns with Canada’s current situation as an independent country and its aspirations for the future, especially if it wants to take itself seriously as a modern, 21st century nation focused on reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples.\n\nTHE CANADIAN PRESS/Darren Calabrese\n\nAs a matter of constitutional law, unanimity of all provincial legislatures and both houses of federal Parliament would be required to remove the monarchy from its place at the heart of our formal and symbolic constitutional order.\n\nIt would also likely require a referendum in each province before any of the provincial legislatures or Parliament would take such a vote.\n\nThat would be difficult, and probably wouldn’t succeed on the first or even second try, but it’s hardly impossible. Opinion polls suggest that although a majority of Canadians admired the Queen, only about half are in any way committed to the monarchy as an institution.\n\nYounger, more diverse and Indigenous citizens may begin demanding a country in their own image, a country that belongs not only to those who settled it but to those there long before then — and those choosing to make it their home today.",
    "News Wrap: Eastern Canada residents reeling after Fiona": "Geoff Bennett:\n\nGood evening. It's great to be with you.

The storm is forecast to reach hurricane strength as early as overnight and could make landfall along the Gulf Coast of Florida by Thursday or Friday.\n\nPresident Biden preemptively declared an emergency for the state, making federal government assistance available as the storm draws closer.\n\nMeantime in Canada residents are reeling in the wake of Hurricane Fiona. The storm washed homes into the sea and hurricane strength winds tore apart homes and toppled trees. Hundreds of thousands of Canadians remain without power and the Canadian military has been mobilized to assist in the recovery. Officials there say it will take months to rebuild.\n\nIn Italy polls are closing at this hour as the country chooses a new government that could be both historic and could pivot the nation toward far right leadership. Opinion polls suggest that Italy could pick its first ever female prime minister, Giorgio Meloni.

    "No ‘Rah-Rah Canada’ for Amazon Studios: Streamer On the Hunt for Half-Hour Formats That Aren’t Uber-Canadian": "Amazon Studios wants to beef up its content library in Canada. And the quickest way to do that, according to Brent Haynes, the studio’s head of originals in Canada, is with half-hour formats.\n\n“With the exception of ‘Three Pines,’ we are doing half-hours and that’s because they help quickly build our library. But, that is also one of the gaps in our programming,” Haynes said recently during a Content Canada session in Toronto.\n\n“A lot of our other territories are doing one-hours and crime dramas, so we don’t need to repeat that,” he continued. “We are aware of what’s coming out around the world and we try to each make something that would help our other territories.”\n\nIn order to achieve that robust library, Haynes revealed the goal is to have anywhere from 5 to 10 shows in development at a time. “In our minds, every single one of those is going to go,” he said. “We’re not naïve to think they all will, because they fall apart and our needs change. But we’re finding because we love it, we want to make it.”\n\nSpecifically, Haynes is looking for local and unique stories that have a global appeal. What he’s not looking for are limited series or shows that are “hyper-localized” and inaccessible to mass audiences.\n\n“We want a unique Canadian perspective on everything,” he explained. “We’re not trying to tell stories that are rah-rah Canada, or are uber-Canadian, or check boxes that say, ‘This is what’s Canadian.’ But we do want something that we feel is unique to the territory,” he continued.\n\n“It has to hit a bar and that bar is really, really high. We know most Prime customers sign up for their free package delivery. But there’s still an expectation that they’re paying for this service. There has to be some sort of premium element to it,” said Haynes.\n\nThe executive added the general Amazon Studios model is to work backwards in terms of starting with data that models what its customers are looking for and then figuring out how to fill in those gaps.\n\n“We’re looking to make shows that Canadians will watch based on the research and the amount of data,” he said. “The strategy isn’t to just take great pitches, which we will, but we also want pitches in this area because we know this is what we need. The strategy is to find the best of the best.”\n\nThis past April, Amazon Studios Canada revealed a slate of Canadian original productions including the return of “The Kids in the Hall” and a companion docuseries, an adult animation series called “Gary and His Demons,” comedy drama series “The Sticky,” and the aforementioned “Three Pines” starring Alfred Molina and based on the book series by Louise Penny.\n\nChristina Wayne, who played a key role in the development of the Canadian originals strategy since joining the company in 2019, left her role as head of Canadian originals earlier this month to pursue other interests. Haynes joined the company as head of scripted series in May 2021 and was promoted this past August.\n\nHaynes was one of several executives on hand during the two-day Content Canada event, which also boasted Spotlight Stage sessions with Paramount+, Tubi Originals and Disney Plus.

It is available year-round, but doesn’t provide parents/grandparents with the same options to PR and eventually citizenship, as the PGP.\n\nEligibility\n\nAt minimum, candidates hoping to sponsor their parents/grandparents through either program must be:\n\nAt least 18 years old;\n\nA Canadian citizen, or PR;\n\nResiding in Canada at the time of application and when parents/grandparents are expected to arrive;\n\nOf good financial standing;\n\nIneligibility\n\nIn addition to failure to comply with the eligibility criteria, candidates will also be ineligible for either program if they:\n\nDid not pay back an immigration loan, a performance bond, or court-ordered family support (i.e.: alimony or child support);\n\nDid not provide promised financial support they agreed to when sponsoring a family member in the past;\n\nFall under any other ineligibility criteria.\n\nFinancial requirements\n\nFor the Super Visa, candidates will have to prove that their household meets the required Low-Income Cut-Off (LICO) criteria.\n\nFor the PGP, candidates should look to meet the Minimum Necessary Income (MNI) requirements for the program. Candidates must show proof of funds by requesting a Notice of Assessment (NOA) from the Canadian Revenue Agency (CRA); showing that the sponsor has met the MNI for their case, and has done so for the last three taxation years, before applying.\n\nApplication process\n\nFor Super Visa sponsorship, the application process is similar to that of a regular TRV. Additional documentation is needed, however, to prove that parents/grandparents can be looked after, upon arriving in Canada.\n\nFor the PGP, candidates must follow the steps to meet and prove their eligibility, and then submit this information to be included in the candidate pool. If candidates are selected, they will receive an invitation to apply, which carries subsequent steps.\n\nFor either the PGP or the Super Visa, the sponsored individuals cannot be medically or criminally inadmissible to come to Canada. An Immigration Medical Exam (IME) is required for both programs, and the PGP also requires a police certificate.\n\nAvailability in Quebec\n\nBoth programs are available to Quebec residents and citizens as well, though there are added steps, including a unique MNI system (for both sponsor and the sponsored), and the need to obtain a Quebec Selection Certificate (CSQ).\n\nSponsor your family for Canadian immigration\n\n© CIC News All Rights Reserved.

    "Preview: Canada faces Uruguay in important pre-World Cup match": "It’s finally happening. It’s just around the proverbial corner. The match Canadian footy fans have been long waiting for. Where Friday’s affair with Qatar was entertaining, it is viewed by many as the warm-up to this window’s main event – Tuesday’s tilt with South American and world heavyweight Uruguay.\n\nThere has been no recent competitive history between the two countries. Canada’s only previous senior match with Uruguay was on February 2nd, 1986, a 3-1 defeat for Canada at the Miami Cup. George Pakos was Canada’s goal scorer that day, with his fifth and final tally in his Canada career.\n\nUruguay is ranked 13th by FIFA and 11th in the more current Elo rankings whereas Canada is well back at 43rd in FIFA rankings and tied at 29th with South Korea in the Elo system. The “qualitative advantages” possessed by Uruguay are not lost on John Herdman, who has stated,\n\n“I have to say the game against Uruguay, that was a massive coup for Canada to pull that one off in Europe,...That’s going to be a real test and it’s not necessarily a tactical test. This will be the first time you play a team of $400-million value. When you think you play the U.S., and they’re at that 250-mark, you double that now when you are playing Uruguay.”\n\nHerdman further remarked\n\n”It’s just another level. We can’t wait. It’s pretty exciting.”\n\nCanada’s roster is missing some key personnel, such as midfielder and national team captain Atiba Hutchinson, Doneil Henry, and last minute withdrawal Jonathan Osorio. The latter’s nagging head injury producing “neurological dysfunction” symptoms is becoming a concern to John Herdman. Tajon Buchanan has been a late arrival to the camp and is expected to play limited minutes on Tuesday as he recovers from injury. Alphonso Davies took a knock just prior to leaving the Qatar game, but it appears to have not been too serious and has resumed regular training with the team.\n\nHerdman has brought a seeming surfeit of wingers and attackers into the squad. Who and how many play is up for debate. Four of five strikers brought into the CanMNT camp saw the field against Qatar on Friday with the odd man out being Lucas Cavallini. Given Cavallini’s South American roots and early career playing professionally in Uruguay, he will be chomping at the bit to see action against La Celeste. However, it is more likely he comes off the bench rather than starts.\n\nWingers in the squad who did not see action against Qatar include Theo Corbeanu, Luca Koleosho, and the aforementioned Buchanan. The question on many supporters’ minds is whether Herdman will put the 18-year-old dual national Koleosho into the game. While a single appearance in a friendly match will not cap tie the young prospect, it may reflect a statement of intent for his future.\n\nUruguay is a two-time World Cup winner in 1930 and 1950, albeit both times before the tournament required qualification processes for all participating teams, or experienced significant boycotts by leading footballing nations.\n\nOfficial - @Uruguay’s 26 players for the friendlies vs. Iran and Canada\n\n\n\n• Absences: Cavani and Josema\n\n• Additions: Rogel [DF, Hertha ], S. Cáceres [DF, America ] and Satriano [FW, Empoli ] pic.twitter.com/ctCjpKvhmE — Uruguay Football ENG (@UruguayFootENG) September 16, 2022\n\nThe current Uruguay roster is transitioning to a younger team with many of the mainstays from the past decade missing out this window, and some finding more time on the bench than on the pitch. Household names such as second all-time leading scorer Edinson Cavani, long-time captain and all-time caps leader Diego Godin and his oftentimes central defence partner José Giménez have been ruled out by injuries.\n\n.@valenciacf manager Gattuso has confirmed that Cavani will not join Uruguay for the upcoming friendlies vs. Iran and Canada pic.twitter.com/KTXrzjkGMf — Uruguay Football ENG (@UruguayFootENG) September 16, 2022\n\nHowever, veterans such as long-time goalkeeper Fernando Muslera, defender Martín Cáceres, who recently signed for the LA Galaxy, and all-time top scorer Luis Suárez are with the Uruguay squad. They will be supported by younger stars like strikers Darwin Núñez of Liverpool and Facundo Pellistri of Manchester United, and centre-back Ronald Araújo of Barcelona. Araújo, however, left the game with Iran early with an injury and is a doubt for the Canada game. The average age of the 23 outfield players for Uruguay this window is 26 years of age.\n\nThe real test for Les Rouges, as sought by Herdman, is with the Uruguay midfield. A source of strength for Uruguay no matter who they play in midfield, the straw that stirs the drink for the Uruguay midfield, is Federico Valverde. A rising star with his club Real Madrid, Valverde is a La Liga player of the month award nominee for September. Since the start of 2022, Uruguay tended to play with either a four or five man midfield, but its last two games have featured a midfield three.\n\nThe midfield battle with Uruguay is of particular interest to Herdman’s World Cup planning as Canada will face a pair of strong midfields in Belgium and Croatia in November. Missing Hutchinson and Osorio has thrown a wrench into Herdman’s planning. Nevertheless, it will be a test for the five midfielders called into this camp to provide a glimpse for Herdman to see what they might expect in the upcoming World Cup matches and to see which midfielders complement Stephen Eustáquio best should Hutchinson not be ready in November.\n\nCanada is coming off a comfortable 2-0 win over World Cup hosts Qatar on Friday September 23rd while Uruguay were surprised by Iran 1-0 that same day. Iran put on a tenacious defensive display against an overall superior Uruguay side, but made the most of their limited chances and scored on a late counter. The loss was current Uruguay manager Diego Alonso’s first taste of defeat with La Celeste.\n\n3 Keys to the Game\n\nHow will the Canadian defence hold up against a high-quality attack such as Uruguay? From the perspective of many observers Canada entered the Octagonal with a suspect back line but then came out with the qualifying tournament’s best defensive record. Not to belabour the obvious, but Uruguay is decidedly not another CONCACAF opponent. The midfield battle. How will Canada fare against Uruguay’s dominant midfield? This is as good a test as Herdman could ask for his midfield, even with Canada missing a few important pieces in Hutchinson and Osorio. Will Canada be able to contain Valverde and Bentancur? Canada’s stamina and ability to maintain their defensive shape will be crucial as time on the ball is not expected to be in Canada’s favour. Canada’s counter-attack. Can Canada’s speed on the wings and quickness in transition tip the balance in a game where possession will most certainly be ceded to Uruguay? Will Canada generate sufficient opportunities for its strength to show itself and make a difference?\n\nFor Canada to succeed against Uruguay, let alone Belgium and Croatia in November, the first two keys need to be executed to such a degree that it will allow the third key to be executed by the team’s stars.\n\nPredicted Line-ups\n\nCanada – 3-4-3: Milan Borjan; Kamal Miller, Steven Vitoria, Alistair Johnston - Samuel Adekugbe, Stephen Eustáquio, Samuel Piette, Theo Corbeanu – Alphonso Davies, Jonathan David, Cyle Larin.\n\nUruguay – 4-3-3: Sergio Rochet; Damián Suárez, Augustin Rogel, Sebastián Cáceres, Mathías Olivera - Federico Valverde, Matías Vecino, Rodrigo Bentancur - Facundo Pellistri, Luis Suárez, Darwin Núñez.",
    "Canada Called Itself a Genocide State. Iran Was Listening": "When dictators are called out by the international community for perpetrating human-rights abuses, they often attempt to deflect criticism by accusing their Western critics of hypocrisy. In April, for instance, China denounced the US State Department’s annual Country Report on Beijing’s human-rights practices as “a pretense the U.S. government uses to cover up its agenda of seeking hegemony” over such nations as Afghanistan. “The U.S. should immediately cease making irresponsible remarks,” said Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian. “Instead, it needs to reflect on itself, mend its ways, and work earnestly to improve its own human-rights situation.”\n\nIn substance, these attempts at moral equivalence lack credibility. But they can have the appearance of truth when our adversaries base their propaganda on self-incriminating statements made by the West’s own media figures and politicians.\n\nThis week, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi took the rostrum at the United Nations General Assembly to deliver Iran’s habitual denunciations of Western “double standards.” While anti-hijab protests rocked numerous Iranian cities in the wake of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini’s death at the hands of Tehran’s morality police, Raisi went through a predictable laundry list of complaints, accusing Israel of creating the “world’s largest prison” in Gaza, and denouncing US detention policies at the Mexican border. But he also threw in an attack on Canada’s treatment of Indigenous peoples, declaring that “bodies of hundreds of children were discovered in mass graves in a [former residential] school.”\n\nAs a Canadian, I found this element of Raisi’s performance maddening. Thanks to Canada’s own misinformation mill, the Iranian President didn’t have to go to the bother of inventing his own lies. My own country’s journalists and leaders did that job for him.\n\nThe issue of supposed unmarked Indigenous child graves dominated the Canadian media in the latter half of 2021. But as I reported in Quillette several months ago, no “mass graves” were ever found. In fact, even the Indigenous groups that initially reported ground-penetrating radar (GPR) survey results consistent with the possible presence of unmarked burial sites weren’t talking about “mass graves.” Rather, the invented mass-graves claim was popularized by a badly botched New York Times May 28th, 2021, story written by reporter Ian Austen. (For a definitive debunking, see Terry Glavin’s account in Canada’s National Post).\n\nIn the 16 months that have passed since the unmarked-graves story broke in late May 2021, not a single body has been found, nor any human remains. And so even the less sensational allegation that 215 individual unmarked child graves lie buried under the grounds of a former Indigenous residential school in Kamloops, British Columbia, now seems doubtful. Nor have bodies or human remains been recovered at any of the other former residential-school properties where GPR surveys were conducted.\n\nYet that didn’t prevent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau from lowering flags on Canadian public buildings for more than five months, nor from speaking publicly as if bodies were already being dug up. And aside from the National Post, not a single major Canadian media outlet has admitted its role in feeding the unmarked-graves social panic that exploded last year, and which often included lurid speculation that the supposed grave sites not only contained the remains of Indigenous children, but that these children had been murdered through methods worthy of a horror-movie plot.\n\nGiven this, what can Canadian public figures say to Raisi now that he’s throwing spurious moral equivalences into our faces? Nothing. In making the false claim that “bodies of hundreds of children were discovered in mass graves in a [former residential] school,” the man is merely reading our own officially sourced misinformation back to us.\n\nThis isn’t the first time that Trudeau has managed to maneuver Canada into this kind of mortifying position vis-à-vis the world’s tyrants. Last year, when Canadian lawmakers voted to denounce China’s treatment of Uighurs in western Xinjiang as a form of genocide, Trudeau and his Cabinet abstained. The suspected reasons for that move were complex. But they included the fact that Canada was, by its own description, morally compromised on the genocide file: Back in 2019, Trudeau had explicitly acceded to the (absurd) claim that Canada, too, was guilty of “genocide”—this one against Indigenous women. Indeed, according to the official report that precipitated Trudeau’s mea culpa, this supposed Canadian genocide remains ongoing.\n\nThe leaders of Russia, Belarus, Iran, North Korea, Syria, and Venezuela know a good propaganda opening when they see one. Last year, these nations collectively called on the UN to investigate crimes against Canada’s Indigenous peoples—doing so, cleverly, on the same day that Western nations were launching a UN campaign to demand that China allow international investigators access to Xinjiang.\n\nWords have consequences—especially when they comprise the vocabulary of mass slaughter. The repetition of ghoulish hyperbole about Canada doesn’t just gratuitously harm the country’s reputation. It also helps the world’s autocrats get away with crimes that are anything but fictional.",
    "International students' visa backlog due to an outdated system: lawyer": "An ongoing Canadian immigration backlog of 151,000 applications has left many international students at risk of missing their entire fall semesters altogether. Many schools are recommending they defer their semesters, effectively leaving these students in limbo.\n\nFederal data shows that, as of the end of July, 34 per cent of pending international student visa applications were taking longer to process than government standards dictate.\n\nImmigration lawyer Mario Bellissimo says a main cause of the backlog is an outdated immigration system that attempts to push a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to most applicants.\n\nWhile COVID-19 exacerbated the issue, the problem is more historical, Bellissimo told CTV’s Your Morning on Monday. Arguing that the system has been ‘slow to modernize,’ he advocates a more nuanced approach.\n\n“We need to have provincial specific study permit categories (and) better training and regulation of educational agents that are tracking these students to Canada,” he said.\n\nAccording to Bellissimo, the current immigration pathway of a one-to-four-year study permit, which often leads to a work permit for international students after graduation, doesn’t always guarantee a permanent residence. He says this needs to be made clear to applicants.\n\n“If you remove the one-size-fits-all (system), you'll have a more nuanced system, one that has caps and terminates when individuals can’t be processed in time,” he said, adding that this will allow students to move on.\n\nInternational students now make up almost 20 per cent of all students enrolled in post-secondary institutions in Canada, up from 7.2 per cent in 2010. This group is often considered a potential solution to the country’s aging workforce.\n\nBut, the path to steady employment and citizenship for them is paved with complicated immigration requirements and barriers to entry in many workforces, a report published earlier this month by RBC Economics and Thought Leadership has found.\n\n“For many, a Canadian education may not yield the desired return on investment,” the report stated.\n\nBellissimo says that there isn’t much that the students who are currently in the immigration backlog awaiting their visas can do.\n\n“It's very difficult to deliver a meaningful remedy to these students and so, a lot of their lives are being interrupted by this, and keep in mind when we're thinking about students, we're not just speaking about individuals coming for their first degree,” he said.\n\n“We're thinking about some accomplished students, some that have career experience, those that are coming with spouses and families.\n\nSo there's a lot of myth-busting that has to happen here. And, understanding how many lives this really impacts.”\n\nIn a statement to CTV’s Your Morning, the IRCC said that they are moving to a more “integrated, modernized and centralized working environment,” which is expected to help speed up application processing.\n\nBellissimo says that immigration systems in Canada need to leverage newer technology such as artificial intelligence if they plan to keep up with demand which, at the moment, outweighs supply.\n\nSo far this year, the IRCC has processed more than 360,000 study visas, a 17 per cent increase over the same period in 2021.\n\nThe High Commission of India in Ottawa said in a statement it was talking to Canadian universities about what can be done to accommodate the large number of Indian international students who are still waiting for visas.\n\nThe high commission said universities have also approached the immigration ministry with their concerns.\n\nSome institutions will provide a remote option for students unable to reach Canada at the start of the term because they have not yet received a visa.\n\n“We have to remain true to the principles of the program, which is really to draw in (the) future, potentially in some cases, future Canadians,” Bellissimo said.\n\n“You don't know who is in that backlog. Someone that may make a huge impact on Canada.”\n\nWith files from The Canadian Press",

    "Canada’s ties to crown are loosening but cutting them could be tall order": "The final hurdle for any immigrant suffering through a bitter Canadian winter or swatting away hordes of summertime bugs is to pledge allegiance to a monarch thousands of kilometres away from the new country they call home.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II was well liked by generations of Canadians, but her death and the ascension of her son Charles have revived a longstanding debate in the country, where support for the monarchy is in steady decline.\n\nBut unlike other states that have cut the link with the British crown – or are considering doing so – Canada is likely to remain tethered to the monarchy for no better reason than the convoluted rules that govern its constitution.\n\nThroughout Canada’s 155 years as a nation, a king or queen has served as head of state. Under Elizabeth, it was her favourite destination for a royal visit – of which there were 22 during her 70-year reign.\n\n“Thank you again for your welcome,” she told a rapt crowd in Halifax in 2010 on her final tour of the country. “It is very good to be home.”\n\nThe institution she represented, however, has increasingly fallen out of favour with Canadians, a majority of whom would prefer to see it abolished. For some, it’s stuffy and outdated. For others, it bears the weight of history, and the responsibility for centuries of suffering and dispossession of Indigenous peoples.\n\nNowadays, immigration drives Canada’s population growth and with many new Canadians arriving from countries that also suffered under colonialism, scepticism of the monarchy is only likely to grow, said Jonathan Malloy, a professor of political science at Carleton University who specializes in the study of parliamentary institutions.\n\nBut even so, the monarchy is likely to remain.\n\n“I’ve never really seen a serious discussion in Canada of exactly what steps would need to be taken to eliminate the crown and come up with a new sort of state structure,” said Malloy, pointing out that unlike other Commonwealth nations, Canada has never had a strong or “serious” republican movement.\n\nThe Queen is welcomed by a little girl at her arrival at the Torbay air force base, near St John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador, on 21 June 1959, during her visit to Canada. Photograph: Intercontinentale/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“What people don’t often realize is that the crown underlies everything: our legal and constitutional system, our parliamentary system. It’s everything,” said Malloy. “And to get rid of it isn’t as simple as severing the ties, or swapping ‘crown’ with ‘state’ in key documents.”\n\nUnder the 1982 Constitution Act, in order to sever ties with the monarchy, Canada would need approval from the House of Commons and the Senate, as well as the unanimous consent of all 10 provinces. But that would be nearly impossible, as provinces would fear that changes to the constitution could mean surrendering powers to the federal government.\n\nCanadians also have vivid memories of a tumultuous period in the 1980s and 1990s that included two failed attempts to amend the constitution and a brush with separatism that left leaders wary of dramatic change.\n\nAny political leader looking to abolish the monarchy would need to stomach significant disorder and confusion, as well as a wave of competing visions for a reformed constitution.\n\n“Any ‘solution’ could cause more problems than it solves,” said Malloy. “In a way, people do recognize that the system – even though it is weird – does have its strengths and works.”\n\nElizabeth’s death has come amid a larger reckoning over Canada’s past, its relationship to the crown and a legacy of colonial violence.\n\nAfter unmarked graves were discovered at the site of former residential schools more than a year ago, a harsh spotlight has been cast on Great Britain’s role in the country’s history.\n\nThe grim discovery prompted a furious backlash – in which statues of Elizabeth and Queen Victoria were toppled by protesters – but also a sustained debate over the long shadow of the country’s colonial past.\n\nNiigaan Sinclair, a professor of Native studies at the University of Manitoba, said that Indigenous views towards Elizabeth were varied and nuanced. Many saw her as a matriarch, a strong woman who cared about and led her family and community – and thus lived by values Indigenous people cherish and respect. But simultaneously, the Queen presided over “the most genocidal policies in history”, said Sinclair.\n\nIndigenous leaders often pleaded with her during official visits to Canada to advocate on their behalf to the federal government. The Queen promised to act, but nothing ever came of it, said Sinclair.\n\nHe pointed to her 1970 visit to Manitoba, when David Courchene, chief of the Manitoba Indian Brotherhood, asked the Queen why Canadians were so rich, while his people were so poor. Courchene asked if that disparity was a fulfilment of the treaties her ancestors had signed.\n\nParticular frustration has focused on the Queen’s perceived failure to intervene to prevent neglect and abuse in residential schools, Sinclair said.\n\nA toppled statue of Queen Elizabeth II lies face down on the grounds of the Manitoba legislature on 2 July 2021 in Winnipeg. The statue was pulled down by Indigenous protesters after a march to honour survivors and victims of Canada’s residential school system. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\n“She was extremely happy to use us for her public image. She had an opportunity to advocate in life-and-death situations and she didn’t do anything, so it’s hard to have a legacy of being proud of somebody like that,” said Sinclair.\n\nThe relationship between Indigenous peoples and the British royal family predates Canada’s foundation as a country and is largely embodied in treaties signed in the 1700s.\n\nThat long history means Indigenous views about the role of the sovereign in Canada are ambiguous and varied, said George Lafond, a former treaty commissioner for the province of Saskatchewan.\n\nAnd the relationship was further complicated when the Canadian government implemented the Indian Act in 1876, a sprawling piece of legislation that sharply restricted Indigenous autonomy.\n\nThis move “pushed everything aside”, Lafond said, leaving First Nations to question the crown’s sincerity in its negotiations. “Why did the crown let that happen?” he said.\n\nYet the Union Jack is still flown at powwows.\n\n“[My father] served the King and country, along with many other Indigenous men who fought for the symbols, language and culture of Britain,” said Lafond. “I have an obligation to his generation to respect what they did in their time.”\n\nSara Mainville, a Toronto-based lawyer specialising in treaty implementation and governance, says the treaties her ancestors signed with the crown represent a statement of trust that both nations could live peacefully side by side – and undoing those could be “traumatic” for many nations.\n\n“These treaties are a spiritual agreement, something that was solemnized in ceremony. We smoked the pipe afterwards. It’s not something that can be renegotiated. It’s a living thing. We need to honour its existence, and feed it and nurture it,” she said.\n\nDecades of neglect by the federal government represent a failure of the state to uphold its obligations – not of the treaties themselves, she said. For Mainville, the 1764 Treaty at Niagara set the stage for how Indigenous nations saw their relationship to the crown – one of mutual aid and benefit.\n\n“I see the treaties as an opportunity for both nations to be successful. The Indigenous perspective of treaty making is it’s a win-win. So why are we suffering?” said Mainville, who also served as chief of Couchiching First Nation. “Because the honour and trust has been broken.”\n\nMainville said if the relationship to the crown were to end, there was little trust among Indigenous nations that Canada’s federal or provincial governments, which have repeatedly failed in their duties, would negotiate new treaties that would hold Indigenous nations as peers.\n\n“The reality is, that’s just not going to happen.”",
    "Canada: Nova Scotia To End Immigration Detention in Jails": "Click to expand Image Nova Scotia becomes the Second Canadian Province to End Immigration Detention in its Jails. © Human Rights Watch 2022\n\n(Halifax) – Nova Scotia’s confirmation that it will terminate its immigration detention contract with the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) is another win for migrant and refugee rights, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International Canada said today. The move follows a landmark decision by British Columbia on July 21 to terminate its own contract with the border agency.\n\n“Nova Scotia’s decision is a momentous human rights victory that upholds the dignity and rights of people who come to Canada in search of safety or a better life,” said Samer Muscati, associate disability rights director at Human Rights Watch. “With two provinces now canceling their immigration detention contracts within weeks, the federal government should show leadership by canceling the remaining agreements, which are at the heart of so many rights violations.”\n\nOver the past five years, CBSA has incarcerated thousands of people on immigration grounds in dozens of provincial jails across the country. In Nova Scotia, they are held in provincial jails by default because the province has no dedicated immigration holding center. According to information accessed under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, as of April 2021 the federal government pays Nova Scotia one of the highest rates in the country, CAD $392.30 per day, for each immigration detainee.\n\n“As a result of Nova Scotia’s decision, immigration detainees will soon be spared the corrosive, human rights-impairing conditions of the province's jails, where solitary confinement, mass lockdowns and other forms of routine institutional violence have only intensified since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Sheila Wildeman, Co-Chair of East Coast Prison Justice Society and associate professor of law at Dalhousie University. “We call on the federal government to use the resources devoted to maintaining this brutal practice to instead invest in sustainable immigration settlement supports in the community.”\n\nIn a June 2021 report, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International documented that people in Canadian immigration detention are regularly handcuffed, shackled, and held with little to no contact with the outside world. Canada is among only a few countries in the global north with no legal limit on the duration of immigration detention, meaning people can be detained for months or years with no end in sight.\n\nThe border agency has full discretion over where people in immigration detention are held, with no legal standard guiding the agency’s decision to hold a person in a provincial jail rather than an immigration holding center. In the year following the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the agency relied more heavily on provincial jails, holding 40 percent of immigration detainees in those facilities, at least double the percentage in each of the three previous years.\n\nPeople with psychosocial disabilities (mental health conditions) experience discrimination throughout the immigration detention process. For example, CBSA policy indicates that immigration detainees with psychosocial disabilities may be incarcerated in provincial jails rather than dedicated federal immigration holding centers in order to access “specialized care.” People from communities of color, and Black people in particular, appear to be incarcerated for longer periods in immigration detention and often in provincial jails instead of immigration holding centers.\n\nAcross the Atlantic provinces and throughout the country, migrants and refugee claimants too frequently face abusive, open-ended immigration detention – especially traumatic for those fleeing war or persecution in search of a safe haven,” said Julie Chamagne, Executive Director of the Halifax Refugee Clinic. “Nova Scotia’s decision is an important step forward for human rights. We call on the federal government to enact robust legislative and regulatory changes to stop rights violations in this system across the country.”\n\nNova Scotia’s decision is building powerful momentum to end immigration detention in provincial jails, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International said. Since the start of the #WelcomeToCanada campaign in Nova Scotia six months ago, approximately 4,600 people have called on the province to take this step.\n\n“We commend Nova Scotia for its decision to stop locking up refugee claimants and migrants in the province’s jails solely on immigration grounds,” said Ketty Nivyabandi, secretary general of Amnesty International Canada (English Speaking). “There is now clear pressure to end this harmful practice across the country. We urge other provinces and the federal government to follow suit.”",

    "Jarring notes: Issues Indian students face in Canada": "Seema Sachdeva\n\nThe recent incident of hooliganism by some Indian students in Canada, which went viral, puts the spotlight on the issues they face in a foreign land\n\nLoud Punjabi music is blaring from a modified car with boys on a ‘geri’ route. A cop tries to stop them but the ‘kakas’ attempt to intimidate the police officer and use abusive language.\n\nAlso read: Woman Sikh police officer speaks on fate of 40 Punjabi youths who tried to ‘intimidate’ Canadian cop on duty\n\n40 Punjabi youths block Canadian police officer's car in Surrey; to face deportation\n\nMeanwhile, more boys of their ilk crowd around, some simply to watch, others making videos that they would later upload. The incident that has been shaking the social media took place in Strawberry Hill, Surrey (British Columbia) on September 11.\n\nThe car’s silencer (muffler) removed, a group of Indian students had been taking rounds in the Sheridan plaza area. Following a complaint over the loud music, a police officer reached the area. When he issued them a ticket, some started banging on the bonnet of the police car, one even tried to open the driver’s door. Fearing for his life, the officer immediately left the place.\n\nAs many as 40 youths, mostly students on study visa, are said to be involved, directly or indirectly, in this incident of hooliganism. According to Constable Sarbjit Sangha, media relations officer of the Surrey RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police), “Threatening and trying to intimidate a police officer on duty is a serious matter. One youth has been identified while investigation is on to identify others. Some of them may be deported to India. Earlier, too, we had deported some Punjabi youths for causing nuisance here.”\n\nTerming it completely unacceptable, Rachna Singh, MLA from Surrey Green Timbers and parliamentary secretary of anti-racism initiatives, says, “For the past two to three years, incidents of inappropriate behaviour by Indian students, particularly from Punjab, have been coming to our notice. This kind of reckless conduct by even a small number makes things difficult for the rest of the hard-working, sincere students who are here to change their fortunes.”\n\nProf Prabhjot Parmar of the University of Fraser Valley, Abbotsford, however, feels that such incidents must not be applied as a blanket representation of the Indian children coming to study here. “I’m sure such nuisance would not be tolerated even in India. While it will certainly bring attention to the fact that these 40-odd miscreants were international students, we have to understand that there are bound to be children with different types of behaviour, especially when such huge numbers are coming from India,” she says.\n\nCanada has been home away from home for Punjabis since long, but the last few years have seen a huge influx of students from India. Since the country opened its doors with the fast-track Student Direct Stream (SDS) programme, study visa has become a ticket to get permanent residency. Most of these students take admission in two-year diploma courses, which makes them eligible for a three-year work permit. According to the Canadian Bureau for International Education, there were 6,21,565 international students in Canada at all levels of study at the end of 2021. While there is no countrywise breakup, Indian students make up the maximum at 35 per cent. As many as 65 per cent of the Indian visa applications for Canada are from Punjab. The statistics released by the National Foundation for American Policy in March this year found that ever since visa restrictions increased in the US (from 2016 to 2019), the number of Indian students at Canadian colleges and universities went up by 182 per cent.\n\nFigures state that international students boost the Canadian economy by about $24 billion. Ruing this loss of human and financial resources, Gurbhajan Singh Gill, chairman of Punjabi Lok Virasat Academy, Ludhiana, says, “A large number of seats in our colleges are lying vacant, while children are thronging innumerable private shops offering IELTS training to leave the country where they see no opportunities for themselves. We need to look at where our education system is failing.”\n\nWith most Indians (read Punjabis) settled in Ontario and British Columbia (BC), a number of students from Punjab prefer to study and live in areas closer to Brampton and Surrey for a feel of home, besides easy availability of Indian food and no language hurdles. Students mostly live in groups of 10 to 15 in the basements, sharing the rent. They have gained a reputation of not maintaining the property well, besides indulging in brawls.\n\nSays Rishi Nagar, Senator at University of Calgary, “Most of the students come straight after finishing Class 12. In the absence of any parental guidance, many have no regard for the local laws and regulations. From driving cars with loud music and jumping red lights to jay walking on roads and stepping out in bathroom slippers, which is looked down upon here, they are clueless about the norms being followed. One understands the huge cultural difference that these students must be experiencing but their parents and families back home should guide them about the need to respect the norms and culture in another country.”\n\nThe incidence of fights among the students is limited, say only 5-7 per cent, but these get highlighted and noticed because of social media, feels Shameel Jasvir, host and news director at REDFM, Toronto. “Often, a few rich students who are not bothered about completing their courses can be seen driving flashy cars with Punjabi songs blaring. They create a bad name for the rest of the sincere and hardworking ones, who, too, are looked at with disdain by the established community here.” He says that the non-acceptance from the locals adds to their sense of isolation. They do not want to share their problems back home for the worry it would cause and often end up facing mental health issues, he says, adding that cases of death by suicide among students have also been reported over the past few years.\n\n“Making ends meet with a work permit of 20 hours a week is not enough. It is an open secret that many students work for cash, often at stores and warehouses owned by Indians. Many a time, the employers exploit them by making them work beyond the timing or pay them less than the fixed wages. Youths often get involved in drug peddling to make easy money. It is sad that there have also been instances of sexual assault on girl students while some of them even get into trafficking,” says Sameer Kaushal, news director at AM600 Sher-e-Punjab Radio, based in Richmond, BC.\n\nRakesh Kumar Rhythm, who is based in Langley, British Columbia, feels the kind of courses students are taking up is an issue. “Proper guidance is missing. Often immigration consultants and travel agents in India guide them to their commission-based diploma courses. For instance, the diplomas in associated sciences or arts programmes have little or no utility for the students unless they enroll in expensive university degree courses. So, after their course gets over, most end up picking low-paying jobs. Instead, they should do specific diplomas in skill-based technical courses such as dental hygiene, lab technician, radiology, plumbing, electrician, carpentry, etc, which remain in high demand and pay you as much as a white collar job here.”\n\n“Most of the students who come to us are interested in taking admission in diploma courses like associated arts or business administration,” says Kamal K Bhumbla of BN Overseass Educational Services, Jalandhar. “We advise them to go for technical or skill-based courses but often they choose courses their friends are also taking up,” adds the immigration consultant. “Unlike earlier, most of the students nowadays are going to Canada in groups.” On lesser number of visas being issued, he says it could be due to backlog but good profile visa applications never get rejected.\n\nThe problem, says Toronto-based community activist Jaspal Bal, is that most of these children, barely out of school, are enrolled in courses that are not academically challenging. Taking a compassionate view of the incidents of misbehaviour by the international students, Bal, whom Indian students approach regarding their issues, feels deportation of kids is not a solution. “The students have come here chasing the dream of permanent residency, just like many others who came here decades back, and who too must have made many such mistakes. They need our help and guidance. We cannot just shun them.” If and when some of these kids are deported, they’ll be a low-hanging fruit for gangsters and other anti-social elements, he says. “It will only scar and break them for life.”\n\nConstable Sarbjit Sangha\n\nThe Tribune Interview\n\nParents should guide, support children\n\nConstable Sarbjit Sangha, media relations officer, Surrey RCMP, talks about the fate of the 40 Indian students who tried to intimidate the police officer and more.

They also tried to stop his car. Our investigation is on. One suspect has already been identified while the identification of others is on. Once the investigation is completed, a detailed report will be forwarded for further action to the Canadian Border Services Agency, which can take a decision on their deportment as well.\n\nHow serious can the charges be?\n\nAccording to the Canadian Criminal Code, two charges will apply: Obstruction of Justice System and Intimidation of Justice System. These are both very serious charges. If you are convicted in court, you will be given a jail sentence of two years and five years, respectively. Depending on how many more such cases these students have been involved in earlier, they can be deported as well. Merely being a spectator or video-taping the incident is not against the law, but whosoever is involved in the act of intentionally stopping the officer’s car will be charged.\n\nHave there been cases of deaths by suicide?\n\nWhile the number of suicides is not very high, it is definitely a matter of concern. International students face a lot of stress. It is more in cases where they don’t have a work permit. I have spoken to many girls who say their parents have sent them to Canada and they will not spend more on them. Any fee, rent or other expenses are to be managed on their own. Many girls, who don’t have work permit, work here on cash, where they are sometimes exploited by the owners. If there’s any sexual assault by the employer, they do not report the matter out of shame. While very few cases come to us, we know such things are happening in our community.\n\nWhat is your message to parents and students?\n\nWhen you send your children to a new country, make them aware of the rules and regulations there, including motor vehicle laws. Your responsibility doesn’t end with sending your child to Canada. When you decide to send your sons or daughters to a foreign country, please make sure you have the financial means to support them till their studies get over.\n\nIf international students are victims of any kind of crime, they should not hesitate to report to the police. We are here to help the Indian community. Also, please keep in mind that every time there is a negative contact with the police, be it related to theft, fight, etc, it gets reported to the immigration department. This can affect your prospects in getting permanent residency.\n\nPhotos: The Tribune, istock\n\nWorry back home For parents in India, diplomatic rows like the one over a pro-Khalistan referendum leaves them with anxiety over the safety of their children. In its advisory to Indian nationals and students in Canada, the Indian government mentions a sharp increase in incidents of hate crimes, sectarian violence and anti-India activities in Canada. Diplomatic tensions could create problems for Indian students. An issue of some worry, say experts, is that Canada has opened its SDS programme to Pakistan students as well. Toronto-based mediaperson Shameel Jasvir says, “We understand parents must be concerned about the safety of their children, but they can be rest assured that there has been no sectarian violence.” Neither in the Vancouver area, says Richmond-based news director Sameer Kaushal, nor Calgary, according to Senator Rishi Nagar, who is presently in India.\n\n#Canada",
    "Revenue Canada wants to tax former Winnipeg CAO and his company on bribe money, court documents reveal": "The Canada Revenue Agency wants former Winnipeg chief administrative officer Phil Sheegl and his company FSS Financial Support Services Inc. to pay taxes on bribe money the company received from the contractor that built the Winnipeg Police Service headquarters, court documents reveal.\n\nThe revenue agency said it was reassessing Sheegl's and FSS's taxes for 2011, according to a court document.\n\nThe CRA says that's because the company received a $200,000 \"secret commission,\" which is considered income that it did not declare, according to a notice of appeal filed by Sheegl on April 19, 2022, in Tax Court of Canada.\n\n\"In failing to report all its income for the 2011 taxation year, the appellant made misrepresentations attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default,\" the attorney general of Canada said in a reply to a separate notice of appeal by FSS, which was also filed on April 19.\n\nThe documents say the money Financial Support Services received came from Mountain Construction — a company controlled by Armik Babakhanians, whose main construction business is Caspian Projects Inc.\n\nThat happened in 2011, two days after Caspian was awarded a contract to build the Winnipeg Police Service headquarters, the documents say.\n\nIn 2020, the City of Winnipeg sued Sheegl, along with a number of other people and companies involved in the police headquarters project, alleging a scheme to defraud taxpayers out of millions of dollars. (Tyson Koschik/CBC)\n\nThe police HQ construction project was later the subject of a five-year RCMP investigation that ended in December 2019 with no charges laid.\n\nDocuments filed in the Tax Court of Canada say Babakhanians, through Mountain Construction, paid FSS a $200,000 cheque marked \"consulting fee\" in July 2011. Sheegl gave half to then Winnipeg mayor Sam Katz and wrote \"loan\" on the cheque.\n\nSheegl \"has no knowledge as to why the payor of the deposit referred to the amount as a 'consulting fee' on the cheque, as the amount was not an income item,\" said the FSS notice of appeal.\n\nIt says the amount was \"sale proceeds from the disposition of part of the interest\" in a share of a piece of undeveloped land in Tartesso, Ariz.\n\nWATCH | A 2017 CBC report on the Arizona land deal:\n\nFSS said it didn't declare the money as income because the money did not belong to the company.\n\nIt said $100,000 was owed to Winnix — an Arizona company owned by Sheegl. The other $100,000 was owed to Duddy Enterprises LLC, an Arizona company owned by Katz, according to FSS.\n\nSheegl says the $200,000 was sent to FSS because it's a Canadian company.\n\nWhile FSS maintains the payment was part of a 2011 real estate deal Sheegl and Katz did with Babakhanians, a Manitoba court called it a \"bribe\" in a ruling delivered earlier this year.\n\nIn January 2020, the City of Winnipeg sued Babakhanians, Sheegl and a number of other people and companies involved in the police HQ project, alleging a scheme to defraud taxpayers out of millions of dollars.\n\nThat lawsuit is still before the courts. However, Sheegl successfully fought to have his case separated from the group.\n\nA 2017 photo shows the raw desert land owned by Phil Sheegl, Sam Katz and their co-investors in Arizona, south of the partially constructed community of Tartesso. (CBC)\n\nIn March 2022, a justice with what was then Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench found Sheegl had accepted a bribe and breached his duty as a city officer when he took $327,200 from Babakhanians, which he split with Katz.\n\nThe money was given to Sheegl and Katz in two payments — the $200,000 Mountain sent to FSS, and $127,200 sent to a Katz company.\n\nSheegl was ordered by the Manitoba court in March to pay the city approximately $1.1 million, which included the bribe money and severance pay. He is currently appealing that decision.\n\nMust pay taxes on money given to Katz: CRA\n\nThe latest court documents say FSS is a consulting business and had reported $28,069 income in 2011, as well as a loss of $121,978 partnership income.\n\nThe attorney general's reply to the FSS appeal says \"$200,000 represents a 1,000 per cent increase over what was reported as consulting revenue.\"\n\nThe Canada Revenue Agency also reassessed Sheegl's personal income taxes on March 7, 2019, to include the $100,000 payment to Katz in 2011. The documents say Sheegl's reported income in 2011 was $208,000, but should have included that money.\n\nThe CRA says in court filings that Sheegl benefited by giving that money to Katz, who was mayor from 2004 to 2014, because he didn't have to pay taxes on it.\n\nSheegl's notice of appeal says the $100,000 payment was not made for his own benefit.\n\n\"The payment was owed to Mr. Katz/Duddy for the portion of the interest that was sold to Mr. Babakhanians,\" said Sheegl's notice of appeal. \"Therefore, the payment is not taxable in the hands of the appellant.\"\n\nIn March 2022, a Manitoba court found that Sheegl, shown here in a file photo, had accepted a bribe and breached his duty as a city officer when he took $327,200 from Winnipeg police headquarters contractor Armik Babakhanians, which he split with former mayor Sam Katz. (CBC)\n\nThe attorney general of Canada said by not reporting all his income in the 2011 tax year, Sheegl \"made misrepresentations attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default\" and should pay penalties as a result.\n\nSheegl has 24 years of experience working in real estate and was associated with eight Arizona-based corporations in 2011, and has an understanding of tax matters, says the attorney general's reply to Sheegl's appeal.\n\n\"The appellant knew, or ought to have known, that his income was understated on his income tax return,\" it says.\n\n'No evidence of negligence': appeal notice\n\nThe court filings also say Katz was not part of the Arizona land deal in 2011, because he hadn't purchased an interest in Duddy Enterprises LLC from Phil Sheegl until March 2012, when he purchased the company for $1.\n\nSheegl \"submits there is no evidence of negligence to justify reopening the 2011 taxation year to reassess in respect of the payment,\" his notice of appeal says.\n\nThe Canada Revenue Agency wouldn't comment on the case.\n\nIn an email to CBC News, CRA media relations spokesperson Etienne Biram said \"the courts provide Canadians with a further independent review of disputed issues, and court decisions serve to clarify the law or resolve disputes between the Canada Revenue Agency\" and taxpayers.\n\nThe attorney general of Canada wouldn't comment on the case.\n\nSheegl's lawyers also declined a request for comment.",

    "Canada’s federal holiday to mourn the Queen leaves a patchwork of confusion": "On Canada’s east and west coasts, schools and government offices will be closed on the day of Queen Elizabeth II’s state funeral. But in the two most populous provinces, employees will be at work – unless they are federal employees. Banks and other federal industries, however, have been given the option to close – or to remain open.\n\nOn Tuesday, the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, declared 19 September a federal holiday. But the ensuing chaos of determining who qualifies for the holiday has left workers confused across the country.\n\nThe prairie province of Saskatchewan will remain open for businesses. In neighbouring Manitoba, only government employees will have the day off. But in Prince Edward Island on the Atlantic coast, a full statutory holiday has been declared, with provincial authorities ordering businesses to close or pay their employees time and a half.\n\n“Declaring an opportunity for Canadians to mourn on Monday is going to be important,” said Trudeau, during a cabinet retreat in the province of New Brunswick – which will close schools and government offices. “For our part we will letting federal employees know that Monday will be a day of mourning where they will not work.”\n\nIn Canada, nearly 90% of workers fall under provincial jurisdiction, and in not declaring the holiday a general holiday, the federal government has left a patchwork of confusion.\n\nNova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador have opted to give workers a public holiday.\n\nQuebec, which has long been skeptical of the monarchy, was the first to rule out a public holiday after Trudeau’s announcement.\n\nOntario, Canada’s most populous province, said workers would not get a holiday – but could instead observe a “moment of silence”.\n\n“This will give all Ontarians an opportunity to reflect on the remarkable life of Queen Elizabeth II and her unrelenting commitment to service and duty,” the premier, Doug Ford, said in a statement.\n\nThe British Columbia premier, John Horgan, said in a statement he would “follow the lead of the federal government and join with other provinces in observing the national day of mourning” – referring to four other provinces that took a similar approach.\n\nOn Wednesday, Toronto’s transit commission announced it too would pay tribute to the late queen on Monday by pausing all service for 96 seconds.\n\nThe commission said the stoppage of subways, buses and streetcars would be part of the city’s “coordinated tribute” to Elizabeth and that service would “resume immediately” after the brief period of silence.\n\nSmall business advocacy groups had been critical of a possible national holiday, arguing the announcement left little time to prepare, arguing a stoppage of work could cost the country billions.\n\nAnd in British Columbia, the teacher’s union said the timing was poor, given an upcoming holiday at the end of September as teachers work to get students settled back in school.\n\n“It’s very unusual to have a part-holiday that only really applies to public sector workers,” Bruce Hallsor of the Monarchist League of Canada told CTV News. “She was everybody’s Queen – she wasn’t only the Queen of public sector workers.”\n\nOnly one province, Alberta, has not yet announced whether it will make the state funeral a public holiday.",
    "Avelo Eyes International Expansion With Mexico, Canada, & Caribbean On The Cards": "Avelo Airlines has been rapidly building its presence in the US domestic market. Its network of more than 30 destinations on both the east and west coasts, often flying into underserved airports, has seen it expand its footprint massively over the past year and a half.\n\nWhile the airline has certainly not exhausted all its options when it comes to domestic connections, flying internationally could well be in its future. Speaking exclusively to Simple Flying, President and CEO of Avelo, Andrew Levy, said that it’s not a question of if, but when. He said,\n\n“We were not actively looking at that, but we absolutely will fly International, it's just a question of when, not if. We are a flag carrier, which means we have all the designations that you need to be able to serve international points on scheduled service. We have lots and lots of experience among our team in terms of international operations. So I do expect that that will come.”\n\nWhere would Avelo fly?\n\nFor Avelo Airlines, any international would need to be a modular progression from its existing hubs and network. It would also need to retain its out-and-back mentality; as yet, Avelo doesn’t fly any route that would leave the plane and crew requiring an overnight stop.\n\nRight now, the airline has a strong presence in the Florida region, with hubs at both Orlando and at Fort Myers. Both of these could open opportunities to the south.\n\nIn the north of the east coast, its original east coast hub airport at Tweed New Haven is far enough north that Canada is entirely doable, without spoiling its out and back in a day strategy. Ottawa, Montreal, Toronto, Hamilton, are all well within the reach of Avelo.\n\nOn the other side of the country, its hub at Hollywood Burbank opens opportunities in both directions. Mexico is just to the south, while to the north, the airline already flies to Pasco Tri-Cities Airport, just a hop and a skip from Vancouver.\n\nLevy agreed with our assessment of its opportunities, stating that,\n\n“For us, international would be … close in, more of a leisure or VFR type focus, which is going to be mostly probably Mexico, Caribbean, those types of things. Certainly, there could be some possibilities in Canada perhaps.”\n\nLong-haul, low-cost doesn’t work\n\nAlthough Avelo could eye some near international destinations to the north and south of the USA, Levy was clear that he has no aspirations to start flying further afield. He said,\n\n“I don't foresee ever deciding to go get really big airplanes that fly across the pond or anything like that. I don't believe in long-haul low-cost - That's not for me. I've never seen it work and someone else will have to prove that one out, one day, maybe…”\n\nPlenty of airlines have had a crack at long-haul, low-cost operations, and plenty have fallen as a result. Those who survive in the longer haul market are either less low-cost than the ULCC that Avelo is – think JetBlue – or they’re flying true LCC services but with long-range narrowbodies – think Wizz Air and some of its A321LR routes.\n\nIt’s always been a tough nut to crack, and for Levy, it’s just a step too far. Nevertheless, we could see some interesting destinations added to the route map in the future that make sense for Avelo to serve.\n\nYou can watch the complete interview with Andrew on the video link below:\n\nWhere would you like to see Avelo landing north or south of the US border?

Storm activity picked up early this month with Danielle and Earl, which formed within a day of each other.\n\nThe links between hurricanes and climate change have become clearer with each passing year. Data shows that hurricanes have become stronger worldwide over the past four decades. A warming planet can expect stronger hurricanes over time and a higher incidence of the most powerful storms — although the overall number of storms may drop, because factors like stronger wind shear could keep some weaker storms from forming.\n\nLast month, scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued an updated forecast for the rest of the season that still predicted an above-normal level of activity",

Direct payments totalling up to $1,300 per child over the next two years (up to $650 per year) would be provided for dental care services. This is the first stage of the government’s plan to deliver dental coverage for families with adjusted net income under $90,000, and will allow children under 12 to receive the dental care they need while the government works to develop a comprehensive national dental care program.\n\nThe one-time top-up to the Canada Housing Benefit would deliver a $500 payment to 1.8 million renters who are struggling with the cost of housing. This more than doubles the government’s Budget 2022 commitment, reaching twice as many Canadians as initially promised. The federal benefit will be available to applicants with an adjusted net income below $35,000 for families, or below $20,000 for individuals, who pay at least 30 per cent of their adjusted net income on rent.\n\nThe Canada Revenue Agency’s (CRA) application portals for the Canada Dental Benefit and Canada Housing Benefit will be available to Canadians following Royal Assent of Bill C-31.\n\nThe legislation tabled in Parliament today represents the latest suite of measures to support Canadians with the rising cost of living without adding fuel to the fire of inflation. The government’s Affordability Plan is delivering targeted and fiscally responsible financial support to the Canadians who need it most, with particular emphasis on addressing the needs of low-income Canadians who are most exposed to inflation.",

A Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP) is for international students who complete an eligible Canadian post-secondary program. Julia Hornstein Aa Accessibility Font Style Serif\n\nSans Font Size A\n\nA\n\nThe Post Graduation Work Permit (PGWP) is an open work permit, meaning it allows the student to work for any employer of their choice in Canada and to work for any Canadian employer without needing a job offer. It allows international student graduates to work anywhere in Canada for up to three years.\n\nSchedule a Free Work Permit Consultation with the Cohen Immigration Law Firm\n\nA major benefit of the PGWP is that it provides international graduates with professional work experience in Canada, which is helpful when PGWP holders go on to apply for Canadian immigration. In general, a PGWP holder needs to gain one year of professional work experience in a National Occupation Classification (NOC) code of 0, A or B to then be eligible to apply for a Canadian permanent residence program.\n\nWhat are the PGWP’s eligibility requirements?\n\nTo be eligible for a PGWP, international students must have:\n\nCompleted studies in an academic, vocational or professional training program that is at least eight months long at an eligible Designated Learning Institution (DLI)\n\nCompleted a study program that led to a degree, diploma or certificate\n\nHeld full time student status in Canada during every academic session of the program of study and included as part of their post-graduation work permit application\n\nObtained a transcript and an official letter from the DLI confirming the applicant has met all requirements to complete their program of study\n\nThe student must also have graduated from:\n\na public post-secondary institution, such as\n\na college\n\na trade or technical school\n\na university\n\nCEGEP (in Quebec)\n\na private post-secondary school (in Quebec) that operates under the same rules as public schools in Quebec;\n\na private secondary or post-secondary school (in Quebec) that offers qualifying programs of 900 hours or longer and results in the issuance of a diplôme d’études professionnelles (DEP) or an attestation de spécialisation professionnelle (ASP); (Note: this will no longer be in effect starting September 2023) or;\n\nCanadian private school that can award degrees under provincial law (for example, Associate, Bachelor’s, Master’s or Doctorate degree) but only if the student was enrolled in a study program that leads to a degree as authorized by the province.\n\nHow long is a PGWP valid for?\n\nA PGWP will be valid for between eight months and three years, depending on the length of the students’ study program. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) provides the following guidelines on its website:\n\nCompleted program under eight months: Not eligible for a PGWP\n\nCompleted program between eight months and less than two years: The PGWP will be valid for the same length of your study program (e.g., a 10-month program will result in a 10-month PGWP)\n\nCompleted program of two years or more: PGWP will be valid for three years\n\nCompleted more than one program: You may be able to combine your Canadian educational programs to get a PGWP as long as the programs are DLI eligible and each over eight months in duration. The total length of the PGWP will correspond to the durations above.\n\nA student must apply for the PGWP within 180 days, or six months, from the time they receive a transcript and official letter from the DLI confirming they have met all the requirements to complete the study program.\n\nStudying overseas and eligibility for a PGWP\n\nIRCC set in place a new policy during the coronavirus pandemic that allows students to complete their Canadian study program while living abroad and still be eligible for a PGWP when they move to Canada. In order to be eligible for this policy, the student must:\n\nBe enrolled at a DLI\n\nHave started or will start a program between spring 2020 and summer 2022, or the program was already in progress by March 2020.\n\nHave a study permit or approval for a study permit, or apply for a study permit prior to starting your program and are eventually approved\n\nMeet all other PGWP criteria\n\nPermanent Residency for International Residents\n\nUnder Express Entry, the Canadian government uses the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) to evaluate each candidate based on their human capital. Canada looks at age, education, language skills, work experience, among other criteria. Usually every two weeks, the Canadian government holds Express Entry draws providing permanent residence invitations to those with the highest CRS scores. Extra points are given to candidates with Canadian education and work experience under Express Entry.\n\nMany international students obtain permanent residence status through the Canadian Experience Class (CEC). With a PGWP, students must go on to obtain at least 1,560 hours of Canadian work experience in a NOC 0, A or B job in order to be apply for permanent residency through CEC. Many Provincial Nominee Programs also cater to international graduates.\n\nIf you have studied in Quebec and would like to settle in the province permanently, a student may also be eligible for immigration under the Quebec Experience Program (PEQ). The PEQ provides a fast-track way for international students and individuals with work experience in Quebec to get a Quebec selection certificate, which is a mandatory step towards permanent residency that is granted by the federal government.\n\nSchedule a Free Work Permit Consultation with the Cohen Immigration Law Firm\n\n© CIC News All Rights Reserved.

    "Australia and Canada descend into mass immigration madness": "In the lead-up to the Jobs & Skills Summit, the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA) urged the Albanese Government to aggressively compete with Canada for migrants:\n\nTemporary skilled migrants now account for around 0.7 per cent of the labour force, less than half the level when temporary skilled migration peaked shortly after the mining boom. The global migration landscape is also changing. Canada significantly increased its permanent migration intake through the pandemic to provide greater certainty to temporary migrants already onshore and send strong signals to prospective future migrants offshore (see Figure 2)…\n\nHome Affairs Minister Clare O’Neil expressed similar sentiments, claiming many of the “best and brightest minds” were choosing to migrate to Canada and other nations instead of Australia. Australia, therefore, needed to compete harder in the “global war for talent”.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese likewise said “we need to be more attractive in the global labour market, particularly for the skills that we need, and one way to do that is to provide people with a path to permanent residency and that’s what we intend to do”.\n\nThe comparisons with Canada are curious, given the nation’s extreme immigration program has been blamed for Canada’s lackluster wage growth:\n\nThe country’s GDP may be expanding but individual Canadians aren’t getting ahead… Why, when the country’s GDP is expanding, have individual Canadians not been getting ahead? Why is their wage growth projected to lag so far behind citizens of other nations? And why are millennials taking the brunt of it? “Past generations of young Canadians entering the workforce could look forward to favourable tailwinds lifting real incomes during their working lives. That’s no longer the case”… “Rather, they face a long period of stagnating average real incomes that will last most of their working lives” [said David Williams, policy analyst for the Business Council of B.C.]… Ottawa’s economic strategy is based on several “shaky pillars,” which include using “record immigration levels to turbo-charge population growth and housing demand in major cities,” Williams said. “The political class appears to have lost interest in efforts to raise workers’ productivity and real wage growth through higher business investment per worker”… The Liberals’ commitment to record immigration targets focuses mostly “on the benefits immigrants provide to older Canadians,” [Analyst Stephen Punwasi] said, including in the form of “strong housing demand and tax revenues.” But he cautions that Ottawa’s policies often exploit newcomers, who end up coming to the country unaware of flat wages, especially for the young adults who make up the bulk of immigrants, foreign students and temporary workers… Donald Wright, the freshly retired head of B.C.’s provincial civil service, notes discouragingly that six out of 10 Canadians recently told Nanos pollsters they expect their standard of living to worsen. “Isn’t it time we took Canadians standard of living seriously?” Wright asks… Policymakers are over-relying on population growth and cheap labour. It’s not helping the middle classes, he says.\n\nA separate article argues that a “rush of low-skilled foreign labour” is killing Canadian wages, while forcing up the cost of housing for young Canadians:\n\nVoters can thank Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for handing certain business lobbyists what they eagerly seek: A huge supply of low-skilled temporary foreign workers to fill jobs in supermarkets, coffee shops, kitchens, hotels, construction and residential care, for which some bosses don’t want to pay serious wages… There has been a 65 per cent increase in guest workers arriving into Canada in 2019 compared to 2015, when the Liberals were elected… And while [former Prime Minister] Harper once restricted temporary foreign workers to 10 per cent of certain sectors, and allowed them only in regions where unemployment is under six per cent, the Liberals have done away with those limits even for temporary foreign workers, say Lange et al in a Policy Options article titled, “The economic case against low-wage temporary foreign workers”… Foreign student numbers at the end of last year stood at 621,000. That’s a five-fold increase since 2000. Most apply for three-year work permits following graduation. Their presence is felt most strongly on the job and rental markets in Canada’s big cities, where educational facilities are concentrated… About one in six foreign students in Canada, or more than 100,000, attend schools in Metro Vancouver, where the majority also work, typically in the service and hospitality sectors. Many put up with the low wages because Ottawa portrays it as a prime route to permanent resident status… Instead of employers relying on “a ready source of cheap labour” from outside the country to fill low-paying jobs, the economists advance the supply and demand concept that employers who have trouble finding workers should instead lure them by paying more, offering better conditions and hiking productivity through innovation.\n\nAs we know, the Albanese Government used the Jobs & Skills Summit as a trojan horse to open the temporary and permanent immigration floodgates, in a bid to compete with nations like Canada in the “global war for talent”.\n\nMuch like Canada, the Albanese Government will flood the labour market with lower-skilled and lower-paid foreign workers, in turn lifting the unemployment rate, killing wage growth, and worsening housing affordability.\n\nWhy do centre-left governments like the Trudeau and Albanese administrations hate the working class so much?\n\nWith friends like them, the working class sure doesn’t need enemies.",
    "How age is a big factor for immigration applicants to Canada": "Canada is credited for having one of the world’s most immigrant-friendly policies, ranking fourth internationally in the Migrant Integration Policy Index. But the criteria used to prioritize applicants based on age leaves many at a disadvantage, even though they might have the qualifications Canada is looking for.\n\nWith immigration backlogs and several technical glitches on the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) online portal during the pandemic, many have become ineligible for certain programs that consider age as a criterion.\n\nWhen Pedro Carvalho arrived with his wife in 2017 from Brazil, the couple was in their 30s.\n\nBut after missing the Express Entry (EE) draw this year because of a technical glitch, Carvalho was skeptical about meeting the CRS cut-off score due to his age.\n\nAfter the resumption of EE draws in July 2022, the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score has been on the higher end (above 500 points) in comparison to pre-pandemic levels, touching 557 on July 6th.\n\nWith high cut-off scores at the time, many like Carvalho were pessimistic and switched to another program called temporary resident to permanent resident program (TR to PR) to ensure they can stay in Canada as permanent residents.\n\n“Now I turned 40, so I lost points. To be honest I don't know what else I can say,” Carvalho said in an email to CTVNews.ca in August.\n\nRick Lamanna, director at Fragomen Canada, an immigration services provider, told CTVNews.ca in a phone interview that it can be frustrating for certain applicants waiting in the pool.\n\n“They see themselves losing points every year because of these delays. They may have fewer points than they did a couple of years ago or even a year ago,” he said.\n\nAt first glance, age is not highlighted as a major criterion by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).\n\nBut for certain programs—such as the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP) or Canadian Experience Class (CEC)— the importance of being young becomes quite explicit, especially for applicants touching the 40s threshold.\n\nA DEEPER LOOK AT THE POINT-BASED SYSTEM\n\nPrograms under EE include the FSWP, Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP), CEC, and a portion of the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP). An applicant needs to be eligible for one of the above to enter the EE pool of candidates.\n\nCanadian employers typically rely on EE designed to attract highly skilled foreign workers through its programs that lead to permanent residency (PR) and among these, FSWP, and the CEC are popular—both of which consider age as one of the core/human capital factors.\n\nLamanna says, while age can drop the score of a CEC or FSWP candidate, other factors can help raise CRS scores.\n\n“However,” he said, “It is very difficult. Because applicants in their 40s lose a lot of points on age relative to people in their 20s or 30s.”\n\nCRS is a points-based system that scores a profile to rank applicants in the Express Entry pool. To get an invitation to apply (ITA), the candidate should meet a score above the CRS score.\n\nThe maximum score in CRS is 1200 and this evaluation is based on several characteristics such as level of education, English/French skills, and work experience. If an applicant doesn't meet the CRS score in a specific draw, he/she has to upload their profile again to be considered for the next pool.\n\nPOINT DROP FOR OLDER APPLICANTS\n\nUnder the CRS score, candidates can get a higher score if they are single and fall under the Express Entry category. However, the score falls dramatically for those above the age of 44. Canada’s comprehensive ranking system gives no points to those above 45 years of age.\n\nNot only that, starting from the age of 40, the points reduce by 10 versus 5 before the age of 40. While a 29-year-old can get a maximum of 110 CRS points for age, an applicant of a similar caliber approaching their 30th birthday may see a sharp decline. By the time they reach 39, just 55 points are available, and by the time they reach 45, there are no points.\n\nUnder FSWP, the applicant’s age is worth 12 per cent of the overall selection criteria on the selection grid. The FAQ section makes it clear that someone over the age of 47 will not get any points under the Age factor of the CRS, but may get points on other factors such as job offer, skills, and language abilities.\n\nDOES CANADA NEED YOUNG WORKERS?\n\nImmigration has played a critical role in Canada’s economy, providing a relatively young stream of workers. More than 80% of the immigrants admitted in recent years have been under 45 years old.\n\nAccording to a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), young immigrants are generally much more educated than immigrants nearing retirement and this is true for those entering the labour force.\n\nWith an aging native-born labour force and low fertility rates (roughly 1.4 births per woman in 2020), an inflow of immigrants has become increasingly important for Canada. The country suffers a shortage of skilled workers despite attempts to attract immigrants. According to the data from Statistics Canada, immigrants account for a little over one-quarter of Canadian workers.\n\nRecent census data from 2021 shows that people nearing retirement outnumber those who are too old to enter the labour market in Canada. Additionally, rural populations are also aging faster than those in urban areas – partially due to the lower influx of immigrants.\n\nThe Canadian population is seeing a big shift, with baby boomers getting older, according to a report by Statistics Canada. The shift will have significant consequences on the labour market, services to seniors, and the consumption of goods and services.\n\nA recent Census report by Statistics Canada shows that young immigrants are helping boost numbers in Canada’s population growth. Millennials (born between 1981 and 1996) were between 25 and 40 years old in 2021, and are already the fastest-growing generation. In Canada, their numbers rose 8.6 per cent between 2016 and 2021 due to immigration, according to the StatsCan report.\n\nBut when it comes to the age factor in economic immigration, Canada is not alone.\n\nAustralia has age as one of the selection criteria for permanent residency and the age of the applicant should be below 45 years to apply for a PR visa. Germany recently introduced its version of the “green card” (known as Chancenkarte) to meet the country’s growing labour shortage. Three of the four criteria to be considered for the program include that applicant is below the age of 35.\n\nBUT TARGETED DRAWS IN 2023 COULD BE A GAMECHANGER\n\nLamanna says as 2023 approaches, applicants need to brace themselves for specified targeted draws, which are designed to address the labour shortage that Canada currently faces in certain sectors.\n\nThe recently passed Bill C-19 allows invitations to those applicants under Express Entry that support the regional economic needs. The training, education, experience, and responsibilities (TEER) system would allow IRCC to invite applicants based on occupation, language or education rather than the traditional CRS score.\n\n“While the issue of age is currently important, a bigger issue will be what happens when targeted draws occur,” he said. If someone is not in the pool of that specific occupation type, then applicants may be left in limbo and these could include those with higher CRS scores.\n\nLamanna said provinces have more autonomy in selecting people in certain occupations to help employers in certain jurisdictions. There is a risk-reward to targeted draws. It helps meet the labour shortage in specific industries such as health care, manufacturing and construction.\n\n“The risk is there are people in the queue who know that at some point, they will be selected as long as they meet the CRS score. But if a minister shifts to occupation-based selective selection process, then people may be left wondering when their turn will come next,” Lamanna said.",
    "Canada annual inflation rate slows to 7.0% in August": "TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's annual inflation rate eased more than expected to 7.0% in August, largely on lower gasoline prices and slowing shelter costs, Statistics Canada said on Tuesday. But grocery prices rose at their fastest pace since August 1981.\n\nAnalysts polled by Reuters had expected the annual rate to fall to 7.3% in August from 7.6% in July.\n\nSTORIES:\n\nMarket reaction: CAD/\n\nLink:https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/220920/dq220920a-eng.htm\n\nCOMMENTARY\n\nJIMMY JEAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST AT DESJARDINS GROUP\n\n\"I think (the Bank of Canada) is still going to do at least 50 basis points in October. I think it might raise a debate as to whether you're going to pursue with another rate hike in December. If we continue to see those trends, really that would make a case for them to start dialing down the rate hikes. But it's really going to be dependent on the data. We still expect inflation to remain above 6%... by the end of the year. So we're going to need to see a combination of factors such as wage pressures ebbing and continued improvement in supply chains.\n\nANDREW GRANTHAM, SENIOR ECONOMIST, CIBC CAPITAL MARKETS\n\n\"Canadian inflation decelerated further in August, and unlike the prior month the move wasn't just a story of lower gasoline prices.\"\n\n\"Even after today's deceleration, the annual rate of inflation remains well above the Bank of Canada's target and as such further interest rate hikes are still in the cards. However, a clearer gap appears to be opening up between Canadian and US inflation trends, which should bring a lower peak (for interest rate) from the Bank of Canada than the Federal Reserve.\"\n\nMICHAEL GREENBERG, SVP AND PORTFOLIO MANAGER, FRANKLIN TEMPLETON INVESTMENT SOLUTIONS\n\n\"It probably suggests to the Bank of Canada that hikes are starting to work but they are by no means done. It has maybe taken down some of the risk of a supersized rate hike in Canada in October but clearly there is still more wood to chop and we think that central banks, including the Bank of Canada, are still going to be pretty singularly focused on the inflation fight and getting inflation under control and down to closer to their target.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nANDREW KELVIN, CHIEF CANADA STRATEGIST AT TD SECURITIES\n\n\"A downside surprise is better than an upside surprise where the Bank of Canada's concerned. If you look at where the core CPI metrics are, they look like they are slightly lower on average than they were previous month. So again, that's a positive thing for the Bank of Canada. But the big picture here is still that we're talking about a CPI that is growing at 7% year-over-year. It's still a highly inflationary environment, from the Bank of Canada's perspective. So it still is going to require additional rate hikes, I don't know that this is going to change their (Bank of Canada's) thinking in the very near term. Though it does speak to the fact that inflation is decelerating, we have seen a peak in inflation, and they could probably afford to be a little bit more careful if they were so inclined.\"\n\n\"I think ultimately the really important thing will be the evolution of inflation expectations, which we will have more information on when we get the Business Outlook Survey and Canadian survey of consumer expectations in October.\"\n\n\"TD's forecast for interest rate increases this year is \"another 50 (basis points) this year, and then we have one more in January to get them 4%. But my view here is that now we're in restrictive territory, the safest course of action is to slow down. I think they've front loaded enough and can revert back to the normal 25 basis point course of tightening. Having said all that, if the market demands a 50 basis point move, I don't think the Bank of Canada can disappoint the market.\"\n\n(Reporting by Steve Scherer, Fergal Smith; Editing by Denny Thomas)",

    "‘Canada is in mourning,’ says Justin Trudeau after death of Queen": "Justin Trudeau has expressed his condolences over the death of Queen Elizabeth II, telling reporters that that monarch, who was also Canada’s head of state, was “one of my favourite people in the world”.\n\n“In a complicated world, her steady grace and resolve brought comfort and strength to us all. Canada is in mourning,” said Trudeau, who first met the Queen as a child when his father Pierre was prime minister.\n\nAfter Buckingham Palace announced the Queen had died at 96, tributes poured in from Canadian officials.\n\nBut her death is also likely to prompt fresh questions over the role of the monarchy in today’s Canada, where support for the institution has dropped steadily in recent years.\n\n“Canadians across the country will mourn the loss of the Queen. Let us take a moment to honour Her Majesty’s memory in each of our own ways,” said Mary Simon, the governor general, who represents the monarch in Canada.\n\n“When I was growing up, my grandmother revered the Queen as did many in the Arctic. She would tell her stories about Her Majesty, about her role and her commitment,” Simon said in a later statement, alluding to her early life in the Canadian north.\n\nAs the first ever Indigenous governor general, Simon has often reflected on the monarchy’s role in Canada, its complicated relationship with colonialism – and the legacy that still holds for Indigenous communities today.\n\nPolitical leaders who have previously criticized the monarchy drew a sharp distinction for the late monarch, praising Elizabeth for her life of public service.\n\nJustin Trudeau speaks after the Queen’s death on Thursday. Photograph: Jennifer Gauthier/Reuters\n\n“Queen Elizabeth II lived a life of history and duty. She was also a mother, grandmother and great-grandmother,” the New Democratic party leader, Jagmeet Singh, wrote in a statement. “My thoughts today are for her family who have lost a pillar of strength in their lives.”\n\nThe leader of the francophone separatist Bloc Québécois extended condolences to Elizabeth’s family and the UK.\n\n“She will have been at the heart of a troubled century with the desire to be a positive force there,” wrote Yves-François Blanchet.\n\nIn Ottawa, the Canadian flag atop parliament’s Peace Tower was lowered to half-mast, as were flags at federal buildings across the country.\n\nFollowing the news of the monarch’s death, residents in the nation’s capital began gathering outside Rideau Hall, the residence of the governor general, to pay tribute.\n\nAs head of state, Elizabeth II had a long connection to Canada. She was also the first monarch to open a session of Canada’s parliament in person, delivering the speech from the throne in 1957.\n\nTwelve of Canada’s 23 prime ministers have served under her. Over the years, she made 22 visits to Canada on royal tours, the first in 1951, when she was still a princess, and the most recent in 2010, where she visited five cities in nine days.\n\n“My pride in the country remains undimmed,” she told supporters in Halifax as she wrapped up her tour.\n\nGovernance in Canada is largely expected to carry on as usual, with the monarch remaining the constitutional head of state in Canada – no matter the individual in the role.\n\nIn a citizenship swearing-in ceremony where new Canadians, up until hours ago, were required to swear allegiance to the Queen, the judge overseeing the event told attendees “the monarch is now King Charles III, King of Canada”.\n\nWhile the death of Elizabeth II will require a number of bureaucratic changes, it is also likely to renew scrutiny of the monarchy as a whole.\n\nPrecipitated in part by the tumultuous exit of Canada’s governor general last year, recent polls found Canadians questioning the need for a constitutional monarchy. More than half of respondents believe the royal family is no longer relevant.\n\nA royal as head of state for Canada is constitutionally entrenched, and any changes to the status quo would require constitutional changes assented to by the provinces."
