    "Ready to die for Latvia?": "Editor’s note: Our world is complex. The Global Watchdawg fetches events from across the globe, aims to build relevance to the UW community, and strives for action through the lens of geopolitical pragmatism.\n\nThrough the window of a bus, while staring at old Soviet mid-rise apartments, I reminisced about the last six weeks I spent speaking Russian with my host family, discussing furniture choices over tea, playing “Durak,” and watching the entire dubbed version of “Shutter Island” without English subtitles.\n\nWhile all of this was occurring, Ukrainian civilians in Izium were being killed, tortured, and buried in mass graves by Russian soldiers about 850 miles southwest of me.\n\nUpon my arrival to the United States, the news worsened — Putin had ordered a partial mobilization of those in Russia’s military reserve.\n\nNot to mention, renewed conflicts between Azerbaijan and Armenia continue to take lives, and border conflicts between Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan are reaching a death toll of 100.\n\nOver which, Russia has, ironically, urged a peaceful and diplomatic de-escalation.\n\nPoorly drawn Soviet borders, internal politics in the Collective Security Treaty Organization, and a weakening Russian influence over the area have all contributed to this Balkan powder keg-esque situation in a post-colonial space.\n\nMy experience abroad was not in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, or Tajikistan — nor was it in Russia.\n\nMy home base was in Latvia’s second largest city, Daugavpils, located just 75 miles from the Latvia-Russian border. Well within the bounds of NATO protection, the city houses an approximately 80% native Russian-speaking population.\n\nFrom there, I traveled through Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia, studying the Baltic countries and their long, dark history with Soviet occupation.\n\nUnfortunately, my excursion doesn’t even begin to capture the full extent of Soviet imperialization. In fact, every single country mentioned thus far has been a Soviet republic.\n\nThe aforementioned Daugavpils sits in an interesting cultural and political environment, due to the fact that it’s ethnically Russian, but also Latvian, by nationality.\n\nIn the city center, I could see Ukrainian flags being flown outside homes, but when talking to older citizens, there was a clear hesitation about discussing the war in Ukraine.\n\nMany of the folks I conversed with declared that the war is “bad for both sides” and remained lukewarm. While not factually incorrect, there is a clear aggressor in this war.\n\nIt would be unfair to characterize Daugavpils as pro-Russia, as it actually leans pro-Ukraine. However, during my time abroad, I’ve learned that leaning pro-Ukraine doesn’t cut it anymore.\n\nThis “Daugavpils effect” is something I worry about on our own campus.\n\n“It’s better to be on the map with positive views,” Māris Selga, ambassador of Latvia to the United States, said. “But in many ways, the war in Ukraine has put us on the map for completely different reasons.”\n\nHow many more countries need to first appear on the news in bloody conflicts before UW students can place them on a map? How many more “unpredictable” wars need to start before there is more proactive action rather than vapid performative reaction?\n\nCarl Larson, a soldier from Seattle who fought in the International Legion of Defense of Ukraine and organizer of Friends of Ukraine’s Military, expressed his anger.\n\n“This pisses me off … Most of my fellow Amercians seem to not care,” Larson said. “This was an opportunity to show my fellow Americans, with my own body, my own life, how important it is for us. It’s still our fight.”\n\nLarson is, arguably, absolutely right. While Larson’s choice is one potential avenue for activism, at an absolute, bare minimum we should be getting educated on this topic.\n\nThe next step for UW students who live in Seattle is to send a letter to Rep. Jayapal and encourage her to be more firm on her support of Ukraine with President Biden.\n\nIf you don’t live in Jayapal’s district, this site can help you identify your representative.\n\nDiplomacy is always the best first option. But as it stands right now, Ukraine needs continued military, humanitarian, and political support from the United States.\n\n“When dealing with a great power, the one thing you don’t do is appease,” George Beebe, former director of the CIA’s Russian analysis and staff advisor to former Vice President Dick Cheney, said. “Show that easy conquest will not be achieved.”\n\nIn this regard, Ukraine has been successful. Many thought that Kyiv would be taken in a matter of days. But fortunately, massive international support has shown leaders in the Kremlin that war is, and always will be, costly.\n\nAs we pass the 200 day mark, political fatigue and apathy become culprits of inaction. I urge UW students to possess the same level of energy and grit they had earlier this year on Feb. 22.\n\n“If we don’t stop Putin in Ukraine, his success there will embolden China, North Korea, and every malevolent dictator in the world,” Larson said.\n\nZelensky has consistently outlined his demands, which include the reunification of Crimea, which had been annexed by Russia in 2014, into Ukrainian borders and reparations before peace talks.\n\nCrimea is considered by Russia to be Russian soil. If Zelensky isn’t bluffing with these demands and pushes forth with military action, this will mean a perceived invasion from Ukraine by Russia.\n\nIt is quite likely that there will be a quick and explosive response. Regardless, enabling unbridled aggression of a sovereign nation like Ukraine isn’t the M.O., we should be pursuing it.\n\nDespite Ukrainian counter-offensive success in Kharkiv and Kherson, Putin seems willing to bind his legacy to a brutal war of attrition.\n\n“If the freedoms and liberties deteriorate or are taken away from the more remote corners of the world … this is certainly something that will harm and affect the other guys,” Kristjan Prikk, ambassador of Estonia to the United States, said.\n\nThe longer this war goes on, the worse it gets, the more likely a full-blown world war will break out, and it’s not too extreme to say that it may include the United States.\n\n“Most NATO members are not ready for war with Russia,” Steven Pifer, former ambassador of the United States to Ukraine, said.\n\nThis is the unfortunate truth. Many NATO countries that border Russia like Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Poland, Norway, and Finland will rely heavily on U.S. support if push comes to shove.\n\nThe United States, of course, has already been leagues ahead in its support of Ukraine.\n\nThough a world war is unlikely, it is worth noting that the countries we owe a defensive obligation to are much more connected to us than we think — and that includes Daugavpils.\n\nAfter the bus took off on our last day of formal study, the words of a young, patriotic Latvian echoed in my head.\n\n“I am ready to die for Latvia,” she said.\n\nAre you?\n\nReach writer Raj Kumar at opinion@dailyuw.com.

    "Sewage monitoring indicates a surge of Covid-19 spread in Latvia": "Sewage monitoring data for some of Latvia’s cities indicates an increase of coronavirus concentration, which indicates a surge of the spread of Covid-19, as reported on Twitter by Latvian Biomedical Research and Study Centre representative Dita Gudra.\n\nSeptember’s monitoring data indicates increased concentration of the virus in sewer water in Riga, Jurmala, Liepaja and Jelgava. Measurements in Liepaja, however, show signs of stabilisation and reduced concentration of the virus.\n\nA sharp surge is reported in Ventspils, which contradicts data reported by the Disease Prevention and Control Centre (SPKC).\n\nIn Valmiera and Jekabpils there is an increase of coronavirus concentration reported, which indicates increased spread of the infection.\n\nA sharp increase of concentration of the virus is observed in Tukums as well, where measurements are on a sharp rise. The situation in Salaspils also indicates increased concentration of Covid-19.\n\nIn all Latvian municipalities surveyed the dominant Covid-19 variant is Omicron sub-variant BA4/5, which is found in more than 95% of cases.\n\nAs previously reported, Latvia has adopted a system to monitor SARS-CoV-2 particles in sewer water in order to predict outbreaks of the virus in populated areas.\n\nThe research included BIOR, Riga Technical University’s Water Research and Environmental Biotechnology Laboratory and Latvian Biomedical Research and Study Centre.\n\nAccording to information published on BIOR website, sewer monitoring plays an important role in viral epidemiology. Analysis of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus in samples taken from sewage systems provides additional information to SPKC and other health institutions in order to predict and observe dynamics of the spread of the virus.\n\nThe advantage of this monitoring approach is that it is possible to determine the presence of infected people who have and don’t have symptoms in a municipality.\n\nCollection of sewage samples from centralised systems is done twice a week. These samples are then delivered to BIOR and Latvian Biomedical Research and Study Centre, which analyse those samples for presence of SARS-CoV-2 particles and viral RNA. Samples are tested for other public health related particles.",
    "Latvia persists in granting independence to its Orthodox Church": "Riga intervenes in church affairs by declaring Latvian church independent from Moscow\n\nThe Latvian state declared the Orthodox Church in the country to be independent.

    "Latvia plans to purchase fewer than ten HIMARS rocket systems": "RIGA - Latvia plans to purchase fewer than ten high mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS), Defense Minister Artis Pabriks (Development/For) said at the Spilve Airfield on Monday.\n\nAt the end of July, LETA was told at the Defense Ministry that Latvia had requested from the United States information on the availability and prices of HIMARS systems. This is a joint Baltic states' project and the Defense Ministry expects the US to support it with co-funding.\n\nOn Monday, two HIMARS systems were delivered to the Spilve Aifield and Liepaja Airport in Latvia by US military transport aircraft for a training exercise. A US plane with a HIMARS on board landed at Spilve also last October.\n\nAs he welcomed the HIMARS systems at the Spilve Airfield, Pabriks indicated that in accordance with the decisions taken at the NATO Summit in Madrid and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's recent visit to Latvia, the US' military presence in Latvia will become more visible and stronger.\n\nAlthough Pabriks did not elaborate on the schedule or price of the purchase, he said that Latvia will likely buy the high precision artillery rocket systems in less than five years. He also said that Latvia will buy slightly fewer than ten systems.",
    "Moscow Losing Another Nation’s Orthodox Church—This Time Latvia’s": "Since 1991, when the Soviet Union collapsed and the Orthodox faithful and leaders in the former Soviet republics and formerly occupied Baltic countries began to press for independence from the Moscow Patriarchate, the Russian Orthodox Church and equally the Russian government have been worried about these efforts and worked hard to oppose them. This anxiety was further exacerbated in January 2019 when the Ecumenical Patriarch granted autocephaly to the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, which cost Moscow its largest presence abroad (Novayagazeta.ru, March 27). Indeed, the Moscow Patriarchate is clearly in retreat almost everywhere in the former Soviet space, a retreat that has increased in speed given the Kremlin’s all-out aggression in Ukraine (see EDM, August 12, 2021). Now, Moscow is in the process of losing control over yet another national Orthodox church—this time in the Republic of Latvia.\n\nOn September 5, Latvian President Egils Levits called for the Seimas (Latvia’s parliament) to give the Latvian Orthodox Church autocephaly and thus formalize its complete independence from Moscow. Three days later, the country’s parliament passed a law that requires the Latvian Orthodox Church to bring its statute into conformity with the new law by October 31 and thus become independent from Moscow (Eng.lsm.lv, September 5; Meduza, September 5). The parliament acted so quickly because, according to Levits, such a change was required for Latvia’s national security given the long history of Moscow using Orthodox churches abroad for political purposes (Orthodoxtimes.com, September 10).\n\nNot surprisingly, the Moscow Patriarchate and Kremlin media have reacted with fury. Archpriest Nikolay Balashov, an adviser to Moscow Patriarch Kirill, said this was a most unhappy development because Latvia’s constitution proclaims the separation of church and state. Balashov also characterized the move as totally unnecessary because the Latvian Orthodox Church has been self-administrating since 1992. He said it was a return to the medieval principle of cujus regio, ejus religio, which held that the ruler of a country determines its religion. Moreover, he made clear that, since the state has no right to grant autocephaly, Moscow has no intention of recognizing Riga’s action and that no other Orthodox church should either (Interfax-religion.ru, September 8; Stoletie.ru, September 9).\n\nMeanwhile, commentaries in pro-Kremlin media were even more emotional. One in Vzglyad, for example, labeled Latvia’s move as “completely fantastic and unprecedented in world practice” (Vzglyad, September 5). More independent Russian outlets were more cautious and apparently more accepting of something they consider inevitable in the current environment (Nezavisimaya gazeta, September 9).\n\nThe proximate cause of what Latvia has done lies in Ukraine, both in Russia’s war there and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate’s declaration of independence from Moscow because of the war and the earlier grant of autocephaly to the competing Orthodox Church of Ukraine. All this has echoed throughout Orthodox churches in the former Soviet republics and formerly occupied Baltic countries, which, in Soviet times, and in some earlier cases, were subordinate to Moscow. But Riga’s latest move is also the product of uniquely Latvian concerns about ending arrangements that its people and government see as surviving from the time of Soviet occupation, and they have good reason to believe Moscow has and will again use these arrangements to compromise Latvia’s independence.\n\nLike most things connected with the Russian Orthodox Church, its situation in Latvia has been both complex and murky. In 1921, after Latvia gained independence, the Russian Orthodox Church recognized the Latvian Orthodox Church as autonomous, but the Riga church remained nominally subordinate to the Moscow Patriarchate. In 1936, following the Soviet assassination of the head of the Orthodox Church in Latvia, the Ecumenical Patriarchate recognized the Latvian Orthodox Church as part of its dominion. The Soviets suppressed that arrangement when they occupied Latvia during World War II; but in December 1992, after Latvia regained independence, the Latvian Orthodox Church again became autonomous but did not depart from the canonical territory of the Moscow Patriarchate. That was not a program many Latvians welcomed because Moscow retained the right to appoint the church’s head and the Latvian church was required to follow Moscow’s decisions (Apn.ru, September 7).\n\nTensions regarding this have only increased over the past decade and have exploded since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his expanded invasion of Ukraine, an action Latvia has vehemently opposed. First of all, the Latvian government has published records from Soviet times showing that the metropolitan of the Latvian Orthodox Church was a KGB agent. Second, the Seimas passed a law requiring that the heads of all churches in Latvia must be Latvian citizens, something the Orthodox ones had not been but eventually conceded to despite fears in Moscow that it was giving up too much (Nezavisimaya gazeta, October 1, 2019). And third, the hitherto microscopic Latvian Orthodox Autonomous Church has begun to attract more followers and has become at least potentially a genuine competitor to the Latvian Orthodox Church, which has just over 100 parishes and a claimed membership of 350,000 (see EDM, October 17, 2019).\n\nGiven the small size of Latvia and the Latvian Orthodox Church, some may be inclined to dismiss this latest development as little more than a tempest in a teapot. But three primary reasons point to why that would be a mistake. First, Moscow has shown its willingness to use its church in Latvia to mobilize ethnic Russians against the regime and can be expected to do so in the coming weeks, thus creating another problem for Riga. Second, the Latvian action, one by the state regarding religion, may provide a model for other governments in the post-Soviet space to take similar actions, thus accelerating the departure of Orthodox churches from Moscow’s supervision—or at a minimum raising the battle of this possibility to government levels. And third, this Latvian action, coming as it does during the course of Putin’s war in Ukraine, will only intensify fissiparousness (cleavages) within the Orthodox world generally and indeed within Christianity as a whole regarding relations with Moscow by highlighting the unfortunate history of the Kremlin using the church for anything but religious ends.",
    "Latvia Calls on Republic of South Africa to Facilitate Entry Conditions for Its Citizens": "The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Latvia, Edgars Rinkēvičs, has urged the Republic of South Africa (RSA) to apply easier entry conditions for citizens of Latvia.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThrough a press release on September 25, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also states that South Africa should consider applying for citizens of Latvia to have the same entry conditions as most citizens of the European Union, SchengenVisaInfo.com reports.\n\nIn addition, the Ministry explained that this would make it possible for citizens of Latvia to stay in RSA without visas for up to 90 days.\n\n“On September 24, 2022, in New York, during the 77th session of the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Latvia, Edgars Rinkēvičs, met with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of South Africa (RSA), Naledi Pandor. The Ministers discussed bilateral relations, relations between the EU and the Republic of South Africa, and cooperation in international organizations,” the statement reads.\n\nIn this regard, Minister Rinkēvičs said that he hopes that the planned political consultations between the Foreign Ministries in Pretoria next October will provide an opportunity to identify areas of cooperation of common interest.\n\nAccording to him, Latvia is interested in developing business contacts in information technology, education and science, as well as in the logistics and transport sector, thus taking advantage of the benefits of Latvia’s ports and airports.\n\n“The signing of a convention on the prevention of double taxation, an air transport agreement, or a memorandum on economic cooperation would facilitate unlocking cooperation potential,” he also noted.\n\nAs the Ministry explains, the Ministers also exchanged positions regarding the war in Ukraine at the meeting. At the same time, the Latvian Foreign Minister said that for the first time in 2025, Latvia would be a candidate in the elections for the United Nations Security Council for the 2026-2027 mandate.\n\nMoreover, in 2015 Latvian exports to South Africa amounted to €6.9 million or 0.1 per cent of Latvia’s total exports, mainly wood and wooden articles, machinery, mechanisms and electrical equipment and vehicles.\n\nOn the other hand, imports from South Africa reached €1.0 million or 0.01 per cent of Latvia’s total imports, which included food, chemical and plant products. In addition, South Africa had no Latvian investments during this period. However, some small foreign direct investment of South Africa in Latvia of €33.1200 in 2016.",

    "48 road deaths in eight months of this year in Latvia": "The results of a survey conducted this year show that nearly a quarter or 24% of drivers say they have undergone risky overtaking maneuvers. The data also show that risky maneuvers are more frequently carried out by young drivers aged 18 to 24. More than half, or 59% of respondents, say they have experienced risky overtaking maneuvers: 43% as car passengers, 4% on an intercity bus, and 12% both in a car and an intercity bus.\n\nWhile 85% of drivers assess their overall level of knowledge in road traffic management as generally good, 61% of drivers say they have violated road traffic rules over the last year.\n\nOf the 48 deaths on state roads this year, 20 were killed in collisions, eight as a result of the car tipping over, one killed in a collision with an animal, four were pedestrians, ten killed in driving into an obstacle, and three into a vehicle standing on the road. One person lost his life driving into a pond, and another died under 'other circumstances'.\n\nPhoto: LVC\n\nThis year, the number of cyclist deathss has fallen: ten cyclists lost their lives on the state roads in 2021, but this year there has been one incident, where a cyclist died after crashing into a parked vehicle.\n\nFirefighters rescued 88 people from cars and removed 28 dead. Last year, 149 people were rescued and 45 dead were removed.\n\nThe State Fire and Rescue Service (VUGD) asks residents to stop if they see a road accident, to assess the situation and, if necessary, to call the emergency call number 112 immediately.\n\nThe VUGD has observed that, unfortunately, the tendency to film and photograph accidents is not diminishing. “The sight of spectators gathering at the scene of the accident makes it seem like someone must have called 112. Unfortunately, we occasionally face the situation of eyewitnesses filming, photographing, and commenting on the crash, but no one has thought about informing the rescue services. If there are victims of an accident, the timely lack of assistance may end up tragically. Therefore, it is always important to call 112 immediately. Then it is better to give victims emotional support, not to film and photograph,” said the VUGD representative Jānis Grīnbergs.\n\nLatvia's road are consistently ranked as among the most dangerous in Europe.",
    "Latvia exposes NATO’s sham victory against Russia": "The Zelensky regime seems to be overjoyed by their recent supposed counteroffensive against the Russians. To tell you the truth, Moscow’s recent retreat on the battleground in some areas of Ukraine has been misunderstood to be Putin’s weakness.\n\nStill, it looks like NATO was indeed overjoyed by the development until Putin cleared his motive behind the war and now the baltic state Latvia has solidified the Russian’s position of strength.\n\nLatvia Knows Moscow better than the west\n\nThe Latvian cabinet recently approved suggestions from the Defense Ministry concerning the creation of the State Defense Service which will be responsible to oversee the annual military service.\n\nYou see, the Latvian’s proximity to the Russian megastate has enabled them to gather better intelligence than any of the western states. And the Latvians know that Moscow is far too big of a power to just back out of the war. The Latvian leaders knew that the whole development must be nothing but a part of a larger strategy inculcated by the Russians.\n\nWell, the doubts were soon enough cleared by Putin. In a rare address to the nation, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that the decree concerning partial mobilization of its 2 million-strong military reserves has been signed as the war in Ukraine reaches its seventh month.\n\nThe decision, which Putin said was taken “to defend the motherland, its sovereignty and territorial integrity” is being viewed as an escalatory move by the West.\n\nPutin had initiated the military operation with the aim of liberating the oppressed people of Donbass. And now when the region is under complete Russian control, Putin plans to pull back the regular army and replace it with conscripts to maintain peace in the liberated regions and continue defending the territory if Ukraine launches a ‘counter-offensive’ against the ethnic Russian populace.\n\nThe Baltics Know that NATO is unreliable\n\nYou see, other NATO members like Poland and Hungary are just now coming to consensus with the realities of NATO. The alliance’s leaders have not been instrumental in protecting the interests of its members and have instead used them to carry out their own personal agendas.\n\nThe USA and Germany have extended unparalleled pressure on Poland to support Ukraine militarily. Although, Poland was not reimbursed for the support it was offered by Germany after Warsaw sent its essential military equipment to support Kyiv. The unapologetic refusal by Germany triggered the leaders of Poland who soon started taking anti-EU stands.\n\nHungary, on the other hand, has long taken an opposing stand and also refused to condemn Russia for its military operation and has continued with its energy deals with Russia.\n\nAlthough the Baltic nations know the capacities of the Russian defense system and had previously come to a consensus the west will not come to aid in the event of an escalation by Moscow.\n\nLatvia has so far been the only Baltic state where conscription has not been undertaken since 2007, it resumed in 2015 in Lithuania, and has continued uninterrupted since the 1990s in Estonia.\n\nThe current defense budget of Latvia is €758 million (2% of GDP). The establishment of the State Defense Service will be financed from the growing funds for defense, which would now reach 2.5% of GDP over the next three years.",

He doesn't say what country he was born in, but explains that his family moved here as part of the Soviet occupation of the country shortly after World War II, and returned after being deported to Siberia for a decade's worth of hard labor in 1949.\n\nWhen Latvia gained independence in 1991, Chibaterevsky was one of tens of thousands of ethnic Russians who were never given Latvian citizenship.

Why is Ukraine doing this?\"\n\nLatvian authorities are cracking down on public support of Russia, and that's why Jurijs says nobody here wants to openly talk about the war. \"They can put you in jail for that,\" he says. \"But I'm old.

When Russia invades, they'll come and liberate me.\"\n\nSome Russian-speakers seem to be changing their views on the war\n\nA poll taken earlier this year by Latvian research firm SKDS showed only 25% of Latvians who spoke Russian at home sympathize with the Ukrainian side in the war, while 83% of Latvian speakers supported Ukraine. In another poll conducted by the same firm, 36% of Russian-speakers in Latvia believed that Russia was fighting \"Naziism\" in Ukraine, a narrative pushed by Russian state television, while just 6% of Latvian speakers believed the same to be true.\n\n\"What we know from surveys done before the Russian invasion of Ukraine is that a majority of Russian speakers in Latvia actually had favorable views regarding Russia and Putin,\" says SKDS Executive Director Arnis Kaktins. \"The reason for that is quite a large part of this population lived in the Russian information field, and we know it is very specific, distorted propaganda, and inevitably you are going to believe it and start to think the same way.\"\n\nKaktins says the polls his firm have taken since the war began show an increasing number of Russian-speaking Latvians changing their views to a more nuanced and critical stance on Russian state narratives. Kaktins says young Russian-speaking Latvians tend to be the most critical of Russia's government.\n\nA Ukrainian seeks a roundabout route to the Donbas\n\nBack at Latvia's Terehova border crossing, cars inch forward toward Russia. Among them is the Toyota SUV of Natalia Kononenko, who never thought she'd be here. She's Ukrainian, and she's driven nearly 1,000 miles from Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, where she's been staying, as her home region of Donetsk in the eastern part of her country is being fought over by Russian and Ukrainian troops. Her son, a young student, is stuck there.\n\n\"There's talk that the Russians will take over the rest of our region and then we'll have to make a decision to be on one or other side,\" she says. \"But until now, no one is forcibly taking us anywhere.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Rob Schmitz/NPR Rob Schmitz/NPR\n\nAnd that's why Kononenko is on a rescue mission to pull her son out of the Donetsk region. Instead of driving a few hundred miles through the fighting on the front line and risking getting killed, she's driving thousands of miles, circumnavigating Ukraine, so that she can approach Donetsk from Russia, a journey that'll take several days.\n\nShe's praying that the Russian border guards will allow her into the country. \"There shouldn't be a problem, but we don't know,\" she says with a nervous grin. \"We'll just keep on driving and hope for the best.\"\n\nBehind her in the line is Anatoly Chibatersvsky, the Latvian noncitizen who's also hoping to get to the other side. \"There are benefits to being a noncitizen,\" he concedes. \"With my passport I don't have to buy visas for the EU nor for Russia.\"\n\nHe says even his children who are eligible for Latvian citizenship have opted to be like him and remain stateless. In today's world of national allegiance and the wars fought over it, he says being stateless is, in some ways, a relief.",
    "Police in Latvia dismantle major money laundering group": "Latvian State Police has dismantled a criminal group that provided professional money laundering services in the country using a network of more than 90 «money mules».\n\nIn February 2022 Latvian State Police Department of Cyber Crimes commenced criminal proceedings after receiving information from a Latvia-based credit institution that noticed systematic fraudulent payment activity on accounts of some of its clients.\n\nInformation acquired in the investigation indicates that there was a wide network of «money mules» in Riga, which consisted of youngsters aged 16 to 20 years, who received flash payments on their accounts. These payments mostly came from German citizens. Money from those accounts were then rapidly withdrawn in cash. In most cases this was done around midnight.\n\nVictims say that upon finding their accounts emptied usually tried to call off the transactions made during the night on the next day. However, considering that organisers of this criminal group ensured money was immediately taken from the «money mule’s» account, only a small number of victims were able to intercept and recover the stolen money.\n\nData analysis reveals that around 30 such crimes were committed in a single month. According to authorities, this criminal group may have been active in Latvia since September 2019.\n\nLatvian police performed numerous investigation-related activities to put a stop to the criminal group and identify the suspects. In to months efforts resulted with success.\n\nThe investigation revealed the criminal group consisted of 14 members. One of them was a citizen of Germany. This person coordinated the group from Germany. The organiser had recruiters look for «money mules» with bank accounts in Latvia. The group used these people to receive and move illegally acquired money.\n\nMoney withdrawn from «money mules» was then given away in the form of virtual currency.\n\nFollowing directions from organisers, members of the group also distributed acquired money among themselves. Money mules were paid 50 to 250 euros for their services if they participated in activities multiple times. This way the criminal group was able to launder more than EUR 555 600.\n\nIn April 2020 police detained 13 members of this group.\n\nAmong those detained individuals were also the leaders of the criminal group. Both were put under arrest.\n\nThe leader of the group was detained in Germany in May 2022 thanks to a European arrest warrant, which was issued as a result of long international cooperation between law enforcers of different countries. The German citizen was detained and later arrested after a number of several searchers, interrogations and special investigative activities. Germany extradited him to Latvia for criminal prosecution in summer 2022.\n\nIn August 2022 Latvian police handed criminal proceedings to the Specialized Prosecution Office for Organised Crime and Other Branches to commence criminal prosecution.\n\nConsidering the large number of youngsters that agreed to assist the criminal group by becoming «money mules», State Police stresses to society that such actions carry criminal liability.\n\nPeople who agree to become a «money mule» have to keep in mind that they will not only face criminal liability, but will also experience difficulties for the remainder of their lives because banks close down such people’s access to their bank accounts and access to internet banking services.",
    "Bank of Latvia governor promises economic recession will not be as deep as it was in 2008": "There will be an economic decline or recession, but it will be shallow, said Bank of Latvia governor Mārtiņš Kazāks in an interview to LTV programme Rīta Panorāma on 23 September.\n\nHe explained that the Russian-Ukrainian war is a bad hit for Latvia’s and Europe’s economic situation. This is why the economy is slowed in Latvia and Europe as a whole.\n\nAccording to Kazaks, there will be a recession, but it won’t be as deep as it was in the 2008 crisis. He said this is because currently Latvia’s economy does not have any serious internal problems.\n\nThe end of the year will be difficult, as residents and businesses can expect high heating bills, but the situation should improve in spring 2023.\n\nThe governor of the Bank of Latvia also stressed that it is also highly important to resolve the energy resource issue in a way to ensure there is enough for next winter.\n\nIn June 2022 the Bank of Latvia increased the country’s GDP growth outlook for the year from March’s 1.8% to 2.9%.\n\nAt the same time, the central bank also increased the economic growth outlook for 2023 from 3.2% to 2.4%. In June 2022 the Bank of Latvia predicted the country’s GDP growth to reach 4.2% in 2024, as opposed to 4.1% predicted in March.\n\nIn June the Bank of Latvia also increased the average inflation outlook for 2022 from 9.5% estimated in March to 14.8%. Inflation outlook for 2023 was upgraded from 3.7% to 7%. The annual inflation outlook for 2024 was increased from 2.1% to 2.4%.\n\nIt is planned for the Bank of Latvia to present the latest economic outlooks on 23 September.",
    "Ashes of people who donated their bodies to science to be given special burial in Latvia": "On Wednesday, 28 September, Riga Stradins University will organise a special burial ceremony for people who donated their bodies to science and medicine. The burial event will continue the whole day. Service will be held at Martin’s Evangelical Lutheran Church, followed by a burial at the nearby Martin Cemetery and opening of a monument at RSU Anatomy and Anthropology Institute.\n\nA total of 14 urns containing ashes will be buried.\n\n«The anatomy institute currently has 28 remains. They are used for educational and scientific purposes. However, 2 154 people’s remains have been dissected in 100 years of the institute’s history,» says the author of this event and director of RSU Anatomy and Anthropology Institute, Prof. Māra Pilmane.\n\nShe stresses that dissecting is an important part of medical training: «Every person is unique and individual. Although plastic or digital 3D models are already part of medical education, they cannot convey a full picture of each person’s uniqueness! The word’s leading universities openly admitted at the Congress of International Federation of Associations of Anatomists in 2004 that it is necessary to return to dissecting real bodies during medical students’ training. The number of people who donate their bodies to medicine and science after death is unknown – this information is protected by the law. Nevertheless, our estimates suggest the number is not small,» says Prof. Pilmane.\n\nMemorial event will start off at 10:00 a.m. with a service at Martin’s Evangelical Lutheran Church in Riga, Slokas Street 34. The service will be attended by priests representing Catholic, Lutheran, Orthodox and Baptist confessions. At 11:00 a.m. a burial procession to the nearby Martin Cemetery will commence. There urns with ashes will be buried in the location RSU acquired for this specific purpose.",
    "'Public security issue': Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia to restrict entry of Russian citizens": "European Union members Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have agreed to restrict the entry of Russian citizens travelling from Russia and Belarus, their foreign ministers say.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe three Baltic nations expect the entry ban to be in place by the middle of September, after it gets formal approval from the national governments, Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics said on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In the last couple of weeks and months, the border crossing by Russian citizens holding Schengen visas have dramatically increased,\" he told a press conference in Lithuania.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"This is becoming a public security issue, this is also an issue of a moral and political nature.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe countries will turn back all Russian citizens with visas to enter the EU's Schengen open border area. Exceptions will be made for humanitarian and family reasons, lorry drivers, diplomats.\n\n\n\n\n\nDirect flights between Russia and the EU were cancelled after Russia invaded Ukraine in February , leaving few options for Russians to travel into the union.\n\n\n\nThe scheme would be the first of its kind in the European Union. Estonia has had a softer ban in place since 18 August, barring the entry only of Russians holding Schengen visas issued by Estonian authorities.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinland, which also borders Russia, is not joining the ban due to legal uncertainty over whether it can refuse Russian nationals with Schengen visas issued by other European nations, Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto told the briefing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Can you actually cancel the whole Schengen principles? This is, at the moment, still unclear,\" he said.\n\n\n\nUkraine considering shutting down Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant\n\nUkraine is looking at the option of shutting down its Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant for safety reasons and is worried about the reserves of diesel fuel used for backup generators, Kyiv's top nuclear safety expert said on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe imperilled facility - Europe's largest nuclear power plant - remains disconnected from the Ukrainian grid after shelling cut its external power lines. Moscow and Kyiv accuse each other of shelling the plant risking a nuclear disaster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The option of switching off the station is being assessed, if conditions necessitating the station to be switched off arise,\" Oleh Korikov, acting head of Ukraine's State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate, told a news briefing by video link.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Korikov said the facility was supplying its own electricity needs, but that backup diesel generators would have to be fired up if it remained disconnected, though he gave no time frame for that eventuality.\n\n\n\nHe said it was extremely difficult to replenish the reserves of diesel because of Russia's invasion. Moscow's troops captured the plant in early March but it is still operated by Ukrainian technicians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We could potentially reach a situation where the diesel runs out, which would cause an accident involving the damage of the active zones of the reactors, which would cause the expulsion of radioactive substances into the environment,\" Mr Korikov said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This would have consequences not only for the territory of Ukraine, but also cross-border consequences,\" he said.\n\n\n\n",
    "Religion in Latvia: the Lutherans of Lestene": "The Reformation arrived in Latvia in 1522, bringing with it fanatical vandalism of ornate church interiors deemed as idolatrous. But within a few generations, beauty was once again seen as pleasing to the Almighty.\n\nAnd in this spirit, in 1700, Baron Karl Friedrich von Fircks decided to add a lavish Baroque interior to a modest country church in Lestene, 70 kilometers west of Rīga. To this end, he hired Ventspils woodcarver Nikolass Sefrenss the Younger who spent the next decade creating a timber masterpiece that has no equal in Latvia.\n\nPulpit of Lestene Lutheran church Photo: Philip Birzulis\n\nAn elaborate pulpit and a towering 10.5 meter high altar retable were alive with Biblical saints and symbols from nature. The organ decking included moving angels, a three-dimensional show which so impressed worshipping peasants that they are said to have cried out “Ak, svētā Lestene!” (Oh, holy Lestene!) upon seeing it.\n\nSefrenss perished from the plague in 1710, and the job of painting and gilding the objects wasn’t completed for several more decades. Then the church enjoyed two centuries of peaceful splendor.\n\nHowever, in the final months of the Second World War, as western Latvia was ravaged by the battles of the Courland Pocket, the church steeple burned down. The building’s structural integrity was preserved, but the interior faced a mortal threat in the post-war years. Ordered by local communist officials to destroy the priceless artworks, some of the pieces being hidden by the local school principal at her workplace. When she was threatened, they were spirited to the attic of the Academy of Art in Riga, where once again communist functionaries raised their ugly heads.\n\nAnother group of sculptures was taken to another Kurzeme church for safekeeping. But as bad luck would have it, right at that time that refuge was used as a movie set, and the film crew inadvertently destroyed many of the items.\n\nEventually, the administrators of Rundāle Palace had the courage to pick up the pieces which could be saved and deposit them in their vast basement. Which was fortunate, as in the 1960s a granary was installed in the church, erasing what was left of the old grandeur.\n\n“Many cultural monuments in Latvia were being destroyed at the time, and Rundāle was like a lifeboat,” says Inguna Kokina, the lay head of church’s parish council.\n\nIn a sense, she muses, it was good that the local collective farm decided to use the building, as other churches had simply been razed to the ground in officially sanctioned campaigns of atheistic violence.\n\nIndeed, there had been plans to dynamite Lestene’s church, but there weren’t enough explosives to deal with its two-meter-thick walls.\n\nLestene Lutheran church interior Photo: Philip Birzulis\n\nInguna’s grandmother worked for the barons before the war, and she herself recalls playing inside the church as a child. And for several decades she has been in the midst of efforts to bring it back to life.\n\nIn the early 2000s, a war cemetery was installed next door to bring together the many scattered graves of Latvian soldiers who died fighting in the Courland Pocket as part of the German-uniformed Latvian Legion. And after that weighty task was completed, Inguna says that a group of activists decided it was a shame to have the church in such a sorry state next to this place of remembrance.\n\nBeginning in 2011, the surviving parts of the pulpit and altar retable were returned to Lestene. Surviving figures from the ensembles have been rejuvenated and missing pieces have been created anew by skilled artisans, based on photographs from the 1930s.\n\nThe craftsmen often work for very modest fees out of their passion for the project. But the cost of materials means it doesn’t come cheap. State culture funds are elusive, Inguna sighs, as the officials in charge have repeatedly said that other sites have priority.\n\nBut the work continues as private donations trickle in. Once the elements now in place have been finished, the mighty organ setting will be brought back from Rundāle, completing the resurrection of this unique monument.\n\nSunday services are held fortnightly by a clergyman who covers a number of rural parishes around Tukums County. On average only about ten worshippers turn up each time (although pre-Covid Christmas events attracted a full house).\n\nAccording to Inguna, this is partly due to the shifting demographics of Lestene. Due to wartime devastation, many locals moved away, and they were replaced by immigrants from Latgale and other parts of the former USSR. Fourteen nationalities reside in the area, and although most are well integrated, there is a lack of historical continuity.\n\nStill, Inguna says that the regular parishioners are a tight-knit group. And the community of supporters of the church stretches around the world.\n\nNeed to know\n\nThe best time to see inside the church is during Sunday services. Services are held every second and fourth Sunday of the month at 12:00.\n\nThere is no direct public transport to Lestene from Riga. It’s a one-hour drive.\n\nThe church welcomes donations for the ongoing restorations.",

From Aminata Savadogo coming second with the jury in the Eurovision 2015 grand final…to fan favourites Triana Park and Samanta Tina coming dead last in their semi-finals in 2017 and 2021, Latvia is a real roller coaster of results.\n\nAnd today we are one step closer to seeing what Fortune has in store this year with the opening of the song submission process for LTV’s Supernova 2023 — its national selection show.\n\nApplications are being accepted until December 1 on the official Supernova website https://supernova.lsm.lv/lv/.\n\nIn a press release, the producers clarified the basic rules.\n\n“Performers, authors and producers who have reached the age of 16 are invited to participate in the competition. Applications from soloists, duets and groups (up to six participants) are welcome. Foreign citizens may participate in the competition as authors of song lyrics, music authors or producers of phonograms. The submitted song must not have been published or played publicly before September 1, 2022.”\n\nA special jury will determine which songs and entries make it to the Supernova broadcasts. This jury will consist of professionals within the Latvian music, events and TV industry, as well as foreign professionals. LTV also reserves the right to invite performers and authors to participate in the competition.\n\nInterestingly, the broadcaster says it will not reveal the names of these jury members until after Eurovision in May “for security reasons.” This is likely to avoid any attempts to influence said jury members before the show and to reduce hostilities and hurt feelings within the industry after the reveal.\n\n“The participants and songs selected for the competition will be available for public evaluation in January 2023. The television shows are expected on the LTV in February 2023.”\n\nAgnese Strause-Kubliņa, Head of Children, Youth and Entertainment Broadcasting at LTV, sang the praises of the country’s most recent entry.\n\n“Supernova is the biggest competition organized by the Television of Latvia (LTV), the winners of which get a ticket to the Eurovision, which is not only a fantastic opportunity and an unforgettable experience for artists, but also a very responsible task of representing Latvia. We are proud of the audience’s recognition this year – the ratings of the Supernova were the best in recent years! The winners – Citi Zeni – allowed everyone to notice Latvia in the Eurovision, but who will be next?! Although there is no specific formula for creating a Eurovision winning song, we wish musicians creative flight and courage in submitting songs to the Supernova contest!”\n\nIn the run-up to Eurovision 2022, Citi Zeni established themselves as darlings of the promo tour, appearing at concert after concert while slaying social media with their unique sense of humour. Their song, which promoted the virtues of the vegan lifestyle, opened with that vulgar line about stimulating the female genitals using the tongue or lips.\n\nWiwiblogger Robyn was able to look past it. As she wrote in our Wiwi Jury review post:\n\n“The unavoidable opening line grabs a lot of attention, but if you look beyond it, Eat Your Salad is a funky bop. It’s reminiscent of Bruno Mars or even the feel-good tunes of Daði Freyr. The song has an environmental message, but it’s not delivered in a heavy-handed way, instead giving listeners something to groove to while they eat their salad and think about their cat.”\n\nAre there any artists you hope to see submit this year?

    "Latvian government to develop more support measures for residents during energy crisis": "On Thursday, 22 September, Latvia’s Saeima asked the government to develop additional measures to support residents during upcoming heating season and reduce the impact from growing energy prices.\n\nThe Saeima gave the Cabinet of Ministers a month to develop and present appropriate proposals for measures to take in order to overcome the crisis caused by growing energy resource prices.\n\nAdditional support is necessary due to the rapid increase of energy resource prices, especially for natural gas, and the negative effect this has on manufacturing costs across all segments, competitiveness of the national economy and household expenses, as reported by Saeima’s press-service.\n\nThe parliament’s decision also mentions that in order to secure at least partial energy resource price compensation it is necessary to immediately increase state support.\n\nUntil now the planned support to compensate rising heating costs was EUR 350 million, which is now considered insufficient. On top of that, it will reach a small portion of residents, as previously outlined by deputies during a meeting of the government and municipal committees. Representatives of multiple municipal councils also expressed concerns about the upcoming heating season.\n\nThe government has allocated funding from the budget programme for emergencies in order to provide residents of pension age, disabled residents and survivors between 1 November and 31 December.\n\nBenefits will be paid in the following amounts:\n\nEUR 30 a month if pension, benefit or state social insurance benefit amount or their total does not exceed EUR 300 a month;\n\nEUR 20 a month if pension, benefit or state social insurance benefit amount or their total is between EUR 301 to EUR 509 a month;\n\nEUR 10 a month if pension, benefit or state social insurance benefit amount or their total is between EUR 510 to EUR 603.\n\nIf a person receives too much than what is allowed, digits after the comma are left out.\n\nFor example, if the old age pension amount is EUR 300.94, the cents after the comma us left out and the person is paid a benefit of EUR 30 a month.\n\nThe total state benefit payment period is set between 1 November 2022 and 31 May 2023. The funding necessary to afford the payment of state benefits will be clarified in the State Budget Project for 2023 and the Medium-term Budget for 2023, 2024 and 2025 legislative drafts.\n\nThis state benefit will be paid to people living in Latvia who are paid old age, disability or survivor pension, as well as early and advance pension.\n\nThe benefit will be paid to recipients of loss of capacity for work or survivors’ compensation and recipients of state social security benefits.\n\nThe state benefit of EUR 30 will be paid to persons who are recipients of the supplement to the state family allowance for a child with disabilities; persons of legal age who are granted refugee or alternative status in the Republic of Latvia and who are legally residing in the Republic of Latvia with a valid residence permit or temporary residence permit issued by the Republic of Latvia, and who have reached the age specified in the Law on State Pensions.\n\nPayment of state benefits will start in November, as reported by Ministry of Welfare.",
    "Destination: Latvia": "BY EKATERINA KRONGAUZ\n\nIldar, 35; Zhenya, 28\n\nIldar greeted the New Year of 2022 with his partner, Zhenya, a dog, and two cats in their apartment in Moscow. Two years earlier they had moved to Moscow from Noyabrsk (a city of 100,000 people 3,000 kilometers from Moscow), and in the fall of 2021 they took out a fifteen-year mortgage for 7 million rubles (U.S. $100,000) with a $1,200 monthly payment, and bought their first apartment. They made some repairs and celebrated the New Year in their new home.\n\n\n\nIldar (left) and Zhenya on a walk Image Credit\n\n\n\nCourtesy of Ildar\n\nThe move to Moscow happened spontaneously. Ildar had studied as a sound engineer at the Moscow Institute in absentia, working remotely for a podcast studio. Zhenya had her own business in Noyabrsk, a plus-size women's fashion clothing store, which she ran jointly with her mother.\n\n“I never wanted to leave. I have always resisted it at all stages of our life. I don't like stepping out of my comfort zone. And I didn’t want to leave because I don’t know a single foreign language,” says Ildar.\n\nWhen the war began, Zhenya became very ill.\n\nZhenya was born in Ukraine. Her family is from Ukraine, and her grandmother was still living in the city of Dobropolye, Donetsk oblast—currently a Russian-occupied territory.\n\n“Every day we talked with my grandmother,” she says. “We packed a bag for her in case of emergency. The neighbors cleared out the basement, and we rehearsed with her over the phone going to the basement. But in the end, we managed to persuade my grandmother to go west.”\n\nThe idea to leave Russia came to Zhenya first in 2014, the year the Crimean Peninsula was annexed by Russia. Zhenya told Ildar, “All your doubts are garbage! Let’s go to Holland,” but Ildar didn’t want to leave then.\n\n“I began to look up information on Georgia on Google—everyone was talking about Georgia,” Ildar recounts. “Visas were not needed. Living was cheap. I could not discuss this with Zhenya; she was in some kind of coma. I now understand that we generally had very little contact then. She sat and read the news on Telegram all day long.” At that moment, Ildar was afraid of a new iron curtain and the mobilization of all men; this was what scared posters on the Telegram channel. And Ildar began to discuss with Zhenya leaving Russia.\n\nIldar did not discuss the war or leaving Russia with his parents. “They live in a village in Bashkiria. And we didn't talk much. When I visited them, Solovyov”—a popular propagandist state TV host—“was on all the time. At the beginning of the war, my mother sent me some playful poems about poor Mother Russia, how the West kept pecking at her. I tried to explain my position to her, and she hung up. Several times I tried to talk to her, but she abruptly turned off her phone. I hadn’t seen this before—we don’t hang up on each other in our family.”\n\nThrough work acquaintances, Ildar and Zhenya learned that they could get a humanitarian visa to stay in Lithuania (Ildar is working on several sociopolitical podcasts). And Zhenya and Ildar decided to go. Ildar changed all their money at an insane rate (he managed to get a little more than €6,000), and agreed with a friend that he could rent their apartment for $250. Ildar also lined up more work for himself. “When I'm worried, I always load up on work. First, it helps not to think. Second, in this way I can calm my fears about money.”\n\nWhile the visas and all the documents for two cats and a dog were being processed, Zhenya went to Noyabrsk to say good-bye to everyone. A week before leaving, Zhenya asked Ildar if he was going to say good-bye to his parents and if he understood that he might not see them for a very long time. So Ildar went: five hours one way and five hours return.\n\n“I called them and said I would come. When I arrived, they were horrified. They thought something terrible had happened, that perhaps I was getting divorced. I said, “But what I told you doesn’t scare you?!”\n\n\n\nIldar, pictured with his cat Image Credit\n\n\n\nCourtesy of Ildar\n\nAs they started talking, Ildar realized that his assumptions had been wrong: “They understand everything. They understand that something bad is happening. They just think that you shouldn‘t raise your head or open your mouth.” His mother told Ildar that she was getting rid of the phones because she was afraid that they would be tapped and that Ildar would talk too much on the phone and would be arrested.\n\nThe family had never talked much about their past, but Ildar remembers some conversations: a great-grandmother and great-grandfather had been dispossessed, possibly even killed. Whether someone in the family was imprisoned Ildar does not know either, but his mother was afraid this might happen, and afraid for Ildar. “I re-posted a lot in the early days [of the war] on my social media. I remember now that I was a little afraid then. I edit various podcasts, and there were audio diaries of people in Ukraine during the bombings. It was already forbidden to say the word “war,” but all these criminal articles about discrediting the army did not yet exist. Of course, my mother was also afraid for me. But we had a good good-bye. We went to the banya with Dad,” says Ildar.\n\nOn April 29, Ildar’s father-in-law came down to Moscow and loaded into the car one suitcase each for Ildar and Zhenya, two electric guitars, two cats and a dog, and a friend who was also going to Riga, and together they made their way to the Russian-Estonian border. He dropped them off at 8 a.m., and with their suitcases, guitars and pets, Ildar and Zhenya tried to cross the border.\n\nThey were turned back. “It turned out that a humanitarian visa was not enough for us. We needed an additional letter saying that we were entering by invitation, an entry permit.” It was Easter Sunday, but Ildar managed to get such a letter, print it out, and cross the border at 8 p.m.\n\nIn Latvia\n\nIldar and Zhenya have been living in Latvia for four months on a Lithuanian humanitarian visa. Ildar works for a podcast studio. Zhenya volunteers at the NGO Helping to Leave and helps Ukrainian families from Mariupol who ended up in Russia get to Europe.\n\nIldar and Zhenya had hoped they could stay in Riga, but recently Latvian officials have begun to say that they would neither provide documents to Russian citizens nor renew existing visas.\n\n“I don’t think about anything and I don’t plan anything. We have until April 2023. I know that Zhenya Googles at night about study visas, about Portugal. And there is even an option in Bulgaria,” says Ildar.\n\nThere is another option that Ildar does not want to think about right now. Zhenya can get a Ukrainian passport because her whole family is from Ukraine. And this means that Ildar can also get a Ukrainian passport. But then they would both have to give up their Russian passports, and they would no longer be able to visit their parents in Russia.\n\nBut with a Ukrainian passport it is easier to get European documents. It would also be possible for Zhenya alone to acquire a Ukrainian passport, and then either Zhenya's documents or Ildar’s could be used, but Ildar does not want this. Nor does Ildar want to return to Russia, or even visit.\n\n“I don't know, I don't understand. It seems to me that no one needs me, and no one is looking for me. But I don't want to check.

    "All to fight for with one week until Saeima elections in Latvia": "Asked which way they would vote if Saeima elections were held tomorrow, 1,825 Latvian citizens of voting age gave Prime Minister Krišjānis Kariņš' New Unity (JV) top spot with 13.3%, almost double the opposition Greens and Farmers Union (ZZS) with 7.8 %. They take second place despite having as their Prime Ministerial candidate Aivars Lembergs – a man sent to prison for five years and sanctioned by the United States.\n\nThird place is held by the right-of-center National Alliance (NA) on 7.3%, followed by the relatively new United List (AS) on 5.4%, which is made up of various smaller parties in an alliance that gives them more critical mass. Harmony (S), which describes itself as a social democrat party, is next with 5.1%.\n\nPhoto: Latvijas Televīzija\n\nIn sixth and seventh place are two liberal-oriented parties the Progressives (P) on 4.9% and For Development/For! (A/P!) on 3.6%.\n\nNo other parties make it across the 5%-of-the-vote threshold required to win seats in the Saeima, though several parties are hovering just below that level. Thus anything from 7 to 12 parties might constitute the next Saeima. There are 19 parties contesting the election in all. For more information on them, see our earlier series of features, and for a full run-down of how the elections work in Latvia, we can offer this.\n\nPhoto: Latvijas Televīzija\n\nHowever, it should be noted that a significant portion of the electorate remains uncommitted as yet. 10.4% of those surveyed said they had no intention of voting at all and nearly a quarter (23.7%) said they remained undecided, so candidates will have plenty to fight over during the next seven days, and it would be no surprise to see the popularity of parties in the final voting tallies differ considerably from the pre-election polls.\n\nIn an additional question about how motivated to vote people were, SKDS and LTV obtained the following data: 37% of people said they would definitely vote, 33% said they would probably vote, 13% said they would probably not vote and 10% said they would definitely not vote. 7% were unable even to decide on this question.",
    "Fur farming in Latvia to be banned starting with 2028. Parliament prepares legislative framework": "On Thursday, 22 September, Latvia’s Saeima passed in the final reading amendments to the Animal Protection Law in order to bank animal farming if the main purpose is collecting their fur. This ban is planned to come into force on 1 January 2028.\n\nThe objective of these amendments is completely banning fur farming in Latvia. Amendments do not apply to acquisition of furs during hunts or trade of furs.\n\nAt first it was planned to impose the ban starting with 2026, but then it was decided to postpone it until 2028.\n\nThe Food and Veterinary Service reports there are four fur farms in Latvia that breed animals specifically for their fur. All three fur farms specialise in mink fur.\n\nThe annotation to the law mentions that animal keeping and killing for fur is unethical, cruel and an outdated form of business that has no justification to exist in modern day. According to authors of amendments, this business pollutes the environment and does not contribute to the national economy.\n\nIt is planned for amendments to prevent the deaths and suffering of those animals, authors of legislative draft say. The preamble to the Animal Protection Law states that\n\n«without a substantiated reason no one is permitted to kill an animal, to cause it pain, create suffering or to otherwise harm it,» which is breached by the practice of breeding and killing of foxes, mink and chinchillas for fur.\n\nAuthors of amendments say that results of sociological surveys indicate that the majority of residents in Latvia are against breeding and killing animals without a justified reason. Many countries have already banned fur farming within their respectable territories.\n\nAccording to the survey carried out by SKDS in 2021, 63% of respondents in Latvia do not approve of breeding and keeping animals for their fur coats. More than 40 000 people signed the online petition addressed to the Saeima in hopes of banning fur farming. More than 50 non-government organisations have also requested this industry to be banned in the country on multiple occasions, politicians say.\n\nAt the same time, authors of amendments stress that the opinion in Latvia reflects the trend in Europe, where many countries have different restrictions in place.\n\nSaeima deputies stress there is reason to believe animal suffering is an unavoidable part of fur farming. Without it, this business would not be profitable. Animal Protection Law states that animal owners have the obligation to ensure the compliance of animal keeping conditions, equipment, food and water with its physiological and ethological needs taking into account the species of the relevant animal, degree of development, adaptation and domestication.\n\nCages, however, do not, for example, allow mink to swim, foxes to dig and socialize, chinchillas – to frolic and leap, Saeima deputies stress.\n\nAnimals kept in cages are subjected to constant suffering even if fur farming is carried out in accordance with Cabinet of Ministers requirements for fur animals’ welfare, authors of amendments stress.\n\nAccording to information from Agricultural Data Centre for 1 July 2020, there were 579 945 animals kept in fur farms in Latvia. This includes 579 320 mink, 443 foxes and 182 chinchillas. This means mink account for 99% of animals kept in fur farms. In the wild, mink cover a distance between 1 and 3 m2. They are solitary, territorial animals that partially live in water.\n\nHowever, Cabinet of Ministers requirements on animal welfare state that mink are permitted to be kept in 30x70x45 cm large cages in close proximity to other mink. Needless to say there is no way for them to frolic, swim or hunt in those cages.\n\nAccording to information provided by Saeima deputies, scientific research indicates that the lack of swimming causes high stress levels and a shortage of food for mink.\n\nThe conditions these animals are kept in are far from their natural habitat, which causes psychological stress and behaviour typical for mink kept in fur farms – pointless repetition of the same actions over and over.\n\nFur farm employees kill mink by putting them in gas cameras and flood them with carbon monoxide or dioxide. For years it’s been known that this method is slow and painful, since mink can hold their breath for long periods of time and have been known to survive even after 10 to 20 minuts of gassing, as mentioned in the annotation to the passed amendments.\n\nIn June 2021 there were eight fur farms registered in Latvia. The tax revenue from PIT, corporate income tax and VAT in 2019 and 2020 was negative. VAT returns exceeded revenue from other taxes, politicians say.",
    "We regained independence against Gorbachev’s will: Latvian President": "There are people in the West who regard Mikhail Gorbachev, the late last leader of the Soviet Union as a tragic figure of a liberal reformer, whose efforts to liberalise his country unravelled it at the seams.

    "Who’s a Latvian and why? A complex question just got harder.": "“To have a strong society ... you should have a common history,” says pollster Arnis Kaktins. “We don’t have that.”\n\nOne focus of discord was the Victory Memorial in the capital, Riga, commemorating the Soviet soldiers who died freeing Latvia from the Nazis. But most Latvians remember better the Soviets’ own 50-year occupation of their land. Last week the authorities toppled the monument, calling it a catalyst for polarization.\n\nRussian Latvians may not be numerous, but they wield potential influence. Most of them are neutral on the Ukraine war, or support Kyiv, but others could cause trouble, officials fear.\n\nThe government is cracking down on the small minority of ethnic Russians who support President Vladimir Putin, and just when dialogue would seem more important than ever, people have largely “closed all the windows and switched off the lights” on discussion of the identity issue, says Deniss Hanovs, a professor of cultural history.\n\nLatvia had been making progress toward the inclusion of its ethnic Russian citizens. But the war in Ukraine has frozen such movement as the government raises its guard against neighboring Russia.\n\nAs they distanced themselves from memories of Soviet occupation, the puzzle seemed to be growing less fraught. But Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine has brought old divisions to the surface.\n\nSince Latvia declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1990, its citizens – a quarter of whom are ethnic Russians – have been wrestling to define their identities.\n\nThe nature of Alice Zvezda’s identity is as challenging to juggle as the infant she’s pushing around a Riga park.\n\n“My husband is Latvian and I am Russian. So I am like, both. I feel myself both,” says Ms. Zvezda as she rocks her baby stroller cradling a next-generation Russian Latvian.\n\nThat kind of dual identity had been growing easier to navigate as Latvians distanced themselves from memories of their country’s 50-year occupation by the Soviet Union that ended in the early 1990s.\n\nWhy We Wrote This Transformation Latvia had been making progress toward the inclusion of its ethnic Russian citizens. But the war in Ukraine has frozen such movement as the government raises its guard against neighboring Russia.\n\nBut it suddenly got harder last February, when Russia invaded Ukraine and the Latvian government began arming itself with words and weapons: It is reinstituting the military draft, excising Russian language from public schools, banning Russian state media from the airwaves, and dismantling Soviet-era memorials.\n\nThe vast majority of Latvians — including a quarter of the country’s Russian speakers —are solidly against the war in Ukraine, but a small and significant segment of the Russian diaspora sympathizes with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Once tolerant of such citizens, the Latvian government is now trying to crack down on their way of thinking, just when Latvian society was making some progress toward inclusion of its multitude of ethnic identities.\n\nIt would seem that dialogue over Latvian identity, a complex construct of language, culture, and nationality, is needed more than ever. But since the war began, people have largely “closed all the windows and switched off the lights” on discussion, says Deniss Hanovs, a Russian Latvian cultural history professor at Riga Stradiņš University.\n\n“The history of Latvia has been so very bloody and full of conflict and tragedy that most people stick to ethnic identity” when they define themselves, says Dr. Hanovs. “But we need to go beyond ethnic identity. One needs to be a citizen. The notion of [a] political nation is the only future for a multiethnic culture in Europe.”\n\nKaren Norris/Staff\n\nA complicated dance\n\nBut that’s a complicated dance today for a society that’s roughly a quarter ethnic Russian. “The younger generation [of ethnic Russians and Latvians] is making families together and we do not have conflict,” explains Ms. Zvezda. “We were hoping when the generations change and the politicians are our age, it will be totally fine – love and understanding. But no, now war came. And it’s splitting the community.”\n\nAbout 150,000 Russian-speaking Latvians sympathize with Russia on the war, polls have found. “That’s a lot for small Latvia,” says Ieva Bērziņa, a researcher on Russian strategy at the National Defense Academy of Latvia.\n\nAnd it leaves open the possibility that the Kremlin might destabilize Latvia using the Russian diaspora. Reaching out to this population through a common language, religion, and historical memory offers Russia an “unparalleled soft power influence to further foreign policies abroad,” in the words of a 2021 report by researchers at the London School of Economics.\n\nDr. Bērziņa found in a 2016 study that Russian influence in Latvia could be “quite huge ... when it comes to war and real-life situations that can catalyze differences within society,” she says. “When it goes out onto the street it’s a huge problem.”\n\nOne of those potential catalysts was the Victory Memorial in Riga, where ethnic Russians congregated every May 9 to celebrate the Soviet Army’s victory over Nazi Germany. (The Soviets liberated Latvia from the Germans but ushered in their own five-decade-long occupation of the country.)\n\nThe authorities last week toppled the main obelisk, saying it risked “polarizing society,” and removed other structures from the memorial complex, in line with the wishes of roughly 75% of Latvian speakers, but against those of the same proportion of Russian speakers, according to a poll by the Latvian polling firm SKDS. It’s a stark divide.\n\n“The monument means different things for Latvians and Russians,” explains Dr. Bērziņa. “For Latvians it’s a symbol of [Soviet] occupation and pain, and for Russian speakers it’s primarily a commemoration of their ancestors who fought against Nazi Germany.”\n\nThis lack of a shared understanding of history hinders progress toward a harmonious Latvian society, says pollster Arnis Kaktins, SKDS’s executive director.\n\n“To have a strong society, one of the pillars is that you should have a common history, and we don’t have that,” he says. “We have two different histories regarding the Second World War – with different beliefs around whether Russia occupied us, or whether they liberated us from the evil fascists.”\n\nLenora Chu Latvian Defense Minister Artis Pabriks poses in his office building in Riga Aug. 2, 2022. Mr. Pabriks says that ethnic Russians who long for the Soviet era's glory days must \"change their way of thinking.\"\n\nUsing Pushkin as a weapon\n\nBut minds are changing, nonetheless. Half of Russian speakers tell pollsters they sympathize with neither Russia nor Ukraine in the war. This group appears to be in transition away from traditional loyalties, says Mr. Kaktins.\n\n“They are confused; they are shocked; they need more time to talk, to understand, and to process what’s actually happening,” he says. “If suddenly something happens which contradicts your worldview of Russia as beautiful and good, you don’t automatically change it in two hours. It is a very slow, gradual process. It takes a long time.”\n\nUntil the Ukraine war began, adds Dr. Hanovs, the Russian Latvian cultural history professor, ethnic Russians had seen their former homeland’s history in a heroic light, symbolized by musicians and poets such as Peter Tchaikovsky and Aleksandr Pushkin. They never associated their culture with evil.\n\n“Now, starting from February, this is part of my own [Russian] identity,” Dr. Hanovs says, explaining that President Putin invaded Ukraine in the name of Russia’s glorious past. “It’s not only Tchaikovsky and Pushkin, but also ‘Pushkin can be used to kill people in Ukraine,’” he says.\n\nLatvia’s defense minister, Artis Pabriks, is losing patience. He is in charge of reinstituting military conscription by 2023, and he insists that Putin supporters must understand that the glory days of the Soviet Union are over.\n\n“How can you tolerate in your country people who are saying, ‘We’re against Parliament and against democracy and against freedom’?” asks Mr. Pabriks during an interview in Riga. “We cannot simply say, ‘Oh yes, you are against an independent Latvia but you’re welcome to walk around.’”\n\nThat hardening attitude indicates how difficult it could be to integrate Latvia without alienating those on the fringes, and without suppressing Russian culture and language.\n\nThe sizable group of Russian speakers who declare themselves patriotic citizens of Latvia might show the way, if the government takes a nuanced approach.\n\n“I hope the Latvian political elite will manage to differentiate between those who are part of Latvia and those who still exist in the past,” Dr. Hanovs says. And some observers believe that the war might actually speed up convergence on a national Latvian identity, as Russians are forced to confront hard facts about their former motherland.\n\nMs. Zvezda, the young Russian Latvian mother living in Riga, harbors more modest hopes – that the growing difficulties of everyday life will push larger questions of war and peace and ethnic identity aside.\n\nGet stories that\n\nempower and uplift daily.

Reports of four deaths were received as well, according to data from the Disease Prevention and Control Centre (SPKC).\n\n5 405 Covid-19 laboratory tests were performed. 25.3% of them turned out positive.\n\nThe 14-day cumulative Covid-19 infection index in Latvia increased from 643.2 to 678 per 100 000 residents. The seven-day cumulative index has increased from 374.2 to 398.1 per 100 000 residents.\n\nReports of four deaths were received in the last 24 hours. One person was in the 60-69 years age group, one in the 70-79 years age group, one in the 80-89 years age group, and one person was in the 90-99 years age group. All were either non-vaccinated or had not completed their vaccination course at the time of infection.\n\nSPKC reports that some than six months have passed since the majority of Latvia’s residents have had their initial jabs. This means booster jabs are recommended.\n\nAnalysis shows that vaccination helps reduce the risk of severe infection and risk of death.\n\n5 979 Covid-19 patients have died in Latvia since the start of the pandemic.\n\nSPKC previously explained there may be discrepancies with data regarding deaths. The reason is because this information is usually reported with a delay. SPKC mainly receives data from hospitals and nursing homes. There is also the issue of Covid-19 being reported as a side-factor in people’s deaths.\n\nSince the start of the pandemic Covid-19 has been confirmed in 913 371 cases.\n\nAccording to information from LETA, a total of 7 467 people were infected with Covid-19 in the last seven days.",
    "Latvia ships more military and humanitarian aid for Ukrainians": "The assistance includes warm tactical clothing, shoes, and equipment for Ukrainian soldiers. Credit: Military journalist Taras Gren/Ministry of Defense of Ukraine/Flickr (Creative Commons).\n\nThe Latvian Ministry of Defence (MoD) has announced the delivery of additional military and humanitarian assistance to support Ukrainians.\n\nDefence Ministry parliamentary secretary Baiba Bļodniece and international military-religious cooperation senior expert Elmārs Pļaviņš handed over the aid package to the relevant authorities during their visit to Ukraine.\n\nThe package comprised donations from Latvian companies, citizens, and ‘Entrepreneurs for Peace’ movements, as well as the country’s armed forces.\n\nThe latest assistance includes warm tactical clothing, shoes, and equipment for soldiers, SUVs, and military equipment.\n\nPļaviņš said the vehicles delivered to Ukraine will support the Ukrainian Armed Forces and National Guard units.\n\nThe country also shipped cars to be used by state bodies to enable the transportation of foreign aid to necessary places.\n\nIn collaboration with the ‘Entrepreneurs for Peace’, the Latvian MoD is collecting donations worth over €7m.\n\nThe package will include military vehicles, body armours, armoured ambulances, binoculars, and night vision equipment, among others, for the Ukrainian armed forces.\n\nSince 24 February, Latvia has delivered over €300m of military aid.\n\nSwedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson also pledged additional military and civilian assistance worth $93.59m (Skr1bn) to Ukraine.\n\nThe military aid, valued at $46.75m (Skr500mn), will reportedly include anti-tank weapons, personal protective equipment, and mine clearance equipment.\n\nOn the war front, a US Department of Defense (DoD) senior official revealed that Russia is focusing on ‘increasing the size of its military by 137,000 to 1.15m’.\n\nThe official said: “This effort is unlikely to succeed, as Russia has historically not met personnel and strength targets.”\n\n“Any additional personnel that Russia actually can muster by the end of the year, in fact, may not increase overall Russian combat power.”",
    "One in four at risk of poverty and social exclusion in Latvia": "In 2021, 95.4 million people in the EU, representing 21.7% of the population, were at risk of poverty or social exclusion, i.e. lived in households experiencing at least one of the three poverty and social exclusion risks (risk of poverty, severe material and social deprivation and/or living in a household with very low work intensity). This is a slight increase compared with 2020 (94.8 million; 21.6% of the population).\n\nThe risk of poverty or social exclusion varied across the EU Member States.

    "Doctors in Latvia to organise repeated warning strike": "The council of Latvian Health and Social Care Workers’ Trade Union (LVSADA) decided on Tuesday, 20 September, to organise a repeated warning strike on 27th and 28th of September.\n\nDuring this strike it is planned to hold a protest outside the Cabinet of Ministers building.\n\nLVSADA stresses that after the first warning strike held on 27 July and the rally outside the Ministry of Health, the institution did not show any initiative to fulfil demands of the strike.\n\nAs previously reported by the trade union’s coordinator Inga Rudzīte, the organisation has tried looking for a compromise, adding that demands have been reduced since the reconciliation talks held with the ministry in autumn 2021.\n\nCurrently only one demand remains – LVSADA insists that, in accordance with the previous decision of the Cabinet of Ministers, the wage of doctors and functional specialists should reach at least EUR 1 862, the wage of treatment and patient care staff and assistants of functional specialists is to be at least EUR 1 117, and the wage of treatment and patient care support staff is to reach at least EUR 745.\n\nAccording to this demand, the state-guaranteed average wage in the second half of 2022 should reach EUR 2 048 before taxes for doctors and functional specialists, EUR 1 229 for treatment and patient care support staff and functional specialists’ assistants, and EUR 820 for treatment and patient care support staff.\n\nLVSADA notes that one of the biggest problems that exist in Latvia’s healthcare is the shortage of workers, and the main cause of this problem is the abnormally low wages.\n\nThe European Commission, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the World Bank all mentioned this to the Latvian government and the Saeima in the past. Data from the Central Statistical Bureau of Latvia indicate that healthcare is among the top five earning industries in the country.\n\nLVSADA stresses that when approving the National Development plan for 2021-2027, the parliament stressed that it is necessary to significantly increase the wages paid to workers in the public health sector.\n\nAccording to LVSADA, the government under Prime Minister Krišjānis Kariņš pretends to know nothing of this, like it pretends to know nothing of demands of the strike.\n\nThe Ministry of Health, on the other hand, stresses that in recent years the state budget funding diverted towards healthcare has grown considerably, reaching EUR 1.54 billion in 2022.\n\nBetween 2017 and 2022 the government diverted a total of EUR 467.21 million towards the increase of wages of medical personnel in Latvia.\n\nTo improve accessibility of healthcare services, one of the biggest challenges is providing qualified medical personnel who would provide state-financed services, the ministry admits. According to the institution, an additional amount of EUR 35 million was diverted towards wages of medical personnel in 2022.\n\nFrom 1 January 2022 onward the average wage tariff for doctors and functional specialists is increased from EUR 1 862 to EUR 1 963. Wages of treatment and patient care staff and functional specialists’ assistants is increased from EUR 1 117 to EUR 1 183.\n\nAdditionally, in 2022 doctors’ and functional specialists’ lowest monthly wage amount was increased by 4.4% – from EUR 1 489 to EUR 1 555. The lowest wages of nurses and certified assistant doctors was increased by 4.74% – from EUR 985 to EUR 1 032, the ministry explains.",

    "Over 3,300 Ukrainian children will start school year in Latvia": "More than 3,300 Ukrainians will start learning in kindergartens and schools of Latvia on Thursday. Their full integration in the training process is planned this year with education in Latvian only or in minority programs in Ukrainian, Latvian Television reported.\n\nOf the 3,300 children, around 1,000 pupils will start the school year in Rīga this year, around 700 children will go to kindergartens, and another 400 in private education institutions, amounting to more than 2,000 children in the capital. The most demanded is the Riga Ukrainian High School, whose capacity has been exhausted. However, at each school, additional Latvian language lessons will be provided for each child.\n\n“I don’t think it will be complicated in other schools where Ukrainian children learn. Educators are informed and children, especially in primary school, are interested in having Ukrainians in their class. It’s not a problem with the language. The children learn and find their place very quickly, and it will be good! Summer was the time when children could add to their Latvian knowledge. Several camps were also organized for Ukrainian children,” said Baiba Sieceniece, spokeswoman for the Education, Culture and Sports Department of the Riga City Council.\n\nData on the number of pupils are still variable. The latest estimates by the Ministry of Education and Science (IZM) show that 3,339 Ukrainian children will start the new school year. Two-thirds will go to school, the remaining one-third to kindergarten. The schools are prepared, and the models on how to implement it successfully vary said the responsible ministry. There will also be aid.\n\n“The state provides, as until now, funding. For each Ukrainian pupil, it is €257 for the implementation of the individual plan, and the individual plan means learning the Latvian language. There is also €50 in aid for study materials,” said Olita Arkle, senior expert at the Education and Science Ministry’s Education Department.",

    "Survey: Doctor's profession most prestigious in Latvia": "In July and August, a survey was carried out by the Latvian Doctors Congress to find out patients' views on the quality of health care and doctors' work.\n\n\"The survey also asked residents how much, in their view, different professionals can be trusted. Doctors and nurses enjoy the trust of the population, and it only slightly, within the statistical error, lags behind the level of trust for engineers and architects. In turn, politicians, officials, and judges have little trust. Moreover, the dynamics of public confidence in doctors are very positive, which demonstrates once again the role of doctors as opinion leaders in society,” said Arnis Kaktiņš, director of the SKDS.\n\nDoctors themselves have estimated the prestige of their profession on a 10-point scale at 6.93, which is significantly higher than in previous polls, SKDS noted. The Latvian residents, on the other hand, have assessed the doctor's profession as the most prestigious. Architects, lawyers, and entrepreneurs follow.\n\n“The assessment of the public is, of course, very important, bu as important is the satisfaction of the doctors themselves with their professional choices. Still, 75% of doctors would choose the same profession now, only 9% are disappointed in their choices, while 15% found it hard to answer the question. [..] However, if it is about children's professional choices, 57% of doctors would recommend that their children be a doctor, but 35% would not recommend it,” said Ilze Aizsilniece, president of the Latvian Medical Association.\n\nCompared to surveys of 2017 and 2013, there has been a significant increase in the number of doctors who believe that medical treatment is properly assessed financially, as well as working conditions have improved. If in 2017, only 14% of respondents estimated their wages as fair, this year they are already 29% of doctors surveyed. Still, 59% of doctors remain who believe the financial valuation isn't adequate.\n\nAfter a Covid pandemic for nearly three years, it was important to see how workload, physical and mental health were assessed by doctors themselves, who had been subjected to increased stress and overload all the time. The survey showed that there was a dramatic increase in the number of patients with whom the doctor is in daily contact during one week. This year, they average 80 patients, while still in 2017, they were 66 patients a week, according to data from SKDS.\n\nSimilarly, the survey has shown that doctors are still forced to work in a number of jobs; 22% work even in three and more jobs. Only 43% of those surveyed said they had only one job. These data show that there is a chronic shortage of doctors in Latvia, which also poses additional epidemiological security risks, according to SKDS.\n\nBurnout at work is an integral part of the doctor's profession. In the 10 years since the polls are conducted, the situation hasn't improved significantly. Each third is still 35% often experiencing burnout and 53% sometimes. Only 9% of doctors surveyed have found that they have never experienced burnout at work.\n\nThe survey showed for the first time how residents and doctors assess Latvia's health system and its compliance with modern requirements. As a whole, only 13% of doctors and 17% of the population have assessed Latvian health care systems as good, but 28% of doctors and 32% of the population assessed it as poor.\n\nThe survey was carried out by the study center SKDS, with a total of 1005 Latvians aged 18-65 and 1187 doctors participating."
