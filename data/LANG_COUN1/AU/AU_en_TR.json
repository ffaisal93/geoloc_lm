(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer)\n\nANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey on Monday summoned the Greek ambassador to protest the alleged deployment of dozens of U.S.-made armored vehicles to Greek islands which Ankara says should remain demilitarized in line with international treaties.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned, meanwhile, that Turkey wouldn't hold back on defending its rights and interests against Greece.\n\nTurkish media on Sunday published aerial images that they said showed the deployment of armored vehicles by Greece to the Aegean islands of Samos and Lesbos, heightening tensions between the two NATO countries that have a history of rivalry. Turkish officials say the deployment is in violation of the islands' nonmilitary status according to international law.\n\nTurkish officials summoned Greek Ambassador Christodoulos Lazaris to the Turkish Foreign Ministry on Monday, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported. It said Turkey also filed a protest with Washington, but didn't provide details.\n\nErdogan accused Greece of engaging in acts of provocation against Turkey.\n\n“We will not fail to defend our country’s rights and interests against Greece by using all the means at our disposal, when necessary,” Erdogan said following a Cabinet meeting.\n\nTurkey and Greece have decades-old disputes over an array of issues, including territorial claims in the Aegean Sea and disputes over the airspace there. The disputes have brought them to the brink of war three times in the last half-century.\n\nTensions flared in 2020 over exploratory drilling rights in areas of the Mediterranean Sea — where Greece and Cyprus claim exclusive economic zones — leading to a naval standoff.\n\nMore recently, Turkey has accused Greece of violating international agreements by militarizing islands in the Aegean Sea. It has also accused Greek surface-to-air missiles of locking on to Turkish F-16 fighter jets carrying out a reconnaissance mission in international airspace — an accusation Greece has rejected.\n\nAthens says it needs to defend the islands — many of which lie close to Turkey’s coast — against a potential attack from Turkey.\n\nA Greek government official told The Associated Press that Greece “fully respects” its international obligations, adding that the Greek ambassador told his interlocuters that “Greece is not the country that is threatening its neighbor with war or assembling a large landing force on its coastline as Turkey has done.”\n\nThe official added that Turkey “continues to violate Greece’s sovereignty with its continuous violations of its airspace and overflights of Greek territory.” The official, who wasn't authorized to speak publicly to the news media, made the remarks on condition of anonymity.\n\nTurkish media reports quoted security officials as saying 23 of the armored vehicles were sent to Lesbos and 18 others were sent to Samos.\n\nMeanwhile, Greek authorities said a six-year-old migration agreement between Turkey and the European Union remains in effect despite an escalating dispute between the two neighbors over the treatment of refugees.\n\nNotis Mitarachi, the migration affairs minister, said Greece will continue to observe the 2016 deal that allows it to send back most migrants travelling illegally from nearby Turkey.\n\n“It is clear that for those coming from Syria, Afghanistan, Somalia, Pakistan and Bangladesh, that Turkey is a safe country,” Mitarachi said. “Unfortunately, smugglers are still ‘selling tickets’ to people from those countries.”\n\nSpeaking at the U.N. General Assembly, Erdogan last week accused Greece of committing “crimes against humanity” by carrying out potentially deadly expulsions of migrants travelling from the Turkish mainland to nearby Greek islands.\n\nGreek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis described the claims as “absurd,” charging Turkey with “weaponizing” migration to apply political pressure on Greece and other European countries.\n\n———\n\nDerek Gatopoulos reported from Athens, Greece.",

    "Turkey Signals Possible Rapprochement With Syria": "Recently there have been signs of reconciliation between Turkey and Syria, which have been at odds for more than a decade as Ankara supported Syrian rebel forces fighting Damascus.\n\nPro-government daily Hurriyet reported September 16 that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had expressed a wish to meet his Syrian counterpart, Bashar al-Assad, at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Summit in Uzbekistan, although Assad was not there.\n\n\"I wish Assad had come to Uzbekistan; I would have spoken to him,\" Erdogan said in a closed meeting of his ruling Justice and Development Party, according to Hurriyet columnist Abdulkadir Selvi.\n\nAlso, last month, Erdogan reportedly said he would never rule out dialogue with Syria, adding that \"we should take further steps with Syria.\"\n\nReuters reported September 15 that Hakan Fidan, head of Turkey’s National Intelligence Organization, had met multiple times with his counterpart, Syrian National Security Bureau Chairman Ali Mamlouk, in Damascus in recent weeks, according to four sources.\n\n‘Change in rhetoric’\n\nGonul Tol, the director of the Middle East Institute's Center for Turkish Studies, told VOA these developments are not new, as Turkey has been working closely with the Assad regime since 2016.\n\n\"I think the new thing that we're seeing right now is the change in rhetoric. We are hearing from Turkish officials more vocally that normalization with the regime is a possibility,\" Tol said during an interview via phone in response to questions about Erdogan’s recent statement regarding relations with Syria.\n\n\"But, in reality, if you look at all the developments that have been happening since 2016, I don't think this is shocking.\"\n\nTol said that since Erdogan started aligning his party with the nationalists to consolidate power, his top priority has shifted from toppling the Assad regime to curbing Kurdish advances in northern Syria.\n\n\"To realize that goal, he needed not only a Russian green light but also he had to work closely with the regime itself. … So, there was a tacit understanding between the two—while Erdogan attacks the Kurds, Assad looks the other way,\" Tol said.\n\nTurkey has conducted four military operations in Syria since 2016, and it considers the armed Kurdish YPG militia, a key part of the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces in northern Syria to be a national security threat.\n\nAnkara views the Syrian Democratic Forces to be a Syrian offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, which both Turkey and the United States have designated a terrorist organization.\n\nNATO member Turkey has a military presence in large swaths of northern Syria. Damascus considers Turkey an occupying power and calls for its unconditional withdrawal from Syria.\n\nMilitary incursion\n\nErdogan announced plans in June to launch a new military incursion in northern Syria, targeting the Tal Rifaat and Manbij areas to form a safe zone along the Syrian border. But that has not happened yet.\n\nRussian and pro-Syrian government forces have a presence in these areas, and Russia has not endorsed Turkey's operation.\n\n\n\nAron Lund, a fellow at Century International and Middle East analyst at the Swedish Defense Research Agency, thinks that Erdogan saw an opportunity for a new military operation while the U.S. and Russia mostly focused on Ukraine.\n\nLund notes that Ankara does not need to ask for Washington’s green light as the United States is not involved with the SDF forces in the area where Turkey is eyeing an operation.\n\n\"Erdogan felt that Russia has weakened and is under more international pressure, so they won't be able to bring the same level of push back in Syria. So, this is basically a good moment to go after the Syrian Democratic Forces because the United States and the Europeans will offer more muted criticism than they would normally do and the Russians will be more open to negotiating at Assad's expense,\" Lund told VOA in a conversation.\n\n\"But Russia successfully parried that and drew Erdogan into a negotiation process where the counter demand is that he must talk to Assad, or not Assad personally perhaps, but some form of normalization of their relationship,\" Lund added.\n\nRussian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov said last Monday that Moscow is willing to organize a meeting between Syrian Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad and Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu.\n\n\"We think that [a foreign minister-level meeting] would be useful. We are talking about establishing contacts, now so far through the military and intelligence services — there have been such contacts,\" Bogdanov said, responding to a question on the possibility of such a meeting.\n\nOn the other hand, Mekdad told Sputnik on Saturday that there was no contact or meeting with the Turkish officials during the UNGA. “There is no negotiation, no contact, at least nothing at the level of foreign ministers,\" Mekdad said.\n\nMekdad also accused Turkey of not fulfilling the agreed commitments in the Astana process without elaborating on them. Erdogan, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, and Russian President Vladimir Putin came together in Tehran for Astana talks in July.\n\n\"The only obstacle to the peace process is Turkey's lack of commitment,” Mekdad told Sputnik on the sidelines of the UNGA.\n\nRefugees’ return\n\nTurkey's pro-government daily, Sabah, reported on September 17 that Syrian and Turkish intelligence officials discussed several issues, including the completion of Syria’s new constitution process, revoking its expropriation law that allowed Syria’s government to confiscate property left behind by refugees, and the safe return of those refugees from Syria. Turkey hosts 3.7 million Syrian refugees, the largest refugee population in the world.”\n\nTurkey’s state-run Disaster and Emergency Management Authority announced that over 68,000 briquette houses have been built in Syria for the return of the refugees.\n\nInternational rights groups, including Amnesty International, say war-torn Syria is still not safe for return.\n\nAaron Stein, a Turkey expert and the chief content officer at Metamorphic Media, says that the parameters of Turkish foreign policy on Syria have not changed since 2016, but what has changed is that domestic political dynamics in Turkey have gotten so bad for Erdogan’s party.\n\nStein cited rising anti-Syrian refugee sentiment in Turkey and the country’s economic crisis, with an official inflation last month of 80.2%.\n\n\n\nThe next presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next June, but the opposition parties are calling for snap elections, which Erdogan has dismissed. The six-opposition-party alliance against Erdogan has promised to return Syrian refugees humanely. On the other hand, the far-right Victory Party calls for forced deportations of Syrian refugees, blaming them for the rising food prices.\n\n\"No Turkish person cares about Bashar al-Assad. What people care about in Turkey is the cost of living is going up, and that food prices are out of control and wages are remaining stagnant,\" Stein told VOA.\n\nStein said he does not expect any real progress on Turkey and Syria rapprochement and added, \"I think the value for Erdogan now is that he can tell constituents he is working on a problem.\"\n\nThis story originated in VOA's Turkish Service.",
    "‘Hostile narrative’: Turkey slams Greek PM’s UN remarks": "Ankara accuses Athens of distorting facts after Greek PM says Turkey is undermining regional peace and stability.\n\nTurkey has condemned remarks by Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis who accused Ankara of undermining peace and stability in the Eastern Mediterranean region and playing a “destabilising role”.\n\nLong-existing tensions between the two countries have flared up recently. Greece complained to NATO and the United Nations this month over what it called “inflammatory” rhetoric.\n\n“Unfortunately this statement [by Mitsotakis] was yet another example of distortion of facts and hostile narrative against Turkiye. Turkiye’s role in its region and beyond is well appreciated by the international community,” the Turkish delegation at the United Nations General Assembly said on Friday, using the country’s official name.\n\nThe two nations – North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies but historic foes – have been at odds for decades over a range of issues including where their continental shelves start and end, energy resources, overflights in the Aegean Sea, the status of demilitarised islands and divided Cyprus.\n\nDuring his address to the UNGA, Mitsotakis said Turkey’s leadership “seems to have a strange fixation with my country”.\n\n“They threaten that Turkey will come at night if it so decides. This is the language of an aggressor. From the UN I would like to address … the Turkish people directly: ‘Greece poses no threat to your country. We are not your enemies, we are neighbours. Let us move forward,” he said.\n\nThe Turkish delegation to the UN said Ankara does not challenge the territorial integrity or unity of Greece, calling it “a false propaganda”.\n\n“However, Turkiye does challenge Greece to enter into an honest and meaningful dialogue in accordance with international law to address not one but all legally interrelated Aegean disputes,” it said.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused Greece this week of “crimes against humanity”, referring to its treatment of refugees, and earlier this month of occupying islands in the Aegean Sea that have a demilitarised status.",
    "Russian men flee the country. Many are showing up in Istanbul": "Russian men flee the country. Many are showing up in Istanbul\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ozan Kose/AFP via Getty Images Ozan Kose/AFP via Getty Images\n\nISTANBUL, Turkey — Russian men continue to flee the country, by land or air, days after President Vladimir Putin's announcement to mobilize additional forces to bolster his flailing war in Ukraine.\n\nAt Istanbul's main airport, a constant stream of Russian men came through the arrivals terminal. Istanbul is a destination of choice because it is one of few places where Russians can travel to without visas, with a long history of Russian tourism.\n\nTurkey, a member of NATO, has sought to cast itself as a neutral power broker between Moscow and Kyiv, and refused to join Western countries in economic sanctions on Russia. Since the beginning of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, many anti-war Russians have settled here, along with refugees from Ukraine.\n\nFlights from Russia to Turkey are sold out for the next several weeks, despite skyrocketing prices. But that hasn't stopped people from finding ways to get out, not only from Russian cities like Moscow, Sochi, Makhachkala and Yekaterinburg but also through neighboring countries Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Belarus and Georgia.\n\nThose who spoke to NPR, at Istanbul Airport, didn't want to reveal their names out of fear of the Russian government. Just last week, Putin signed a law that sentenced those who refused to serve, or evaded service, to 10 years in prison. The men NPR spoke to described long lines at airports and border crossings because of the sheer number of crowds and because of interrogation by Russian authorities.\n\nOne 32-year-old man who flew from St. Petersburg, Russia, told NPR that his flight was \"completely full of men, from 20 and then till 50.\"\n\n\"And all men stopped and — we were interrogated by police,\" he said.\n\n\"There was questions about, for example, when did you buy this ticket? What's the purpose? And the second line, they asked, did you [serve] in the military? When? And did you receive the post that you need to go serve?\" alluding to the conscription notices being served.\n\nA hurried dash to the border, and packed light\n\nNearly all the men said they had packed very light, trying to convince Russian authorities that they were leaving for short trips, and not to evade fighting in the war.\n\nMost said they have no future plans, and limited money. Those with families said their priority was to get settled and then try to bring their families out of Russia as well.\n\nA 35-year-old man, who left his family behind in Irkutsk, near Lake Baikal in Siberia, drove first to the Mongolian border, where he waited six hours to cross. In Mongolia, he said, he ran into several of his friends who were also fleeing, before he caught a flight to Istanbul.\n\nSome men said they decided to leave the country as soon as they heard the conscription announcement last Wednesday. The man from Irkutsk said he waited a few days to see what would happen, but once his friends started getting rounded up at night, he made the decision to go.\n\n\"They aren't just taking the reservists, but also men who have no military history and even those with more than three children,\" he said.\n\nRussian authorities, including Putin, had assured the public that only those with prior military service, no illnesses and fewer than three children would be called upon to serve.\n\nSeveral men told NPR that those who speak up against the war and mobilization are being arrested, beaten in custody and then sent to be drafted in the war — which is why women have been overwhelmingly taking part in the recent public protests in Russia.\n\nIt's about to get worse\n\nNearly everyone who spoke to NPR said they believed the situation is going to get worse, that a full mobilization is imminent.\n\nRussia is now conducting what it claims are referendums — considered illegal under international law — in occupied Ukrainian territories on whether to formally join Russia. The 32-year-old man from St. Petersburg told NPR many in Russia see it as the first step for Putin to annex those areas as part of Russia.\n\n\"Then of course the Ukrainians will attack those areas because actually it's their territory. Then after that, I think [Putin will] decide 'OK, they attacked our territory,' and he'll make the full mobilization,\" he said.\n\nAnother man, in a hurry to leave the airport, only said, \"everything is worse than you know and Russian men are going anywhere they can now.\"\n\nOne 36-year-old man from Moscow told NPR that his reason to leave was not just because he didn't want to fight, but that it was his way of not supporting the military campaign.\n\n\"If you are against the war, the best thing to do is try to get out from there and don't support it as we can, not pay taxes or don't work in Russian companies, etc.,\" he said.\n\nJust a few said they were hopeful that there would be a peace agreement to end the war, and hoped to wait it out before eventually returning home.",

    "Turkey Is No Friend Of India; Modi Must Decipher Erdogan’s ‘Dangerous Ambitions’ That Threaten India & Beyond": "Opinion Article By Padma Shri KN Pandita\n\nSince Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan began to believe that he had a divine mission of reviving the lost grandeur of the Ottoman Empire, he concluded that a road to achieving that ambition lay through the labyrinth of Islamic revivalism.\n\nIn his college days, he was influenced by the Islamic Brotherhood Movement. His pro-Islamist reach is also because of the repeated refusal of the European Union to admit Turkey as a regular member. Deep inside, his inclination towards Islamism springs more from vengeance and much less from conviction in all Islam claims.\n\n“The mask of pro-Europeanism started to erase after continuous attempts by Turkey to be a part of the EU failed. After the 2011 Arab Spring, Erdogan asserted his support for Islamist political forces in the West Asia and North Africa (WANA) region like Mohammad Morsi in Egypt and the ‘Dawn Coalition’ in Libya,” wrote Tahiroglu in Ankara’s Failure.\n\nFirstly, Erdogan supported the Muslim Brotherhood-led Morsi government so much so that when Morsi was deposed in 2013 by al-Sisi in a military coup, and the latter became the president, Erdogan refused to recognize Sisi as a legitimate ruler of Egypt.\n\nSecondly, when the crackdown on Muslim Brotherhood leadership began under Sisi, many of its leaders and sympathizers relocated to Turkey. Thirdly, Erdogan’s support of the Muslim Brotherhood has been one of the main issues of contention between Turkey and its relations with the Arabs.\n\nThe UAE, Jordan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia are also on opposing sides of Turkey in Libya. The Arab monarchies are supporting the General Khalifa Haftar-led Libyan National Army.\n\nErdogan, who has regional ambitions in the Eastern Mediterranean, firmly supports the Government of National Accord, which has close relations with the Islamists and the Muslim Brotherhood. Turkey’s relations with Saudi Arabia have been badly affected after the killing of pro-US Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nHowever, Qatar and Turkey share ideological convergence in supporting the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamist groups like Hamas. Qatar also opposed Morsi’s overthrow, like Turkey. This explains the basis of their friendly relationship.\n\nWhile addressing the Sixth Religious Council meeting of the Presidency of Religious Affairs (DİB) in Ankara in November 2019, Erdogan charged that Muslim countries “look for solutions in the Western capitals for their problems, instead of reaching out to their Muslim brothers and sisters for help.” He contemplates new leadership of the ummah (an Arabic word meaning “community”) and discards the existing one.\n\nErdogan has been trying to gather international muscle around the idea of reviving the Muslim ummah, which other Islamic states like Pakistan and Malaysia have actively supported.\n\nErdogan praised the then Pakistan PM Imran Khan for raising the voice for Muslim ummah and the issue of Kashmir at a reception hosted for the participants of the Third Speakers Conference in Istanbul in October 2019.\n\nAt the UN General Assembly in 2019, Erdogan raked up Kashmir and criticized the international community for not paying attention to the issue.\n\nThis speech came just a month after the Indian government revoked Jammu and Kashmir’s special status (Article 370) in August 2019. He also highlighted the intervention issues in Yemen and Qatar and the Israeli settlements in the West Bank.\n\nTurkey, Pakistan, Malaysia, Iran, and Qatar also tried to create an alternative to the Saudi-dominated Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) by holding an Islamic summit in Kuala Lumpur in 2019.\n\nThis angered Riyadh, which pressured Pakistan to opt out of the summit. Erdogan, Mahathir Mohammad, Hassan Rouhani, and Qatar’s Hamad al-Thani participated in the conference.\n\nThe group creates an impression that most of the Arab peninsula monarchs have abandoned the cause of ummah, especially Palestine and Kashmir. Thus Erdogan tries to wear the crown of the leadership of the ummah.\n\nEven as he continues to work towards reviving the old Ottoman glory and ‘Ittihad-I Islam’ (‘Unity of Islam’), Erdogan will have to choose between a pragmatic vis-à-vis an Islamist foreign policy.\n\nIf the Turkish economy returns to high growth rates, Erdogan’s domestic position will be strengthened, and he might still return to his pet Islamist adventures overseas.\n\nWhat Are His Achievements As The President Of Turkey?\n\n“Erdogan has used his unprecedented power to sweep away judges, media outlets, journalists, academics, military officers, and NGOs. According to one estimate, about 120,000 government employees were suspended, dismissed, or imprisoned in the wake of the coup attempt, primarily from the judiciary and education branches.\n\nOver 7,500 soldiers and officers, including over 100 with the rank of brigadier or above, and over 10,000 policemen were sacked, with countless others imprisoned. More than a dozen colleges and universities and 1,000 schools were closed.\n\nThe licenses of 24 radio and TV channels were revoked, and numerous journalists were arrested”, reported BESA Centre Perspectives Paper No. 1,124, March 27, 2019.\n\nSpeaking at the annual coordination meeting of the OIC held in New York recently, Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said, “As the second largest international organization, the OIC is our collective voice against injustice towards Muslims. I reaffirm our strong solidarity with the Uyghur Turks, the Rohingya Muslims, our Kashmiri brothers, and all other Muslim communities facing injustice worldwide.”\n\nIf this is Turkey’s conviction, why did Erdogan speak about only Kashmir in his recent address to the UN General Assembly and skip the Uyghur Turks? OIC is doing politics, not religion.\n\nWhat makes Erdogan hostile to India is not the alleged disregard for the rights of Indian Muslims. No, that is not true. The truth is that Erdogan is very uncomfortable with Indian secular democracy that treats all citizens at par in the eyes of the law. \\\n\nTo Erdogan and the fundamentalists, the Islamic ummah is special specie and has not to be equated with non-Muslims in terms of civic and other rights. Turkey’s policy towards the Cypriots is also hinged on the same line of thinking.\n\nSuccessive governments in Ankara have always sided with Pakistan on the issue of Kashmir. Jagdish N Singh explains Turkey’s interference in the Indian part of Kashmir in his article ‘Erdogan’s Dangerous Ambitions Threaten India and Beyond.’\n\nAs part of its strategy to attain Muslim leadership status, Ankara has also been reaching out to Indian Muslims. Reliable reports indicate that in the recent past, the Erdogan regime has invited several Indian Islamist leaders, including Zakir Naik, to spread Erdogan’s influence across India.\n\nTurkish cleric Serdar Demirel visited Kolkata in 2016 to participate in a protest march organized by Muslims opposed to the Indian government’s bid to apply a Uniform Civil Code throughout the country. Turkey has also funded Indian NGOs to reach out to Muslim students and influence madrasahs and mosques.\n\nAnkara has given special facilities to Kashmiri Muslim students for admission to professional institutes in Ankara. The daughter of the late Ali Shah Geelani is running a website from Ankara which propagates vicious anti-India and anti-Hindu broadcasts.\n\nMost Kashmiri students who have joined educational institutions in Ankara are taken over by the ISI agents and given good brainwashing.\n\nJagadish N Singh concludes his write-up in these words: “The strategy seems to be working. There are indeed Muslims in India who see Erdogan as a leader of the Muslim world, and they celebrated his victory in the presidential elections of June 2018 in a big way.\n\nKashmiri separatist leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq was among the first to offer congratulations. In a speech to an Islamist group run by Erdogan’s son Bilal in 2017, Naik described the Turkish president as “one of the few Muslim leaders who have the guts to support Islam openly.” He said: “O Muslim world, wake up…May Erdogan be the next ruler of the Muslim world.”\n\nAfter the coup attempt in Turkey, Indian Islamic cleric Maulana Salman Hussaini Nadvi endorsed Erdogan, and the Shahi Imam of Delhi Sayyid Ahmed Bukhari met the Turkish ambassador to India and expressed his support. Delegations from Jamaat-e-Islami Hind, Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, the Chishty Foundation, and the India Islamic Cultural Centre (IICC) met the envoy.\n\nThis narrative about Erdogan’s Islamist credentials should help New Delhi understand how it has to deal with the interference of a radical nature. It must not allow a Turkish Islamist like Demirel to join a domestic protest in India.\n\nThis amounts to interfering with India’s internal matters. New Delhi must not tolerate Ankara’s hobnobbing with an Indian Islamist preacher like Zakir Naik, who is alleged to have inspired a terrorist attack on a cafe in Dhaka in 2016 and has been evading an arrest warrant in India. Doing so is tantamount to encouraging terror against India.\n\nPrime Minister Modi and President Erdogan have met on the sidelines of the Samarkand SCO meet. What transpired between the two is not known.\n\nObservers, commenting on Erdogan’s address to the UN General Assembly just two days after his meeting with Modi in Samarkand, have said that Erdogan toned down his Kashmir tantrum and has now referred to bilateral talks between India and Pakistan on the Kashmir issue.\n\nOne wonders whether Modi raised the problems of the Greece-Turkey dispute, Turkey’s use of brute force against Kurd dissidents, and Turkey’s silence on the atrocities perpetrated on the Uighurs of Xinxiang.\n\nErdogan is living in a glass house, throwing stones at others. He may or may not become the topmost leader of the Islamic ummah; that is no worry for the global society.\n\nThe concern is that he is trying to destabilize the secular-democratic dispensation of the world’s largest democracy which also has the second largest Muslim community as part of its society.

Many are going to Turkey, where they do not need a visa to enter.\n\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nIn Russia, there are long lines along the border and flights out of the country are sold out as men of military age try to get out. The exodus follows Russian President Vladimir Putin's decision to mobilize tens of thousands of reservists after the Russian military lost ground to Ukraine's counteroffensive. Many of those fleeing are headed to Turkey, one of the few countries that allows Russians to come in without a visa. NPR's Fatma Tanis was at Istanbul's main airport.\n\nFATMA TANIS, BYLINE: Of the many travelers trickling through international arrivals at Istanbul airport, the Russians stand out. There is a palpable sense of urgency, even frustration, and they're carrying little to no luggage to convince Russian authorities they were leaving for short trips and not to evade fighting in the war. Most of them declined to be interviewed. One man frantically looks around and asks if I have a secret camera on him, and those who did speak didn't want to reveal their names, fearing retribution from the Russian government. I meet two friends in their early 30s who just arrived from Saint Petersburg. They're carrying slim backpacks and small briefcases. I ask one of them if he has a plan.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Don't know yet.\n\nTANIS: This is all you have?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Yes.\n\nTANIS: OK. Did you pack in a rush?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Yeah, actually, yes.\n\nTANIS: Switching to Russian, he says he made the decision to leave the day before after seeing news that police were interrogating men who are leaving the country. It was hard to find a ticket by that point.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Very expensive. Now it's very difficult to buy tickets abroad. It was about 3,000 euro.\n\nTANIS: When they both got to the airport in Saint Petersburg, they were interrogated, too. The other man described what that was like.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: The whole flight was completely full of men, for example, from 20 and then till 50, I think. And all men just stopped and was - we were interrogated by police.\n\nTANIS: He says they were asked when they bought their tickets, the purpose of their trip, whether they'd served in the military before and if they'd received a notice to fight. These men haven't yet. But...\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Yeah, I'm worrying. Yes. About this...\n\nTANIS: You're worried.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: For sure.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Yes. Yeah.\n\nTANIS: Do you think that you can go back to your country any time soon?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: No, I don't believe.\n\nTANIS: So this is it?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Yeah. This is it. Now we can plan something because everything changing very fast.\n\nTANIS: Things are moving quickly in Russia. Just today, President Putin signed a refusal of service law - 10 years in prison for those caught fleeing service. Everyone I spoke with here said they were against the war in Ukraine. They know many people in Russia who are, too, and many others who do support the invasion. The issue has caused rifts between friendships and family. But people who speak out against the war and, more recently, the mobilization have been arrested. There are even reports that they're getting drafted while in police custody to be sent to Ukraine. One 36-year-old man who came from Moscow says the best thing to do is...\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Try to get out from there and don't support it as we can, not pay taxes or don't work in Russian companies, etc.\n\nTANIS: He says Russians who are against the war are very scared now, but they can't stop it. The only options are to leave or go to jail. He says there are no other choices. Fatma Tanis, NPR News, Istanbul.\n\nCopyright © 2022 NPR. All rights reserved.

    "SDF receives more than 100 civilians forcibly deported from Turkey": "The SDF has received more than 100 civilians, including elders, women, and children, in areas close to the front lines in the village of Al-TirwazIya, in the eastern countryside of Raqqa. The 100 civilians had been forcibly deported from the refugee camps located in the Turkish Occupying State.\n\nUpon their arrival in their areas, the SDF provided them with relief assistance and first aid. They were exhausted and stranded. Moreover, some of them were urgently hospitalized since they were tortured by the Turkish police.\n\nOne of the forcibly deported men said, “While I was on my way to work, suddenly the Turkish police arrested me without any accusation. I was subjected to severe torture at the police station, and then they transferred me to a prison-like camp in the desert surrounded by a fence with tight security.”\n\nHe added, “They promised the Syrians to grant them citizenship cards, but they were lying. Turkey treated us badly, and no one defended us. The Turkish police force Syrian refugees to sign a deportation document by which the deportee becomes banned from entering Turkish territory for five years.”\n\nAnother deportee said, “The Turkish army tortured us brutally when we were arrested at the border, some of us fainted due to brutal torture.”\n\nThese criminal practices by the Turkish Occupying State attest to its inhuman nature.",

This is a protected area and we are on an ancient city that is more important than Göbeklitepe. But this house made of concrete was built on this ancient city, which we must protect like our eyes,” Paylan said.\n\nPaylan said that the people living in the region told him that the building in question belonged to the AKP’S Diyarbakır deputy chair Fatma Biçer.\n\n“When you are a member of AKP in this country, you can build a construction on an ancient protected area like this. Culture (and Tourism) Minister, is this how you preserve history? Demolish this building immediately and protect it,” Paylan said.\n\n“What is lost is our common history. I call on the Culture Minister to protect this ancient city, where our ancestors lived, and the story of Anatolia, dating back 10,000 years.\"",
    "What Erdogan’s Unusual Economic Ideas Mean for Turkey": "Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nSign up for our Middle East newsletter and follow us @middleeast for news on the region. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is not the only politician who doesn’t like it when the country’s banks charge people relatively heavily to borrow money. What sets him apart is his unorthodox belief in low interest rates and determination to wrest control of monetary policy from central bankers. The result: A succession of benchmark rate cuts that has fueled runaway inflation and precipitated a collapse in the currency.\n\n1. What’s Erdogan’s beef with high interest rates?\n\nHe says that they slow economic growth and fuel inflation. The thesis has unnerved international investors for years. While the country’s spending and credit binge during the pandemic propelled growth, the economy has also suffered from double-digit inflation and unpredictable policy moves. He has also referred to Islamic proscriptions on usury as a basis for his policy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Are his arguments reasonable?\n\nThe point about weaker growth is. When a central bank increases rates, banks are less able to borrow to maintain mandatory reserves and tend to lend at their own elevated rates. This makes loans for businesses rarer and more expensive and so can slow the economy. But Erdogan’s second notion -- that elevated interest rates cause prices to rise -- contradicts conventional economic theories.\n\n3. What’s the basis of Erdogan’s theory?\n\nIt’s likely that it’s partly based on his experience running businesses, mostly in the food industry, before his career as a politician took off. Many Turkish companies borrow relatively heavily to cover operating expenses, making volatility in borrowing costs a source of uncertainty and rate hikes an added expense. In Erdogan’s view, higher rates result in higher prices because businesses have to pass on increased costs to their customers. This makes assumptions that orthodox economists challenge, namely that interest rates make up a significant part of companies’ costs and that producers have sufficient pricing power to impose their will on consumers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Who agrees with Erdogan?\n\nThe argument is based on a theory by Yale University economist Irving Fisher on the relationship between inflation, nominal interest rates and real interest rates. Critics of the neo-Fisherites say that even if their theory had merit, it wouldn’t apply to an economy like Turkey’s, which suffers from chronically high inflation and is reliant on foreign funding. That’s because cutting interest rates reduces the return on investing in Turkish assets, and the local currency tends to weaken when foreigners decide to put their money elsewhere. That increases the cost of imported goods in liras and results in higher prices, or more inflation.\n\n5. What has Erdogan done to put his views into action?\n\nMany central banks have raised borrowing costs to fight inflation after the pandemic. Turkey has gone the other way, cutting its benchmark interest rate by 7 percentage points to 12% in the 13 months to September. Over that period, the lira gradually weakened and inflation accelerated. The government increased the national minimum wage in December and July to limit the hit to households. This further inflamed prices, sending inflation to a 24-year high above 80% in August -- the fourth highest among 120 countries tracked by Bloomberg. Erdogan has held firm, saying what Turkey needs is more investment, production and exports, not higher interest rates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. What’s been the impact on financial markets?\n\nInterest rates on commercial debt began to diverge from benchmark rates as lenders balked at offering ever-cheaper loans when the supply of short-term central bank funding was in doubt. In response, monetary authorities imposed rules to force banks to bring their loan rates closer to the benchmark. They were also obliged to increase their holdings of lira-denominated, fixed-rate government debt. As a result, the cost of lira debt fell, while yields on Turkey’s junk-rated dollar bonds went in the opposite direction.\n\n7. What’s it done to the economy?\n\nHomes, cars and many essential goods became unaffordable for a swathe of Turkey’s 84 million population. Food inflation hit low earners, while the middle class saw a squeeze in living standards. On the flip side, economic growth outperformed Turkey’s peers and unemployment was relatively low due to an abundance of cheap labor. While the stock market rallied, keeping pace with inflation, bond investors have struggled to adjust to a world of 68% real negative yields. The lira hit an all-time low against the dollar in September, even though the central bank has spent an estimated $75 billion to prop up the currency this year, according to calculations by Bloomberg Economics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Could Erdogan reverse course?\n\nErdogan has signaled he’ll do whatever it takes to keep his low-rate policy intact. Finance Minister Nureddin Nebati told investors frustrated by low bond yields they can find good returns in Turkish stocks. With elections looming in 2023, Erdogan is wary of changing course and risking a blowout in borrowing rates that could inflict further pain on consumers. To shore up popular support, he announced a $50 billion project to increase home ownership, introduced a cap on rents, erased some student loans and promised another big minimum wage hike. He’s aware the economy is his biggest challenge, and economists aren’t ruling out a policy rethink after the elections.\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com\n\n©2022 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

    "US designated key operatives of IRGC Quds Force who work with Turkey’s intelligence chief": "Abdullah Bozkurt/Stockholm\n\nThe US designation of a Turkish-based money laundering network run by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force hit the close associates of Turkish intelligence chief Hakan Fidan, a pro-Iranian Islamist figure.\n\nThe designation, announced by the US Treasury in May, sanctioned key operatives of the Quds Force that have secretly been working with Fidan for years. The information provided by US officials corroborated the findings of Turkish police, who had already identified the designated individuals as part of the Quds Force network during a criminal probe run by public prosecutors between 2011 and 2014.\n\nAccording to the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), Turkish nationals Hakkı Selçuk Şanlı, Abdulhamit Çelik and Seyyid Cemal Gündüz worked with IRGC official Behnam Shahriyari in an international oil smuggling and money laundering network that generated hundreds of millions of dollars on behalf of Iran and its proxy Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nThe US move rings alarm bells for Turkish spy master Fidan, a confidant of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan who was groomed in Shiite study circles during his youth and described as a high value asset by the IRGC.\n\nSummary of wiretaps from confidential Quds Force probe reveals how Hakkı Selçuk Şanlı said Turkish intelligence stopped monitoring him after Hakan Fidan, code-named Emin (trusted man) by Quds Force operatives, became the head of Turkish intelligence agency MIT:\n\nThe confidential Turkish probe into the Quds Force had already revealed Fidan’s secret contacts with Quds Force operatives including Şanlı and Shahriyari, the latter operating under the cover name of Sayed Ali Akber Mir Vakili. Shahriyari was part of an illegal cell based in Ankara working closely with Şanlı as well as with Faruk Koca, a former lawmaker, in communicating with Fidan.\n\nIn various intercepted communications, the cell members described Fidan as “Emin,” which means “trusted man” in Turkish. They used burner phones and changed the numbers used for communications every two or three months.\n\nŞanlı was arrested on May 13, 2000 and was sentenced to 12 years, six months in prison for involvement in terrorist plots targeting Turkish and US interests. The trial revealed how he and his associates helped set up the Quds Force network in the 1990s on the order of then-IRGC general Nasir Takipur. The group was designated as a terrorist group under the Turkish name of Tevhid Selam.\n\nBut he was freed in 2004 when the government of then-prime minister and now president Erdoğan pushed an amnesty bill through parliament, reducing sentences for some convicts. He was put to use again by his handlers after keeping a low profile for years and started running several operations including moving funds on behalf of the Quds Force, providing financial support for jailed Quds Force convicts and managing a recruitment and asset development program for Iranian intelligence in Ankara.\n\nThe launch of new operations and reactivating old assets by the Quds Force in Turkey came after a meeting of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Erdoğan in 2008. The Quds Force shifted into high gear after Erdoğan appointed Fidan, who had no experience in intelligence, as the head of intel agency MIT two years later.\n\nIn fact, the criminal probe into the Quds Force, listed under case file no.2011/762, revealed how Iranian and Turkish operatives working for the Quds Force were pleased with the appointment of Fidan as the head spy master.\n\nIn a wiretap dated May 24, 2013, Şanlı said he had been under surveillance by MIT after he got out of prison but that that stopped after Fidan took over the agency. What they did not know, however, was that Turkish police, under orders from veteran counterterrorism prosecutors, were actually looking into the Quds Force after receiving tips about increased illegal activities from local contacts in Turkey as well as terror plot alerts passed to Turkey by the US and Israel.\n\nThe wiretaps, surveillance records, documents and other evidence obtained during that probe exposed senior officials in the Erdoğan government as conspirators in facilitating IRGC Quds Force operations.\n\nLike Şanlı, his associate Çelik also has a long rap sheet in the Turkish criminal justice system. In 1996 Çelik was convicted of killing two opponents of the Iranian regime in Turkey and sentenced to 12 years, six months in prison, though he was released in 2004 as a result of an amnesty. He admitted in testimony in May 2000 as part of the Tevhid Selam probe that he had been trained for over two months in Iran to stage attacks in Turkey and conduct intelligence operations on behalf of Iran.\n\nGündüz, another associate of Şanlı, was also red flagged in the Turkish probe. Married to an Iranian woman, Gündüz has had contacts with Iranian intelligence since the 1980s and established businesses in both Iran and Turkey.\n\nThe IRGC Quds Force case in Turkey never went to trial because the Erdoğan government hushed it up in February 2014 after learning about the probe. The investigating prosecutor was sacked before he had a chance to secure detention warrants for the suspects or file an indictment. The suspects avoided the long arm of the law thanks to the intervention of Erdoğan, who apparently protected pro-Iranian assets and helped their Quds Force handlers escape from Turkey.\n\nIrfan Fidan, the new prosecutor, personally selected by Erdoğan to torpedo the Quds Force probe, dropped all the charges against the Iranian and Turkish nationals who were identified as part of Quds Force cells. Fidan also launched a new criminal case against everyone who was involved in the investigation into the Quds Force and ordered the detention of the police chiefs who uncovered the sophisticated Iranian network in Turkey. Fidan was rewarded by the Erdoğan government for squelching the probe and appointed as a member of the Constitutional Court in 2020.",
    "Turkey: Anti-LGBTQ display reflects nation’s political shift": "ISTANBUL (AP) — The 25-year-old translator by day and trans drag performer by night felt overwhelming panic and anxiety when several thousand demonstrators gathered and marched Sunday in Turkey to demand a ban on what they consider gay propaganda and to outlaw LGBTQ organizations.\n\nThe Big Family Gathering march in the conservative heart of Istanbul attracted parents with children, nationalists, hard-line Islamists and conspiracy theorists. Turkey’s media watchdog gave the event the government’s blessing by including a promotional video that called LGBTQ people a “virus” in its list of public service announcements for broadcasters.\n\n“We need to make all our defense against this LGBT. We need to get rid of it,” said construction worker Mehmet Yalcin, 21, who attended the event wearing a black headband printed with Islam’s testimony of faith. “We are sick of and truly uncomfortable that our children are being encouraged and pulled to this.”\n\nSeeing images from the gathering terrified Willie Ray, the drag performer who is nonbinary, and Willie Ray’s mother, who was in tears after talking to her child. The fear wasn’t misplaced. The Europe branch of the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association ranked Turkey second to last, ahead of only Azerbaijan, in its most recent 49-country legal equality index, saying LGBTQ people endured “countless hate crimes.”\n\n“I feel like I can be publicly lynched,” Willie Ray said, describing the daily sense of dread that comes with living in Istanbul. The performer recalls leaving a nightclub still in makeup on New Year’s Eve and hurrying to get to a taxi as strangers on the street called out slurs and “tried to hunt me, basically.”\n\nSunday’s march was the biggest anti-LGBTQ demonstration of its kind in Turkey, where civil rights for a community more commonly referred to here as LGBTI+ — lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and other gender identities and sexual orientations — have been under assault in the years since an estimated 100,000 people celebrated Pride in Istanbul in 2014.",

    "Can the SCO be Turkey’s alternative to the West?": "Erdogan suggests Turkey will seek full membership of the Russia and China-led Shanghai Cooperation Organisation amid strained ties with the West.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has expressed his NATO-member country’s intention to become a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), suggesting Ankara is seeking alternatives to its problematic ties with the West.\n\nErdogan, who made the remarks after attending last week’s SCO summit in Uzbekistan, was also quoted as saying by the Turkish media that the SCO’s 2023 meeting in India will be a venue to discuss this prospect further.\n\nChina, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Pakistan, India and Uzbekistan are the full members of the of the political, economic, and security organisation.\n\nAfghanistan, Belarus, Iran, and Mongolia are SCO observer countries, while Armenia, Azerbaijan, Cambodia, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Turkey are the bloc’s dialogue partners.\n\n“Our ties with these countries will be moved to a much different position,” Erdogan told reporters on Saturday.\n\nWhen asked by reporters if he meant Turkey would seek to become a member of the organisation, the president said: “Of course, that’s the target.”\n\nThe SCO is not seen as an alternative to NATO, a military alliance with collective defence responsibilities under Article 5 of its founding treaty, which considers an armed attack against one or more members to be considered “an attack against all”.\n\nMensur Akgun, a professor of international relations, told Al Jazeera that the SCO is an hybrid bloc that seeks to prevent a vacuum in Central and South Asia through cooperation.\n\n“It aims to increase dialogue and cooperation, solve problems among its members when needed and stand in solidarity with one another against interventions in the region by outside powers,” he said, adding that the SCO is closer to the model of the European Union than to NATO.\n\n“An organisation that has arch-rivals India and Pakistan under its umbrella would not be able to have automatic military interdependence like NATO has,” Akgun said.\n\nAkgun also said that growing political and economic ties between Turkey and Russia in recent years contributed to Erdogan’s remarks on SCO membership, especially considering Turkey’s often tense relations with Western powers.\n\nTurkey bought Russia’s S-400 defence systems, which prompted US sanctions in addition to Turkey’s removal from a US-led programme developing F-35 fighter jets. Russia is also building Turkey’s first nuclear power plant and the two countries signed an economic cooperation deal in August.\n\nEven though Turkey and Russia backed opposing sides in Syria’s war, the two countries have largely coordinated closely during the conflict.\n\nThe Turkish government has also taken a balanced stance over Moscow’s February invasion of Ukraine. It has provided Ukraine with arms, in particular with drones, but it has not imposed sanctions on Russia and criticised what it calls Western policies “based on provocations” towards Moscow.\n\nAnkara has tried to act as a mediator between Russia and Ukraine since the beginning of the conflict and helped broker an agreement in July for Ukrainian grain ships to sail to outside markets.\n\nStrained ties with the West\n\nGalip Dalay, a nonresident senior fellow at the Middle East Council on Global Affairs, said that Erdogan’s remarks on SCO membership stem from Ankara’s tensions with the West.\n\n“Whenever there is discontent with the West – in particular, with the US [over] the perception that Turkey is treated unfairly – the idea of alternatives come up,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\n“And because of that Ankara currently believes Turkey’s interests are better served by a balancing act between different centres of powers – meaning China, Russia and the West,” Dalay said.\n\nAnkara has also been at odds with the US and certain EU member states over their support for Syrian Kurdish fighters who allied with the West in the fight against ISIL (ISIS) in the war-torn country.\n\nTurkey considers the Syrian Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG), the main part of the anti-ISIL alliance, to be an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which has been fighting against the Turkish state for decades.\n\nErdogan threatened to block Sweden and Finland’s NATO bids over what he said was their support for these groups, but lifted his opposition after a meeting with US President Joe Biden in June.\n\nFollowing the move, Biden expressed support for sales of F-16 jets to Turkey – warplanes currently in use and inferior to the F-35s in development. However, he needs the approval of the US Congress for the move.\n\nIn July, the US House of Representatives approved an amendment creating a new hurdle for Biden’s plan to sell F-16s to Turkey, imposing strict conditions to any sales.\n\nErdogan said last week that his government might consider other options if the US is unable to fulfil its promise to provide the jets.\n\nRecently, escalating tensions in the Mediterranean Sea between NATO members Turkey and Greece have also prompted the EU and the US to condemn Turkey.\n\nAnkara and Athens are at odds over an array of issues such as overflights, the status of islands between the two countries, maritime boundaries and hydrocarbon resources.\n\nHowever, Akgun believes that Turkey is unlikely to gain SCO membership for several reasons, considering the bloc’s structure and purposes.\n\n“Turkey’s membership to the SCO does not seem possible as a NATO member and an EU candidate, but also because it is currently geographically and politically irrelevant to the SCO’s purposes of existence,” Akgun said.",
    "Freight costs rise as Turkey eyes multimodal infrastructure via Istanbul Canal": "For the first time in nearly 40 years, Turkey will increase the fees for ships transiting the Bosphorus on 7 October, by 500%, to $4/tonne.\n\nThis, however, is just the start of price hikes for vessels transiting the Turkish Straits. In June 2021, construction of the Istanbul Canal began. This controversial infrastructure project will create a man-made canal just west of the Bosphorus.\n\nThe canal will be 45 km in length, 360m wide, and 20.75m deep, creating a smooth navigable means to bypass the Bosphorus Strait. Its anticipated capacity is 160 vessels a day.\n\nThe stated aim of the canal is to reduce congestion on the Bosphorus, and the potential for environmental disasters from ships carrying dangerous goods.\n\nPlans for related infrastructure are extensive: an estimated $20bn is planned for major real estate development of land surrounding the canal and the construction of various amenities, including a marina, container port and logistics hub.\n\nAs the largest infrastructure project the country has ever seen, it will form part of a multimodal transport system in which Turkey aims to present itself as a logistics hub, with the nearby Istanbul Airport also expected to be linked.\n\nControversy surrounding the project stems from its potential impact on the 1936 Montreux Convention, which limits the charges Ankara can levy on vessels using the Turkish Straits and regulates the movement of military vessels.\n\nThe Turkish government remains circumspect about whether the Istanbul Canal will be governed under the Convention, and indeed whether the Convention could be repealed entirely.\n\nDr Tuba Eldem, research fellow at the Centre for Applied Turkish Studies, explained to The Loadstar that “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has advanced the importance of the project. Now that there are sanctions on the Northern corridor, Turkey expects more trade coming from China through central Asia”.\n\nFurther, Dr Eldem explained: “Now that Russia is not providing energy through Nordstream 2, more energy for Europe will come through the Turkish Straits. If this war continues for a long time, some of this energy would come through the Istanbul Canal.”\n\nAs transit fees will be charged for the use of the canal, Dr Eldem explained that the waterway will make the movement of goods between the Mediterranean and Black Sea much more expensive for shippers.\n\nIt is still unknown what the exact fees will be, but Ankara expects to generate $8bn in annual revenues from the canal.\n\nTurkey believes shippers will prefer to use the canal instead of the Bosphorus due to easier navigation, reduced congestion and decreased risk.\n\nHowever, it is unknown yet whether Turkey will limit the use of the Bosphorus in order to push ships to the canal to generate higher revenues.\n\nA further potential controversy is that the Montreux Convention regulates the movement of naval vessels in and out of the Black Sea.\n\nBy providing an alternative route outside the Convention, Turkey, a NATO signatory, would acquire sole control of the movement of warships in and out of the Black Sea, giving it substantial leverage to negotiate directly with major powers.\n\nDr Eldem argued: “The project gains more importance in the geopolitical reordering after the invasion of Ukraine.” She explained the construction of the canal “is a signal of a shift Westwards for Turkey”.\n\nA former senior European defence official told The Loadstar: “The building of the canal would be a net positive, relatively, for the West.”\n\nHowever, the official noted: “The fact that the canal is not bound by treaty means there could be escalation.” Putin has cited the importance of preserving the Convention to “ensure regional stability and security”, as the new canal could allow NATO increased access into the Black Sea.\n\n“The most dramatic impact will be on Russia, as the state that most frequently uses the Turkish Strait,” said Dr Eldem. “While the canal will give Turkey more leverage, it may cause problems with Moscow in the short-term, so I don’t think Turkey will be willing to try any moves that could be interpreted as a violation of Montreux in the current political context.”\n\nChina is thought to have shown the most interest in funding the project, with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the Bank of China cited as potential financiers.\n\nDiscussions of the construction have been a priority item on the agenda of China’s diplomatic visits to Turkey. HSBC, as well as financial institutions from the Netherlands, Belgium, and Russia have also declared interest in funding the project.\n\n“Everyone is afraid of China’s contribution” said Dr Eldem, “and whether China will put conditionality on the funding as a kind of leverage.” The European defence official, however, explained that “if Turkey didn’t want Chinese military leverage, they wouldn’t let it”.\n\nEnvironmental groups have heavily criticised the project, citing potential disruption of Istanbul’s water supplies, triggering earthquakes, deforestation, and destruction of marine life by changes to the mineral and nutrient balance of the Black Sea.",
    "Turkey: Plastic Recycling Harms Health, Environment": "(Istanbul) – Plastic recycling in Turkey is harming the health of many people and degrading the environment for everyone, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today.\n\nThe 88-page report, “‘It’s as If They’re Poisoning Us’: The Health Impacts of Plastic Recycling in Turkey,” documents the consequences of the Turkish government’s ineffective response to the health and environmental impacts of plastic recycling on the right to health. Air pollutants and toxins emitted from recycling affect workers, including children, and people living near recycling facilities.\n\nThe government fails to enforce laws and regulations that require strict licensing and regular, thorough inspections of recycling facilities and occupational health, greatly exacerbating facilities’ impacts on health and the environment. Plastic waste imported from the European Union is significantly contributing to these abuses.\n\n“Turkey has regulations to protect people and the environment, but a lack of enforcement is increasing people’s risk of serious, life-long health conditions,” said Krista Shennum, Gruber Fellow in the Environment and Human Rights division at Human Rights Watch. “The government of Turkey needs to do more to meet its obligations to protect people from the effects of toxic plastic recycling.”\n\nHuman Rights Watch interviewed 64 people, including 26 who currently work or previously worked in plastic recycling facilities in Istanbul and Adana and 21 who live near plastic recycling facilities. Five of the workers were children at the time of the interview, and four adults interviewed began working in a plastic recycling facility as children.\n\nWorkers and residents of neighboring communities described respiratory problems, severe headaches, skin ailments, lack of protective equipment, and little to no access to medical treatment for occupational illnesses. Many of the facilities Human Rights Watch visited were located dangerously close to homes, in contravention of Turkish laws and environmental regulations.\n\nTo be recycled, plastic waste is shredded, washed, melted at high temperatures, and then turned into pellets. This process emits air pollutants and toxins that, without adequate protections, can contribute to short-term health problems, including asthma, difficulty breathing, and eye irritation. Scientists have also linked exposure to these toxins to an increased risk of cancer, neurological impacts, and reproductive system harm. In addition, plastics are made from fossil fuels and toxic additives and also release significant amounts of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to the climate crisis.\n\nSince the Chinese government banned plastic waste imports in 2018, many countries in the Global North have scrambled to find new destinations for their plastic waste. Because of its geographic proximity, strong trade relations with the European Union, and status as an Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development member, Turkey has become the primary destination for the EU’s plastic waste, receiving nearly half of the EU’s plastic waste exports in 2020 and 2021.\n\nMany recycling facility workers are from the most vulnerable populations in Turkey and include children, refugees, and undocumented migrants. Some workers, including undocumented migrants, said they do not have access to medical services if they get sick or are injured in the workplace. Fear over losing their jobs made workers wary about raising concerns with their employers over harmful working conditions, including working without access to personal protective equipment.\n\nHuman Rights Watch found that children work in plastic recycling facilities in Turkey even though Turkish law prohibits them from working in such hazardous conditions and the exposure to pollution and toxins is especially damaging to their health.\n\n“There’s a huge cauldron where they’re cooking the material, they keep adding water which comes back up as steam,” said a 20-year-old waste picker in Adana who had worked at a plastic recycling center as a child. “When I inhaled that, it would feel like my lungs were squeezed and under pressure … I stopped working there two months ago, but I still have a problem with breathing.”\n\nResidents of neighboring communities said intense odors and pollution from plastic recycling prevent them from sleeping, opening their windows, and spending time outside.\n\n“My 27-year-old sister died of colon cancer, this was 10 years ago,” said a 35-year-old man whose family lived for decades near recycling facilities. He believes that living near recycling facilities is a factor in the deaths of four relatives. “My brother died at 34 years of lung cancer four years ago. I believe it is the effect of the recycling plants.”\n\nHuman Rights Watch found that workers and nearby residents are not provided with basic information about levels of toxins in their environment, risks from those toxic exposures, or ways to minimize those risks despite the law requiring Turkish authorities and employers to monitor conditions and share this information.\n\nWhile it is mandatory for plastic recycling facilities to acquire licenses and permits from the relevant authorities, it is unclear exactly how many meet this requirement and how many operate without licenses. Licenses require adherence to environmental and occupational health standards that would limit health risks. For licensed facilities, environmental, occupational health, and labor inspections often fail to adequately examine environmental and health conditions.\n\nHuman Rights Watch wrote to key ministries and municipalities in Turkey to share initial research findings and seek information on plastic recycling facilities, air quality data, inspection reports, rates of illness related to toxic exposure, plastic waste import data, and child labor. In some cases, Human Rights Watch did not receive a response. In other instances, the responses received were incomplete and did not provide answers to the questions posted. For example, the Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change said that it had undertaken thousands of inspections of waste disposal and recycling facilities since 2018 and fined facilities and closed unlicensed ones. Yet, the ministry did not provide specific data for plastic recycling facilities, and the findings of Human Rights Watch's report show the need for more resolute steps to address pervasive violations of the right to health.\n\nThe Turkish Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change should conduct independent and thorough inspections of recycling facilities to ensure compliance with environmental regulations and to make information about the risks of air pollution and toxin exposure readily available and accessible, Human Rights Watch said. The Ministry of Labor and Social Security should enforce Turkey’s ban on child labor in hazardous workplaces, including plastic recycling facilities.\n\nCountries that export plastic waste, including those in the EU, should take steps to more effectively manage their plastic waste domestically, rather than shipping their waste to countries with weak or inadequate government enforcement of environmental and labor regulations. The Turkish government should reinstate the ban on imported plastic waste for recycling, which it introduced in July 2021 but quickly lifted.\n\n“Europe’s wealthiest countries are sending their trash to Turkey, consigning some of Turkey’s most vulnerable communities, including children, refugees and migrants, to serious environmental and health risks,” Shennum said. “The EU and individual plastic-exporting countries should take responsibility for their own plastic waste, end the export of plastic to Turkey, and reduce the amount of plastic they produce and consume.”",

    "Queer singer tries to create space for discussion in Turkey": "September 23, 2022\n\nIstanbul, Turkey — In early August, Fatih Karaca, better known as Mabel Matiz, stood on stage in Istanbul. As the first chords of one of his most famous songs, \"Alaimisema,\" an old Turkish word meaning “rainbow,” began to swell, he spoke to the sold-out crowd.\n\n“Humans are creatures that are very susceptible to excluding the other, to alienating the other, to becoming hostile, to excluding what they do not know,” Matiz said. “But underneath all that, I think we all know that we are the same deep down.”\n\nMatiz knows this intimately. Despite his queer identity, Matiz is beloved by fans across the political and religious spectrum. He says his music creates a space where people in Turkey can explore controversial topics — a space ever-rarer in a politically and culturally polarized country.\n\n“I have worked hard to create music that can share a common point with everyone,” Matiz told Al-Monitor.\n\nHe was born in 1985 in a small town in southern Turkey. A solitary child, he says music was his “savior,” a way to explore the wider world and a form of expression. When young he had a stutter, but when he sang, it disappeared.\n\nWhen he moved to Istanbul in the early 2000s to study dentistry, the city teemed with youthful energy. Many were hopeful that the election of the Justice and Development Party (AKP) government in 2002 would lead to a more liberal environment, as the party then espoused a more open stance on rights for minority groups, including LGBTQ people.\n\nIn 2008, he started a page on MySpace, then a popular social media site, under the pseudonym Mabel Matiz. Mabel was a name from a character in a book by Buket Uzuner, \"Kumral Ada Mavi Tuna.\" Matiz was derived from the ancient Greek word for “drunkard.”\n\nWithin two years, Matiz was one of the most popular names on Turkey’s MySpace. Listeners and producers were taken by his fusion of pop, rock, and Turkish folk. His lyrics wove together folklore and poetry with urban stories.\n\n“My songs can talk about anything. They could talk about a story in a village or the back streets of Berlin, they could talk about a love affair or a more spiritual, divine kind of love,” he said.\n\nIn 2011, the underground success of his first album, “Mabel Matiz,” allowed him to pivot full-time to music. Now, Matiz has four albums, over 2 million monthly listeners on Spotify, and his YouTube videos get more than 5 million views.\n\nBut in the meanwhile, Turkey has seen a dramatic rise in homophobia, as the AKP seeks to shore up its conservative base.\n\nLast week, Turkey’s largest-ever anti-LGBT rally took place in Istanbul, with signs that called queer people “perverts.”\n\n“In the last two years, the government has ramped up the anti-LGBT [stance],” Kenan Sharpe, an academic who studies Turkish pop culture, told Al-Monitor. “It’s become a specific policy of theirs, this culture war they’re trying to start.”\n\nFollowing the Gezi Park protests of 2013, the government has hardened its rhetoric against LGBTQ people, many of whom joined the protests.\n\nIn 2021, Erdogan said there was “no such thing as LGBT” people in Turkey. Pride marches have been banned since 2015.\n\n“The LGBTI+ community is under great pressure,\" Matiz said. \"What happens every year at Pride saddens me.”\n\nDespite the increasingly hostile climate, on July 1 — just days after police violently cracked down on this year’s Pride events — Matiz released his controversial recent hit \"Karakol\" or \"Copshop,\" gaining more than 17 million views to date.\n\nThe video depicts a young man leaning on Matiz’s knee as Matiz sings that his heart has been “put in the police station,” and his love put in a grave. He compares his lover to forbidden fruit.\n\nThe song and video were met with an outpouring of both praise and outrage. The head of Turkey’s broadcasting watchdog RTUK reportedly called television stations, demanding they not air the clip.\n\nDespite that, Matiz was pleased that the song got people talking.\n\nAccording to Ozan Korkmaz, Matiz’s manager, censorship has failed to scrap the song's impact as it inspired rare and important conversations.\n\n“I think it is very, very critical to make people think about it, talk a little, feel something different even within themselves, by throwing something new at them from time to time,” Korkmaz told Al-Monitor.\n\nAs he works on a fifth album that’s slated to be released in early 2023, Matiz says he will write more songs exploring similar themes.\n\n“I'm not afraid,” he said. “There is no room for such fear in my life or my head.”",
    "3 Key Reasons Why Turkey Is Keen To Reset Its Ties With India & Keep Its Pro-Pakistan, Pro-Kashmir Sentiments On Backburner": "Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar met his Turkish counterpart Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu in New York on September 21, just a few hours after Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in the United Nations General Assembly that it is “unfortunate” that India and Pakistan haven’t been able to establish peace 75 years after independence and hoped for “fair and permanent peace” in Kashmir would have been unthinkable few months ago.\n\nGoing by the past practices over the last three years, whenever Erdogan talks about Kashmir, Indian officials immediately meet top leaders of Greece or Cyprus, or Armenia, with whom Turkey has territorial disputes and human rights concerns.\n\nBut this time, the two foreign ministers meeting on the same day of Erdogan’s UN speech suggests that “The Pakistan factor” in India-Turkey relations is getting diluted, and both New Delhi and Ankara are recalibrating their policies toward one another in the face of the ongoing geopolitical changes.\n\nIt also seems that Turkey (Turkey officially changed its name to Türkiye in June 2022) is getting increasingly disenchanted with its strategic ally Pakistan.\n\nIt may be noted that soon after Article 370, which provided special status under the Indian constitution to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, was abrogated by the Indian government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in August 2019, Ankara has been raising the Kashmir issue in various forums.\n\nPresident Erdogan first broached the issue at the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in September 2019. Since then, he has repeatedly been talking about the Kashmir issue in the UNGA every year.\n\nIn 2020, the Turkish President said, “The Kashmir conflict, which is also key to the stability and peace of South Asia, is still a burning issue…We are in favor of solving this issue through dialogue within the framework of the United Nations resolutions, especially in line with the expectations of the people of Kashmir.”\n\nThis he did, knowing full well that the permanent five members of the UN Security Council and the world at large do not wish to interfere in a matter that they believe falls squarely within India’s domestic affairs.\n\nIn 2021, he repeated the same at the UNGA by saying, “We maintain our stance in favor of solving the ongoing problem in Kashmir for 74 years, through dialogue between the parties and within the framework of relevant United Nations resolutions.”\n\nIn fact, outside the United Nations, the Turkish President even did not hesitate to say that “India right now has become a country where massacres are widespread. What massacres? Massacres of Muslims. By who? Hindus.”\n\nIn his February 14, 2020, speech before a joint session of Pakistan’s parliament, Erdogan stated: We have never forgotten and will never forget the help, which the Pakistani people extended, by sharing their own bread during our War of Independence. And now, Kashmir is and will be the same for us. It was Çanakkale yesterday, and it is Kashmir today, [there is] no difference”.\n\nErdogan’s actions had invited India’s strong reactions. Prime Minister Modi countered by holding meetings with the president of Cyprus and the Prime Ministers of Armenia and Greece on the side-lines of the world body’s annual meetings.\n\nIndia reminded Turkey that unlike Ankara, which invaded and occupied part of the sovereign nation of Cyprus in 1974, New Delhi had not undertaken any such measures with regard to Kashmir.\n\nBesides, Modi later canceled his planned visit to Turkey in October 2019, and a lucrative $2.3 billion naval deal with a Turkish defense company was terminated. India also cut its other defense exports to Turkey, which included dual-use weaponry such as explosives and detonators.\n\nFrom then on, India also significantly reduced its imports from Turkey. And what was more, India entered into a defense agreement worth $40 million with Armenia, Turkey’s traditional rival in the region. It included four SWATHI weapon locating radars developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).\n\nIndia-Turkey Resetting Ties\n\nAgainst this background, this year’s speech at the UNGA by President Erdogan on Kashmir was very mild and neutral, experts say. “India and Pakistan, after having established their sovereignty and independence 75 years ago, still haven’t established peace and solidarity between one another. This is very unfortunate. We hope and pray that a fair and permanent peace and prosperity will be established in Kashmir,” Erdogan said.\n\nHe, unlike in the past, did not support Pakistan’s position that the Kashmir issue must be resolved under the dated UN Security Council resolution of the 1950s.\n\nDiplomatic sources point out that Erdogan’s mellowness on Kashmir was due to the “very constructive discussions” between him and Prime Minister Modi in Samarkand (Uzbekistan) during the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation(SCO) summit a week earlier.\n\nThey talked about the areas that interest both India and Turkey in terms of what they do bilaterally, in terms of how they can converge regionally, and also in terms of how their perspectives can meet more strongly with regard to developments all over the world.\n\nThree Reasons Why Ankara Is Resetting Its Ties With India\n\nOne, India has assumed the Chairmanship of the SCO, arguably based on the European Union model, for the year. And India will assume the Presidency of the highly influential G- 20 (big economies of the world) this December.\n\nTurkey, which is undergoing a big economic crisis with historically high inflation of 80 percent, has to be pragmatic, not ideological, so as to win more friends than foes.\n\nErdogan has said that Turkey wants to become a member of the SCO (now it is only a dialogue partner) and that he would pursue the idea at the SCO’s 2023 meeting in India.\n\nObviously, an anti-India posture will not help the matter for Turkey in the changed circumstances, particularly when despite the hitherto tense relations between them, India-Turkey bilateral trade has been fairly extensive. Trade is touching close to about $10 billion.\n\nIndia has awarded a consortium of Turkey’s top five leading shipyards, TAIS, the contract of naval shipbuilding worth $2.3 billion. A Turkish company, Savronik, has also completed a defense ministry-related project to build a tunnel in India’s Leh-Manali highway.\n\nIndians are now the third-largest Asian tourists in Turkey after China and Indonesia. Indian businesses, from food to technology, have been gradually expanding their presence in Turkey.\n\nTwo, Turkey perhaps realizes now its failure to emerge as the leader of the “Islamic grouping,” consisting of Pakistan, Malaysia, Iran, and Qatar, in an attempt to break Saudi Arabia and the UAE’s ideological supremacy within the Islamic world.\n\nFormer Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan was Erdogan’s biggest supporter. His ouster from office, followed by Pakistan’s acute financial dependence on Saudi Arabia, has virtually killed that idea.\n\nOn the other hand, a “pragmatic” Turkey is now normalizing relations with countries like Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. In February, Erdogan visited the UAE to bring relations back on track after diversions over Libya and the economic blockade against Qatar orchestrated by the UAE and Saudi Arabia.\n\nMost recently, Turkey re-established diplomatic relations with Israel after more than a decade of tensions that erupted in 2010 when Israeli commandos killed 10 Turkish activists aboard a Turkish aid vessel, the Mavi Marmara, attempting to break the Israeli maritime blockade of Gaza.\n\nThey have decided to appoint their respective ambassadors for the first time in four years. The two countries expelled each other’s ambassadors in 2018 over the killing of scores of protesters in Gaza by Israeli soldiers on the anniversary of the creation of the Israeli state. Turkey’s President had otherwise long criticized Israel’s treatment of Palestinians.\n\nAnd most importantly, in June, Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman traveled to Turkey to normalize ties after a Turkish court agreed to transfer the case relating to the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018 to Riyadh, removing a significant obstacle between the two countries.\n\nAfter the UAE, Saudi Arabia has now pledged to Turkey billions of dollars that will boost the Turkish economy ahead of an election next year. Erdogan has also reached out to other foes, including Egypt and Armenia, to mend relations.\n\nIncidentally, India now has excellent relations with all these countries – the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Israel, and Egypt. Turkey seems to have taken note of it while rebuilding ties with India.\n\nThree, it is becoming increasingly obvious that Turkey is getting disenchanted with Pakistan by and by, the most important factor behind its animosity towards India. The number of illegal Pakistani.\n\nThe number of illegal Pakistani immigrants in Turkey is proving to be a huge irritant in Ankara’s ties with Islamabad.\n\nAccording to Turkish authorities, there are between 3,000 and 6,000 illegal Pakistani nationals in detention at any given time, while many others stay in Turkey until they will find a way to go to Europe.\n\nBut what is disturbing the Turkish authorities is that the Pakistani immigrants are not respecting the country’s culture, particularly the women.\n\nIn April of this year, a Pakistani immigrant was caught sharing photographs and videos of Turkish women recorded on social media. Similar videos by other Pakistani immigrants also surfaced on social media, creating a furor in the Turkish population. “Pakistan Get Out” is, therefore, a big trend in Turkish social media.\n\nIntelligence reports claim that illegal Pakistan immigrants have also been found indulging in gang wars and other illegal crimes, including human and narco-trafficking and ransom kidnapping of tourists visiting Turkey.\n\nThis is a major challenge as Turkey is a favorite destination, and tourism is an important revenue-generating source for the economy. A recent incident (late April) was the kidnapping of a small group of Nepali tourists in Istanbul. Luckily, they were rescued by the Police, and six Pakistanis who had committed the crime and asked for a ransom of 10.000 Euros were arrested.\n\nConsidering all this, experts say that past setbacks notwithstanding, India-Turkey ties have a real chance of better days ahead.\n\nKabir Taneja, a Fellow at the Strategic Studies Programme of the Delhi-based think- tank Observer Research Foundation, seems to make sense when he says, “Using mechanisms such as the I2U2 grouping between India, the UAE, Israel, and the US, aimed toward regional economic dialogues as a springboard could provide new ideations and opportunities for dialogue with Ankara relating to trade and other economic opportunities via the Gulf, offering potentially small steps to test ground and intent prior to having more consequential dialogues addressing the more fundamental challenges that persist”.",
    "Why does Crete ruin Turkey's plans in the East Mediterranean?": "After the outrageous and slanderous speech at the UN by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, it is clear that that the country is entering a whole new environment of confrontation with Greece.\n\nNo one can now predict the next moves of the Turkish president and whether this will lead to a \"hot episode\". For now, the new fact is that the Turks are escalating the provocations and the ever-increasing drone flights over Greek islands and islets.\n\nThe presence of the much-advertised Bayraktar TB2 worries many, although the Israeli Drone Dome system that Greece already has drastically reduces their capabilities, \"blinding\" their electronic systems.\n\nBut in the long run, Greece's main weapon against the possibility of a conflict is Crete. The island which many times in history has emerged as a stronghold of Greece is once again, it seems, to be the strategic element that scares the Turks.\n\nGreece's announcement that Crete will house the F-35s when they arrive, as well as the new F-16 Vipers, along with the large UAVs we will be buying and producing, has greatly alarmed the Turks.\n\nThe reason is simple: The Turks have directed their attention and the general arrangement of their air defense towards the Aegean islands. The reinforcement of Crete as the main base of the Greek air force forces the Turks to change the arrangement of their air defence and to disperse it towards the South.\n\nThe existence of stealth F-35s and Vipers in Crete and their ability to operate not from the front of the islands but from the southern side, forces the Turks to redesign all their plans and redesign their air defence based on the new scenario.\n\nIndicative of how exposed Turkey is on this side of the Mediterranean, Greek F-16s have managed to land in Cyprus without raising alarms.\n\nTurkey's Achilles heel on this side is highlighted even more, after the decision of the Americans to stop the ban on the sale of arms to Cyprus.\n\nSo Crete, combined with the help it could receive from Cyprus, creates a completely new status in the Southeast Mediterranean, with the Turks being forced to change their plans.\n\nIn any case, the choice of Crete as a key pressure lever of Turkish aggression, combined with the upgrade of Alexandroupolis, creates enormous irritation among the Turks.\n\nWhether this irritation will lead to a heated episode or the voice of reason will prevail remains to be seen. Until then, the logic of composure and preparedness is definitely the best method against an \"ally\" completely mindless.\n\nREAD MORE: The defence of Greece begins in Armenia.",
    "Turkey working to organize Zelensky-Putin meeting – Cavusoglu": "Turkey continues to make efforts to hold a meeting between the presidents of Ukraine and Russia, believing that they can make a decision about a \"just peace.\"\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu said this in Tokyo, where he arrived for the funeral of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Ukrinform reports, citing TRT Haber.\n\n\"There must be a just peace, of course, especially for Ukraine. Because the lands occupied (by Russia) belong to Ukraine. Of course, actors who want the war to continue outside of these two countries also need to be convinced. As Turkey, we have not lost hope. We are increasing and continuing our efforts. Our goal is a meeting of both leaders and decision-making at the level of the leaders,\" Cavusoglu said.\n\nHe also said that there are no winners in the war, and as soon as both sides realize this, they can return to the negotiating table.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the head of the President's Office, earlier said that there is currently no sense in holding negotiations between Ukraine and Russia or a meeting between Volodymyr Zelensky and Vladimir Putin.\n\nAt the same time, he added, the meeting of the presidents is possible if it is preceded by the complete withdrawal of Russian troops, and the subject of the conversation will be the \"discussion of post-war life, including the scope of reparations, compensation for damages and the extradition of criminals.\"",
    "Erdogan was different at the UN this time": "In the spring of 2006, for one of my first jobs in journalism, I worked as a reporting intern for a wire service at the UN headquarters in New York. Two days a week I marched into the sleek Secretariat building looming over the East River, eager to cover the day’s most urgent issues – the Darfur crisis, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, global hunger and more.\n\nI soon discovered that diplomats were much better at their jobs than I had imagined. They would look me dead in the eye and respond to my questions with intelligence and apparent insight. Yet, once I had typed up the interview and dropped it into my article, I would realise they had simply used different words to express sentiments that had been said a hundred times before.\n\nReporting at the UN was like panning for gold: high hopes inevitably crumbled as the sifting turned up only sand. Amid the flurry of flashbulbs, it turned out, very little of substance occurred. By the time I left, I viewed the UN as little more than the world’s pre-eminent public relations platform.\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Liz Truss holds a bilateral meeting with Turkey's President Erdogan at the Turkey Mission Building in New York during the 77th UN General Assembly, on September 21. Pool photo via AP\n\nThis might explain why Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has over the years shown a knack for grabbing the world’s attention on his autumnal visits to Turtle Bay. In his first UN General Assembly speech in 2005, he declared terrorism “the enemy of humankind” and launched the Alliance of Civilisations initiative with Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Spain’s then prime minister, to unite international counter-extremism efforts.\n\nIn 2014, Mr Erdogan invoked, for the first time on the global stage, the phrase that has since become his refrain on the UN Security Council’s five permanent members. “I should emphasise that the world is bigger than five,” he said.\n\nIn 2016, he denounced Europe’s “degrading treatment” of a wave of newly arrived, mostly Arab refugees and, just weeks after a failed coup had shaken Turkey, urged the world to take measures against his government’s main suspect, the Gulen movement.\n\nIn 2019, he proposed a controversial safe zone in northern Syria and defended the rights of Palestinians. “Where are the borders of the state of Israel?” he wondered, denouncing Israeli annexations as illegitimate.\n\nQuote Absent was the fire of earlier UN speeches. He called for peace in Syria but refrained from criticising the EU and US\n\nLast year, Mr Erdogan handed out copies of his new book, urging reform at the UN and other international bodies, and inaugurated the $300 million Turkish House. He described Turkey’s new consulate and permanent UN mission – 17 metres taller than Secretariat, just across the street – as an expression of his nation’s growing influence.\n\nThis year, in contrast, Mr Erdogan seemed more subdued, seeking to highlight his country’s positive role in world affairs. Citing the need for food security in the Horn of Africa and peace talks in Ukraine, he said Turkey had endeavoured “to be part of the solution” around the world.\n\nHe’s half right, as we’re in the midst of another Tale-of-Two-Cities moment for Mr Erdogan. At home he may be less well liked than he’s been since his last days as Istanbul mayor, a quarter-century ago. And tensions with Greece, Turkey’s Aegean neighbour, have spiked in recent weeks as the two have traded insults and accusations.\n\nBut farther abroad, despite lingering tensions with the US and EU, Turkey has made real diplomatic gains, including renewed ties with Gulf powers, Israel and Egypt. In New York, Mr Erdogan held a meeting with Israeli Prime Minster Yair Lapid, marking the first time since the George W Bush presidency that an Israeli prime minister met a Turkish president.\n\nMore from David Lepeska What 'Devil Village' tells us about the future of the Ukraine war\n\nHowever troubling Mr Erdogan’s threats to “open the gates” of migration have been, it’s Turkey – not Greece, as top EU officials have asserted – that has served as Europe’s refugee shield, hosting 4-5 million foreigners for nearly a decade and keeping them out of the EU.\n\nAlso, even as Turkey has strengthened ties with Azerbaijan, potentially providing Europe with a much-needed alternative to Russian natural gas, Ankara has inched toward normalisation with historic rival Armenia and the opening of their long-closed border.\n\nLast but not least is Ukraine. Ankara’s western and Nato allies have been largely unable to criticise its continued friendly relations with Moscow because of how it has leveraged them. With more than 40 countries at risk of famine in late summer, Turkey played a crucial role in bringing Ukraine and Russia to agree on a plan to release millions of tonnes of grain from Ukrainian ports.\n\nSince March, Ankara has spearheaded efforts to bring Ukraine and Russia to the negotiating table. “There will be no losers in a fair peace process,” Mr Erdogan told the UN General Assembly, calling for support of Turkey’s diplomacy.\n\nAbsent was the fire of earlier UN speeches. He called for peace in Syria but refrained from criticising the EU and US for their unwillingness to help solve the refugee issue. He also stayed his hand on Moscow’s military mobilisation, even as reports emerged that four of five military summons in Russian-occupied Crimea have gone to Crimean Tatars – a persecuted Turkic-Muslim minority Mr Erdogan regularly defends.\n\nHis most notable activity in New York was an afternoon stroll in Central Park. He met a local rabbi, sat for photos with parents and their children, and from one passerby, received a hearty \"thank you\" on Ukraine, for the drones, the grain deal and “helping to make Nato stronger”.\n\nThe President’s communications team released a seven-minute video of the park visit, which some critics said had been staged. This is understandable; in Turkey, Mr Erdogan does not stroll through parks or chat with everyday citizens. But it all seemed real enough.\n\nErdogan receives expressions of deep gratitude from a passerby in Central Park, in an impromptu exchange that does not look staged at all. https://t.co/EJBoBs0LFP — Paul T. Levin (@PaulTLevin) September 19, 2022\n\nTurkey’s lira hit yet another record low last week, at 18.42 to the dollar, and the governing AKP has been trailing in polls for months. With elections looming next year, the Central Park video was probably an attempt to humanise Mr Erdogan, to present a warmer leader who is also comfortable in the world.\n\nMaybe after years of relishing his moment in the spotlight, Mr Erdogan has come to share my view that the UN is mostly sound and fury. Perhaps he decided to take a break and enjoy his time in the Big Apple, walk in the park, revel in recent successes, speak in the third person.\n\nA Turkish reporter at the UN asked if he hoped to meet US President Joe Biden and he shook his head. “He is Biden,” Turkey’s leader responded with a grin. “I’m Erdogan.”",

ArrowRight Lapid’s office said that Tuesday’s meeting in New York was the first face-to-face encounter between leaders of the two countries since 2008 and that they discussed “economic and energy cooperation.”\n\nA month ago, Israel and Turkey announced a full restoration of diplomatic ties and exchange of ambassadors, a development that Lapid described as “an important asset for regional stability and very important economic news for the citizens of Israel.”\n\nTurkey, the first Muslim country to recognize Israel as a state and, before 2008, one of its strongest allies in the region, has over the past decade and a half intensely challenged Israel over its treatment of Palestinians. Erdogan has repeatedly made parallels between his own democratically elected Islamist party and Hamas, which rules the blockaded Gaza Strip, calling it “a resistance movement that defends the Palestinian homeland against an occupying power.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTurkey’s increasing criticism of Israeli treatment of Palestinians caused diplomatic tumult. In 2010, Ankara recalled its ambassador after an Israeli naval commando raid on a Gaza-bound aid flotilla resulted in the deaths of 10 Turkish activists. Tensions again boiled over in 2018, following bloody protests on the Gaza border provoked by President Donald Trump’s decision to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, and Turkey and Israel recalled their respective ambassadors.\n\nBut the tide has turned in recent months, as Israel, exploiting its recently discovered offshore natural gas sites, seeks to export billions of cubic meters to a European market seeking to wean itself from Russian supplies.\n\nIsraeli gas is part of a global, patchwork energy strategy being forged by European leaders looking ahead to a potentially difficult winter. Russia’s pipeline gas today makes up 9 percent of all imported gas to the European Union, compared with 40 percent before Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs part of this effort, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen signed a deal with Israeli and Egyptian leaders in June that will enable Israel to pipe natural gas to Europe via Egyptian liquefaction facilities.\n\nAs a result of the diplomatic strain, Ankara abandoned talks years ago to build an underwater natural gas pipeline linking Israel to Europe via Turkey.\n\nBut Erdogan called a visit to Turkey in March by Israeli President Isaac Herzog, the first in over a decade, “an opportunity to revive the cooperation on the topic of energy that began before.”\n\nAt his speech before the General Assembly on Tuesday, Erdogan highlighted energy as a priority in Turkey’s foreign policy.\n\n“Turkey has always looked at energy as a field of cooperation rather than competition,” he said. “In addition to our own needs, we have implemented many projects that support regional and global energy security.”\n\nZeynep Karatas in Istanbul contributed to this report.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",
    "Women in Turkey Protest Iranian Woman's Death": "A group of Iranians living in Istanbul and Turkish citizens gathered Wednesday in front of the Iranian Consulate in Istanbul to protest the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody in Tehran.\n\nIstanbul police, who on Tuesday repeatedly dispersed groups that gathered in Taksim Square, watched the action from afar.\n\nDuring the demonstration, at least three women cut their hair to protest the treatment of Amini, who was detained by Iran's morality police because she didn't wear her headscarf correctly and therefore her hair was showing. She later died while in custody.\n\nProtesters shouted slogans in Persian, Turkish and Kurdish. The Turkish chants included, \"We do not keep silent, we do not fear, we do not obey,\" and \"My body, my decision.\"\n\nThe Persian and Kurdish slogans included, \"Women live freely\" and \"We do not want a mullah regime.\"\n\nBanners carried by the group of about 300 people included harsh criticism against Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei and the Iranian regime.\n\nMahdi Sağlar, one of the Iranians who participated in the protest, has been living and working in Turkey for 20 years.\n\n\"They beat a girl to death because her hair was showing,\" Sağlar told VOA Turkish. \"Their own children dress as they want in Europe and America, they behave as they want, but in Iran, they arrested her because her hair is out, and they killed her by causing a brain hemorrhage with a blow to the brain at the police station. We are here to protest this. Our citizens in Iran are protesting here on the street as well.''\n\nGelare Abdi, another Iranian protester, said that although she loves her homeland very much, she can't live in her country due to heavy pressure.\n\n\"I need freedom,\" she said. \"But I have no freedom in Iran. I have been here in Turkey for two years out of necessity. … They killed Mahsa because her hair was showing a small forelock. She was just 22 years old. I am also a woman and I want freedom.''\n\nThis story originated with VOA's Turkish Service.",
    "Russian men are flying to Turkey to avoid military service in Ukraine": "Russian men are flying to Turkey to avoid military service in Ukraine\n\nRussia's call-up of additional troops has prompted many men to look for ways to avoid military service. Some of them are packing flights to Turkey.\n\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\n\nThere are long car lines at Russian border crossings. Airplane flights out of the country are sold out or skyrocketing in price. This is after the Kremlin announced this week that Russia will be partially mobilizing hundreds of thousands of reservists to bolster their forces in Ukraine. NPR's Fatma Tanis is in Istanbul, where flights from Russia have been arriving with men trying to avoid military service. She spoke with some of them and joins us now.\n\nFatma, thanks so much for being with us.\n\nFATMA TANIS, BYLINE: Thank you, Scott.\n\nSIMON: You were at Istanbul's main airport yesterday, and what was the scene like?\n\nTANIS: Right. So first, I should note that Turkey is one of few countries that doesn't require a visa for Russians. Since they can't go to European Union countries or the U.S. easily, lots of Russians have been coming here. There are multiple flights every day from Russian cities to Istanbul and other places in Turkey. And nearly all of them have been booked solid for the next few weeks. Tickets were sold for upwards of $3,000, even.\n\nAt the airport, I found Russians coming in the arrivals terminal. Most of them were men, and many didn't want to talk because they're afraid of Russian government tracking them. One of them actually asked if I had a secret camera around as I was trying to interview him. But one thing really stood out. Most of the men had very little luggage, and that's because they had to convince Russian authorities that they were just leaving the country for a short trip, not to evade conscription.\n\nSIMON: So they have to act like they're not leaving to avoid the war. Were you able to speak with some of these men, and what did they tell you about how they got out?\n\nTANIS: Yes, they said it wasn't easy. After they heard the announcement, they rushed to find tickets, paid a lot of money, packed quickly. Then at the airports in Russia, they described crowds, long waits as men who tried to leave were being interrogated by police. And because they were concerned about government retribution, they didn't want to use their names when talking to me. But here's one 35-year-old man from Moscow describing the questioning he faced.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Police interrogated us. There was some question about, for example, when did you buy this ticket? What's the purpose? And the second line, they asked, did you service in the military? When? And did you receive the post that you need to go?\n\nTANIS: He said nearly all of the people on his flight were men between the ages of 20 to 50, and he knows many more back in Russia who are desperately trying to leave, but it's very hard to find tickets now.\n\nSIMON: Fatma, did you get a sense of how they felt about the war, not just their own welfare, but the war generally?\n\nTANIS: I did. So the ones I spoke with said they were anti-war, and they believed that a full-on draft is coming soon. But they said that not only can you get in trouble for saying that publicly, it's caused divisions between friends and relatives. And people have been arrested for protesting the mobilization in Russia. There are even reports that they're getting drafted while in police custody to be sent in Ukraine. One man told me that for Russians who are anti-war today, there are only two choices - to leave the country or go to jail.\n\nSIMON: What do they plan to do now that they're out of Russia?\n\nTANIS: They have limited options. You know, they moved quickly to leave and were limited to taking out just $10,000 in cash. It's difficult to use the Russian payment system abroad because of sanctions. But while in Turkey, most said they'll try to get a residence permit, look for apartments and jobs so they can bring their families out of Russia, too. Some of them already have friends here. There's a Russian anti-war community already here that can help. They've been coming in large numbers since the invasion began in the spring.\n\nSIMON: NPR's Fatma Tanis in Istanbul. Thanks so much.\n\nTANIS: Thank you, Scott.\n\nCopyright © 2022 NPR. All rights reserved.

    "Bangladesh business delegation to explore trade, investment opportunities in Turkey": "An 86-member business delegation from Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DCCI) will leave for Istanbul, Türkiye on Tuesday on a four-day visit.\n\nDCCI President Rizwan Rahman will be leading the business delegation.\n\nThe purpose of the visit will be to explore a new scope of business and investment cooperation especially in the diverse manufacturing, general trading and service sectors with a view to identify potential business partners for joint venture investment, attract FDI from Turkey to Bangladesh and vice versa.\n\nBangladesh and Turkey have been maintaining a friendly diplomatic and economic relation since ages, said the chamber body on Monday ahead of the visit.\n\nThe long standing bilateral relations between Bangladesh and Turkey reached a “new height” with increasing trade and investment cooperation in diverse areas.\n\nTo steer this friendly economic relation, the DCCI is leading the business delegation to Istanbul, Turkey.\n\nDuring this business trip, the delegation will have several interactive business meetings with one of the largest Chambers in the world, the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce, the Foreign Economic Relations Board of Turkey (DEIK).\n\nMoreover, there will be Turkey-Bangladesh Business Forum, business to business (B2B) match-makings, industry visits and meetings with the Turkish Trade Minister Mehmet MUS.

    "Turkey singing the same old song": "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan speaks with Russia’s Vladimir Putin (not pictured) on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, on Friday. [EPA]\n\nIn a letter dated June 5, 1963 and addressed to the elderly Turkish prime minister Ismet Inonu, US President Lyndon Johnson sought to avert a military invasion of Cyprus by threatening that in the case of a Soviet attack, the United States and NATO would not come to Ankara’s aid.\n\nThe letter worked, much to the satisfaction of Nicosia and Athens. The Turkish Cypriots, however, were deeply chagrined as they had been looking forward to Turkey’s intervention following bloody clashes between the two communities.\n\nIn order to further demoralize the Turkish Cypriots, Cyprus’ RIK radio station aired a seemingly innocuous ballad titled “I Waited but You Never Came.” The Turkish side responded with another song that was repeatedly played on Bayrak Radio, titled “I May Come Suddenly One Night.” A decade later, the Turks invaded Cyprus.\n\nIt is the refrain of this same song that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeats every so often in his speeches. Doing so is not just some neo-Ottoman syndrome, but a deliberate and constant reminder that Turkey does what it says. Unless every issue between the two countries is put on the table of talks on the basis of international law and other international and bilateral agreements, according to each’s interpretation. This is Ankara’s fixed position, though not Athens’.\n\nHowever, in contrast to the 1960s, when the world was split between two sides and Greece and Turkey were entirely dependent on the US, the present international environment is showing alarming signs of destabilization.\n\nWashington retains a significant foothold in Europe, but it is being tested by the negative consequences of the sanctions imposed as a punishment on Russia and which are also testing the European Union sorely too. In the meantime, rapprochements are being made that are completely out of the Americans’ control, most notably with regard to strengthening cooperation between Moscow and Beijing.\n\nLast Thursday, Erdogan traveled to Uzbekistan to take part in a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), where he held a string of meetings with foreign leaders. This coming Friday, the Turkish president will travel to New York for the United Nations General Assembly. We do not know whether he will meet with his American counterpart, Joe Biden, but the issue of the supply of F-16 fighter jets and modernization kits is bound to be discussed at some level.\n\nThere are some who are naively putting a lot of stock into a potential rift between Ankara and Washington. They fail to understand that this would be the worst possible scenario for Greece’s security.\n\nThe Greek government and the entirety of the country’s opposition are all in a tizzy over a great number of things, but when it comes to the enormous problem of Greek-Turkish relations they all claim to be feeling “calm.” Perhaps with the hope that Erdogan will not just sing the same old song.",
    "Ombudsman reveals conditions of stay of Azov Regiment commanders in Turkey": "The Azov Regiment commanders, freed during Ukraine–Russia prisoner exchange last week, now stay in good conditions in Turkey.\n\n\"They are in good conditions there, under the personal, let's say, guarantee of the President of Turkey. All the conditions for a safe normal life were created for them, as far as possible. And the only condition that was put forward to them as part of the prisoner exchange is a restriction and ban on returning to Ukraine while the war against the Russian Federation continues in our country,\" Dmytro Lubinets, Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights, said during the nationwide telethon, an Ukrinform correspondent reports.\n\nAccording to him, this condition made their release possible through the mediation of the President of Turkey and the personal assistance of the President of Ukraine.\n\nLubinets added that he was not aware of any restrictions on the movement of freed commanders. In particular, in Turkey they meet, including, with representatives of Ukraine.\n\nWhen asked whether the five Azov Regiment commanders will be able to talk with Ukrainian journalists, the Ombudsman expressed the opinion that this would happen but did not outline the terms.\n\nThe Commissioner also emphasized that the authorities had the task to return absolutely all captives, and public comments on certain processes in this area can sometimes hinder the next steps. He underscored that the work on the return of Ukrainian citizens from Russian captivity was ongoing.\n\n\"We are constantly working towards the release of both prisoners of war and civilian captives. Our goal is to liberate absolutely everyone. This process does not stop, it is permanent. Even when we already have an exchange, we agree on the next steps,\" he said, adding that \"some nuances we cannot and will not say publicly.\"\n\nAt the same time, Lubinets noted that no groups of prisoners were prioritized. The authorities work towards the return of service members from Snake Island, the National Guard members captured in the Chornobyl zone, and other Ukrainian defenders.\n\nThe relevant officials also deal with the release of civilian captives, some of whom were sentenced to 15, 17, 19 years in prison in the Russian Federation.\n\nAs reported, more than 200 Ukrainian defenders, as well as 10 foreigners who fought on the side of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, returned from Russian captivity within the prisoner swap on September 21.\n\nThe five freed Azov Regiment commanders will stay in Turkey until the end of the full-scale war under the personal security guarantees of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.\n\nol",
    "Erdoğan claims he is trying to revive the Greek population in Turkey: \"Mitsotakis and Dendias live in their own world\"": "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is unrepentant to the decline of the Greek minority in Turkey and attempted to respond to Athens' data shortly after being humiliated at the United Nations General Assembly.\n\nEuropean Union Special Representative for Human Rights Eamon Gilmore said at the 77th United Nations General Assembly in New York on Wednesday that Turkey should protect the human rights and property rights of its Greek minority.\n\nReferring specifically to Turkey, Gilmore said, “The EU deeply regrets past discriminatory policies implemented by Turkey, which resulted in the Greek Minority currently being on the verge of extinction.\n\n“In this context, the EU reiterates the call on Turkey to protect human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, including property rights of persons belonging to minorities and minorities’ legal entities.”\n\nGilmore was speaking on the Assembly’s 30th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities.\n\nThe declaration “remains a milestone for the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to minorities referred to above,” he said\n\nFor his part, Erdoğan told reporters on the presidential plane upon his return from New York.: \"I can't say much about the Greek foreign minister, he is not my counterpart... If he is going to speak, let him see Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu and talk with him. But the prime minister [Kyriakos Mitsotakis], unfortunately, he does not know his own situation with Turkey. We have not been the government that wants the reduction of the Greek population in Turkey.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, when I had traveled to Tenedos and Imbros, for example, I always asked the few Greeks who lived there, 'Where are your children? In America,' they told me. I told them, 'Bring them to live here. 'I can't bring my child from America,' they told me.\n\n\"What does this show? It means that they have no desire or effort to live in Turkey. If nothing else, our door is open. We would give citizenship to this child, if he had no citizenship. But of course the Greek foreign minister knows nothing of all this. They live in their own world.\"\n\nIn fact, he repeated, as SKAI correspondent Manolis Kostidis reports, that he decided to mediate for the marriage of a Greek man with Turkish woman.\n\n“Actually, it made a lot of sense that once, a (Greek) family did not allow someone to marry a Turkish woman. I said, 'If you ask me for help, I'll try.' There is also that.\"\n\nAlso, the president of Turkey spoke of a \"positive climate\", however, unlike Kyriakos Mitsotakis, he did not see Joe Biden at the reception hosted by the American president in honor of the leaders participating in the high-level week of the 77th UN General Assembly.\n\n\"We are currently interested in buying F-16s. We had positive discussions with Mr. Biden on this issue. I've also had some meetings with Republican senators here. Our Minister Hulusi Akar is also having talks with his counterpart. We are moving towards a positive climate. We hope that this positive atmosphere will continue. I believe that we will have a result from this work as soon as possible,\" he noted.\n\n“Of course,” said the Turkish president, “we did not have the opportunity to meet with Mr. Biden at the reception. Later, we may have an opportunity to discuss these matters with telephone diplomacy. But we will monitor the process with the meetings of the Minister of National Defence and our Minister of Foreign Affairs. Developments are moving in a positive direction from now on.\"\n\nAt the same time, the president of Turkey said, referring to the Muslim minority: \"The Synod of the Patriarchate must have a certain number of members. Their number had been reduced to seven. Because it did not have a specific number, as I told Patriarch Bartholomew: 'Bring the priests from abroad, I will give them citizenship, because they must be citizens of the Republic of Turkey, so you have completed the Synod.' They ended it like that. But of course the Greek foreign minister knows nothing of all this. They're flying into space!\"\n\n\"Our door is always open (for Greeks), we also give citizenship. During our time we did not expel any Greeks from our country. However, there is no limit to the persecutions they are currently perpetrating against our citizens and compatriots in Western Thrace. Recently, in fact, they want to appoint our own priests (muftis) there themselves. What can you understand from the state and structure of our clergy? Have we made such an effort? Did we stand up and appoint the priests here etc? No\", he commented, forgetting that the appointment of muftis by the Greek state is provided for in the Treaty of Lausanne and that Turkey itself appoints their own Imams.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nikos Dendias, in his statements from New York after Erdoğan's delirium from the floor of the UN General Assembly, had referred with specific data to the issue of the Greek minority in Istanbul compared to the Muslim minority in Greece.\n\n\"In principle, Greece is a European country, which absolutely respects human rights and of course the rights of the Muslim minority. After all, the numbers prove it. The Muslim minority in Greece is growing, expanding and prospering. It would be good for Turkey to answer what happened to the Greek minority in Istanbul and how the once thriving minority of over 100,000 has today been reduced to less than 5,000 people\", the Greek Foreign Minister said.\n\nGreek minority in Turkey victim of the 1955 pogrom\n\nUntil 1955 there were about one hundred thousand Greeks living in Constantinople (Istanbul). Now they are less than two thousand.\n\nIn September of 1955, the large Greek population became victim to a heinous pogrom that resulted in the suffering and death of many and the destruction of countless homes and businesses.\n\nMen and women were raped, and according to the testimony of the famous Turkish writer Aziz Nesin, many priests were forced to be circumcised, with one of the victims being an Armenian priest.\n\nThe Pogrom against Hellenism in Istanbul resulted in the death of sixteen Greeks and the injury of thirty-two, the death of one Armenian, the rape of twelve Greek women, and the rape of an unspecified number of men, but the real numbers could be much higher.\n\nViolence against the Greeks took place not only in Istanbul but also in Izmir, or Smyrna. On the morning of September 7th, Turkish nationalists set fire to the Greek pavilion at the Izmir International Fair.\n\nEconomic destruction and fear forced thousands of expatriates to emigrate to Greece. Of the one hundred thousand Greeks who resided in Istanbul in 1955, only two thousand remain in the city today.\n\nREAD MORE: Turkey: Opposition to Erdoğan is winning by ten points according to latest polls.",

    "Turkey turns Niger into a pawn in the larger Greco-Turkish conflict": "There is a power play going on between EU, Russia, China and the USA in Africa with Turkey recently adding more fuel to it. All these countries know that the upcoming century is going to be Africa’s. One more exhibition of power play can be witnessed in the Saharan country of Niger. Niger is playing pawn into the hands of Turkey in a very old and big game of geopolitics. But to understand this complex situation between Turkey, France, Greece we need to understand the decades old Greco-Turkish conflict.\n\nUnderstanding the conflict between Greece and Turkey\n\n“We can come suddenly one night,” said the Turkish President Reccep Tayyp Erdogan while he was attending the Teknofest, the country’s largest technology event in the northern city of Samsun.\n\n“Coming suddenly one night”, is a line from a love poem which is written by a romantic poet Umit Yasar Oguzcan which was later composed into a song by Rustu Sardag and sung by Emel Sayın. This line was assimilated into Turkish political discourse after radio commentators and writers used this line to refer to Turkey’s illegal occupation of Northern Cyprus.\n\nErdogan used this line to threaten Greece against the fortification of Greek islands which are more close to Turkey than mainland Greece. France backed Greece says it needs to secure its islands including the tourist hotspots Rhodes and Kos islands.\n\nThe tensions are increasing in the Eastern Mediterranean, with Greece warning that a conflict similar to Ukraine is possible after Turkey threatened a military action against it. A number of disagreements between Turkey and Greece date back a long time, which include airspace boundaries, natural gas, maritime rights, and the sovereignty of Aegean islands.\n\nTurkey’s agenda behind Bayraktar deal with Niger\n\nAs it can be seen, since two years the economy of Turkey has been in doldrums. Turkey is struggling from an economic crisis which is fueled by Covid-19 and further deteriorated after the West sanctioned Turkey for violations in the F-35 manufacturing programme.\n\nErdogan is seeing the possible potential of reviving the economy by its only saleable Bayraktar drones which are in news after Azerbaijan used them against Armenia in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.\n\nThe conflict between Turkey and Greece is century-old and Turkey sees Greece as a formidable enemy which is backed by France and Russia. So, to weaken the influence of Greece, Turkey is playing its own game against France in Niger by selling the Bayraktar drones in the name of fighting against terrorists groups. As per the official statement the drones will be used against terror groups backed by Islamic state and Al-Qaeda which are currently in the tri-border region between Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso, which also is a major part of the Sahel region.\n\nIn recent times Greece has started to challenge Erdogan’s might in the region, rattled by which Erdogan reiterated his veiled threat, stating that Turkey could “come all of a sudden one night,” in response to what he claimed were hostilities emerging from Greece backed by France.\n\nAt a press conference at the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, Erdogan stated, “If what I said was that we could come one night all of a sudden [it means] that, when the time comes, we can come suddenly one night.” (sic)\n\nTurkey’s Diversionary Tactics\n\nAs we can see, Turkey basically is not at ease owing to France’s support to Greece. France’s debacle in the Sahel region in Africa, the diminishing popularity of the France backed Barkhane Forces in the region has provided an opportunity to Turkey. Just a few days ago Niger saw large scale protests demanding the exit of 3000 French-Barkhane troops from Niger. These protests came in light owing to the allegations on the Barkhane forces to have sided with the Islamic jihadi extremists in the region. Taking cue from this event, Turkey is taking advantage of the same and using its diversionary tactics to keep France busy in Africa by supplying the requisite arms to Niger. It is doing this because when the time comes of a conflict or a small-scale war between Turkey and Greece, France will be busy in Africa and shall not overtly help Greece.\n\nThe clever Erdogan knows that France is currently struggling with its stagnant economy and keeping it busy in Africa will help Turkey in having a chance against Greece.\n\nAlso Read: Russia backed citizens of Niger come out in the streets to protest ‘Pro Jihadi elements’ in the government\n\nThe geopolitical game is more complicated than it looks and Niger needs to understand that it is just playing pawn in the hands of Turkey. The Bayraktar drones are a pile of junk as it is being proven in the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict. Erdogan is weaker than ever and he is just trying to fiddle with the situations to drum up support in his favour as he did in Libya and Syria."
