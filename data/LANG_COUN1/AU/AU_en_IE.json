    "Shadow minister’s border poll remarks alarm Northern Ireland’s unionists": "Northern Ireland unionists have expressed alarm after the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Kyle, said he would be prepared to call a referendum on Irish unity if certain conditions were met.\n\nKyle would set out the criteria for calling a border poll if Labour were in power, he told the BBC’s Sunday Politics show at his party’s conference.\n\n“If the circumstances emerge as set out in the Good Friday agreement, I as secretary of state, would not play games. I would call the border poll,” he said. “I am saying I am not going to be a barrier if the circumstances emerge.”\n\nUnder the 1998 agreement, a secretary of state must call a referendum if it appears likely a majority of those voting would want the region to leave the UK – but the agreement does not specify the criteria, a vagueness that the UK government and unionists have been keen to maintain.\n\nThe Irish government, Sinn Féin and the Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP) have pushed for clarity on the criteria, which would lay out the steps needed for a vote that could abolish the state of Northern Ireland and unify the island.\n\nKyle said Sinn Féin’s emergence as the biggest party in Northern Ireland and last week’s census results, which showed Catholics outnumbering Protestants, did not suffice. “We’re not even in that circumstance yet, so when we move towards the point where those circumstances set out in the Good Friday agreement start to emerge and it becomes a priority for the people of Northern Ireland, I will act,” he said.\n\nOn Monday the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) leader, Doug Beattie, criticised the comments as an “unhelpful and ill-timed” distraction from the cost of living crisis and other problems facing Northern Ireland.\n\nThe pro-union Belfast News Letter newspaper said the Labour politician had muddied the waters on a border poll and that it was essential any UK government kept wide discretion. It said: “It is unfortunate that Mr Kyle has chosen this time to give succour to those who want to shatter the UK.”\n\nThe Sinn Féin MP Chris Hazzard welcomed Kyle’s comments as recognition that the current position was “unsustainable”. “It’s having your head in the sand simply to deny the fact that constitutional change is coming, that people are talking about this, civic society and political parties and all around us,” the South Down MP said.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

    "Emerging Ireland Squad: Meet the Players": "The Emerging Ireland squad that will compete in the Toyota Challenge in Bloemfontein over the next two weeks features a host of players that have starred for Ireland at underage level and on the world stage for the Ireland Sevens. Fourteen were part of the IRFU’s National Talent Squad programme and the majority have already made a breakthrough at senior level for their Provinces.\n\nThe Capped Players\n\nMax Deegan was named Player of the Tournament after helping the Ireland U20s to the final of the 2016 U20 World Rugby Championships. He was capped by Ireland against Wales in the 2020 Six Nations Championships and despite some serious injury setbacks, has amassed 85 senior caps for Leinster.\n\nShane Daly has two caps for Ireland, making his senior debut against Georgia in the 2020 Autumn Nations Cup. A former Ireland Sevens international, he has 49 senior caps for Munster.\n\nRobert Baloucoune is another former Ireland Sevens international who has two senior international caps having made his debut against the USA in July 2021. The winger has 47 senior caps for Ulster.\n\nAhead of their departure for South Africa, the #EmergingIreland squad completed their three-day camp in Dublin with a visit to Clontarf Baths 🏊‍♂️#TeamOfUs | #IrishRugby pic.twitter.com/y2Ne3NE6tc — Irish Rugby (@IrishRugby) September 26, 2022\n\nThe Maori Crew\n\nCian Prendergast played in both games against the Maori All Blacks during the summer. He played for the Ireland U20s in 2020 and has made 32 senior appearances for Connacht.\n\nJoe McCarthy also played in both fixtures against the Maori All Blacks on the 2022 New Zealand Tour and played Ireland U20s with Prendergast in 2020. The second row has made 13 senior appearances for Leinster.\n\nThe Development Brief\n\nBoth Tom Ahern and Jamie Osborne trained with the Ireland squad as Development Players ahead of the 2021 Autumn Nations Series. Ahern was an Ireland U20 international in 2019 and 2020 missing the Grand Slam campaign through injury. He has made 21 senior appearances for Munster\n\nOsborne represented the Ireland U20s in 2021 but had already made his senior Leinster debut at that stage. He has made 20 senior appearances for Leinster.\n\nProven Provincials\n\nStewart Moore, Calvin Nash and Diarmuid Barron have all established themselves as senior Provincial players. All three represented Ireland at U20 World Rugby Championships.\n\nSince making his senior debut for Ulster in December 2019, Moore has accumulated 32 senior appearances. Nash has played 38 senior games for Munster, while Barron has 36 senior Munster caps.\n\nThe Class of 2019\n\nJohn Hodnett, Scott Penny, David McCann, Dylan Tierney-Martin, Brian Deeny, Jake Flannery, Thomas Clarkson, Michael Milne, Callum Reid and Josh Wycherley were all part of Ireland’s U20 Six Nations Grand Slam winning squad in 2019.\n\nAt Munster, Hodnett and Wycherley have made 22 and 29 senior provincial appearances respectively while Flannery made six senior appearances for Munster before making the switch to Ulster this season. McCann, who captained the U20s the following year, has made 15 senior appearances for Ulster with Reid clocking 11 appearances to date.\n\nTierney-Martin has made eight senior appearances for Connacht and scored a try against the Stormers at the weekend. Penny has made the most senior appearances for Leinster with 42 with Milne (18), Clarkson (18) and Deeny (3) also making the breakthrough at senior level for Leo Cullen’s side.\n\nThe Sevens Boys\n\nBaloucoune and Daly are not the only two players in the Emerging Ireland squad that have benefitted from exposure to the Ireland Sevens programme.\n\nAndrew Smith and Chay Mullins both won bronze medals at the recent Rugby World Cup Sevens in Cape Town while Cormac Izuchukwu won two Ireland Sevens caps before clocking nine senior appearances for Ulster.\n\nSmith also won the Energia AIL title with Clontarf earlier this year and has made two senior appearances for Leinster. Mullins has joined the Connacht Academy this season having also helped the Ireland U20s to a 2022 Six Nations Grand Slam.\n\nThe 2020 Triple Crowners\n\nThe 2020 U20 Six Nations was cut short by the Covid pandemic but after three games the Ireland U20 squad had secured wins over Scotland, Wales and England, claiming an unofficial Triple Crown. Ethan McIlroy, Jack Crowley, Tom Stewart and Ben Murphy were in that squad alongside the aforementioned Smith, McCann, Prendergast, Ahern and McCarthy.\n\nMcIlroy has made 37 senior appearances for Ulster while Stewart’s progress has been hampered by injury but he claimed an impressive try against Connacht in the first round of this season’s URC.\n\nOut-half Crowley has notched up 16 senior appearances for Munster including a start in the Champions Cup against Castres. Murphy has also made his senior debut for Leinster having gone on loan to Munster during the 2021/22 season.\n\nThe Class of 2021\n\nIn 2021, the U20 Six Nations took place in the summer months of June and July as the global pandemic continued to disrupt the rugby calender. Osborne featured strongly for the Richie Murphy’s side but so too did Nathan Doak, Cathal Forde and Sam Illo.\n\nDoak has already made a big impact at senior provincial level with Ulster clocking up 24 appearances since making his debut against Munster in December 2020. Forde has made two senior appearances for Connacht while Illo has featured three times since switching from the Leinster age grade system.\n\nInternational IQ Rugby\n\nThere are three players in the squad that have come through the Irish qualified player pathway. Mullins came via the Bristol Academy and the IRFU’s IQ programme in the UK.\n\nMichael McDonald was born in Ireland but represented Australia U20s at the 2019 U20 World Rugby Championship having emigrated down under with his family at the age of 13. He joined Ulster at the start of the current season.\n\nAntoine Frisch was born in France but qualifies for Ireland via his grandmother. He joined Munster this season from Premiership side Bristol Bears and made his Munster debut against Cardiff in the opening URC fixture of the 2022/23 season.\n\nRoman Salanoa was born in Hawaii but has qualified to play for Ireland through residency. He represented the USA at the 2016 U20 World Rugby Championship. Originally part of the Leinster development programme, Salanoa subsequently joined Munster and has made 10 senior appearances to date.\n\nNew Kid on the Block\n\nJames Culhane is yet to make his senior debut for Leinster but the powerful number eight left his mark on the 2022 U20 Six Nations. He was named Player of the Tournament as Ireland secured a memorable Grand Slam.",
    "British Prime Minister to seek negotiated solution over Northern Ireland": "British Prime Minister Liz Truss is seeking a negotiated solution with the European Union to resolve tensions over the Northern Ireland protocol, she said in an interview with CNN Sunday.\n\nThe Northern Ireland protocol was designed to maintain peace in the region following Brexit, and as a member of parliament, Truss introduced legislation to dissolve it. U.S. President Joe Biden has warned against disrupting peace in Northern Ireland, and the two leaders discussed the issue at their first in-person meeting Wednesday.\n\n\"What's important is that we protect and respect the positions of both the nationalist community in Northern Ireland as well as the unionist community in Northern Ireland,\" Truss said Sunday.\n\nTruss is also facing rising tensions from Commonwealth nations around the globe following the death of Queen Elizabeth II, which has reignited debates over whether the nations should sever ties with the British monarchy.\n\nTruss said she has seen an \"outpouring of love and affection\" for the late Queen, and she is very supportive of the Commonwealth.\n\n\"I think the Commonwealth is a force for good,\" she said. \"It's a believer in freedom and democracy, and we need more of that in a world where we are facing these authoritarian regimes who want to subvert those ideas.\"",
    "Killing Leprechauns: Irish satirist mines British ignorance in comedy podcast": "When Oliver Cromwell’s forces sacked the Irish town of Drogheda in 1649 and massacred its inhabitants the comedy potential seemed limited. Thousands perished and that was just the start of a military campaign that wiped out much of Ireland’s population before Cromwell returned to England.\n\nFour centuries later, however, those dark events and other landmarks of Irish history have been mined for humour – and the joke is on the British.\n\nOliver Callan, an Irish satirist, has questioned British comedians about their knowledge of Ireland and uncovered an apparently deep well of ignorance. For Killing Leprechauns, a six-part BBC podcast that launches on Saturday, Callan asked a dozen young comics about Irish stereotypes, history and current affairs. The general response: obliviousness.\n\nIt validated the old joke about the Irish never forgetting their history and the British never remembering theirs, Callan said in an interview. “It was much worse than I expected.”\n\nThe comedians appeared unaware that Britain’s closest neighbour had a young population and tech-driven economy, he said. “Their view is it’s still an old place, mass-going, the Catholic church still has a grip, we’re still backward; it’s a misty, old-fashioned country that’s taken to the drink.”\n\nComedians tend to consume a lot of media and to focus on what audiences find familiar, said Callan. “So if British comedians don’t know about Ireland and aren’t talking about Irishness, it’s indicative that their audiences don’t either and this is because their media and their establishment are not paying attention.”\n\nOliver Callan, centre, with Josh Jones and Sophie Duker who take part in the podcast.\n\nIn the series Callan pokes fun at the Irish, suggesting they were created when a red-haired rabbit copulated with a long streak of misery that floated through upper Cavan. But after prodding his guests to recount Irish tropes, such as drunkenness, he responded with facts and statistics that challenged the stereotypes.\n\nThe comedians, who include Rhys James, Glenn Moore, Ana Magliano, Josh Weller and Sophie Duker, submitted themselves to tests on their “Mick ignorance”, regarding Irish culture, and a segment called “Great Britain or hate Britain” that asked them how aspects of Britishness are regarded in Ireland.\n\nFew were aware of Cromwell’s record in Ireland, though James recalled learning in school the Puritan leader had invaded and irked the natives with “cosmic ways”. Told about massacres and that Drogheda’s governor was beaten to death with his wooden leg, James replied, tongue in cheek: “Now you’ve told me I’m furious about it, mate. If you’re listening in Ireland, I’m livid about it.”\n\nKnowledge about the Great Famine was scant but Callan said the Irish extracted a revenge of sort when the resulting emigrant tide to Britain produced an infamous descendent, Piers Morgan. “So things have a way of evening out.”\n\nThe British comedians were fuzzy about Éamon de Valera, who dominated Irish politics for much of the 20th century, but noted his name’s resemblance to “devil” and Cruella de Vil.\n\nQuestions about Ireland’s taoiseach, Micheál Martin, and his predecessor Leo Varadkar, Ireland’s first openly gay and mixed-race leader, drew a blank. The comedians were surprised to learn Joe Biden, John F Kennedy and other US presidents celebrated their Irish roots, and that Ireland had become a liberal, secular state.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Irish people followed British TV, British sport, British politics, but Britons showed little awareness or interest in Ireland. “Our intense focus on British matters is not even reciprocated at a micro level.”\n\nBritons had little reason to share navel-gazing Irish obsessions such as Biden’s Irish heritage but it was a shame they did not follow the example of King Charles, his late mother and other members of the royal family who have visited and engaged with Ireland, said Callan.\n\nThe satirist said Irish people had their own blinkers, such as ignorance about Northern Ireland and aspects of Britain, especially its geography. “We couldn’t place many cities on a map.” Brexit gave the Irish licence to create their own stereotypes, he said. “We milked it quite a bit to portray Britain as narrow-minded.” Even so, the Irish yearned for attention. “We just want the Brits to notice us.”",
    "Ireland: Rights experts call for redress for 50 years of systemic racism in childcare institutions": "Citing information received, 10 experts issued a joint statement saying that systemic racism in childcare institutions between the 1940s and 1990s, has “resulted in the higher institutionalization rate of children of African and Irish descent”.\n\nDuring their prolonged time there, children were exposed to heightened risk of corporal punishment, sexual, physical and verbal abuse, with lifelong consequences, including infringing their right to enjoy the highest standard of physical and mental health.

    "Conor McMenamin: Northern Ireland winger cleared over historical video in which he appeared to sing a pro-IRA slogan": "Conor McMenamin has been cleared to play in Northern Ireland's Nations League match against Greece on Tuesday as he will face no further action regarding a historical video in which he appeared to sing a pro-IRA slogan.\n\nThe 27-year-old Glentoran winger was withdrawn from Ian Baraclough's squad shortly before Saturday's 2-1 win over Kosovo after the video emerged.\n\nHowever, given that the footage is believed to be almost a decade old and the former Cliftonville and Linfield player was punished by his club at the time, the Irish FA allowed him to travel to Athens on Sunday while an independent disciplinary committee considered whether he had breached IFA rules.\n\nMcMenamin has now been cleared and joined his team-mates in training on Monday evening ahead of the crunch fixture against Greece, in which Northern Ireland need to avoid defeat to be sure of not dropping into a relegation play-off.\n\nMcMenamin was withdrawn a day after striker Kyle Lafferty was sent home amid an investigation by his club Kilmarnock into a video appearing to show him using alleged sectarian language, but that was understood to have been recorded only last week.\n\nImage: McMenamin (right) has played three times for Northern Ireland\n\nMcMenamin's reinstatement for the Greece game will give him the opportunity to add to the three caps he earned in June after an outstanding season with Glentoran last term was rewarded with his first international call-up.\n\nSpeaking after Saturday's 2-1 win over Kosovo, Northern Ireland manager Baraclough had said he hoped historic videos would not become a recurring problem for the team.\n\n\"It's a distraction you'd rather not have,\" Baraclough said. \"To happen so close to kick-off time, I thought we did the right things in pulling Conor out of the squad. It needs to be looked at.\n\n\"Clearly it's a historic video from social media from when he was 16 I think. I'm not sure where it's going to go at this time.\n\n\"You just hope that it isn't (something that continues) and things don't get churned up. I'd rather leave it at that and not elaborate on it too much. I was trying to concentrate on a game of football and that's what we did.\n\n\"It's been tough for the boys because if you lose two members of the squad, you know they get close and they don't like to see that happen to anyone. It could have played a major factor but they rallied and got a result.\"\n\nAhead of Tuesday's match against Greece, Baraclough said on Monday it had been the right decision to keep McMenamin out of the Kosovo game, but that he was delighted to have him available again.\n\n\"I don't think we could take any chances as an association in light of what had happened a couple of days previously with Kyle (Lafferty),\" he said. \"The decision was taken, we see where it went, the disciplinary committee looked at that and now he is free to be with us tomorrow night which is good news.\n\n\"We couldn't be sure until we looked into it and that's what's been done. I think that was right. It was hard telling the lad, hard to give him the information and to deny him being with the squad and possibly making another cap but it was the right thing to be done.\"\n\nImage: Kyle Lafferty was sent home from Northern Ireland duty amid an investigation by his club Kilmarnock into a video appearing to show him using alleged sectarian language\n\nLafferty was sent home from the squad on Friday after a video emerged of him appearing to use an alleged sectarian slur in an altercation with fans, sparking an investigation from his club Kilmarnock. The 35-year-old remains absent with that investigation ongoing.\n\nBaraclough confirmed the incident was believed to have happened after he had taken the players out for dinner last Tuesday evening as part of a team-bonding exercise, but said he had no regrets about doing so.\n\n\"We all went out, we all went to the restaurant and we all came back,\" he said. \"The players had a day off the next day, they're adults and they know they've got a responsibility. When they're away on international duty they're representing themselves, their clubs, their families and me.\n\n\"We can't keep them cooped up in a hotel, we've got to give them a certain amount of trust and hope that's the right thing to do.\n\n\"It might be something we have to look at but it's always served Northern Ireland teams well when we've had that time together. It was something we weren't expecting, to wake up to those sorts of headlines and that sort of news. It was disappointing.\"",

    "Scotland 2-1 Republic of Ireland: Nations League — as it happened": "2d ago 17.23 Steve Clarke’s turn. “It was always going to be difficult. Ireland had a free week and plenty of time to prepare, they were always going to be physically strong. You could see that in the first half when they pressed very well and stopped us getting into a rhythm. At the start of the second half we got a right grip on the game. I’m delighted for the players and really proud of them. The players are desperate to do well for their country and they showed that tonight. We go to Krakow to play a very good Ukraine team. But they have to win, and they have to approach the game in a very different manner. We’ll go away, rest, recover, count the bodies, then get on the plane to go to Poland.” Some more good news for Scotland: Clarke also reports that both Kieran Tierney and Aaron Hickey are “OK” and were taken off as a precaution.\n\n\n\n2d ago 17.18 A downcast Stephen Kenny talks to Premier Sports. “We’re very disappointed. We played very well in the first half. Some really controlled performance. Terrific. Some really good play. Scotland have a lot of really good players, there’s no doubt. We’re disappointed to concede five minutes into the second half, because we’d started the half well and that gave Scotland momentum. The crowd were up. But having said that, we responded well to that, and should have taken the lead, we’re kicking ourselves that we didn’t. The hand ball for the penalty: it seems that Alan Browne was pushed himself by a Scottish player so that seems to me contentious. Overall I thought we were exceptional in the first half. In the second Scotland came stronger and we couldn’t get the control. But the players were brilliant overall, and it was a kick in the teeth to lose, but we have to accept it. We’ve only had three defeats in 16 games, we’ve brought a lot of players through and you’ve seen how they’re developing. It’s a good combination of youth and experience, and I feel we’re getting better.”\n\n\n\n2d ago 17.02 John Egan speaks to Premier Sports. “We’re very disappointed. I think we were brilliant in the first half, took the lead. We didn’t weather the storm early on, they get a goal in the second half, but we responded well. I haven’t seen the penalty back but it’s a tough one to take. We had our chances. We feel we could have won and it’s disappointing not to get anything for it. Our front two were causing carnage up front. We put ourselves in a good position, but we should have been able to start the second half well and not give a cheap goal away. We have some fantastic young players, a good mix of youth and experience, and when we play well, it’s there to see the exciting football we want to play.”\n\n\n\n2d ago 16.51 Ryan Christie talks to Premier Sports. “It’s a big win. We came into the game desperate to win for a number of reasons. We wanted to come away from this camp with three wins, and we started on Wednesday with one. The bigger factor was what happened in Dublin in the summer, and we wanted to put that right, because we felt we let ourselves and the fans down over there. Thankfully we put that right. It was a disappointing summer but that’s why we wanted to flip that on its head. We made a few tweaks at half time and showed a bit of character. Lots of confidence to take into Tuesday.”\n\n\n\n2d ago 16.42 A post-whistle booking for Hendry, who had gone nose to nose with Coleman. It all calms down quickly enough. Hampden celebrates wildly, Scotland having put in a much-improved performance in the second half to claim all three points. Promotion to tier A and a guaranteed spot in the Euro 2024 play-offs is now within their reach, though avoiding defeat in Ukraine is no mean task. The only downside to their evening: injuries to Tierney and Hickey, and a yellow card for McTominay that rules him out of the big game on Tuesday. Disappointment meanwhile for Ireland, who contributed plenty and could have won themselves on another night. It was an entertaining game, and both teams are heading in the right direction.

They go back to the top of Group B1, and a draw against Ukraine in Poland on Tuesday will seal the deal. Scotland fans savour the victory. Photograph: Russell Cheyne/Reuters\n\nUpdated at 16.49 EDT\n\n2d ago 16.36 90 min +3: McGinn channels his inner Lioness by holding the ball up near the corner flag, under pressure from four orange shirts. Fine clock management.\n\n\n\n2d ago 16.35 90 min +2: Robinson crosses from the left. Knight heads harmlessly goalwards. Gordon claims, then launches a counter. Fraser skitters down the right and is cleaned out by Brady, who goes into the book.\n\n\n\n2d ago 16.34 90 min +1: Nothing much happens in the first one, but Hampden is on edge anyway.\n\n\n\n2d ago 16.33 89 min: Collins curls in from the right, forcing McKenna into conceding a corner. It’s no good, and Ogbene can’t recycle possession. Scotland break upfield through Fraser, who should set up McGregor for the clincher, but attempts a curler towards the bottom-right corner instead. Easy for Bazunu.\n\n\n\n2d ago 16.31 87 min: Hendry and Cullen are given the once-over by VAR for some afters in the wake of that brouhaha. Nothing serious has occurred, though. We play on.\n\n\n\n2d ago 16.30 86 min: McGinn clips Cullen, lighting the touchpaper. A rumble erupts. Then McTominay and Knight grapple. Both are booked. McTominay will now miss the Ukraine game. Sheer idiocy. It’s grapple time. Photograph: Lee Smith/Action/Reuters\n\nUpdated at 16.37 EDT\n\n2d ago 16.28 85 min: A double change by Scotland. Christie and Dykes are replaced by McLean and Adams.\n\n\n\n2d ago 16.26 84 min: McTominay swings one in from the right. Dykes can’t quite get his head onto the ball. Any connection there, and Bazunu would have had some work to do.\n\n\n\n2d ago 16.26 83 min: Hampden is rocking now. Ireland respond by sending on Brady for McClean.\n\n\n\n2d ago 16.25 GOAL! Scotland 2-1 Republic of Ireland (Christie 82 pen) Christie gives Bazunu the eyes. He waits for the keeper to dive to his right. Then he rolls calmly down the middle. Superb penalty kick!

Photograph: Bruce White/Colorsport/Shutterstock\n\nUpdated at 16.56 EDT\n\n2d ago 16.24 81 min: VAR double checks. Coleman is booked for protesting. The decision stands. Christie to take.\n\n\n\n2d ago 16.24 Penalty for Scotland! 80 min: McTominay goes up for a header on the penalty spot. Browne comes at him from behind with both arms extended forward. McTominay flicks a header onto his right arm, and the referee points to the spot! Alan Browne of Republic of Ireland contends for the aerial ball with Scott McTominay of Scotland, before a penalty is awarded for handball. Photograph: Ian MacNicol/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 16.33 EDT\n\n2d ago 16.22 79 min: Ralston crosses from the right. Egan half clears. The ball drops to McGregor, who chests down on the edge of the D and fires towards the bottom right. The ball deflects out for a corner, from which …\n\n\n\n2d ago 16.20 77 min: McClean whips a dangerous cross in from the left. Christie, surrounded by orange shirts, does extremely well to head clear from the edge of his six-yard box. Such a fine ball by McClean.\n\n\n\n2d ago 16.19 76 min: Doherty’s race is run. He’s replaced by Coleman, while Parrott and Molumby make way for Robinson and Browne.\n\n\n\n2d ago 16.18 75 min: Collins launches long. Ogbene tears clear! But upon reaching the Scotland box, he floats a chip over the bar, and the flag goes up for offside anyway.\n\n\n\n2d ago 16.17 74 min: Fraser floats a poor free kick into the box, and it’s an easy catch for Bazunu.\n\n\n\n2d ago 16.16 73 min: A long pass down the left wing is flicked on by Dykes. Christie knocks it past Egan, who cynically blocks his man. The Ireland captain goes into the book.\n\n\n\n2d ago 16.15 72 min: Doherty goes down and requires a bit of treatment. He might just be trying to catch his breath, having played very little football this season. He’s back up again soon enough.\n\n\n\n2d ago 16.14 71 min: Doherty bundles Christie over on the left. Scotland load the box, only to start pushing and a-shoving. The whistle goes to release the pressure on Ireland.\n\n\n\n2d ago 16.13 69 min: McGregor launches an attack by striding down the middle. He passes right to McGinn, who shuttles the ball further to Fraser. He drops a shoulder and sends a curler towards the top left. Bazunu, at full stretch, tips around the post. The resulting corner is flicked on by McGinn, and McTominay prepares to head home at the far stick … only for Doherty to get in at the death with a clearing header! Great play all round. Scotland's Scott McTominay (third right) misses a chance. Photograph: Steve Welsh/PA\n\nUpdated at 16.29 EDT\n\n2d ago 16.11 67 min: … so having said that, Fraser goes up the other end and floats one in from the right flank. McGinn goes up for a header, doesn’t make it, falls over, and claims a penalty. He’s not getting one. Just a corner, from which nothing comes. This match isn’t of the highest quality, but it’s great back-and-forth fun.\n\n\n\n2d ago 16.09 66 min: Knight has a dig from distance. It’s always flying wide right. Ireland look much the more likely right now.\n\n\n\n2d ago 16.08 65 min: Ogbene strides down the middle and slips wide left for McClean. His low cross tees up Molumby, who smashes a shot goalwards. It’s blocked, and Scotland clear their lines, but the hosts were all over the place there. They can’t handle the pace and positivity of Ogbene at all.\n\n\n\n2d ago 16.06 64 min: McKenna makes up for his mistake by heading Cullen’s free kick clear.\n\n\n\n2d ago 16.06 63 min: Ogbene’s pace is causing Scotland all sorts of trouble. He drops a shoulder to get past McKenna down the right. McKenna cynically brings him down and goes into the book. A free kick near the right-hand corner flag.\n\n\n\n2d ago 16.05 61 min: Scotland over-elaborate at the corner. A load of nonsense. Ireland go up the other end. Gordon looks to hack clear, but only manages to flipper the ball straight to the feet of Ogbene, who immediately fires back. It’s straight at Gordon. The keeper snaffles, and breathes a sigh of relief. Very nearly an old-school goalkeeping fiasco.\n\n\n\n2d ago 16.03 60 min: Obafemi is replaced by Ogbene. When play restarts, Christie makes good down the left and sends an outswinger towards the far post. Dykes prepares to head home, but McClean nips in to concede a corner instead.\n\n\n\n2d ago 16.02 58 min: Nothing comes of the Ireland corner. Hickey, however, has picked up an injury and is replaced by Ralston. Armstrong meanwhile makes way for Fraser.\n\n\n\n2d ago 16.01 56 min: … Ireland nearly score on the counter! McGregor’s loose pass is snaffled by Obafemi, and suddenly he’s tearing off towards the Scotland half. Christie tries to clean him out with a cynical foul but misses his man. Obafemi strides upfield, then rolls to the left for Parrott, who is one on one with Gordon! He’s got to score … but scuffs his shot straight at Gordon, who nevertheless parries magnificently. Corner. Scotland goalkeeper Craig Gordon (right) saves a shot by Republic of Ireland's Troy Parrott. Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA\n\nUpdated at 16.12 EDT\n\n2d ago 15.59 55 min: Scotland are first to everything now. McGregor finds Dykes on the penalty spot. Dykes swivels and shoots but O’Shea blocks. Scotland quickly come again, Dykes meeting a right-wing cross with a close-range header … only for Collins to knock out for a corner. From which …\n\n\n\n2d ago 15.56 53 min: McGinn finds himself in a pocket of space, 30 yards out from goal. He could take a couple of strides forward, but likes the look of things, and takes an instant shot. His daisycutter is always heading wide right. Full marks for backing yourself, if nothing else.\n\n\n\n2d ago 15.55 52 min: Ireland nearly hit back immediately, McGregor shipping possession in the middle of the park, Doherty striding into the box from the right. He drops a shoulder and lines up a curler towards the top left … but gets it all wrong. Goal kick.\n\n\n\n2d ago 15.54 51 min: That was a fine header by Hendry, who finished off the move he started himself. Hampden is bubbling now.\n\n\n\n2d ago 15.53 GOAL! Scotland 1-1 Republic of Ireland (Hendry 49) Hendry strides down the middle of the park then slides a pass wide left for Taylor, who shuttles it on to Christie. Christie stands one up into the middle. Hendry rises highest and sends a slow-motion header across Bazunu, off the base of the right-hand post, and in. Hampden erupts! Jack Hendry heads Scotland level. Photograph: Ian MacNicol/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 16.04 EDT\n\n2d ago 15.50 47 min: Taylor gives the ball away in midfield and is fortunate Doherty pushes Parrott too far out to the right with his pass. Ireland recycle possession, McClean firing in low from the other flank. McGregor intercepts and hoicks clear. A fast start to the half by Ireland.\n\n\n\n2d ago 15.48 Scotland get the second half underway. There have been no half-time changes.\n\n\n\n2d ago 15.33 HALF TIME: Scotland 0-1 Republic of Ireland Ireland are halfway to doing a number on Scotland again.\n\n\n\n2d ago 15.32 45 min +1: Cullen very nearly picks up a second yellow in short order, sliding in late on an in-flight Hickey. The referee’s done him a favour there. The resulting free kick is sent into the mixer, and Dykes has his shot blocked by Egan.\n\n\n\n2d ago 15.31 45 min: Cullen is booked for reacting badly to Knight’s garden variety foul on McGinn. The referee not having any of his yap.\n\n\n\n2d ago 15.29 44 min: Doherty chases a ball down the right wing. Taylor shepherds it out of play. Doherty bundles into the back of him and accidentally studs him on the back of the leg. A sore one, but thankfully the newly arrived left-back is quickly up and about again.\n\n\n\n2d ago 15.28 43 min: McGinn’s corner is poor and flies straight down Bazunu’s throat.\n\n\n\n2d ago 15.27 42 min: Tierney disappears down the tunnel. He’s replaced by Greg Taylor. Meanwhile Dykes strides down the right and wins Scotland a corner.\n\n\n\n2d ago 15.26 40 min: Ireland deal with the second corner. Scotland are down to ten men for a minute as a final decision is made on Tierney.\n\n",

And fittingly the 30-year-old was joined on the Late Late Show by legendary runner O'Sullivan to reflect on her stellar season.\n\nRead next: \"I know I am clean...\" - Ciara Mageean hits back at critics\n\nMageean received plenty of praise on social media for her appearance on the show, with people championing her as a brilliant role model for young women in sport.\n\nOne person said: \"You’d run a long way to find a better role model for your daughters than Ciara Mageean.\"\n\nThe Co Down athlete also told of her dream of hearing Ireland's national anthem playing as she competed and won medals and spoke about how she believed in the modern day Northern Ireland and winning Commonwealth Games silver.\n\n(Image: INPHO/Morgan Treacy)\n\nWhen asked about representing both nations, the Portaferry woman replied: \"It is something that I'm proud of to be able to go out and race for Ireland year in year out but I get the opportunity to race for Northern Ireland once every four years.

    "Ireland need Jeff Hendrick's influence off the bench in certain scenarios": "Irish Journalist Dan McDonnell joined Joe Molloy on The Football Show to discuss Ireland's midfield.\n\nIreland suffered a disappointing loss to Scotland in Hampden Park.\n\nIt was disappointing because they played well and still lost. Alan Browne's handball was silly. It gave Scotland the game-winning penalty, and there were plenty of other missed opportunities too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, Ireland played well for the most part. The back three of John Egan, Nathan Collins and Dara O'Shea excelled together. Michael Obafemi and Troy Parrott continue to develop their relationship. Matt Doherty returned in a decent display and the midfield trio battled hard for 90 minutes.\n\nBut there was a lack of control in Ireland's performance. Scotland showed their experience during the second half and Joe Molloy couldn't help but notice Ireland lacked that same quality.\n\n\"There were definitely periods in the second half when Scotland had control of the game,\" Molloy said.\n\n\"We almost did that too readily and you would love if that midfield three had almost said...'We might just try to take the sting out of this game a touch.' Now I don't know if that's experience or nous or maybe they were under strict instructions to get it forward, that's the way we hurt them.\n\n\"But that was definitely a feeling watching the game.\"\n\nDan McDonnell agreed with Molloy.\n\nNone of Cullen, Knight nor Molumby controlled possession or dictated the play. They weren't bad on the ball, but they didn't understand how or have the ability to slow the game down when Ireland needed them to.\n\nMcDonnell explains it's an area that Ireland are concerned about.\n\n\"To a degree this comes back to quality of player in this department,\" McDonnell said.\n\n\"There's no doubt that where Ireland lack depth at the minute is in those midfield positions...That midfield, Knight and Molumby, probably more so picked for their off the ball work rate than their on the ball abilities. Although Molumby I think has improved on the ball...and Knight is a very good player, but he's someone who makes breaks and latches onto attacks.\n\n\"You don't necessarily have [someone like] Callum McGregor who controls things a small bit more.\"\n\nWill Smallbone and Gavin Kilkenny are potential call-ups for the November internationals. The under-21 team doesn't have fixtures during that window. Smallbone is particularly exciting, but Kilkenny is closer to the quarterback-style passer who will sit deep and slow the game down when Ireland need him to.\n\nBut neither player is an option for Tuesday night and neither player is even guaranteed to make the next squad.\n\nInstead, Ireland can look at their current bench. Jeff Hendrick has more experience than any other Ireland midfielder. He played well for Kenny previously and McDonnell reckons he could have made a difference for Ireland on Saturday.\n\n\"He's an unpopular player with sections of the fanbase...something different would have been bringing in Jeff Hendrick. On a good day, and there have been good days under Kenny. [He's] a good passer and he has a bit of a presence.\n\n\"With his experience he could have taken a bit of the sting out of it. It was a bit frantic, the game in general.\"\n\nMatt Doherty is expecting big things.\n\nFootball on Off The Ball brought to you by Sky.

    "Maersk increases its warehousing capabilities in UK and Ireland": "Press releases Maersk increases its warehousing capabilities in UK and Ireland Share LinkedIn Facebook Twitter Email Copy link WeChat\n\nLiverpool/Dublin – As part of its integrator strategy, Maersk is consistently expanding its inventory of warehouses in the UK and Ireland. In addition to a 15-year lease for a newly built warehouse in Doncaster in the North of England, Maersk has signed a lease for two new distribution centres in the Irish capital Dublin. All the facilities have a strong focus on their operations creating low CO2 emissions. The Doncaster facility is part of the G Park Doncaster Mammoth 602 development and perfectly connected via road (close to five motorways), rail (Doncaster International Railport), and air (Robin Hood Airport). With more than 600,000 sq ft total space, 60 dock levellers, 20m internal clear height as well as several hundred parking spaces and offices the warehouse is one of the largest in UK. It ranks also among the most sustainable logistics buildings in the North of England. The developer GLP has built the facility on a net zero carbon scheme for construction (within the UKGBC framework). In addition to the warehouse in Doncaster, Maersk’s portfolio comprises two other distribution centers in the UK in Tamworth and Kettering.\n\nIn Ireland, Maersk has signed a lease for renting two new warehouses in the Quantum Logistics Park in the North of Dublin. The units 3 and 4 within Quantum Logistics Park will feature a combined space of 250,000 sq ft and will be built to fulfill the sustainability standards of LEED Gold and BREEAM Excellent ratings. The Dublin based developer IPUT Real Estate will complete the two warehouses in Q4 2022 and Q2 2023, while unit 4 will also become Ireland’s first net zero logistics building using a glue-laminated timber structural frame. Quantum Logistics Park is strategically located 2 km from Dublin airport and 15 km from Dublin port with immediate access to the M2 motorway.\n\nThese three new warehouses in the UK and Ireland are a strong statement that we are ready to deliver on our integrator promise to our customers and serve them with end-to-end logistics solutions from factory to their end-consumers if they wish. The demand for integrated and thus more resilient supply chains has grown significantly over the past two years. The disruptions of Brexit and the pandemic moved the logistics from a commodity level to a C-level topic – where it actually belongs. Gary Jeffreys Area Managing Director UK & Ireland\n\nAs decarbonization of sea, air and land logistics by 2040 is an integral part of Maersk’s strategy, we are happy to partner with two very capable developers which help us to deliver on that ambitious goal in landside logistics. Following the successful acquisition of the warehousing specialist LF Logistics in Asia, Maersk today offers its customers integrated logistics solutions in more than 550 warehouses with a total global space of around 9.5 million sqm. Several additional Maersk warehouses are planned to go into operation in Europe in the coming months. As an integrator of logistics, Maersk is developing and providing solutions ranging from ocean transportation to landside and air transportation, contract logistics including warehousing & distribution (W&D) and depots, custom clearances, visibility solutions and more. When supply chains were impacted due to the disruptions caused by the pandemic, Maersk’s resilient end-to-end solutions ensured customers’ cargo kept moving. The integrated solutions allow Maersk to have greater control over the movement of the cargo at multiple stages of its journey and thus bring resilience to the supply chains. With the expansion of W&D facilities, Maersk is strengthening its position further by providing a larger array of services out of one hand to its customers. About A.P. Moller - Maersk A.P.

    "American in Ireland? It's time to register to vote for the US midterm elections": "Democrats Abroad Ireland is encouraging some 25,000 eligible American voters in Ireland ahead to vote in the US midterm elections, which will this year be held on Tuesday, November 8.\n\nPatti Shields, chair of Democrats Abroad Ireland, recently told BreakingNews.ie that the group is encouraging Americans in Ireland to register to vote and request their ballots before October 5.\n\nUS citizens living (or working or traveling) outside the US have the right to vote in US Federal elections, which occur every two years and include all 435 seats in the US House of Representatives along with one-third of the US Senate seats.\n\nVoters living outside of the US can register to vote on VoteFromAbroad.org, which, although is a public service provided by Democratic Party Committee, voters from any party affiliation can use.\n\nShields said: \"When we do our VoteFromAbroad.org, our general voter outreach, which is really I'd say 90 percent of what I'm doing right now, we do that in a non-partisan way. We support the act of registering to vote without partisanship.\n\n\"The website we refer people to for voting is completely non-partisan in terms of you go all the way through the process of registering to vote, then at the end of the process if you care to hear more about Democrats Abroad it will take you to a page to go there.\"\n\nThe process to register to vote via VoteFromAbroad.org \"takes about seven minutes,\" Shields said.\n\n\"You need to know your old address, if you have an old social security number you need the last four digits but if you don't have that there are other ways to do it, the process itself is quite easy. You just need to do it far enough in advance.\"\n\nShe added: \"Some of the ballots are mailed, they're sent to some voters electronically... it varies by state, but most ballots need to be mailed back, or a copy needs to be mailed back.\n\n\"You need to mail something back. You just have to do it well enough in advance that it can be received in time for the election. The mail services in our current countries and the US I still don't think have fully recovered from Covid, things take a bit longer, so we're encouraging people to get out and do it sooner rather than later.\"\n\nThe first ballots began to be delivered on September 24, which Democrats Abroad marked with an online Ballot Day Rally, which featured candidates in some of \"the most competitive and crucial races in the country,\" as well as special guests, including Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick, encouraging people to voters to complete and return their ballots.\n\nShields explained: \"In most states, you can electronically submit your ballot request and your registration completely electronically, so you don't even need a printer anymore... you can digitally capture your signature.\n\n\"We do one-on-one voter assistance and help them manage steps as simple as getting the piece of paper in front of the camera, that kind of thing.\n\n\"I think the fact that in the past three years there's been a growing number of voters and population moving here [in Ireland] and also them being very aware and very participative in the US electoral process just speaks to the relationship between the US and Ireland.\"",
    "Northern Ireland power sharing slips to 2023 as few relish a winter election": "The UK has given a six-month deadline for the Northern Ireland protocol row to be resolved, indicating Liz Truss is far more relaxed about the absence of a devolved government in Stormont than previously indicated.\n\nAn April 2023 date for the resolution of the Brexit row emerged after a meeting between the prime minister and the US president, Joe Biden, and would coincide with the 25th anniversary of the Belfast Good Friday agreement.\n\nBut the deadline extension means power sharing in Northern Ireland is, in effect, paused until next year despite legislation requiring elections this year if the parties cannot agree to return to Stormont.\n\nParties elected in May were given 24 weeks, or until 28 October, to form a new executive at Stormont, but the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) has been boycotting power sharing until the Northern Ireland protocol row is resolved.\n\nThe April deadline creates a challenge for the newly appointed Northern Ireland secretary, Chris Heaton-Harris.\n\nUnder legislation brought in by his predecessor, Brandon Lewis, he is obliged to call a Northern Ireland assembly election if an executive is not formed by 28 October.\n\nThis week, on his second only visit to Northern Ireland, he said that is exactly what he would do.\n\n“It’s not an idle threat – it’s not a threat at all. It’s a fact that the legislation says that I need to do that on 28 October,” he said.\n\nFew, however, believe that can now happen.\n\nNone of the parties want a Christmas election. The Ulster Unionist party leader, Doug Beattie, described the prospect of a winter election as “absolutely diabolical”.\n\nCensus results released on Thursday showed Catholics outnumbered Protestants for the first time in the 100-year history of Northern Ireland.\n\nJon Tonge, a professor of British and Irish politics at Liverpool University, said this confirmed that the religious basis for the state was no longer there.\n\nHowever, it doesn’t mean unionism would be eliminated in the next election.\n\nThe census figures show that the majority of passport holders hold a British document, and that 17% of people do not identify with any religion, underlining the power of the centrist Alliance party, which came second in May’s election.\n\nTonge said: “All a Christmas election would do is help Sinn Féin further crush the SDLP. It would perhaps allow the DUP to win back some votes from the Traditional Unionist Voice but we would end up with the same standoff over the protocol.”\n\nIt appears likely that Heaton-Harris will legislate to extend the 24-week deadline to form an executive at Stormont, rather than force a new election.\n\nDoes this all mean a protocol resolution is more likely, and can the US be the broker of such a deal? Tonge said both Biden and Truss were “pledging absolute fidelity to the Good Friday agreement”, but those pledges meant different things to each side. The British side was focused on getting the DUP back into Stormont and more compromises from the EU, while the US was focused on the Irish perspective.\n\nWe can expect forked tongues in the next few weeks. Truss wants a negotiated deal and has limited bandwidth for Northern Ireland, but will keep the Brexit fire burning for domestic party reasons. “She is not going to be throwing flowers and love at the EU at her first party conference as prime minister,” Tonge said.",

We want to back that up with a strong performance tomorrow night.\n\n\"We are looking to constantly improve. We know there are areas we can improve, we are not naive to suggest that isn't the case,\" added Kenny.\n\n\"We saw against Ukraine, on their day when they had everyone, how good they can be, and two good games against Scotland. We are constantly looking to improve.\n\nKenny has promoted a number of young players to the senior side from his time at the U21 side.

You can see players that are only going to get better, that are on an upward curve in their careers, and they will only improve when they get into the European Championship qualifiers from March to November next year.'\n\n\"In a year's time they will be even better, you can see that and that's by design. The players themselves have done that. They have got themselves into the team by their performances at club level and with the international team.\"\n\nIreland play Armenia at 18.15 tomorrow",
    "Ben Collins – Unionists are already having conversations about a united Ireland": "Ben Collins's new book Irish Unity – Time to Prepare\n\nFor me the Good Friday Agreement was an amazing achievement. It brought to an end the Troubles and secured the peace, however imperfect, which we now enjoy. On a personal level it also enabled me to think about my own sense of identity and how I wanted to see Northern Ireland develop. It allowed me to think about a united Ireland and whether I wanted there to be one, in a way which had not been possible before. Until that point I was determined that I was not going to be forced into a united Ireland through violence or the threats of violence.\n\nI had been a student in Dundee while the Good Friday Agreement was negotiated and returned to Belfast just after the referendum had passed. There was a sense of hope that Northern Ireland could become an economic powerhouse. We are still waiting for that to happen. After the Northern Ireland Assembly collapsed in 2001 I returned to Scotland. I had joined the Conservatives just before I moved because I believed in enterprise and was keen to get involved with bread and butter politics. While I had hoped and expected that Ken Clarke would become leader and take the party in a more liberal and pro-European direction, the opposite happened. I was alarmed at their increasing hostility towards Europe. At the same time I heard the SNP talk about fiscal autonomy which really appealed to me. I left the Conservative party after two years.\n\nBeing away from Northern Ireland I was able to embrace my growing sense of Irishness and desire for Irish unity. The beauty of the Good Friday Agreement was that you could be Irish, British, European or all three. Borders were increasingly irrelevant until the EU referendum. While I realised that the vote would be a lot closer than people originally thought, I was genuinely shocked when the UK, or more specifically England and Wales voted for Brexit.\n\nWhile Irish unity had been a long term aspiration of mine, it became an urgent necessity for me after the vote for Brexit. The six years since the vote have been distressing and unsettling in many ways. Members of my own immediate family and close friends voted for Brexit. I do not think that anyone is happy with how it has turned out. My sense of Britishness had dissipated over time and seeing elderly men in Sunderland celebrating the vote to leave the European Union struck me as such an alien idea.\n\nThe idea to write a book on Irish unity came to me in July 2012 just before the London Olympics. I could tell that politics across the UK was changing when the Scottish referendum was called. The UK government intended to win by a clear two to one margin to put the issue to rest for a generation, but the final vote was much closer. It was only after the Brexit vote that I decided to focus seriously on setting out my thoughts on how we could achieve a New Ireland.\n\nI know that Irish unity has been an aspirational ideal for many people for a long time. But when you consider the damage which is being done to the island of Ireland by Brexit, there is now a hard-headed rationale for planning and preparing now.\n\nLike several thousand other people I will be travelling to Dublin on Saturday to attend the Ireland’s Future event ‘Together We Can’ in the 3Arena and I look forward to speaking at it. While political unionism rarely engages in the debate on Irish unity, I know from personal experience that people from unionist backgrounds are already taking part in this conversation. It may not often be happening out in the open, but these discussions are taking place. Often these private chats will cover the same points, Brexit is a disaster, Westminster is dysfunctional and political unionism is completely out of touch. People are open to a different future but they want to know what this will involve and what will it mean for them and their families. In a very small way I hope to add to this conversation with my book ‘Irish Unity: Time to Prepare’ and play my part in helping us to plan and prepare in advance of the border poll which I think is likely at some point over the next decade. I believe that we can win that vote and it will be a success if we have a plan in place beforehand.\n\n:: 'Irish Unity: Time to Prepare' by Ben Collins is published by Luath Press and will be launched at Belfast's Linen Hall Library on Thursday October 6.",
    "From Queen Elizabeth to King Charles: how Northern Ireland’s unionists feel about the monarchy": "Monarchism is embedded in Northern Ireland’s Ulster unionist identity. There is probably no such thing as a “republican unionist”. Many unionists descend from Protestant settlers from Britain who colonised Ireland four centuries ago. Loyalty to the monarch was an essential qualification for those making the journey, and the basis of that loyalty was the Protestantism of the crown, which provided a bulwark against the Catholicism of the Irish and much of Europe.\n\nAs Britain’s global reach grew, Protestants in Ireland shared in what was believed to be the God-ordained prosperity and power of the empire. As Irish nationalism grew in the late 19th century, Protestants clung to the union with Britain to avoid absorption into what they feared would be a hostile all-Ireland state.\n\nTo this day, unlike the many people around the world who see the British monarchy as a symbol of oppression, unionists view it as the embodiment of their political and religious liberty.\n\nAfter the partition of Ireland in 1921, as James Loughlin writes in his history of the British crown in Ireland, “continued Unionist anxieties about constitutional security put a primacy on an enhanced identity with the monarchy”. Royal visits were used by the unionist government to legitimise their regime and affirm, for people at home and in Britain, their rightful place in the UK.\n\nIn Queen Elizabeth, unionists found a strong supporter. At her coronation in 1952, apparently at her wishes, war-time generals, aristocrats and politicians from Ulster held prominent ceremonial functions. Royal honours were bestowed on Northern Ireland subjects. Two swans were donated to Portadown.\n\nAlamy/Reuters\n\nBut as Loughlin argues, royal endorsement merely stoked unionists’ complacency about their unjust practice of government. That practice was unsustainable and ultimately disintegrated amid the violence of the Troubles which began at the end of the 1960s.\n\nIn that conflict, unionist or “loyalist” paramilitaries were imprisoned in droves by the very state for which they were fighting. Their fidelity to the Queen but not her government led to them being described, in the title of a classic 1977 book on Ulster loyalism, as Queen’s Rebels. “Their only crime was loyalty,” went a loyalist slogan.\n\nAfter the Troubles\n\nIn the peace process era, royal paraphernalia was inevitably drawn into Northern Ireland’s cultural battles. Unionists believed that republicans and nationalists wanted to eliminate all monarchical trappings, as had happened in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe proposal made in 1999 by the Patten Commission on police reform to remove the title “Royal Ulster Constabulary” from the police and the crown symbol from the police badge met with universal unionist anger. Nationalists countered that the equality mandated by the 1998 Good Friday Agreement meant that British cultural ascendancy had to end.\n\nToday, few unionists would point to the Protestantism of the monarchy as the foundation of their political allegiance. That said, Queen Elizabeth’s Christian faith, expressed especially in her Christmas speeches, enhanced her personal appeal within the unionist community where there remains an affinity with Protestant evangelicalism and a respect for public piety.\n\nWhile the Queen’s death has been deeply felt in unionist areas, Northern Ireland’s royalists and loyalists will be reassured by King Charles’s promises of continuity with his mother’s approach to the role. The Queen will remain in the unionist imagination, along with other figures from the past, as an exemplar and beacon of their Britishness.\n\nBut rather than being an unyielding symbol of continuity, the monarchy will reflect changing political circumstances. King Charles is at ease in the Republic of Ireland and appears unperturbed by the rise of Sinn Féin in the North (he actually seemed to congratulate Sinn Féin on becoming the largest party when he visited Northern Ireland in the days following the Queen’s death).\n\nAlamy\n\nWhile footage of the Queen’s historic 2011 visit to Ireland has been replayed again and again, a less remembered but just as potent episode was the visit of the then-Prince Charles to Mullaghmore in County Sligo in 2015. He attended a service of reconciliation, shook hands with Irish republican leader Gerry Adams, and went to the location where his great uncle Lord Mountbatten, with whom he was close, was killed by the IRA in 1979. His visits to the Republic have become routine.\n\nMeanwhile, unionists are reluctant to recognise the Irish identity of nationalists in Northern Ireland and to act as deputy to a Sinn Féin first minister since republicans’ success in May’s Assembly election. Their attitudes towards the Irish government have hardened since Brexit.\n\nIn a future referendum on Irish unity, unionists must maximise the electorate’s identification with the UK. This suggests that emulating the generosity towards traditional enemies shown by their revered late queen and her successor would be unionists’ most effective political strategy.",
    "Preview: Ireland U21s chase the dream in Israel": "It was honours even after the European Under-21 Championship play-off first leg at Tallaght Stadium on Friday night, but the sense in the aftermath was it's advantage Israel ahead of the return game on Tuesday.\n\nIreland had the chances to establish a good lead in Dublin.\n\nThe impressive Aaron Connolly, Willl Smallbone and Eiran Cashin all went close before Idan Gorno struck for the visitors with a header from a corner. Evan Ferguson soared to glance home a deserved second-half equaliser, but Ireland are facing a massive challenge in Tel Aviv, where temperatures are expected to be around 28 degrees come kick-off time.\n\nIsrael have shown Crawford's team ample respect by calling back three players from the senior squad for the second leg.\n\nCeltic attacker Liel Abada, Olympiacos full-back Doron Leidner and Eden Kartsev of Maccabi Tel Aviv are all available having helped the seniors to a 2-1 UEFA Nations League win over Albania on Saturday.\n\nHowever Crawford will not be doing likewise, despite Gavin Bazunu, Troy Parrott, Nathan Collins, Jason Knight and Michael Obafemi being eligible. They will stick with Stephen Kenny's senior squad for the Aviva Stadium clash against Armenia.\n\nMeanwhile Crawford remains upbeat and quietly confident his charges are good enough to make history and qualify Ireland for a first ever major finals at the U-21 grade.\n\n\"I thought it was a very good performance on Friday,\" he told RTÉ Sport.\n\n\"It was disappointing to concede a goal from a set play. It's something we work a lot on, but these things happen. The players showed resilience and character to get themselves back into the game.\n\n\"I do think we can raise our game even more with the players we have. I have no doubt we'll be able to do that.\n\n\"Of course you'd have regrets you missed chances. On another day we could have been a coupe of goals up after the first leg, and I think the real measure of our performance was that they have drafted down three players from the senior team. It's going to be a stiffer challenge, there's not doubt about it, but I think with the quality we have in our squad, we'll be okay.\"\n\n\"I do think we can raise our game even more with the players we have\" - Ireland U21s boss Jim Crawford spoke to @darrenfrehill ahead of Tuesday's massive Euros play-off in Israel, live on the @RTEplayer (6.15pm ko) #RTEsoccer pic.twitter.com/bOyfm2fYF6 — RTÉ Soccer (@RTEsoccer) September 26, 2022\n\nFerguson is nursing an ankle knock but he's expected to be OK. Bar that, Ireland have a clean bill of health.\n\nHaving really gone at the Israelis in Tallaght, the complexion of the game is likely to be a lot different at Bloomfield Stadium. Certainly Israel will look to take the game to their hosts a lot more, buoyed by the returning trio of Abada, Leidner and Kartsev, plus a partisan crowd that will expect them to play on the front foot.\n\nCrawford also admitted that the heat may dictate the Irish approach.\n\n\"You have to factor that in too, to go after a team for 90 minutes in those type of conditions can be challenging,\" he added.\n\n\"You've got to pick and choose your moments to get after teams. Our boys are clever enough. They'll be well versed on what we've got to do.\"\n\nThere's some seasoned Irish campaigners who have been with the group for a long time now. Among them is Lee O'Connor, the tigerish Tranmere Rovers caps full-back desperate to make the big breakthrough.\n\nO'Connor has been a mainstay of Ireland squads from U-15s up.

    "Can Ireland's bumper savings be put to good use?": "Limited spending options and fears of what was to come turned Irish consumers into great savers during pandemic lockdowns.\n\nEven as the economy reopened, the average household was saving far more of their income than before – though recent data suggests the rising prices are forcing that to change.\n\nThis means that there is a huge bulk of money sitting in Irish bank accounts at the moment – right at a time when households, businesses and politicians search for ways to cover the rising cost of living.\n\nHow much money do people here have saved?\n\nWe need your consent to load this rte-player contentWe use rte-player to manage extra content that can set cookies on your device and collect data about your activity. Please review their details and accept them to load the content.Manage Preferences\n\nA huge amount – somewhere in the region of €146 billion by the end of July, according to the most recent figures from the Central Bank.\n\nTo put that into context, the upcoming budget is estimated to be worth around €6.5 billion– and that's a far bigger figure than it would be in a normal year, because of the billions of euro that are planned around the cost of living.\n\nSo the people of Ireland have more than 22 bumper budgets worth of cash sitting in their bank accounts at the moment.\n\nAnd that figure has ballooned significantly in the past two and a half years – because people saved an extraordinary amount during the pandemic.\n\nComparing the February 2020 figure with the July 2022 figure, there’s nearly €35 billion more in our savings. That’s the kind of money it would normally take a decade or more to build up.\n\nIt works out at about €28,600 for every person in the country.\n\nBut I don’t have anything like that in my bank account…\n\nUnfortunately, all of that money isn’t very evenly distributed.\n\nAnd, unsurprisingly, it’s the country’s higher earners that tend to hold the bulk of the money saved.\n\nIt should be said that most people in the country do have some level of savings – recent figures from the Central Statistics Office says that nearly 97% of households have some form of savings.\n\nBut the amount in those savings accounts tends to decline in line with the amount of disposable income a person has.\n\nThere are also links between the likelihood of having savings and your level of education, and whether someone is living in their own house or whether they’re renting.\n\nAnd that inequality in savings was only enhanced by the pandemic.\n\nIf you were to take two types of workers – let’s say, a high-earning tech worker, and regular retail worker.\n\nThere’s already a huge difference in their earnings here – but when the pandemic hit, the tech worker was able to continue doing their job from home, pretty much with no interruption.\n\nThat means their earnings stayed the same, in some cases they actually increased, and because they couldn’t go anywhere, suddenly all of their socialising money started building up in their bank account.\n\nThe retail worker also wouldn’t have had much available to spend their money on, but because they were forced to stop working altogether, and put onto the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, they didn’t have much in the way of disposable income left once their bills were taken care of.\n\nAre we still saving our money?\n\nAs the economy began to reopen, there was lots of discussion about what might happen with all of the savings built up during the height of the pandemic.\n\nThere were some – particularly retailers – who hoped that there might be some kind of post-lockdown spending spree.\n\nConsumer spending did rise – and some people seemed to put their savings towards some big ticket items, like a trip abroad. Some of the rapid rise in house prices has also been attributed to people directing their savings towards a deposit on a new home.\n\nBut while spending has been higher than before, it’s definitely not been the splurge that some had expected.\n\nIn fact, so far it seems as though people have continued their savings habit even as life returned to normal.\n\nThe most recent Household Savings stats from the CSO shows that people were still putting away almost 20% of their income in the middle of the year.\n\nThat’s about double the pre-pandemic average.\n\nPerhaps people realised that they were able to save more than they previously thought possible – or perhaps it shows that households are remaining cautious, particularly given the context of the war in Ukraine and talk of a recession in the Euro Zone.\n\nIt should be said, though, that these CSO figures only bring us to June – before the cost of living crisis really started to bite.\n\nA more recent survey from the Bank of Ireland shows that people are now saving less than they feel they should, because they simply can’t afford to.\n\nSo if we’re not spending it, what options do savers have to get the most out of their money?\n\nWell, if they’re looking to save it – there’s not a lot on offer at the moment.\n\nAcross the board, savings accounts are offering next to nothing in terms of interest – and that’s been the case ever since the European Central Bank dropped its interest rates to zero.\n\nECB interest rates are on the rise but so far the main Irish banks – outside of tracker mortgages - haven’t yet passed those on.\n\nThat’s good news for those on a variable mortgage, or someone with a personal loan, but it’s bad news for savers, because it means they’re not yet benefitting from the interest rate.\n\nFor those looking for a return on their money, investments are of course an option – but only if you have a lump sum of money that you’re happy to put out of reach for a couple of years.\n\nAnd, unlike savings, there’s no guarantee with investments – so you could end up losing money, or not making an awful lot.\n\nGenerally it’s about balancing risk and reward with this kind of thing – if you want the best chance of making a great return, you need to make riskier investments.\n\nIf you want to be sure you don’t lose money, you’re going to have to go with something that promises fairly modest returns.\n\nTake, for example, a 10 Year National Solidarity Bond– which is 100% guaranteed by the State.\n\nIf you put €1,000 into that today, in 10 years time you’ll get back €1,100.\n\nAnd with the current rate of inflation…\n\nThe is the problem facing all people saving at the moment – they’re getting little or nothing for their money, and the value of that money is being whittled away by the month.\n\nFor example, if you put that €1,000 into your savings at the start of the pandemic, in terms of buying power, it’s now effectively worth less than €890 because of inflation.\n\nThe rate of inflation is expected to tail off over the next year or two – but it’s still going to be higher than desired, which means your money is slowly losing value while it’s earning you nothing.\n\nSo what other options do savers have?\n\nWell, they could spend the money – though due to inflation there’s not much value to be had, especially if they were thinking of doing something like a home renovation or upgrade.\n\nPeople may also be unwilling to let go of their savings at the moment, for fear that they need it to fall back on if their household budgets get squeezed even further, or if there’s another economic downturn that threatens their income.\n\nAnd the general personal finance advice is to keep a certain amount of cash to hand at all times – just in case your income suddenly stops, or the washing machine breaks down.\n\nSo using up all of your savings isn’t a good idea either way.\n\nBut assuming you have money beyond that recommended buffer, paying off debt is probably a good use of money at the moment, especially if it’s high interest lending like on a credit card.\n\nThe most recent Central Bank statistics tell us that household debt stood at €128 billion late last year – so not too far behind what we have saved.\n\nIf people have the money to clear some of that, it might mean reducing or even wiping out a loan repayment altogether, which will bolster their monthly budget as they head into the winter.\n\nIn fact, even if you’re just paying off a part of a loan – like your mortgage – it will ultimately stand to you.\n\nAnother option is to put money towards a pension.\n\nFor many this is about as long-term of an investment as you can make, but we do know that a lack of pensions provision is a major issue in Ireland, and it takes a long time for people to build up the kind of pension pot that they would like to have a comfortable retirement.\n\nIs there any way for the Government to tap into those savings?\n\nWell it kind of does already – for example, any interest earned is liable to Deposit Interest Retention Tax – or DIRT – at 33%.\n\nThough, given that people haven’t been earning much on their savings for the past few years, there isn’t really much money to be made from that tax at the moment.\n\nThe State Savings scheme, including things like the National Solidarity Bond and Prize Bonds are effective an attempt by Government to benefit from people’s savings, too.\n\nThat’s because they’re effectively a way for the State to borrow citizens’ money for an extended period of time, which they can then use for various investments and public services.\n\nBeyond that, though, the Government is actually in a bit of a bind when it comes to people’s savings.\n\nNormally if you were looking at businesses around the country struggling on the one hand, and billions and billions sitting in savings accounts on the other, it would make sense to try to come up with a scheme to try to unleash that cash in order to help businesses out.\n\nThink of some kind of reverse SSIA scheme that incentivises spending rather than saving.\n\nBut, if you were to do that, you run the risk of simply adding to the inflation problem at the moment – which would only prolong the pain that consumers and companies are facing right now.\n\nSo, as counter-intuitive as it seems, the Government probably doesn’t want too much money coming into the economy right now.\n\nIn fact, that’s partly why a central bank raises interest rates when it wants to cool economic activity. Because higher interest rates on your savings account – in theory at least – encourages you to save rather than spend.",

    "Ireland has ‘stubbornly high gender pay gap’, says Ictu": "Ictu president Kevin Callinan during the launch of the union's toolkit relating to guidance for unions on closing the gender pay gap. Photograph: Gareth Chaney/Collins\n\nIreland has a “stubbornly high gender pay gap”, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (Ictu) has said.\n\nKevin Callinan, president of the Ictu, said Ireland’s gender pay gap stood at 11.3 per cent, according to the latest Eurostat data, as a new guide for trade unions on gender pay gap reporting was published in Dublin on Monday.\n\nUnder new legislation which came into force earlier this year, organisations with more than 250 employees are required to report their gender pay gap for 2022 in December, with the data based on a “snapshot” date of their choosing in June.\n\nThe legislation will be extended to organisations with 150 or more employees in 2024, and those with 50 or more employees in 2025.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nMr Callinan said the Ictu believed that gender pay gap reporting legislation was potentially a “mechanism to encourage employers into tangible action to bridge the gap. It is also an opportunity for unions to negotiate actions to address pay inequality and we will be seeking engagement with employers when the first set of audit reports are published in December, in order to agree a set of measures to be taken by the employer to eliminate or reduce any gaps identified.”\n\n‘Unequal pay’\n\nDr Jane Pillinger, consultant and author of the guide, said gender pay reporting was an important milestone in “the fight against unfair and unequal pay, particularly for women workers in low paid and undervalued jobs. Trade unions have a vital role to play in finding solutions with employers and bringing unequal pay and its root causes into collective bargaining. The guidance is aimed at building union strategies and actions on gender pay gap reporting and the wider structural causes of unequal pay.”\n\nMinister for Equality Roderic O’Gorman said the introduction of gender pay gap reporting in Ireland was a “major step forward in terms of addressing gender inequality in the workplace. If a company doesn’t adhere to its obligations under the legislation, IREC, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has the power to bring those companies to court. That’s quite a sizable and important provision to make sure that there is adherence to this new law.”\n\nMr O’Gorman said it was hoped gender pay gap reporting would go “a long way towards improving our understanding of the pay gap and incentivising employers to use whatever means they can to reduce that gap. With 65 per of all employees in the State estimated to fall within the scope of the act, the publication of gender pay gap information will provide a range of data about firms and sectors and how they contribute to the gender pay gap in the economy as a whole.”",

    "Electric Ireland to tell politicians ‘no choice’ but to raise prices for customers": "Electric Ireland will tell politicians it had “no choice” but to increase customers’ bills given the “staggering” rise in gas prices.\n\nIts executive director Pat Fenlon is to appear before the Oireachtas Environment committee next week where he will be quizzed by TDs and Senators on the price increases.\n\nThe meeting was due to take place on Tuesday but it has been postponed due to the budget.\n\nThe company — which is a subsidiary of the ESB — has announced three price rises this year including increases in its standard household electricity and gas prices by 26.7 per cent and 37.5 per cent respectively from October 1st.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nElectric Ireland is the largest electricity supplier in the State with about 1.1 million residential customers.\n\nIt has approximately 170,000 residential gas customers.\n\nBudget previews, census shocks, pension policies Listen | 00:00\n\nMr Fenlon’s statement will say the ESB’s generation and supply businesses “are required to operate separately, so increased profits from ESB’s generation business cannot be used to offset costs incurred by Electric Ireland”.\n\nThis means Electric Ireland “must operate in the residential market as an entirely stand-alone supplier, buying electricity and gas from the wholesale markets and in turn selling it to customers”.\n\nOn the price rises, he will say “the significant increases in customers’ bills have been driven by extraordinary and sustained increases in the wholesale price of electricity” caused by increased gas prices “made much more acute as a result of the conflict in Ukraine and reduced Russian gas supply”.\n\nMr Fenlon will indicate there has been a 1,000 per cent increase in gas prices over 18 months.\n\n“Two years ago, Electric Ireland’s annual wholesale energy costs were in the region of €300 million; at current market levels, we expect that cost to increase to circa €2 billion. Cost increases of this order of magnitude are staggering,” he will add.\n\nHis statement will also indicate: “As we operate as a standalone energy supplier in the market, we have no choice but to increase our prices given the quantum of increase in our costs.”\n\nMr Fenlon will say Electric Ireland is “committed to helping our customers during these challenging times”.\n\nHe will note “a lower standard variable tariff for electricity than almost all competitors across the last 18 months” and engagement with customers who have difficulty paying bills.\n\nVulnerable customers\n\nMr Fenlon will also say that “disconnections are and always will be a last resort” and he will highlight the regulatory moratorium on disconnections for the winter period for vulnerable customers.\n\nElectric Ireland is also said to have launched a €3 million hardship fun similar to one in place during Covid, which will provide support to Electric Ireland customers who have difficulty paying their bills.\n\nEarlier this month the ESB group reported half-year earnings in 2022 — including a one-off gain from what it called “exceptional volatility” in global commodity markets — jumped to €390.3 million from €128.4 million a year ago.\n\nThe group recorded revenue of almost €3.7 billion, which was up from almost €2.2 billion the year before.\n\nMr Fenlon will say “the most accurate representation of ESB’s underlying financial performance during the first half of 2022 is the operating profit before exceptional items”.\n\nHe will outline how in the first half of 2022 this was €357 million compared to €363 million in the first half of 2021, a drop of €6 million.\n\nMr Fenlon will say that the ESB has recorded exceptional gains in the first half of 2022 compared to 2021 but they relate mainly to the technical accounting treatment of financial instruments and are non-cash gains which are not related to the price paid for electricity by customers.\n\nHe will also say: “ESB must earn an appropriate level of profit, so that it can service debt, reinvest in critical networks, renewable generation and other important energy infrastructure, as well as pay tax and dividends to the Government.”",

A second EU diplomat speculated that the US, which has close ties with Ireland, might have urged Dublin to side with Warsaw against more dovish EU capitals.\n\n\"We hope even more will join the group,\" a Polish diplomat said.\n\nBut a fourth EU diplomat said it wasn't so surprising, given Ireland's record of \"maximalist\" positions on human-rights issues.\n\nThe Irish-backed proposals say Russian lenders Gazprombank, Alfa Bank, Rosbank, and Tinkoff Bank should be cut off from the 'Swift' international payments grid.\n\nA Gazprombank ban would have far-reaching consequences because it handles payments for Russian gas exports.\n\n\"It shall be prohibited to purchase, import, or transfer, directly or indirectly, diamonds ... if they originate in Russia and if they have been exported from Russia into the [European] Union or to any third country,\" the group also proposed to add to the EU's sanctions regime. Russian diamond exports are worth €4bn a year.\n\nThey called for a \"ban on cooperating with Russia on nuclear energy\", on the transfer of EU or US cash banknotes to Russia, and on sales of real estate to Russians.\n\nIn the services sector, the EU should impose a \"ban on using Kaspersky Lab [a Russian cybersecurity giant] technology\" inside Europe and stop EU firms from doing IT work for Russian clients, the group said.\n\nOn the counter-propaganda front, they proposed taking three Russian TV broadcasters (NTV Mir, REN TV, and Rossija 1), as well as six online ones (NewsFront, SouthFront, Katehon, Strategic Culture Foundation, Fondsk, and InfoRos), off the airwaves.\n\nThey also wanted an explicit ban on Russian funding for EU-registered lobbying firms, NGOs, and think-thanks.\n\nThey said people who help Russia to circumvent sanctions should themselves be put on EU visa-ban and asset-freeze blacklists.\n\nAnd they listed dozens of high-tech products that should no longer be exported to the EU's war-mongering neighbour, including smartphones, radar equipment, and laser appliances.\n\nArt of the possible\n\nThe proposals come as Russia-occupied regions in eastern Ukraine begin fake referendums on independence, leading to Russian annexation as early as next week.\n\nAll 27 EU countries are to hold talks with the EU Commission over the weekend on the feasibility of sanctions ideas.\n\n\"The Commission has carried out consultations with national capitals, so it's in the best position to know what would be acceptable to everyone,\" another EU diplomat said.\n\nThe minimum the EU will do is blacklist officials involved in the bogus referendums, list a few minor Russian banks, and ban some high-tech products, diplomats predicted.\n\nThey will also try to stop firms shipping Russian oil sold at inflated prices, for instance by invalidating insurance coverage for tankers involved in the trade.\n\nThe eighth round of sanctions comes after the EU already listed 1,206 Russians and struck out at most sectors of the Russian economy, leaving few big targets left.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Poland and the Baltic States make headway with Irish support.\n\nRussia-friendly Hungary has in the past vetoed blacklistings and is up to its neck in nuclear cooperation with Russian firm Rosatom, which is building two reactors at Hungary's Paks atomic plant.\n\nFrance, Germany, and Italy, as well as smaller countries, such as Austria, Cyprus, and Greece, are also more dovish than Poland and the Baltic states.\n\nAnd some EU sources saw the Irish-Polish-Baltic paper as more of a roadmap for action further down the line, than as a list of demands to be implemented in reaction to the annexations.\n\n\"It's more of a reflection paper, showing the direction of travel,\" an EU contact said.",
    "David McWilliams: The ‘Ireland is crap’ brigade are way off mark but we need to sort the housing crisis": "The evidence you are about to read serves to reinforce the need to fix Ireland’s housing crisis, which, on a daily basis, undermines the achievements of our economy. Photograph: Bryan O Brien\n\nNothing invites criticism quite like a column from an economist producing evidence, via facts and data, indicating that Ireland is not such a bad place. Critics on the hand-wringing left argue that Ireland is a neoliberal, fat-cat kleptocracy, while critics on the nativist right warn of a multicultural powder keg.\n\nBoth extremes have specific and legitimate grievances that represent real voter concern but the general picture in Ireland is far removed from the dystopia of the right and the left. The “Ireland is crap” brigade are way off the mark: Ireland is among the least unequal countries in the world, while the Irish tax and welfare systems, far from bolstering inequality, work the hardest in the world to redistribute income from the richest earners to the poorest.\n\nBefore taxes and transfers, Ireland is the 33rd most unequal country in the world, in a ranking where 35th is the worst position and first the best. After taxes and social welfare, Ireland is the 13th, moving in line with other European countries. The poorest people in Ireland, the 5 per cent at the bottom, are 63 per cent richer than the poorest people in the UK.\n\nThe evidence you are about to read serves to reinforce the need to fix Ireland’s housing crisis, which undermines the achievements of our economy and besmirches our society. If we fix housing, we fix almost everything, as most of the other heavy lifting has been accomplished.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nThe Financial Times’ economics journalist John Burn-Murdoch is incredibly skilled at explaining dense data in a visual and comprehensible way. He wrote a column last week about the levels of income inequality in the UK and the United States, concluding that the two countries displayed levels of inequality far exceeding those in other well-off countries.\n\nThis description chimed with my own experience in the UK. A few years back, having accompanied an under-13s football team (Cabinteely Boys) on a trip to Birmingham, I remember being taken aback by the poverty. Watching schoolboy football takes you all over Dublin — you get to see it all, including Cherry Orchard, incidentally, one of the great Irish schoolboy football clubs. Nothing compares to the urban poverty on view in Stechford, east Birmingham.\n\nLooking at the very richest first, the chart tells us that being in the richest cohort in Ireland, the UK or Norway puts you among the richest people in the world. Graphic: John Burn-Murdoch/@johnburnmurdoch/FinancialTimes\n\nThe Financial Times article trawled the data for disposable income, covering various income groups from the poorest to the richest people in a variety of countries. It found that the gaps between the richest and poorest were most stark in the UK and the US, which is not so surprising. Much of the economic and social policy pursued by both countries was designed to engineer such an outcome. Fascinated by such a comprehensive investigation, I asked Burn-Murdoch to send me the Irish data. The result is the chart above comparing Norway and Switzerland, the two best countries in which to be born either rich or poor, with the UK, US and Ireland, showing progress since 2005.\n\n[ French embassy issues warning over ‘severe housing crisis’ in Ireland ]\n\nThe way to read these charts is from left to right, noting the fifth percentile on the left is the poorest 5 per cent of the population; the 10th percentile is the poorest 10 per cent; the median is the income of the people right in the middle; the 90th percentile is the very wealthy top 10 per cent; and the 97th percentile is the uber-rich top 3 per cent.\n\nLooking at the very richest first, the chart tells us that being in the richest cohort in Ireland, the UK or Norway puts you among the richest people in the world. These are Irish people who take home about €95,000 or more after tax. Only the Swiss rich are much richer. Being in the top 10 highest earners in the country also puts you in the extremely rich global club. As you can see, the American wealthy leave the rest behind. Interestingly, Irish wealthy people are wealthier than their UK counterparts, meaning they have more disposable income.\n\nSocially, Ireland left the UK behind a long time ago. And although it seems natural to benchmark ourselves against our neighbours, such comparisons flatter to deceive\n\nSo far, so plutocratic. In terms of exposing myths and shibboleths, things get more interesting as we move towards the average. The people right in the middle in Ireland have 20 per cent more income, after tax, than the people in the middle in the UK, while the people in the middle in Norway, Switzerland and the US are richer. If you are in the middle in Ireland, your standard of living is about the same as the middle in most developed countries.\n\nAs we can see from the data, the poorest 10 per cent in Ireland rank well above the developed-world average and some 45 per cent above their counterparts in the UK, while the bottom 5 per cent of Irish earners have a standard of living which is 63 per cent higher than the poorest people in the UK.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, the gap between the richest earners and the poorest is about three times, the richest taking home about three times more than the poorest. In Ireland, the richest 10 per cent take home a little bit more than three times the poorest, as is the case in Norway. In the UK, however, the richest 10 per cent take home closer to six times the poorest. This gap, more than anything else, explains the fractious, divided nature of UK politics, where regional and social deprivation pushes people to extremes. Underneath all that pomp this week lies a very unequal country.\n\n[ The Irish Times view on the student housing crisis: a test the State has failed ]\n\nSocially, Ireland left the UK behind a long time ago. And although it seems natural to benchmark ourselves against our neighbours, such comparisons flatter to deceive; we should compare ourselves with other developed social democratic countries in the European Union. However, this UK and international data will be interesting for the coming debate on a united Ireland. As Northern Ireland is among the poorest region in an already poor UK, one shudders to think what the comparators might reveal.\n\nAs is always the case with statistics, the old expression “every statistic has an agenda” should be kept in mind. Quite apart from disposable income survey data, which is the standardised way of measuring international living standards, there is another series published by the EU called actual individual consumption or AIC. This attempts to measure consumption per head of public and private goods. On this measure, Ireland comes out below the EU average and is used by others to argue that the country is poorer than the disposable income data indicates. However, AIC is an average figure, meaning you add up everything and divide it by the number of people to get a per-capita figure.\n\nThis approach masks a problem with averages. For example, say you were drinking with your four friends and those at the table had an average pretax income of €50,000. If Denis O’Brien joined you (worth €3.2 billion, apparently), the average income of the table would go up to €640 million. You get the picture.\n\nAlso, as AIC takes in health provision, Ireland, with not only the youngest population in Europe but also the smallest old population because of outsize emigration until the late 1980s, consumes less healthcare. Furthermore, AIC does not capture the fact that Irish people save a lot more than the rest of the EU — 19.1 per cent compared with 14.5 per cent, meaning a full 4.5 per cent of income is not captured.\n\nThe evidence reveals that Irish standards of living are high relative to the rest of our peers and that levels of income inequality between top earners and bottom earners are far better than the UK and are on par with other EU countries. Our tax and welfare systems are highly progressive. But the big problem is housing. Unless Ireland faces down property interests and builds tens of thousands of homes at every price range, then all the good work will come to nowt.\n\nWhat better incentive can there be to get our houses in order?\n\nRead more from David McWilliams\n\n[ David McWilliams: The property market and its players have changed profoundly since 2008.

    "Ireland ambassador to UK urges negotiations to solve Brexit issues": "(Alliance News) - Ireland's ambassador to the UK has stressed the need to find a negotiated solution to the problems surrounding Northern Ireland's post-Brexit arrangements.\n\nMartin Fraser said he was an optimist about the chances of resolving the issues around the Northern Ireland protocol but the situation was currently in the \"words phase\" and had to move to the \"actions phase\".\n\nThe UK government is legislating to effectively tear up parts of the agreement, which sets out how goods flowing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland are treated.\n\nFraser, speaking at a fringe event at the Labour Party conference in Liverpool, said the protocol was the only way to resolve the problems caused by Brexit.\n\nThe agreement, signed by then prime minister Boris Johnson's government, effectively keeps Northern Ireland aligned with many EU single market rules to avoid a hard border with Ireland, therefore requiring some checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea.\n\nDevolution in the region has been in flux since February when the DUP withdrew its first minister from the governing executive in protest at the economic border created in the Irish Sea by the protocol.\n\nFraser acknowledged there were \"legitimate concerns\" but said: \"How do we solve it? We solve it by negotiating through the issues that are there.\n\n\"From our point of view, from the EU, we solve it by implementing the protocol that was agreed with the British government, which the British government signed and fought an election, passed through Parliament.\n\n\"We think it's the best and only solution. But of course we recognise that people have legitimate issues and we do definitely recognise that the Unionist community in Northern Ireland has legitimate concerns which we have to try and address.\n\n\"But we address them by negotiating.\"\n\nAsked if he was optimistic about the situation, he said: \"I think we have to solve this problem, I think we can, I think we should.\"\n\nHe added: \"I couldn't have worked on Northern Ireland politics for the best part of 20 years without being optimistic and I think we should all be optimistic.\"\n\nsource: PA\n\nCopyright 2022 Alliance News Limited.

    "Different story now for sectarianism and sport in Northern Ireland": "More than 30 years ago the late Colm Keane made a haunting radio documentary for RTÉ called A Belfast Game. It told the story of the Ardoyne Kickhams U-16 footballers, winners of the South Antrim championship in 1969, and how The Troubles invaded their lives. The final was played seven days after James Callaghan, the British home secretary, had moved troops into the North to confront the growing unrest, and on their way to Casement Park the team bus passed burnt out cars, the smouldering remains of the previous night’s rioting.\n\nIt was a still point in lives that would be dragged in different directions. Two members of that panel of 24 players lost their lives in The Troubles; two of them lost fathers; two of them had brothers who were shot. Ten of them emigrated, only a couple of whom returned. Among their ranks, too, were a couple of Protestant boys, which would have been unusual then, and unimaginable only a short time later.\n\nTaking a snapshot of Northern Ireland in The Troubles through the lens of sport was a recurring device, across all media. A few years after Colm Keane’s documentary, Fergal Keane of the BBC made The Boys of Summer for television, telling the story of a football team from Holy Cross primary school, in Ardoyne, and set just a year earlier in 1968.\n\nWhen Andrew Lloyd Webber and Ben Elton had the chutzpah to turn The Troubles into a dismal West End musical, The Beautiful Game was reportedly inspired by both of those documentaries, with at least a couple of the characters transported from The Boys of Summer, and fitted with a costume for the stage.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nIn telling a story from The Troubles, sport offered a universal language. In a divided society, it was an emblem of your tribe, just as visceral as the songs, and the flags, and the faith and the politics. The short hand was simple to decipher.\n\nSo, what does it mean now? Does it mean all the same things it once did? Or have the borders softened?\n\n[ Northern Ireland census: Another psychological blow for unionism ]\n\n[ More Catholics than Protestants in Northern Ireland for first time, census finds ]\n\nWhen the results of the Northern Ireland census were released on Thursday, one of the outcomes that generated the greatest attention was how people described their nationality. On the census form were eight options, descending from the vanilla responses (British only 31.86 per cent; Irish only 29.13 per cent) to a variety of minority identities (British, Irish and Northern Irish only 1.47 per cent; Irish and Northern Irish only 1.76 per cent).\n\nIn an alternative census, how would those numbers have translated into sporting preferences? Would “GAA only” or “Rugby only” or “Soccer only” have dominated the numbers, like they would have done, say, 30 years ago, or would more of the second and third preferences have been cross-cultural?\n\nIn 2015 the Northern Ireland Executive commissioned the University of Ulster to produce a report, Social Exclusion and Sport in Northern Ireland. Some of the outcomes were heartening: 86 per cent of the people surveyed said they believed sport was a good way to break down barriers between Protestants and Catholics, and around the same figure believed that sport was more “open and inclusive” than it had been a decade earlier; two-thirds of respondents said they believed that sports-based peace-building projects were “effective.”\n\nA significant number of Protestants have hinted at an interest in GAA. Photograph: John McVitty/Inpho\n\nIn the next breath, 57 per cent of the people surveyed believed there was “nothing wrong” with different sports for Protestants and Catholics. Only 1 per cent of the Protestants surveyed said they had watched “a lot” of Gaelic football in the previous year, but nearly two in five said they would go to a game in Casement Park, if they were given a ticket. Even though the free ticket was a hypothetical offer, it represented a degree of curiosity, and minds that were at least ajar.\n\nSearching for what those numbers might mean in the day-to-day life of the mainstream sports requires some rooting around. Ten years ago, for example, when Ulster reached the final of the Heineken Cup against Leinster, they profiled their support base and established that nearly a quarter of their regulars at Ravenhill were from a nationalist background. It is hard imagine that figure has fallen since.\n\nIn recent years, Windsor Park has become a more comfortable environment for Catholics who wish to support Northern Ireland: there are more green and white flags and fewer union jacks, and the song-list in the stands is not as inflammatory as it once was. Are there more football fans who support both Northern Ireland and the Republic now? That would be an interesting question for the alternative census.\n\nThe GAA are attempting to reach out, too. One terrific initiative is the Cúchulainn Cup, which this year included 14 schools in five towns: five Catholic schools, five Protestant schools, and four schools that cater for children of all religions. In each town a multi-denominational team is picked, mostly with beginners, or kids who used to play but haven’t done so for years. This year’s winners were Limavady, with a team picked from two Protestant schools and one Catholic school.\n\nTargeting children as carriers of change is the mission of Peaceplayers, an international organisation, which has been active in Northern Ireland since the early 2000s. “It is based on a very simple premise,” said Gareth Harper, managing director of their Belfast office. “Children who play together can learn to live together.”\n\nTheir work is primarily conducted in schools that are partnered for the purpose of forming integrated basketball teams, a neutral sport not associated with one tradition or the other. One of their initiatives is the Belfast Inter-Face Games where they work with children near the so-called peace lines - segregation walls between loyalist and republican areas that were erected during The Troubles.\n\nOne of their greatest triumphs was in Ardoyne. In the early 2000s, Holy Cross, a Catholic primary school in a Protestant area, was picketed by local parents who claimed that their homes had been attacked by republicans. The protests turned violent and eventually riot police accompanied the Holy Cross pupils and their parents on their daily walk to school.\n\nPeaceplayers worked with Holy Cross and a nearby Protestant school in Wheatfield to build an integrated basketball team and, from that, a bridge. Having had the experience of playing basketball together, they got involved in a Game of Three Halves (a joint Ulster GAA, Ulster Rugby and IFA project) where Protestant kids from Wheatfield and Glenbryn played Gaelic football and Catholic kids from Holy Cross played rugby.\n\nIt is the same neighbourhood where Colm Keane and Fergal Keane told their stories. But it is a different story now.",
    "Coming of age as a poet: Tim Atkinson on Ireland’s other Larkin": "Philip Larkin: spent five vital years in Ireland in the 1950s, enjoying what he described as “The best writing conditions I ever had.” Photograph: Barry Wilkinson/Getty Images\n\nBig Jim might be better known (with good reason) but his English namesake Philip Larkin spent five vital years in Ireland in the 1950s, coming of age as a poet and enjoying what he described as “The best writing conditions I ever had.” Who knows how much larger his poetic legacy might have been had he enjoyed those conditions longer?\n\nBorn on August 9th, 1932, the lugubrious librarian and poet of provincial England fell under the spell of William Butler Yeats as a young man. That wasn’t to last; but Larkin’s fondness for Ireland was. He was sub-librarian at Queen’s University from 1950-1955. The man who became (unfairly) branded “the hermit of Hull” was anything but in Belfast. In charge of the issue-desk by day, he then “wrote between eight and ten in the evenings” in his high-windowed attic rooms in Elmwood Avenue before meeting colleagues in the SCR bar. After closing time he then “played cards or talked with friends until one or two.”\n\nAmbitious, both in his professional and literary careers, he moved back to England to take up the post of university librarian at Hull, remaining there for the rest of his life. But Ireland was always more than a memory. Two years after leaving he was back in Belfast as best man at his friend Alec Dalgarno’s wedding at St George’s Church in the centre of the city. At first amused to discover that the officiating priest was called St John Puke, Larkin was later alarmed by the cleric’s lack of self-control at the wedding reception. The priest insisted on loudly proclaiming “a stream of sentimental verbiage so nauseating as to be laughable,” Larkin confided to a friend. “At times I wondered if as best man I ought to knock him out, but he had apparently played rugger for Ireland in his day and was built on the general lines of Spencer Tracy and Tom Teevan (both of whom he strongly resembled) so I decided against doing so, perhaps wisely.”\n\nIn 1969 Queen’s awarded Larkin an honorary D Litt, and though he stayed in Belfast for just one night in July, he and his partner Monica Jones returned later that summer for one of their longest holidays, staying with friends at Westport in Co Mayo and paying a visit to the capital that was to inspire the poem Dublinesque just a year later. Describing a funeral procession, the poem ends with the half-heard name of the deceased, as sung by the mourners, as well as with one of the most succinct, emotional punch-lines imaginable:\n\nREAD MORE\n\nA voice is heard singing\n\nOf Kitty, or Katy\n\nAs if the name meant once\n\nAll love, all beauty.\n\nLate Larkin was very pro-Thatcher and anti-trade unions (which would have enraged Jim). Because of this, Jonathan Raban once described the Belfast Larkin as a Loyalist. But his attitude to the Orange marches he witnessed was nothing if not nuanced and a short, unpublished poem referring to Ian Paisley as the “Pope” of Ulster seems to be less than supportive of July 12th bonfires and marches:\n\nSee the Pope of Ulster stand,\n\nSpiked shillelagh in each hand,\n\nVowing to uphold the Border,\n\nFather, Son and Orange Order.\n\nThat may be doggerel, but what Larkin was writing in the Belfast years was the poetry that was to make his name. It marked the end of a period of doubt and inactivity. “After finishing my first books,” he writes, “I thought I had come to an end. I couldn’t write another novel, I published nothing . . . Then in 1950 I went to Belfast, and things reawoke somehow. I wrote some poems,” he remarks, modestly, and “felt for the first time I was speaking for myself. Thoughts, feelings, language cohered and jumped.”\n\nThose thoughts and feelings, that language, jumped to form The Less Deceived, Larkin’s second collection but the first to receive widespread acclaim. Although published in Hull by the Marvell Press, many of the poems had their genesis in Ireland. Some were written directly in response to experiences in Belfast. Church Going, for example, was inspired in part by a visit to a ruined church outside the city:\n\nA serious house on serious earth it is,\n\nIn whose blent air all our compulsions meet,\n\nAre recognised, and robed as destinies.\n\nAnd that much never can be obsolete,\n\nSince someone will forever be surprising\n\nA hunger in himself to be more serious,\n\nAnd gravitating with it to this ground,\n\nWhich, he once heard, was proper to grow wise in,\n\nIf only that so many dead lie round.\n\n“One cannot overstate the effect that the move to Belfast had on his work,” writes Richard Bradford in his book The Importance of Elsewhere – “it wrought the transformation of Larkin from frustrated novelist to the finest English poet of the late twentieth century.”",

    "Cost of living: More than a million people in Ireland struggling to make ends meet": "The cost-of-living crisis is being felt by almost everyone and public sentiment is, as a result, highly pessimistic, the new poll finds\n\nWorry is general all over Ireland.\n\nThose with children are more worried than those without. People living outside Dublin are more anxious than those in the capital. The young and the middle-aged are feeling more vulnerable than the old.

People are turning to lenders, credit cards, families and friends for a dig-out.\n\nIf an unexpected expense of €1,000 befell someone today — a medical emergency, say, a family crisis or a problem with the car — it could not be paid for by two in five people.\n\nAs we emerge from the worst constraints of the pandemic, yet another “new normal” has been foisted upon us: One of military invasion in Ukraine, with Russia’s tactical assault leading to a proxy energy war elsewhere.\n\nThe B&A poll is, of course, only a snapshot of Ireland’s mood and people’s behaviour in a five-day period during September 2022.\n\nBut it does bear out some of the warnings of campaigners, student leaders, trade unions and Opposition parties, among 30 organisations in the Cost of Living Coalition behind today’s demonstration who say people should not be forced to make a decision on whether to eat or heat.\n\n‘Failing state’\n\nOne of those organisers, Fr Peter McVerry, this week went as far as to describe Ireland as a “failing state” denying people access to housing, free education, public healthcare and mental healthcare.\n\n“It’s the responsibility of the Government to meet the basic needs of its citizens,” he said, firing a broadside at ministers who, he said, champion our “extraordinarily successful” economy “in one of the highest cost-of-living countries”.\n\nWhy, he wondered, would any young person want to stay here. Many are not planning to, answered Beth Reilly, president of the Union of Students in Ireland (USI). Students living in tents and cars and sleeping on couches over a lack of affordable accommodation are preparing for an exodus from the country, she warned.\n\n'It’s the responsibility of the Government to meet the basic needs of its citizens,' said Peter McVerry. Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill\n\n“We shouldn’t have to leave to afford to live,” she said. “But that is the Ireland we are looking at currently.”\n\nMacdara Doyle, of trade union umbrella organisation Congress, urged radical measures to “prevent an energy crisis morphing into what could become a jobs crisis and a wider economic crisis”.\n\nThe B&A poll underlines that portent of a deepening chill on the wider economy. Many have already taken steps and are planning to take more to spend less over the coming months — on everything from takeaway coffees to Netflix subscriptions.\n\nSentiment, as economists call it, is pessimistic across all demographics. Whether young or old, male or female, “white collar” or “blue collar”, a parent or not, whether living in Rathmines in Dublin, Rathmullan in Co Donegal or Rathcormac in Co Cork, almost half of people living in Ireland have indicated they see no end in sight to current hardships.\n\nLuke Reaper, managing director of B&A, describes the current cost-of-living crisis as “uncharted territory” which “feels very different to the last recession/financial crash of 2008/2009”.\n\n“People are not familiar with this playbook. In a classic recession, the narrative is clear. Jobs are lost, but things get better as jobs return. What will coming out of this crisis look like? The truth is, people don’t have a clue,” he says.\n\n‘Mental block’\n\n“When it comes to energy, some people’s heads are firmly in the sand. There’s a significant mental block in acknowledging the impact this is going to make. People are struggling to understand how to pay up to four times what they are used to for electricity, on top of everything else.\n\n“So people are using classic avoidance tactics. It’s too much for most of us to cognitively take on — we’re pinning all hopes on Government intervention to take the bite out of it. If that doesn’t materialise to a significant degree, most people don’t have a plan B.”\n\n“Undoubtedly people in general are worried”, Reaper adds, with almost everyone, but particularly those with the least disposable income, “putting everything under the microscope”.\n\n“We witnessed an amount of behavioural change during the Covid pandemic, and we are seeing it again,” he says.\n\n[ Budget 2023: What are Irish households looking for? ]\n\nWith Budget 2023 due to be announced on Tuesday, Government Buildings will be the scene of long, late-night meetings in the coming days as the Coalition puts the finishing touches to a budget, the likes of which has perhaps not been so anticipated by so many for decades.\n\n“The reassurance from the budget cannot come fast enough, with people fearful for the winter and, indeed, the cost of Christmas,” Reaper says.\n\n“The current crisis requires both a functional and emotional response. Functionally, prices are up and hurting people and hopefully the budget will help at least in part, but we also need emotional supports to lead us get through to the other side.\n\n“The psychological battle needs to be won to avoid talking the economy down, which will worsen the situation further.”\n\n‘Struggling’\n\nThe B&A survey was carried out between September 8th and 12th. The 1,005 respondents aged 16 and over are, the pollsters say, a “nationally representative sample” of the population, selected to reflect gender, age, socioeconomic and regional diversity.\n\nTwo focus groups were also held in Dublin and Cork with a mix of blue-collar and white-collar workers between September 20th-21st to underpin the results.\n\nB&A found a 73 per cent rise since January, when a similar survey was carried out, in the number of households in Ireland saying they are “struggling” to meet their bills, up to 26 per cent of homes around the country from 15 per cent over just eight months.\n\nAmong the section of the population who say they are struggling to make ends meet, almost two-thirds (62%) are aged 25-49\n\nThose who said they were “living comfortably” was down to 16 per cent from 25 per cent over the same period, while there was also a slight dip in people who said they were “getting by financially” from 60 per cent to 58 per cent.\n\nAmong the section of the population who say they are struggling to make ends meet, almost two thirds (62 per cent) are aged between 25 and 49. Those in their late 20s and early 30s make up the sharpest rise in financial suffering since January.\n\nMore than one third (34 per cent) are aged between 50 and 64.\n\nThe findings suggest — and this is borne out over a number of metrics in the poll — that people aged 65 and over are the most financially secure of all people living in Ireland. They now account for 11 per cent of those struggling, and this group showed the lowest rise (four percentage points, compared to a 19 percentage point surge of those aged between 25 and 34).\n\nPensioners were also the most likely to say they were living in financial comfort (31 per cent), in sharp contrast to those aged 25 to 34 (9 per cent), those aged 35 to 49 (10 per cent), and those aged 50 to 64 (11 per cent).\n\n[ Cliff Taylor: High-price pain for households will linger even when inflation eventually eases ]\n\nStarkest differences\n\nOne of the starkest differences is the gap between blue-collar and white-collar workers. Those described as professionals made up 15 per cent of those who said they were struggling financially, an increase of six percentage points since January.\n\nBut those described as non-professionals account for 38 per cent of those who say they are struggling and represents a 17 percentage point jump.\n\nWhen it comes to geographical location, those based in Dublin fare best — or least worst — when it comes to making ends meet. Those living in the capital make up 18 per cent of those at the sharpest end of the crisis, up five percentage points since January. Compare that to 29 per cent living outside the capital — a hike of 12 percentage points.\n\nFamilies in Leinster (31 per cent, up 16 percentage points) are worst impacted, followed by Munster (29 per cent, up 11) and Connacht and Ulster (28 per cent, up 11).\n\nThroughout society, there has been a ‘significant decrease in the perception of having disposable income’\n\nPeople with children are struggling more than those without, the survey found. Parents and guardians make up 33 per cent of those who say they are struggling, compared with 23 per cent of those without children. Women (30 per cent) are also more likely than men (22 per cent) to be in financial difficulty.\n\nThroughout society, there has been a “significant decrease in the perception of having disposable income”, the pollsters found.\n\nBelts have been tightening steadily since before the pandemic. Weeks before the first lockdown in early 2020, less than a quarter (23 per cent) felt less well off compared to the previous year. That climbed to 34 per cent in May 2021, to 47 per cent in January this year and rose again to 79 per cent this month.\n\nAgain, those living outside the capital are feeling the pinch most — 82 per cent, compared to 72 per cent of those in Dublin. The gap is slightly less between parents (83 per cent) and those without children (77 per cent), but still significant.\n\nSpare cash\n\nJust 7 per cent reported having more spare cash in recent weeks, the figure plunging from 26 per cent in May of last year when there was a spike in savings as businesses shuttered to curb the spread of Covid-19.\n\nThose in Dublin were more likely to report having more or the same amount of money in their pockets compared to those outside the capital.\n\nAsked if they could afford to pay an unexpected expense of €1,000 right now, two in five said it was out of the question. That is 1.5 million people.\n\nWomen (49 per cent) were much more likely to answer no compared to men (29 per cent). More than half of parents (51 per cent) do not have the money for an unforeseen expense, compared to 34 per cent of those without children.\n\nWell over half (54 per cent) of blue-collar workers could not afford it, against a quarter of professionals.\n\n[ Here’s how much it costs to take a shower or make a cup of tea ]\n\nWhile around one fifth of those aged 65 and older said they could not meet such an expense, the proportion rises sharply to around half of those aged 25 to 49, and 44 per cent of those aged 50 to 64.\n\nAgain, those in Dublin are better protected against financial shocks, with 34 per cent saying they could not meet a sudden demand for payment, compared to 41 per cent outside the capital.\n\nA quarter of people have already dipped into savings over the past month to pay bills. More than two in five (43 per cent) say they do not have the money to save as they used to.\n\nSome 11 per cent are leaning on credit cards, overdrafts and other means of borrowing, but that number surges to 17 per cent among people with children.\n\nPessimism soaring\n\nIt is little surprise, then, that nine in 10 are gloomy about the economic outlook over the coming year, the rate of pessimism soaring from 30 per cent before the pandemic to 89 per cent this month.\n\nAll of this does not bode well for businesses and traders. Almost half of people are spending less on essentials such as food, while three-quarters have pulled in the purse strings when it comes to “non-essential” shopping.\n\nIn the past month, six in 10 have cut back on eating out, buying clothes, meeting up with friends at the pub or going to the cinema or a concert. More than half (54 cent) have stopped buying takeaway cappuccinos and lattes, while 45 per cent say they are cutting down on drinking alcohol at home.\n\nA similar number (44 per cent) are eliminating hairdressing appointments, while more than half (52 per cent) are holding off on home decor spending. A quarter say they are cancelling gym memberships, with a similar number pressing pause on streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon.\n\nMany are turning to discount retailers to make ends meet, as well as, in some cases, food banks. Around 3 per cent of the population relied on a food parcel over the last month. The youngest (those aged 16 to 24) are twice as likely to turn to charity as other age groups. Again, those aged 65 and over are least represented in the food-bank figures, while parents are over-represented.",
    "North and west of Ireland downgraded to ‘lagging region’ by EU": "The north and west of Ireland has been downgraded to a “lagging region” by the European Commission.\n\nThe Sunday Business Post has revealed that development challenges have affected the GDP per head of population in the region, leading to its fall in the rankings.\n\nThe region, which covers Mayo, Galway, Roscommon, Leitrim, Sligo, Donegal and Monaghan, is now the only region marked as ‘lagging’ after dropping from ‘more developed’ status to a ‘transition region’.\n\nThe GDP per head of population in the region is now an estimated 71 per cent of the EU average.\n\nThe report found that weaknesses in the region centred around lower productivity and educational attainment, as well as a weaker skills base and business environment.\n\nThe north and west is now ranked the 177th most competitive region out of a total of 240 in the EU.",
    "All-Ireland semi 'doesn't come up' between Oz teammates": "It's only 13 months since Vikki Wall and Erika O'Shea clashed in an All-Ireland semi-final for the ages, Wall and Meath memorably coming out on top.\n\nNow the Meath and Cork duo share the same AFLW dream as North Melbourne teammates and are even housemates.\n\n\"That doesn't come up too much,\" smiled back-to-back All-Ireland winner Wall of the 2021 semi-final which Meath eventually won after extra-time. \"A few of the girls out here were questioning whether we'd played together or against each other back home so there were a few brief conversations about that within the North Melbourne setup alright! But no, we haven't talked about it too much.\"\n\nSo far in season seven of the oval ball game, the Irish pair have played all five matches for their club, winning three and losing two. The losses were to Melbourne and Adelaide, both of whom featured in last season's grand final, and there are five regular round games to go. The Kangaroos are currently seventh in the table. A top eight finish in late October will yield qualification for the knock-out stages.\n\nWhatever about reigning Player of the Year Wall adapting quickly to the game, O'Shea's development is even more impressive having just turned 20.\n\n\"From a personal perspective I'm glad I waited until I'm this age,\" said Wall. \"I'm 24 now so I'm probably at a stage where I feel more confident coming over here. I don't know how I would have fared at a younger age. Erika is taking it in her stride and it's great to see. I think it's a big move no matter what age you are so it definitely takes a bit of time to adjust.\"\n\nWhen, or even if, either of them will play for their counties again remains to be seen.\n\nBoth were All-Stars in 2021 and while O'Shea missed Cork's 2022 campaign, the likelihood is that Wall will be honoured again after another excellent season.\n\nMeath, currently without a management team, would love to have her back for the defence of their National League and All-Ireland titles in 2023. That seems unlikely though with all the indicators that the AFLW season will start again in late summer.\n\n\"No plans at the moment,\" said Wall of 2023. \"It's a bit of a waiting game which, in some ways, is kind of maybe prolonging it and things like that but in other ways it's nice to forget about it for a little while and just give my full devotion to what I'm doing at the moment. It (next year's AFLW season) will be a similar timeframe. It could be May it will start in, as in pre-season, if they introduce more games so we'll see.\"\n\nWall was happy to hear that former President Mary McAleese will chair an integration process between the GAA, Camogie and LGFA organisations.\n\n\"When you have someone with such experience as Mary McAleese, I don't think you're ever not going to be going in the right direction. It's all definitely on an upward trajectory. It's a really exciting time for the game back home to see that progress being made.\"\n\n* Vikki Wall was speaking at the launch of the next phase of the National Dairy Council's 'From the Ground Up' campaign. The campaign highlights the hard work and commitment shared by top athletes and dairy farmers and includes a new TV and cinema campaign.",
    "Northern Ireland Under-21s boss John Schofield praises forwards’ work ethic as they battle to draw against Scotland": "Northern Ireland Under-21s manager John Schofield praised his forwards’ work ethic as they battled back to earn a 1-1 draw in their second friendly against Scotland in Paisley on Sunday.\n\nNottingham Forest striker Dale Taylor fired home in the 18th minute at SMiSA Stadium to cancel out Flynn Clarke’s opener for the hosts as the two sides could not be separated.\n\nAfter a 3-1 defeat in the first of their two friendlies in Belfast on Thursday, Schofield was delighted to see his team improve for the second of the double-header, in particular his forward corps.\n\nAlongside Taylor, Linfield prospect Chris McKee had two strong games, while Charlton Athletic hitman Euan Williams also showed up well across the friendlies.\n\n\"There’s been a lot of work not just for Dale but all the front lads,” explained Schofield, speaking to the Northern Ireland official Twitter account.\n\n\"We want to stretch teams in behind so they have to make a lot of runs that possibly don’t get noticed because the ball doesn’t go in behind. It’s not a case of they only run when the ball’s gone, they’ve made a lot of runs before that.\n\n\"Dale took his goal well, had a couple other chances – probably better chances – he could have finished. They want to be judged on goals, but the work ethic of the side was really good and they showed a really good understanding of what we want to do with them.”\n\nNorthern Ireland are now building towards their qualifying campaign for the 2025 European Championships, which is set to get under way in a year’s time, and Schofield admits they used these two games to experiment.\n\nBut the manager was encouraged by what he saw, not least the buy-in from his players as they look to continue growing as a squad ahead of their bid to reach their first major tournament finals.\n\n\"I thought we coped with their shape, we adapted to a new shape we were trying. The two games have been a really good exercise because we got to experiment with a couple of formations,” he added.\n\n\"We created a lot of chances. Really happy with the lads’ effort and application, it’s been fantastic, but I would never question that anyway.”"
