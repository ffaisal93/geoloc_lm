    "Portugal's mysterious 'birthing stones'": "The wind whipped across my face as I stood on the edge of a vast plateau in remote northern Portugal. Lavender-blue haze stretched across the horizon, and I could just make out the outline of a steep waterfall as it cascaded down the mountain below. Delicate yellow flowers created swathes of colour in the otherwise murky landscape. Looking down on the mountains spread out before me like an undulating carpet, I felt as if I was standing at the edge of the world, and I could see why these were called the Montanhas Mágicas (Magic Mountains).\n\nI was in the Arouca Unesco Global Geopark, an open-air geological museum that has long been an attraction for the scientific community due to the sheer number of geological marvels it contains: 41 separate geosites in total. These include some of the world's biggest trilobite fossils – arthropods that lived more than 500 million years ago – as well as geological fault lines and otherworldly rock formations sculpted by water over millions of years.\n\nBut I had not come to see any of these – admittedly interesting – natural exhibits. I had come for something even more fascinating: one of the world's most baffling geological phenomena.\n\nPulling myself away from the mountain view, I continued towards my destination: the tiny village of Castanheira. Nestled into the side of the Freita Mountain (one of the Magic Mountains located within the geopark), the village is home to the Pedras Parideiras, or \"Birthing Stones\" in English – 300-million-year-old rocks that seem to \"give birth\" to smaller \"baby\" stones. They are unlike any other rock on the planet.",

(AP Photo/Luca Bruno, File)\n\nMADRID (AP) — Coach Luis Enrique tried to stay optimistic about Spain’s chances of advancing in the Nations League following a disappointing home loss to Switzerland.\n\nAfter all, La Roja can still secure a spot in the Final Four with a win in Portugal on Tuesday.\n\n“It’s a final and we will go there to try to win it,” Luis Enrique said after the 2-1 loss to Switzerland at the weekend, which dropped Spain from first to second in Group A2 ahead of the decisive match in Braga.\n\nBut beating Portugal isn’t something Spain has been able to do recently. The Iberian neighbors have drawn their last four matches, and Spain has not won at Portugal in nearly two decades.\n\nIts last victory against Portugal came in a penalty shootout in the semifinals of the 2012 European Championship, and before that it won in the round of 16 of the 2010 World Cup in a match where Portugal complained of an offside on David Villa’s winning goal in the second half.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPlaying in Portugal, Spain is winless since a 3-0 victory in a friendly in 2003, when Fernando Torres made his national team debut with Spain, and not long after Cristiano Ronaldo began playing for Portugal.\n\nThe teams have drawn four straight since coach Fernando Santos took over Portugal after the 2014 World Cup.\n\nSpain needs the victory after seeing its 22-game unbeaten run at home ended by Switzerland on Saturday. Portugal won 4-0 at the Czech Republic to take first place and earn a chance to advance with a draw on Tuesday.\n\n“Our goal would be the same even if Spain hadn’t lost, we will try to win the match in Braga,” said Portugal defender Diogo Dalot, who scored twice against the Czech Republic. “It’s going to be a complicated match but we will do out best to make it to the next round.”\n\nOnly the group winners advance to the Final Four, which will be played next June. Portugal has 10 points, two more than Spain. Switzerland has six points, two more than the Czech Republic ahead of their match in Switzerland to try to avoid relegation.\n\nSpain is looking for its second consecutive appearance in the Final Four after finishing runner-up to France last year. At that time, it also needed a last-day victory to advance to the Final Four, and it did it by shocking Germany 6-0 at home.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLuis Enrique said he didn’t expect many changes in the squad for the match against Portugal despite the loss on Saturday, though he admitted the team had to improve its defending of set pieces, which is how Switzerland scored both of its goals.\n\nPortugal, the winner of the inaugural edition of the Nations League in 2019, may see the return of forward João Félix, who was not available for the match against the Czech Republic because of an injury. He rejoined his teammates in training on Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nTales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni",

Links to external websites do not constitute an endorsement.\n\nThere’s a reason that a lot of people are moving to Portugal, or talking about moving here, and that’s because there are some many pros to living here. Yes, there are downsides to deal with, like bureaucracy and colder houses, but for the vast majority of people who move to Portugal, the pros outweigh the cons significantly.\n\nFantastic Weather\n\nFirst off, the weather. Portugal has fantastic weather, but the best thing about Portugal’s weather is the mild winters the south gets or the year-round mild weather that Madeira benefits from. Live in the Algarve and you could be eating Christmas dinner outside in 20°C weather while the rest of Europe is under a snowstorm. Lisbon isn’t quite as warm, but it enjoys some of the mildest winters of any European capital city.\n\nThere are a few caveats to understand about the weather, however. Firstly, Portugal doesn’t really have one climate but many. While people in the south of Portugal might be basking in the sun during winter, people in the north might be experiencing a damp, grey winter that’s similar to that found in Northern Europe. Also, regardless of where you are in the country, it’s quite possible that your property isn’t insulated which means that even if it’s warm outside, the property could be cold inside.\n\nWish moving to Portugal was a little more simple? Now it can be. Get the book Moving to Portugal Made Simple from Amazon.\n\nSummers can be hot too, especially if you live inland in somewhere like the Alentejo. But the incredibly hot weather usually only lasts a few months and there are plenty of things that you can do to keep cool (even if you don’t have air con).\n\nA Feeling of Safety\n\nThere’s some debate as to how accurate the oft-quoted statistic of Portugal being the third safest country in the world is, but the reality is Portugal feels incredibly safe – especially when compared to the US, Latin America, and parts of the UK. It’s somewhere where children, the elderly, and women typically feel comfortable walking alone, even late at night.\n\nIn fact, Portuguese culture is incredibly family-friendly: children are adored and the elderly are treated with respect.\n\nHigh Speed Internet\n\nIf you plan on working from home in Portugal (or gaming or keeping in touch with friends over Zoom and WhatsApp), the good news is that it’s possible to get high-speed internet in Portugal.\n\nThat said, you should check what internet options are available before buying or renting a property. It’s not unusual for fibre internet to be available in a town or city, but to not be available just a few kilometres outside, leaving rural residents to rely on mobile and satellite internet. Online internet checkers that just use your postal code are often incorrect so don’t rely on them: use our human-powered internet options checker instead.\n\nLower Cost of living\n\nThis is a slightly trickier one, but for the most part, Portugal has a lower cost of living. Of course, it depends on where you’re coming from and what you’re buying. If you’re moving from New York or San Francisco to Portugal, you’ll notice a considerably lower cost of living. However, if you’re moving from the North of England or Spain, you won’t see a major difference and you might think Portugal is more expensive.\n\nPortugal is cheap for some things and expensive for others. It’s cheap for eating out, for example, where a meal in a three-course lunch menu can cost you less than €10. However, other things like cars, utilities, and fuel are typically more expensive.\n\nAgain, it depends where you’re coming from. Americans typically find groceries and cell phone plans considerably cheaper than the US while many Europeans don’t notice a difference or find them more expensive.\n\nOf course, it’s not just about price but the lifestyle you get for that price. There are few places where you can live close to the beach, enjoy fantastic weather, and eat out regularly for the cost of living that’s found in Portugal.\n\nInviting Beaches\n\nPortuguese beaches, particularly those in the Algarve, have been voted as some of the best in the world. So if your dream is to spend your time soaking up the sunshine and listening to the waves, this is definitely the country for you.\n\nAs well as great beaches, Portugal also has several great surfing hubs such as Sagres, Ericeira, Nazaré, and Costa da Caparica.\n\nIf you’re planning on living inland, you don’t be disappointed either. Whether it’s the Douro, Gerês, Azores, Madeira, or Serra de Arrábida, Portugal has plenty of areas of natural beauty for you to enjoy.\n\nAffordable Healthcare\n\nParticularly for Americans and those outside of Europe, Portugal’s tax-funded healthcare system is a big attraction. There’s no need to worry about having the right insurance when you go to the hospital: access to public healthcare is considered a right.\n\nFor Europeans, Portugal’s healthcare system is less of a novelty and in reality it suffers from many of the same problems as other European countries: emergency healthcare is good, but waiting lists for non-urgent treatment can be long – sometimes more than a year or two.\n\nHowever, one area in which Portugal trumps many other European countries is in the cost of private healthcare. Health insurance and the cost of paying out of pocket are much lower than in many other European countries, and many expats are able to use the private system for the majority of their needs, which often allows them to access better quality healthcare than they would elsewhere.\n\nA large expat community\n\nHaving a large expat community has its downsides – as it means people tend to integrate more into expat communities than local communities – but it’s definitely a pro when you first move. You’ll instantly be able to get to know other people, people in the same boat as you, and it’ll be easy to get answers to questions you have about settling in Portugal.\n\nExcellent level of English\n\nEnglish is widely spoken in Portugal, particularly in the Algarve, Lisbon, Porto, and Madeira. In other parts of Portugal, English is less widely spoken but it still won’t take long to find someone that speaks English.\n\nAlthough your intention might be to learn Portuguese, and to learn it to a fluent level, knowing that other people are likely to speak English is very reassuring – particularly when you’re speaking to a doctor, for example.\n\nHowever, if you want to integrate even a little, you should definitely make an effort to learn Portuguese.\n\nEase of obtaining Portuguese citizenship\n\nAfter living in Portugal for five years, you’ll be able to apply for Portuguese citizenship. This is much faster than in many other European countries. You need to have lived for 10 years in Spain, for example, before you’re able to apply for Spanish citizenship.\n\nFantastic Food & Drink\n\nAt any Portuguese market, you’ll find a great variety of fish and seafood and excellent fruit and vegetables. Most large supermarkets, similarly, will also have a large fish counter. Price-wise fruit and veg is much cheaper than the US, and the quality is better. By European standards, it isn’t particularly cheaper but the quality is better than in many Northern European countries.\n\nEating out in traditional Portuguese restaurants is also extremely affordable, particularly at lunchtime. Here €10-15 can get you a 3-course meal complete with coffee and wine. International restaurants are more expensive and often non-existent in more rural parts of Portugal,\n\nLess variety and imported products are more expensive, but Great fruit and veg at the markets. Lots of great seafood and fish.\n\nPrices are considerably less than they are in the US but similar to other European countries.\n\nLess variety in terms of restaurants, but Portuguese restaurants are affordable. Also where there are foreign restaurants, e.g. Lisbon, great vegan and international restaurants\n\nCompelling Tax Schemes\n\nPortugal isn’t normally known for being a low-tax country, but in some cases it can be preferable to be a tax resident here. The most common is if you stand to benefit from Portugal’s NHR tax regime, which is a special tax regime aimed at newcomers and those returning to Portugal. It is particularly beneficial if you’re a high earner or have a particularly large pension but to be certain that you would benefit from it, you should speak to an accountant.\n\nAnother reason Portugal is considered attractive is its lack of a wealth tax, something which neighbouring Spain has and which can deter high net worth individuals from moving there.\n\nObtainable Residency Visas\n\nIf you don’t have an “EU Passport” and need a visa to move to a European country, Portugal can be very appealing for a number of reasons. Firstly, the visas are considered more attainable than other European countries: the D7, for example, requires you to have a regular income that’s at least more than €705 per month – an achievable amount for many people while the D2, or entrepreneurship visa, doesn’t specify a minimum investment amount.\n\nFor those that have cash to spend, the golden visa can be particularly appealing because it only requires you to spend an average of 7 days per year in Portugal in order to meet your residency requirements.\n\nFor many people, these attainable visas make Portugal a very attractive country as Portugal offers an easy route into Europe.\n\nShare this article\n\n0 shares Share\n\nTweet\n\nPinterest",

    "Plate invites Portugal to support Indonesia become ITU Council member": "We know that Portugal is part of the European Union (EU), (so we have a meeting with Portugal since) we need allies from the members of EU (to support our candidacy).\n\nJakarta (ANTARA) - Communication and Informatics Minister Johnny G. Plate invited the Government of Portugal to support Indonesia to become a member of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Council for the 2023-2026 period, representing the Asia-Pacific region.\"We know that Portugal is part of the European Union (EU), (so we have a meeting with Portugal since) we need allies from the members of EU (to support our candidacy),” the Indonesian minister remarked in a press release on Sunday during Plate's working visit to Portugal.Plate affirmed that his invitation was welcomed by the representative of the Government of Portugal, and there was a high potential for the country to support Indonesia at the ITU Council member election, especially considering the sound relations between both nations.\"Hopefully, they will support us. Considering his gestures and commitments, Minister Mario (Campolargo) highly supports our candidacy,” Plate said after meeting with Portuguese Secretary of State for Digitalization and Modernization of Administration Affairs Mario Campolargo to discuss cooperation potentials in the digital sector.Furthermore, he stated that by becoming the ITU Council member, Indonesia would be able to propose more fair use of telecommunication and information technology, such as the satellite orbit slots and communication device spectrum arrangements, for all countries, including for developed, developing, and least developed nations.Indonesia has pushed for three agendas in its candidacy: capacity building, women's empowerment, as well as connecting the unconnected.In addition to the candidacy as the ITU Council member, Indonesia strives to gather support for the candidacy of an Indonesian telecommunication expert, Meiditomo Sutyarjoko, as a member of the ITU Radio Regulation Board (RRB).Hence, since mid-2022, the Communication and Informatics Ministry had been actively garnering support for the success of the candidacies.Numerous bilateral meetings were conducted with various representatives from several countries, such as Germany, Japan, and Portugal, to bolster international support for Indonesia’s candidacy.The attempt is expected to garner many votes for Indonesia at the ITU Council member election that will be held in coincidence with the implementation of the ITU Plenipotentiary Conference 2022 in Bucharest, Romania, from September 26 to October 14, 2022.",

    "Portugal on a budget – Lonely Planet": "Portugal once had a sterling reputation as one of Europe’s most affordable destinations. Although prices have been on the rise in recent years (thanks in part to the nation’s growing popularity), you can still travel inexpensively here.\n\nMake the most out of every adventure with help from our weekly newsletter delivered to your inbox.\n\nPortugal’s parks and nature reserves are all free to visit, as is the wide array of trails and greenways. Starting the day with a bica (espresso) and a creamy pastel de nata (custard tart) will only set you back a few euros. The country also has many free museums and inexpensive attractions, from medieval architecture to cutting-edge contemporary art. If you’re thrifty, you can get by on as little as 50 euros a day.\n\nHere are some other key ways to cut costs while traveling in Portugal.\n\nFigure out the cheapest way to reach Portugal\n\nPortugal has international airports in Lisbon, Porto and Faro. Be sure to check prices at each before booking, as you may find better deals arriving in one or the other. If you’re considering combining a trip to Portugal with Spain, you might find cheaper rates flying into Madrid or even Sevilla, which is a two-hour train ride away from Tavira in southern Portugal.\n\nTake public transportation from the airport\n\nWhether you arrive in Lisbon, Porto or Faro, you can start your trip right by foregoing a pricey taxi ride and taking a bus or the metro to your destination. Handy metro service runs to city centers from Lisbon (red line) or Porto (violet line E). Faro’s airport has a quality bus service operated by Vamus Algarve. The Aerobus runs into Faro and also to Albufeira, Portimão and Lagos.\n\nInstead of using a rental car, opt to take the train or bus © Andrei Bortnikau / Alamy Stock Photo\n\nDitch the car and get around by train or bus\n\nThe high cost of rental cars coupled with soaring fuel prices can make for a pricey trip to Portugal. You can save money and lower your carbon footprint by traveling the country by train and bus. Portugal’s rail line connects major cities from Valença in the north down to Faro in the south, running through Porto, Coimbra and Lisbon. Portugal’s bus network helps fill in the gaps and connects smaller towns.\n\nTicket prices are reasonable. For instance, the second-class train fare from Lisbon to Lagos (a 4.5-hour journey) is around €25, which is not much more than the price you’d pay on tolls alone by taking the A2 to get there.\n\nVisit from October to April to save on lodging\n\nIn spring and autumn, you’ll generally find pleasant weather in Portugal, with blooming wildflowers in March and April and changing leaves in October in some parts of the country. You’ll also notice thinner crowds and lower rates when it comes to accommodation. Prices are typically around 25% off high season rates.\n\nYou can save even more by visiting from November to February. This is the cheapest time of the year to visit Portugal, and many hotels slash their rates by 50% or more. Just be sure to pack for the weather adequately. Bring a rain jacket, scarf and warm layers for Porto and other destinations in the north. In the south, you’ll still find plenty of sunshine in the Algarve, with mild temperatures for outdoor activities like hiking and biking.\n\nMake lunch your biggest meal\n\nMany restaurants in Portugal offer good-value lunch specials. Always ask if there's a menu do dia (fixed menu) or prato do dia (daily special). Even high-end restaurants typically have lower-priced lunch menus.\n\nIn the evening, you can forego conventional dining for a picnic in the park, at a viewpoint or overlooking the seaside. A loaf of fresh bread, cheese, olives and a bottle of wine makes the perfect accompaniment to watching the sunset.\n\nConsider staying in a hostel\n\nPortugal has many of Europe’s most stylish hostels, some of which are set in historic buildings and feature upscale amenities like roof terraces, art-filled lounges or swimming pools. Rates start at around €22 per night ­– big savings over a traditional hotel. Many hostels also offer budget-friendly activities, like free walking tours or pub crawls and free or low-cost rentals of bikes, surfboards and other gear. Some even host communal dinners, which are a great way to meet other people while saving money in the process.\n\nEven beach destinations like the Algarve have fabulous deals © wundervisuals / Getty Images\n\nPlan your itinerary around less expensive destinations\n\nDon’t rule out visiting Portugal’s most appealing cities. Places like Lisbon and Porto have a wide range of accommodations, and you can find excellent prices if you’re willing to stay outside the center (or in a more centrally located hostel). You can also find inexpensive activities (free museums, neighborhood exploring), and you won’t spend much on transportation.\n\nThe Algarve also has good deals if you know where to look. If you don’t want to stay in a hostel, you’ll find some of the best prices in Faro and Portimão. The Algarve is also among the best places for budget-friendly activities: scenic walks along headland trails above the beach and frolicking in the waves won’t cost you anything.\n\nDine in a tasca, adega and other local haunts\n\nNo matter where you roam, you can eat well in Portugal without breaking the bank if you know where to look. Among the key places to seek out is the tasca, an old-fashioned eatery (often with a loyal local following) that serves up excellent daily specials (which are not always listed on the menu) as well as classic staples like bacalhau (codfish) dished up many different ways. Slightly more convivial are adegas, usually decorated with wine casks and serving up hearty, inexpensive meals along with carafes of very affordable wine.\n\nPicnicking with ingredients from a local market is a must in Portugal – and also a cheaper alternative to a restaurant © T.W. van Urk / Shutterstock\n\nBecome a picnic expert\n\nSprinkled throughout Portugal, you’ll find mercados (markets), where you can browse for cheeses, charcuterie, baked goods and other fare. When no market is near, head to the nearest supermarket, where you can also score Portuguese produce at rock-bottom prices. With a bit of strategic planning, you can make a fun day out of your food shopping and sightseeing, stopping at a scenic spot for a picnic along the way.\n\nPlan your days around free and low-cost activities\n\nSome of the best things to do in Portugal won’t set you back much. A trip on a tram around Lisbon or Porto offers a great view of dynamic neighborhoods without the cost or hassle of taking a guided tour. Many churches are free to visit, as are parks and miradouros (viewpoints). Be sure to budget in downtime at cafes, where you can linger over inexpensive drinks while making plans for the day or evening ahead.\n\nIn the Algarve, you can design a day of beach hopping, followed by sunset viewing at one of the region's fabled overlooks (like the Cabo de São Vicente). You can also explore the islands of the eastern Algarve, reachable by inexpensive ferries from Faro, Olhão and Tavira.\n\nAt some restaurants in Portugal, a glass of wine can cost as much as a bottle of water © Alexander Spatari / Getty Images\n\nOrder the house wine\n\nPortugal has some excellent, affordable wines you can enjoy over dinner by ordering the house wine (vinho da casa). You can order by the glass or a carafe (jarro), ranging in size from 0.25 liters (around two glasses) to 0.75 liters. At many family-run eateries, a glass of house wine costs about the same as a bottle of water.\n\nTake a walk\n\nMountains and rugged coastlines make a memorable backdrop to one of Portugal’s greatest free outings: hitting the trail. You can plan your whole trip around a famous multi-day walk – like the Rota Vicentina that passes along sea cliffs and over deserted beaches on Portugal’s southwest coast. Or you can base near one of Portugal’s nature reserves and go on a day hike over craggy hillsides, beneath medieval ruins and through old stone villages – all features you’ll find in the Parque Nacional Peneda-Gerês in Portugal’s northeast.\n\nDaily costs\n\nHostel room: €22-35\n\nBasic room for two: €50-80\n\nSelf-catering apartment (including Airbnb): from €80\n\nLisbon metro ticket: €1.50\n\nMeia de leite (café latte): €2-3\n\nBifana (pork cutlet sandwich): €3-5\n\nDinner for two: from €30\n\nBeer at the bar: €2-4.50",

    "Braga’s Push to Break the Big Three Hegemony in Portugal": "Braga’s Push to Break the Big Three Hegemony in Portugal\n\nWidely considered to be the fourth club in a country dominated by ‘The Big Three’, SC Braga might just be on the cusp of breaking the hegemony in Portuguese football. Their excellent start to 2022-23 certainly has fans on the edge of their seats…\n\nSC Braga, under the tutelage of their new manager Artur Jorge, have started the season in spectacular form, both domestically and in European competition. Since drawing on the opening day of the Primeira Liga season at home to Sporting CP, Braga have gone on to win every single match – six in league, two in UEFA Europa League, scoring goals aplenty and attracting plaudits both in Portugal and across Europe for their breathtaking performances.\n\nPortugal’s Fourth Club\n\nBraga, particularly in the 21st century, have established themselves as Portugal’s fourth club. A club which strives to fight at the top of Portuguese football, battling to break through the glass ceiling to reach Os Tres Grandes or The Big Three, consisting of SL Benfica, FC Porto and Sporting CP. The last time they finished in the top three wasn’t too long ago, finishing third in 2019-20; a season where they took advantage of a Sporting CP that were seemingly in free-fall both off and on the pitch.\n\nBack in 2009-10, Braga recorded their best league campaign, finishing second under Domingos Paciência, picking up a fantastic 71 points and losing just three games all season. A year later, Braga managed to reach the UEFA Europa League final in Dublin, eventually losing to FC Porto 1-0 before Paciência was nabbed by Sporting CP in the summer. By and large though, Braga are usually found sitting just outside the top three, occupying fourth position. In fact, they’ve finished fourth in seven of the last 10 Portuguese top-flight seasons.\n\n2011 UEFA Europa League Final between Braga and Porto\n\nTheir electric start to 2022-23, however, has indicated that they may well be gunning to add another top-three finish to their record books. A key difference (and incentive) to note between the last time they went one further than the top three and finished second, is that due to Portugal’s coefficient ranking, Braga had to play UEFA Champions League qualifiers the following campaign in order to secure group stage football. This season however, a second-place finish would guarantee group stage football in Europe’s elite footballing competition, and third place would see them enter the qualifying rounds.\n\nNew Manager, New Ideas\n\nWhen Carlos Carvalhal, a manager who led Braga to a Taça de Portugal victory, consecutive fourth place finishes and to the UEFA Europa League quarter-finals, left the club at the end of last season to “embrace a new project”, Braga didn’t look to replace him with a manager of similar profile and experience, but instead opted to hand the reigns to one of their own, in the form of Artur Jorge.\n\nJorge, an ex-Braga player, has spent the majority of his coaching career working at the club in one capacity or another, whether it be as working as manager of Braga B, with the club’s U23 side or working with the youth teams at the club’s academy, as well as experiencing a month in charge of the first team as caretaker manager in 2020.\n\nThis season, Jorge has moved Braga away from the 3-4-3/3-4-2-1 formation that they often utilised under Carvalhal and before that, Rúben Amorim. The Braga boss has instead opted for a more traditional 4-4-2, allowing Simon Banza and either Abel Ruiz or Vitinha to work off one another up top.\n\nInterestingly, Artur Jorge’s approach this season hasn’t been to try and emulate Benfica, Porto and Sporting, instead they’re playing their own brand of more direct football, and it’s working.\n\nBraga have had the joint most shots (19) and scored the most goals (5) from high turnovers in Portugal so far this season. They don’t press as high up the pitch as the big three, but they time their press to perfection and only seem to press the opponent in their defensive third when they think that they’ll get a shooting opportunity from doing so.\n\nField tilt is a metric to show the territorial dominance between teams. Put simply, it measures the share of possession a team has in a game, considering only touches or passes in the attacking third. It can be useful when trying to understand which team is more dominant in games, rather than looking at overall possession, mainly as it looks at how teams are able to get the ball into areas that matter.\n\n\n\nWhen we look at the field tilt numbers in the Primeira Liga this season, the stark difference between Braga and the big three becomes even clearer. Benfica are currently averaging 84.6%, Sporting CP 77.1% and FC Porto slightly less with 71.9%, Braga however are currently averaging only 57.5%, taking fewer touches in the opposition third and completing fewer passes in the opposition third, yet they lead the league for goals scored (23).\n\nAs the graphic above shows, Braga are averaging less passes per sequence than the big three. In fact, Braga’s 3.4 passes per open play sequence actually means they are currently closer to promoted Casa Pia and Rio Ave (3.1 and 3.0 pps respectively) in that regard than to Benfica and Sporting (4.4 and 4.3 pps).\n\nThis directness from Braga starts at the first whistle and is a key reason why they’ve often started games on the front foot. 26.% of Braga’s goals so far this season in the Primeira Liga have been scored inside the first 15 minutes. In the match against Famalicão, Braga effectively killed the game off after 18 minutes, scoring twice and then managing the game brilliantly, allowing Famalicão to have possession in safe areas and then intelligently choosing when to hunt the ball back without leaving themselves exposed.\n\nAs the numbers indicate, Braga’s efficiency so far this season has been a key reason for their success. In front of goal, they have been ruthless. In the space of just over two weeks, Braga beat Famalicão 3-0, Marítimo 5-0 and Arouca 6-0 – 14 goals from 28 shots on target, meaning half their shots on target were hitting the back of the net.\n\nSC Braga players have scored 23 goals (excluding own goals) from an expected goals total of just 15.1 – a league-high overperformance of 7.9.\n\nOf course, it helps considerably when your top players are creating chances and firing on all cylinders when in front of goal. In Braga’s case, Ricardo Horta and Simon Banza, as well as several others, have started the season in emphatic fashion for Artur Jorge’s side.\n\nBanza’s exploits last season at Famalicão (18 goals and seven assists) were enough for Braga to bring him to the Estádio Municipal and give the Frenchman a platform to perform at the top end of the table and so far, he hasn’t disappointed. In his first five games of the season, he scored five goals and provided one assist for Braga.\n\nAnother talented forward that Braga have at their disposal is the exciting 22-year-old striker Vitinha, who himself has three goals and one assist in just six starts. Vitinha is generally very involved in the game for a traditional striker, averaging a healthy 31.7 touches per game, putting in 1.6 tackles per game and making 1.1 clearances per game. It was Vitinha’s smart rebound against Bundesliga leaders Union Berlin which gave Braga all three points away from home in the UEFA Europa League, a goal that epitomised his striker’s instinct.\n\nWhilst Braga will be delighted at both Banza and the rest of the teams’ goalscoring exploits, they will undoubtedly be aware that their potency in front of goal will not last forever. Their xG overperformance of 7.9 is probably not sustainable in the long term, thus they will be expecting a bit of a crash in front of goal soon. For further comparison, the biggest overperformance of xG across the whole of last season in Portugal was 5.3 by Tondela, while Benfica followed with 3.7 goals more than their xG total.\n\nKeeping Hold of Ricardo Horta\n\nIt’s impossible to talk about Braga’s superb start to the season without analysing their key man, the club’s all-time top scorer, the magnificent Ricardo Horta.\n\nThroughout the transfer window, Horta was the subject of a very publicised transfer saga linking him with a move to Lisbon giants SL Benfica, with The Eagles’ president Rui Costa admitting on several occasions that the club were very keen on signing the 28-year-old Portugal international. The interest in him was expected, Horta was hot off scoring 23 goals and providing 10 assists across all competitions, seeing him named in the Liga Portugal Team of the Season.\n\nUndoubtedly one of the best players in the division, it seemed almost inevitable at times that Horta would depart, and Braga would have to pick up the pieces to begin a search for a solution to the gaping hole their most influential player exiting would leave behind.\n\nHowever, when the transfer window slammed shut, Horta was still a Braga player. The club and its passionate supporters breathed a collective sigh of relief.\n\nIf you thought for a moment that this very public courting of Horta would in any way affect his morale and his performances going forward for Braga, you would be sorely mistaken. He has started the season in simply electric form. Some players can either create chances or take chances, Horta does both consistently with equal efficiency. His 56 attacking sequence involvements puts him second in the league behind Enzo Fernandéz, but what is remarkable about Horta’s numbers is how evenly distributed they are, 16 involvements in the build-up to shot, 18 chances created, and 22 shots shows that Horta isn’t currently excelling in just one particular area, but instead he’s doing it across the board. In terms of solely chances created, no player has created more than Horta so far this season (20) and only two players have created more from open play than he has (16).\n\nHorta’s consistency and efficiency when creating and taking chances means he is currently the league leader for combined goals and assists with seven, consisting of four goals (second most in the league) and three assists (most in the league).\n\nHis importance to Braga becomes even more obvious when his numbers are compared to the rest of his Braga team-mates. He is their key man and if they are to remain on their upward trajectory and potentially fight for a top three position, keeping Horta fit and firing will undoubtedly be key.\n\nA Brilliant Start, but That’s All It Is\n\nArtur Jorge’s side displayed character and heart on the opening day against Sporting, coming back from behind three times to take a well-earned point. Another test came in the form of their Minho rivals Vitória SC. This was a big test for Braga, who at this point had won three successive matches without conceding a goal but wary that on derby day, form can go out of the proverbial window. The result? Braga won 1-0 courtesy of a Vítor Tormena winner in the eighth minute of second-half stoppage time, which was nearly the final act of the match, with their rivals barely having time to kick-off. The best possible way to beat your fiercest rivals and maintain your winning streak.\n\nFast forward a few weeks to today and Braga remain unbeaten both domestically and in Europe, but they will not be getting carried away. A brilliant start is great, but it’s exactly that, a start. Their next match after the international break is a huge test of their credentials, a trip to the Estádio do Dragão to face defending champions FC Porto.\n\nSérgio Conceição’s men come into this one in poor form and lacking confidence, having won just twice in their last six matches in all competitions. On one hand, Braga will feel like it’s a great time to take on the Dragons, but on the other hand, this is a Porto side that will need no motivation, who know that defeat on the day will see them fall six points behind Braga.\n\nIf Braga are serious about usurping one of the big three, if only for this season, then it is in matches like this one that their credentials will really be examined. Lose and it’s not the end of the world, win and Braga fans will be in dreamland for yet another week.\n\nEnjoy this? Subscribe to our newsletter to receive five stories each Friday.",

    "Americans Moving To Europe: Portugal Still Top Place For Expats Despite Restrictions": "Portugal, a favorite among expats getty\n\nHousing prices, political divisions, high cost of living, the rise of remote work, crime rates in some U.S. cities, a strong dollar now at parity with the euro for the first time in more than 20 years — these are among the reasons experts mention to explain the wave of Americans relocating to Europe, or planning to do so in the near future.\n\nSome have other, more personal reasons such as love for the European way of life, the food, wine, a job or following family members who have already moved to the old continent.\n\nIn a recent article entitled “Americans Who Can’t Afford Homes Are Moving to Europe Instead,” Bloomberg writes that the traditional trends of retirees and the wealthy as the prime American buyers of real estate in Europe have changed: “Relatively cheap housing — particularly in smaller cities and towns — and the rise of remote work have made the continent alluring to a wider range of people, including those who are younger and find themselves priced out of the housing market at home.”\n\nMORE FROM FORBES Why Are Vienna And Six Other European Cities The Best In The World To Live In?\n\nAmericans’ high demand for houses in Europe\n\nDigital nomad working from a beach terrace getty\n\nInternational real estate businesses release data every day showing a growing interest from American buyers, particularly concerning Portugal, Greece, Italy and Spain, among others, that offer special deals for golden visas, digital-nomad visas, green visas and lower-cost housing.\n\nIn the past few years, Portugal appears at the top of most of the lists of places recommended for expats and retired people to enjoy a good life and its golden visa program is one of the most popular in the world. The number of Americans living in Portugal rose 45% in 2021 from the previous year, according to government data.\n\nIn Spain, also a popular destination and hosting the largest American population in Europe, the number of U.S.-born residents rose 13% between 2019 and 2021 and demand continues to rise.\n\nSotheby’s International Realty has said that requests from Americans looking to move to Greece rose 40% in the April-to-June period this year compared to a year earlier.

    "Four picture-perfect escapes in Portugal": "Garden-variety chic in Lisbon\n\nThe patio at Hotel das Amoreiras © Francisco Nogueira\n\nLisbon is the city that keeps on giving hotel wise: every month, it seems, some enterprising architect, decorator or chef announces bold new life being given to a patrician old house. Here’s one from a more leftfield team, promising unique country-in-the-city ambiance: Hotel das Amoreiras, on one of the most photogenic squares in the (already pretty ready for its close-up) enclave of Príncipe Real. Pedro Oliveira and Alicia Valero brought experience in private banking and luxury marketing respectively to their dream of opening a very small, special hotel. In 2016, returning home after stints in London and Switzerland, they found just the site: two adjoining townhouses for sale on the garden Oliveira had grown up playing in.\n\nThe façade of the Hotel das Amoreiras © Francisco Nogueira (2) ...and its bar and restaurant\n\nBesides the two huge suites that take up the entire joined third floor of the hotel, 17 further rooms fill the first and second ones. Promising details include works by Giacometti and Manolo Valdés, lighting by the Florentine designer Michele Bönan, and a hushed, white-on-white private courtyard for breakfast or cocktails. hoteldasamoreiras.com, from €250\n\nSurf, sea and ceviche on the central coast\n\nAethos sits 40m above the Calada beach © Francisco Nogueira\n\nAround 30 miles north of Lisbon is Ericeira, Portugal’s own surf mecca, where those who dare can ride colossal winter swells that power in from the mid-Atlantic (and those who don’t can watch the action from the picturesque bluffs set behind the beaches). In June, Immerso opened here, bringing a high-bar hospitality that privileges wellness and local experiences (artisan visits and, yes, surf lessons) to the enclave. Now it’s the turn of Aethos, a hotel/nomadic traveller-private members’ club concept based in Milan that also has small boutique hotels in Umbria and Corsica (and will soon add Lisbon and Mallorca to the portfolio as well).\n\nThe ocean suite at Aethos © Przemyslaw Nieciecki\n\nOnda restaurant at Aethos © Przemyslaw Nieciecki\n\nThe 46 rooms and four suites at Aethos Ericeira hover cliffside in a sleek three-storey building some 40m above the ocean. Surfboards, e-bikes and sand buggies are there for guests’ use. The kitchen at the restaurant Onda favours the plant-based and locally sourced (but with tartares and ceviches aplenty, too); the spa favours North African traditions, with a hammam and hot limestone slabs. aethoshotels.com, from €200\n\nMelides gets a new house style\n\nOne of the four houses at Pa.te.os © Francisco Nogueira\n\nMelides, so has said the tastemakers’ grapevine for some time now, is the new Comporta – further south, more spread out, with some intriguing architectural incursions and dynamic buzz around a burgeoning contemporary art scene. It’s where Miguel and Sofia Charters recently opened Pa.te.os – four discrete houses, immersed in cork and arbutus groves a couple of miles inland from the Atlantic. Like an extremely understated compound, they group loosely in 80 hectares of land – separate, private, but not distant from each other.\n\nA living area in one of the Pa.te.os houses © Francisco Nogueira\n\nThe sublime is in the palette and materials: Manuel Aires Mateus, the Portuguese architect of the moment (though he’s been that for a decade now) has invented incredible care into materials and palette. All is sand or pearl, caramel or bone: the warm tones of the earth, stone and wood that were the only materials deployed in Pa.te.os’ creation.

In 1998 five members of the Soares family bought an abandoned farm here, and spent the ensuing 24 years slowly and carefully bringing it back to life – ruined cottage and outbuildings, olive groves and all.\n\nA double bedroom in Malhadinha Nova’s Casa das Pedras © João Guimarães\n\nToday it consists of two small hotels, a clutch of villas, a restaurant (open to outside guests), and a small, lovely spa – all spread across Malhadinha’s 450 hectares, well away from each other. The wines win awards, the kitchens source from the Soares’ own estate gardens. Here, too, the family is currently working with architect Aires Mateus on developing a series of new standalone accommodations, including some modelled after (extremely chic) treehouses.

(AP Photo/Petr David Josek)\n\nA look at what’s happening in European soccer on Tuesday:\n\nLEAGUE A\n\nLast year’s Nations League runner-up Spain visits Portugal in a winner-take-all match to decide who advances to the Final Four from Group A2. Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal can secure first place with a draw in Braga. It took the group lead with a 4-0 win over the Czech Republic and Spain’s 2-1 home loss to Switzerland at the weekend. Portugal may see the return of forward João Félix, who missed the game against the Czech Republic because of an injury sustained while playing with Atlético Madrid. Portugal won the inaugural edition of the Nations League at home in 2019 but did not make it to the Final Four last year. Spain lost last year’s final to France. Switzerland, coming off consecutive victories over Portugal and Spain, hosts the Czech Republic needing a draw to avoid relegation to League B.\n\nLEAGUE B\n\nThere are two showdown games to decide which teams join Bosnia-Herzegovina and Israel in being promoted to the top tier. Norway hosts Serbia tied on 10 points in Group B4 but needs only a draw. Norway holds the tiebreaker from its 1-0 win in Belgrade in June. The game pits six-goal Erling Haaland against five-goal Aleksandar Mitrović. Ukraine and Scotland face each other for the third time in less than four months The two previous games were in Glasgow and now they meet in Krakow, Poland, because Ukraine cannot host international games during the Russian military invasion. A draw will seal the Group B1 title for Scotland and a better seeding in the European Championship qualifying draw next month. Scotland is without standout defender Kieran Tierney. The Arsenal left-back sustained a head injury in a 2-1 win over Ireland on Saturday. Ireland now hosts Armenia needing to avoid defeat to stay in the second-tier level. Israel completes the Group B2 program at Albania. The three-team group played without Russia whose teams has been suspended from UEFA and FIFA competitions.\n\nIn League C, Group C2 winner Greece hosts Northern Ireland which is in a three-way relegation fight. Kosovo hosts last-placed Cyprus.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",

    "Frederico Morais: Portugal surfer on career ups and downs in the WSL and the next generation": "It's been a difficult year for surfer Frederico Morais – and he'll be the first to admit it.\n\nThe Portuguese has struggled since a successful 2021 was derailed by him testing positive for Covid before surfing's Olympic Games debut at Tokyo 2020, and has fallen off the World Surf League (WSL) Championship Tour (CT) despite ranking in the top 10 last season.\n\nSpeaking to Olympics.com's Ash Tulloch at the ISA World Surfing Games in Huntington Beach, California, the 30-year-old said the structure of this season, which featured a cut on the WSL CT after the year's fifth event at Margaret River, Australia, was \"a really tough one\" for him to take.\n\n\"(In) 2021 I finished top ten, the best year of my career, and then the next year I'm falling off on the fifth stop of the tour,\" Morais said.\n\n\"It's a really tricky one because you're kind of counting on all the stops and then there's a cut on the fifth stop. Sometimes you go bad at the start of the year, then you kind of make it up on the second half of the year, so there is no room for mistake.\"\n\nFrederico Morais on bouncing back from disappointment\n\nThe native of Cascais has been here before.\n\n\"It's really challenging because it's like you're living the best years of your life and then it's over and you got to do it all over again,\" Morais said of falling out of the top tier.\n\n\"I've done it twice. I qualified my first time in 2016. Then in 2019, I re-qualify it again, and hopefully now in 2022, I'll re-qualify again.\"\n\nHowever, the realities of no longer competing on the CT and instead being on the second-tier tour have hit home.\n\n\"Being on the world tour and then being on the Challenger Series, it's literally two completely different tours in terms of waves, in terms of sponsors, in terms of image and marketing and just obviously money-wise.\n\n\"You really need to adapt yourself, your whole structure, who you're counting on, all your expenses. And sometimes that's not easy at all.\"\n\nHow Frederico Morais overcomes doubts\n\nMental health remains an important topic in sport, and surfing is no exception. \"I've been working with a sports psychologist since I'm 16, 17,\" Morais acknowledged.\n\n\"I guess it's almost like a mentor these days. It's someone I speak (to) openly. I'm not ashamed of telling anything, any fears, any stuff.\"\n\nAnd does it show? Yes, according to Morais.\n\n\"If it's waves, if it's nerves before a hit, or if it's why I lost, why I didn't. So it's someone where I can completely trust and open so we can figure out how I can better my performance. And it's pretty good. It makes a huge difference in my career.\"\n\nThe next generation of Portuguese surfers\n\nAt the ISA World Surfing Games, Morais is with his countrymen and women representing Portugal in an attempt to win a qualifying spot for the Olympic Games Paris 2024, with the surfing competition due to be held on the Teahupo‘o wave in Tahiti.\n\nAs one of the few top-level surfers on the WSL, Morais is hopeful that the next generation is ready to step up.\n\n\"There's support. We have a lot of events in Portugal,\" he said.\n\n\"We have really good waves in Portugal. Obviously, our surfing there is really recent compared to Australia, America, Brazil. So we're still developing a lot of intel and in terms of coaches and even athletes and all the methods.\"\n\nBut it will not be a quick process, Morais acknowledged. \"You know, just little things, that takes time.\n\n\"But we definitely have really good coaches, we have really good upcoming kids.\n\n\"So I think it's just a matter of time that you'll see some other kid doing the QS (qualifying series) and, you know, doing the CT (Championship Tour) as well.\"\n\nWhat's next for Frederico Morais\n\nMorais has his sights firmly set on Paris 2024 after missing out on Tokyo due to his positive Covid test.\n\nBut more pressing at hand is attempting to get back onto the WSL CT.\n\n\"I guess we're doing it for the dream,\" he explained. \"It's every surfer's dream to be on the tour. It's still my dream. And I feel like I still have a lot to give.\"\n\nAnd with Portugal's upcoming talents on his radar, Morais wants to play a role in bringing the next generation through.\n\n\"I don't want them to be another Frederico Morais. I want them to have their own career. But if I can help in any way, or if I can inspire them in any way, then my mission is accomplished.\"",

    "Portugal’s Next Great Beach Vacation Destination: Ericeira": "The new Aethos Ericeira hotel Francisco Nogueira\n\nTo be fair, Portugal’s Ericeira, about an hour northwest of Lisbon, isn’t exactly some brand new discovery. It’s been on the radar for a while now—at least for surfers. Its waves are more accessible than the gigantic ones up the coast at Nazaré, but reliably interesting for a range of skill levels, which is why it’s Europe’s only “surf reserve.” But while the town itself retains a lot of the charm of the fishing village that it once was, its services have tended toward hostels, surf schools and cafés serving açaí and quinoa bowls.\n\nThat changed this summer with the opening of two new five-star hotels in the general surroundings of the town—not walking distance but within easy reach if you come with a car. (Call them Ericeir-ish.) Surfers are still more than welcome of course, but they also offer quite a lot to people who don’t care about chasing waves. And, joining with the existing hotel You and the Sea, they’re set to change the appeal and perception of Ericeira.\n\nTo be sure, Ericeira is unlikely to become the new Comporta, at least not anytime soon. But now it’s turning into a place that promises its own brand of slow travel. It’s a destination for people who appreciate nature (not just beaches), stylish design, quality materials and good food, but without the glamour or the need to see and be seen.\n\nImmerso Francisco Nogueira\n\nThe first hotel to change the perception and position of Ericeira is Immerso (as in “immersion in nature”), which opened earlier, and which is built into a hillside to help it blend into its surroundings and to ensure that each of the 37 rooms has an excellent ocean view, especially at sunset. In fact, the television is to the side of the bed, making it a bit awkward to watch—the idea is to look straight ahead, out the window, instead.\n\nThe design, by Portuguese architect Tiago Silva Dias and designers Alexandra Almeida d’Eca (one of the founders of the hotel) and Bárbara Neto, is simple, with concrete floors, woven rugs in natural colors, organic shapes, artisan furnishings and textures from the land and sea. They worked a number of artists on items for the rooms, indoor lounge, long terrace and pool deck and fire pit.\n\nThe spa is more ambitious than it needs to be, with heat and wet areas, three treatment rooms and a menu of services based on the vegan, natural skincare brand Vinoble Cosmetics. The massage list ranges from Japanese shiatsu to hot stones to Ayurveda.\n\nEmme restaurant at Immerso Francisco Nogueira\n\nThe restaurant, Emme, also takes its cues from the hotel owners’ conscious, local and natural philosophy. Dogma aside, its quite good, with a brief but tasty menu, a lively relaxed dining room and snappy service. The consulting chef is Alexandre Silva, who holds a Michelin star at his Lisbon restaurant Loco and earned a reputation for his excellent cooking with fire at Lisbon’s Fogo and the Alentejo’s Craveiral FarmTable.\n\nExecuted here by resident chef Paulo Pedro (ex-Fortaleza do Guincho), the menu is strong on local fish and seafood—the trio of oysters is an excellent starter, and the simple main courses are tasty—with some vegetables from the organic kitchen garden and saline-tasting plants from the sea mixed in. The spread for the breakfast buffet is well above average. When it opens later this autumn, Emme on Fire will be an outdoor, communal dining experience based on food cooked over an open fire—what they’re calling a “medievally festive” experience.\n\nBy coincidence, Immerso was joined last week by Aethos Ericeira, an unrelated hotel that also happens to prioritize consciousness, nature, community, wellness and design. On top of a 130-foot-high cliff in a nature reserve, it has spectacular natural light and lovely views over the Atlantic. It’s part of the the Aethos group (after the Greek “ethos,” or characteristic spirit of a culture), a collection of members clubs and boutique hotels in Europe that was founded by a pair of international serial entrepreneurs who want to create a “global family of conscious explorers.”\n\nThe lounge at Aethos Ericeira Francisco Nogueira\n\nAt the Ericeira hotel, which was designed by the Barcelona studio Astet and Portuguese architect Luís Pedra Silva, that means 50 suites and rooms that blend natural tones, materials and textures with the clean lines and soft simplicity of modernist design. The premium rooms have glorious views over the ocean, sometimes with private terraces.\n\nAt the restaurant, Onda (“wave”), chef Afonso Blazquez and his team focus on shareable, sustainable fish and seafood from the surrounding coast, with plenty of vegetables in the mix. The dinner menu includes dishes like asparagus with fresh green curry, bergamot gel and sourdough croutons, and squid “noodles” with pickled mushrooms and dashi. The oysters here are excellent as well.\n\nIn line with the Aethos philosophy, there’s a strong wellness component, including a spa that uses organic products from Sweden’s Under the Skin brand, a gym with expert trainers, yoga classes with world-class instructors, a meditation deck overlooking the Atlantic and a stone-trimmed saltwater pool. But this Ericeira—and surfing checks quite a few of those same wellness boxes. (I dare you to think about anything other than surfing when you’re doing it.)\n\nA guest room at Aethos Ericeira Francisco Nogueira\n\nAnd Aethos being a five-star hotel, it has its own luxury take on the sport. It has a dedicated surf concierge, onsite storage facilities for boards and wetsuits, and onsite rentals. It also has a relationship with Joana Andrade, Portugal’s first female big wave surfer and champion several times over. She also started Portugal’s first female surf school in 1998, and continues to coach professionals as well as beginners.\n\nAethos guests of any skill level can book a private session with her and accomplish quite a lot in terms of skills and especially confidence in a short time. It’s a luxury version of surfing for sure, and also very much in line with the new direction of Ericeira.",

    "Portugal reaffirms ‘total’ commitment to NATO": "Portugal reaffirms ‘total’ commitment to NATO. Portugal is wholly committed to NATO and would always comply with the Alliance’s resolutions when necessary, President Marcelo Rebelo De Sousa said on Tuesday.\n\n“On behalf of the Portuguese people, I reaffirm Portugal’s total commitment as a member of NATO, as a founder of NATO, wherever and whenever it is needed,” said Rebelo de Sousa at the Air Force Air Command in Monsanto (Lisbon). The president delivered his speech in English as part of the commemorative ceremony marking the 20th anniversary of NATO’s Joint Analysis and Lessons Learned Centre (JALLC).\n\nAt the ceremony – which was also attended by Defence Minister Helena Carreiras – the president said that Portugal maintains its commitments to help the “brave Ukrainian people” and “the Baltic countries, Romania, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Mediterranean Sea, in improving information, cyber-attack prevention actions, and geostrategic analysis”.\n\nThe president also stressed that it was precisely because of this commitment that Portugal was “one of the last – if not the last [country] – to leave Afghanistan”.\n\n“We remain ready and steadfast, with our soldiers, in the most difficult battlefields, on all continents, but especially in Europe,” he stressed.\n\nThe president indicated that “in recent decades, more than ever”, NATO has become “much more than an Alliance of States or an Alliance of peoples”.\n\n“NATO is a crucial guarantee of peace, security and respect for the Charter of Nations, [it is a guarantee] of freedom and human dignity,” he said.\n\nJust before unveiling a plaque to mark the 20th anniversary of the JALLC, Rebelo de Sousa stressed that it “portrays the lifetime of the JALLC, but also symbolises the last 20 years of peace and friendship between the countries of the Alliance”\n\nAddressing the Supreme Commander of NATO’s Allied Command Transformation, General Philippe Lavigne, who attended the ceremony, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa wished him a “welcome” to Portugal.\n\n“You are in a reliable, friendly and warm country, which shares the values that distinguish democracy from dictatorship, freedom from oppression, peace from war,” he added.\n\n(Lusa.pt)",
    "Pregnant woman’s death causes outrage over crisis-hit Portugal health service": "The death of a pregnant woman who could not receive treatment in Lisbon’s main hospital because of a lack of capacity has been met with outrage in Portugal, where a months-long health crisis has shut emergency services across the country and put maternity care under extreme pressure.\n\nThe 34-year-old woman was admitted to Lisbon’s Santa Maria hospital on 23 August with respiratory problems and high blood pressure. Owing to a lack of space in the neonatal service, she was transferred to another hospital, but she died after a heart attack in the ambulance.\n\nHer baby, born at 30 weeks weighing 772g (1lb 11oz), survived.\n\nThe health minister, Marta Temido, in office since 2018 and throughout the Covid pandemic, resigned this week after the case came to light. She said in a short statement sent to the Guardian that she “no longer had conditions to stay in office”. The prime minister, António Costa, said the woman’s death was “the last straw” for Temido.\n\nMarta Temido said she ‘no longer had conditions to stay in office’. Photograph: Julien Warnand/EPA\n\nSanta Maria hospital said the patient had been stabilised, and it described transfers between regional hospitals as a “frequent procedure”. It told CNN that the woman’s death was “neither foreseeable nor expected in this situation”.\n\nAn investigation has been opened. The government’s general inspection of health activities (IGAS) is also examining the death of a baby on 9 June in Caldas da Rainha, north of Lisbon, after there were no obstetricians to assist the mother when she went into labour. On 22 August another pregnant woman had to be transferred twice between hospitals, travelling a total of 95 miles (150km) while in labour.\n\nNewspaper front pages have called Portugal’s formerly highly rated national health service (SNS) the “national disease service” and the health ministry the “ministry of pretend” after shutdowns left thousands without access to care in the virtually free public health system.\n\nThe crisis is a result of decades-long structural problems including low wages, outdated equipment and inefficient bureaucracy, said Dr Gustavo Tato Borges, the president of the National Association of Public Health Doctors.\n\nSalaries have not changed since 2009. A specialist physician has a monthly starting wage of €1,853 (£1,603) and a nurse €1,200. “There is no lack of doctors to fulfil the needs of the SNS, but rather a lack of doctors willing to subject themselves to working in the SNS,” Borges said. “The SNS does not have the capacity to attract doctors and ensure they stay for a long time.”\n\nWhile the number of doctors in Portugal has almost doubled in the last 20 years, almost half work in the private sector. It is estimated that a third of the population have health insurance, an almost twofold increase in the last 16 years, as waiting times have increased in the public health system.\n\nChild mortality is at its highest rate since 2018 and the third highest in the last decade. Portugal has an excess mortality rate of 23.9%, four times above the EU average.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

    "Legislative Changes Regarding Visas And Residence Permits In Portugal": "A new visa is created which allows entry into Portugal for people who intend to come here to seek work.\n\nIts aim is to (i) create the conditions to implement the Agreement on Mobility between the Member States of the CPLP of 17 July 2021, (ii) amend Law 23/2007 of 4 July, which approves the legal rules for the entry, stay, exit and expulsion of foreigners from Portuguese territory; (iii) amend Law 27/2008 of 30 June, which establishes the conditions and procedures for granting asylum or subsidiary protection, and the status of asylum seekers, refugees and subsidiary protection; (iv) implement into the Portuguese legal system the provisions of Law 27/2008 of 30 June, which establishes the conditions and procedures for granting asylum and subsidiary protection; and (iv) incorporate into Portuguese law Regulations (EU) 2018/1860, 2018/1861 and 2018/1862 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 November 2018, on the establishment, operation and use of the Schengen Information System. This law came into force on 26 August 2022 and its main points are:\n\n1. Visa for seeking work in Portugal\n\nA new visa is created for a period of 120 days, which can be extended for a further 60 days, which allows entry into Portugal for people who intend to come here to seek work. This visa will enable its holder to enter and remain in Portugal to seek work provided they comply with certain requirements. It authorises the holder to work as a dependent worker until the expiry of the visa or until a residence permit is granted. The visa for job seekers includes an appointment date with the SEF (Foreigners and Borders Service), within the 120 days referred to above. After the establishment and formalisation of the employment relationship within that period, it entitles the holder to apply for a temporary residence permit, provided that he or she fulfils the general conditions for it to be granted. An employment relationship must be established by the end of the maximum limit of validity of the visa to seek work and the subsequent process of document regularisation must have been started. If this does not happen, the holder of the visa will have to leave the country and can only reapply for a new visa for this purpose one year after the expiry of the previous visa.\n\n2. Temporary stay and residence visa for \"digital nomads\"\n\nThis law also establishes the possibility of granting a residence visa to employees and self-employed professionals to work remotely. These visas can be issued to individuals or companies with their domicile or registered office outside Portugal. The employment relationship or provision of services relationship, as appropriate, must be demonstrated.\n\n3. Issuance of residence pre-authorisation and consequent automatic allocation of provisional NIF, NISS and SNS numbers based on the residence permit.\n\nUnder this law, a residence pre-authorisation is issued upon the granting of the residence visa. This pre-authorisation contains information regarding the obtaining of the residence permit and the provisional allocation of the NIF (tax identification number), NISS (Social Security number) and SNS (National Health Service number).\n\n4. Elimination of quotas in the visa to work as an employee\n\nThe new law also abolishes the quota rules for residence visas for work as an employee. This rule had not been applied for around 3 years as a result of the State Budget Law.\n\n5. Creation of the Residence Permit for citizens from the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP):\n\nUnder the Agreement on Mobility between the Member States of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries concluded in Luanda on 17 July 2021 (CPLP Agreement), special conditions for granting visas to nationals of CPLP Member States are introduced:\n\nThe SEF's prior opinion is no longer necessary, and the offices responsible for issuing the visa will consult the Schengen Information System (SIS) databases directly and immediately.\n\nA refusal to issue a visa may only occur if there is an indication of a prohibition on entry and stay in the SIS, or if the citizen is a minor and does not have authorisation to travel.\n\nThe issuance of the visa is automatically communicated to the SEF.\n\n6. Residence Visa for family members of a holder of a temporary residence visa to accompany the holder\n\nAnother significant innovation in this law relates to the creation of a new temporary stay visa to allow the family of the holder of a temporary stay visa to accompany that holder. This visa may be requested simultaneously and will make it easier for family members of citizens who intend to establish themselves in Portugal to accompany them.\n\nIn the Expression of Interest in working as an employee or as a self-employed professional, it is now also possible to identify the members of the family of that person who are in Portugal. These family members will then benefit from the presumption of legal entry of the applicant, if applicable.\n\n7. Duration of residence permits\n\nWith this law, the general rule of validity of the residence permits is now:\n\nGeneral rule: Issued for an initial period (concession) of 2 years, renewable for periods of 3 years. This was already the position set out in the 2020 State Budget, and it has now become definitive.In turn, there are exceptions:\n\ni) Residence Permit for Investment (\"ARI\" or \"Golden Visa\") is issued for an initial period of 2 years, renewable for equal periods (the 3-year renewal rule does not apply).\n\nii) Residence Permit for Higher Education is now issued initially for 3 years and renewable for equal periods, and if the programme has a shorter duration, it will be issued for the duration of the programme.\n\niii) Residence Permit for Researchers is initially valid for 2 years, renewable for equal periods or for the duration of the hosting agreement if this is less than 2 years.\n\niv) Residence Permit for Interns is initially valid for six months, for the duration of the internship programme, plus a period of three months, if this is less than six months, or for 2 years in the case of a long-term internship. In this case, it may be renewed once for the remaining period of the internship programme.\n\nv) Travel permits for refugees will now be issued for periods of 5 years (instead of 1 year, as was previously the case), subject to renewals associated with any future renewal of the residence permit. The authenticity control will now be identical to that of the Portuguese electronic passport.",

The challenge was to create a wellness and mindfulness center based on the idea of community life at Serra da Estrela Nature Park, a UNESCO Global Geopark site and Portugal’s oldest and largest conservation area. The chosen property already included a number of preexisting buildings, which allowed developing the project despite the many constraints that limit any intervention in a conservation area.\n\nThe New Life Portugal wanted to make the most of the property’s excellent conditions to offer meditation, yoga, counselling, coaching, fitness, nature and mindfulness activities. So, the various facilities were designed with the goal of establishing a close relationship between the views and the surrounding nature and the concept of wellness, maximizing it.\n\nThe traditional buildings of the old “quintas” were transformed into accommodation units, while the program for the community facilities was the theme for designing contemporary buildings. Transforming the ruins implied their expansion, focused on the use of cork – a natural material that has optimal thermal insulation characteristics and an excellent aesthetic potential – to mark the difference between the old and the new.\n\nThe refurbishment of the 10 preexisting ruins allowed creating 4 residential clusters with a total of 49 private ensuite units, customized in order to guarantee a balanced combination of privacy and community life. The community facilities include a multifunctional community center, a meditation hall and a therapy center, in addition to the reception building.\n\nThe multifunctional community center, focused on relaxing and unwinding, is the social hub of the community, comprising a dining hall, a lounge area, a gym (which is also used for workshops, yoga sessions and meetings), an outdoor heated swimming pool, a sauna and a massage room.\n\nThe stunning meditation hall offers panoramic views over the valley. It is located at one of the highest sites of the property and creates the perfect atmosphere for meditation, yoga and mindfulness activities by making the most of the beauty of Serra da Estrela.\n\nThe therapy center comprises a number of rooms for one-on-one counselling and life coaching sessions, among other therapeutic activities, ensuring the necessary tranquility and comfort for restorative healing. This combination of modernity and traditional Portuguese architecture and materials, that fosters a strong communion with Nature, invites guests to feel a sense of openness in their search for balance between body and mind.",

Gualter Fatia/Getty Images\n\nA five-time Ballon d'Or winner, Ronaldo captained Portugal to Euro 2016 glory and the 2019 Nations League.\n\n\"I hope to be part of the Federation for a few more years,\" he added. \"I still feel motivated; my ambition is high. I'm in a team with young people. I want to be part of this World Cup and the European too; I'm going to assume that right away.\"\n\nRonaldo, who was included in Portugal's latest squad for the upcoming Nations League games against the Czech Republic and Spain, was thrilled to add another award to his collection as he got a standing ovation.\n\n\"I'm happy,\" he said. \"I already missed receiving an award.\n\n\"It's with pride that I see guys I played with, with whom I'm going to play.\"\n\nThe former Juventus and Real Madrid forward then joked about the length of his career. He laughed and said, \"Diogo [Dalot, a United and Portugal teammate] even jokes with me 'you played with everyone, until you become a carcass,' and it's true.\"\n\nPortugal midfielder Bruno Fernandes, who plays with Ronaldo at United, has backed Ronaldo to continue to break records in his international career after the World Cup, which begins in Qatar in November.\n\n\"Whoever could believe that he didn't want to be at that European Championship doesn't know him,\" Fernandes told a news conference on Wednesday.\n\n\"We know well the resilience, taste and ambition he has shown over the years. It's not new. We know that Cristiano wants to achieve things that others have never achieved. He will always have the same importance. He is the best player in the world, and he will continue to overcome barriers that others cannot.\"\n\nRonaldo, who scored 24 goals in 38 games in all competitions for United last season, was named on the 30-man list of Ballon d'Or nominees last month.\n\nRonaldo ended his goal drought from the penalty spot in a 2-0 win against Sheriff Tiraspol in the Europa League last week. It was his first goal in eight appearances this season and the 699th of his club career.",
    "In and out of Spain and Portugal: a road trip up the Guadiana River": "Strapped into a harness, hands clamped to a metal bar, I flew – at terrifying speed along 720 metres of zipwire suspended over the Rio Guadiana – from Spain into Portugal.\n\nI’d taken a boat from Alcoutim (on the Algarve side of the river) to Sanlúcar de Guadiana (in Andalucía). From there I was driven up to a launch platform on a rocky summit with jaw-dropping views of both countries. Did I scream? As I hurtled towards Portugal, I tried to focus on those views: two dazzling white villages, the wide green river below, a castelo on one side, a castillo on the other. It was all over in less than a minute, but thanks to the international time difference I gained an hour.\n\nThe LimiteZero experience (the world’s only cross-border zipline) was just one of the high points of a meandering road trip along the Rio Guadiana – the long river that rises in the Spanish province of Albacete, slips over the Portuguese border near Elvas in Alentejo and heads south to the Bay of Cádiz, on the Algarve’s eastern edge.\n\nLimiteZero, a unique cross-border zipline, spans Spain and Portugal. Photograph: Luís Costa\n\nDriving a hired Fiat 500, my husband Dave and I stuck mostly to the Portuguese side of the river, taking six days to do what amounts to a three-and-a-half-hour drive. For much of the route, the river forms a natural boundary between Spain and Portugal; a trail of castles and fortresses glare at each other from opposite riverbanks. Too many castles for one trip, perhaps, but there are lots of other things to see: salt marshes, walled towns and ancient river ports, lakes, river beaches, heavenly night skies and the wild landscapes of Alentejo’s Guadiana Valley national park, where the river squeezes into craggy ravines and kestrels and golden eagles circle over the waterfall at Pulo do Lobo (or Wolf’s Leap).\n\nA detour took us to the eerie ruins of the Sao Domingos pyrite mines, and later we pressed on to Elvas – a little-known border town with world heritage status – just to see the remarkable seven-kilometre Amoreira Aqueduct, which took more than 100 years to build (from 1537).\n\nThe 16th-century Amoreira Aqueduct in Elvas, Portugal, is a Unesco world heritage site. Photograph: Mauricio Abreu/Alamy\n\nAt the start of our trip we rolled into Vila Real de Santo António, a pleasant border town on the Guadiana estuary with wide marina promenades and pine-forest walks that lead to the dunes of Praia Santo António – one of the fabulously sandy and often-uncrowded beaches of the eastern Algarve.\n\n\n\nThe Spanish can nip across on a ferry from nearby Ayamonte – to shop (for towels, I am told), eat fresh tuna, garlic prawns and codfish stew at seafood cafes or sit under orange trees on Praça Marquês de Pombal. The town’s market square is at the heart of a masterplan dreamed up by the Marquês de Pombal, who oversaw the reconstruction of Lisbon – and then Vila Real – after devastating earthquakes in the 18th century.\n\nThe walled, pedestrian streets and houses of Monsaraz are built of flinty metamorphic rock (wear sensible shoes)\n\nThe town’s later prosperity was built on tinned fish, an industry that more or less died in the 1960s, leaving it to look unloved. Redundant canning factories at the Spanish end of town still lie derelict, but the centre’s “Pombaline” architecture has been spruced up in recent years.\n\n\n\nOn the square, the Pousada de Vila Real de Santo António, open since July 2021, is a delightful base, a collection of restored 18th-century buildings: a former kindergarten, the headquarters of the local Communist party and part of the bank next door, with pools and roof-terrace views of the Guadiana estuary (doubles from €130).\n\nThe Spanish come by ferry to visit Praça Marquês de Pombal in the Algarve. Photograph: Lewis Oliver/Alamy\n\nNext stop was Castro Marim. Just a few minutes’ drive upriver, this ancient river port sits between the Guadiana International Bridge (a towering, cable-stayed number visible for miles) and a marshy nature reserve rich with birdlife (flamingos come and go). There’s a medieval castle with views across the marshes to Spain, but the town is best known for salt – a natural wetland resource which has been mined in the region for aeons. Artisan salt panner Jorge Raiado offers tours and tastings at his family’s Salmarim salinas (salt pans) – white with sun-dried crystals which are harvested without machinery or chemicals.\n\nOur phones made erratic switches between Spanish and Portuguese time as we followed the river on a back road to Alcoutim. The home of the LimiteZero zipline sits among banks of orange, olive and almond groves and gardens of figs and apricots on one of the loveliest stretches of the Guadiana. The Praia Fluvial do Pego Fundo river beach is an oasis of cool green water and soft white sand imported from the coast. There’s also a castle (first built by the Moors, reconstructed in the 14th century and again 100 years later) and an archaeological museum displaying Roman pottery and a collection of medieval stone board games. Sanlúcar, the town’s Spanish twin, is five minutes away by boat.\n\nIn Sanlúcar del Guadiana, Spain, with Portugal in the background. Photograph: Roger Lee/Alamy\n\nThe place is popular with walkers, who come here to start (or finish) the Via Algarviana trail, a 300km footpath that runs from Cape St Vincent to Alcoutim. The 165km Grande Rota do Guadiana (or GR15) from Vila Real to Mértola also passes through.\n\nSign up to Inside Saturday Free weekly newsletter The only way to get a look behind the scenes of our brand new magazine, Saturday.

Photograph: Roger Lee/Alamy\n\nAs we drive north, the river swings away from the Spanish border into Alentejo countryside, meeting Mértola on the fringe of the national park. A labyrinth of cobbled streets, cats and crumbling buildings, the little town tumbles down to river wharfs and jetties from the rugged walls of yet another castle. Since pre-Roman times, it has served as a Gaudiana trading post, particularly important to the Moorish rulers, who shipped grains and minerals downriver to the Atlantic ports. Beneath the castle walls, the pretty whitewashed church of Nossa Senhora da Anunciação dates from the 12th century and was originally a mosque – one of the few relics of Portugal’s 500-year Islamic rule. For five-star views of Mertola from the opposite side of the river, budget hotel Quinta do Vau has doubles from €40 room-only.\n\nAnother hour’s drive took us north to Monsaraz, a beguiling town on a hump of schist that rises from the plains of Alentejo’s montada – a vast area of holm oaks and cork forests, vineyards, farms and megaliths. Its walled, pedestrian streets and whitewashed houses are built of flinty metamorphic rock (wear sensible shoes) and offer dreamy views of the largest artificial lake in Portugal, formed by the Alqueva Dam.\n\nThe castle and bell tower in Monsaraz in Alentejo. Photograph: Joe Daniel Price/Getty Images\n\nLater we turned our gaze to the night sky. The Alqueva region is the first in the world to be recognised as a Starlight Tourism Destination, thanks to clear skies, a sparse population and a collective drive to keep the lights low at night. Set in forest on the edge of the Alqueva lake, Montimerso Skyscape Country House has roomy suites and generous terraces with views of the montada and deck chairs for stargazing (from €200 B&B).\n\nWe were lucky to choose a moonless, cloudless evening for a late-night stargazing session at the “official” Dark Sky observatory, in a former primary school in tiny Cumeada.\n\nIn a courtyard we stood and stared into space while our guide picked out Pegasus, Taurus, Auriga and the Milky Way. Andromeda, a mere 2.5 million light years away, is, he told us, the farthest we humans can see with the naked eye. We could see it here.\n\nThen it’s down to earth, back the way we came. I’d like to do it all again – maybe on the Spanish side of the river – though I am in no hurry to repeat the zipline experience.\n\nThe trip was provided by Visit Algarve.

    "Health authorities working with community stakeholders to control Monkeypox in Portugal": "During 3–12 May 2022, 2 sexual health clinics in Lisbon, Portugal were concerned to see a small number of patients presenting with unusual genital lesions, rashes and systemic symptoms including fever and swollen lymph nodes.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Margarida Tavares is Director of the National Programme for Sexually Transmitted Infections and HIV Infection and an infectious diseases consultant at Centro Hospitalar Universitário de São João, in Porto and remembers how they were at a loss to explain the disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n“At that time, it wasn’t clear what was causing these symptoms, but the correlation of having a number of similar cases within the same period of time made us question what was happening, and report them so that we could hopefully get some answers.”\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentification of monkeypox\n\n\n\n\n\nWithout being able to give a diagnosis, the National Reference Laboratory logged the unexplained cases on the EpiPulse online portal – a tool set up by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) through which European public health authorities and global partners can collect, analyse, share and monitor infectious disease data.\n\n\n\n\n\nThree days later, the United Kingdom reported 4 laboratory-confirmed monkeypox infections, which allowed the Lisbon authorities to “join the dots” and get confirmation that they were also dealing with a monkeypox outbreak.\n\nResponding to the outbreak and involving civil society\n\n\n\nAs soon as the first case was confirmed as monkeypox virus, a rapid response team was set up on 17 May, consisting of sub-teams responsible for key response pillars (including coordination, clinical management, laboratory analysis, vaccination, epidemiological surveillance and risk communication).\n\n\n\n\n\nRight from the start, this team began a close dialogue with community-based organizations working with men who have sex with men (MSM), as it was in this group that the vast majority of cases were being found. The team also liaised with sexually transmitted infection (STI)/HIV testing and care centres, as well as venues, such as bars and sex-on-premises businesses, to consult them on key messages around monkeypox and the best approach for communicating them, particularly in the run-up to the upcoming Pride events Marcha do Orgulho on 18 June and Arraial Lisboa Pride on 25 June.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Together, the Pride events attract up to 100 000 participants, and are the highlight of the city’s LGBTQI+ calendar. They offered us a perfect opportunity to identify feasible and clear messages, to spread the word about monkeypox to those at most risk from infection, and to provide information on the symptoms to look out for, ways to avoid it and what to do about it if you catch it,” explained Ricardo Fuertes, a psychologist working at the National Programme and liaison with the community.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time that messages were being disseminated at Pride events, testing venues and hospitals readied to receive patients concerned about their symptoms in other parts of the city and the country.\n\n\n\nEvent organizers being part of the solution\n\n\n\nOrganizers of the two Pride events, together with Grupo de Ativistas em Tratamentos (GAT), a community-based organization that carries out counselling and testing for HIV and other STIs, were also involved in the design and distribution of informative materials, including a pocket-sized, bilingual guide (in Portuguese and English) that used images of a prickly gherkin to draw attention to the lesions and rashes characteristic of monkeypox. In addition, the organizers were provided with briefing information for staff, and were involved in the production of educational videos that were shown on large public screens at one of the events.\n\n\n\nRapid responses in coordination with the community\n\n\n\nThe health authorities in Portugal made the most of existing contacts and networks of community services and representatives – relationships developed in response to HIV and their work with MSM, migrants and sex workers – to respond quickly. Community representatives were consulted before announcements to the national media, and venues such as bars and saunas were engaged and encouraged to put up information posters.\n\n\n\n\n\n“This alliance between health authorities, event organizers, community organizations and venues was crucial to our response,” says Dr Tavares. “And over time, this alliance has expanded as we realized we needed to include other subgroups, such as chemsex networks, and new geographic areas, such as Porto.”\n\n\n\n\n\nGAT and the national health authority worked together to set up a monkeypox helpline to answer questions around disease infection, transmission and vaccination, as well as where to get tested in case of suspected infection.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Tavares and Ricardo Fuertes believe that being pragmatic about the prevention measures being recommended and targeting the most at-risk groups, without stigmatizing or blaming have been important factors in getting people to take notice of their messages and in the success of their campaign. While Portugal continues to see monkeypox cases reported, the country was one of the first to show signs of stabilizing transmission. Now, the work is to focus on bringing case numbers down further, and stopping the outbreak entirely.\n\n\n\nPreparing for a national vaccination programme\n\n\n\nSimilar steps to those described above are now being taken in preparation for the roll-out of a national preventive vaccination programme. Community partners and venue owners have once again been consulted on many of the practical considerations needed for this, including deciding on the appropriate eligibility criteria for vaccination, the location of vaccination points and the way that information will be communicated to reach those at most at risk.\n\n\n\n\n\nGAT’s CheckpointLX, a screening centre for HIV and other STIs, is playing a key role in these plans and has already been designated as one of the 3 vaccination points for monkeypox in the Lisbon metropolitan area due to its close links to the most at risk MSM communities. With vaccines as a new tool in the response for Portugal, the continued engagement and involvement of the affected community in all its interventions will be the key to ending the outbreak in the country.",
    "The Argument for an Off-Season Portugal Trip": "7 items in this article 1 item on sale! Photo-Illustration: The Strategist; Photos: Ariel Arce\n\nEveryone knows that person who spends weeks sniffing around travel blogs, going deep into Tripadvisor rabbit holes, collecting Google docs from friends of friends, and creating A Beautiful Mind–style spreadsheets to come up with the best vacations and itineraries possible. In this recurring series, we find those people who’ve done all the work for you and have them walk us through a particularly wonderful, especially well-thought-out vacation they took that you can actually steal.\n\nAriel Arce, owner of Tokyo Record Bar and Niche Niche, prefers to visit southern Europe during the off-season. She and her best friend (and partner in the founding of CaviAIR), Michelle Double, like to take easygoing road trips through seaside towns when they’re not mobbed by tourists. This past March, the pair headed to Portugal, during which they slowly meandered from Lisbon to the southern reaches of the country. Arce admits that her vacations “end up being these crazy drudges” of nonstop activities — filled with cave exploring, cliffside rock scrambling, and scootering around — which is why she highly recommends renting a boat for a day in the Algarve.\n\nDay 1\n\n11 a.m.: Scoot around Lisbon\n\nWe flew on a red-eye from New York and upon landing in Lisbon headed straight to the Hertz counter to pick up our car rental for the week: a gunmetal Mercedes convertible. Michelle and I love driving. Give us a fast luxury car, throw us the keys, and see ya! But because it was still quite early in the day, we decided to explore Lisbon for a few hours before our drive south. We hit up the legendary seafood restaurant Ramiro (Av. Alm. Reis 1 H, 1150-007) and ordered a massive plate of prawns, some crusty bread to dip into the garlicky sauce they’re cooked in, and a couple of beers.\n\nWe wanted to work off the beer so we rented scooters from the Uber app and giggled our way around Lisbon. We toured along the water promenade all the way out to the western district of Alcantara to check out LxFactory (R. Rodrigues de Faria 103, 1300-501), a modern outdoor food and shopping complex under one of the city’s many bridges. And then for absolutely conflicting vibes, we zoomed our way back into downtown Lisbon and up the steep cobblestone streets of Alfama, where we grabbed a caffeine pick-me-up at Copenhagen Coffee Lab (Escolas Gerais 34, 1100-213).\n\n5 p.m.: Settle into your eco villa and order pizza\n\nBy the time we reached our hotel for the night, it had been a long day so we decided to take it easy, and Villa Epicurea (R. do Casalinho 5A, 2970-052) — a 45-minute drive south of Lisbon — was the ideal place to do that. The property is tucked away into a forest that overlooks the water, and we stayed in one of their minimally decorated one-bedroom houses. We aren’t really “shared space” gals, but it was nice to see like-minded travelers at the pool or in the main house where you can cook a meal together. If you don’t want to make your own food (we didn’t), what’s cool about the Villa Epicurea is they have a board filled with places you can get delivery from. We ordered two pies from a local pizza place: Both had a super crispy thin crust, but one was a margherita and the other was a white pie with arugula and pistachio, which was pretty incredible.\n\nDay 2\n\n12 p.m.: Eat ceviche at a beach club in Comporta\n\nBefore we set off for the Algarve, we stopped by Comporta, a chic little beach town with waterfront restaurants and hotels, and an adorable downtown. It’s got a rustic vibe, too, because of the rice fields that surround all the development.\n\nWe had lunch at Sublime Comporta Beach Club (Praia do Carvalhal, 7570-782). The seafood on the menu was just exquisite. We gorged ourselves on ruby red tiger shrimp, oysters, and whatever ceviche they were serving at the time (with fish sourced from the Azores). In between dishes, we would walk around the sand and dip our toes in the water. (It was cold Atlantic water, but a few moments doesn’t hurt.) Everyone here is an angel. As soon as our waiter found out that I love spicy things, I had three different hot sauces in front of me, including the chef’s personal stash from Nepal.\n\n3 p.m.: Take coastal routes to the Algarve\n\nThe drive down to our resort in the Algarve should have taken about two hours if we stuck to the most straightforward route per Google Maps, but we tried to take as many coastal roads as possible, avoiding highways whenever we could so it took closer to three hours. But we also found ourselves driving through these stunning, dense forest roads that feel the way islands do when they’re by the water; there’s lots of sand, very tropical-esque foliage, and a quickly changing terrain. Everything looked wild and beautiful. It was definitely more of a casual drive. We were in no rush.\n\n6 p.m.: Check into a massive resort\n\nVila Vita Parc Resort & Spa (R. Anneliese Pohl, 8400-450) is a sprawling compound centered around a private beach, pools, a few restaurants, sports complexes, and a wellness center. For girls from a big city, a resort vacation wasn’t what we came for, but frankly, we didn’t want to leave. It was pretty stunning. We booked an apartment-style condo, which is a bit farther away from the main hub of the resort. This was the first time on our trip — after flying, driving, exploring — when we really started to relax.\n\nTo close out the day, we didn’t want to have a crazy dinner, but we did go to the main bar of the resort to indulge in a few too many gin-and-tonics by the fireplace.\n\nDay 3\n\n12 p.m.: Explore the seaside towns of the Algarve\n\nWe had a late start to the day, but that’s just the vibe down here in the Algarve, which isn’t very big so you can accomplish a lot of sightseeing in a short amount of time. Our first stop was Sagres, which is stuffed into the southwest corner of Portugal. It’s a very windy area and known for some of the best surfing in the world. We drove to Fortaleza de Sagres, which really feels like the end of the earth. All you see is water. We walked the coastline watching a bunch of people hit the waves.\n\nThere is a killer restaurant on the ocean called Boia Bar (R. dos Pescadores 101, 8650-199), in the tiny town of Budens, which is just 15 minutes east of Sagres. We ordered a massive bowl of razor clams and their famed Portuguese shrimp, cooked in chili, garlic, and olive oil galore (kind of like a piri-piri sauce).\n\n3 p.m.: Pick up ceramics and straw bags in Lagos\n\nLagos is one of the larger small towns and is far less sleepy than most of the other spots we hit on this adventure. It was great to walk around and get a taste for the colorful tile buildings that you won’t ever tire of when you’re in Portugal.\n\nThere’s some shopping to be had, too, and I ended up getting seduced into buying what looked like Ugg knockoffs at this cute store called Tamar (R. António Barbosa Viana 14 16, 8600-677), which stocks a ton of locally made merch like straw bags and ceramic housewares. Then, our next stop was just outside town: Ponta de Piedade, these golden rock formations jutting out of the water. We did attempt to scamper around some of them. It got a bit wild so I would suggest wearing sturdy, comfortable shoes.\n\nIf you don’t want to stay at a big resort like we did, I would recommend the stylish Casa Māe (R. do Jogo da Bola 41, 8600-712) here in Lagos.\n\n8 p.m.: Order a local fish platter\n\nVila Vita’s Japanese restaurant had a platter of different types of local fish, most of it was white fish, but they also had salmon and tuna that were sourced from the Azores. The chef even showed us the tags of the fish. We tossed these back with vodka martinis.\n\nDay 4\n\n10 a.m.: Sail around the Algarve\n\nWhen we were figuring out what we wanted to do on this trip, we knew we really wanted to rent a boat, and that’s one of the main reasons we booked Vila Vita; they have a yacht. The rate is around $1,000 for a full day, and you can have up to 8 people on the boat.\n\nOur captains were spectacular. They’ve been doing this for 30 years. But in addition to all that experience, they had such a great sense of humor. They were telling us all these crazy stories about the people they’ve taken on tours — including some pretty famous names. We had a couple of bottles of white wine, some grilled veggies, and, of course, pasteis de nata, the iconic egg custards. And then for several hours, we sailed around the coast visiting some of the Algarve’s most jaw-dropping spots.\n\nWe stopped at a bunch of different places: Praia de Carvoeiro, Marinha Beach, Arco Natural. But the best part was touring the 50-odd caves that are just outside the fishing village of Benagil. Our captains threw us into this dingy, and from there we just went exploring. It was kind of intense to see them maneuver this little thing in and out of tiny spaces as the tide was coming up and down, and you really think you’re going to run into these caves. And some of the caves would be totally pitch black while others would be bright and blue and there was one with a giant hole that looked up to the sky.\n\nYou can drive to all these different sights, of course, but the perspective you get from the water is just unbelievable. It was one of the highlights of our trip. I’ll never forget it.\n\n5 p.m.: Arrive at a fancy farm hotel\n\nAfter a full day out at sea, we couldn’t wait to retreat to our next hotel, Vila Monte Farm House (Calicos Site, 8700-069), which is located in the eastern half of the Algarve. Very close to the border with Spain, this part of the country is entirely less manicured than the western side, which is where a lot of the big luxury resorts are. But Vila Monte is just fabulous. The property, which is surrounded by fragrant olive groves, citrus trees, and the shocking pink of bougainvillea, is mostly white with these stunning pops of blues and greens. It’s very serene and rustic-chic. The pools were beautiful, too. It really looked like it was plucked out of Ojai.\n\nFor dinner, we decided to stay at the hotel. We ordered some beautifully grilled fish, and they also had fantastic pizza. Plus, you can drink your cocktails out on the lawn — paradise for two New Yorkers.\n\nDay 5\n\n9 a.m.: Stretch before breakfast\n\nThe hotel offers a lot of daily activities. So we woke up early to take Pilates and then enjoyed a lovely breakfast of local Portuguese fruits, charcuterie, some fantastic bread, and every nut milk you can imagine.\n\n1 p.m.: People-watch in the plaza\n\nIt takes less than two hours to drive the entire width of Portugal’s southern coast, but there are so many adorable places to visit. We started as far east as possible in Vila Real de Santo António, which is right on the border of Spain. It’s designed like a mini Lisbon and has this beautiful plaza that’s perfect for people-watching. We strolled around, marveling at the collection of buildings covered in gorgeous tiles of blues and greens. We popped into A Loja da Maria (Rua Jornal do Algarve 63), a home decor shop where we found ceramics that looked almost spotted in a cool tie-dye way. Then we drove to Altura, which reminded us a bit of a sleepy Jersey Shore town: It’s a very chill place, great for walking along the beach picking up seashells along the way.\n\n4 p.m.: Snack on French cheese and Portuguese wine\n\nOur last stop was Tavira, which is one of the more popular towns in eastern Algarve. The waterside promenade and beautifully manicured gardens make Tavira stand out from neighboring towns; they make it feel bigger, grander than a beach town, like you’re in a small-but-historic European city.\n\nWe were just scoping out the scene on foot, and Tchin-Cheese (R. da Liberdade 24, 8800-329) caught our eye. It’s a cute little wine-and-cheese shop (maybe four tables) from a French expat. It felt so different from any other restaurant that we had eaten at in Portugal up to that point. We got to chatting with the owner, who picked out a cheese platter and some natural local wines for us to try. Yes, a cheese-and-wine pairing is so trite, but it’s my favorite thing in the world, and we really vibed with the owner, whose taste is out of this world. We sat with him outside for longer than we expected. But when he recommended O Tonel (R. Dr. Augusto da Silva Carvalho 6, 8800-650) for a dinner of simply prepared octopus and more Portuguese white wine, we happily obliged.\n\nAriel’s Portugal packing list\n\nNike Air Force 1 ‘07 From $90 From $90 In this modern day, you can wear a pair of white Air Force 1s to dinner or when you’re out scaling rock formations in southern Portugal.

    "The goats of Portugal": "By Marilyn Sheridan, in Portugal, Environment, Curiosity · 24 Sep 2022, 17:01 · 1 Comments\n\nGoats were among the first animals to be domesticated over 10,000 years ago, with well over 200 domestic breeds now bred in the world. Goats play a major role both in commercial and independent farming, particularly in tropical, subtropical and Mediterranean regions where they are crucial for the supply of meat, milk, fibre and even dung.\n\nUsually goats are docile, even in the wild, but will protect themselves by kicking, fainting, or head-butting predators. They also have a secret talent few people know about - they are powerful and fast swimmers! Male goats, called bucks or billys, usually have a beard, females are called does or nannys, and their young are called kids. They are ruminants (chew their cud), with special four-compartment stomachs especially designed to digest roughage such as grass, hay and silage. They have cloven hooves, meaning that the hoof is split into two main hooves that work independently of each other.\n\nGoats Don’t Eat Everything!\n\nGoats have a reputation for eating everything, including tin cans, but this is untrue. If they chew on a can, they probably aren’t actually chewing on the metal but more likely eating the label and the glue on the label - the label is like eating leaves off a tree and the glue is a sweet treat to them. When it comes to normal foraging, they won’t eat just any old thing, but can be rather fussy, picky eaters, and can be meticulous about what type of weeds, grasses and hay they will consume.\n\nGoats and Fire\n\nIt’s common to see herds of goats slowly munching their way through the beautiful Portuguese countryside but they can have a crucial role - by eating the dry vegetation in rural regions, they could help create firebreaks, thus aiding protection against the spread of forest fires. June this year marked five years since the deadliest fires on record in Portugal, responsible for 66 deaths around the town of Pedrógão Grande alone. Part of Portugal’s problem, as in other southern European countries, is that inland villages have shed their populations, and the absence of shepherds, goatherds and farmers has left forest lands overgrown, allowing fires to spread and burn faster. Steep slopes are out of reach for a tractor and are very costly to tend by hand, particularly for an ageing population.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoat food facts\n\nGoat production in Portugal is around 32,000 farms, and 420,000 animals have been identified, which translates to an average of 13 animals per farm. Goat farms reveal a greater milk tendency than sheep farms, and Portugal’s most famous goat’s cheese is Serra da Estrela cheese - famous for its creamy texture and intense smell. It hails from the highest mountain range in mainland Portugal, an area traditionally known for pastoral farming. Goat meat is healthier than other meats, having around two-thirds the calories of beef and three-quarters the calories of chicken. It also has a third of the fat of pork and less than half the fat of chicken. The best of flavours come out when they are slow-cooked, with the taste and flavours changing as the goat matures. Young goats taste the best with tender meat and a less ‘gamey’ taste.\n\nThe Serrana breed is the most important indigenous goat breed from Portugal and furthermore was exported to other regions of the world, notably South America during Portuguese colonisation.\n\nThe six most popular Portugal goats are Cabrito das Terras Altas do Minho, Cabrito do Alentejo, Cabrito da Gralheira, Cabrito de Barroso, Cabrito da Beira and lastly Cabrito Transmontano.\n\nAround the world, goat meat is the most widely consumed red meat, and worldwide, goat’s milk is even more popular than cow's milk, with one goat producing an average of a gallon and a half of milk a day - more than enough in a developing country for one family - takes up less space and needs less food than a cow. Goat’s milk is less likely to cause lactose intolerance and is easier to digest than cow’s milk, it contains less fat and is naturally homogenised. The popularity shows no signs of slowing down either. Goat is the fastest growing segment of the worldwide livestock industry.",
    "Brits to receive post-Brexit residency cards by end of year": "Minister predicts 36,000 Brits will have residency card by 2023\n\nPortugal’s Minister of Internal Administration said today that he expects the 36,000 British citizens living in Portugal to have the new post-Brexit residence card by the end of the year.\n\n“By December 31, we really hope to have responded to these 36,000 British citizens,” José Luís Carneiro said during a visit to the British citizens’ service desk at the Lisbon regional office of the immigration and borders service (SEF).\n\nWith two counters exclusively for Brits, the new post in Lisbon is the fifth to open in the country for the collection of biometric data for the issue of the new residence permit, under the agreement of the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union.\n\nThis phase of the process started in February in the autonomous regions of the Azores and Madeira and from July in the municipalities of Cascais and Loulé, with two other posts scheduled to open in October in Porto and Quarteira.\n\n“We are fulfilling the commitments we have made, with a view to guaranteeing the rights, freedoms and guarantees of British citizens who seek our country as a country of residence, investment, and living,” the minister told journalists.\n\nFollowing the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union, British citizens already living in Portugal when the transition period ended at the end of 2020 were able to apply for a new residence permit. By September, there were around 36,000 registered applications.\n\nMeanwhile, and until the definitive card is issued, British citizens have a provisional document issued when they register on the SEF’s Brexit Portal, in digital format with a QR code that serves as an official residence document.\n\nHowever, according to José Luís Carneiro, this document does not ensure the right to access Portugal’s national health service, the services of the tax authority and the ministry of labour, solidarity and social security, nor the right of movement within the Schengen area.\n\n“This service point aims to respond to that need,” he added.\n\nThe minister also announced the opening of 13 more service points for British citizens from next month, in coordination with the Agency for Administrative Modernisation (AMA) and the Institute of Registration and Notary Affairs (IRN).\n\nThe new posts will open in Lisbon, Faro, Marinha Grande, Pombal, Coimbra, Castelo Branco, Porto, Seixal, Santarém, Beja and Lagos.\n\nQuestioned as to whether they will be permanent posts, the interior minister began by stating that at the moment “a very specific response” is being created.\n\nHe also said this experience of extending the SEF response to the IRN, to the municipalities, as well as to the AMA Citizen Spaces, will “allow us to extend the posts to the entire country, from the municipalities, where immigrant citizens can go to deal with their essential documents”.\n\nAlso present at the visit, the British consul in Portugal, Simona Demuro, said that the opening of the post in Lisbon is a “very important” step that will allow many British citizens living in the country to obtain the new residence card.\n\nSource: Lusa",
    "Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal comments show Erik ten Hag has a Manchester United weapon to use": "Get the latest on new manager Erik ten Hag, transfers and United team news delivered straight to your inbox every day for free\n\nThey are the type of numbers that seem inconceivable at first glance. Then you remember we are talking about one of the greatest players in the history of the game.\n\nBy the time the World Cup comes around in two months, Cristiano Ronaldo will be on the cusp of 200 caps for his beloved Portugal — not to mention more than 100 goals. When it comes to representing his country, there is no question of his importance to the side, even though he is less than five months out from turning 38.\n\nWhile all is rosy on the international front, the superstar has been in the headlines for the wrong type of reasons. Namely, the summer-long saga involving his future at Manchester United.\n\nRead more: Neves gives Ronaldo verdict amid United speculation\n\nThe whole episode did not cover him in any glory and understandably a portion of United fans are keen for him to be shipped off in January if possible. Many wanted him gone as soon as it was made aware he wished to leave in the summer. Whatever the reasons behind it, it didn't happen and he's stayed put.\n\nThat is not to say he cannot play his part this season and, who knows, maybe even further beyond that.\n\nErik ten Hag has so far been content to use Ronaldo sporadically, with just one league start since he walked in the door (albeit there was the caveat of him missing pre-season due to a personal issue).\n\nBut given the fixture congestion that lies ahead, the Dutchman will surely be banking on being able to call upon Ronaldo on a more consistent basis as the season goes on. At 37, he does not have the luxury of being able to wait around months. He needs game time to build fitness for the World Cup, and if that means Europa League matches or Nations League assignments for his country then so be it.\n\nSome have questioned his commitment to the cause but you only have to look at his stance when it comes to Portugal duty. Ronaldo rarely, if ever, shirks call-ups and a measure of his desire to continue playing at the highest level was evident with his latest comments. He was asked whether the upcoming World Cup in Qatar was likely to be his swansong with his country and his answer was unequivocally clear.\n\n\"It has been a long road, but I would like to say that my road is not over yet. (You're going to have to) take a little more road from me,\" said Ronaldo.\n\n\"I hope to be part of the federation (team) for a few more years. I still feel motivated; my ambition is high. I'm in a team with young people. I want to be part of this World Cup and the European too; I'm going to assume that right away.\"\n\nHis longevity, in terms of consistently performing at the highest levels in the sport, may never be witnessed again.\n\nWhile he may not be the player United had first time around, or even the one we saw last year, you should never rule him out. The fire is clearly still burning deep within.\n\nREAD NEXT:",
    "Over 250 new supermarkets opened in Portugal": "Portuguese food distribution ended 2021 with a new boost both in its sales room for consumer products (PGC) and in the number of stores, according to the latest report on the sector published by Alimarket.\n\nBy TPN, in News, Business, Portugal · 25 Sep 2022, 16:10 · 0 Comments\n\nAt the end of the year, the sector had added 257 new points of sale to the commercial fabric of the country, which recorded a growth of 3.8% in the commercial area.\n\nDespite being a highly concentrated market, in which the first four operators by sales bring together 67.6% and half of the stores, Portuguese distribution still presents growth opportunities for chains. Proof of this are the active expansion plans of many of the distributors, who seek to strengthen themselves in the areas in which they are already present, in addition to gaining access to new districts in which they do not yet operate.\n\nAldi growth\n\nThe Portuguese distribution continues to be led by MC Sonae, which at the end of the year was more than six points away from the local group Jerónimo Martins. Although both added more than 20,000 m2 to their commercial fabric, the growth of the German chain Aldi stands out, which led the openings by area and climbed one position in the general ranking, reaching seventh place.",
    "Over 50% of Portuguese trust traditional media": "Portugal is one of the European countries where traditional media is most trusted.\n\nBy TPN, in News, Portugal · 25 Sep 2022, 14:03 · 2 Comments\n\nAccording to the Marco Research: Post Covid Consumer Behavior study, developed by the Marco agency — and which, in Europe, analyses Portugal, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Spain — 61% of Portuguese people trust television news, the same percentage that trust radio, while 57% and 53% trust news in print and online, respectively.\n\nAfter Portugal, the United Kingdom, Germany and France are the countries in which the population trusts television the most, with Spain and Italy already, albeit by a small margin, in negative territory in terms of this indicator.\n\nPortugal also ranks first in terms of trust in online press, paper press and radio.

For 65% of Portuguese people, WhatsApp is the most frequently consulted channel to access information, followed by Instagram (51%) and Facebook (48%).\n\n“These are key conclusions as they show how the Portuguese and European media landscapes are adapting to changes and how traditional media continue to reinvent themselves.

    "Spain agrees not to cut water to Portugal": "Spain will maintain the flow of water from rivers to Portugal and respect the flows agreed bilaterally, according to the delegate of the Spanish Government in the region of Castile and Leon, Virgínia Barcones.\n\nBy TPN/Lusa, in News, Portugal, Europe · 22 Sep 2022, 18:03 · 3 Comments\n\n\"Spain is a serious state that abides by the international agreements it signs,\" Virgínia Barcones said, in response to questions from journalists in the Spanish city of León, quoted by the EFE news agency.\n\nVirgínia Barcones recalled that this matter is regulated by the Albufeira Convention, signed by Portugal and Spain 24 years ago, and that the country must fulfil the agreement.\n\nOn Monday, around 3,000 farmers from the provinces of León, Zamora and Salamanca demonstrated in the city centre of León to demand an end to the release of water to Portugal under the Albufeira agreement.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Portuguese Minister for the Environment and Climate Action said that the Portuguese Environment Agency (APA) holds “permanent meetings” with Spanish counterparts on drought within the scope of existing conventions between the two countries.\n\nDifficult year\n\n“Portugal is having a very difficult year, Spain is having a very difficult year. We are aware that both countries are being affected by the drought issue. There have been permanent meetings between the APA and Spanish counterparts regarding the monitoring of responsibilities under the existing conventions. We will always defend our country for the best use and respect for conventions”, said Duarte Cordeiro, during a hearing in parliament.\n\nThe minister said that “the existing difficulties on either side will be evaluated”, recalling that in the summer there was always “a very complicated situation regarding the Tagus”.\n\n“We had the opportunity to draw Spain's attention to this, to reinforce the flows”, he added, noting that, from the point of view of the Albufeira Convention, there are daily, monthly and annual flows, and “short-term flows have been fulfilled”.",
    "Vila Valverde Design & Country Hotel undergoes complete refurbishment": "Vila Valverde Design & Country Hotel has recently undergone a complete refurbishment inspired by the landscapes of the region\n\nVila Valverde Design & Country Hotel opened in 2004 in Praia da Luz, built on a fully renovated 19th-century manor house, on a five-hectare property with an enchanting view over the bay. The orchards, the spring, the small lake with carps and the spacious gardened areas reveal a building with only 15 rooms, but a whole range of services that make this place special, far from large tourist centres, but very close to the best that the Algarve has to offer.\n\nArchitect Mário Martins was responsible for transforming the farm into one of the six five-star rural hotels in Portugal, opting for a play of colours, straight lines for the furniture and the functionality of the spaces.\n\nThis year a new challenge was set, and Nini Andrade Silva was the interior designer chosen by the owner, Luís Tavares, to redecorate the entire hotel unit, with an investment of half a million euros. “She is a professional with a proven track record all over the world and she accepted this challenge. We usually renovate the property every two years, because we know it’s necessary to keep up with progress. But, we felt that this was the moment to make the atmosphere even more refined, intimate and exclusive,” he explains.\n\nThe beaches and mountains of the Algarve served as the motto for the transformation, where the once bright colours gave way to soft and neutral tones that can be seen in the finishes, furniture and decoration to bring the surrounding landscape into the hotel. This is a perfect symbiosis to provide an even calmer and more relaxing stay, which was replicated in all the common areas, the rooms and the exterior area of the main building. But there was more to the renovations than just the aesthetics.\n\nThe traditional buffet breakfast is now served à la carte, “so that guests have a more personalised offer that meets their morning cravings”. For dinner, chef João Branco is in charge of the restaurant menu. Featuring traditional Portuguese food “with a very modern twist”, the menu also caters to vegan and vegetarian preferences. Vila Verde also has a great wine cellar filled with Portuguese wines.\n\nAccording to Luís Tavares, the aim is “to give guests the opportunity to have everything available in one place”. In addition to the outdoor and indoor heated pools, another of the hotel’s secrets is the wellness centre, with a massage room, Turkish and Japanese baths, sauna and even a solarium.\n\nThere are dozens of treatments carried out by the hands of physiotherapists and masseurs, from relaxing massages, lymphatic drainage and foot reflexology to peelings, masks, thermotherapy and light therapy.\n\nGiven the hotel’s privileged location, surrounded by various golf courses, all guests can enjoy this sport and choose one of the six courses where they would like to improve their skills: Palmares (Odiáxere), Boavista Golf, (Lagos), Espiche Golf (Lagos), Santo António Golf (Vila do Bispo), Salgados Golf (Guia) and Álamos Golf (Portimão). The team can also organise tennis matches, bike rides, horse riding, sailing, diving or excursions to various parts of the country and even Spain.\n\nAnother aspect where this hotel stands out is its concern for sustainability. For several years now, Vila Valverde Design & Country Hotel has been honoured with the Green Key for Sustainable Tourism, a certificate awarded by the European Union. “There’s no plastic anywhere, we have 350 solar panels that allow us to produce around 70% of all our electricity and we have a water mine. We have a vegetable garden where we grow all the vegetables we use at the hotel and several fruit trees (lemon, orange, peach and fig trees). We don’t use chlorine in our swimming pools and the surplus water is used for irrigation,” explains the owner.\n\nFocusing on well-being, attention to detail and personalised services, the hotel can accommodate up to 30 guests at the same time, and children under the age of 10 are not allowed.\n\nBy MARIA SIMIRIS"
