    "Pakistan’s Biblical Floods and the Case for Climate Reparations": "We have tried, in various ways, to convey to the world the scale of destruction caused by recent floods in Pakistan, because, apparently, a third of the country underwater and thirty-three million lives upended doesn’t cut it. Pakistan’s climate minister has called it Biblical. We have shot and shared videos in which the landmark New Honeymoon Hotel crumbles in the duration of a TikTok. The U.N. Secretary-General, António Guterres, who is seventy-three and has called the climate crisis a “code red for humanity,” visited Pakistan and said that he hadn’t seen this scale of climate carnage in his life. Some of us have created maps showing that the areas underwater are larger than Britain. We have shown pictures of dead and starving cattle to appeal to animal-lovers. We have posted videos of puppies being heroically rescued from rushing waters.\n\nMaybe when the world seems to be ending, it needs poets. A poet in Khairpur, in southern Pakistan, one of the worst-affected areas, was asked by a journalist if he had received a tent to shelter his family. He found the idea so improbable that he asked, “Why are you making fun of me? Why would anyone give me a tent?” Pakistanis are saying that charity tents and emergency supplies are welcome, but what we need and want is compensation for climate-related loss and damage. Although much of the world seems to agree in principle, there is a we-have-all-heard-this-before weariness in the air. Our innovative communications have little impact. The U.S. has offered fifty million dollars and “long-term” support, the U.N. has appealed for a hundred and sixty million, France has offered to hold a donors’ conference, Angelina Jolie has flown in and said that she’s never seen such devastation. President Biden casually mentioned at the U.N. General Assembly that Pakistan “needs help,” without any specifics. This all sounds like a lot until you remember that Pakistan’s losses are estimated to be around thirty billion dollars.\n\nExperts have pointed out that this is not the kind of flood that causes weeks of havoc and then leaves behind fertile lands. Six months from now, flooded fields still may not be ready for cultivation. Most people affected by the floods live off the land, from crop to crop. Waterborne diseases and food shortages are already rampant. Climate scientists who have studied Pakistani floods have concluded that they can only predict more unpredictability.\n\nScientists are clear, however, that the catastrophe in Pakistan is linked to global warming. Pakistan generates less than one per cent of the world’s carbon emissions. We are quite good at blaming ourselves and our governments for our misfortunes, but global warming is overwhelmingly caused by rich folks living thousands of miles away, mostly in the West, by people who know that their air-conditioned homes and midsize cars and Caribbean holidays have snatched away the home and livelihood of someone in a village in Pakistan.\n\nThe West sees its culpability in this man-made disaster but prefers to blame the victim. I think of a fable that I grew up with, in which a lamb drinks from a river downstream until a lion accuses it of polluting the river upstream. In the version of the fable that I remember, the lion eats the lamb as punishment. Imagine this: the driver of an S.U.V. speeds into a country lane, hits a person on a bicycle, and then, instead of paying damages, asks the cyclist to drive an electric vehicle powered by renewable energy. The driver of the S.U.V. wonders why the cyclist wasn’t more resilient, and asks, “Why didn’t you plan for a future where my car might come and destroy your bicycle and break your leg? You could have prepared for a better future, for apocalyptic floods, but what did you do? You prepared a petition for reparations? And you don’t even have a practical plan for how these reparations would work?”\n\nThose calling for climate reparations received an answer from America’s climate envoy, John Kerry, at the U.N. General Assembly last week. “You tell me the government in the world that has trillions of dollars, ’cause that’s what it costs,” he said, perhaps steeling himself for difficult questions at November’s global climate conference, COP27, in Egypt. Western governments do have trillions of dollars, and they have had more than a decade to think through how climate reparations should work. Kerry sounded like he was haggling over the price of life jackets with drowning people.\n\nMaybe Pakistan could have handled the current floods better if we had done our homework. We had a massive flood in 2010, experts were flown in, reports and studies were commissioned and then shelved. But Pakistan, like its Western allies, had other priorities: we were busy in neighboring Afghanistan, helping America defeat the Taliban, or maybe helping the Taliban defeat America—we are still not sure. On the other border, we were busy with India. Even in the week of our Biblical floods, we managed to finalize a deal with the United States worth four hundred and fifty million dollars, to upgrade our F-16 fighter planes. We may not know how we are going to feed our people for the next six months, but we have made sure that we can keep them safe from hostile aircraft.\n\nLike Westerners, Pakistani élites planned for security and progress. We turned agricultural lands into golf courses and gated communities, and built houses on riverbeds, and grew cash crops along waterways. We thought less about the millions who live in mud houses, who till someone else’s land to feed their kids and save a bit in hopes of sending them to school one day. Now the water has turned their houses back into mud, and washed away the grain that they stocked for the entire year, and flooded the land that still belongs to someone else. They dare not dream of justice, let alone climate justice.\n\nExperts tell us that the world suffers from donor fatigue, what with a war in Ukraine, in which people with fair skin and blue eyes are fleeing their homes and fighting for their lives. What goes unsaid is that hearts have been hardened by repeated images of brown mothers cradling skeletal children who are covered in flies, along overflowing rivers or scorched fields. Or maybe rich nations think that they should save their money for when the disasters come for them.\n\nSometimes my own compatriots tell the world, If you don’t listen, it could happen to you. The West seems unfazed by this logic: climate carnage has happened there, is happening there. Perhaps the West fears that if it acknowledges any debt to a country like Pakistan, it will no longer be able to withhold what it owes its own citizens. A childhood friend lived in Lake Charles, Louisiana, for most of his life, and in the span of a year his house and business were destroyed thrice, first by Hurricane Laura, then snow, then flooding. He reluctantly put his house up for sale, moved to Los Angeles, and slowly started to build a life. The aid that the government promised to Lake Charles hasn’t arrived. After Hurricane Maria, hundreds of thousands of Americans in Puerto Rico were denied federal assistance. They were still vulnerable when Hurricane Fiona brought floods and blackouts again, this week. The lamb does not escape the lion by showing a U.S. passport.\n\nA global climate movement has made people aware of their carbon footprint, of the impact of their eating habits, of the evils of fossil-fuel companies, but it has yet to convince people that they and their governments can and should pay for what they helped to destroy. They must, because the losses and damages will only grow, and because the West became rich from the burning of fossil fuels, and because the village that is drowning may one day be their own.\n\nWhen rich nations refuse to acknowledge that countries such as Pakistan need climate reparations, they not only shirk their responsibility now but set a precedent of inaction and impunity, even within their own borders. They seem to say, We can build walls so high that the polluted air will only poison you. When it melts glaciers, only you will drown, and when your fields are flooded, only you will go hungry. We can give you a few thousand tents to shelter your millions, or rafts to float you over what used to be self-sustaining villages, but we don’t owe you anything. If it happens to us, rich countries seem to say, we won’t starve. We can always eat you. ♦",

    "Pakistan Floods Raise Fears of Hunger After Crops Wrecked": "Nearly 15 percent of its rice crop and 40 percent of its cotton crop were lost due to the floods.\n\nVillager women empty their cotton-filled shawls on a pile after collecting it from cotton crops, which were damaged by floodwaters due to heavy monsoon rains, in Tando Jam near Hyderabad, a district of southern Sindh province, Pakistan, Saturday, September 17, 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike every year, Arz Mohammed had planted his little patch of land in southern Pakistan with cotton. The crop would earn him enough so that, as he puts it, his family of five wouldn’t be reduced to begging. Then came the deluge.\n\nPakistan’s massive floods this summer collapsed Mohammed’s home and destroyed his four acres of cotton, wiping out most of his income.\n\nOn top of that, his land and that of his neighbors remain underwater, three months after the heaviest rains stopped. Like many farmers across southern Pakistan, he may not be able to plant his next crop — wheat — in time.\n\nThat could spell trouble for the country’s food supply.\n\nDiplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. Get the Newsletter\n\n“These rains have destroyed everything for us,” said Mohammed, who lives in a tent with his wife and children near his wrecked house in Khairpur, one of the country’s hardest-hit districts. “We don’t even have anything to eat.”\n\nEnjoying this article?

Just $5 a month.\n\nThis summer’s flooding, caused by monsoon rains nearly triple the usual ferocity, wiped out huge swaths of crops, leaving already impoverished families struggling to obtain food. Farmers and officials warn that Pakistan could now face serious food shortages at a time when the government is strapped for cash and world food prices are high.\n\nNearly 15 percent of Pakistan’s rice crop and 40 percent of its cotton crop were lost, according to officials. The waters also wiped out the personal grain stores that many farming families rely on for food yearlong.\n\nThe flooding, blamed in part on climate change, killed nearly 1,600 people, damaged nearly 2 million homes and overall wreaked damage estimated at more than $30 billion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the United Nations last week, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif told The Associated Press that crops on 4 million acres were washed away. “We need funds to provide a livelihood to our people. We need funds to compensate for the loss of crops to our people, to our farmers.”\n\nThe government says there is no immediate worry about food supplies. In a statement to the AP, the state disaster agency said wheat stock is enough to last through the next harvest and that the government is importing more.\n\nHowever, the upcoming wheat crop has been thrown into uncertainty. Planting usually starts in October. In Punjab province, the country’s main wheat producer, fields suffered less damage and can be sown in time. But in southern Sindh province, the second largest producer, some 50 percent of the fields remain underwater, according to Jam Khan Shoro, a provincial irrigation minister in Sindh.\n\nAerial footage in Sindh shows field after field still inundated. The province, in Pakistan’s southern lowlands at the downstream end of its major rivers, is where the floods hit hardest: 80 percent of the rice crop and 70 percent of cotton were destroyed, devastating the livelihoods of the small farmers who make up most the production.\n\nAltaf Hussain Marri, a larger and relatively well-off landholder in Khairpur, said he normally gives away wheat as a gift to friends and family. Now he’s worried about having enough for himself and his children, unsure if his 400 inundated acres will drain in time. The floods demolished his cotton and rice crops, worth around $40,000.\n\n“If we fail to grow wheat … next year we might not have even wheat to eat,” Marri said. “It will create food insecurity in the country. The poor will suffer a lot. There will be no flour.”\n\nPakistan’s agricultural sector had been growing in recent years, allowing the country to export some wheat and rice.\n\nEnjoying this article?

Just $5 a month.\n\n“Now we will have to import wheat and other food items,” Pakistan’s Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal told the AP.\n\nSharif, the prime minister, said Pakistan may have to import about a million metric tons of wheat, and it could come from Russia, but Pakistan is open to other offers if the price is right.\n\nPakistan has already put out orders to import 500,000 metric tons of wheat, Planning Ministry officials say. There are contingency plans to buy as much as 2.5 million tons over the next year, but officials are waiting to see how much wheat is planted, they said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the policy was not yet set.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAshfaq Ahmad, a senior economist, said the additional wheat needs to be brought in quickly, by next month.\n\nOtherwise, “I am seeing a food crisis in December,” he told the AP. “Any delay in the import of wheat will cause a food shortage.”\n\nThe flooding was also a blow to Pakistan’s important cash crops. Losses will mean lower exports of rice, which earned $2 billion in 2020. Cotton losses could hurt the country’s biggest export, textiles and clothes, which brought in more than $20 billion annually in recent years.\n\nBut the greater damage and danger are likely to Pakistan’s poor, with no margin to endure losses in income and food.\n\nIn Dasht, a remote district of Baluchistan province, hundreds of orchard owners worry about their future after losing crops of grapes, apples and other fruits. In parts of Baluchistan, piles upon piles of rotten apples can be seen in submerged areas.\n\nEven before the floods, some 38 million Pakistanis, more than 16 percent of the population, were living in moderate or severe food insecurity, meaning they were uncertain about being able to obtain food or at times have outright gone without eating, according to the World Health Organization. Nearly 18 percent of children were acutely malnourished.\n\nThe blow to the food supply and incomes will tip those populations deeper into hunger, U.N. agencies have warned. The U.N.’s World Food Program has so far delivered food to 600,000 flood survivors.\n\nIqbal, the planning minister, said Sindh province is the country’s biggest producer of vegetables for domestic markets. Those crops were lost, along with families’ personal stores of grains for themselves and feed for their livestock.\n\n“So, therefore we have a real food security challenge at hand,” he said.\n\nOn the ground in Sukkur, another hard-hit district neighboring Khairpur, the local agricultural director Rasool Bux Junejo fears the worst. Farmers won’t be able to grow wheat or other key crops like sunflowers and mustard.\n\n“That will be a huge loss in the coming months. If you ask me as an agriculture worker, I foresee famine, God forbid,” he said. “We will be unable to provide food to our people.”",

The $2bn figure includes that amount.\n\nOver the past two months, Pakistan has sent nearly 10,000 doctors, nurses and other medical staff to tend to survivors in Sindh province – the worst affected by the floods.\n\nIsmail, echoed by the prime minister, reassured investors on Friday that the South Asian nation was seeking debt relief from bilateral creditors and emphasised the government would not seek any relief from commercial banks or Eurobond creditors.",

    "Pakistan PM says ‘all hell will break loose’ without debt relief": "As Pakistan reels under an unprecedented flood crisis, Shehbaz Sharif appeals for debt relief and urges more help from the global community.\n\nIslamabad, Pakistan – Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif says “all hell will break loose” if his flood-ravaged country is not provided with debt relief by rich nations.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg TV on Friday morning, Sharif sought a moratorium on Pakistan’s debt repayment from the Paris Club (a group of rich creditor countries) and others, saying there is a “yawning gap” between what is being asked for and what is available.\n\n“We have requested (United Nations) secretary-general and European leaders to give us relief. How can the world expect us to stand on our own feet? It is simply impossible,” Sharif said in his interview, also aired on Pakistan’s state television.\n\nThere is primarily one argument I made in my interview with Bloomberg. Given the vast scale & extent of destruction caused by the floods, the rich countries should consider giving debt relief to Pakistan so that we can stand up on our feet. Climate disaster is not of our making. — Shehbaz Sharif (@CMShehbaz) September 23, 2022\n\nReferring to a visit to the flood-hit nation by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres earlier this month, Sharif said: “He saw this calamity with his own eyes. He said: ‘Prime Minister, it is unbelievable’. He is a man who has been dedicating his life for humanitarian causes for many years … He said he had never seen this kind of a climatic situation in his life.”\n\n“We are among the top 10 most vulnerable countries (to climate change),” he said.\n\nSharif again thanked US President Joe Biden for speaking about “Pakistan and our plight” at the United Nations General Assembly.\n\n“Many world leaders have discussed and openly said that Pakistan needs support more than ever and this shows sincerity of these leaders. But time is running out and we are racing against time,” he said.\n\nSharif is in New York for the annual UNGA, which he is expected to address later on Friday. He has already met several world leaders as part of his appeal to the international community to help Pakistan as it reels from unprecedented floods.\n\n“What the world has done is commendable but it is far from meeting our needs. We can’t do it alone,” Sharif said in the interview.\n\nThe floods in Pakistan, triggered by record monsoon rains and melting glaciers, have affected 33 million people, killed nearly 1,600 people and destroyed more than a million homes. The stagnant floodwaters have raised concerns of a “second disaster” as waterborne diseases have killed more than 300 people so far.\n\nThe government last month estimated the total loss at $30bn, creating concerns that Pakistan will not be able to repay $1bn in international bonds by December.\n\nSharif’s appeal for aid came amid a report by the Financial Times newspaper on Friday, which said the UN Development Programme (UNDP) has prepared a memo suggesting Pakistan should suspend its international debt repayments and restructure loans in the aftermath of the catastrophic floods.\n\nHowever, a top finance ministry official in Pakistan, requesting anonymity, rejected the report, telling Al Jazeera that “no such proposal is on the table as yet”.\n\nOfficials at Pakistan’s UNDP office did not respond to Al Jazeera queries about the memo. Questions to Pakistan’s finance ministry and other government officials also went unanswered.\n\nLate last month, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) released a long-stalled bailout package of $1.17bn, staving off a major economic disaster in Pakistan.\n\nThe IMF’s latest report says Pakistan’s total bilateral debt due in the next financial year is close to $7bn, almost 2 percent of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP). It also owes nearly $30bn to its close ally China – the amount making up roughly 30 percent of the country’s GDP.\n\nSharif, in his interview with Bloomberg TV, said he will “most definitely” request debt relief from China.\n\nPakistan’s debt crisis was also brought up by the UN’s Guterres on Tuesday in his opening remarks at the UNGA, where he urged global leaders to consider debt reduction mechanisms to help Pakistan.\n\n“These (mechanisms) could have saved lives and livelihoods in Pakistan, which is drowning not only in floodwater but also in debt,” Guterres said.\n\nExperts say there is a possibility that Pakistan’s bilateral debt will be restructured in the wake of the floods.\n\n“This will provide some breathing space for the country as any fund allocated to debt servicing can be reallocated to public welfare and the social sector,” economist Ammar H Khan told Al Jazeera.",
    "How the U.S. is helping Pakistan overcome severe floods": "The United States and partner organizations continue to provide support for Pakistan’s recovery from disastrous floods that have affected 33 million people.\n\nThe U.S. government has provided more than $56 million in flood relief and humanitarian assistance for Pakistan this year. More than $50 million of the assistance has come through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). The State Department provided an additional $2 million to support the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees’ response effort in Pakistan, and $1.4 million in Defense Department funding helped airlift supplies.\n\nThe funding helps provide food, drinking water, nutrition, sanitation, shelter assistance and other aid to the country, where heavy monsoon rains have caused flooding, landslides and glacial lake outbursts. Nearly 1,600 people have been killed and an estimated 12,900 injured, USAID said.\n\n“We’ll continue to provide assistance to our partners in this time of need,” State Department Spokesperson Ned Price said September 13, noting that U.S. and Pakistani officials have been working together to assess the damage.\n\nA USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team and Pakistan’s National Disaster Management Authority have worked together to assess damage and identify priority humanitarian needs.\n\nU.S., partners provide assistance\n\nU.S. assistance supports partners’ efforts to reduce hunger and disease risk after floods destroyed 1.8 million hectares of cropland and damaged sanitation systems.\n\nUSAID supports the U.N. World Food Programme’s distribution of food and cash assistance to buy food for approximately 341,500 people across Pakistan. The effort brings wheat, yellow split peas, vegetable oil, iodized salt and supplies to treat and prevent malnutrition.\n\nUSAID partner organization Concern Worldwide, headquartered in Dublin, is providing safe drinking water, hygiene items and water removal services for 283,000 people. “Concern is also providing shelter repair kits, tools, kitchen sets and plastic sheeting to help people whose houses have been damaged or destroyed,” USAID says.\n\nTo deliver assistance quickly, USAID asked that the Defense Department airlift supplies to hard-hit areas. U.S. Air Force cargo planes delivered nearly 630 metric tons of relief supplies from USAID’s warehouse in Dubai to Pakistan, completing the mission September 16.\n\nU.S. government–built schools have served as shelters for displaced people after floods damaged or destroyed more than 2 million homes.\n\n“The United States is deeply saddened for the flood victims and the loss of loved ones, livelihoods, and homes throughout Pakistan,” USAID said in a September 9 statement. “We stand with communities in Pakistan during this difficult time and will continue to help them in this time of need.”",

To date, more than 1,500 people have been killed, including 552 children.\n\nThe Prime Minister noted that some 33 million people are now at risk of health hazards; more than 13,000 kilometres of roads have been damaged; one million homes have been destroyed and another million damaged; and four million acres of crops have been washed away.\n\n“Pakistan has never seen a starker and more devastating example of the impact of global warming,” he stressed. “Life in Pakistan has changed forever.”\n\nOn his visit to the country earlier this month, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said he had never seen “climate carnage on this scale,” and called for urgent financial support to help Pakistan, saying it is not just a question of solidarity but a question of justice.\n\nThe Prime Minister noted: “Nature has unleashed her fury on Pakistan without looking at our carbon footprint, which is next to nothing. Our actions did not contribute to this.”\n\nHe added that the current priority is to ensure rapid economic growth and lift millions out of destitution, which requires a stable external environment.\n\nSustainable peace in South Asia\n\n“Sustainable peace and stability in South Asia, however, remains contingent upon a just and lasting solution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute. At the heart of this longstanding dispute lies the denial of the inalienable right of the Kashmiri people to self-determination,” he said.\n\nThe Prime Minister added that in a “classic settler-colonial project,” India is seeking to turn the Muslim-majority Jammu and Kashmir into a Hindu-majority territory through “illegal demographic changes.”\n\n“Millions of fake ‘domicile certificates’ have been issued to non-Kashmiris; Kashmiri land and properties are being seized; electoral districts have been gerrymandered; and over 2.5 million non-Kashmiri illegal voters fraudulently registered. All this is in blatant violation of Security Council resolutions and international law, particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention.”\n\nHe called on the United Nations and the Secretary-General to play their rightful role in urging India to implement existing UN resolutions on this issue.\n\nThe position of the UN on this region is governed by the UN Charter and applicable Security Council resolutions. The Secretary-General maintains that the final settlement of Jammu and Kashmir is to be reached by peaceful means, in accordance with the UN Charter and bilateral agreements.",

The latter is the oncoming pinnacle of human technology, while the former is a developing country, stuck in what seems to be a perpetual cycle of economic and geopolitical turmoil.

It’s like how the Internet emerged in the 1990s, through the interplay of rising consumer expectations, and the confluence of various technological advances in the decades before. Those same demand and supply forces are at work now. And while we’re beginning to sense traces of the Metaverse, our children will see it in full bloom.\n\nDon’t think of the Metaverse as merely a virtual twin of your existing life. Instead, consider it an array of alternative realities with unexpected possibilities and psychological effects. The Metaverse will change how humans interact with technology, with one another, and with the world. Ultimately, it will even upend the concept of what a world is.\n\nWhy does the Metaverse matter?\n\nIt matters because of the economic value up for grabs. I’ll illustrate with a comparison.\n\nThe advent of the Internet made most industries go “digital”. And now, 30 years later, about 15 per cent of the world economy is purely digital, while the remaining 85pc is digitally enhanced. So the Internet’s footprint is everywhere.\n\nExpect the Metaverse to take over the global economy at a comparable rate and in a similar timeframe.\n\nMoreover, if going digital was a big shift, this next one would be even bigger due to the increasing criticality of technology to economic activity. Some expect the Metaverse will generate more than 10 trillion dollars in value and tens of millions of new jobs.\n\nThe economic pie up for grabs is so enormous that the advent of the Metaverse will probably reshuffle the world order — among both the corporate world and governments. Amid this reshuffle will arise an opportunity for a developing country like Pakistan.\n\nPakistan’s entry into the Metaverse\n\nWhenever something has a strong demand, those best positioned to supply it get rewarded handsomely. So it pays to position yourself for a future that is approaching. This fundamental principle turned around the fortunes of many countries during the digital revolution — India and China being two notable examples from Pakistan’s neighbourhood.\n\nMany years ago, I proposed a menu of ambitious tech-related suggestions to Pakistani decision-makers. But my proposal was too expansive, requiring a lot of bandwidth and resources. Pakistan was not ready for it (nor is it ready yet). So taking note of that, I’ve tweaked my doctrine. I now believe Pakistan should consciously pull back and refocus exclusively on technologies shaping the future. Otherwise, it will be spreading itself too thin. In essence, being lightweight and focused is the need of the hour.\n\nSo in light of that, here are some suggestions for the Pakistani state:\n\nCreate a think tank: The state must understand more about the Metaverse before it can make effective policies. So first up, a dedicated think tank is needed. It will enable the government to consult relevant experts without exhaustive red tape. The think tank’s research and recommendations will help the state thoughtfully formulate an official policy.\n\nThe state must understand more about the Metaverse before it can make effective policies. So first up, a dedicated think tank is needed. It will enable the government to consult relevant experts without exhaustive red tape. The think tank’s research and recommendations will help the state thoughtfully formulate an official policy. Formulate a Metaverse policy: Why is this policy needed? Firstly, to take advantage of the upcoming Metaverse economy. Secondly, to regulate virtual experiences that could have harmful psychosomatic effects (for example, porn in virtual reality). And thirdly, to address data collection, usage, rights, and penalties. The Metaverse will capture much more user data than social media. Cameras, microphones, and sensors will record nearly every movement, every word, every expression, and much more in the Metaverse. Pakistan needs a Metaverse policy right away, before tech giants swoop in and goad government officials into signing contracts that enslave Pakistan’s virtual future on the pretext of globalisation.\n\nWhy is this policy needed?

Pakistan needs a Metaverse policy right away, before tech giants swoop in and goad government officials into signing contracts that enslave Pakistan’s virtual future on the pretext of globalisation. Incentivise service providers: Pakistan has a growing community of tech service providers. Their primary bread and butter is building websites and apps for foreign clients. Through sweeteners, the state can incentivise this developer community to start compiling a portfolio of Metaverse projects. This way, a critical mass of Pakistani service providers will ultimately attune themselves to the Metaverse tech stack, helping the country build a competitive advantage over time.\n\nPakistan has a growing community of tech service providers.

This way, a critical mass of Pakistani service providers will ultimately attune themselves to the Metaverse tech stack, helping the country build a competitive advantage over time. Align academia: Huge advances in computational resources, blockchains, bandwidth, networking, and AI-based optimisations are needed to make the Metaverse possible. Likewise, expertise in 3D and VR modelling, animations, and using APIs to create immersive 3D experiences is also growing in demand. Pakistani university curriculum and research should nurture these competencies among scholars. Accordingly, technology universities can be mandated to offer relevant courses, or at least one ‘Metaverse 101’ course. In case of a shortage of competent professors, a suitable online course or seminar can be made compulsory (for example, Stanford’s). A small start like this can someday snowball into a more meaningful curriculum upgrade as the Metaverse matures in the future.\n\nI’ve deliberately kept these recommendations simple and low-fidelity. Expecting costly overhauls is unrealistic, given Pakistan’s economic travails. So let’s take baby steps first and delay significant strides for later.\n\nMetaverse use cases for Pakistan\n\nSo which industries in Pakistan can benefit the most from Metaverse-related technology? An obvious answer is game development startups from Pakistan’s tech sector. But what about beyond the obvious? Let’s explore:\n\nEducation: Covid-19 enforced ‘Zoom School’ on the world, but we soon realised it couldn’t replace presence in the classroom. That’s where the Metaverse shines. Immersive virtual reality transcends video calls, making your dominant senses feel you are present in the virtual experience. I’ve seen jaws drop when people experience this for the first time. So making use of this effect, top-tier Pakistani universities can introduce a course or two taught directly in VR. For example, it could be a course with guest lecturers from around the world, giving unforgettably immersive, interactive lectures to scholars. Note that entry-level VR devices cost roughly as much as mid-range smartphones. So it isn’t unthinkable for top-tier Pakistani universities, colleges, or schools to procure a dozen VR devices for learning. In the short run, this move will differentiate these institutions from their competition. But in the long run, this will lay the foundation for such institutions to leverage the Metaverse in unforeseen ways.\n\nCovid-19 enforced ‘Zoom School’ on the world, but we soon realised it couldn’t replace presence in the classroom.

But in the long run, this will lay the foundation for such institutions to leverage the Metaverse in unforeseen ways. Real estate: The best way to illustrate this is via an example. In July, UAE’s largest real estate company Damac declared a $100 million investment in Metaverse technology. Damac’s GM explained the rationale behind this investment: “we sell AED 100 million monthly over Zoom calls without any immersive technology. With the Metaverse, we can sell AED 700-800 million a month to customers in California, New York, or Miami”. This rationale also partly applies to Pakistan, given how hungry Pakistan’s real estate sector is for overseas investment.\n\nThe best way to illustrate this is via an example.

We’re already seeing virtual fashion brands like ‘dressx’ making a mark and virtual influencers like ‘lilmiquela’ playing muse to fashion houses on Instagram. Pakistan has a burgeoning fashion scene, with designers gaining international traction over the years. Expanding into virtual fashion and influencers will open up new revenue streams for such designers, helping create a reputation for innovation among their international clientele.\n\nAs the Metaverse takes off, so will virtual fashion.

Expanding into virtual fashion and influencers will open up new revenue streams for such designers, helping create a reputation for innovation among their international clientele. Defence and security: Pakistan has an established combat aircraft programme with a growing export market that virtual reality simulators will further stimulate. Equally, engineers at organisations such as the Institute of Optronics would do well to integrate augmented reality (AR) capabilities in the night and thermal vision gear they’re developing. There’s also massive potential for AR-enriched training systems, ranging from traditional combat training to anti-terrorism exercises. The tech created will eventually have export potential, apart from virtuously spilling over to the local economy. I realise that military research is classified; perhaps the Pakistani defence sector is already working on these concepts.\n\nPakistan has an established combat aircraft programme with a growing export market that virtual reality simulators will further stimulate.

I realise that military research is classified; perhaps the Pakistani defence sector is already working on these concepts. Tourism: Imagine 3D videos and immersive VR that depict flying like a bird over valleys in Gilgit-Baltistan, virtually climbing Himalayan peaks, or experiencing the best camping sites in Pakistan. Such technology will let anyone in the world experience a slice of Pakistan’s natural beauty from the comfort of their home. Marketing like that will naturally pique a lot of interest and vigorously feed Pakistan’s tourism. Remember that tourism promotion is usually tax-funded, so the government must take the lead and engage private sector solution providers for such Metaverse projects.\n\nCrisis relief: Pakistan is no stranger to natural disasters and humanitarian crises. Donations are critical in such cases; however, donor fatigue is increasing by the day. The Metaverse can help with this. It can allow potential donors experience the horrors of the calamity firsthand as if they are there. Grab a VR headset and experience life in a Syrian refugee camp via Clouds over Sidra to see what I mean. There is currently a growing body of academic work and psychology experiments that verify the empathy-inducing effects of this technology. Pakistani disaster relief operators should take note.\n\nPakistan is no stranger to natural disasters and humanitarian crises.

There is currently a growing body of academic work and psychology experiments that verify the empathy-inducing effects of this technology. Pakistani disaster relief operators should take note. Skills training: Be it professional sportsmen, medical staff, machine operators, or health and safety professionals, high-quality training is a vital ingredient for productivity and excellence. The Metaverse can facilitate such training effectively while offering substantial time and cost savings. For instance, imagine virtual training for handling rare but costly scenarios in factories or facing a thousand virtual bouncers from the world’s fastest bowler to perfect your hook shot. Through such immersive training, PSL franchises, manufacturing plants, hospitals, and retail corporations can all level up. The tech is available now. It’s not science fiction.\n\nThe above isn’t an exhaustive list of suggestions; it’s more intended to stimulate minds and get the ball rolling.\n\nForming a consensus\n\nThis article means nothing if it cannot spur action. Yet, pessimism has so overtaken the zeitgeist that the Metaverse sounds like a distant dream for affluent times.\n\nHowever, we must realise that the world always tends to gravitate toward chaos. It’s a law of nature. There will never be a “perfect time”. Instead, Pakistan will need to consciously, effortfully turn the tide, one step at a time. The tide won’t turn automagically.\n\n“We can’t even make bicycles”. That sounds like a Pakistani quote, but it was in fact muttered by a prominent Israeli parliamentarian in 1951, who used the faltering bicycle industry to criticise a proposal to establish a futuristic Israeli aerospace company. Although it was deemed unrealistic, the proposal somehow went through.\n\nAs a result, the Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) was born. Today, IAI is one of Israel’s biggest employers. It has helped the country evolve from a land that could not manufacture bicycles to being one of the largest exporters of technology in the world. Big things have small beginnings.\n\nPakistan itself is no stranger to humble origins. The evolution of its nuclear programme is a testament to Pakistanis innovating when pushed against the wall.\n\nInternally, Pakistan’s nuclear programme mostly had broad support, cutting through egos, party lines, and civil-military friction. Key stakeholders wanted to get it done by hook or crook, no matter what it took. Why? Because the existential threats they faced brought them clarity. This clarity enabled them to act in unison. And that, in turn, created results greater than the sum of the parts. It’s akin to the physics principle of resonance but played out in the arena of human decision-making.\n\nSo far, innovative technology (such as the Metaverse) is a politically neutral subject in Pakistan. Hence, it can potentially enjoy broad support across the spectrum, like the country’s nuclear programme.\n\nHowever, let’s also be pragmatic. Pakistan remains a patronage economy, where it’s about who you know, not what you know. Cronyism is the name of the game. And the problem with cronyism is that even well-intentioned cronies get caught up in turf wars. The result is politics, not progress.\n\nWhile it remains largely unblemished to date, the adoption of innovative technology in Pakistan can still be toxified by factors such as those mentioned above. If that happens, the country’s technology aspirations will suffer a paralysing deadlock for decades, with another generation or two wasted like cannon fodder. Once humans dive into the rabbit hole of factionalism, common sense evaporates and nightmares come true. Case in point: Covid-19 was politicised in the US, leading to Americans taking their vaccine denialism to the next level, despite suffering the world’s largest tally of Covid deaths. It would be comical if it weren’t so tragic.\n\nIn short, Pakistan must adopt guardrails that ensure innovative technologies like the Metaverse remain insulated from unnecessary politicking and cronyism. It must also wilfully drive an internal consensus on the matter to catch the global trend early. As I said, big things have small beginnings. Such a consensus will pay massive, massive dividends in the future. Time to act now.\n\nFurther reading\n\nYou can stop reading now. But for those curious about the technical specifications of the Metaverse, I’ll indulge some more.\n\nMatthew Ball, a prominent Metaverse thinker and venture capitalist, has formulated perhaps the best definition of the Metaverse. His definition is roughly: “the Metaverse is a collection of 3D virtual worlds that are interoperable and massively scaled, have high concurrency, are synchronous and persistent, and render in real-time”.\n\nLet me explain some of those concepts.\n\nInteroperable: Virtual worlds in the Metaverse will all speak to one another. Practically that means items, progression, and the rules from each world will be recognisable in all other worlds. Without such interoperability, the Metaverse will reduce to a collection of walled gardens without synergies. Although opinions vary, I believe blockchains will play a pivotal role in enabling interoperability.\n\nVirtual worlds in the Metaverse will all speak to one another.

Persistence: What people do in these worlds will leave a permanent mark. For example, if you disconnected while constructing a building, you won’t start from scratch upon returning. Or if you made a dent in some corner of the world, that dent would stay in perpetuity.\n\nWhat people do in these worlds will leave a permanent mark. For example, if you disconnected while constructing a building, you won’t start from scratch upon returning. Or if you made a dent in some corner of the world, that dent would stay in perpetuity. Real-time: These worlds and the people in them will react to inputs without perceptible lag.\n\nOur civilisation has advanced to the point where the above specifications don’t seem outlandish science fiction. Indeed we are already seeing glimpses of these capabilities in much of the current technology. That is why the leading technology thinkers of our age can now sense the Metaverse coming.\n\nGiven the exaggerated hype the term ‘Metaverse’ is seeing in the media, it’s easy to ignore it as another marketing ploy for milking attention. Perhaps the word ‘Metaverse’ will get rebranded in the coming years. But its underlying thesis won’t change. Look under the hood; there’s a ton of substance.\n\nBelieve the hype, prepare yourself, and bide your time. It’s now a question of ‘when’, not ‘if’. The world our children see will be very different from what we see and Pakistan would do well to be a major part of it.\n\nIllustrations by Rare Sense Inc.",
    "‘Heart-breaking’: Irish priest says Pakistan flooding still critical": "Parishioners affected by the flooding sleep in makeshift shelters in Badin, where the Columban missionaries are helping relief efforts. Columban Father Liam O’Callaghan told Catholic News Service there was “an urgent need for relief aid,” and he appealed to Catholics worldwide to respond. (Credit: CNS photo/Courtesy Father Liam O’Callaghan.)\n\nDUBLIN — An Irish missionary priest in Pakistan said the “sheer scale” of the flooding disaster is “hard to comprehend” and “the misery of people, camped on the side of the road with their meager belongings, is heart-breaking to see.”\n\nColumban Father Liam O’Callaghan told CNS there was “an urgent need for relief aid,” and he appealed to Catholics worldwide to respond.\n\n“The reality is shocking. The infrastructure — like roads, bridges, rail lines, schools, health centers — is so damaged. Where do you start? It will take years to repair,” he said via Zoom from the Columban-run parish of St. Thomas the Apostle in Badin, a rural city in the Diocese of Hyderabad in Sindh province.\n\nThe Pakistani government has declared a national emergency. More than 1,100 people died and many more were injured in the flooding caused by this year’s significantly heavier monsoon rains, which deluged the South Asian country over a two-month period. More than 220,000 houses were destroyed and another 500,000 were damaged.\n\nAid agencies are finding it difficult to get into the areas where relief is most needed due to the damage caused to hundreds of bridges and thousands of miles of road. The economic losses are estimated to be over $10 billion.\n\nO’Callaghan, who has been working in Pakistan since 1998, said that while the whole country has been suffering, Sindh and Balochistan provinces, in the south and southwest, have been the worst-affected by the floods.\n\nThe country experienced nearly 190 percent more rain than the 30-year average in this year’s monsoon season, with Sindh province getting 466 percent more rain than the average.\n\n“There has been six months of extreme weather and climate chaos, a cocktail starting with the heat wave in March and April. March was one of the hottest on record, with 60 percent less rainfall. That was followed by heavier monsoon rains, and the glacier melts in the north filled the rivers,” O’Callaghan explained.\n\n“In Sindh province, where the Columbans work, the situation is still critical. The majority of the province is under water at the moment. The sheer scale is hard to comprehend. In places it is like looking out on a lake as far as the eye can see,” he said in late September.\n\nThe area along the flood plain of the Indus River was badly affected. “About 2 million acres of cultivated crops have been wiped out, and many hundreds of thousands of livestock have been lost. This will lead to food shortages and food inflation over the coming months,” the priest said.\n\nHe added that he is worried about the impact of the coming winter and the challenge of waterborne diseases linked to the lack of sanitation and clean drinking water. Cholera, malaria and dengue fever are likely to thrive in stagnant flood waters.\n\nIn Badin and Khipro, where the Columbans work, many parishioners have been affected. The missionaries have been helping to distribute food rations, tents, mosquito nets, and medical aid to the most vulnerable families.\n\nChristians are a small minority in Sindh and Balochistan provinces. O’Callaghan said they tend to be poor tenant farmers.\n\n“Their lives were already fragile, and the flooding has made it even worse,” he said.\n\nThe relief effort could last for months, while house reconstruction will come later.\n\n“There are big questions such as where do you rebuild?” said O’Callaghan. “Those worst affected were already the poorest who were living in areas prone to flooding.”\n\nThe priest, a member of Hyderabad Diocesan Climate Change Group, warns that there is “an urgent need for wealthy countries to reduce greenhouse emissions.”\n\n“Pakistan has contributed very little to emissions, but it is in countries like Pakistan that the effects of the climate crisis are worst. The church needs to take more seriously the ecological teaching of Pope Francis and use its moral authority in the corridors of power.”",
    "None fooled by US call on Pakistan F-16s: EAM S Jaishankar": "Ahead of his meeting with secretary of state Antony Blinken, external affairs minister S Jaishankar has raised questions over the “merits” of the US-Pakistan relationship and asserted that Washington’s ties with Islamabad had not served the “American interest”.He was speaking at an event organised by the Indian American community in Washington on Sunday. The remarks were made when the minister was asked by the audience about the recent US decision to provide a $450 million sustenance package for Pakistan ’s fleet of F-16 fighter jets, overturning a Trump era decision.Referring to the US argument that the package was to fight terrorism, Jaishankar said everybody knew where and against whom F-16 were used. \"You're not fooling anybody by saying these things,\" he said.The US had claimed that the move was not designed as a message to India; rather, it was associated with America's defence partnership with Islamabad which was primarily focused on counterterrorism. Earlier defence minister Rajnath Singh had also lodged his protest with his US counterpart on Washington’s decision.America's relationship with Pakistan has \"not served\" either of the two countries, Jaishankar said. \"Very honestly, it's a relationship that has neither ended up serving Pakistan well, nor serving the American interests. So, it is really for the United States today to reflect on what are the merits of this relationship and what they get by it,\" he said.In yet another message to the US, Jaishankar said India’s dependence on Russian defence equipment and the strong defence ties with Moscow were not because New Delhi did not approach Washington in the past to get those.“From 1965, pretty much for the next 40 years, there was no US defence equipment for India. This was, in fact, a period when the India-Soviet, India-Russia relationship became very strong,” he said recalling: “This was not due to a lack of trying on India’s part. I can vouch for it myself.I’ve had my relatives, my father, my grandfather, they worked with the defence ministry. So, I know first-hand what great efforts were made over those years to try to make the US understand that it was in American interest to have a strong, united, independent, prosperous India.” “At that time, they did not succeed, maybe the state of the world was such,” he noted.“The change that started was really triggered by the nuclear deal that removed a very big obstacle to go forward and then to actually take the relationship to a new level requires leadership in India that did not have reservations.\" “It takes two hands to clap. It was not just that all the problems were on the American side, they were visitations on the Indian side as well,” he said.“So, we also have to address the institutions on our side. I think today, the relationship is on a very different footing. We have the possibility of working together in many more areas, especially the security domain.Some of our major exercises are with the American military. We fly a number of American planes today, the C 17,” the minister said. Blinken will host a dinner in Jaishankar’s honour and hold formal dialogue with him on Tuesday.",

    "Pakistan reels from floods: ‘We thought we’d die of hunger. Now we fear death from water’": "Farmer Ali Baksh stands on an embankment and points across the flooded landscape of Sindh province towards the spot where his fields used to be. He is sheltering in a makeshift camp accessible only by boat with more than 2,000 others forced to flee their homes when the floods hit.\n\n“There was no rain a few months back and there was a severe shortage of water for crops. We prayed for rain. But when it rained, we became homeless and our crops were destroyed. We have nothing left … just oceans on roads, on farms and submerging our homes.”\n\nPakistan has been battered by drastic weather extremes since the start of the year. Deadly heatwaves sent temperatures above 50C (122F) in the spring, followed by huge wildfires and crippling droughts.\n\nBut the floods that have left a third of the country’s provinces underwater in recent weeks have brought with them a new level of human misery – and a glimpse into the apocalyptic impact of the climate emergency in one of the countries least responsible for it.\n\nPylons felled by flood waters in Mingora, the capital of Swat valley. Photograph: Naveed Ali/AP\n\n“I have seen many humanitarian disasters in the world, but I have never seen climate carnage on this scale,” said the UN general secretary, António Guterres, on a visit to Pakistan this week. “I have simply no words to describe what I have seen today.”\n\nSuper flood\n\nThe record monsoon that began in mid-June has devastated much of the country, with some areas receiving more than eight times their usual rainfall.\n\nTorrents of water tore through villages, sweeping away thousands of houses, schools, roads and bridges and destroying 18,000 sq km of agricultural land.\n\nIn Sindh, the southernmost province of Pakistan, which produces half the country’s food, 90% of crops have been ruined, and an inland lake 60 miles (100km) wide stretches to the horizon after the Indus River burst its banks.\n\nPeople survey their damaged houses on the outskirts of Quetta in Balochistan province. Photograph: Jamal Taraqai/EPA\n\nThe flood is estimated to have killed at least 1,400 people. Many tens of millions more have lost their homes and livelihoods and the country has incurred huge financial costs. Damages so far have been put at $30bn (£26bn).\n\nIn the flood’s immediate aftermath, aid agencies report that innumerable children have been left hungry and dependent on contaminated drinking water for survival, while pregnant women and elderly people are crowded into makeshift relief camps and unable to access life-saving medicines. Hospitals in the worst-hit areas are overwhelmed. Medics in one district say malaria cases are rising so fast that they have run out of capacity to even test for the disease, let alone treat it.\n\nAs the horrors mount, a traumatised population now faces food shortages, famine and disease. Few doubt t at the crisis engulfing the country will get much worse in the coming weeks and months.\n\n“The scale of this and what is still to come for the people of Pakistan is quite chilling, to be honest,” said Farhana Yamin, a former UN lawyer who was born in Pakistan and helped to draft the 2015 Paris climate agreement. “This is not a small country, it is the fifth most populous country in the world, and it has been devastated … It will take decades to recover.”\n\n‘Ground zero’\n\nPakistan is responsible for less than 1% of global carbon emissions, according to European Union data, but as the last six months have shown, it is at the sharp end of the climate crisis.\n\nThe country, which was already in the throes of political and economic turmoil, has turned to the international community for help with a crisis it bears little responsibility for.\n\n“Global warming is the existential crisis facing the world and Pakistan is ground zero,” said Pakistan’s climate change minister, Sherry Rehman. “There is so much loss and damage, with so little reparations to countries that contributed so little to the world’s carbon footprint, that obviously the bargain made between the global north and global south is not working.”\n\nFlood survivors in search of higher ground. Photograph: Akhtar Soomro/Reuters\n\nThe story of Pakistan’s climate turmoil in 2022 makes for stark reading. Early heatwaves in April sent temperatures soaring to 50C in many parts of the country, pushing up against the limits of what the human body can endure.\n\nThe deadly heat sparked a huge wildfire the following month that engulfed Shirani, the world’s largest natural pine forest, spread over 26,000 hectares and home to more than 10.8m trees. The blaze in the south-western province of Balochistan reduced 40% of the forest to ashes.\n\nAlso in May, in the Mastung district of Balochistan, which is known for its apple and peach orchards, farmer Haji Ghulam Sarwar Shahwani watched in despair as his apple trees blossomed more than a month earlybefore shrivelling in the heat, killing most of the fruit.\n\nBut the floods that followed the heat a month later brought a level of devastation he had never witnessed before, he said.\n\nInternally displaced people wade through flood waters in the Jaffarabad district of Balochistan. Photograph: Fida Hussain/AFP/Getty\n\n“It rained for weeks in July and August and then flood water coming from the mountains damaged all of my 6,000 apple trees. We could only see the top of the trees in the flooded water and they can’t grow now. We have to cut them once the flood water is drained,” Shahwani said.\n\nSurveying his devastated orchards, which had taken him decades to build up, he said: “I have never seen such heatwaves in April in Mastung, nor such massive floods in my lifetime. It rained continuously for more than 120 hours in some areas. This much water, it seems, is unreal to me. It has washed away all we had.”\n\nAbdul Rasool, a farmer and political activist, said many farmers had been facing drought earlier in the year and feared that their crops, such as rice and wheat, would die, only for the floods to take their place with devastating effect.\n\nSign up to Down to Earth Free weekly newsletter The planet's most important stories.

Photograph: Fida Hussain/AFP/Getty\n\n“We thought we would die of hunger, but now the floods have swept away everything and there is water as [far] as we can see. We fear death from water … It has killed hundreds of people.”\n\nExperts say a series of deep monsoon depression systems swept across the country, with torrential rain falling day after day on steep slopes that were already saturated. This caused huge flash floods and gave people little time to escape.\n\nScientists have carried out an initial rapid attribution study of the disaster, a way of determining how much worse, or more likely, an extreme weather event was made by human-caused global heating. They concluded that climate change could have increased the power and severity of the flooding in the worst-affected areas by about 50%. Floods were previously a once-in-a-century event, but the study found they are likely to become more frequent in future as global temperatures continue to rise.\n\nClimate breakdown\n\nYamin, who no longer works for the UN but still has family in Pakistan, said the tragedy was that a climate disaster on this scale had been utterly predictable for anyone who had been paying attention.\n\n“We knew this sort of event was coming and have been warning about it for years,” she said. “That’s what’s so sad. Runaway climate change is happening in Pakistan, but still it feels like that is not enough for policymakers to start taking this seriously.”\n\nThe signs of climate breakdown are all too visible across large swaths of the country. In Balochistan, the largest and most impoverished province, which covers half of Pakistan, the mountains are usually barren and dry with little or no grass..\n\nBut since the floods, lush meadows have covered the slopes, while in the valleys below there is chaos, with many of the roads and bridges destroyed.\n\nPeople cross a temporary footbridge in the Swat valley, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Photograph: Abdul Majeed/AFP/Getty\n\nProf Gohram Khan, the head of environmental science at Balochistan University of Information Technology, Engineering and Management Sciences, said: “This much heavy downpours have changed everything … We were not expecting it. It was beyond the expectations of people … There is going to be destruction. Nature is going to change. It is changing so fast.”\n\nThe devastation wrought by the floods has triggered a debate about climate justice both within Pakistan and internationally.\n\nBakhshal Thalho, a political worker and general secretary of the Awami worker party in Sindh province, said that although the Pakistani authorities needed to do more, it was western countries and corporations in the global north that were driving the extreme weather through their carbon emissions.\n\n“The entire south Asia is being affected due to climate change and it is not of our own making. Rather, the industrialised and capitalised world has played the main role in this, but we are paying the price for it,” he said.\n\nResidents use a temporary cradle service to cross the swollen river Swat. Photograph: Abdul Majeed/AFP/Getty\n\nCampaigners and experts say the devastation that has hit Pakistan is a foretaste of what the world faces unless there is a rapid and concerted effort to reduce emissions and protect vulnerable countries.\n\n“The immense tragedy in Pakistan is also an immense injustice, but the really scary thing is that this tragedy and injustice will be exceeded, again and again, in the years to come,” said Prof Simon Lewis, a climate scientist at University College London.\n\n“The floods, heatwaves and droughts will increase until the world reduces carbon emissions down to zero. Fossil fuels were once enablers of human progress, now they destroy it. The quicker we end their use, the safer we will all be.”\n\nAsad Rehman, a leading climate justice campaigner and director of War on Want, said governments in rich nations were trying to “solve their energy crisis, pushing ahead with huge carbon bombs, on the backs of poorer black and brown people” despite the huge human and environmental suffering they were causing.\n\nA woman carries her baby in Sehwan. Photograph: Akhtar Soomro/Reuters\n\n“What we are seeing clearly in Pakistan is a toxic mix of extreme weather, inequality, and an unjust economic system that combines with colonial mindsets that devalue the lives of the world’s poorest people,” he said.\n\nBack on the Superio embankment in Sindh, farmer Baksh, who lost all his fields, can only face the devastating reality left behind by the floods.\n\n“People call it a climate catastrophe in Pakistan,” he said, surveying the water that stretches for miles in all directions. “I don’t know how much time it will take flood water to drain. I really don’t know when the government will rescue us from this embankment. Everything is so uncertain.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Waseem Mohamed",
    "Pakistan wrestle over weightlifting administration. Two sporting bodies fighting for control amidst allegations of corruption": "Despite two different sporting bodies vying to run weightlifting in Pakistan, the International Weightlifting Federation has decided to let the dispute continue for now and has backed the existing body, which is being challenged by a government-backed organisation. While one body, the current sports authority of the sport in Pakistan, holds a letter from the IWF backing them, the other body has been approved by the Pakistan Sports Board (PSB).\n\nThe argument being made by the government-backed sports board is that rampant corruption has taken place in the current weightlifting organisation and this move will allow for a fresh start.\n\nHafiz Zafar Iqbal, a former national champion who was appointed to the interim committee, said to Insidethegames.biz, “The intention of the PWLF is to protect the corrupt, while the PSB has acted to maintain discipline, as a controlling body of sports in Pakistan.”\n\nMeanwhile the Pakistan Weightlifting Federation (PWLF) has said that the sole intention of PSB has been to take over the Pakistan Olympic Association and this is a move towards making that a reality. PWLF chief Hafiz Imran Butt said that there is no law or validity of the PSB taking over weightlifting in the country, in this manner.\n\n“The PWLF is not a banned federation and is working under its own constitution and under the constitutions of the POA and the IWF – and none of them has banned the PWLF. The PSB was created to provide infrastructure to National Federations, which it is not doing. The dispute has been created by the PSB just to put, by force, a few retired army friends at the helm of affairs of a properly constituted weightlifting federation,” said Butt.\n\nThe Pakistan Sports Board on the other hand, said that the PWLF were directly responsible for the doping violations that have occurred in the past months. Pakistani weightlifter Talha Talib tested positive twice in November and December along with six other team members who had been provisionally suspended for doping violations. Four of those violations were based on samples not being provided.\n\nIqbal said that three of these six violations were made by the three sons of Amjad Amin Butt, the vice president and former secretary of PWLF. He then added that in the two other violations, the coach of both players was Irfan Butt, the son of PWLF president Hafiz Imran Butt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I fail to understand how the POA and PWLF managed to deceive the IWF and fetch a letter in favour of the suspended President. I would request the IWF to review its decision and withdraw support of Hafiz Imran Butt until finality of the inquiry,” said Iqbal.\n\nIrrespective of where Pakistan weightlifting goes, their current bleak circumstances are compounded by the fact that they most likely face a ban from the sport for multiple doping violations and are most likely not going to be able to participate at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games.",
    "UW mourning former student killed in Pakistan": "The University of Waterloo is mourning after former student Sara Inam was killed in Pakistan as a result of intimate partner violence, the university said in a media release.\n\nOn Monday, UW president and vice-chancellor Vivek Goel described Inam as a “talented economist and kind friend by all accounts.”\n\n“The continued prevalence of gender-based violence here in Canada and around the world weighs heavily on us all. Ms. Inam’s death comes on the heels of the death of Mahsa Amini at the hands of Tehran’s Guidance Patrol – an act that has sparked massive protests in Iran and also here on our own campus,” he said in the release.\n\nI was deeply saddened to wake up to news of the death in Pakistan of a former #UWaterloo student, Sara Inam. Sara was killed as a result of intimate partner violence. The continued prevalence of gender-based violence here in Canada and around the world weighs heavily on us all. — Vivek Goel (@UWaterlooPres) September 26, 2022\n\nThe university will hold a silent vigil Tuesday afternoon at 5:30 p.m., in front of Dana Porter Library to raise awareness about Amini’s case and to continue to stand against gender-based violence in Iran and here at home, Goel said.\n\n“It is crucial that together we use our collective voices to speak out against this abuse. We as an institution will be participating in the UN Women’s 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence campaign,” said Goel.\n\nInam’s death comes days after the UW announced a 20-year-old student was killed while in Alberta earlier this year in a hit and run.\n\nIn a media release Thursday, the university said Ariana Kolenda, a second-year physics student in the faculty of science died on May 1 after a hit and run on the Trans-Canada Highway.",
    "Snipers take positions in Pakistan to try to make cricket feel normal": "Seen from the roof of Karachi’s National Stadium, the city stretches as far as you can see in all directions, up into the hills one way and out into the sea the other. Around 18 million people live here. Only the soldiers stand out. They are conspicuous in their black uniforms, as dark and numerous as the kites overhead, and as watchful, too.\n\nThe Pakistan Cricket Board has spent so much on the security for this tour it will not make money from it even with all the corporate sponsorship. It is a loss-leader for the country, meant to reassure the English that this is a safe place to visit, and the world that Pakistan is a safe place to do business.\n\nBefore Tuesday’s T20 international you could pick out the three-man sniper teams stationed around the stadium, one on the roof of the Indus University, another on top of the huge billboard advertising Strawberryade, a third above an apartment block silhouetted by the setting sun. The Spidercam, which is supposed to provide aerial pictures for the TV feed, had been taken down overnight. The story went around that it was removed when the security team realised it would make it impossible for the army helicopter that follows the team to land on the outfield if needed for an emergency evacuation.\n\nOn the outfield, the England team were having their customary warm-up kickabout. It was as far as the players had been from their security detail all week. “Every time I go to the toilet, there’s somebody following me,” said Harry Brook. “I’ve never really had that before.”\n\nThe players were disconcerted by it at first and discussed the security situation in a team meeting. It was explained that the guards needed to stay within a few paces so they could intervene if anyone came up with a knife or gun. Which, like all of this, has the effect of making you at once feel more protected but somehow less safe. It magnifies your sense of threat, as if the lobby of their five-star hotel, which is filled with well-heeled businessmen drinking tea and well-to-do families attending weddings, was actually a den of potential assassins. Extraordinary lengths have been undertaken to make Karachi feel like an ordinary place to play cricket.\n\nPakistan fans welcome England with a homemade sign during the first T20 match. Photograph: Alex Davidson/Getty Images\n\nThere’s another side to the city, waiting right outside the metal gates. Moeen Ali knows. When he came here to play in the Pakistan Super League in 2020, he brought his family and they moved around freely, went to cafes, restaurants and shopping malls.\n\nThe rest of us have been able to do exactly that this week, too. Out there, Karachi is full of good things to eat and see and do. Everywhere you go people want to know how you are finding the city.\n\nThey ask whether you’re enjoying yourself and are anxious to know whether they can do any more for you. It’s a sign of the stigma they felt during those years in exile from international cricket and how wounding it must have been.\n\nOne day, international teams will be able to experience the country the way Moeen did. But for now, the PCB has no choice but to shutter them off from it. It has been seven years since Zimbabwe came to play two T20s – the first visit from a Test-playing nation since 2009 – but the last few months have been their most high-profile stretch of fixtures yet.\n\nIn March, Australia came for the first time in 24 years, England this month for the first time in 17, next January, New Zealand will come back to resume the series they abandoned in 2021 after their government received what was described as a credible threat to the team’s security.\n\nIn 2002, the New Zealand team were staying right here in this same corner of Karachi when a bomb went off outside their hotel. Their physio was injured by flying glass and the match was abandoned. Their captain, Stephen Fleming, spoke about how shocked he had been by the way the city (which had already endured a decade of sectarian violence) carried on with its business in the aftermath.\n\nSign up to The Spin Free weekly newsletter Subscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s action Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

London is a victim too these days and it’s easy to forget that the 2005 Ashes and the 2017 Champions Trophy were played in England in the immediate aftermath of terrorist attacks in the city.\n\nThe PCB has to go above and beyond what seems normal because it cannot risk anything going wrong. And the reminders of what can go wrong are all around if you want to look for them. Ahsan Raza is standing as one of the umpires in this series. He still has the bullet scars in his chest from where he was hit during the 2009 terrorist attack on the Test in Lahore and will show them to you.\n\nA raucous atmosphere welcomed the teams in the first T20, which went to the final over. Photograph: Alex Davidson/Getty Images\n\nThe country’s governing body has grand plans for the next few years. It is launching a Women’s Super League and is recruiting some high-profile investors, as well as a Pakistan Junior League, in which 66 under-19 players from around the world will take part in a T20 tournament in Lahore.\n\nSome 175 foreign players have registered to be part of the draft for that, including 10 from England, such as the two leg-spinners Archie Lenham and Rehan Ahmed. The hope here is that it will be the first of many trips to Pakistan made by that generation of players and that over the years the PCB will be able to peel back those layers of security so that by the end of their fledgling careers, their country will be a destination like any other.",
    "Could Balochistan secede from Pakistan?": "The rain and the cold in Quetta, the capital of the Pakistani province of Balochistan, did not deter them. Neither did the floods that ravaged their homes. The families of Balochistan’s missing had been protesting for days outside the provincial government’s headquarters. On August 25, one of the protestors, Seema Baloch, the sister of Shabbir Baloch, a student leader who had been missing for weeks, fell unconscious and had to be taken to a nearby hospital. The others simply kept protesting.\n\nGovernment officials gently asked them to leave, but when the protesters asked about the missing—all allegedly abducted by Pakistani security forces—the officials professed ignorance or, worse, helplessness.\n\nBaloch activists claim that nearly a thousand people disappear every year, abducted by the Pakistani security forces. The security forces link nearly all of the missing to Balochistan’s independence movement. The call for independence is rapidly gathering momentum there.\n\nIt’s not a new call. On August 12, 1947, the eve of Pakistan’s birth, the Khan of Kalat and ruler of most of Balochistan, Mir Ahmad Yar Khan, announced that Balochistan would be independent, part of neither Pakistan nor India.\n\nBut Pakistan’s founding prime minister, Mohammed Ali Jinnah, had other plans.\n\nJinnah threatened the Khan of Kalat and other Baloch tribal leaders with the newly formed Pakistani army. Yar Khan reluctantly agreed to Balochistan’s accession to Pakistan in April 1948. But 18 days later, Jinnah’s government asked the Pakistani army to invade Balochistan anyway. The army arrested Yar Khan and, in the months that followed, jailed Baloch leaders and imposed martial law.\n\nThe Baloch people have never forgotten. Today, they are once again demanding independence from Pakistan. Some have become violent. They accuse the Pakistani army, a looming presence in the region since 1948, of violence against them. Bombings and kidnappings are now a daily occurrence. Balochistan has become dangerously unstable, and the West does not care.\n\nBalochistan occupies nearly 44 per cent of Pakistan’s land mass and borders Iran’s Sistan Province, home to many who also call themselves Baloch. The province has some of the world’s largest copper and gold deposits, and rich stores of coal, oil, and natural gas. Last year, the state-owned Pakistan Petroleum Corporation announced the discovery of huge gas reserves there: one trillion cubic feet.\n\nLeaders of the three major political groups that seek independence—the Free Baloch Movement, the Baloch Republican Party, and the Baloch National Movement—are in exile. Another group that seeks independence, the Baloch Liberation Army, operates from within the province. It is not above using bombs and violence to achieve its ends.\n\nThe leader of the Baloch National League, based in Europe, which seeks to unite Balochistan’s independence movements under a single banner, told me, ‘We are being hunted by the Pakistani establishment. We fear for our lives, even in exile.’ My sources would speak only on condition of anonymity, fearing for their lives.\n\nThe uproar threatens the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor; the port of Gwadar; gold, copper, and uranium mines; and even Pakistan’s nuclear complex in the Chagai Mountains of Balochistan.\n\nNearly a third of the China-Pakistan Economic corridor passes through Balochistan. Through the port of Gwadar, the corridor connects Kashgar in China’s Xinjiang province to the Arabian Sea, providing Beijing with a link to the Strait of Hormuz, the Persian Gulf, the Arabian Sea, and the Indian Ocean.\n\nChina has committed to investing more than $60 billion in this route. It is strategically imperative for Beijing not only because it’s part of the Belt and Road Initiative, but because it gives China a land route to the Strait of Malacca, the world’s most critical maritime chokepoint.\n\nSources in Balochistan told me that a joint venture company, Jiwan China, is secretly building a naval base in Jiwani, a small town with a port very near Gwadar. They also said China and Pakistan were privately forging a plan for China to station more forces in Balochistan to secure its investments.\n\nApart from the recent devastation caused by floods, political unrest in Balochistan has grown rapidly. Sources tell me the freedom movement now has deep roots. According to one, the Baloch independence movement may be led by political and guerrilla groups, but it has the full support of the Baloch nation: ‘Islamabad is an occupier and coloniser who has colonised and occupied Balochistan. A coloniser and occupier will never develop a region but will loot and subjugate it,’ says one Baloch National Movement leader.\n\nIslamabad disagrees, claiming that the separatists are a fringe group. Nevertheless, my sources say that Islamabad has deployed the Pakistan Army, along with the Frontier Corps, throughout Balochistan, with some four to six small army camps in each district and one or two major camps in each; all total, there are nearly a quarter of a million army personnel there. They say the army’s operations are devastating: The military raids homes, they say, and disappears people in large numbers; it dumps the dead bodies in the streets and the hills, and conducts air strikes that kill, injure, and damage property.\n\nThe Balochistan Human Rights Commission, in a report released in May this year, claimed there were 442 disappearances in the province in 2021, involving fake encounters, abductions, extrajudicial killings, targeted killings, and torture by Pakistani forces. The primary targets were Baloch students and activists demanding greater autonomy or independence for Balochistan.\n\nIn August, Pakistani security forces reportedly raided a college dormitory in the city of Quetta in Balochistan, beat up four students, then arrested them without charge. In the city of Turbat, security forces arrested freshman student Yousuf Nisar as he returned home from a soccer match. The families of the detainees say they were given no reason for their arrest.\n\nLeading Baloch separatist figures say the students were arrested because of their sympathy with the independence cause. A leader of the Baloch Liberation Front, a group that has long fought the Pakistani army and sought independence, told me that the police and the army suspected them of being activists. In some cases, the boys had actively espoused the cause, but ‘in most cases the mere hint that they support Baloch nationalism is enough,’ he said. Often, the visibly tortured bodies of the abductees are thrown into the mountains. The Baloch Voice Association, a Paris-based nongovernmental organisation, is planning a three-day banner and poster exhibition on these disappearances at the 51st session of the Human Rights Commission in Geneva.\n\nThe Canadian mining company Barrick Gold has been openly warned to stay out of the province by the Baloch Raji Aajoi Sangar, a conglomerate of armed separatists, I was told by a Baloch source. Two weeks ago, the company signed an agreement with the provincial government. The conglomerate has not yet responded publicly, but my sources indicate that if work on the project begins, retaliation will occur.\n\nThe provincial government, led by chief minister Mir Abdul Quddus Bizenjo, has signed an agreement with Barrick Gold that calls for a $10 billion investment and promises to create 8,000 jobs in the province. Bizenjo has seemingly delivered: job creation for locals, investment in the province, and more. But for the Baloch, that’s no longer enough, said an exiled Baloch National League leader: ‘We want the jobs. We want the investments. But we don’t want the fruits of our labour to go to Pakistan and Islamabad.’\n\nBaloch separatists often cite Baloch natural gas reserves, among the largest in Asia, as an example of their grievances. They say the gas has been pumped out of Balochistan, benefiting Pakistan’s Punjab region, while industry in Balochistan has barely grown.\n\nThe Gwadar port is already besieged. Work on the port has been significantly delayed because Baloch activist groups have been targeting Chinese workers on the site and throughout the region. Chinese trawlers, fishing off the coast of Gwadar, have been attacked. Gwadar fishermen say that Chinese large-scale mechanised fishing is destroying the local fishing industry. ‘The people of Gwader are no longer allowed to fish in the sea as they used to. Those who are allowed can only fish in a limited area. The rest of the sea is controlled by Chinese engineers, the navy and fishing companies, and the Pakistani army,’ said a source in Gwadar.\n\nThe Baloch people oppose the China Pakistan Economic Corridor, a Baloch separatist leader told me. ‘We have not agreed to the project. It is a project that exploits the Balochs’ mineral resources, especially gold and copper.’ He told me that Baloch militants had repeatedly attacked the project’s infrastructure and the officials associated with it.\n\nChinese personnel and the corridor’s rail and road infrastructure have been attacked, frequently, with crudely made bombs. The violence is now so acute that in June, Beijing wanted to move in with its forces. The Pakistani government hasn’t yet made a decision. But my sources indicate that China has now quietly stationed between 1,500 and 3,000 naval personnel in Gwadar and Jiwani.\n\nOther parts of Balochistan are similarly destabilised. Quetta, the capital, was once home to the notorious Quetta Shura, the Taliban’s inner leadership, which crossed over to Afghanistan last August. Nearly a million Pashtun refugees from Afghanistan live there now, and it remains a haven for outlawed groups that seek to impose the Sharia upon Pakistan, such as the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan and the Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan—both of which regularly harass the Pakistani army and Islamabad.\n\nBaloch leaders say that while groups like these are officially banned, they enjoy the patronage of Pakistan Inter-Services Intelligence, the country’s most powerful entity. A Baloch separatist leader told me that the army and ISI had given the TTP and its like sanctuary in Quetta: ‘They have no presence in the rest of Balochistan. The Baloch and Pashtuns reject these organisations. They are the mercenaries of Pakistan army,’ he said.\n\nWhatever their provenance, Quetta has emerged as a hotbed of terrorism, with the TTP blamed for terrorist attacks throughout the country.\n\nChina and Islamabad have played a few cards shrewdly. Around Gwadar, China has begun offering Chinese language courses to locals. Beijing is actively courting political parties that have sought to join Pakistan’s broader political establishment, such as the Baloch Nationalist Party (Mengal) and the Balochistan Awami party.\n\nThe BNP (Mengal), led by Sardar Akhtar Jan Mengal, a former chief minister of Balochistan and current member of Pakistan’s parliament, rejects calls for complete independence. He wants more rights and autonomy for the province. The BAP is a newcomer to the game, formed in 2018 by dissidents from factions of the mainstream Pakistan Muslim League.\n\nBaloch separatists reject these parties, whom they believe to be in bed with the Pakistani federation and the army. China has been courting these parties assiduously for several years. ‘These parties have been mandated by China to win the heart of the people of Balochistan and increase the moral support of the people of Balochistan for China,’ one separatist told me. ‘Moreover, China has hired locals in Balochistan to create moral support for China and its investment in Balochistan,’ he claimed.\n\nBut the problems in Balochistan won’t be eradicated by teaching locals Chinese, nor by wooing local politicians. Nor were supporters of independence silenced by Islamabad. Instability in Balochistan could spill into Iran. This would destabilise the region.\n\nBut above all, it’s dragging Pakistan into the abyss.\n\nThis article first appeared on the Cosmopolitan Globalist substack.",
    "Pashtuns hold anti-Pakistan protest outside UN in Geneva": "Geneva [Switzerland], September 26 (ANI): A large number of Pashtuns participated in a protest outside the United Nations to raise the human rights violations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.\n\nThe demonstration was organised by the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM) during the ongoing 51st session of the UN Human Rights Council. The participants, including the Afghan Pashtuns, raised slogans decrying Pakistan for supporting terror groups and carrying out atrocities on the Pashtuns.\n\n“The issues of Baloch, Pashtuns and Sindhis which are arising due to Punjabi domination in Pakistan will be raised at the United Nations.

The Pakistan army is helping the Taliban to regain in the region,” Malik Barzai, the representative of PTM in Belgium said.\n\nFazal-ur Rehman Afridi, a Pashtun human rights activist said: “Its important to raise awareness among the people, not only in Pakistan but around the world that the Pashtuns are the victims of state-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan is using terrorists for such activities”.\n\nThe Pashtuns also organised a conference inside the UN where experts and intellectuals make deliberations on the situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The people in Pakistan’s Pashtun-dominated areas are facing persecution since Pakistan Army launched so-called war against terrorism.\n\nThey targeted the innocent Pashtuns, including women and children. A large number of youth disappeared, and the Pakistan Army brutally killed many. The residents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are demanding peace and have rejected terrorism and Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), who enjoys Islamabad’s support.

    "‘There is nothing for us’: Pakistan’s flood homeless start to despair": "After several attempts, Zameer Ali, his son and his brother were finally heaved on to the deck of a wooden boat.\n\nEarly that morning, the exhausted 48-year-old had waded out of his home with his relatives near the city of Khairpur Nathan Shah in Pakistan’s Sindh province to look for their livestock. As the water around them got deeper, they were forced to swim for six hours, using a bamboo stick for support, and had tired quickly.\n\n“We held on to the electricity tower and waited for someone to help,” Ali said from onboard the boat. “We screamed our hearts out for help … When no one stopped to help, I felt we would die.”\n\n02:16 Pakistan: hospitals struggle with influx of patients as third of country under water – video report\n\nThis area of Sindh’s Dadu district is indistinguishable from a lake, with water stretching as far as the eye can see. His house, like hundreds of thousands of houses in the area, has been submerged.\n\nBetween 5% and 10% of the city’s population of 350,000 are still stuck in their flooded homes. Those who can, travel around by boat. Others swim in the flood waters with a stick to get about. Sewage and flood waters have mixed to a dirty green. Interviews with local people painted a picture of a disaster on a scale that the government and NGOs were unable to cope with.\n\nTorrential monsoon rains that began in mid-June have devastated much of the country, washing away bridges, roads, livestock and people. One-third of Pakistan is underwater, more than 1,250 people have been killed, and more than 35 million people are affected in some way.\n\nDadu and neighbouring Qambar Shahdadkot are the worst-affected districts in the Sindh province, itself the worst-hit province. Flood water inundates roads for miles, making many towns inaccessible. Displaced people live in tents and makeshift homes on roadsides.\n\nThere is a common lament in Dadu that the breaching of Lake Manchar, the country’s largest freshwater lake, on Sunday to lower water levels in the district should have happened days ago, and for waters to be diverted from Dadu to the lake and from there to the sea.\n\nAs the boat that rescued Ali approached the main bazaar in Khairpur Nathan Shah, Khalid Hussain – a young man with a bamboo stick in hand and his belongings on his head – approached and started talking. He said there were no evacuation facilities for poor people, and no aid.\n\nKhalid Hussain, from Khairpur Nathan Shah, says he couldn’t get any help for his father. Photograph: Shah Meer Baloch\n\n“Yesterday, along with my ailing father, we stood in this corner of the city for three hours but the rescue team did not help my father or provide him with anything,” he said. “We had to rent a boat and send my father to a nearby hospital for treatment. The entire city is drowned with people inside their houses. No one from the government has come to help us.”\n\nAnother local man, Khadim Hussain, said authorities “consider us as insects”. “We are stranded. We lost all our belongings. We need food, medicine and help,” he said.\n\nFaisal Edhi, the head of the Edhi foundation charity, said that despite a great deal of effort made by the foundation, the government and other NGOs, they had collectively managed to reach just 10% or less of affected people. “People who survived the floods may die of starvation,” he warned.\n\nMany towns have been inaccessible and the Indus highway is flooded.\n\nSaifullah Chandio, a medical student, said she had tried to set up a first aid camp to help people suffering from waterborne diseases, but was unable to access financial support and medicines. “We will see another crisis soon as people are falling sick,” Chandio said.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

My daughter, who is just two years old, has a recurrent high fever and there are no medical facilities here.”\n\nHolding her son close to her, Ghulam e Kubra said: “There is nothing for us.

But when it rained, we became homeless and our crops were destroyed. We have nothing left.”",

    "Pakistan’s Scramble for a Peaceful and Stable Afghanistan": "The country’s initial euphoria at the Taliban victory has given way to concern as several troubling developments threaten its regional interests.\n\nPakistan and Taliban flags flutter on their respective sides while people walk through a security barrier to cross border at a key border crossing point between Pakistan and Afghanistan, in Chaman, Pakistan, Aug. 18, 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough stability is gaining ground in Afghanistan, challenges remain as the economy and people’s livelihoods are facing serious difficulties. These developments hold ramifications for the world, yet regional countries will be most heavily impacted by any development in Afghanistan – and none more than Pakistan, because of its geographical proximity and historical and cultural links.\n\nCircumstances have changed since the initial euphoria that Pakistan enjoyed after the Taliban won power in August 2021, because of Islamabad’s expectation that the regime change spelled an uncertain future for India in Afghanistan. Several challenges still exist in Afghanistan-Pakistan relations.\n\nThe first major concern is Pakistan’s security fence along the border, which has caused quarrels. Historically, Afghanistan has called the Durand Line an artificial border imposed by the British. Such views are present irrespective of the faction that is in power in Afghanistan. Against such loud reiterations, Pakistan has vowed to resolve the issue diplomatically. Still, the Taliban’s interim government has remained reluctant to accept the Durand Line as the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. The dispute persists even though the Taliban’s major interests are inevitably linked to Pakistan, be it efforts for recognition of the government, trade, or humanitarian assistance.\n\nThere have been recurring reports of Afghan security forces damaging Pakistan’s border fencing, calling it illegal. For instance, most recently, Enayatullah Khwarazmi, the spokesman of Afghanistan’s Ministry of Defense, said Pakistan has “no right” to separate Pashtuns living on either side of the Durand Line.\n\nDiplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. Get the Newsletter\n\nThe development has raised alarm bells for Pakistan. The ISPR’s director general, Maj. Gen. Babar Iftikhar, expressed a commitment that the fencing would be completed as planned, because “blood of martyred soldiers has been spilled while erecting the fence.”\n\nEnjoying this article?

Just $5 a month.\n\nThe border issue has remained a point of contention for decades, but there are even more pressing challenges.\n\nThe second major concern is that ever since the Taliban’s takeover, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has resurfaced with renewed political strength coupled with improved internal cohesion, thus raising eyebrows in Islamabad as the insurgents bring splintered factions back into the fold. Coupled with this development is the possibility of TTP cooperation with the Afghan Taliban. With the Taliban emboldened by the fall of Kabul, it is not an exaggeration to say that the TTP’s strong yet low-profile presence in Pakistan could act as a Trojan horse for Afghanistan in Pakistan. After all, TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud has pledged allegiance to Maulvi Hibatullah Akhundzada, the Afghan Taliban leader. So, the Taliban know that they can use the leverage of the TTP, a self-declared branch of the Taliban in Pakistan, to receive benefits from Pakistan. The TTP remains one of the most dangerous interregional terrorist threats to Pakistan.\n\nAdditionally, the Taliban government has released scores of TTP commanders in recent times, including former deputy chief Maulvi Faqir Muhammed. Such a gamble from the Taliban government would fray Pakistan’s support for a stable Afghanistan, especially if the security circles see a constructive resurfacing of militancy in Swat that undermines the decade-long counterinsurgency efforts by the Pakistan Army to oust the TTP. This could be one of the reasons why Pakistan reportedly (though it was never confirmed) carried out airstrikes in eastern Afghanistan, thereby sending a message to the Afghan government not to shelter militants on their soil.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPakistan has tried to open negotiations with TTP, yet Islamabad has failed to subdue the terrorist group’s rise in northwestern Pakistan. One reason for the failure is because Pakistan has tried to use the same strategy – for instance, the release of 90 TTP militants in 2021 – so that the negotiations continue, yet after a temporary ceasefire, the TTP resumes attacks. Such tactics are employed to gain momentum and remain an important tactic for “regrouping” and for securing the release of imprisoned senior leaders, thus improving the TTP’s position.\n\nThe third major concern is linked to Pakistan’s ambitions to link South Asia with Central Asia to promote regional connectivity, development, and the flow of energy from Central Asia toward Pakistan. Such ambitions can only be materialized if Afghanistan remains stable, as several projects between the two regions pass through Afghanistan’s north. Therefore, the future of several of Pakistan’s Vision Central Asia-inspired projects with the Central Asian States, including the TAPI and CASA 1000, depends on peace and stability in Afghanistan – a conflict-prone country.\n\nAfghanistan’s north is still subject to challenges from the Islamic State of Khorasan as well as Tajik and Uzbek militants. Several factions in Afghanistan are not willing to accept the Taliban’s rule. There are reports of challenges to the interim government, for instance, from the Islamic State, Uzbek resistance in Faryab province, Hazaras in Balkhab district led by Mawlawi Mehdi Mujahid, Tajiks in Parwan province led by Afghan Army chief Mohammad Yasin Zia, and Ahmad Masood’s forces, who are challenging the Taliban-led status quo in Afghanistan.\n\nThe fourth concern for Pakistan is the recognition of the Taliban’s interim government in Afghanistan, which for the global audience remains a pariah regime. Seemingly, the world is reluctant to pursue constructive engagement with the Taliban, based on global powers’ common calls for inclusivity in governance, women’s rights, and counterterrorism. Islamabad, however, remains committed to showing the world that the way forward is to move beyond such rhetorical arguments. If the great powers want to pressure Afghanistan, then they should constructively engage by incentivizing the Afghan government and then asking for compliance with international standards of governance.\n\nThat said, unless the world softens its stance on the interim government, Pakistan will remain hesitant to recognize the Taliban. Doing so unilaterally that could harm Pakistan’s already strained relations with the West and could lead to the threat of sanctions. For now, policy pundits in Pakistan are clear that the new Afghan government is a reality that must be recognized by the world. Pakistan’s foreign policy line remains close to what Uzbekistan’s President Shavkat Mirziyoyev said regarding recognition of the Taliban government: “We see no other option. We share a border, deep history and culture.”\n\nOnly time will tell how many other regional stakeholders will resonate with Mirziyoyev’s views. Until then, Pakistan, together with Afghanistan’s neighboring partners, is urging international actors to engage with the Taliban, because it does not want Afghanistan to become a cordon sanitaire for Pakistan’s relations with the West.\n\nPakistan’s position seems clear: Any true help for the Afghan people can hardly materialize if one bypasses the interim government of Afghanistan. But even as Pakistan scrambles to boost the prospects of a peaceful and stable Afghanistan by convincing the world to interact with the Afghan government, Islamabad finds itself facing several challenges from ongoing developments in Afghanistan. These challenges have led to mutual disdain, but cooperation between the two nations must take precedence.",
    "Pakistan in limbo amid power struggle of former PM and deep state": "On Dec. 18, 2010, during a live interview at the Islamabad Press Club, the late Director-General of Pakistan's intelligence services Hamid Gul casually affirmed that “no one becomes the Chief of Army Staff in Pakistan without the U.S.' approval.”\n\nEver since, every now and then, those words come back to haunt the political and military dispensation in Pakistan. Granted, this accusation is not new. It was always understood by uninhibited political analysts that Pakistan's formidable military rules the roost and to varying levels is in a tug-of-war with the United States hegemony. Of course, the level of influence, or give and take, vis-à-vis the U.S. has always been open for debate. It depends on who is leading the military establishment and how willing the powers are to antagonize their own people to oblige their purported benefactors in pursuit of their interests.\n\nAfter the removal of former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan from power by a dubious vote of no-confidence, this old debate has resurfaced. As such, many are asking “who controls Pakistan?” After all, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Donald Lu allegedly demanded the removal of Khan.\n\nSince then, the country has been in a dizzying decline – skyrocketing energy prices, economic collapse, an unprecedented level of popular revolt and the worst flooding the country has seen in the last 50 years.\n\nMeanwhile, the circus plays to its own choir while the country plunges into crisis.\n\nPakistan's current government has charged Khan as a terrorist. What makes this particularly outrageous is that the allegation of terrorism against Pakistan's most popular political leader is led by an illegitimate government, many of whom face serious allegations of financial impropriety and are out on bail. But Khan is not backing down.\n\nEndless tussle of the core, periphery\n\nAmerican sociologist Immanuel Wallerstein, in his World-System Theory, describes global order as the unequal distribution of power between the core – mainly the \"West,\" the semi-periphery countries and the periphery countries of the global south.\n\nThe reach of the “core” is able to influence the internal political structures of the periphery through locally kept leaders – be they in the political, economic, military, or judicial spheres. This leads to the untiring tussle in every post-colonial society between those who wish to facilitate the emergence of representative governance and those against it. On the one side, there are those who are the facilitators of the empire or the proprietors of the core. They excuse their betrayal with such gobbledygook as “enlightened moderation.” Then, they enrich themselves while lamenting punitive austerity measures on their populace since “beggars cannot be choosers.”\n\nOn the other side, there are those who aim to seize the instruments of state power away from those beholden to market fundamentalism or global hegemony. They seek genuine freedom. This unforgiving rivalry is real and goes to the crux of the conflict over state power. It is brutal and further compounded by people of varying interests/motivations vying for their own space. Many do not want to get involved or have lost hope for change. That is, until now.\n\nAfter being unceremoniously and arguably unlawfully removed from office, Khan has politicized his entire country. Yet, his will, commitment and perseverance have energized people like never before; he has made clear who stands on what side of the political spectrum and his pushback has overwhelmed the deep state.\n\nThis privileged class loathes their compatriots and rules only to institutionalize cronyism, inequality and corruption. This rationalization is required in order to purposively obstruct social development, stifle creativity and mock the ethical values and moral moorings of their own people.\n\nA further psychological aspect of these unrepresentative elites and their political cronies is that they embody some of the worst Islamophobic tendencies. It is more insidious since it occurs inside Muslim majority polities and is done by those who ostensibly claim to be Muslims. Despite that, Khan is deftly maneuvering and has swept by-elections in Pakistan's Punjab province by taking 15 out of 20 constituencies and won another by-election in Karachi. This is a remarkable feat and underlines that one can own all the institutions they want, but it is people that matter. If anything, Imran Khan's victory against the deep state, foreign interference and corrupt political parties is stunning.\n\nKashmir issue\n\nConcerning Kashmir, there will be no meaningful commitment until a semblance of political stability returns to Pakistan and legitimate representatives wrest power away from those with questionable integrity. Even worse, there are open discussions from the government of Pakistan opening trade links and working on the infamous \"Musharraf\" (country's former military ruler Gen. Pervez Musharraf) formula which is essentially maintaining the status quo and accepting the current cease-fire line as a porous border.\n\nAn Indian paramilitary soldier stands guard as a Kashmiri girl watches from a doorway during a strike in Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir, April 23, 2010. (AP Photo)\n\nIt must be recalled that the deep state in India refused this bargain, as well as Kashmiris. Hence, most Kashmiris inside Indian-occupied Kashmir and those working in the diaspora communities recognize that only a free, independent Pakistan will genuinely support its liberation movement. At the same time, the Kashmiri diaspora must develop a sophisticated approach to its global resistance while recognizing Pakistan's internal challenges and redlines without ceding control of the resistance to those who may bargain away their future, as those puppet Rajas (kings) in Pakistan have forsaken their own.\n\nThroughout the broader post-Arab Spring, the Middle East, of which Pakistan is part and parcel, the counter-revolutionary forces operate in conjunction with the deep state and global hegemony. That internal deep state, whether in the form of political parties, judiciary, police or military, undermines the emergence of representative democracy, human rights and the rule of law. Institutions are compromised, parliamentarians are bought, and courts are open at midnight to hear cases and enforce their will over parliamentary supremacy to protect the deep state elites' ill-gotten wealth and dubious fiefdoms.\n\nOne could reasonably argue that the deep state looks upon emerging democratic forces that challenge the status quo with both amusement and disdain. It will never willfully forgo the reins of power. However, it will do one better: Make space for emerging political forces to enter the political arena, then slowly undermine them.\n\nIn fact, the carrot of giving power is slowly weaponized to strip away at their aura, heighten instability, and spread fake news of \"nothing being done.\" This character assassination is subtle and meant to slowly undermine the emerging recalcitrant political order to make it a spent force. That is happening in emerging grassroots movements in the Middle East and is attempting to be done to Khan. So far, though, it has not worked.\n\nThere are many among the Pakistani people who support Khan and his team, and this is a promising development for both Pakistanis and Kashmiris.",
    "IMF Resumes its Extended Fund Facility for Pakistan": "The State Bank of Pakistan has finally received proceeds of $1.16 billion (the equivalent of SDR 894 million) after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Executive Board completed the combined 7th and 8th review under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) for Pakistan.\n\nWhile this tranche was much awaited ever since the Shehbaz Sharif government took power through a controversial in-house change on April 10, the results of this release so far are not clear. Since immediately after the IMF release, the Pakistani Rupee, which had earlier started to stabilize against the US $, has suddenly shown a downward trend – indicating perhaps that even the IMF tranche has not met market needs or other parallel developments are increasing pressures upon the country’s troubled economy.\n\nRead more: Pakistan Economic Survey 2021-22 unveiled\n\nThere is a longstanding background to current challenges. High international prices and delayed policy action worsened Pakistan’s fiscal and external positions in FY-22, leading to significant exchange rate depreciation and eroding foreign reserves. The loan approval comes as Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves (including those held by private commercial banks) stand at a mere $13.5 billion, as of August 19, according to the central bank. Weekly inflation touched 45 percent in August, according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, with food and fuel prices skyrocketing. In addition, Pakistan is confronting massive devastation caused by monsoon flooding that has left over 33 million people in desperation and taken the lives of over 1,300 people.\n\nPolitics around IMF\n\nPakistan has been in the IMF program since June 2019; it was never really suspended despite political debates on tv that create that misperception. It kept stalling because IMF would like to see the completion of commitments before the release of the new cache. Imran Khan’s government, before its removal, was confident that the next cache would have released around April. However, politics around IMF has continuously affected Pakistan’s relations with the monetary body. Public opinion has been shaped to see IMF as a threat to Pakistan or a conspiracy.\n\nShehbaz Sharif’s government, after much bickering and infighting, on July 13, 2022, finally reached a staff-level agreement on policies to complete the combined 7th and 8th reviews of Pakistan’s EFF. The agreement was subject to approval by the IMF’s Executive Board. However, despite a principled agreement, the situation kept dragging – and politics continued as usual.\n\nAlhamdolillah the IMF Board has approved the revival of our EFF program. We should now be getting the 7th & 8th tranche of $1.17 billion. I want to thank the Prime Minister @CMShehbaz for taking so many tough decisions and saving Pakistan from default. I congratulate the nation. — Miftah Ismail (@MiftahIsmail) August 29, 2022\n\nThe public has been unhappy because of strict decisions regarding fuel, power and commodity prices undertaken by the Shehbaz government to meet IMF conditions. The coalition partners have responded by accusing Imran Khan’s government of signing the agreement with the IMF on tough conditions and leaving the economy on the “verge of default.”\n\nRead more: Flour prices breaking the backs of citizens\n\nThe finance minister believes that the IMF agreement would help unleash $3.5 billion in further loans from Asian Development Bank, $2.5 billion in World Bank loans, and $500 million in Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank loans (AIIB). Moreover, the government is expecting to unlock further foreign economic assistance from various international creditors, in addition to flood relief aid from friendly countries and other financial institutions. However, given the country’s current overall socioeconomic situation, investors will remain cautious.\n\nOn the other hand, aftershocks of the revival of the IMF loan program are still to be surfaced. These are evident from the country report released by the Fund, including the Memorandum for Economic and Financial Policies—a document that is full of assurances given by Miftah Ismail on behalf of the government of Pakistan. The document was required to revive the program and extend it until June 2023 in order to get a total $3.5 billion loan from the IMF from August 2022 to June 2023. According to the report, Pakistan has assured the IMF that if revenue collection slows or current expenditures begin to exceed targets, the government will implement a contingency plan that involves both the imposition of new taxes and the reduction of federal and provincial development expenditures of Rs. 534 billion.\n\nNote: A slightly different version of this article appears in the 2022 September Magazine.",
    "'Honour killings' threaten women in Pakistan following devastating floods": "For nearly four decades, Ghotki District Police Inspector Saba Mirza has dedicated her life to investigating violent crimes against women, including murder, rape and so-called honour killings, known locally in the Sindhi language as Karo-Kari .\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the surface, Inspector Mirza carries herself with a warmth and generosity of spirit that bears no trace of the horrors she’s seen during her career. Now in charge of a district-level women’s protection unit in Pakistan’s Sindh province, she is clear and outspoken about the reasons behind the violence faced by some women in this part of Pakistan.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Poverty is high. The second problem is they consider women as being of a lower standard. They don’t value women here in this area. For petty things, men will be suspicious of them. And that results in honour killings,” she says.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGhotki district Women’s Protection Unit office.

Women accused of ‘dishonourable’ behaviour have been murdered, including by their relatives. The reasons given can include refusing a marriage, adultery, or just to settle disputes between tribal groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n“It could be something as trivial as a ringtone on their mobile phone, or standing out in a field on their own,” Inspector Mirza says.\n\n\n\nIt could be something as trivial as a ringtone on their mobile phone, or standing out in a field on their own. Saba Mirza, Police Inspector\n\nMore than 470 cases of honour killings were reported across the country in 2021, according to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, but the actual figure could be more than double. According to local women's rights organisation Sindh Suhai Sath, around 176 people, women and men, died in honour killings during the same year in Sindh province.\n\n\n\nGhotki District Police Inspector Saba Mirza. Credit: Aaron Fernandes, SBS News In 2016, the murder of Pakistani social media personality Qandeel Baloch by her brother Muhammad Waseem led to the introduction of mandatory life sentences for anyone guilty of committing Karo-Kari . The law was also changed to stop the practice of family members pardoning the perpetrators of honour killings under Islamic law.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile many religious groups in Pakistan - including the powerful Council of Islamic Ideology - which called the move \"un-Islamic\", opposed the changes to the law, the bill was passed by the country’s parliament only months later with wide public support.\n\n\n\nWaseem had openly admitted to strangling his sister, saying her social media presence was 'intolerable'. He received a life sentence for the crime, but it was widely reported in February he was acquitted. The BBC reported his lawyer said Waseem had retracted his confession and his parents had called for his release.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderreporting of Karo-Kari , as well as other forms of gender-based violence was already a major problem in Pakistan. But while inspector Mirza believes the frequency of honour killings in her community has reduced overall since the tightening of the laws, she now fears that months of rain and flooding across Pakistan will see even fewer violent crimes being reported.\n\n\n\nThe floods, which submerged a third of the country, have led to the deaths of more than 1,400 people and left millions homeless. People are now having to deal with water-borne diseases.\n\n\n\n\n\n“The women don’t come [to report violence perpetrated against them]. How would they come? Because water is so high, rains are so high, so they can’t come,” Inspector Mirza says.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Also, they have problems with transportation. How can they come? It has made a major difference, as coming here has become difficult for them.”\n\n\n\nGhotki District Deputy Superintendent of Police Hafiz Abdul Qadir Chachar SBS News spoke with two women from a village in Ghotki District who say they’ve seen multiple honour killings in and around the area.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn one incident more than ten years ago, a dispute over money in a village in rural Pakistan turned into a gunfight, and Naazan Bozdar was shot trying to protect her brother.

    "Alt News, Newslaundry come to defend Islamists, claim that Pakistan Zindabad slogans were not raised by PFI supporters": "On September 25, the self-proclaimed fact-checking website Alt News again came to rescue Islamists. This time, they attempted to give clean chit to the Popular Front of India members that were protesting in Pune. As per reports, videos of the protests organized by PFI members in Pune surfaced on social media platforms where they could be heard raising slogans of ‘Pakistan Zindabad.’ As the videos got traction on social media, the obvious saviours of Islamists, including Alt News and Newslaundry, came rushing to their rescue.\n\nAlt News shielded PFI workers raising “Pakistan Zindabad” slogans. Source: Twitter\n\nAlt News propaganda to twist the facts\n\nIn its report, Alt News talked about the protests that took place to oppose the raids by National Investigation Agency (NIA) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) on several locations linked to PFI in 15 states. During these raids, 106 PFI officials and workers were arrested by the investigating agency.\n\nThe protests were organized against the raids and arrests by PFI workers in multiple cities across the country in Pune. In the videos of the Pune protests, the members of PFI were heard raising slogans of ‘Pakistan Zindabad.’ Several netizens and prominent personalities on social media shared the videos and condemned the slogans. OpIndia had also covered the matter.\n\nAlt News, owing to its reputation, could not digest the fact that such slogans were raised. In their “explanation,” the portal said the slogans were not “Pakistan Zindabad” but “Popular Front Zindabad.” They even targeted those who condemned PFI workers for raising the slogans.\n\nThe portal shared a 26-second video and claimed that upon gathering videos from different sources, including journalists on the ground, they “found” that slogans were not “Pakistan Zindabad” but “Popular Front Zindabad.” They also shared a long video version of the protest recorded by Policenama.\n\nThe reality of the slogans\n\nOpIndia re-examined the videos, including the video shared by Policenama. There were multiple slogans that were being raised by the protesters. Among those slogans, ‘Nara-e-Takbeer Allah hu Akbar,’ ‘Popular Front Zindabad,’ and others were included. Now, the question is, was the slogan ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ raised? The answer is yes, the slogan was, in fact, raised.\n\nAt the 7:34 timestamp in the video, the slogan ‘Popular Front Zindabad’ can be easily heard. However, following the said slogan, ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ was also raised by the protesters.\n\nTwitter user Hawk Eye also published the analysis of the video and debunked Alt News claims. In his reply to Alt News, The Hawk Eye published the video compilation at three different speeds. He said, “Sharing the same video in a loop, with 3 different speed variations. The last part is with zoom to read the lip sync. Let ppl decide – “Pakistan” or “Popular front.”\n\nHawk Eye also slowed down the video and zoomed in on the PFI member who was detained by the Police and raised the controversial slogan. It was clearly evident that the slogan was, in fact, ‘Pakistan Zindabad.’\n\nSame vid with audio noise reduction. Observe the audio amplitude variation if its matching with “Pakistan” or “Polular Front”?\n\n2/ pic.twitter.com/YZzcYNWtCv — The Hawk Eye (@thehawkeyex) September 25, 2022\n\nAs there was a lot of background noise in the video, there was still a chance that the likes of Alt News may raise questions over the slogans raised. The Hawk Eye went ahead and cleared the background noise to make it clearer. In the three-speed variants of the audio with reduced background noise, the slogan ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ became more prominent.\n\nNewslaundry’s attempt to shield PFI\n\nA similar “fact-check” was done by the Leftist propaganda website Newslaundry. They quoted Pune Police, suggesting that no such slogans were raised, and shared the same video by Policenama as well. They talked to the protesters as well, who “denied” the allegations of raising ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ slogans.\n\nRJD leader shielded PFI\n\nWhile Alt News and Newslaundry were insisting that ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ slogans were not raised, RJD leader Shivanand Tiwari bluntly supported PFI workers and said such slogans are part of routine protests. He said that ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ slogans raised during a protest in favour of PFI were only a “sign of protest.” Tiwari’s comments came after over a hundred PFI activists were arrested in several states in a nationwide operation on Thursday, after which PFI workers had chanted Pakistan Zindabad slogans in Pune during a protest against the arrests.",

The dead were identified as Shanela, (7) and Samandar Ali Banger, (35), whereas the injured included Noor Jahan, Akhtar Ali, Ahmed Ali, Shabila and Farhan, reported Dawn.\n\nIn another similar incident, two people were killed in separate attacks in the Mashkel area of the Washuk district, reported Dawn.\n\nAccording to the Assistant Commissioner, Zahid Shahwani three armed men on a motorcycle opened fire at a man and ran away.\n\n“Three men were riding a motorbike when armed men opened fire and killed a person named Muhammad Bilal. A suspect was already in custody while the Levies force was searching for other attackers,” he added.\n\nThe other attack took place in the Bugg area where robbers killed truck driver Badr-i-Alam over resistance. They also took away his Iranian-made Zamyad vehicle loaded with Iranian oil. The driver, critically injured in the knife attack, later died of injuries while being moved to a hospital, reported Dawn.\n\nAccording to several reports, innocent Balochs are killed in fake encounters and their mutilated bodies are found in remote places.\n\nForceful abductions are being carried out in Balochistan since the early 2000s.\n\nAn annual report of the Human Rights Council of Balochistan, which is an organisation that documents human rights violations in the province, has said that students remain the main target of these kidnappings both in Balochistan as well as in other regions of Pakistan. The victims also include several political activists, journalists, teachers, doctors, poets, and lawyers.\n\nIn July, Pakistani security forces forcibly abducted 45 persons including 10 students. Fifteen people were released later while the whereabouts of 35 people remain unknown.\n\nJuly witnessed an increase in the cases of killings as compared to the previous months.\n\nHuman Rights Council of Balochistan documented 48 cases of killings, including five women while fourteen bodies remained unidentified.

    "India’s economy has outpaced Pakistan’s handily since Partition in 1947 – politics explains why": "India and Pakistan inherited the same economic legacy of underinvestment and neglect from Britain when they became independent states following the Partition on Aug. 15, 1947. Their colonial economies were among the poorest in the world.\n\nFor both nations, independence almost immediately led to strong growth and fueled significant gains in education, health care and other areas of development. But it was Pakistan that saw faster growth rates during the first four decades or so, while India lagged behind.\n\nSomething began to change around the 1990s as their roles reversed and India vaulted ahead of Pakistan, eventually becoming the world’s third-biggest economy by purchasing power and the “I” in BRICS – an acronym referring to a bloc of five key emerging market countries.\n\nWhat accounts for India’s growth spurt?\n\nAs a scholar of international political economy, I believe India’s stronger embrace of democracy – at the same time that Pakistan experienced frequent military dictatorships and changes in government – has a lot to do with it.\n\nA colonial inheritance\n\nFrom 1857 to 1947, Britain ruled directly over most of the territory that became the independent states of India and Pakistan.\n\nEconomic growth under British rule was minimal, averaging just 0.9% a year from 1900 to 1947. This happened largely because the colonial Indian economy was mostly agricultural, and yet the British made little investment in improving farm productivity.\n\nAdditionally, Great Britain made limited investments in the well-being of the people of India, notably by underfunding their education and health care. As a result, colonial India had one of the lowest literacy rates in the world at about 17%, and life expectancy was in the mid-30s. Britain’s neglect of the plight of Indians is perhaps best illustrated by the 1943 famine in Bengal in eastern India, in which over 1.5 million people died as result of policy failure.\n\nPost-independence growth, led by Pakistan\n\nBritain decided to give up its “jewel in the crown” and partition the region into Hindu-dominated India and Muslim Pakistan after facing mounting pressure from the local population and a growing nationalist movement.\n\nThis led to one of the largest forced migrations of the 20th century: Nearly 9 million Hindus and Sikhs moved into India and about 5 million Muslims to a geographically separated East and West Pakistan over the next two decades. An estimated 1 million people died amid mass violence.\n\nEconomic growth, however, took off, with both new countries growing at 3% to 4% in the first decade or so of independence as the respective governments invested more into their economies. But soon, differences emerged.\n\nWhile both economies were largely state controlled, India’s government curtailed exports and adopted a protectionist trading policy in the 1960s that limited growth.\n\nPakistan, on the other hand, benefited from significant trade from its East Pakistan region. The newly created Pakistan was geographically separated by India – on one side of it was West and the other side East Pakistan. Each was carved out by the British due to its Muslim majority. Pakistan lost its growth engine in 1971, when East Pakistan became Bangladesh following a war of independence.\n\nPakistan also received billions of dollars in military aid from the U.S. Fellow oil-rich Muslim countries in the Middle East have also given aid to Pakistan. As a result, Pakistan’s growth accelerated to about 6% a year from 1961 to 1980, compared with 4% for India.\n\nIndia vaults ahead\n\nThe growth script flipped in the 1990s, with India growing at a 6% rate over the next 30 years, outpacing Pakistan’s 4%.\n\nWhat explains the role reversal? Economics and politics both played a part.\n\nPakistan has long relied on external sources of funding more than India has, receiving $73 billion in foreign aid from 1960 to 2002. And even today, it frequently relies on institutions such as the International Monetary Fund for crisis lending and on foreign governments like China for aid and infrastructure development.\n\nThe aid has allowed Pakistan to postpone much-needed but painful reforms, such as expanding the tax base and addressing energy and infrastructure problems, while the loans have saddled the country with a large debt. Such reforms, in my view, would have put Pakistan on a more sustainable growth path and encouraged more foreign investment.\n\nWhile India also got a fair amount of support from international aid groups and a few countries such as the U.S. earlier in its existence, it never depended upon it – and has relied less on it in recent decades. In addition, in 1991, India liberalized trade, lowered tariffs, made it easier for domestic companies to operate and grow, and opened the door to more foreign investment.\n\nThese reforms paid off: By integrating India’s economy to the rest of the world, the reforms created market opportunities for Indian companies, made them more competitive, and that, in turn, led to higher growth rates for the overall economy.\n\nAnother way to measure the different paths is in gross domestic product per person. In 1990, India and Pakistan had almost identical per-capita GDPs, a little under $370 per person. But by 2021, India’s had surged to $2,277, about 50% higher than Pakistan’s.\n\nThe reasons for their different choices have a lot to do with politics.\n\nPakistan has suffered from near-constant political instability. From 1988 to 1998 alone, it had seven different governments as it alternated between civilian and military governments following coups. This discouraged foreign investment and made it much harder to make reforms and follow through on them. Through all these changes, Pakistan’s military spending as a share of its GDP remained higher than India’s during the entire post-independence period.\n\nIndia, on the other hand, has managed to maintain a steady democracy. Though it’s far from perfect, it has kept leaders more accountable to the people and led to more inclusive growth and less reliance on foreign institutions or governments. In one decade alone, India lifted over 270 million people out of poverty.\n\nAt a time when democracy is under threat in so many parts of the world, this history, in my view, reminds us of the value of democratic institutions.",
    "Pakistan raises concern over terrorism threat emanating from Afghanistan at UNGA": "New York [US], September 25 (ANI): During his remarks at the 77th United Nations General Assembly on Friday, Pakistan’s Prime Minister raised concern over the threat of terrorism emanating from Afghanistan.\n\nPakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said that “Pakistan shares the key concern of the international community regarding the threat posed by the major terrorist groups operating from Afghanistan especially Islamic State- Khorasan (ISIS-K) and Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), as well as Al-Qaeda, East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) and Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU),” reported Tolo News.\n\nSharif’s remarks sparked reactions from the Islamic Emirate and former President of Afghanistan Hamid Karzai. Karzai said in a statement that Afghanistan has been the victim of terrorism and that terrorist sanctuaries have been active under the Pakistani government in the country–and have been used against Afghanistan for decades, reported Tolo News.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan said that the allegations were baseless.\n\n“Some countries, including the United States and Pakistan, expressed concerns … that threat of terrorism still exists in Afghanistan,” the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.\n\n“These concerns, based on incorrect information and sources, are being brought up as the relevant parties are yet to hand over the seat of Afghanistan at the United Nations to its rightful, legal and political owners, the Afghan government,” added the statement.\n\nSpeaking at a gathering in Kabul, the acting foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi said that “biased circles in the world call Afghanistan a terrorist haven.”\n\nSharif also urged the Taliban to respect human rights and women’s rights, reported Tolo News.\n\nSince its ascent to power in Kabul, the Islamic group imposed policies severely restricting basic rights–particularly those of women and girls.\n\nAccording to Human Rights Watch (HRW), the Taliban dismissed all women from leadership posts in the civil service and prohibited girls in most provinces from attending secondary school.\n\nTaliban decrees prohibit women from travelling unless accompanied by a male relative and require women’s faces to be covered in public–including women TV newscasters.\n\nThe Taliban have also censored, limited critical reporting, and beaten journalists. Taliban forces have carried out revenge killings and enforced disappearances of former government officials and security force personnel. They have summarily executed people deemed affiliated with the Islamic State.\n\nArmed groups linked to the Afghan branch of the Islamic State have carried out bombings targeting ethnic Hazaras, Afghan Shias, Sufis, and others, killing and injuring hundreds.

    "Devastating floods in Pakistan": "21 September 2022\n\nTorrential monsoon rains triggered the most severe flooding in Pakistan’s recent history, washing away villages and leaving around 3.4 million children in need of assistance and at increased risk of waterborne diseases, drowning and malnutrition.\n\nAs floodwaters slowly recede, the sheer scale of damage is being revealed. Hundreds of thousands of homes have been damaged or destroyed, while many public health facilities, water systems and schools have been destroyed or damaged.

    "The west is ignoring Pakistan’s super-floods. Heed this warning: tomorrow it will be you": "Today, Pakistan, the world’s fifth-most-populous country, is fighting for its survival. This summer, erratic monsoon rains battered the country from north to south – Sindh, the southernmost province, received 464% more rain over the last few weeks than the 30-year average for the period.\n\nAt the same time, Pakistan’s glaciers are melting at a rate never seen before. These two consequences of the climate crisis have combined to create a monstrous super-flood that has ravaged the country.\n\nNinety per cent of crops in Sindh have been damaged; Faisal Edhi, who runs Pakistan’s largest social welfare organisation, the Edhi Foundation, has warned that those who don’t die from the floods risk death by starvation.\n\nA famine is coming; the only question is how soon? Economic losses are estimated to be in excess of $30bn, 50 million people have been internally displaced, there is the threat of a malaria epidemic as floodwater lies stagnant – satellite images have shown the shocking formation of a 100km-wide inland lake in Sindh due to overflowing from the Indus River – and there is no doubt that a generation will be cast backwards as already meagre education and health services are violently disrupted. More than 400 children have died and with winter coming and millions left without shelter, many more will.\n\nOur lives are dispensable for the world at large. What else can you feel when $880m was raised for Notre Dame but a drowning country must beg for aid?\n\nThis is a tragedy of nightmarish proportions and yet if you live outside Pakistan, you probably haven’t heard much about it. Given its near total lack of interest in the fate of Pakistan, it would seem that the rest of the world hasn’t considered that this epic humanitarian crisis is a peek into the apocalyptic future that awaits us all.\n\nNo nation need have any special feelings towards Pakistan, but the horrors faced by the country today are a clear warning of the consequences of universal and rapacious climate breakdown. Human beings have destroyed our one and only planet; what is happening in Pakistan today is proof of that.\n\nOur voracious burning of fossil fuels, obnoxious disregard for the wild and natural world we inherited, and criminal consumption means that no country, no matter its wealth, will be immune from the consequences of global heating. Today it is Pakistan, tomorrow it will be California, France, Australia, the world.\n\nWhile it has been touching to see how ordinary people from far away countries have shown solidarity with Pakistan, donating what they can to flood relief efforts, the silence from major international figures and western media at large has been dispiriting, if not unsurprising. The week the flood hit, there were more newspaper column inches devoted to a Finnish prime minister who likes to party than to the fact that a third of Pakistan was submerged.\n\nThis is not a question of disaster fatigue. In Europe, the same countries that pushed Syrian refugees out in rubber dinghies to die at sea have free Airbnb housing and welcome booths for Ukrainians at their airports. And it’s not that Pakistan is too dangerous to visit or deal with. Only recently, Bernard Henri Levy, the French pop intellectual, was strutting around Odessa and President Zelensky publicly thanked Ben Stiller and Angelina Jolie, “who, despite the danger, have visited us”. (To be fair to Jolie, she did visit Pakistan after the 2005 earthquake.)\n\nTemporary housing for flood victims in Sindh on Thursday. Photograph: Fareed Khan/AP\n\nThis is not our first disaster caused by the climate crisis. In 2010, Pakistan also suffered catastrophic flooding. At the time, the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said the scale of flooding Pakistan had endured was greater than anything he had ever seen before. “Make no mistake, this is a global disaster,” Moon said. “Pakistan is facing a slow-motion tsunami. Its destructive powers will accumulate and grow with time.”\n\nBack then, 400,000 cusecs of water made their way down the length of the Indus – a record-breaking amount. This year, we are expecting 700,000 cusecs.\n\nI remember being frantic back in 2010, trying desperately to raise attention to the disaster that was unfolding before our eyes. This was the same year that Haiti suffered a tragic earthquake, but unlike Haiti there was little media attention for Pakistan, no televised concerts populated by Hollywood stars wearing branded T-shirts and raising money, no tweets by major international figures applauding the resilience of the Pakistan people. No one cared then, just as no one cares now.\n\nThe current UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, has lamented that the world is “sleepwalking” through Pakistan’s devastating super-flood. If one takes climate change seriously, how can one be blind to Pakistan – a country that has already warmed a dreaded 2.2F?\n\nIn Jacobabad, Sindh, temperatures this summer reached 50 degrees Celsius (122F); it is “one of two cities on Earth that has passed heat and humidity thresholds that are hotter than the human body can handle”, as Vice reported. But where are the hordes of humanitarian opportunists who flex their care for war zones in Vanity Fair interviews and on Twitter?\n\nForget solidarity: the global south will not survive this century without climate justice. You in the west are talking about paper straws, we in the global south are talking about reparations.\n\nOur countries and our lives are dispensable for the world at large. We have always known this, but we are simmering with rage now. What else can you feel when $880m was raised in a day and a half after the cathedral of Notre Dame suffered a fire in 2021 but an entire country of drowning poor must beg for climate aid and assistance?\n\nIt’s time that the world wakes up to the terrifying future we have created for ourselves. We have no chance of surviving otherwise.",
    "Pakistan and the U.S. Have Made Up, but Will It Last?": "This marks a departure from a year ago, following the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan. Pakistan’s leaders saw the U.S. exit as poorly executed, and senior U.S. officials voiced their frustration at Pakistan for not having brought more weight to bear on the Afghan Taliban to reach a negotiated peace settlement with the former Ashraf Ghani-led government. Subsequent suggestions by U.S. officials that the relationship with Pakistan could be downgraded were viewed in Islamabad as petty punishment: partly for not having done more to help America in Afghanistan and partly for former Prime Minister Imran Khan’s ill-timed visit to Russia on the eve of its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nCalculating the full human and economic cost of Pakistan’s latest climate disaster will take time. But the crisis seems to have provided the Biden administration with the necessary justification for a diplomatic recommitment to the strategically situated, nuclear-armed country.\n\nAs millions of Pakistanis reel from the worst floods in living memory, national and international humanitarian rescue and relief efforts have coincided with a notable political development: a slow-but-steady resumption of high-level contact between Pakistan and the United States.\n\nAs millions of Pakistanis reel from the worst floods in living memory, national and international humanitarian rescue and relief efforts have coincided with a notable political development: a slow-but-steady resumption of high-level contact between Pakistan and the United States.\n\nCalculating the full human and economic cost of Pakistan’s latest climate disaster will take time.

Subsequent suggestions by U.S. officials that the relationship with Pakistan could be downgraded were viewed in Islamabad as petty punishment: partly for not having done more to help America in Afghanistan and partly for former Prime Minister Imran Khan’s ill-timed visit to Russia on the eve of its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBut when Khan began to accuse the United States of trying to engineer regime change in Pakistan, prompting a full-blown political crisis in Islamabad, Washington’s decision to hold off on further engagement became diplomatically prudent rather than vengeful.\n\nKhan has not shied away from cleaving his country’s relationship with the United States and the West more generally. After a no-confidence vote by Pakistan’s opposition parties, the ousted prime minister started staging megarallies across Pakistan’s cities. Despite the country’s worst monsoon in decades, he has continued to foment popular unrest, demonizing the new coalition government that replaced him and accused the Pakistan Army of politicization.\n\nAlthough Khan’s allegations of U.S. regime change are far-fetched, there remains some truth to the claim that it was the Pakistan Army’s withdrawal of its support for Khan that prompted April’s change in government. The Army initially helped pave the way for Khan’s electoral victory in 2018, but it is said to have been increasingly aggravated by the high costs of Khan’s populist politics, which often used anti-American sentiment to whip up domestic support.\n\nIn contrast to Khan, the Pakistan Army sees ties with the United States as central to Pakistan’s geopolitical relevance and key to stabilizing a worsening economy and acute liquidity crisis. To this end, one of the first measures taken by the Shehbaz Sharif-led coalition government that replaced Khan’s was to overturn Khan’s unfunded fuel and electricity subsidies. This was so Pakistan could resume negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), following a seven-month hiatus, over a $6.5 billion program.\n\nFor Washington’s part, in addition to the resumption of the IMF program, there are other signs of a willingness to revive ties. Devastating floods have been accompanied by a flurry of high-profile official visits from Washington: first by State Department counselor Derek Chollet, who announced a 10-day humanitarian air bridge to Pakistan and a $30 million relief package, and then a strategically timed visit by U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator Samantha Power, who took the time to field questions at a press conference in Islamabad to Pakistani journalists. Even though the pretext for the two visits was largely humanitarian in nature, both officials spoke about the significance of 75 years of bilateral relations between the two countries as well as the importance of deepening ties.\n\nAlmost simultaneously, the State Department announced the approval of the potential sale of F-16 aircraft sustainment and related equipment to Pakistan in a deal valued at up to $450 million, with the objective of servicing joint counterterrorism objectives. This decision overturns an earlier decision by the former Trump administration to end the technological and technical support program for the Pakistani fleet. The summer also saw the appointment of a full-time career ambassador to Pakistan after a gap of four years. (The last career ambassador relinquished his charge in 2018.)\n\nIt is virtually impossible to delink the ostensible sea change in America’s willingness to engage with Pakistan to the change in government that transpired this summer. Possibly in a bid to rebuild ties with the Pakistani establishment, Khan is said to now be contemplating softening his party’s extreme stance on the United States. Interestingly enough, it didn’t help that this hard-line position also didn’t sit comfortably with a sizable Pakistani-American diaspora that forms a key part of Khan’s base and which willingly sends remittances back to support the economy. As part of what may be called an internal reset, former U.S. diplomat and lobbyist Robin Raphel met with Khan at his Bani Gala residence this week, albeit in a private capacity. And in an interview to a top television anchor at around the same time, Khan said he was not opposed to Pakistan enjoying a good relationship with the United States, though he added that Pakistan “should not be used like we were used during the war on terror.”\n\nKhan will have to continue to define the parameters of what he considers acceptable in the relationship. In a 2021 television interview, for instance, Khan said Pakistan would “absolutely not” allow the CIA to use bases on its soil for cross-border counterterrorism missions once U.S. forces withdrew from Afghanistan. Although that sentiment is largely shared by parties across the Pakistani political spectrum, high-ranking officials between the two countries have held exploratory discussions about ways to bolster security and counterterrorism mechanisms in the region. It remains to be seen what those mechanisms could look like, but there are a few possibilities. Last month, the United States killed al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in a drone strike in Afghanistan that prompted the Afghan Taliban to accuse Pakistan of allowing its airspace to be used for the strike.\n\nPakistan’s foreign office deftly sidestepped the allegation; still, the resumption of the sale of F-16 spare parts to Pakistan is likely to reinvigorate the conversation around the extent and potential of Pakistani-U.S. counterterrorism cooperation and the Pakistan Army’s willingness to let America back into the country on the ground and in its skies. The Pakistan Army no doubt sees the upside as leveraging counterterrorism cooperation to target Pakistani Taliban militants operating from Afghanistan. The government, meanwhile, would like to maximize international assistance to rebuild Pakistan’s economy and infrastructure devastated by recent and ongoing flooding.\n\nA partnership could potentially have considerable benefits for the United States. By reengaging Pakistan, the United States will diversify its investments in South Asia and in the Indo-Pacific. This may be valuable given India’s insistence that it be allowed to maintain ties with Russia despite the war in Ukraine, which could in time lead some in Washington to privately question India’s long-term reliability as a key American partner in the Indo-Pacific. Although India remains an important partner for the United States for the most part, the United States has been unsuccessful in trying to coax a change in India’s position on Russia. Thus far, U.S. officials have been standing firm on their sale of F-16 spare parts to Pakistan despite criticism from India—signaling perhaps that they too are not averse to hedging.\n\nBack in Pakistan, Khan is savvy enough to recognize a shift in attitudes. It is likely that as temperatures cool and the floodwaters slowly recede, Khan may, somewhat begrudgingly, modulate his anti-U.S. rhetoric. The catch is that Khan actually remains massively popular in Pakistan, and it is widely expected that he will return to power in the next general election—with or without the establishment’s support. A key question for the Pakistan Army, then, is whether it wants Khan in power as a friend or as a foe. The latter would be bad for civil-military relations in the country, and it would also be singularly unhelpful for the country’s longer-term efforts to resuscitate its complicated relationship with America.",
    "Pakistan deserves reparations for a catastrophe caused by rich countries | Letter": "Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar’s article (Rich countries caused Pakistan’s catastrophic flooding. Their response? Inertia and apathy, 5 September) underlines the scale of the catastrophe that has befallen Pakistan, and is a clear call by an eminent spokesperson from the global south for reparations to be paid by the rich world to countries directly affected by the climate crisis. Some may question the moral case for saying that rich countries must, in effect, admit guilt and cover the costs of catastrophes that occur far away, especially when these same countries are already committed to funding mitigation measures through forums such as Cop26 in Glasgow last year.\n\nThere is an important distinction here, however. Cop26 payments – which are still far from being implemented – will allow poorer countries to put in place infrastructure and other measures to reduce the worst impacts of the crisis now affecting all of us. Mr Khokhar is arguing for additional payments in compensation for damages caused by those who have created the climate crisis and its consequent catastrophes.\n\nPakistan contributes less than 1% in global emissions and has played almost no part in creating the climate crisis. The mass of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere has been accumulating since at least 1850, when the global north began burning coal and oil to fuel its industrialisation and drive the imperialism that enabled it to extract vast resources from countries now seriously affected by climate change. Like anyone who causes damage to his or her neighbour, and has been living well off their resources, we should accept the blame and pay up accordingly.\n\nChristopher Tanner\n\nLlandovery, Carmarthenshire",
    "US, Pakistan re-engage to cope with floods, rebuild ties": "WASHINGTON: Pakistan and the United States will hold ministerial-level talks in Washington on Monday (today), indicating willingness on part of both sides to resume institutionalised engagement after a long absence.\n\nForeign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari reached Washington on Sunday on a three-day visit during which he will hold in person talks with Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\n\nHe will also have a separate meeting with State Department’s Special Rep­re­sentative for Commercial and Business Affairs Dilawar Syed, reflecting a mutual desire to deepen trade ties between the two old allies. He is also meeting key Cong­ressional leaders on the Hill.\n\nOfficially, both sides have only forwarded a generic description of the talks, saying meetings would “highlight flood relief efforts in Pakistan and commemorate 75 years of bilateral relations”.\n\nAt an earlier briefing to Dawn, State Department’s counselor Derek Chollet acknowledged that the United States wanted to maintain friendly ties with Pakistan and was even ready to compete with China to do so.\n\nBut he also said that in doing so, the Biden administration does not want Islamabad to choose between Beijing and Washington, rather it wants countries “to be able to have a choice”. The United States, he said, was not “afraid of competing with China, but we would like to have a fair competition”.\n\nThis clearly illustrates a sketch of the relationship Washington wants with Islamabad, a close ally, which can maintain its special relationship with China without allowing it to affect its ties with the United States.\n\nBut the issue that’s going to dominate the talks is the one that was not even there when these talks were planned: this year’s unprecedented floods that have brought Pakistan close to an economic meltdown.\n\nPakistan is seeking, but not getting, international assistance that matches the scale of the disaster that befell the country this summer.\n\nEditorial: Funding gaps\n\nMichael Kugelman, Director of South Asia Institute at Washington’s Wilson Centre, said in a tweet on Sunday that during a recent trip to Pakistan, “the main message I heard on the floods is that the only hope is international aid, which has been slow to come”.\n\nBut the “biggest obstacle to addressing the crisis may not be the lack of international aid, but political polarisation at home,” he wrote.\n\nMadiha Afzal, a Pakistan scholar at Brookings, another Washington think tank, also highlighted this issue in her tweet. “Pakistan’s political polarisation is so hardened now that nothing seems to be able to reduce it — not its flooding catastrophe, nor anything else,” she wrote. “Doesn’t bode well.”\n\nSome experts warn that this could also impact efforts to rebuild US-Pakistan ties as scholars and policy makers in Washington also worry about the stability of the current political setup in Islamabad.\n\nAnd as the two scholars indicated, this was already affecting Islamabad’s efforts to raise funds for the relief and rehabilitation of flood victims.\n\nIn his speeches and statements at the UN General Assembly this week, Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif not only appealed to the international community to help Pakistan but also assured them that the funds they send would be used for the victims only. Apparently, he did so to assure the donors that the aid would not be misappropriated, as some of them fear.\n\nExperts say that in their talks in Washington, Pakistan would not only seek, and probably get, more assistance but would also ask for US support to its efforts to reschedule its debt. In his engagements at the UN, the prime minister minced no words in reminding the donors that “all hell may break lose” if Pakistan does not get debt relief.\n\nMr Chollet, when asked if the United States would help Pakistan in getting its debt rescheduled, said Washington was aware of the situation but he did “not want to get ahead of an official US decision” on this issue.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 26th, 2022",
    "Pakistan authorities breach lake to save other areas from floods": "Authorities in flood-hit Pakistan have breached the country’s largest freshwater lake, displacing up to 100,000 people from their homes but saving more densely populated areas from gathering flood water, a minister said.\n\nRecord monsoon rains and melting glaciers in Pakistan’s northern mountains have brought floods that have affected 33 million people and killed at least 1,290, including 453 children. The inundation, blamed on climate breakdown, is still spreading.\n\nLake Manchar, which is used for water storage, had already reached dangerous levels and the increased pressure posed a threat to surrounding areas in southern Sindh province, said the region’s irrigation minister, Jam Khan Shoro.\n\nHe said about 100,000 people would be affected by the breach but it would help save more populated clusters and also reduce water levels in other, harder-hit areas.\n\n“By inflicting the breach we have tried to save Sehwan town. Water levels on Johi and Mehar towns in Dadu district would be reduced by this breach in the lake,” Shoro told Reuters.\n\nIt was not clear how many of the 100,000 asked to leave their homes would actually do so.\n\nSome displaced by the floods have complained that shelters are crowded, while others are reluctant to leave their possessions.\n\nAside from historic rainfall, southern Pakistan has had to contend with increased flooding as a surge of water flowed down the Indus River.\n\nThe country has already received nearly three times the 30-year average rainfall in the quarter through August, totalling 390.7mm (15.38in). Sindh province, with a population of 50 million, was hardest hit, getting 464% more rain than the 30-year average.\n\nBeing downstream on the Indus River, the southern parts of the country have experienced swelling river waters flowing from the north. Pakistan’s limited dams and reservoirs are already overflowing and cannot be used to stop downstream flows.\n\nTarbela dam in the north-west has been at capacity – 1,550ft and 5.8m acre ft – for weeks, according to National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) data. Downstream in Sindh, barrages are under pressure with the Indus at high flood level, the NDMA said in its latest situation report.\n\nAuthorities are also prepared for more rain in the north over the next few days until Tuesday. “Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has forecasted that weak monsoon currents from Arabian Sea are penetrating upper and central parts of the country which subsequently cause rain-wind/thundershowers,” the NDMA said.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The United Nations children’s agency, Unicef, said there was a risk of “many more” child deaths from disease.\n\nPakistan’s prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, on Sunday appealed to Unicef and other global agencies to help control child deaths. “As Pakistan battles one of the worst climate-induced calamities, among the most adversely affected are children,” Sharif tweeted.\n\nOn Sunday, flights carrying aid from Unicef, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates landed in Pakistan.",
    "Pakistan International Airlines Welcomes 3rd Airbus A320 This Year": "Pakistan International Airlines has inducted another Airbus A320 into its fleet. The plane is the third A320 to join PIA this year as part of a deal with AerCap, with the fourth and final A320 expected next week.\n\nPIA bolsters fleet with another A320\n\nPakistani flag carrier Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has welcomed the third Airbus A320 to its fleet this year. The Airbus A320-200 (registration: AP-BMV) arrived in Islamabad on September 23rd following a short flight from Sharjah.\n\nThe 10-year-old A320 entered service under Middle East Airlines (MEA) in 2012 before being withdrawn from use in March 2020. PIA's A320s are configured in an all-economy layout with 174 seats.\n\nPIA will have 14 Airbus A320s by the end of the month. Photo: Aasif Azaan via Wikimedia Commons\n\nThis is the third jet to arrive from a deal with leasing giant AerCap for four A320s, with the final aircraft (registration: AP-BMY) due in the coming days. The first A320 from AerCap arrived in April, followed by a second in July.\n\nCommenting on the arrival of the A320, PIA CEO Arshad Malik said the new aircraft would replace outgoing planes with expired leases and offer an improved travel experience for passengers.\n\nExpensive leasing fees?\n\nAlong with its four A320s from AerCap, the rest of PIA's A320 fleet is on lease. The Pakistani carrier now has 13 Airbus A320s, soon to be 14 when its fourth and final jet arrives from AerCap.\n\nIn June, Simple Flying reported on PIA paying $600,000 a month for two A320s stuck in Jakarta. These two A320s, not part of the above AerCap deal, were leased back in 2015 from Asia Aviation Capital.\n\nCan PIA live up to its plan of achieving profitability by 2024? Photo: Anna Zvereva via Flickr\n\nUpon undergoing a third-party inspection in late 2021, a disagreement broke out between PIA and the lessor regarding the condition of the two aircraft, which apparently had not undergone proper C-checks. The planes are reportedly still on the ground, and legal proceedings have been opened.\n\nPIA recently reported losses of Rs41.8 billion ($514 million) for the first half of 2022, amounting to more than double the airline's overall 2021 losses of $244 million.\n\nDiscover more aviation news with Simple Flying.\n\nNew widebodies incoming\n\nEarlier this month, PIA revealed its plans to add another five widebody aircraft to its fleet. The airline hopes to conclude a dry leasing agreement for five planes with a capacity of between 250 and 320 passengers.\n\nThe Pakistani carrier is still undergoing the recertification process in Europe, which would offer a big boost to revenues should it prove successful. Upcoming audits by the International Aviation Safety Assessment (IASA) and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) will determine whether PIA can return to European skies.\n\nHave you flown with Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) this year?

    "WHO Director-General's statement on Pakistan – 17 September 2022": "I am deeply concerned about the potential for a second disaster in Pakistan: a wave of disease and death following this catastrophe, linked to climate change, that has severely impacted vital health systems leaving millions vulnerable. The water supply is disrupted, forcing people to drink unsafe water, which can spread cholera and other diarrhoeal diseases. Standing water enables mosquitoes to breed and spread vector- borne diseases such as malaria and dengue. Health centres have been flooded, their supplies damaged, and people have moved away from home which makes it harder for them to access their normal health services. All this means more unsafe births, more untreated diabetes or heart disease, and more children missing vaccination, to name but a few of the impacts on health.\n\nBut if we act quickly to protect health and deliver essential health services, we can significantly reduce the impact of this impending crisis. Health workers in Pakistan are stretched to the limit as they do all they can to deliver critical services amid the destruction. Nearly 2000 health facilities have been fully or partially damaged. Together with the government of Pakistan, UN and NGO partners, WHO is setting up temporary health facilities and medical camps and helping to re-supply medicines to other health centres. We are increasing disease surveillance so outbreaks can be detected early and people can get the treatment they need.\n\nGovernment and partners are providing safe drinking water and access to toilets to lower the risks of disease from dirty water. WHO has provided water purification kits and oral rehydration salts to manage diarrhoeal diseases. Partners are also helping ensure safer housing and bed nets to protect against mosquitoes and the diseases they carry.\n\nWHO immediately released US$10 million from the WHO Contingency Fund for Emergencies which enabled us to deliver essential medicines and other supplies.\n\nI thank the donors for their prompt response to the flash appeal. We continue to assess the scale of the crisis and will issue a revised appeal shortly. I urge donors to continue to respond generously so that, together, we can save lives and prevent more suffering."
