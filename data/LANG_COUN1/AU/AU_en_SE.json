    "Sweden proves it: The Left must change": "Sweden has got a new government, a bourgeois one but with the addition of the far-right Sweden Democrats.\n\nWhat does this mean for Sweden and perhaps even Europe’s future?\n\nThe most interesting issues for the Swedish voters in this election was gang violence, integration and, to some extent, electricity prices. There is no point hiding from the fact that the new right-wing alliance gave the most persuasive answers, which has in turn gotten them in power, to put it simply.\n\nSocio-cultural issues are more interesting than socio-economic ones and have given the Left very little space and success. The climate crisis has been turned into a background issue by politicians as much as by the media. Greta Thunberg’s perennial attention to politicians who postpone the problems to the future is proven true repeatedly.\n\nIt is not possible to call a million Sweden Democratic voters racists or Nazis and believe that they will then change their opinion and join a progressive and politically correct side that mocks them.\n\nThe techno-feudal situation with surveillance capitalism and how finance and capital have gone their separate ways and the old capitalism is about to be replaced by an even more remote and oligarchic order, no one even knows about and even less can choose to pay attention to.\n\nThe forecast is that people will continue to pay attention to what concerns the first level of human needs: safety and security, money that keeps flowing in, expenses that are not allowed to increase and passable highways free of sitting climate activists, because we want to get to work on time.\n\nIt is not possible to replace natural laws and, for example, believe that people whose children have been drawn into gang violence should first start thinking about what a post-capitalist world could mean. Nor is it possible to call a million Sweden Democratic voters racists or Nazis and believe that they will then change their opinion and join a progressive and politically correct side that mocks them.\n\nTen years of persistent grinding on the same strategy has been a disaster for the progressives in particular.\n\nCredibility, clarity and respect for people’s concerns are some human qualities that are always needed if you want others to listen to you – this also applies to grassroots democracy.\n\nThe question then is what DiEM25 could do in this crass political market where other parties in Sweden are increasing, where dissatisfaction is increasing and voter turnout is falling.\n\nThere is widespread dissatisfaction with people who see their petrol prices skyrocket because a few politicians believe that we must reduce fossil emissions.\n\nShake hands with them and say that we also think it is unfair and that we want the policy to compensate so that you are in the same boat when we have to help each other with the climate problem.\n\nThere is a hidden dissatisfaction with immigrants and the idea that they contribute to gang violence and shootings in the suburbs.\n\nShake hands with them and tell them we make no distinction when it comes to judging murderers. We can agree that everyone is equal before the law, while also admitting that certain communities need more help than others in order to be defended from a life of crime.\n\nNo progressive needs to lose their core values ​​if they want to approach our fellow unaffected citizens.\n\nToday, Swedish young people vote for Conservatives and the Sweden Democrats, the revolution is blue and if you want to use the momentum that has been built up, it is not time to withdraw and wait for another political wind.\n\nBeing progressive needs to be redefined. Several right-wing nationalist leaders in Europe welcome the Sweden Democrats’ success as a wave of nationalism that confirms themselves. A brave new progressive force may and must change this. A new progressive objective is necessary that can carve a new space for progressive politics among the Left’s old voting base as well as become a new attractive grass root magnet placing the current guardians of political status quo in the shadows.\n\nMats Sederholm\n\nCoordinator Stockholm Local Collective\n\nMember of DiEM25 Press Team\n\nWriter and active for Klimatalliansen\n\nEmail: mats@sederholm.nu\n\nDo you want to be informed of DiEM25's actions?

    "Poland welcomes right-wing election successes in Italy and Sweden": "Leading figures from Poland’s ruling camp, including Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, have welcomed the electoral success of right-wing and far-right parties in Italy yesterday, as well as in Sweden’s recent election.\n\nImmediately after exit polls last night predicted a victory for the Brothers of Italy (FdI) party – which sits in the same European grouping as Poland’s ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party – Morawiecki tweeted congratulations to Giorgia Meloni, FdI’s leader and the likely new Italian prime minister.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, with FdI predicted to win the election, Morawiecki had declared himself “happy that a tremor is running through the EU”, reported the Polish Press Agency (PAP).\n\nWith the likely new governments in Italy and Sweden – where the nationalist Sweden Democrats are now the second largest party – “watching the interests of nation-states…Europe is becoming a Europe of real values”, said Morawiecki.\n\nPiS chairman Jarosław Kaczyński had also declared Sunday to be “a day of hope, hope that the EU will start to change”, reports news website wPolityce.\n\nJarosław Kaczyński: Wybory we Włoszech? Jest nadzieja na to, że UE zacznie się zmieniać. Dzisiaj jest dzień takiej nadzieihttps://t.co/VFER1wme9V — wPolityce.pl (@wPolityce_pl) September 25, 2022\n\nMorawiecki’s predecessor as prime minister, Beata Szydło, who is now a PiS MEP, also tweeted congratulations to Meloni and FdI in Polish, English and Italian. Polish deputy foreign minister Paweł Jabłoński hailed FdI’s “historic victory”.\n\nDeputy justice minister Michał Wójcik, who belongs to PiS’s hard-right junior coalition partner United Poland (Solidarna Polska), said that Meloni’s victory was a “defeat for [European Commission President Ursula] von der Leyen, the representative of the anti-democratic forces in the EU”.\n\n“Abnormality in the EU is ending,” declared Wójcik. “The rule of manipulators and lunatics in the European Commission is slowly coming to an end.”\n\nPrzedstawicielka antydemokratycznych sił w UE von der Leyen doznała klęski. Prawica wygrywa wybory we Włoszech! Kończy się nienormalność w UE. Kończą się powoli rządy manipulantów i szaleńców w KE.\n\n🇮🇹🇵🇱 — Michał Wójcik🇵🇱 (@mwojcik_) September 25, 2022\n\nFigures from Poland’s ruling camp had criticised von der Leyen in recent days for suggesting that the EU would use “tools” against Italy, as it had with Hungary and Poland, “if things go in a difficult direction”.\n\nAnother United Poland figure, MEP Patryk Jaki, also hailed “Italians [for] not allowing themselves to be blackmailed by the EU” and achieving “a great victory for the right”.\n\nThe Polish government’s response was, however, criticised by opposition MP Agnieszka Pomaska. “The elections in Italy are won by…the post-fascist Meloni, the pro-Russian [Matteo] Salvini and the discredited Berlusconi,” she tweeted. “And the United Right [Polish ruling coalition] crows with delight.”\n\n❌Wybory we Włoszech wygrywa prawicowa koalicja z postfaszystowską kandydatką na premiera Meloni, prorosyjskimi Salvinim i skompromitowanym Berlusconim. A Zjednoczona Prawica na czele z Kaczyńskim pieje z zachwytu. Jaka partia tacy sojusznicy. — Agnieszka Pomaska (@pomaska) September 25, 2022\n\nBoth PiS and FdI are part of the European Conservatives and Reformists Party (ECR), which seeks reform of the EU in the direction of a looser union of sovereign member states and opposes further integration.\n\nIn recent years, PiS has also sought to forge closer links with Salvini’s Lega party, as well as other right-wing and far-right forces in the EU, such as France’s Marine Le Pen.\n\nHowever, since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine such efforts have been put on hold, publicly at least, given that those parties’ generally sympathetic position towards the Kremlin is at odds with PiS’s strongly anti-Russian line.\n\nMain image credit: Santi_ABASCAL/Twitter",
    "7 Fascinating Facts About Gothenburg, Sweden’s Second City": "As Sweden's second biggest city, Gothenburg has a rich cultural life but a more relaxed pace than ... [+] the capital city Stockholm. getty\n\nIn many ways Gothenburg could be considered the heart of Scandinavia. It’s Sweden’s second biggest city, has a 3.5-hour ferry connection to Denmark and is just a 2-hour drive from Norway.\n\nFrom its status as a global leader in sustainability to a fascinating history of trade and innovation, there’s a lot to discover about Gothenburg. Here are seven fascinating facts about this thriving Scandinavian city.\n\nThe city isn’t actually called Gothenburg\n\nIn Swedish the city is named Göteborg, roughly pronounced yaw-ta-bore(g). This surprises many international visitors as all other Swedish cities use the same name in both languages. To add to the confusion, many business in Gothenburg use the English version in their name.\n\nThe city council has changed its mind over the years about its own branding. In 2003, it was decided to promote the name Göteborg, a decision which was reversed just six years later. Now Gothenburg is the preferred choice for all international communications.\n\nIt’s the fifth largest city in the Nordic region\n\nWhile Gothenburg plays second fiddle to Stockholm in Sweden, it’s a big player in the context of the wider Nordic region.\n\nGothenburg is the fifth largest city in the Nordic region. Getty\n\nWith almost 600,000 people living in the city and about 1.1 million people in the wider urban area, Gothenburg is the biggest Nordic city that’s not the capital of its country. It’s also significantly bigger than Iceland’s capital, Reykjavik.\n\nGothenburg was built by the Dutch\n\nAlthough people have lived in the area for thousands of years, the city of today was founded in 1621 by the King of Sweden. However, the city’s early success relied on construction expertise from the Netherlands.\n\nBased on the Dutch experience of building on marshlands and constructing canals, the planning of Gothenburg’s streets and necessary canals followed that of Amsterdam and Dutch colonies of the time, particularly Batavia (now Jakarta).\n\nThe city is a leader in innovative transport\n\nIn 1927, the first Volvo car rolled off the production line in Gothenburg. Since then, Volvo went on to become a global leader in people-first and safety-first design.\n\nThe Volvo Museum exhibits products from the whole Volvo range, including cars, trucks and buses. getty\n\nWhile Volvo Cars was sold to Ford in 1999, Gothenburg remains the headquarters of the Volvo Group that continues to manufacture trucks and buses including new 44-ton electric trucks. The city’s Volvo Visitor Center and Volvo Museum tell the story.\n\nToday, Gothenburg is writing a new chapter in its transport story. Leading electric aircraft developer Heart Aerospace has chosen Gothenburg as its base to create the so-called Northern Runway, a campus of production and flight test facilities.\n\nGotheburg is twinned with Chicago\n\nOf Chicago’s 28 sister cities, Gothenburg is the only one in the Nordic region. Launched in 1960, the sister cities program works on collaborations in the areas of cultural arts and tourism, global education, government relations and international business.\n\nGothenburg is a sustainability leader\n\nA committment to sustainability is a thread that runs through every aspect of life in Gothenburg, from business to tourism. In 2021, Lonely Planet recognized Gothenburg as the world’s most sustainable city break, while the Global Destination Sustainability Index ranked Gothenburg as the world’s most sustainable destination five years in a row.\n\nGothenburg was the first city in the world to issue green bonds to stimulate investment in solutions to climate change. Almost all the city’s hotels are eco-certified and plans to develop a zero-emissions transport zone in the downtown district are well underway.\n\nThe city’s archipelago is vast\n\nAbout 5,000 people live on Gothenburg’s southern archipalego, but that number rises to more than 10,000 during the summer months.\n\nBoats and bicycles are the primary form of transport in Gothenburg’s southern archipelago. getty\n\nMany Swedes own vacation cottages and spend several weeks on one of the islands, while many more spend weekends there throughout the year.\n\nIn keeping with the city’s sustainability focus, the southern archipelago is entirely car-free. Ferries connect people with the mainland, while bicycles and delivery mopeds are used on the islands.\n\nWhile the islands are forward-thinking, they are also steeped in history. Mentioned in Norse sagas as ‘the river islets’, the southern islands appear to have been used as a location for fairs and duels in the Viking Age.\n\nThe northern archipelago shares much in common with its southern sibling, but has bigger islands and communities accessible by car via the car ferries from Lilla Varholmen. The weekend ferry to Hönö Klåva from downtown Gothenburg is especially popular.",
    "How The Local Sweden uses product thinking to remain \"useful\" to readers": "News organisations around the world are starting to pay attention to their readers’ needs and adopt a user-first model.\n\nThat is the case for The Local, a news outlet for English-speaking expats, published in nine European countries.\n\nIts Swedish edition uses reader surveys and audience data to create editorial products that its readers want and need.\n\nRead more: How BBC World Service engages younger audiences by fulfilling six reader needs\n\nSure, \"product thinking\" is a piece of jargon. What it really means, according to Paul O'Mahony, editorial product manager at The Local Sweden, is simply to make sure the publication is useful to its readers.\n\n\"Why do people buy products? It’s to fill a need or solve a problem in their lives,\" he said in a Journalism.co.uk podcast.\n\nThe \"product\" in product thinking can be anything, from a new article series to a podcast or a comic. The key to success is to provide your readers with valuable information they cannot find elsewhere.\n\nThe Local's membership is a good example, giving subscribers unlimited access to all nine editions. Throughout the pandemic, the news website has become a go-to source of coronavirus updates where authorities do not communicate in English a lot. Subscriptions have grown from 13k to 50k over the past two years.\n\nEditions from different countries collaborate all the time, swapping tips and stories, so individual publications can benefit from a much larger pool of audience data. One example of a successful new product launched in several countries is the \"Word of the day\" series that explains a local word to foreigners.\n\nAnother example is a monthly \"What changes\" article series where The Local Sweden informs foreign residents about upcoming changes in legislation or other areas of public life that could affect them. Originally created in France, the series was a hit with existing users and it also helped convert new readers into subscribers.\n\nProduct thinking is not limited to written articles. Podcast \"Sweden in focus\", created a year ago, answers listeners' needs with a solutions mindset. At a time when the right-wing populist parties are on the rise, O'Mahony is looking at projects that worked elsewhere and lessons we can learn from them.\n\nPodcasts are good for subscription conversions too; 65 per cent of listeners are paying members, of whom 60 per cent say the podcast makes them more likely to renew their membership. Among non-members, half say the podcast is making them consider signing up.\n\nRead more: 'Actionable user needs' make for more efficient newsrooms\n\nTo know whether a product is successful, The Local runs user surveys and makes changes based on readers’ feedback. The make-up of its team gives the publication a head start as most journalists are expats themselves and can use their experience to figure out what the readers may need.\n\nSurveys, on the other hand, tend to ask practical questions and often help journalists unearth new topics or angles they did not think about before.\n\n\"We had an email from a reader last week who said the cost of living made them reconsider their subscriptions. They are going to cut Netflix and a few other things but they said they will never cut The Local because that was their most important subscription. And that’s where we want to be in people’s lives.\"\n\nListen to the full Interview with Paul O'Mahony here.\n\nFree daily newsletter\n\nIf you like our news and feature articles, you can sign up to receive our free daily (Mon-Fri) email newsletter (mobile friendly).",

    "Thursday briefing: What’s behind Sweden’s lurch to the right": "Good morning. Last night, a nail biting election in Sweden that went down to the last postal votes finally reached its conclusion: the Social Democrat prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, conceded defeat to a conservative bloc including the far-right Sweden Democrats (SD). Jimmie Akesson (above), the SD’s leader, said it was time to “make Sweden good again”.\n\nIt was no landslide victory, the right wing coalition only won a majority of three out of 349 seats. And centre-right parties have said that the SD will not be given ministerial power. But the fact remains that a radical party which emerged from violent neo-Nazi groups in the 1980s is now the second-biggest grouping in Sweden’s parliament, and the largest on the right, with more than 20% of the vote.\n\nThe SD have sought to move away from their ethno-nationalist past, instead portraying themselves as any other nationalist conservative party. They even changed their logo from a flaming torch with the Swedish flag emblazoned on it to a yellow and blue flower, because what indicates deradicalisation like a nice flower? But given the party’s history, and hardline stance on immigration and crime, their success has already caused real alarm.\n\nFor today’s newsletter, I spoke to journalist and University of Glasgow sociology lecturer Dominic Hinde, a Sweden expert who has been travelling around the country since June, and David Crouch, who has been covering the election for the Guardian, about how Sweden got here. That’s after the headlines.\n\nFive big stories\n\nIn depth: How a liberal Nordic nation changed course\n\nSwedish prime minister Magdalena Andersson announcing her resignation last night. Photograph: Jessica Gow/TT News Agency/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBefore their success forced the resignation of Magdalena Andersson (above) last night, the Sweden Democrats had been operating in the background of their country’s politics for more than three decades. But they have only entered the mainstream since 2018, when they won 17.6% of the vote – up from around 13% in 2014. With a few high-profile expulsions of neo-Nazi members alongside a wider rebranding effort, the party appears to have successfully persuaded many voters of its acceptability.\n\nIt is not yet clear how the Sweden Democrats will work with the centre-right Moderates, Christian Democrats and Liberals who form the rest of the bloc. The Moderates may well lead a minority administration. Nonetheless, the size of the SD vote leaves them in a strong position to get concessions from the rest.\n\nThe result shouldn’t be too surprising, said Crouch. “We’ve seen anti-immigrant far-right parties getting significant votes in Scandinavian countries,” he said. However, the neo-Nazi origins of the Sweden Democrats have made this result even more shocking to outsiders. How has a country that once favoured internationalism and a more open border policy welcomed hostile anti-immigration rhetoric?\n\nThe political context\n\nThere has been an “ongoing political crisis” in Sweden, said Hinde. The Social Democrats have governed in coalition, and over the last parliamentary term, they and their partners have been unable to pass any significant policies.\n\nThe Sweden Democrats, alongside other rightwing parties, have capitalised on this stalemate to paint an image of the government as being a “leftwing coalition of chaos”, Hinde said. Over several years, the Sweden Democrats have successfully focused on anti-immigration and tough-on-crime policies. And that appears to have dragged mainstream parties to the right.\n\nIn a speech in July, the leader of the centre-right Moderates Party, Ulf Kristersson, congratulated the Sweden Democrats for their foresight in opposing large-scale immigration. The Social Democrat prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, said that she doesn’t want Sweden to have “Somalitowns” or other ethnic clusters in Swedish cities.\n\nLess than a decade ago, the Sweden Democrats were political pariahs, and overtly praising them – much less entering into a coalition with them – would have been unheard of. As recently as 2015, the former prime minister and then-leader of the Moderate party, Fredrik Reinfeldt, referred to the Sweden Democrats leaders as “racists” and “stiffly xenophobic”. But since their significant vote gains in the 2018 election, the centre-right has seen that cooperation with the Sweden Democrats can get them back into power.\n\nElection helpers count votes in Stockholm on 14 September 2022. Photograph: Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA country in decline?\n\nSo how did Sweden get here? While the country has long enjoyed an image as a prosperous society with a high standard of living, a strong social safety net, and a tradition of progressive values, many Swedish voters are frustrated and dissatisfied with the way the country is governed.\n\nTo those people, the perception of their country no longer matches the reality: “There’s there’s been a massive decline in the quality of public services, Swedish healthcare is a shadow of what it used to be, and the education system is really suffering,” Hinde said. All of this has fed a narrative that the Sweden Democrats have been pushing of a country in decline.\n\nThis sense of decline was heightened after the refugee crisis in 2015, when Sweden accepted a record high of more than 150,000 asylum seekers. That’s almost 1.5% of its overall population. As in other European countries, an initial welcome gave way to suspicion. In April, outgoing prime minister Andersson said she regretted that the government had allowed “parallel societies” to develop.\n\nA particularly intense sticking point has been this link between immigration and crime. Immigrants and refugees have been blamed for the increase in gun violence in the country’s suburbs by just about everyone. A high-profile shooting only a few weeks ago in a playground left a mother and child injured. Most of these shootings are related to gang activity, and while most of the victims are gang members, random people are sometimes caught in the crossfire. The Sweden Democrats have offered a simple cause of this unease and a solution: raise the drawbridge.\n\nThese kinds of solutions may not be as straightforward as they seem: Crouch spoke to an academic criminologist earlier in this week about the link between immigration and violent crime, “and he said the numbers are so small that it’s very hard to draw any firm conclusions”. But the narrative from both the centre-left Social Democrats and the central-right Moderate party has fundamentally been the same as the Sweden Democrats: immigration is a problem.\n\nThe international view\n\nWith the Sweden Democrats gaining such influence, this election has already affected Sweden’s international image. The Moderates are doing damage control, Hinde said, “staging a big press operation to reassure allies in the international press that they’re the sensible guys in charge”.\n\nSweden has a much larger cultural and political footprint than its size might be expected to dictate, and one of the reasons it’s maintained its place on the global stage is because of its progressive reputation.\n\nSo, even though the Sweden Democrats are in a three-seat majority government, and have no ministerial power, they have managed to potentially put Sweden on a wildly different trajectory. “Sweden always registers very highly in these country indexes about best national brands, it’s got very good diplomatic reputations and a good human rights record,” Hinde said. “And this is integral to Swedish politics and how Swedes see themselves.”\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

    "From Scotland to Sweden: How smart cities are helping residents save energy": "The university town of Umeå, in northern Sweden, is almost completely dark in winter. Encouraging residents to take public transport on cold, gloomy mornings requires some persuasion, but the city is more insightful than most about the needs of the people living there.\n\nAfter decades of applying a gendered lens to its travel surveys, the city knows that if everyone travelled like women, it would already have reached its sustainable transport goal for 2050.\n\nA bus stop was built with individual wooden pods to help women feel safer in public spaces.\n\n“It started a big discussion in Umeå,” project manager Carina Aschan says of the Station of Being, which uses distinct sounds and coloured lights to announce incoming electric buses.\n\nWhen a glassy note sounds, those sheltering in the Station of Being's rotating wooden pods know the bus to the glass factory is pulling in. RISE Sweden\n\n“It was meant to be an energy solution but it became a social solution too, and sparked a wider discussion about Umeå being innovative, and whether a city should do that.”\n\nDozens of smart solutions have been launched under an EU-funded project called RUGGEDISED, aiming to decarbonise three cities and inspire many more. As it draws to a close after six years, the question of what our cities can do for us, energy wise, has become more urgent than ever.\n\nHere are some of the brightest findings from the ‘lighthouse’ cities of Umeå, Rotterdam and Glasgow.\n\nWhat are smart cities?\n\nSmart cities sound futuristic but are built on some simple ideas around digitising our transport, buildings and other infrastructure. One way of thinking about smart solutions is working better with what’s already there.\n\nIn Rotterdam’s Heart of South experimentation area, the warmth from sewage water (which reaches up to 19C) will be recouped via a heat exchanger and stored in the thermal grid. Close by, tubes have been laid underneath the pavement to extract its heat (the concrete hits 65C in summer). In winter, warm water instead of cold will be pumped through them to melt the icy walkway.\n\nThe pavement heat/cold collector at the Ahoy centre. City of Rotterdam\n\nThere’s nothing flashy about this innovation, hidden below ground and around the back of the city’s Ahoy convention centre.\n\nBut it’s about results, and Ahoy has been fossil free since 2019. A carpet of thousands of solar panels on its roof supply the colossal energy needed for huge light shows, like Eurovision 2021.\n\nRewiring Rotterdam into a smart city\n\n“My dream is to have the built environment connected to sustainable energy sources,” Katelien van den Berge, Rotterdam’s RUGGEDISED project manager, tells Euronews Green.\n\nThe Netherlands’ second city was razed by German bombers during the second world war, so its eclectic architecture has relatively recent roots.\n\n“We do have an advantage because we have quite spacious public space,” explains van den Berge, making it easier to weave smarter infrastructure below roads and into the fabric of the city.\n\n“Rebuilding Rotterdam after World War Two, we had an empty inner city, it was all flattened and they built a district heating system” she says. “The ownership changed and the sources changed, but the system was already there, so that makes it easier to expand it.” Around 11 thousand homes are already connected.\n\nRotterdam's smart thermal grid being installed below ground. A new cinema in the Heart of South district will also be connected once it's built. City of Rotterdam\n\nHow smart solutions reduce energy demand\n\nKnowing more about the way energy flows through our cities also enables us to be more efficient in our use of it. Umeå’s most impactful solution has been better management of demand, says Aschan.\n\nAn intelligent set of sensors were installed in its university buildings, collecting data on human presence, temperature, light and CO2 levels. A smarter heating and cooling system followed which has achieved a 23 per cent drop in energy use during peak times across the campus.\n\nThe city’s university borders its hospital, and RUGGEDISED has sparked conversations between the two. Instead of building a new wing, the hospital realised it can use some of the empty university facilities at night. It may seem simple but using what is already there in a smarter way is what is needed in most cases.\n\nSmarter ways to use energy at home\n\nWheatley tenant Liz used to get up at night to run her washing machine, when electricity was cheaper. Now the new tech is saving her money and time. Peter Mohan\n\nThe main place that many city dwellers desperately need to save energy this winter is at home.\n\nThat’s not equally true across the continent. In Sweden, tenants have a right to a heated home and there’s no phrase for ‘fuel poverty’ (or warm banks). In the UK - despite Prime Minister Truss freezing bills at an average of €2,890 a year - 7 million households are still on course to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on fuel.\n\nTo alleviate the burden on some of its poorest residents, Glasgow City Council has partnered with Wheatley, Scotland’s biggest social housing group. Through RUGGEDISED, new devices have been installed on tenants’ electric storage heating systems, giving them greater control over the temperature in their flats.\n\nPeople are using around 20 per cent less electricity as a result, explains Wheatley carbon reduction and sustainability manager Colin Reid.\n\n“It allows us to interact with households, it offers them for the first time the ability to control heating in their own home when previously they were just the receivers,” he says.\n\n“It’s a courtesy for people that they can see for themselves how their home is operating.”\n\nGlasgow’s smart street\n\nGlasgow City Council is now looking at even bigger renewable energy projects, from covering capped landfill sites in solar panels to digging a borehole by the SEC. Getty Images/ TomasSereda\n\nIt’s often said that people make Glasgow and ‘people make Glasgow greener’ has become another call to action.\n\n“It’s part of the character of the city,” says Reid. “It’s got its issues and has a legacy of industrialisation, but on the whole Glasgow is a warm place. People want community with each other, so that’s a real asset whenever embarking on a just transition.”\n\nRunning through the heart of the city - along a stretch of George Street and Duke Street - is Glasgow’s flagship solution: it’s smart street.\n\nHere the council has trialled a range of measures, including lighting triggered when people walk past, a new solar canopy on the car park roof to charge EVs plus power storage, and district heating.\n\nWhen the world’s leaders descend on your city for COP, decision makers tend to take more notice, says Gavin Slater, head of sustainability at Glasgow City Council. Yet, “the city is a fundamentally better place” because of its participation in RUGGEDISED, he says.\n\nGlasgow has made great progress towards its net-zero by 2030 goal, Slater revealed. Carbon emissions have already been slashed by 50 per cent since 2006.\n\nDigital twins: How far can modelling data help cities get greener?\n\nIn Brno, the Czech Republic’s RUGGEDISED ‘follower’ city, residents can use the data platforms to see what savings they can make from installing solar panels on their roof. Euronews Green\n\nData is quickly transforming how we see our homes and streets, from an energy-saving point of view. Where there used to be one data point a year - someone coming to check your gas and electric - our homes are now a hive of numbers, notes Dr Marcel van Oosterhout from the Erasmus Centre for Data Analytics.\n\nPublic concern over how this data is used is, understandably, slowing its potential. The risk comes from how detailed a picture can fall into the wrong hands. Data about energy usage could be combined with addresses, giving a pretty clear indication of when people are on holiday.\n\nBut representatives from all three cities spoke in glowing terms about what ‘digital twins’ can do for sustainable planning. These are smart 3D models of the city that combine with real time data about how it’s functioning, explains Roland van der Heijden, programme manager for Digital City Rotterdam.\n\nThey enable residents to be brought into the planning process too. At the site of a new square, people can scan a QR code to create and judge designs, then use augmented reality to see how they will look.\n\nGeneric, scalable, maintainable data sources are key, adds van der Heijden. And it’s here that the private sector may have a big role to play. Google is drawing on huge data reserves to build up its environmental insights explorer (EIE) tool, totting up transport emissions, air quality and tree canopies.\n\nAnna Williams, a solutions lead in the tech giant’s Geo team, insists that “helping cities lower their emissions is our north star.”\n\nWhat are the limits on smartening cities?\n\nRotterdam's Ahoy rooftop. But residents with solar panels at home are currently unable to sell their energy to neighbours during peak times in the Netherlands.. Euronews Green\n\n“There’s no cookie cutter copy” to building smart cities, says Adriaan Slob, an expert at the Dutch research organisation TNO which has helped the cities with their sustainable transitions.\n\nA major challenge is that these smart solutions have to be implemented in existing urban areas, with their own messy webs.\n\nIn the Heart of South, Katelien van den Berge’s team could not get their smart electric grid off the ground. Though there are all the elements of smart lighting, electric vehicles and charging points, the city didn’t get the experimental status it needed to connect them, and a key contract bid for by energy partner Eneco was granted elsewhere.\n\n“There was no coordination between tendering on a city scale and implementing on a project level,” reflects van den Berge. And with no overall owner, there was noone to take responsibility for the grid’s success. No matter in a city as restless as Rotterdam; the team are taking their learnings to a number of other big urban development areas.\n\nWhere ambition has overreached itself, RUGGEDISED still provides some striking blueprints. But it’s clear that smarter connectivity is needed at a higher, legislative level too.\n\nAs for the energy crisis overarching citizen’s lives - in Glasgow and Rotterdam at least - van den Berge believes “there can only be a way up. I think this winter will be the bottom, and then we will start working on how we are going to tackle it.”",

    "Sweden mulls the cost to save communities from rising sea": "The low-lying farmland around the Swedish village of Skanör is highly vulnerable to rising sea levels | Charlie Duxbury for POLITICO\n\nPress play to listen to this article Voiced by Amazon Polly\n\nSKANÖR, Sweden — On January 4, 2017, a day of clear skies and light winds on Sweden’s far southwestern Falsterbonäset peninsula, the flood warning went out.\n\nRescue services scrambled to help motorists trapped on local roads after unusual winds offshore sent sea water surging toward the villages of Skanör, Ljunghusen and Höllviken.\n\nOne isolated cottage was partially submerged.\n\nBy around 8 p.m., the water was already receding, and while the villagers could breathe a sigh of relief, officials in the municipal offices the in nearby town of Vellinge were realizing that a bullet had just been dodged.\n\n“If there had been a strong onshore wind that day, it could have been a catastrophe,” said Carina Wutzler, mayor of Vellinge Municipality. “We would have seen a lot more damage.”\n\nThe pressing question for lawmakers in such areas across Europe and beyond is what should be saved and how, and at what cost to public budgets and the natural environment, from catastrophic events that are due to become more frequent as the global climate heats up.\n\n“I still get people saying that flooding is not going to happen, and I say to them it is already happening,” Wutzler said. “We need protection now, this is not something for 50 years’ time.”\n\nThe Falsterbonäset peninsula, which is covered by the Vellinge administration, is an affluent mix of high-end summer homes and commuter belt luxury living. It is one of 18 coastal spots on a Swedish government list of areas at risk of flooding as the climate warms, polar ice melts, sea levels rise and storms intensify.\n\nArguably the most vulnerable place on that list, the peninsula is a prime example of the type of low-lying European coastline, inhabited in many cases for centuries, which now suddenly faces an uncertain future.\n\nClimatologists and oceanographers are warning local lawmakers in exposed villages from Fairbourne in Wales to Germany's Halligen islands that new and potentially expensive challenges lie ahead as coastal flooding becomes more common and more damaging. Around half of the peninsula’s 8,800 homes stand on land less than 3 meters above sea level.\n\nEven under the very lowest scenarios for global greenhouse gas emissions between now and 2100, scientists expect sea level to rise between 28 and 55 centimeters. Under the highest emissions scenario, seas could rise by more than a meter. And projections from the European Environment Agency suggest that flooding events that currently come once a century to Skanör will occur six times more frequently by the end of the century.\n\nHard choices\n\nEuropean lawmakers aiming to hold back the sea generally look to the Netherlands, long the Continent’s gold standard in flood management.\n\nWith much of its territory below sea level, the country has already deployed a 3,700km string of flood defenses ranging from natural features like sand dunes to imposing feats of engineering like storm surge barriers.\n\nExperts say that as sea levels rise, a wider range of European leaders must now address similar challenges. But first, there's a more fundamental question: Should anything be done at all?\n\nIn Falsterbonäset, environmentalists had long pushed for little or no response to the rising flood threat, arguing that the area’s coastal meadows and beaches, home to many plants and animals, depended on their interaction with the sea for their existence.\n\nThe council for the county of Skåne, which includes Vellinge municipality, was also among those pushing back against building barriers through sensitive coastal ecosystems.\n\nSand dunes protecting the Swedish village of Skanör from the sea are expected to be breached more regularly over coming years | Charlie Duxbury for POLITICO\n\n“One of the big challenges, as the county council sees it, is finding space [for the barrier] without unacceptable intrusions into protected areas,” Maria Nitare, a water management official with the county council, said during a visit to Falsterbonäset.\n\nBut in 2014, Vellinge municipality decided to take a stand and began consultations for a plan to build a 20km long barrier of embankments, walls and dunes round the built-up parts of Falsterbonäset. The planned barrier was to be 3 meters high, relative to sea level.\n\nThe application was submitted in 2018 after discussions with a wide range of interested parties from local residents and business owners to oceanographers and climatologists.\n\nThe proposal was initially approved by planning authorities, but then, in a sign of what could be waiting for other Swedish municipalities facing the threat of flooding, the process stalled. There were objections from some that the barriers went too far and from others that they didn’t go far enough.\n\nOne particularly vocal group were local golf course owners, who have found to their consternation that they won’t be protected by the municipality's barriers.\n\nFalsterbonäset is home to several golf courses and is something of a national center for the sport. Visited on a recent weekday, the course in Ljunghusen was hosting a tournament for pairs of brothers to play against each other.\n\nClub manager Magnus Jivén described how in 2017, he watched in dismay as the sea crept closer to the front door of the clubhouse. To his relief, the building wasn’t flooded.\n\n“If you look at the Netherlands, they would build barriers out in the sea, but here the golf courses and the beaches aren’t being protected,” he said. “These places are some of the main reasons why people live here, so why not protect them as well as the houses.”\n\nOther objections have come from local residents who say the proposed embankments and walls will block their view of the sea as well as impinging on their privacy as people walking on the new embankments will be able to see into nearby gardens and houses.\n\n“The barrier is going to be right outside my fence,” Yvonne Lendrup, a Ljunghusen resident who has objected to the municipality plan, told national broadcaster SVT recently. “We’d really like to avoid this happening.”\n\nLjunghusen is seen as one of the most desirable places to live in Sweden. One house there recently sold for more than €5 million and on a recent weekday, two red Ferrari sports cars navigated the area’s narrow roads in quick succession.\n\nIn the early days of its flood barrier project in 2015, Vellinge Municipality estimated combined property values in Falsterbonästet at more than €5 billion and officials said prices have risen sharply since then.\n\nThe municipal council judged that if it did not provide a credible plan to protect the area over the coming decades, then residents and businesses could be expected to pull out as insurance premiums rocket and the risk of inundation intesifies.\n\nThe cost of the new flood defenses is expected to be around €19 million. Vellinge has applied to the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency for funding as well as to the EU via its Life program, but has said it will cover any shortfall through its own budget.\n\nTest case\n\nFor the other 17 Swedish sites judged by the government as at risk of flooding — including parts of the capital Stockholm and second city Gothenburg, as well as smaller towns like Kristianstad — Vellinge is proving an interesting test case serving to highlight gaps in the national response to the threat of climate change.\n\nAs Vellinge worked to develop its plans for flood barriers, mayor Wutzler said she had seen “surprisingly little interest” from ministers and other parliamentarians in the capital Stockholm and called on them to engage more closely with coastal communities facing existential threats from higher seas.\n\nA first report from a government-appointed expert group said Sweden’s response to climate change must be integrated more closely with other elements of the nation’s civil defense.\n\n“We must shift the focus from problems to solutions and from planning to implementation,” the report published in February said. “The efforts that have been made so far have not been able to create the necessary changes in society.”\n\nEnvironmentalists worry that building flood barriers through coastal meadows around Sweden's Falsterbonäset peninsula will damage important habitats | Charlie Duxbury for POLITICO\n\nIn June this year, the Swedish court of appeal responsible for environmental and land management ruled that construction of the barriers around Falsterbonäset could begin.\n\nWutzler said it was a relief and that construction of the first section of the barriers north of Skanör would begin within a year.\n\n“We are developing a solution so that we have an answer when we look ahead. Because when we look ahead, we see that the threat from flooding is only going to get worse,” she said.\n\nKarl Mathiesen contributed reporting.\n\nThis article is part of the Climate, Changed series.",
    "‘People don’t want to hear about it’: how the pandemic shaped Sweden’s politics": "In the Stockholm neighbourhood of Tensta, the pandemic has left many feeling hopeless and disenfranchised, says Fatuma Mohamed.\n\nWhile much of Sweden – including politicians – appear to have forgotten all about Covid, the health communicator and longtime resident said that many in the area are still grappling with its impact.\n\nAlthough people had been advised by authorities to work from home, many in Tensta, with its high refugee population, had no choice but to go out because of the nature of their jobs.\n\n“They didn’t have any possibility to stay at home,” said Mohamed, sitting outside Tensta Konsthall, a contemporary arts centre, where people were arriving for a coffee meet-up.\n\nTwo and a half years after the introduction of the “Swedish strategy”– the Scandinavian country’s divergent pandemic response, which kept schools open and eschewed lockdowns – the results are mixed.\n\nMental health and children’s learning appear to have been less affected than they might have been, although 2.57m infections were recorded in the population of just over 10 million and in excess of 19,900 died, with stark inequality exposed in the process.\n\nIn comparison, Norway, with a little over half Sweden’s population, has had 1.46m cases and nearly 4,000 deaths; while Finland, also with just over half Sweden’s population, has had 1.27m cases and nearly 5,700 deaths.\n\nFatuma Mohamed in Tensta, Stockholm. Photograph: Miranda Bryant/The Observer\n\nAn independent commission into the handling of the pandemic, the findings of which were published earlier this year, found that while the choice of path for disease prevention and control was “fundamentally correct”, the measures “were too few and should have come sooner”. The government, it said, should have taken control of all aspects of crisis management from the start and had relied too heavily on its public health agency, Folkhälsomyndigheten.\n\nAnd yet, as Sweden prepares to go to the polls on 11 September, in the first election since these life or death decisions were made, it is almost as if Covid never happened. Left- and right-leaning party leaders, who are in a tight race, are focusing on crime, immigration and energy prices but not Covid.\n\nFor many, this has highlighted the gulf between the living conditions of Sweden’s different communities. In Tensta, some groups of up to 10 people live in two-room flats, said Mohamed, 43, who has three daughters,\n\n“But the ‘Swedish’,” she said, miming inverted commas with her hands, “they live, maybe two or three people in eight, seven or four rooms, maybe. So they had the opportunity to have social distance.\n\n“It is not just a health problem,” she added. “This is a political problem.” Services such as banks, dentists and job centres had vanished from the area, she claimed, and many people were unemployed, splitting society into “parallel communities”.\n\n“It’s not good to have different lives in the same country. We are all the same people, we are all Swedish citizens, so we should have the same opportunity.”\n\nExperiences of the pandemic have deepened distrust of government and social services, she said. Mohamed isn’t sure how this will affect people’s votes in the election, but the rightwing anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats have become the second biggest party in the polls after Magdalena Andersson’s incumbent Social Democrats. The left, centre and green parties are saying the right things, Mohamed said, but she will be watching to see whether their words are turned into action.\n\nJimmie Åkesson (third from right), Sweden Democrats leader, visiting Linköping in April after riots sparked by a far-right threat to burn the Qur’an. Photograph: Jeppe Gustafsson/Shutterstock\n\n“I don’t think the people who live in this area have any trust for any party because we don’t have a good life,” she said. “Definitely, they don’t like to vote Sweden Democrats but, for the other parties, interest is not high because they think it’s the same: ‘If I vote or not vote, the result will be the same.’ Most don’t have jobs, we live cramped, we don’t have the same opportunities.”\n\nAnother Tensta resident, Liban Warsame, whose 19-year-old son was murdered in December 2020, said most people in the area felt left out of Swedish society, and that the pandemic had had a huge impact on the community. “Many older people from Somalia died because of the pandemic. In the election, we’re going to vote and we’re going to take our responsibility,” he said.\n\nHealth experts say they are disappointed by the lack of attention the pandemic is receiving and fear that lessons will not be learned from the vulnerabilities it exposed in Swedish society, especially its impact on immigrants and the elderly. Göran Stiernstedt, a member of Sweden’s coronavirus commission and associate professor of infectious disease at Stockholm’s Karolinska Institute, said: “It really exposed that the risk for people born outside Europe was much greater than those born in Sweden.” The impact on the elderly was also severe, he added, including lack of medical care in nursing homes and staff left alone with no doctors.\n\nSign up to This is Europe Free weekly newsletter The most pivotal stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Nothing had been done to fix the issue, he felt, despite investigations. “You could expect that this would have been a great thing now in the election, but you don’t hear a single word about that.”\n\nThe fact that the Corona Commission’s report was published the day after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine did not help it gain momentum, but Stiernstedt believes there is also a psychological explanation for the silence on Covid’s impact. “People don’t want to hear about it. They want to live their normal life. And when you walk today, it’s like 2019, actually, and that’s natural. I think it’s related to human nature.”\n\nWhile Emma Frans, a researcher and epidemiologist at Karolinska Institute, is surprised by the silence around Covid in the election, she\n\nsaid: “People have had thoughts about how do we look at our elderly. And also maybe understanding how this type of health crisis affects people differently depending on who they are, their position in society and what means they have.”\n\nThe pandemic had also highlighted “outdated” perceptions of what a “traditional Swedish home” looked like, she said. “And there were problems with not getting information out to people who are not speaking or reading in Swedish.”\n\nThrough the public health agency, which was responsible for responding to the pandemic, politicians had had a “free pass” when it came to Covid deaths, said Frans. The government “hid” behind Anders Tegnell, Sweden’s former state epidemiologist, she added.\n\nAmineh Kakabaveh, an influential independent MP. Photograph: Getty\n\nAt the Stockholm HQ of Folkhälsomyndigheten, Karin Tegmark Wisell, who became its head last November, stands by most of the major decisions made during the pandemic – including keeping schools open and not making face masks mandatory. But, she said, Covid had highlighted ongoing health inequalities, especially among immigrants, more of whom ended up in intensive care.\n\nThese problems, she said, could not be solved by a public health agency alone and needed government intervention; she said she would like to see the matter addressed more in the election. “From my perspective, that is the most important issue,” she said.\n\nAmineh Kakabaveh, an independent politician who has played a pivotal role in the power balance of the current government, said parties weren’t criticising the pandemic response because they were part of the decision-making process. “Each of them had opportunity to say something, to do something – that is why it is passed, even if it is not over. But on class, society and employment, a lot of people still don’t feel good psychologically.”",
    "Swedish election: far right makes gains but overall result on knife-edge": "The far-right Sweden Democrats party was the big winner in the country’s election on Sunday, increasing its share of the vote by two to three percentage points and becoming the second largest party, but the overall result was too close to call as counting continued.\n\nWith 95% of votes counted, the rightwing bloc had 49.7% of the vote, which would give it a majority of one seat in parliament over the incumbent leftwing bloc.\n\nExit polls on Sunday night at first suggested a narrow victory for the Social Democrats and their centre-left allies. But as the votes were counted the tally swung towards the right.\n\nA conclusive result may not be known until votes from Swedes living abroad are counted in the middle of the week, while the closeness of the race may yet complicate the formation of a working government.\n\nThe leader of the Sweden Democrats said early on Monday that the rightwing bloc was likely heading for victory. “Right now it looks like there will be a change of power,” Jimmie Åkesson said in a speech to party members.\n\nThe incumbent Social Democrat prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, told cheering supporters on Sunday night: “We’re not going to have a final result tonight”, Andersson, 55, called on Swedes to “have patience” and “let democracy run its course”.\n\nThe prospect that the far-right Sweden Democrats, who appeared to take more than 20% of the poll, may for the first time achieve direct influence over government policy marks a seismic shift in a country far better known for its liberal traditions.\n\nThe SD emerged from Sweden’s neo-Nazi movement in the mid-1990s and still struggles to shake off accusations of extremism. It was treated as a pariah by other parties, but three years ago, the centre-right Moderate party embraced cooperation with the far right.\n\nThe SD has increased its vote at each of the past nine general elections. Its leaders are demanding ministerial office, but the other three parties in the bloc have said they will not invite the party into government itself. However, the SD’s position as the largest party on the right places them in a strong position.\n\n“The SD is currently by far the biggest party in the world with Nazi roots,” said Tobias Hübinette, lecturer in intercultural studies at Karlstad University and a leading anti-racist.\n\n“Even if the party officially condemns its own race ideological roots, this background is today still present in the sense that the SD is still … seeing itself as the only political force that can save the native white Swedish majority population.”\n\nÅkesson told a crowd of cheering supporters on Sunday evening: “Our goal is to sit in government. Our goal is a majority government. It’s looking pretty damn good now.”\n\nThe party secretary, Richard Jomshof, told public television SVT he “didn’t believe” other parties would be able to freeze out the Sweden Democrats again and expected to have a strong influence on the country’s politics. “We are so big now … it is clear we should have a spot on parliamentary committees,” he said.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Next stop, Kabul,” tweeted the party’s legal spokesperson, highlighting the SD’s demand to remove non-European immigrants.\n\nThe election has revealed Sweden to be a nation deeply ill at ease with immigration, with the SD able to exploit fears over violent crime. Voter concerns such as energy price rises, failing schools and long queues for healthcare were drowned out by a relentless focus on immigration and crime.\n\nThe campaign was punctuated by further incidents of gang violence, the prevalence of which during the past five years – and the failure of government and the police to prevent them – has helped the SD to cement support for its central message that immigration is to blame.\n\nTwo weeks ago, a woman and her five-year-old child were injured after being caught in crossfire in Eskilstuna, west of Stockholm. In Malmö a week earlier, a 15-year-old boy shot dead a gang leader in a shopping mall. The number of fatal shootings rose sharply to 34 in the first six months of this year, up from 20 in the same period of 2021.\n\nParty leaders on both left and right linked the rise in violent crime with large-scale immigration, which has led to high levels of segregation along ethnic lines in the housing and jobs markets. In the space of a few decades, Sweden has become one of the most multicultural societies in Europe, with more than a third of the population having been born abroad or having a parent who was born abroad. About 30% of children do not have Swedish as their mother tongue, rising to 45% in parts of the cities.",

    "Sweden announces emergency guarantees for energy companies": "PM says Sweden is facing the prospect of a ‘war winter’ due to an energy crunch amid the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nSweden has said it would provide several hundred billion dollars in liquidity guarantees to Nordic and Baltic energy companies to avert a financial crisis sparked by Russia’s Gazprom shutting the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline.\n\nPrime Minister Magdalena Andersson warned that Sweden was facing the prospect of a “war winter” because of Europe’s energy crunch, and said the exact details of the guarantees remained to be worked out.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Saturday, Andersson said the guarantees were aimed at giving energy groups “the breathing room that is needed”.\n\nShe said there was “a clear security policy agenda behind Russia’s actions”.\n\nMoscow has blamed sanctions imposed by the West following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine for impeding routine maintenance on the pipeline, but some European Union officials have accused Russia of using energy as a weapon.\n\n“Russia’s energy war is having serious consequences for Europe and Swedish households and companies, especially in southern Sweden which is dependent on electricity prices in Germany, which in turn is very dependent on gas,” she said.\n\n“This threatens our financial stability. If we don’t act soon it could lead to serious disruptions in the Nordics and Baltics,” she said.\n\n“In the worst-case scenario, we could fall into a financial crisis.”\n\nThe announcement came after Russia said on Friday it was cutting off the Nord Stream gas pipeline to Germany indefinitely due to what it said were leaks in a turbine – deepening Europe’s difficulties in securing winter fuel.\n\nThe closure is expected to lead to even higher production prices for electricity companies when the market opens on Monday.\n\nSpeaking at the same news conference, Finance Minister Mikael Damberg said the government will put forward a proposal that allows it to issue credit guarantees, adding that all of the country’s parliamentary parties and the speaker had been informed.\n\nDamberg also said the Swedish decision would “secure financial stability not only in Sweden, but in the entire Nordic region”.\n\nThe guarantees were expected to be in place on Monday before the stock market closing and would cover all Nordic and Baltic actors within the next two weeks.\n\nSweden’s parliament has been called in from its summer break to hold a vote on the government’s proposal on Monday.\n\nSweden is experiencing its highest inflation in 30 years, and the central bank has raised rates twice this year, with more steep hikes expected before yearend.\n\nSoaring electricity bills, rising interest rates and stalling economic growth have dominated campaigning ahead of the general election on September 11.\n\nOn Wednesday, Damberg said the government expected to have $8.36bn available to help ease consumers’ pain of record electricity prices this year and next.",

    "I don’t recognize Sweden anymore": "Jim Stenman is a Swedish-Ethiopian journalist. He has worked as a producer for CNN International in Europe and the Gulf, and reported for Reuters and the BBC World Service.\n\nAs Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson arrived in my childhood hometown of Eskilstuna recently, even she must have realized that Sweden was losing its war on gang violence.\n\nOnly a day earlier, the city had finally earned its title of “Little Chicago” — a term casually used during my teenage years, especially when describing rougher parts of town.\n\nThough I never took the analogy seriously, that day, one of those areas became the scene of sheer horror, when a woman and a young child were shot at a playground. Police have since linked the incident to gang crime, and thankfully, it didn’t result in any fatalities — both survived.\n\nWhile addressing the shooting, Sweden’s first female leader, who has been in office for less than a year, warned that criminal gangs now pose a threat for “anyone who happens to come in their way, even normal law-abiding citizens.” And she made a direct correlation between violence and a rise in the drug trade, which she vowed to have a national conversation about, and to crack down on crime by abandoning Sweden’s soft penal code.\n\nFor Andersson, talking tough on crime may be a necessity rather than a choice. Her center-left coalition government risks being voted out of office in the country’s general election tomorrow, as the vote takes place against a backdrop of a rising inflation and mounting fears over Russian aggression in the Baltic Sea.\n\nMany Swedes, as I do, feel the country’s heading in the wrong direction.\n\nA few months ago, three young men in neighboring Örebro were shot dead over the span of eight days, part of a wave of gang violence spreading across Sweden. And while I never expected the country to turn into a gangster’s paradise, it’s always been obvious to me that our approach to integration has been a ticking time bomb.\n\nBorn in the early 1980s, I witnessed firsthand just how difficult it can be to become part of mainstream Swedish society. My mother, an Ethiopian refugee, certainly ticked all the “right” boxes, such as marrying a local and accepting whatever jobs came her way.\n\nStill, she was never fully accepted as Swedish, despite having a near perfect command of the language and being clearly embedded within the culture.\n\nIt seemed to me that people like her faced an element of otherness that was difficult, if not impossible, to overcome. Moreover, many of my friends, some of whom were born to parents from the Middle East, chose not to identity as Swedish, despite being raised in the country.\n\nSweden, which had a largely homogenous population in the past, has faced serious challenges in welcoming non-European immigrants into its society. And I believe this may partly explain the difficult situation facing the country today.\n\nSweden experienced labor-based immigration in the late 1960s. And government data shows significant migrant arrivals from Iran in the late 1980s and Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. Immigration numbers then reached an all-time high in 2016, as the country, alongside Germany, opted for a largely open-border policy when it came to Syrian refugees.\n\nAs of 2021, Sweden had over 196,000 Syrian-born residents — a significant number for a country with a population of about 10 million. The total number of foreign-born people has rapidly increased over the last two decades, now amounting to 20 percent of the overall population. And though Syrians make up the largest group of immigrants, those born in Iraq and Finland also contribute to Sweden’s foreign-born population.\n\nPersonally, I don’t buy into the extreme belief held by some Swedes that immigrants largely come to our country to exploit its generous welfare system. But according to the European Commission, as things stand, the unemployment rate among foreign-born residents is more than four times that of native Swedes. It only stands to reason this breeds exclusion.\n\nAnd it’s perhaps not surprising that 2022 is on track to become the worst year on record for violence, with nearly 50 deadly shootings so far — a reality that’s proving a major headache for Andersson’s center-left coalition government, which has been in power since 2014. And her own Social Democratic party has overseen years, if not decades, of failed integration policy under previous prime ministers.\n\nOffering sanctuary to those fleeing war is always the right thing to do, but Sweden’s experiment with multiculturalism seems to have taken a turn for the worse since 2016.\n\nI’m not suggesting Syrians, or any other migrant group, should be held responsible for the rise in gang crime. It’s particularly worth highlighting that the Swedish integration model was failing long before their arrival, even causing some naturalized Swedes, including others with Middle Eastern roots, to support the far right in bid to limit further immigration.\n\nBut now, the country’s second largest party, the Sweden Democrats, is on a mission to restore what they perceive to be “traditional Swedish values.” Historically locked out of power due to other parties’ unwillingness to partner with them, they are projected to secure about 20 percent of the votes tomorrow, and they may be on track to play a key role in a possible center-right coalition that could end up ruling the country for the next four years.\n\nThis would mark their first time in government, and it would certainly prove a game-changer for the country. The party’s priorities include ending segregated neighborhoods, curbing organized crime and limiting immigration.\n\nThough I may morally disagree with closing our borders to those in need, perhaps it’s the best way to recalibrate — at least temporarily — after decades of failed policies.\n\nWhile it’s impossible to turn back the clock on immigration, Sweden must find a way to solve its integration problem before it’s too late. And the only way to achieve this is by recognizing present-day Sweden for what it really is — a multicultural society.\n\nWhile the far right is effectively pitching to make “Sweden Great Again,” I’m convinced we need to forge a more inclusive national identity that recognizes the demographic changes of recent decades, while also embracing the unique dual heritages now present throughout our country.\n\nIt is only by recognizing who we are that it’s possible to create a society that doesn’t breed exclusion or worse, crime.",
    "Dagen H: the day Sweden switched to driving on the right – archive, 1967": "Halting way to the right road\n\n4 September 1967\n\nStockholm\n\nCheering crowds brought traffic to a halt here today as Sweden changed to driving on the right after four years of preparations, 40 years of argument, and at a total cost estimated at double the official figure of £40m.\n\nAll traffic had to halt for 10 minutes at 4.50 this morning throughout Sweden’s 60,000 miles of roads, but in Kungsgatan, Stockholm’s Oxford Street, the wait for impatient Swedish drivers wanting to try their luck on the right was much longer.\n\nBarred\n\nThough the centre of the city had been barred for nearly 24 hours to all but taxis, buses, and cars with special permits, a solid jam developed as sightseers, cyclists, and television cameramen swamped the roadway.\n\nThe police watched dourly as long lines of traffic – headlamps glaring, horns blowing –tried vainly to switch sides in the approved manner, getting hopelessly entangled in the process.\n\nWith military helicopters buzzing overhead, order was eventually restored and “Höger-dag”, “Right Day”, as the Swedes reverently term it, returned to the clockwork efficiency which marked its planning. Some 2,000 soldiers, 6,000 civil police, 50,000 school police, and 150,000 volunteers were on duty throughout Sweden, while an army of construction workers had worked throughout the night to make the final alterations to 350,000 street signs.\n\nLast detail\n\nThough there was the occasional jam and a number of minor accidents, the Swedish reputation for thoroughness can hardly ever have been better displayed. Typical of the meticulous attention to detail was that even the elk-hunting season had been brought forward a week so that hunters would not add to the traffic problem.\n\nTo prevent accidents from absent-mindedness after the change, and intensive publicity campaign has been mounted by the government in addition to the imposition of strict speed limits. These range from 40kph (25mph) in built-up areas to 90kph (58mph) on motorways. Drivers have been advised to keep their headlights switched on night and day until tomorrow.\n\nThe testing time, police say, is likely to be in about three weeks when drivers begin to relax and forget. The attitude here to the change seems curiously ambivalent. Many drivers say they are thankful it is at last over, yet are critical of the cost of the operation.\n\nThe criticism is no doubt the sharper because of the proposed 50 percent increase in vehicle tax next year, which is widely held to be the result of “Höger-dag.” And only just over 10 years ago in a national referendum, 83 percent voted against the change. When the Bill was finally passed in the Riksdag in 1963 after a deal between the two major political parties, it was estimated that the cost would be Kr400m (£28m) to be raised by a special vehicle tax of £2 13s for small cars and £5 for large cars, buses, and lorries.\n\nCost of £80m\n\nIn 1965 the official estimate was revived to Kr600m (£42m) and is now believed that the final cost to the government is likely to exceed Kr800m (£60m) with indirect cost of at least Kr200m, making a total of £80m.\n\nSign up to This is Europe Free weekly newsletter The most pivotal stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Iceland now plans to change next year.\n\nThough the British Road Federation, the Ministry of Transport, the AA and the RAC, all had observers in Stockholm, there is as yet no enthusiasm from anyone for a similar move in Britain.\n\nThe cost would be astronomical – £350m was the last estimate – but even more important, the reasons which led Sweden to conform with her neighbours are not applicable. Ninety per-cent of our cars are not left-hand drive and the number of foreign and British cars entering and leaving is still comparatively small.\n\nUntil the Channel tunnel is built and until we get into the Common Market, the idea of a change is almost certainly a non-starter. Even then our insularity in every sense could well delay the move for at least a generation. But by the year 2000 even the Swedes think we will have followed suit.",

    "Right-wing nationalism comes to ... Sweden?": "As we look ahead to midterm elections, where election deniers are on the ballot in 27 states, it’s still mind-blowing to consider how we got here in just a few years. And the answer, most bluntly, is a rise in right-wing nationalism.\n\nAfter lying dormant for some time, the contours of this new and arguably ascendant movement are by now well-known. There are many characteristics, most of which are deeply troubling if you’re a fan of democracy, including but not limited to:\n\nA preference for national, religious and ethnic purity; an antipathy for migrants and immigrants; an open hostility to the press and a desire to punish critics; and an apologist or even approving approach to authoritarianism.\n\nWhile all of that easily describes the right-wing nationalism stoked and nurtured by Donald Trump here in America, it also describes a stunning surge of authoritarianism in other countries, most notably Brazil and Hungary, where leaders Jair Bolsonaro and Viktor Orban, respectively, have puppeted Trump’s strong-arm nationalism to considerable success.\n\nColumnists bug Columnists In-depth political coverage, sports analysis, entertainment reviews and cultural commentary.\n\n\n\nElsewhere, from Boris Johnson and now Liz Truss in the United Kingdom to Marine Le Pen in France, right-wing nationalism is getting a bigger audience, not a smaller one.\n\nThis is disturbing enough. Whether in Latin America or Europe, an embrace of nationalism, and in some cases fascism, recalls some truly horrific moments in world history.\n\nBut what if I told you right-wing nationalism was also winning in some less expected places — say, Sweden?\n\nYes, the same Sweden that American liberals and progressives have long called an egalitarian utopia.\n\nThe same Sweden that consistently ranks among the happiest, the freest, the most liberal, friendliest to immigrants, freest for journalists, the least racist and safest for LGBTQ travel countries in the world.\n\nLast week, this same Sweden held general elections to elect the 349 members of the Riksdag, or legislature. The right-wing Sweden Democrats won a net gain of 11 new seats, for a total of 73, surpassing the moderates to make it the second-most popular party in the country behind the left-wing Social Democrats.\n\nThis was shocking for many Swedes and election watchers, according to Elisabeth Asbrink, author of “Made in Sweden: 25 Ideas That Created a Country.” The success of the Sweden Democrats, she writes in The New York Times this week, “marks the end of Swedish exceptionalism, the idea that the country stood out both morally and materially.”\n\nOpinion Newsletter\n\nAs she describes it, the party’s origins date back to 1988 and a neo-Nazi group called BSS, or Keep Sweden Swedish. The far-right movement has “profited from the country’s growing inequalities, fostering an obsession with crime and an antipathy to migrants.”\n\nShe notes how the party’s chief of staff in the Swedish Parliament declared that critical journalists should be “punished” and were to be considered “enemies of the nation.”\n\nThe country’s defense minister called the party a security risk, due to its neo-Nazi ties.\n\nEarlier this year, the party’s leader, Jimmie Akesson, refused to choose between President Joe Biden and Russian dictator Vladimir Putin.\n\nThis all sounds very familiar to us: It echoes the climate we’ve been living in here in the U.S. for the past six years during the rise of Trump.\n\nIt was once easy to think of this new political populist era as a uniquely American response to uniquely American problems. Trump was, after all, a uniquely American invention, and he was both benefiting from and leaning into uniquely American divisions and grievances.\n\nBut clearly we aren’t as special as we thought. A rise in populism in India and Pakistan, as well as Poland, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, France and now even Sweden is proving the movement is global, and so is its appeal.\n\nTo call it merely nostalgia is to divorce it from the racial, ethnic and sexual anxieties that inform right-wing nationalism and make up many of its punitive policies. But a desire to return to some long-gone way of life is a common thread across international borders.\n\n“Back to red cottages and apple trees, to law and order, to women being women and men being men,” as Asbrink describes it in Sweden.\n\nThe reaction to this voting block sounds familiar, too: “Individuals leaning toward the Sweden Democrats … have felt stigmatized … This has not only fed the party’s self-image as a martyr but also nurtured even more loyalty among its supporters,” Asbrink writes.\n\nPerhaps it’s some consolation to know the U.S. isn’t the only democracy in jeopardy — that we aren’t uniquely susceptible to these dark impulses, that this isn’t one of those “only in America” problems.\n\nBut that doesn’t change the fact that none of this is good. The rise in right-wing nationalism is corrosive and chilling, and the more it spreads, the worse it is for the world.\n\nS.E. Cupp is the host of “S.E.

    "Study of 9 million Swedes shows rapidly declining effectiveness of COVID vaccines against Omicron": "The findings of a new Swedish study posted to the Preprints with The Lancet* server found that two COVID-19 vaccine doses provided effective long-term protection against infection before Omicron, but less protection against Omicron infection (dropping to 43% by week four and no protection by week 14). Furthermore, two COVID-19 vaccine doses provided substantial long-term protection against severe disease, according to follow-ups until 13 months after vaccination. The vaccine's effectiveness against hospitalization was high and stable prior to Omicron, but it also declined after Omicron.\n\nStudy: Effectiveness of COVID-19 Vaccines Over 13 Months Covering the Period of the Emergence of the Omicron Variant in the Swedish Population. Image Credit: Orpheus FX / Shutterstock\n\nBackground\n\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), affected millions of individuals globally and warranted rapid vaccine development and deployment after its outbreak. Hence, adequate clinical trials could not be conducted to determine the vaccine effectiveness (VE) against the rapidly evolving variants of SARS-CoV-2 and the newly developed and approved vaccines.\n\nThe study\n\nThis study aimed to estimate the time-dependent vaccine effectiveness (VE) against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the rate of hospitalization, admission to the intensive care units (ICUs), and fatality over 13 months after two doses of COVID-19 vaccination.\n\nThe study compared the time-dependent pattern of VE pre- and post-emergence of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, differences in the VE were noted based on gender, age, and vaccine type.\n\nThe study was conducted between December 2020 and January 2022 in Sweden among populations eligible for COVID-19 vaccination. In this country, vaccination of the elderly started on 27 December 2020; the younger population was vaccinated in 2021 and 2022, during which the campaign reached a larger part of the population. The cohort comprised individuals above 12 years of age. The Swedish register data were used for estimating COVID-19 VE with lapsing time and before and after the Omicron emergence – in reducing the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease outcomes.\n\nResults\n\nIn the cohort of 9,153,456 individuals, 85% were vaccinated with a single dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, 82% with two doses of vaccine, 45% with at least three doses of vaccine, and 15% were unvaccinated. The most vaccinated individuals (86%) were 65 or older. Most people received either mRNA-1273 (Moderna) or BNT162b2 BioNTech, Pfizer ) vaccine. A small percentage (8%) of the study population were vaccinated twice with the AZD1222 (Oxford, AstraZeneca) vaccine.\n\nOn average, the time gap between the first two doses was seven weeks (ten weeks for AZD1222), and between the second and third doses was 28 weeks (25 weeks for AZD1222).\n\nDuring the study period, 22% of the study population were infected with SARS-CoV-2 for the first time. There were 0.9% hospitalizations, while 0.1% required ICU admission. The fatality rate was 0.2%. The VE post second dose peaked after the third week, rapidly dropping between weeks 14-17. However, the VE seemed negligible from week 18.\n\nVE among hospitalized individuals peaked at 90% in the fifth and sixth week while maintaining up to 82% from week one to 25. Meanwhile, VE after the second dose was higher and lasted longer.\n\nAfter the first dose, the acquired immunity against COVID-19 was comparatively lower, the peak VE against COVID-19 infection was less than 50%, and the vaccine became ineffective from week 30. A transient decline in VE was documented after the first vaccination at week two, relative to week one, which peaked in the following weeks. However, the VE remained below 80%.\n\nThe Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 caused the speediest fall in VE. This led to a major disparity between the pre-and post-Omicron VEs. The VE mostly remained above 85% before Omicron emergence; however, it rapidly decreased after an Omicron infection episode and remained low. Vaccinated individuals who received two doses of COVID-19 failed to remain protected against Omicron within 14 weeks after the second dose.\n\nSimilar disparities were recorded among the hospitalized groups, although the differences were minor compared to those among individuals who sustained Omicron infection. Pre-Omicron period VE against hospitalization was durable and stable – above 85%. The post-Omicron infection VE sustained at 80% until the 25th week and decreased with time. Yet, limited protection against hospitalization persisted throughout the study period.\n\nAge differences did not have much of an effect on the overall VE pattern. Of note, the VE against infection was relatively higher in individuals above 60. In addition, females expressed greater VE than males.\n\nFurthermore, mRNA vaccines had higher VE against infection compared to AZD1222.

    "Energy crisis: UK fracks back, France fast-tracks offshore wind, Sweden lets off steam": "The Empire fracks back\n\nThe UK’s new business and energy secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg has fulfilled expectations of his approach to the crucial portfolio by this week lifting the 2019 moratorium on shale gas production in England, and flagging a new oil and gas licensing round.\n\n“In light of Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine and weaponisation of energy, strengthening our energy security is an absolute priority, and – as the Prime Minister said – we are going to ensure the UK is a net energy exporter by 2040,” Rees-Mogg said in a statement on Thursday.\n\n“To get there we will need to explore all avenues available to us through solar, wind, oil and gas production – so it’s right that we’ve lifted the pause to realise any potential sources of domestic gas.”\n\nThe decision has received a good deal of public and political criticism – although Rees-Mogg rather sensationally claimed in parliament this week that opposition to fracking in England is being curried up by Putin.\n\nScientists and economists presumably not on Putin’s payroll argue that fracking will not ease the energy crisis or bring down heating bills, but will compromise climate targets and cause other kinds of environmental damage.\n\nMacron launches France’s first offshore wind farm, hits accelerator on renewables\n\nMeanwhile, on the other side of the Channel, French President Emmanuel Macron has called for a “massive acceleration” of renewables development in France, including offshore wind farms and solar power.\n\nMacron aims to do this through new measures that will reduce the time it takes to build and commission offshore wind farms, from 10-12 years now to about six years, and for solar farms from six years to three years.\n\nA new bill will also aim to deliver connections to the grid for new renewable energy projects as soon as they are ready to start generating — getting rid of the current delay of up to three years.\n\n“We need a massive acceleration,” Macron said following a boat ride to inaugurate France’s first offshore wind farm off its Atlantic coast.\n\n[#LiveTweet] Nous sommes très fiers d’accueillir le Président de la République 🇫🇷 @EmmanuelMacron sur le Parc éolien en mer de Saint-Nazaire, 1er parc #EolienEnMer 🇫🇷 ➡️ Suivez dans ce #livetweet les étapes clés de cette visite pic.twitter.com/rtKHM3anOY — Parc Eolien en Mer de Saint-Nazaire (@EolienMerSNA) September 22, 2022\n\n\n\n“I want us to go at least twice as fast for renewable energy projects. … “our neighbors often managed to do more, better and, above all, faster.”\n\nThe 480MW Saint-Nazaire offshore wind farm – or Parc éolien en mer du Banc de Guérande – is located between 12km and 20km off the coast of the Guérande peninsula and features GE Haliade 150-6 MW turbines.\n\nThe project – the first of its kind for France – is owned and developed by Eolien Maritime France (EMF), a consortium of EDF Renouvelables, Enbridge, and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.\n\nConstruction is underway on another two French offshore wind farms, the Saint-Brieuc and Fécamp projects.\n\nEU proposes emergency handbrake for energy market\n\nEU regulator the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has proposed the introduction of an emergency brake on gas and power derivatives, to smooth the functioning of the energy market.\n\nThe ESMA says the measure would only be put in place for a limited period of time and triggered in exceptional circumstances, such as extreme spikes in volatility, which can lead to disorderly trading conditions.\n\n“It …seems reasonable to consider the implementation of a new type of trading suspension mechanism on a temporary basis and only for energy derivatives markets,” ESMA said in a statement.\n\nHey, it worked for Australia’s NEM! Or did it…\n\nGermany nationalises gas giant\n\nThe German government will take over 99 per cent of the shares of the country’s largest gas supplier, Uniper, replacing Finnish company Fortum as the majority owner, in a roughly €500 million transaction, Clean Energy Wire reports.\n\nEconomy minister Robert Habeck says the move, which provides some €8 billion in additional capital to Uniper, will stabilise the company that covers about 40 per cent of Germany’s gas supply.\n\n“This means Uniper will belong to the German state,” Habeck said, adding that legally completing the takeover would take roughly three months.\n\nThe minister also noted that gas levy Germany plans to impose on gas customers to save struggling importers and avoid a market collapse will go forward as planned – although it remains unclear whether Uniper will still be eligible to benefit from it.\n\nSweden lets off steam ahead of tough winter\n\nNews out of Sweden this week suggests that the global energy crisis has had the drastic impact of saunas being switched off in many cities, in a bid to lower consumption and reduce costs in the coming winter.\n\nAccording to reports, Malmo Mayor Katrin Stjernfeldt Jammeh said: “We have very energy-intensive leisure centers with saunas, with heated swimming pools for example, that’s the kind of thing we’re looking at to see if we need to close down temporarily or turn down.”\n\nGovernment authorities in 200 Swedish municipalities were also asked by the government to reduce their energy consumption before winter months.",
    "Sweden on ‘high alert’ for election interference amid Russia tensions": "Sweden has said it is on “high alert” for outside intervention in its upcoming election amid increased tensions with Russia.\n\nThe Scandinavian country’s recently re-established psychological defence agency said it had seen heightened activity from foreign sources following its application to join Nato and it was prepared for the possibility of “something exceptional” in the lead-up to polling day on 11 September.\n\nAfter a turbulent period for Swedish politics, including the resignation of Stefan Löfven as prime minister, the rise of Magdalena Andersson, the country’s first female leader, and threats from Vladimir Putin, the latest polls are exceptionally close in a highly charged campaign with a strong focus on immigration.\n\nIn what would be a seismic shift to the right, polls suggest the Sweden Democrats, rightwing populists with neo-Nazi roots, could be on track to replace the Moderates as Sweden’s second biggest party.\n\nGenerally elections have been a race between left-leaning parties led by Andersson’s Social Democrats and a centre-right coalition led by the Moderates, but even the latter party has in just a few years gone from urging Swedes to “open your hearts” to refugees to embracing the Sweden Democrats – a party whose leader, Jimmie Åkesson, has called for asylum to be cut to “close to zero”.\n\nSweden’s perceived vulnerabilities to foreign disinformation include on immigration, violent crime, schools, jobs, pensions and rising energy costs.\n\nMats Engström, a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations and a former adviser to a Social Democrat foreign minister, said while it was no surprise violent crime is in the spotlight as deadly shootings rise, discussion linking it to migration has “for years been reinforced by Russian and other troll factories”.\n\nHe said the Swedish election system was “robust” but disinformation aimed at the end of the election campaign would be much harder to counteract.\n\nMikael Östlund, a spokesperson for the psychological defence agency, said: ““We have a high alert all the time but we are aware of the fact that it might be an occasion that someone would like to harm Sweden, impact the Swedish democracy process, to do something exceptional towards the end of the election campaign.”\n\nThe cold war-era government body, intended to protect democracy, freedom of opinion and independence, was reintroduced in January amid rising fears over Russian aggression.\n\nÖstlund said it saw “increased activity” from outside the country, some of which was “quite intense”, after Sweden’s decision to apply to become a Nato member. Ongoing disinformation campaigns, understood to be coming from Russia, include claims that Sweden is a weak country and is not safe for refugees.\n\n“It’s something that we have seen before from Russian actors and also individuals,” Östlund said. “We know that foreign powers and countries that have the capacity might be interested in harming Sweden and harming the elections, or trying to widen divisions between ethnic groups.\n\n“So we are prepared for the event that during the last weeks, the closer to the election day we come, there might be something that occurs that we have quite a short time to counter.”\n\nIn the event of foreign intervention, options for countering it include going public with the breach and naming the source. A recently launched public awareness campaign warned “bli inte lurad” (don’t be fooled) and encouraged people to think about the source and publisher of information before sharing it online. A free online course from the agency shows how to protect against disinformation.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A prosecutor confirmed last week that Annie Lööf, the leader of the Centre party, was the planned target of a suspected terror attack, which killed another woman, at a political festival in Gotland in July.\n\nFrederik Bratt, the Swedish security service’s commanding officer for the election, said while there was no indication of an increased threat targeting the election, the ongoing threat of lone actors was “complex and a challenge”.\n\nEngström said if the Social Democrats held on to power after the election, it would largely be down to Andersson’s personal popularity, but if they lose the party’s focus on crime during the campaign will come under question. He said the Moderates also faced a backlash among the party’s former voters over its embrace of the Sweden Democrats, which could prove “catastrophic”.\n\n“If Moderate leader Ulf Kristersson still can form a new government, he will be very dependent on the Sweden Democrats,” Engström said. “This will affect Sweden’s policy also internationally, for example lower ambitions in climate policy.”\n\nIn Rinkeby, a Stockholm neighbourhood with a large immigrant population, Abebe Hailu, 69, was on Wednesday campaigning for the Social Democrats in front of a shipping container decorated in a poster that read “Our Stockholm region can do better”. He said the issues people care about most are welfare, schools, healthcare and jobs.\n\n“Our party thinks in the first-hand you should invest in children, before it becomes set,” he said.\n\nWelfare is the solution to problems in Swedish society, he added. “We must reduce the class gap between rich and poor and that means good schools for the children.”",

    "Heart Aerospace To Build Electric Aircraft Campus In Gothenburg, Sweden": "Gothenburg’s Säve airport will soon be home to an electric aircraft production and test flight ... [+] center. Heart Aerospace\n\nCommercial electric aviation took a big step closer to reality this week with the announcement of a new industry campus at Säve airport, a secondary airport just outside Gothenburg, Sweden.\n\nDriven by investment from Heart Aerospace, the campus named ‘Northern Runway’ will include offices, production and test flight facilities for electric aircraft. The first phase should be complete by 2024, with test flights beginning two years later.\n\nInterest in electric aviation is taking off\n\nHeart Aerospace has announced several electric aircraft designs in recent years and has received investment, letters of intent and letters of support from major airlines including Air Canada and Scandinavian Airlines (SAS).\n\nCurrently in the spotlight is the 30-seat ES-30. With an all-electric range of 200km (124 miles) and a hybrid range of 400km (248 miles), it has attracted interest from airlines operating in markets with a big demand for regional aviation.\n\nAir Canada has committed to buying 30 of the Heart Aerospace ES-30 electric aircraft. Heart Aerospace\n\nAir Canada likes the concept so much it has invested $5 million into the company and placed a purchase order for 30 of the new ES-30 aircraft. SAS has also confirmed its interest in the model.\n\nFounder and CEO Anders Forslund said the new project is about much more than developing one aircraft: “We have a plan and it’s not just to build a new electric airplane, but a whole new industry. With Northern Runway we will make electric air travel a reality and preserve flying for future generations.”\n\nA new industry for Gothenburg\n\nHeart’s choice of Sweden’s second biggest city for its new campus is no surprise as the company is already based there. The Northern Runway concept will form part of a wider development area for sustainable logistics and electric mobility named Gateway Säve.\n\nHeart COO Sofia Graflund said the city has “distinguished itself” in the emerging area of electrification, pointing out the world-class research facilities in battery technology and electrification. Gothenburg is also widely known in city planning circles as one of the world’s most sustainable cities.\n\nThe company expects its new facility to stimulate new jobs and plans on growing from 130 employees today to approximately 500 by 2025.",
    "U.S. ambassador: Finland and Sweden in NATO by Christmas": "U.S. ambassador: Finland and Sweden in NATO by Christmas\n\n“Finland is the most prepared to join NATO of any nation in modern history,” said Douglas Hickey, U.S. ambassador to Finland. “They see it as they’re going to defend someone else as well as themselves.” | U.S. Marine Corps photo by Cpl. Yvonna Guyette\n\nWith help from Lawrence Ukenye and Lee Hudson\n\nSubscribe here | Email Alex\n\nHELSINKI, Finland — Finland and Sweden will become official NATO members by Christmas, the U.S. ambassador to Finland predicted in a conversation with reporters and experts.\n\nOnly three of NATO’s 30 members are left to ratify the two countries’ accessions to the alliance. Slovakia is expected to give the green light while Hungary and Turkey continue to string the applicants along. The general assumption is that they both will wait until 2023 to make a final decision, with Turkey remaining in a holding pattern until after general elections in June 2023.\n\nBut DOUGLAS HICKEY, who was sworn into his role in April, said he’s optimistic NATO will have 32 members before the year is out. Conversations he’s had with his Hungarian counterpart in Helsinki led him to believe a positive vote will soon come, he told the group, warning the situation could change. But Hickey believes Turkish President RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN doesn’t want to be the lone holdout, incentivizing him to move quickly on the issue.\n\n“I don’t think he wants to be on an island too long,” he told your host during a meeting as part of a trip organized and sponsored by the German Marshall Fund of the United States. Time was of the essence, he implored, especially after Russian President VLADIMIR PUTIN ordered a partial mobilization of his military and threatened nuclear use. “We have to get this done. We have to stabilize this situation.”\n\nWhen Hickey was approached about becoming the ambassador to Finland, he called his friend JOHN KERRY about what the role would entail. The former secretary of State’s reply was “Russia, climate and NATO,” Hickey said. The climate portfolio takes up some of Hickey’s time, but Russia and NATO have dominated his agenda.\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine pushed Finland to join the alliance after decades of maintaining a relative independence, namely to maintain cordial ties with its neighbor. (And for good reason: Russia has invaded Finland three times over the past century.)\n\nThe majority of the alliance welcomed the reversal, but Erdogan claimed that Helsinki and Sweden were harboring terrorists and inconsiderate of Turkey’s security concerns. The three sides hammered out their issues (read: dealt with Erdogan’s tantrum) during the June NATO Summit in Madrid.\n\nThat pleased Hickey, who relayed that Turkey’s antics left Finland feeling like it “got punched in the face.”\n\nThe bruises might still be healing, but that isn’t affecting Helsinki’s push to be an official NATO member or making Washington rethink its full-throated support. Hickey boasted about how Finland will be “accretive” to the alliance with a Navy built for littoral combat, complementing much of NATO’s blue-water fleets, and an Air Force that will soon include the F-35.\n\n“Finland is the most prepared to join NATO of any nation in modern history,” Hickey said. “They see it as they’re going to defend someone else as well as themselves.”\n\n\n\nThe Inbox\n\nUKRAINE PLEADS FOR TANKS: Ukraine is asking urgently for modern tanks to help their forces seize on rapid gains in the northeast and take additional territory, but the West is dragging its feet, Lara reported alongside our own PAUL McLEARY and ERIN BANCO.\n\nThe tanks have shot to the top of Kyiv’s wish list as Ukraine presses its gains in the northeastern Donbas region amid the shocking Russian collapse this month. The request took on new urgency this week after Putin announced that he would mobilize 300,000 additional troops for the fight in Ukraine, a major escalation of the campaign.\n\nThe more modern American-made M-1 Abrams and German-made Leopard tanks would add a powerful punch that could help Kyiv’s forces capture and hold more ground, compared to the old Soviet-era tanks they currently operate, say experts and Ukrainian advisers. But top national security officials in both countries have hesitated to provide the tanks, in part due to the training and logistics challenges involved, according to U.S. officials, Ukrainian advisers and congressional aides.\n\nThe M-1s, for example, are a completely different system than the Soviet-era tanks Ukraine currently operates, and require significant maintenance and logistics support.\n\n“It’s a pretty high hurdle to get Ukraine not only U.S.-made tanks but the parts to maintain them,” said one U.S. official, who like others interviewed for this article spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing conversations. “You don’t want to give them something that’s going to break down and run out of gas and they can’t refuel them.”\n\nWestern-style tanks would provide a major upgrade to Kyiv’s armored force in terms of range, speed and fire control, allowing Ukrainian forces to hit a Russian target up to a mile and a half away and move before the enemy can shoot back, said retired Lt. Gen. BEN HODGES, a former commander of U.S. Army Europe.\n\nBut the training required and logistics tail — an M-1 division can consume up to 600,000 gallons of fuel a day — could hinder Ukraine’s movement, he cautioned.\n\n“These are not rental cars, there’s a lot that goes with it,” Hodges said. “You are basically adding hundreds of additional things that would have to be carried along.… You look at a U.S. Army tank company today, there are thousands of gallons of fuel following behind them every day.”\n\nIT’S THURSDAY: Thanks for tuning in to NatSec Daily.

It’s been a year since the Afghan air force flew dozens of U.S.-donated aircraft across the border to Uzbekistan and Tajikistan as the Taliban overran Kabul last year — and the aircraft are still sitting there. As Lara scooped earlier this week, the U.S. is currently negotiating with the two Central Asian countries to trade the aircraft for help hunting terrorists in Afghanistan.\n\nNatSec Daily obtained an early copy of a new report from LUKE COFFEY at the Hudson Institute that provides some key context for these negotiations. He notes that Tajikistan harbors sympathies for the ethnic Tajik minority that comprises much of the National Resistance Front, the opposition group based in Afghanistan’s Panjshir Province that continues to fight against the Taliban.\n\nThe Biden administration has been hesitant to support the NRF at least publicly and has yet to invite the leader, AHMAD MASSOUD, to Washington, D.C. But Coffey argues in his report that the U.S. and the international community must consider how to support the NRF, including formally transferring the former Afghan Air Force aircraft to the Tajik Air Force and helping the Tajiks develop a maintenance plan for the planes.\n\nThe long-term objective, Coffey writes, would be “to ensure that the aircraft are available for NRF use in the future.”\n\nTHWARTED ISIS SUICIDE ATTACK IN SYRIA: The U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces successfully thwarted a planned ISIS suicide bomber attack on the al-Hol refugee camp earlier this week, U.S. Central Command announced today. The SDF forces interdicted seven ISIS fighters in two vehicles heading in the direction of the camp at approximately 12:25 a.m. on Sept. 20, according to a statement.\n\n\"One vehicle — rigged with explosives and personnel wearing explosive suicide vests — prematurely exploded near the Um Fakik village, approximately 12 miles northeast of the intended target at al-Hol. This explosion alerted Syrian Democratic Forces operating in the area who then arrived within minutes and surrounded the second vehicle,” according to a CENTCOM statement.\n\n\"Two men exited the second vehicle wearing suicide vests. One detonated his vest. Syrian Democratic Forces shot and killed the second man. The second vehicle was rigged with at least 50 kilograms of explosives.”\n\nFour ISIS fighters were killed in the engagement, and one is now in SDF custody. No SDF troops were killed or wounded.\n\nRUSSIAN MILITARY DIVIDED: The highest ranks of the Russian military are in disarray as Ukraine continues its rapid advances in the northeast, writes CNN’s KATIE BO LILLIS, with Putin himself giving directions to generals in the field and Russian officers arguing amongst themselves about decision-making in Washington.\n\n“Russia's military is divided over how best to counter Ukraine's unexpected battlefield advances this month, according to multiple sources familiar with US intelligence, as Moscow has found itself on the defensive in both the east and the south,” Lillis writes.\n\n“Russian President Vladimir Putin is himself giving directions directly to generals in the field, two sources familiar with US and western intelligence said — a highly unusual management tactic in a modern military that these sources said hints at the dysfunctional command structure that has plagued Russia's war from the beginning.”\n\n“Intelligence intercepts have captured Russian officers arguing among themselves and complaining to friends and relatives back home about decision-making from Moscow, one of these sources told CNN.”\n\n“And there are significant disagreements on strategy with military leaders struggling to agree on where to focus their efforts to shore up defensive lines, multiple sources familiar with US intelligence said.”\n\n\n\nKeystrokes\n\n‘IT JUST DIDN’T WORK’: NatSec Daily wants to point out another interesting tidbit from the Hickey conversation: He believes Russia did try to harm Finland in cyberspace after its decision to join NATO.\n\n“I don’t think for a minute that the Russians didn’t try,” the U.S. ambassador to Finland said. “We assume the Russians didn’t do anything from a cyber perspective,” but it’s likely Moscow did do something, and “it just didn’t work.”\n\nFinland has a very digitized society that it’s protected diligently well over the years. Recent attacks on Finnish banks, for example, didn’t have much of an effect on the country’s financial sector. It’s therefore possible Russian hackers launched serious cyber offenses, only to have them repelled.\n\nAnother possibility, per officials in Helsinki and Riga, is that Russia is just too tied up with the physical war that it can’t focus on the cyber one. Whatever the answer, many expect Russia to go big in cyberspace at some point down the line — it’s just a matter of when and how.\n\n\n\nThe Complex\n\nSHOW ME THE MONEY: Ukrainian advisers and Republican staffers are sounding the alarm this week because the Biden administration has not asked Congress to roll over authorization to ship another $2.2 billion worth of weapons and equipment for use in Ukraine after it expires at the end of the fiscal year.\n\nTop Pentagon officials stress that the money itself is not expiring, but Congress must re-authorize the ability to draw down equipment. The administration has requested lawmakers include $3.6 billion in new drawdown authority for Ukraine in a temporary continuing resolution to begin the fiscal year while negotiations continue on full-year spending bills. Congress will likely grant this request as well as attach emergency funding to the CR.\n\nThe reason the administration has not asked Congress to roll over the existing authorization is because Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee conveyed that their preference was to let the old authorization expire and instead put in a new request for additional funds, a U.S. official told NatSec Daily. Either way, the White House does not anticipate any gaps in funding for Ukraine, the official said.\n\nBut congressional staffers say it’s a bad look, and unnecessarily delays shipping much-needed aid to Ukraine. It also leaves the administration open to accusations it is trying to slow down aid to Kyiv in order to avoid provoking Putin, they say. The administration does not anticipate another drawdown before the end of the fiscal year.\n\n“All this is coming to a head when the Ukrainians have got momentum, and we’re hemming and hawing and wringing our hands,” one staffer said.\n\nDECISION TIME ON GRAY EAGLE: A bipartisan group of 17 House lawmakers sent a letter to Defense Secretary LLOYD AUSTIN Wednesday demanding that the department speed up its monthslong review of whether to supply Ukraine with Gray Eagle drones.\n\nPentagon leadership has been debating whether to send the drones since the spring, with concerns over technology transfer and their survivability keeping the issue alive, but with no resolution.\n\n“Risk assessments and mitigation should not come at the expense of Ukrainian lives,” the lawmakers wrote in the letter obtained by POLITICO, adding “should the decision be made to transfer Gray Eagles then it should be done expeditiously.”\n\nIf the Pentagon decides not to provide the technology, “that needs to be communicated quickly and clearly to afford our Ukrainian partners the opportunity to make alternative plans,” the letter said.\n\nThe letter was spearheaded by Congressional Ukrainian Caucus members Reps. MARCY KAPTUR (D-Ohio), BRIAN FITZPATRICK (R-Pa.), MIKE QUIGLEY (D-Ill.) and ANDY HARRIS (R-Md.).\n\n\n\nOn The Hill\n\nREPUBLICANS SLAM LANDMINE BAN: The top Republicans on the House and Senate Armed Services, Senate Foreign Relations and House Foreign Affairs panels are renewing their opposition to Biden's June decision to widely limit the use of anti-personnel landmines, our own CONNOR O’BRIEN reports.\n\nSens. JIM INHOFE (R-Okla.) and JIM RISCH (R-Ind.) and Reps. MIKE ROGERS (R-Ala.) and MICHAEL MCCAUL (R-Texas) slammed limiting the use of mines — a move by Biden to reverse a more expansive Trump-era policy — and argued landmines \"remain an important tool in modern warfare\" in a letter to Secretary of State ANTONY BLINKEN, SecDef Austin and Joint Chiefs Chair Gen. MARK MILLEY scooped by Connor (for Pros!).\n\n\"Considering the obvious operational benefits of anti-personnel landmines, the United States should not unnecessarily issue a policy depriving U.S. troops access to anti-personnel landmines currently in DoD stocks simply to pursue an ideal that our adversaries will not follow,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"Implementing such a blanket policy seems particularly questionable when one considers that all landmines currently in the U.S. operational inventory already incorporate technologically advanced safeguards limiting harm to noncombatants.\"\n\nSPACE FORCE, NUCLEAR PICKS APPROVED: Senate Armed Services approved a swath of civilian and military nominees today, including Biden's pick to be just the second head of the Space Force in the service's brief history.\n\nSenators signed off on Lt.

    "Sweden and the revolt against the evasive elites": "So now we know: nowhere is immune to the populist surge. Not even Sweden. Not even every European liberals’ favourite welfarist state. Once considered the happy country of Europe, an oasis of technocratic calm in an often unpredictable continent, now even Sweden has been rattled by populism. In last week’s election the Sweden Democrats, a right-wing nationalist party, emerged as the second largest party in parliament. And this has shaken not only the political class in Stockholm but liberal elites around the world. It’s a ‘dramatic shift’, says the New York Times. ‘Astonishing’, says Deutsche Welle. An ‘earthquake’, insist leftist observers. They sound like the troops of an embattled army watching their last patch of territory be conquered by the enemy.\n\nThe feeling that Sweden has fallen – and that its falling represents a blow to correct-thinking people everywhere – is palpable. We all looked upon Sweden as the ‘bedrock of Nordic liberalism’, say two writers for the NYT. And that makes its ‘move toward the more populist right’ seem especially ‘shocking’. It’s one thing for eccentric Britain to succumb to the populist bug, with our vote for Brexit, and for the crazy United States to take a temporary punt on Trump. But Sweden? That social-democratic paradise Guardian columnists dream of retiring to? Many will be asking ‘How did this happen?’, says a startled-sounding Deutsche Welle. How on earth, in this Northern European ‘bastion of tolerance’, did a ‘nationalist party’ find itself surging in the polls? The alarm of the elites is striking. And telling. They seem to be clocking, finally, that their cultural and political values are not safe anywhere. Not even in Sweden. The election results were indeed remarkable. The Sweden Democrats, a party notable for its anti-immigration and anti-Islam stances, stormed into second place. They won 20.5 per cent of the vote. Not bad for a party that only made its debut in the Riksdag – the Swedish parliament – in 2010, when it won six per cent of the vote. That rose to 13 per cent in the 2014 election and 18 per cent in the 2018 election. Now, in terms of seats in parliament, the Sweden Democrats are second only to the Social Democrats, the party that has governed Sweden for most of the past century. Imagine the EDL nipping at the heels of a Labour government in the UK.\n\nThe Sweden Democrats were part of a right-wing bloc that won the election, if narrowly. The Social Democrat prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, conceded defeat and resigned. Ulf Kristersson of the centre-right Moderate party (which won 19.1 per cent of the vote) is now the prime minister in waiting and must stitch together a government. Whether that government will include the Sweden Democrats, or whether they’ll just agitate from the backbenches, remains to be seen. For years there has been a pact in the Swedish establishment never to engage with the Sweden Democrats. That is how significant the election result is. That is why it feels like an ‘earthquake’. Because a party that was treated as a political untouchable, as so vile that a cordon sanitaire had to be put around it, is now the second-largest in parliament, with a remarkable 73 seats. No wonder the managerial elites everywhere from New York to Berlin to Stockholm are reeling. The Sweden Democrats do indeed have disturbing origins. They have their roots in neo-Nazi movements of the 1980s, rallying under the slogan Keep Sweden Swedish. But they’ve changed a great deal. Under the leadership of Jimmie Akesson, just 26 years old when he took over the party in 2005, the Sweden Democrats moved away from their ‘far-right roots’ and took a ‘more populist direction’. And they made huge inroads with certain sections of the electorate. Not the middle classes in Stockholm, of course – strikingly, they had a poor showing in the capital – but rather among what one journalist rather sniffily refers to as ‘undereducated people’ who think the ‘Social Democrats are not representing their interests anymore’. Class and education are strong predictors of who’s likely to vote for the Sweden Democrats. As a Swedish social scientist points out, ‘Voters with university degrees are strongly unrepresented among [Sweden Democrats] voters’. A poll in 2022 found that sympathy for the Sweden Democrats was far higher among blue-collar workers than white-collar workers. So 24.5 per cent of unskilled blue-collar workers expressed a preference for the party, compared with just 8.3 per cent of high-level white-collar workers.\n\nThis echoes the populist moment elsewhere in Europe, and in the US too, where education is very often a key dividing line in electoral behaviour. People who have never darkened the door of a university – and who therefore have not been so exposed to the values and etiquette of the new elites – seem far more content to turn their backs on the increasingly woke establishment and to take a chance on populist upstarts. That many blue-collar folk in Sweden are finally doing this is not surprising. It isn’t because they’re racist. They’re not drawn to the Sweden Democrats because it has some neo-Nazi cranks in its past. Rather, they are revolting against their evasive elites. Against an establishment that seems to be in wilful denial about the problems confronting society, and which will brand you a hateful bigot if you dare to raise those problems. The political life of Sweden has been defined by evasion in recent years. The establishment parties, especially the Social Democrats, flat-out refused to be honest about the social disturbances afflicting Swedish society. Crime and violence have soared. There are now so many grenade attacks in Sweden that it is the only country other than Mexico in which police record the number of such attacks. Explosions generally are rising. As a BBC report in 2019 asked: ‘Sweden’s 100 explosions this year: What’s going on?’ In 2020 alone there were more than 200 explosions and 360 shootings. Sweden is the only country in Europe in which gun murders have surged since the year 2000. Then there are the religious riots. Earlier this year there were Islamist uprisings across Sweden. In various cities, Muslim mobs set fire to cars and hurled stones at cops following a right-wing provocateur’s burning of the Koran. Sweden’s national police chief said he had ‘never seen such violent riots’.\n\nThat much of this spike in crime and rioting followed Sweden’s huge intake of asylum seekers in 2015 has made this a tetchy, touchy subject. Swedish politicians and commentators, keen to dampen down what they consider to be the racist tendencies of the Swedish masses, tended to downplay the social instability. Outside observers did likewise. Remember the trouble Trump got into when he said Sweden was experiencing some big social and cultural problems? Don’t be ridiculous, the chattering classes of the West said – Sweden is fine. But it wasn’t fine. And its problems were at least partly a consequence of a crisis of integration, of the failure on Sweden’s part to assimilate the tens of thousands of largely Middle Eastern migrants it accepted in 2015. Consider this: four esteemed social scientists in Sweden examined the rape trends of the past two decades. They found that of those convicted of rape, 40.8 per cent were Swedish-born with Swedish parents, and 47.7 per cent were born outside of Sweden. Most of those were from the Middle East or North Africa. That is something to discuss, right? Apparently not. Too often, debate was shushed, demonised. The end result was as predictable as it was dire: social instability intensified as the elites looked the other way. Eventually things got so bad that the PM, Magdalena Andersson, said Sweden had to talk about it. We can no longer ignore the fact, she said earlier this year, that we have ‘parallel societies in Sweden’, that ‘integration has been too poor at the same time as we have had large [amounts of] immigration’. But it was too little, too late. Many voters had already turned their backs on Ms Andersson’s Social Democrat party and moved towards the Sweden Democrats, for the simple reason that they wanted someone – anyone – to talk about Sweden’s transformation from a relatively stable welfare-oriented society into a nation beset by gang violence and identitarian grievance. It was the evasions of the elite, their stricture against open, honest commentary, that encouraged many to look to the Sweden Democrats.",
    "Swedish firms optimistic about outlook in Malaysia, survey shows": "KUALA LUMPUR (Sept 26): Many Swedish firms are optimistic about the overall economic outlook in Malaysia, with expectations of increased turnover and plans to increase their investments in the country in the next 12 months, according to a survey contributed by Team Sweden.\n\nTeam Sweden comprises the Swedish Trade and Invest Council (known as Business Sweden in Malaysia), Sweden's Embassy in Malaysia, and the Malaysian-Sweden Business Association (Masba).\n\nOf the 41 companies which completed the Malaysia Business Climate Survey 2022, being conducted during the second and third quarters of this year, 80% of those polled expect turnover to increase in the wake of a resumption of business activities.\n\nThe survey report was launched on Monday (Sept 26) by Team Sweden, represented by Swedish Ambassador to Malaysia, Dr. Joachim Bergström; Trade Commissioner of Sweden to Malaysia, The Swedish Trade & Invest Council, Emma Broms; and Masba president Carl Malmqvist.\n\nThe report noted that 54% of companies expect to slightly or significantly increase their investments, compared with 39% in the previous survey done in 2020.\n\n“Only 10% of companies plan to reduce investments, compared to 14% previously. This is a strong sign of confidence in Malaysia and demonstrates that despite the impact of Covid-19, Malaysia will continue to be an attractive destination for Swedish companies to invest and grow in Asia,” said the report.\n\nIt observed that Swedish companies experienced higher profitability in 2021, than in 2019.\n\n“66% of the Swedish companies [were] profitable in 2021, compared to 61% in 2019. Similarly, the number of companies operating at a loss has decreased from 20% in 2019 to 7% in 2021,” said the report.\n\nMost respondents have a neutral or positive perception of the current business climate in Malaysia, with 46% “neutral” and another 44% perceiving the climate as “good” or “very good”.\n\nComparably, the number of companies expressing that the business climate is “poor” or “very poor” decreased to 7% in 2022, from 11% in 2020.\n\nAbout 53% of the companies that responded to the survey have more than 1,000 global employees.\n\nThe respondents come from a wide range of industries. Industrial companies represent the largest sector at 47%, followed by professional services at 38%, and consumer companies at 16%.\n\nWhile most Swedish businesses in Malaysia remain focused on Peninsular Malaysia and have limited activities in Sabah and Sarawak, two out of three respondents have a plan to grow their business in the two Borneo states.\n\n“Some see great potential in the area, while others are more sceptical of the opportunities. Several respondents stated that they have not investigated the region yet, but that they see the growth and need to start developing a presence soon,” the report said.\n\nThis report also highlighted that Swedish companies perceive “personal safety”, “access to distributors”, and “service providers” to be key advantages in doing business in Malaysia.\n\n“However, concerns and challenges highlighted in the 2020 survey remain in place today. The lack of transparency, unsatisfactory labour market regulations, and finding skilled labour locally continue to be big struggles for Swedish companies present in Malaysia,” it added.\n\nA number of companies expressed concerns regarding the ability to bring in specialised staff from abroad.\n\n“It is noteworthy that the companies that experienced difficulties in bringing in specialised staff from abroad were also more likely to respond that they would not invest more in Malaysia, indicating improved visa arrangements would go a long way towards attracting more Swedish investment,” the report said.\n\nSome 77% of the companies surveyed said they had not experienced bribery or fraud, and 86% said they had not witnessed human or labour rights abuse.\n\nIn total, there are about 90 Swedish companies based in Malaysia.\n\nIn her presentation, trade commissioner Brooms said Swedish exports to Malaysia amounted to US$400 million in 2021, while Malaysian exports to Sweden reached US$600 million.",

    "Sweden taking Turkey 'seriously' on Nato demands": "Sweden and Finland are counting on further talks with Turkey to unlock their Nato accession, as Western diplomats wonder what Ankara really wants.\n\n\"The Swedish government takes the implementation of the memorandum very seriously,\" the Swedish foreign ministry told EUobserver on Thursday (15 September), referring to a deal made in June with Turkey to go after alleged Kurdish terrorists in return for Nato entry.\n\nStudent or retired? Then this plan is for you.\n\n\"Further meetings in the trilateral format between Sweden, Finland, and Türkiye are foreseen,\" the Swedish ministry said, following the last such talks on 26 August.\n\nFinland is also \"working together with Türkiye to organise further meetings at expert level,\" its foreign ministry said.\n\nThey spoke after Turkish foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoglu warned one day earlier the Turkish parliament wouldn't ratify the Nordic Nato bids if they didn't play ball. \"No concrete steps have been taken up to today,\" by Stockholm or Helsinki to satisfy Ankara, he declared.\n\nFinland and Sweden are joining the Western alliance to protect themselves from Russia, in a tectonic shift in European security in reaction to the Ukraine war.\n\nSome 24 out of 30 Nato members have already ratified the move in the fastest-paced accession process in its history, showing the overwhelming support for Nordic enlargement.\n\nBut Turkey first wants Sweden to extradite 73 Kurdish separatist suspects and for Finland to hand over 12 more.\n\nIt also wants them to tighten national terrorism laws and to sell Turkey high-end weapons systems, in demands which are being fulfilled.\n\nÇavuşoglu's warning was prompted by the formation of a new right-wing government in Stockholm, including the far-right Sweden Democrats party, following elections last Sunday.\n\nBut the Sweden Democrats endorse Nato entry, and right-wing Swedish voters will likely be more comfortable with extraditing Kurdish exiles than supporters of the outgoing centre-left government would have been.\n\nAnd despite Çavuşoglu's tough talk, few in the EU or Nato think Ankara expects to get everything it wants.\n\nTurkey's demands on Finnish extraditions, for one, could easily melt away because they are largely symbolic. \"There is no PKK in Finland,\" an EU diplomat said, referring to a leading Kurdish militant group.\n\nTurkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's \"frustration\" with Sweden giving safe harbour to so many Kurds was more \"real\", Jamie Shea, a former senior Nato official, told this website.\n\nBut given the high burden of proof from Turkey that Swedish courts will require to substantiate terrorism charges, \"it is highly unlikely that all the individuals on Ankara's list will be handed over\", Shea also said.\n\n\"Erdoğan knows that he cannot stop the [Nato enlargement] process indefinitely, whatever the rhetoric from Ankara, and so my sense is that he will declare victory after a few symbolic extraditions and lift his objections,\" Shea said.\n\nTurkish elections\n\nThat still leaves the question of when Erdoğan might budge.\n\nFinland and Sweden are not covered by Nato's mutual defence clause until the day they join, amid concern over the potential for a sudden flare-up in Russian aggression in the Baltic region.\n\nBut Erdoğan is preparing to fight elections in June next year amid an economic slump in Turkey, and his spin-doctors might want to drag out the Nato dispute as long as possible for campaign reasons, the EU diplomat said.\n\n\"It makes him [Erdoğan] look like an important player on the world stage,\" the diplomat noted.\n\n\"It also has a rallying-round-the-flag effect on Turkish nationalists and on those large portions of Turkish society where anti-Americanism is rife,\" he said.\n\n\"Erdoğan has other cards to play, such as creating a new migration or Mediterranean gas-drilling crisis with Greece,\" the diplomat added. \"His people are obsessed with opinion polls, and they'll be frantically doing surveys to see how each of his moves plays out,\" the EU diplomat said.\n\nTurkey sent thousands of Syrian refugees to the Greek border two years ago. It dispatched a ship in August to resume gas exploration in an area criss-crossed by rival territorial claims.\n\nMeanwhile, the Finnish and Swedish bids are proceeding so swiftly because they already became de facto Nato members in military-technical terms during years of close cooperation.\n\nThere is very little left for Nato itself to do to wrap up the process following member states' ratifications, Shea, who now teaches war studies at the University of Exeter in the UK, said.\n\nThis includes tweaking its budget and legal documents.\n\n\"Nato commanders will need to revise their contingency plans for the defence of Europe to cover Swedish and Finnish territory, which includes islands in the Baltic Sea,\" Shea said.\n\n\"They will also be proposing Swedish and Finnish military contributions for the defence of other allies. But again, given the recent closeness of Sweden and Finland to Nato, they probably finalised these plans, at least informally, months or even years ago already,\" he said.",

Alexander will therefore leave the squad.\"\n\nManager Janne Andersson added: \"It is of course sad, mainly for Alex, but also for us as a team. But after speaking with both our medical team and Alex, it is the right decision for him to leave. I hope he is back as soon as possible.\"\n\nIsak, who started three of his country's four games in June, was disappointed at having to pull out.\n\nHe said: \"It feels very sad to have to leave the team. I had longed to play in the blue and yellow shirt again.

    "A far-right party in Sweden has grown more influential in recent years": "A far-right party in Sweden has grown more influential in recent years\n\nNPR's Steve Inskeep talks to correspondent Charlie Duxbury of Politico Europe, about the rise of the Sweden Democrats, from a neo-Nazi group to an influential political party after Sunday's elections.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nA far-right party with roots in neo-Nazi groups is expected to play a central role in Sweden's next coalition government.\n\nA MARTINEZ, HOST:\n\nThe Sweden Democrats have grown more influential in recent years after it moderated some of its positions and expelled some of its extremist members. Its anti-immigration, tough on crime platform resonated with Swedish voters in Sunday's election.\n\nINSKEEP: Charlie Duxbury is the Stockholm correspondent for Politico Europe and joins us. Welcome.\n\nCHARLIE DUXBURY: Good morning.\n\nINSKEEP: I just heard A say they moderated their positions. What did they stand for in the past, and what do they stand for now?\n\nDUXBURY: Yes, so the Sweden Democrats do have roots in neo-Nazi groups of the late '80s, early '90s in Sweden. In the years since, they kind of cleaned things up and moved more towards the mainstream, but they still stand for a very hard line on immigration and a hard line on law and order. And that's what seems to have attracted voters in Sunday's vote.\n\nINSKEEP: Hasn't Sweden welcomed a relatively large number of refugees from the Middle East and elsewhere in recent years?\n\nDUXBURY: That's right. During Europe's migration crisis from 2015 onwards, Sweden took a relatively large number of those asylum-seekers. And the government at the time, social democratic government, was relatively welcoming in the same way that Germany was, and tens of thousands of asylum-seekers arrived in Sweden. Since then, there's been a kind of backlash in - among some groups, particularly the Sweden Democrats, who said that that was a mistake and that the integration of immigrants since then has been a failure.\n\nINSKEEP: Well, what does it mean that they did so well in Sunday's election? And how much influence do they now have? They wouldn't be leading the coalition, I guess.\n\nDUXBURY: No. So the count's still ongoing. We should have a final result by this evening. What is expected to happen is that the center-right moderate party will lead the government but will lean heavily on the Sweden Democrats, who achieved a score of about 20% of the vote on Sunday. And the Sweden Democrats will be under pressure from their own voters to show that they can deliver on some quite ambitious campaign pledges to cut down on immigration, to increase policing powers in sentencing in the courts in Sweden. So that will be a closely watched discussion over the days and weeks to come.\n\nINSKEEP: Is the center-right party that seems likely to lead the coalition in a position where they would essentially have to do what the Sweden Democrats demand on their particular issues to keep the coalition together?\n\nDUXBURY: They'll certainly have to offer some serious concessions to the Sweden Democrats to hold this loose coalition together. They may decide to offer them ministerial positions. They may decide to try and run a minority government with the Sweden Democrats outside. But either way, the Sweden Democrats are going to demand serious influence over the government in the four-year mandate period to come, and they will have to show the voters that they've achieved that.\n\nINSKEEP: Charlie Duxbury, correspondent for Politico Europe in Stockholm, thanks so much.\n\nDUXBURY: Thank you.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nCopyright © 2022 NPR.

    "Far-right politics, once too extreme for Sweden, now finds a sturdy foundation": "One after another, Europe’s traditional centre-right parties are facing a hard choice: when do they swallow their post-1945 scruples about fascism and agree to cooperate with their resident far-right ethno-nationalist parties?\n\nNext stop: Sweden. Next week’s elections seem set to position the once-thought-too-extreme Swedish Democrats, now with more than 20% of the vote, as the major party on the right -- leaving their more centrist right-wing colleagues having to get on board, as no Swedish Democrats means no right-wing government.\n\nIt’s a dilemma. Do they opt for democratic solidarity at the price of a continued Social Democratic government? Or for a “no enemies on the right” accord that legitimates the once-fringe post-fascist party that only broke into Parliament in 2010?",
    "Understanding Turkiye’s Opposition to Sweden and Finland’s NATO Membership - Australian Institute of International Affairs": "Turkiye’s voiced strong opposition to Swedish and Finnish bids to join NATO. Its goal was to call more attention to Turkiye’s legitimate security concerns and remind members that it is a long-standing ally.\n\nWhen Russia attacked Ukraine on 24 February 2022, one of the main founding principles of the international establishment was attacked: the territorial integrity of a sovereign state. Europe’s political response to this attack was more solid than expected, and the EU surprised the most with its fast and firm policies towards the aggression, including sanctions and open borders for migrants coming from the region. Finland and Sweden’s decision to join the NATO was another interesting step, since they had previously considered membership to the alliance as an “unnecessary provocation of Moscow.”\n\nIn May 2022, Sweden and Finland applied for membership to join NATO. Turkiye’s objection came swiftly. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said Turkiye did not have a positive opinion about their membership and Foreign Minister Mevlut Çavuşoğlu emphasised that “Sweden and Finland have to stop support for terrorists (including the PKK) and provide clear security guarantees and lift export bans on Turkiye before joining the alliance.” By the end of June 2022, foreign ministers of three countries signed a memorandum in which Turkiye’s security concerns were addressed, clearly stating that “Finland and Sweden will not provide support to YPG/PYD, and the organisation described as FETO in Turkiye.” Export bans on Turkiye were also addressed: “In future, defence exports from Finland and Sweden will be conducted in line with Alliance solidarity and in accordance with the letter and spirit of article 3 of the Washington Treaty.”\n\nAdditionally, Turkiye had deportation and extradition requests from these two countries, which became a problem in the follow-up of the memorandum. Sweden extradited a man who is accused of fraud. Both Finland and Sweden started the process of extradition of some of the people requested by Turkiye, but neither accepted the extradition of everyone on the list. As the memorandum foresaw, the three countries met under the Permanent Joint Mechanism in Vantaa, Finland at the end of August, and officials stated that the mechanism will continue at the expert level during the coming months.\n\nIn this process Turkiye demonstrated that as a NATO member, it has an expectation that allies pay particular attention to its legitimate security concerns. In this framework, Turkiye’s demands regarding the terrorist groups such as the Kurdistan Worker’s Party (PKK) and its close associate, the People’s Defence Units (YPG), and Fethullahist Terrorist Organisation (FETÖ) need to be addressed by the newcomers to the alliance. Thus, Turkiye’s opposition to the membership of Sweden and Finland to NATO should not be seen as a structural opposition, but rather as an alarm to increase awareness and cooperation against security threats that Turkiye considers vital for itself.\n\nWhat about further motives?\n\nIn order to better understand Turkiye’s opposition one should carefully look at the recent developments in Turkish foreign policy for context.\n\nOne of the biggest debates over Turkish foreign policy has always been whether Turkiye’s foreign policy axis is shifting towards the East. Especially since Turkiye’s purchase of Russian S-400s and dismissal from the US F-35 project the emphasis on this shift has become more visible. Turkiye’s possible strategic partnership with Russia due to deeper cooperation in security field was an issue, but Turkiye’s strategic priorities did not coincide with Russian priorities, particularly toward Libya and Syria. And although Turkiye was not anti-Russian, it has had a pro-Ukrainian approach since the annexation of Crimea in 2014. When we look at Turkiye’s position on the Finnish and Swedish application to NATO then, we see that Turkiye highlighted its status as a NATO member rather than its close relations with Russia.\n\nAnother motivation here was to dissuade the US from fostering relations with the YPG and Democratic Union Party(PYD) in northern Syria. The US has been in close cooperation with these groups, which Turkiye considers the Syrian branch of the PKK and therefore a fundamental threat to its territorial integrity and security. In relations between Turkiye and the US, this has been one of the key problems. For instance, in 2017, President Erdoğan stated, “It is absolutely unacceptable to take the YPG-PYD into consideration as partners in the region,” and still Turkiye considers any connection with YPG/PYD as a direct aid to the PKK.\n\nTurkiye’s opposition to Swedish and Finnish bids was also perceived as a part of a grand bargain. This would “involve lessened Western support for the PYD-PKK in exchange for Ankara easing up the pressure on the organization. Adding new weapons sales to Turkiye into the mix probably would seal the deal.” Also, as Han argued, through these bids, “Erdoğan is not addressing Helsinki or Stockholm” but “he is trying to give a message…. You have to make a broad bargain with me about Turkiye’s problems with the West.” Some other motivations are more related to domestic politics than foreign policy priorities. Involving the public in opposition against the “Finnish and Swedish bids, rather than opting for quiet diplomacy, Erdoğan hopes that the issue will help to consolidate his public support” as the elections approach. On the other hand, President Erdoğan’s may be seeking to “divert attention from the dire state of Turkiye’s economy.”\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough Turkiye has adopted a harsh rhetoric, especially in the last decade, against the “West,” not only the ruling elite but also the public see that NATO is important in keeping Turkiye safe in its region. The latest public opinion polls conducted by Istanbul Economics Research and EDAM demonstrate that the percentage of the people who think NATO is necessary for Turkiye’s security has gone up by more than 20 points, and reaching 51.3 percent in October 2021. The same public opinion polls show that support for security cooperation with Russia and membership to Shanghai Cooperation Organization instead of NATO went down considerably.\n\nAll these arguments in relation to Turkiye’s motivation for opposing Swedish and Finnish NATO membership come down to attempts to normalise Turkiye’s relations with its traditional allies and going back to traditional foreign policy roles in its region – conducting a balancing act while having close links to Western partners. The geopolitical and geoeconomic realities force Turkiye to be more flexible, while systemic international pressures continue to push for adjustment in Turkish foreign policy. Lately, we have seen Turkiye taking steps in normalising relations with Israel, conducting a balancing policy in the Black Sea region in the talks for opening the wheat corridor, and sending a delegation to the US for ensuring the supply of F16s to modernise the ones at hand. Hence, Turkiye’s opposition to Swedish and Finnish NATO bids not only aims to call for more attention to its legitimate security concerns but also to remind the international community that it is a long-standing ally in the organisation.\n\nDr Çiğdem Üstün is Associate Professor of International Relations Department, Nişantaşı University and Secretary General at Center for Economics and Foreign Policy Research (EDAM), İstanbul.

    "Vattenfall commissions pilot facility in 100GWh green hydrogen underground cavern in Sweden": "The cavern project in Sweden. Image: SSAB.\n\nSwedish state-owned energy company Vattenfall has commissioned a green hydrogen storage pilot facility within a 100GWh capacity cavern.\n\nThe HYBRIT facility in Luleå, north Sweden, is a collaboration between Vattenfall, steel company SSAB and iron ore producer LKAB.\n\nIt was inaugurated in June and, following initial pressure tests, has now been filled with hydrogen gas up to a maximum operating pressure of 250 bar. A two-year test period has now started and will continue until 2024.\n\nThe technology will eventually go towards SSAB sponge iron production operations, but the announcement’s wording indicates the next two years is mainly just testing the hydrogen storage capabilities. Sponge iron is produced by reducing iron ore into iron using a reducing gas or elemental carbon, and is used in the production of steel.\n\nThe technology will be used on an industrial-scale for sponge iron production at SSAB’s facility in Gällivare, a few hours north of Luleå, within the next four years, Vattenfall said.\n\nThe pilot facility is 100 cubic metres in size and could be expanded to 100,000 to 120,000 cubic metres. This would equate to 100GWh of energy storage in green hydrogen form, which a press release said was enough to supply a full-size sponge iron factory for three to four days.\n\nLars Ydreskog, director of strategic projects at LKAB, said: “Hydrogen gas and its storage are central to our transition. In just four years, HYBRIT technology will be used for the production of fossil-free sponge iron on a large scale at a first demonstration facility in Gällivare. LKAB will become one of Europe’s biggest hydrogen producers, and this pilot project will provide valuable knowledge for the continuing work on creating the world’s first fossil-free value chain for the iron and steel industry.”\n\nVattenfall said the pilot facility in Luleå is the first in the world to test the technology with repeated filling and emptying of hydrogen gas.\n\nOther large cavern facilities for storing green hydrogen which are in development include ACES Delta in Utah, US, and the HyStock project in the Netherlands. ACES has a total storage capacity of 300GWh and is expected to come online in stages starting in 2025, while the 26 million kg-capacity HyStock is expected online the following year. ACES will supply gas to a combined cycle power plant while HyStock’s developers have been vague on its use cases.\n\nThe main use case for green hydrogen technology at scale is as a feedstock for various industrial processes to help them decarbonise, followed by replacing fossil fuel in transportation and the finally blending with natural gas for conventional gas power plants.\n\nStoring green hydrogen for conversion back to electricity – power-to-X-to-power – has a round-trip efficiency too low to be economical for now, most industry observers say.",

Credit: Niam.\n\nNorwegian real asset manager Niam , via its Niam Infra Fund, has partnered with solar developer Solkompaniet to develop a 500MW solar portfolio in southern Sweden.\n\nThe solar projects in the portfolio will have the capacity to power 120,000 households in central and southern Sweden.\n\nThey will require a total investment of more than €300m ($297.7m).\n\nSolkompaniet CEO Axel Alm said: “Solkompaniet has built solar parks since the start in 2010, but it is only now that the size of the parks means that they become an important part of our electricity supply.\n\n“The first solar park that we will develop and build for Niam alone corresponds to as much as has been built historically in Sweden until 2021.”\n\nNiam and Solkompaniet are currently developing two 80MW solar facilities under the framework agreement.\n\nOne of these is the Östra Eneby solar facility located outside Norrköping, which is said to be the most progressed among the two.\n\nThe Östra Eneby project is expected to come online by the end of 2024.\n\nThe two companies aim to start developing additional solar parks under the framework agreement over the next two years.\n\nNiam Infrastructure CEO Sverker Åkerblom said: “Sweden has great conditions for solar parks – plenty of land and good solar irradiation in our long coastal areas.\n\n“Niam wants to contribute to solar becoming an important part of the Swedish energy system.\n\n“Sweden’s electricity demand is predicted to double as a result of the electrification that is now taking place, and solar can relatively quickly meet part of the increased demand in southern Sweden, where there is significant near-term need.”\n\nNiam invests in real assets in the Nordic countries and northern Europe, focusing on real estate and infrastructure.\n\nThe company established the Niam Infra Fund last year.",
