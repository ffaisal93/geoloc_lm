Yuri Kochetkov/Pool via REUTERS\n\nBRUSSELS, Sept 26 (Reuters) - The EU on Monday denounced a decision by Serbia to hold foreign policy consultations with Russia, saying it raised questions at a time when Brussels has told countries seeking to join the bloc not to carry on with business as usual with Moscow.\n\nRussia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and his Serbian counterpart Nikola Selakovic signed a document on Friday dubbed a \"plan on consultations\".\n\nSelakovic said that the plan envisages consultations on bilateral and multilateral activities, though there was nothing on security policies in it.

A similar study has also began on the location of the Palace of Serbia.\n\nPreliminary results indicate that there is a geothermal resource in both locations with potential to supply power to the two buildings. This will then be followed by a Building Energy Rehabilitation Feasibility Study that will consider the scope, type, and manner of use of the geothermal resource. The planned geothermal resource research will be completed by November 2022.\n\nThese surveys are part of “Energy Efficiency in Central Government Buildings,” a EUR 40-million multi-year programme that aims to improve the energy efficiency in central government buildings. The geothermal resource research conducted at the Palace of Serbia was made possible owing to financial support from the West Balkans Investment Framework (WBIF) and CEB trust funds financed by the Slovak Republic and the Kingdom of Spain, while the same study at the SIV 3 building was financed from grants provided by the Government of the Slovak Republic via the UNDP fund.\n\nThe application of geothermal power to provide for some of the energy needs of SIV 3 and Palace of Serbia buildings would help reduce the buildings’ primary power consumption, cut down CO2 emissions, and enable energy-related savings that can be used to improve working conditions for the staff. It would also address the rising need for introducing newer and cleaner energy sources, and contribute to the green transition of the Serbian economy and society.\n\nSource: UNDP",

    "ILUS Confirms Its First Investment Project in Serbia": "NEW YORK, NY, Sept. 26, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NewMediaWire -- ILUS International Inc (OTC: ILUS) is a Mergers and Acquisitions company focused on acquiring and growing public safety and industrial companies across the globe. Following decisive meetings with the Development Agency of Serbia and City of Čačak Municipality, the subsidies for the first ILUS investment project in Serbia have been secured and the mobilization plan finalized.\n\n\n\n“Our city is proud to welcome ILUS International for a long-term partnership which is creating thousands of jobs over the next ten years and strengthening the economy in our region. We are pleased that such innovative products will be manufactured in our region by our local people and exported to all parts of the world,” said Mayor of Čačak, Milun Todorovic.\n\nFor its first investment project in Serbia, ILUS has secured upwards of $8 million in government subsidies for ILUS EV Technologies. A further five planned investment projects are included in the company’s approved Phase One business plan for the region, each resulting in their own substantial government subsidies.\n\nAs part of the planned Phase One rollout in Serbia, ILUS has secured a large site on the outskirts of Čačak and also has the option to secure manufacturing facilities in Kragujevac and Jagodina. The planned Phase Two project is considered by ILUS as a separate project entirely, involving the privatization of a large government site.\n\nILUS is now preparing for its machinery and equipment to arrive in Serbia. This will include setting up the production lines for E-Raptor commercial electric utility vehicle manufacturing and OEM manufacturing. Simultaneously, ILUS’ urban mining company, Replay Solutions, will be shipping its plant machinery to Serbia as part of another investment project which will be announced separately. This alone is a substantial undertaking as the list of heavy machinery includes a PCB (Printed Circuit Board) Crusher and Shredder, Electrostatic Separator, Airflow Separator, Pulse Dust Collector, Chemical Refining equipment and Copper Wire Recycling System. Serbia is also expected to be ILUS’ main production hub for vehicles and equipment outside of the United States. The planned investment projects are expected to boost the economy of the region and provide significant revenue for the ILUS subsidiaries, whilst creating employment for hundreds of Serbians over the next three years and thousands over the next five to ten years.\n\n“We are pleased to confirm commencement of our first of several projects in Serbia, whereby we have secured extraordinary benefits to boost our global manufacturing capability. Indeed, further sites are being discussed with the Serbian government and huge contracts are being negotiated for our subsidiaries in Southern and Eastern Europe, such as the Serbian governments need to replace more than 300 firefighting vehicles so that they meet EURO 6 emissions regulations. Our mobilization in Serbia forms part of our greater conglomerate plan to control large scale manufacturing capability in the United States, Europe, and the Middle East,” said ILUS Managing Director, John-Paul Backwell.\n\nThe Serbian city of Čačak is widely regarded as a European innovation hub and was originally chosen by ILUS for its first phase of European production because of its support for manufacturing companies as well as its excellent geographic position with efficient connection to the rest of Europe. Serbia has an attractive automotive and industrial manufacturing industry with highly regarded free zones and government incentives. Many of the world’s largest vehicle brands and automotive industry suppliers have manufacturing facilities in Serbia. Serbia’s low construction, labour, and energy costs compared with other European countries, combined with its pan-European highway network, has led many global conglomerates to have major operations in the country.\n\n“We have formed a favourable and long-term partnership with the Serbian government which gives us the large-scale manufacturing capability that we require for our existing operating companies and for our planned acquisitions which range across the emergency response, defense, and renewable energy sectors. This is only the first project with much larger deals on the horizon in the region. I am proud of what our team has achieved and what this means for the ILUS conglomerate we are building,” said ILUS CEO, Nick Link.\n\nFor further information on the companies please see the ILUS communication channels.\n\nWebsite: https://ilus-group.com\n\nTwitter: ILUS_INTL\n\nEmail: IR@Ilus-Group.com\n\nSource: ILUS\n\nRelated Links\n\nhttps://ilus-group.com\n\nForward-Looking Statement\n\nCertain information set forth in this press release contains \"forward-looking information\", including \"future-oriented financial information\" and \"financial outlook\", under applicable securities laws (collectively referred to herein as forward-looking statements).

    "Serbia: Prospect of EU membership in exchange for giving up Kosovo?": "Long-stalled Serbia–Kosovo dialogue, sponsored by the EU, could be unblocked next year if claims that there is a new EU plan, published in some regional media, are officially confirmed.\n\nTalks on normalising relations between the two countries remain stagnant, and out of the handful of agreements signed, even less have been implemented. Over 11 years of talks, the recognition of Kosovo by Serbia has never been on the table.\n\nKosovo website, Albanian Post, reported that a new plan had been drafted on normalising relations after the engagement of German and French envoys.\n\nAccording to the website, the plan envisages Belgrade accepting, without formally recognising, Kosovo’s independence, getting some financial benefits and the prospect of EU membership in return.\n\nThe same source said that in 10 years when the next batch of EU candidates are likely to join the union, a formal agreement on mutual recognition would be reached and activated before the whole region ascends.\n\nThat would entail recognition of Kosovo’s independence by the five EU countries that have not done so (Greece, Slovakia, Spain, Romania, and Cyprus), while Serbia would get “huge financial aid” and be recognised as the “leading power in the region”.\n\nWhile the plan’s authenticity remains officially unconfirmed, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic recently said he has “read this paper but, knowing what was going to happen, refused to receive it” from the EU special envoy for the dialogue, Miroslav Lajcak, as he visited Belgrade.\n\n“I am experienced enough to know I was not to take that paper.”\n\nDuring a debate on Kosovo in the Serbian parliament, Vucic said that during his term in office, i.e. in the next four and a half years, the former Serbian province that declared independence in 2008 would not be recognised, nor would it join the U.N.\n\nSeveral days later, at the promotion of the youngest generation of Serbian Armed Forces officers in downtown Belgrade, Vucic said that “we will not give Kosovo or any other span of our fatherland to anyone.”\n\n“Those who are threatening Serbia have never understood how great our resolve and determination is to guard what is ours,” said Vucic, without specifying who was threatening Belgrade and why he felt the need to reiterate that it would not relinquish Kosovo.\n\nWhat also piqued public curiosity was that in a patriotic song performed during a break in the programme, the lyric about Kosovo as “the soul of Serbia” was replaced with the line “to all the heroes of Serbia”.\n\nThe song’s author said the Kosovo bit was removed at the request of the Ministry of Defence, which the ministry later denied, saying there were different versions of the same song.\n\nThe plan – a consequence of EU’s more intense engagement\n\nAlbanian Post wrote that the plan is “a new framework” stemming from the direct involvement of French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in the dialogue after the EU leadership apparently concluded that “Kosovo and Serbia will never be able to solve the problem on their own”.\n\nTo soften the blow – as Kosovo remains a highly sensitive issue in Serbia – in the first decade of the agreement’s implementation, Belgrade would not have to recognise it but just accept independence.\n\nThat would be enough for the plan’s authors, given that the issue of Serbia’s accession to the EU will not be on the agenda for some time.\n\nHowever, this would entail Belgrade having to refrain from lobbying for the derecognition of Kosovo’s independence, as well as from opposing Pristina’s accession to international organisations.\n\nThat would enable Kosovo to join the Council of Europe, in the second phase, Interpol and UNESCO, then NATO and the EU, and finally the United Nations.\n\nThat UN membership would apparently be the most problematic because it does not depend solely on Belgrade but also on the position of Russia, as Moscow continues to express readiness to veto any such initiative.\n\nFor its part, Pristina would agree to enable forming the Association of Serb Municipalities at the end of the 10-year period, right before mutual recognition. The association would see the creation of a Serb structure in Kosovo, backed by Belgrade, something Pristina says goes against its constitution and has failed elsewhere, i.e. Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nThe plan allegedly also envisages a precise sequence of events in case Belgrade or Pristina do not accept the document, but those details have not been published.\n\nNo clear confirmation of the document’s authenticity\n\nAlthough nearly all the parties mentioned in the article, aside from Pristina, have commented on the alleged document, its authenticity has never been confirmed or denied.\n\nMedia in Pristina, however, say that Kosovo journalist Baton Haxhiu, known for his close ties with Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama, is behind the article and the website. That is why the document is believed to be authentic.\n\nThe EU has declined to comment on the document, but political pundits have noticed that neither the document’s content nor authenticity has been denied.\n\nThe EU spokesman for foreign affairs and security policy, Peter Stano, has said that as a rule, the EU does not comment on alleged documents published by the media.\n\nAsked about the alleged document, US Ambassador to Serbia Christopher Hill said his country backed the EU in its efforts to achieve a solution in the Belgrade–Pristina dialogue because that problem had been going on for too long and had to be solved.\n\nAnalysts without a clear position on options for implementing the supposed plan\n\nThere is no consensus among political analysts on both sides as to whether the document is authentic but even less so on whether its implementation is feasible, even though they all agree that for the first time in many years, there is a certain readiness in the international community to get the ball rolling.\n\nBelgrade-based political analyst Dusan Janjic believes there are multiple documents in circulation. Vucic said that the West was preparing “a new reinforcement” for Kosovo precisely because he had seen one of those papers.\n\n“The US is insisting on a new format, and this document definitely exists. The timing mentioned in that document completely fits the methodology of operation of the US administration,” said Janjic.\n\nHe said that if the document were not accepted and should the conflict continue, Washington would apply “plan B”, which entailed conflict management and destabilisation controlled by the US, after which Washington would impose a solution on both parties.\n\nFormer Serbian Minister for Kosovo, Slobodan Samardzic, said the published document is not a working platform for a solution but rather a means of ramping up pressure on Belgrade.\n\n“This is pressure based on a paper. This is a new phase on the same subject. There is nothing new, but what will happen if that story continues is new,” said Samardzic.\n\nOn the other hand, Kosovo’s former deputy foreign minister, Valon Murtezaj, believes the plan stands a slim chance of success because of, as he put it, “the destructiveness of Serbia,” which he considers “an unreliable party.”\n\nAccording to him, one should not wait an entire decade for Kosovo’s recognition because Belgrade would use that period to lobby against Kosovo abroad.\n\nFormer Kosovo diplomat Lulzim Peci found some provisions of the supposed plan highly controversial and suspicious, particularly the suggestion that Serbia would be acknowledged as the political and economic leader.\n\n“That terminology does not exist in contemporary legal acts because it entails the legalisation of hegemony and violation of the principle of international law of the equality of states… It looks more like a text for pleasing the sick egos of regional leaders who think they can become masters in others’ homes,” said Peci.\n\nPerhaps the story’s most mysterious segment is Pristina’s behaviour, which has stayed completely silent on the subject. However, Prime Minister Albin Kurti is known as an advocate of Kosovo’s instant recognition as a condition for any talks with Belgrade.\n\nAnalysts believe this might indicate that the international community has sent him a signal that this is a serious plan and that it would not be politically wise for him to reject it even if it does not entirely suit him.\n\n[Edited by Zoran Radosavljevic/Alice Taylor]",
    "EU, US Question Serbia’s EU Commitment After Russia Deal": "By: Associated Press\n\n-\n\nThe European Union and the U.S. on Monday questioned Serbia’s proclaimed commitment to join Europe’s 27-nation bloc after Belgrade signed an agreement with Moscow pledging long-term “consultations” on foreign policy matters amid Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\nSerbia’s officials signed the deal last week in New York with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, where most Western delegations shunned Russia’s top diplomat over the country’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nUnder the 10-year rule of Serbian populist President Aleksandar Vucic, a former ultranationalist, Serbia has been steadily sliding away from its proclaimed EU goals and establishing close political ties with Russia.\n\nSerbia’s foreign ministry has sought to downplay the importance of the signed agreement, saying it’s a “technical” one and relates to bilateral ties and not security issues.\n\nAlthough Serbia said it supports Ukraine’s territorial integrity, its right-wing government has repeatedly refused to join Western sanctions against Slavic ally Russia. Aligning foreign policies with the EU is one of the main preconditions for joining the 27-nation bloc, but Serbia has increasingly defied calls to do so.\n\n﻿The news of the deal triggered harsh criticism from both EU and U.S. officials.\n\nEuropean Commission spokesman Peter Stano warned on Monday that Serbia’s relations with Russia can’t be “business as usual” when Moscow is violating the U.N. Charter with its armed forces committing atrocities in Ukraine.\n\n“It’s a very clear sign of their intention to strengthen their ties, to further strengthen relations between Serbia and Russia and this is raising serious questions,” he said. “We are taking this very seriously and we are following this up.”\n\nU.S. Ambassador Christopher R. Hill said “further alignment with Russia is a step in the wrong direction and contrary to Serbia’s stated European aspirations.”\n\n“The United States believes that no country should be expanding cooperation with Russia while it continues its war of aggression against Ukraine,” Hill said in a statement to The Associated Press. “News of this agreement signed with Russia was surprising and stands in stark contrast with other constructive meetings in New York with Serbian officials.”\n\n\n\n",
    "Serbia's Conservatives Seek Textbook Ban Over 'LGBT Ideology'": "BELGRADE -- Staunch religious and political conservatives have teamed up to challenge Serbia's recently revamped school curriculum over descriptions of gender and sexual identity, sparking a formal review that could result in a textbook ban.\n\nFrom biology to history and sociology, the Serbian Orthodox Church and a fringe right-wing party have demanded the replacement of textbooks they say \"promote LGBT ideology.\"\n\nAs a result, Serbia's education minister is awaiting a recommendation from the National Education Council on the scientific soundness of the materials but also on whether it serves the \"national interest\" to present such ideas to schoolchildren.\n\nEducators and members of Serbia's beleaguered lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community warn that it's part of an accelerating trend of official surrender to the clergy and nationalists seeking to censor and \"dehumanize\" entire segments of the population.\n\nMoreover, they question what \"LGBT ideology\" even means. \"They want to dehumanize us with that phrase,\" Ana Petrovic, a queer woman who lives in Belgrade, told RFE/RL's Balkan Service.\n\n\"It's loud right-wing propaganda that causes us great harm and behind which there's no genuine argument hidden,\" said Petrovic, who works for the Da Se Zna NGO, which provides psychological and legal support to the LGBT community. \"In reality, we are how we are, and we're citizens of this country.\"\n\nOther critics say the textbook challenge is part of a battle to preserve a church-state divide in the face of an \"increasingly extensive clericalization\" that threatens to leave whole generations ill-prepared for life in a rapidly changing world.\n\n'Not Propagated By God'\n\nThe textbook controversy gained steam as Serbian opposition arose this summer to an international parade to express LGBT pride that was scheduled to take place in Belgrade as part of EuroPride week on September 12-18.\n\nOn September 11, with members of his clergy in lockstep with the anti-Pride protests, Serbian Orthodox Patriarch Porfirije appealed publicly for the withdrawal of an eighth-grade biology textbook.\n\nHe said the book, introduced a year earlier under sweeping curricular reforms mandated in 2017, \"imposes an unacceptable LGBT ideology.\" Porfirije said Orthodox Christians \"cannot accept the imposition of new social norms that were not propagated by God.\"\n\nA week later, the leader of a right-wing party rooted in Christianity and nationalism that returned to parliament in April thanks in part to a coalition with monarchists, expanded the complaint, adding seven other textbooks approved by the Education Ministry for primary- and secondary-school students.\n\nDoors party leader Bosko Obradovic cited \"controversial LGBT content\" in five biology textbooks for eighth-graders, an eighth-grade history book, a fourth-grade sociology textbook, and a high-school manual on civic education.\n\nHe alleged that \"the LGBT movement is trying to impose its ideology on the education system, even though that ideology is completely unscientific and unconstitutional.\"\n\nMoreover, Obradovic said, its efforts were targeting students \"in the most sensitive period of maturation.\"\n\nHe requested an urgent session of parliament's Education Committee and pledged to introduce legislation banning \"promotion of homosexual propaganda and transgenderism to minors.\"\n\nOne of the biology textbooks in question explains the difference between sex and gender, and describes sexual orientation and gender identity. Gender \"can be independent of the sex assigned to [a person] at birth,\" the book says, adding, \"An individual alone can determine [their] gender identity.\"\n\nThe history textbook describes LGBT social movements as activists seeking the improvement of the situation for LGBT individuals \"who are often socially exposed to widespread discrimination.\"\n\nWhose 'National Interest'?\n\nEducation Minister Branko Ruzic responded to Porfirije's initiative by citing \"public controversy\" to order a new assessment of the syllabus involving the eighth-grade biology textbook.\n\nHe tasked the National Education Council with evaluating \"whether the program is in accordance with scientific theories\" and \"whether the national interest is reflected in them, and whether this is in the best interest of education\" for Serbia's children.\n\nThe council is currently seeking expert opinion ahead of an extraordinary session to agree on nonbinding conclusions for the minister.\n\nRuzic unfortunately \"succumbed to the influence of those who should not question the curriculum, especially when it comes to natural, exact sciences that are based on data and research,\" Biljana Stojkovic, a professor of biology at the University of Belgrade who participated in the development of the new biology curriculum, told RFE/RL's Balkan Service.\n\nShe says the syllabus sticks to facts and that \"national interest\" has no place in scientific education since there's no \"Serbian biology, physics, or chemistry.\"\n\nStojkovic, who was a presidential candidate for a green coalition in this year's presidential election won by incumbent Aleksandar Vucic and has publicly opposed religion in public education, says she regards the attacks on the syllabus as \"censorship.\"\n\nForcing biology teachers \"not to talk about what scientific knowledge is...will be met with great resistance from the biological profession,\" she said.\n\nSerbia's 2018 law on textbooks prescribes that textbook publishers present a curriculum adopted by the education minister. The curriculum is recommended by the National Education Council based on a proposal from the Institute for the Improvement of Education, which operates under the ministry.\n\nThe curriculums and textbooks currently under attack by conservatives were introduced ahead of the 2021-22 academic year.\n\nThe Education Ministry declined to respond to RFE/RL queries on the textbook issue.\n\nThe Institute for the Improvement of Education told RFE/RL's Balkan Service that the curriculum it proposed in 2019 was in line with accepted theories and facts, as well as with the legislatively mandated goals of education. There were no problems in the approval process for the related textbooks and the biology textbook in question has been in use for a year, the institute added.\n\n\"It wasn't done 'overnight,' it was a team of experts\" who created the curriculum, Stojkovic said. \"Schoolteachers were involved, too. The plan and program were fundamentally changed with the aim of modernizing them so you can apply the knowledge from biology in understanding the world around you.\"\n\nShe blamed the current criticisms on \"retrograde structures whose goal is to hide this scientific knowledge\" and \"deny children the knowledge that certain minority groups exist in our society at all.\"\n\nBowing to the calls for banning the textbooks would be tantamount to \"the capitulation of the state to increasingly strong clerical and nationalist currents,\" she said.\n\n'Used To It Since We Were Little'\n\nCritics, including the European Parliament, earlier this year expressed alarm over perceived Serbian concessions to Orthodox Church efforts emanating from Moscow to portray Russia as a guardian of traditional family values in the Balkans, thus strengthening ties there as Moscow faces increased isolation over its ongoing invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn a resolution warning of \"foreign interference\" in EU democratic processes in March, European lawmakers expressed concern about alleged \"attempts by the Orthodox Church in countries such as Serbia, Montenegro, and Bosnia-Herzegovina, especially in its entity Republika Srpska, to promote Russia as a protector of traditional family values and fortify relations between state and church.\"\n\nAround 85 percent of Serbia's population described itself as Christian Orthodox in the country's last census, in 2011.\n\nPresident Vucic has done little to discourage the Serbian Orthodox Church's frequent forays into politics at home and in neighboring Montenegro and Bosnia. He has maintained close ties to Moscow and endorsed a \"Slavic brotherhood\" uniting Russians and Serbs throughout the region.\n\nIn an online Appeal For A Secular State, published on September 19, 200 prominent Serbs called for official pushback against an \"increasingly extensive clericalization of the state.\"\n\nOrganized by longtime opposition leader Zoran Vuletic and his liberal Civic Democratic Forum (GDF) party, it blames the imposition of religious notions in education for the spread of \"denial of science, conspiracy theories, and mythomania\" that risks \"raising whole generations in the spirit of the most conservative obscurantism, unable to live in the modern world and keep pace with their surroundings.\"\n\nThere are also fears that a Serbian ban on the teaching of issues around sexual orientation, gender identity, and LGBT activism could foreshadow prohibitions on gay \"propaganda\" like those introduced in Russia nearly a decade ago and in Hungary last year. Lawmakers in Romania are currently considering similar legislation.\n\nSerbia's record on LGBT rights is mixed, at best, in a region where protections for sexual or gender minorities lag well behind the European Union.\n\nDiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in areas like employment, trade, and education is prohibited in Serbia. Same-sex marriage was banned by a constitutional amendment in 2006 that defined a marriage as between a consenting \"man and woman.\"\n\nSubsequent bills to grant health care, property, and other rights to same-sex partners have all stalled despite international pressure.\n\nSerbian NGOs record dozens of incidents of anti-LGBT violence every year.\n\nLast week's European-wide celebration of LGBT pride in Belgrade marked the first time in EuroPride's two-decade history that it's come to the Balkans.\n\nPressured by some of the same groups that are behind the textbooks initiative, Serbian officials allowed many of the week's events to go ahead but banned the culminating EuroPride parade on September 17 over fears of violence.\n\nThousands of LGBT supporters marched anyway, outnumbered by police deployed to protect them from counterdemonstrators, including right-wing thugs and church leaders.\n\nUros Tanackovic, who worked as a EuroPride volunteer, told RFE/RL's Balkan Service that it was a chance for LGBT people to \"come out one day a year and be who they are.\"\n\n\"Don't even ask gay people in Serbia if they've ever felt discriminated against -- we feel it every day,\" he said. \"We've been used to it since we were little.\"\n\nWritten by Andy Heil based on reporting by Nevena Bogdanovic of RFE/RL's Balkan Service in Belgrade",
    "Putin is banking on his friends in the Balkans to help sustain his bloody war in Ukraine | Michael Colborne": "I work at the investigative journalism website Bellingcat, where I lead our project using open-source research methods to monitor the far right across central and eastern Europe. In the Balkans, we’re seeing how Serbia’s far-right fringes are bolstering Russia’s bloody invasion of Ukraine. These groups aren’t just helping fan the flames in support of Russia’s war; they’re also receiving Russian help to push their own dangerous agenda in an already fractious part of Europe.\n\nAs Russia’s war in Ukraine drags on, the Kremlin has some of the most disruptive and dangerous far-right forces in the Balkans on its side. In April 2022, thousands of Serbs took to the streets of Belgrade to protest against their government’s support for the suspension of Russia from the United Nations Human rights council because of its invasion of Ukraine. At the rally, marchers waved Russian and Serbian flags and chanted slogans such as: “Serbs and Russians – brothers for ever!”\n\nThe protest in the Serbian capital was organised by the far-right group People’s Patrol and its leader, Damnjan Knežević, who has also organised several other pro-Russian rallies. Just a few weeks later, Knežević and another People’s Patrol leader travelled from Serbia to Russia. They spent a week there, at the invitation of several Russian media organisations – including one headed by the notorious Putin associate Yevgeny Prigozhin.\n\nMany Serbs believe Russia has long acted as a protector of Serbia and its interests; the two countries share Slavic roots, and people in both Russia and Serbia feel they have been demonised by the west. Knežević has claimed that Russia, along with Serbia in the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s, has been unfairly framed as an aggressor when they are merely trying to protect their ethnic brethren. Knežević and his friends have flooded social media with pro-Russian exhortations. They have painted themselves as the most committed defenders of Serbs from all manner of perceived outside threats. This extends to defending those who, they feel, also defend the Serbian people; it’s why one regional analyst stated that Serbia’s far right provides “the most constant and intensive support” for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThis support involves more than just words or rallies. In May of this year, the small neo-fascist group Serbian Action posted a video to their YouTube channel documenting a visit they had made several months before to St Petersburg. Several Serbian Action members travelled there at the invitation of the Russian Imperial Movement (RIM), which has been officially designated a terrorist group in the United States and Canada. In the video, the RIM leader, Denis Gariev, fires off a handgun and brags that he teaches almost 1,000 Russians a year at the movement’s training centre.\n\nThe day after Serbian Action posted that video, Knežević appeared at a press conference in St Petersburg. He was accompanied by Aleksandr Lysov, the head of a “Serbian-Russian cultural information centre” accused of threatening anti-Putin Russians living in Serbia, as well as an activist from the Young Guard, the youth wing of Putin’s political party, United Russia.\n\nWhat interested me wasn’t so much what Knežević said at this press conference, but where it was taking place – the press centre of Patriot Media Group, a media conglomerate whose board of trustees is headed by Prigozhin. Patriot Media Group was one of the three media organisations People’s Patrol claimed invited them to Russia (the others included the infamous Russian state media outlet RT – for whom Knežević did a studio interview – and the pro-Kremlin tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda).\n\nPrigozhin is a man we at Bellingcat unfortunately know all too well. He is an ex-convict and Putin confidant subject to US sanctions and wanted by the FBI for his alleged role in Russian interference in the 2016 elections. He has earned billions of dollars from Russian state contracts and allegedly controls Wagner, the private military company linked to numerous alleged war crimes in Africa and Ukraine.\n\nIt would be a mistake to ignore the relationships between the Serbian far right and Russia as meaningless or unworthy of further attention. Human rights organisations warned earlier this year that far-right extremism in Serbia is on the rise; EuroPride, the international LGBT event scheduled to run in Belgrade this month, faced a series of violent threats from the far right and the Serbian president, Aleksandar Vučić, announced it would be cancelled. Neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina, where nationalist tensions threaten to tear the country apart, has elections in October.\n\nMontenegro, which separated from Serbia in 2006, could soon also have new elections. The country continues to be plagued by disputes over its national identity, between more independence-minded Montenegrins and self-identified Serbs who want closer relations with neighbouring Serbia. Tensions with Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008 and is home to a small Serb minority, remain the biggest flash point in the region. The timing, unfortunately, is just right for Serbia’s far right to cause trouble if it wants to – and they have friends in Russia to give them a helping hand.\n\nAnd Russia has already started to help. An English-language documentary recently broadcast on RT gave a platform to Knežević and other Serbian far-right figures to express their views unchallenged. “Just as Russia is freeing the Russian world via denazification and demilitarisation,” says Miša Vacić, a far-right figure long alleged to be linked to Vučić and his governing Serbian Progressive party, “we Serbs also have the right, through special operations, to create our own Serbian world.”\n\nWe ignore the far right in the Balkans at our peril. Their ideologies are based on the same resentments and grievances that caused the Yugoslav disintegration wars of the 1990s, but they’ve now found more people around the world, including Russia, willing to encourage and support them. It wouldn’t be the first time – the US state department claimed in a recently declassified cable that Russia has spent $300m since 2014 to try to influence politicians and others around the world, including in the Balkans. Russia may not have started this fire, but it’s more than happy to help stoke it.",

    "Serbian president questions double standards over territorial integrity": "Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic on Wednesday questioned double standards practiced by certain countries over the territorial integrity and sovereignty of states.\n\n\n\nNonuse of force and the peaceful resolution of disputes are the pillars of world stability. But they must be accompanied by principles such as nonselective observance of the UN Charter, implementation of mandatory UN Security Council resolutions and the basic principles of the applicable international law, he told the General Debate of the 77th session of the UN General Assembly.\n\n\n\nSerbia did not violate the territorial integrity of a single sovereign state. Yet, the fact did not prevent NATO from attacking Serbia without a decision by the UN Security Council, Vucic said.\n\n\n\nSecurity Council Resolution 1244, which confirmed and guaranteed partial sovereignty and full territorial integrity of Serbia, did not prevent many Western countries from unilaterally recognizing the independence of Kosovo, and from violating the territorial integrity of Serbia, he said.\n\n\n\nRegardless of the fact that Serbia still feels the consequences of the gross violation of the basic provisions of international law, Serbia does not give up on the foundational principles of the UN, said Vucic.\n\n\n\n\"We shall keep advocating the consistent observance of the principle of inviolability of borders, respect for sovereignty and integrity of all other UN member states,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"Despite such a position of ours, many in this room have issues with respecting the territorial integrity of Serbia. You wonder why? Because they have the power in their hands, and in their eyes, we are small and weak.\"\n\n\n\nSerbia believes that it is imperative that current challenges must not deepen world divisions in any way, and that polarization at the global level should make room for principles of multilateralism, he said.\n\n\n\nSerbia strongly supports inclusive, networked and efficient multilateralism as the best tool for responding to the most urgent challenges facing mankind, he said. \"Multilateralism, collective actions and common responsibility are ­irreplaceable elements of our discussions so far. But allow me to underline that the starting point for such constructive engagement is solidarity,\" Vucic said.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "Serbia Claims Third Title At Men’s U19 European Water Polo Championships": "Courtesy: LEN\n\nAfter back-to-back penalty shootout wins in the quarters (vs Italy) and the semis (vs Hungary), Serbia clinched the title in regular time against Spain. The final was no less thrilling as their previous encounters, the decisive goal came two minutes from time while the Serbs killed four man-downs in the last five minutes. It’s a painful loss for the Spaniards – while this was the Serbs’ third title in the last four editions, Spain had to settle for the silver for the 6th time since the inaugural 1970 championship (and yet to finish first). The bronze went to Hungary which managed to beat Greece convincingly.\n\nFinal: Serbia v Spain 9-8. Bronze medal: Hungary v Greece 10-7. For places 5-6th: Italy v Croatia 11-14. For places 7-8th: Germany v Montenegro 12-13.\n\nFinal rankings: 1. Serbia, 2. Spain, 3. Hungary, 4. Greece, 5. Croatia, 6. Italy, 7. Montenegro, 8. Germany, 9. Netherlands, 10. Malta, 11. France, 12. Georgia, 13. Turkiye, 14. Romania, 15. Czech Republic, 16. Slovakia.\n\nSerbia ‘finally’ won a game in the regular time – and that landed them the title. They got back to the throne they had occupied in 2014 and 2016, after missing the podium in 2018 (the 2020 edition was cancelled). The Serbs’ last three matches in the knockout phase were all thrillers, they ousted Italy in a shootout in the quarters, beat Hungary again with penalties in the semis, then nailed against Spain, scoring the winner two minutes from time.\n\nIn the final, Spain took the lead and Serbs needed almost six minutes to score their first but then added one more to go ahead 2-1 after eight minutes. Soon they doubled the gap and still held on for 4-2 deep into the third but the Spaniards levelled the score in 47 seconds while the Serbs’ captain Vasilije Martinovic got his second exclusion. Still, his team-mates didn’t panic, and Nikola Kojic netted an action goal in the very last second of the first half for 5-4.\n\nAgain, the Serbs managed to reset the two-goal difference twice, however, Spain could come back to even again, two man-up goals in two minutes were enough to make it 7-7, while the Serbs missed two extras still in this period.\n\nNot in the fourth, though, Aleksandar Kovacevic put away a 6 on 5 after a minute, however, despite missing their next man-up, Spain could equalise, Gerard Gil sent the ball home from action for 8-8. With 5:23 to go, Serbia took a time-out, but the man-up play didn’t work; still, a save also denied the Spaniards in their extra. A bit later, with 3:24 on the clock, the Serbian head coach Uros Stevanovic got a red card (not for the first time in his career, though his impulsiveness is definitely one of the keys to his teams’ successes) – that just boosted his players’ morale who killed back-to-back man-downs and then Martinovic, still in the water, sent a brilliant bouncer from the wing under the bar in an extra, with 2:03 on the clock for 9-8.\n\n𝗟𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝗻𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 🤩🇷🇸 The future of Serbian Water Polo 👏 #ecwppodgorica2022 pic.twitter.com/hUzw4lz6kv — LEN – European Aquatics (@LENaquatics) September 26, 2022\n\nIt was Spain’s turn, but even after a time-out they were unable to overplay the super-intensive defence of the Serbs and the goalie could make an easy catch to deny them in the fourth straight man-down. The Spaniards had one more possession, managed to launch a counter-like attack but the finish was poor from the left side, and together with the ball their chances also flew away.\n\nThe Serbs kept the ball in the last half a minute and could start the big celebrations together with many supporters coming over to the neighbourhood – they claimed their 4th title (as Serbia), while Spain had to settle for the silver medal for the 6th time.\n\n𝗦𝗲𝗿𝗯𝗶𝗮 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗱𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗶𝘁! 🔥 🇷🇸 Serbia win #ecwppodgorica2022 gold after victory over Spain! pic.twitter.com/saQ4LkqjI0 — LEN – European Aquatics (@LENaquatics) September 25, 2022\n\nIn the bronze medal match, Hungary earned some consolation with a hard-fought win over Greece. The Magyars took a 2-1 lead after eight minutes, the Greeks hit back with three connecting goals early in the second to go 2-4 up. Then came a crucial phase as the Hungarians regrouped themselves and after coming back to even by half-time, they added three more in the third to stage a 6-1 run. After falling back to 8-5, the Greeks had desperate attempts but were unable to cut the gap to one goal at any stage. With 59 seconds to go, Erik Molnar – silver medallist with the senior team two weeks ago in Split – put away an extra to close down the contest.\n\n🇭🇺 Hungary beat Greece to secure bronze at #ecwppodgorica2022. pic.twitter.com/lsDIXxoeoM — LEN – European Aquatics (@LENaquatics) September 25, 2022\n\nCroatia built a massive lead in the second period of the game played for the fifth place, and once they were 4-8 up, they never let the Italians back to the match.

    "Serbia bans its first staging of EuroPride rally at late notice": "Serbian authorities have banned EuroPride, the pan-European gathering of the LGBTQ community due to be held in Belgrade on Saturday, sparking an outcry from organisers.\n\nEuroPride is held in a different country every year, and this would have been Serbia’s first time hosting the event.\n\n“The Serbian police banned this year’s EuroPride march by handing over the official notice to the organisers,” Belgrade Pride said. “Belgrade Pride will use all available legal means to overturn this decision.”\n\nThe interior ministry confirmed that the EuroPride march had been forbidden, as had a counter-protest on the same day. “Senseless conflicts on the streets of Belgrade would … endanger the safety of the participants of the march, as well as other citizens,” said the interior minister, Aleksandar Vulin.\n\nTensions have been mounting in Belgrade since the Serbian president, Aleksandar Vučić, called for the cancellation of the event late last month. He cited reasons including recent tensions with the former breakaway province of Kosovo and concerns over energy and food.\n\nGoran Miletic, one of the event’s organisers, said the demonstration would go ahead despite the ban. “We will certainly get together and walk as planned,” Miletic said.\n\nGay marriage is not legally recognised in Serbia, where homophobia remains deep-seated despite incremental strides over the years in reducing discrimination.\n\nBelgrade Pride marches in 2001 and 2010 were marred by violence and rioting after far-right groups targeted the events. Since 2014, the parade has been organised regularly but protected with a large law enforcement presence.\n\nOn Sunday, thousands of people took part in an anti-pride demonstration in Belgrade, with biker gangs, Orthodox priests and far-right nationalists demanding the EuroPride rally be forbidden.",

But again, our main strategy is to target cities that have year-round potential. We do not want to increase seasonality, which is already high in our region. That's one of the reasons we favour Chicago over Toronto, for example, because the Canadian city is not only extremely seasonal, but also extremely unidirectional. At the beginning of the season the flights are full in one direction, and at the end of the season in the other direction.\"\n\nThe busiest unserved United States routes from Belgrade, excluding Chicago, are Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Las Vegas, Denver, Phoenix, Detroit, Atlanta, Boston, Washington, Tampa, Houston, and Orlando.\n\nAir Serbia owes a lot of its success to the Serbian government which subsidizes and owns much of the airline. Photo: Air Serbia\n\nThe Serbian carrier already plans to have daily service to New York next summer in addition to two weekly frequencies to Chicago and hopes to agree to a codeshare with a major United States airline. Air Serbia has previously attempted to form a codeshare agreement with American carriers but was unsuccessful.\n\n“We currently have interline agreements that work quite well. But we are working on reaching the next level, which is codeshare cooperation with one of the major airlines in the United States. We are in the final stages of negotiations and believe we can announce this before the end of the year.” - Marek\n\nRecent Air Serbia news\n\nEarly this week, Air Serbia announced that it was counting on 2022 to be a profitable year. Newly appointed CEO Jiri Marek said,\n\n“We are a smaller regional airline and want to grow with the market in a profitable and sustainable way. In 2021 we significantly improved our operational performance and even reduced our loss. This year we are aiming to be profitable, and we will continue to be on that path in the future as well. We want it to stay like that. Air Serbia will continue to be the leading regional carrier in the Balkan region, and we would like to keep our market share between 50 to 55 percent in Belgrade.”\n\nBefore 2020, Air Serbia recorded profits every year from 2014-2020. But had it not been for government subsidies, Air Serbia would have suffered significant losses. The value of the airline's subsidies is unknown, as well as the subsidies offered by the government to over 50 organizations.\n\nEtihad used to have an ownership stake in Air Serbia, but it recently withdrew. Photo: Air Serbia\n\nLess than two years ago, Air Serbia received a capital injection of $100 million, but how the money was used is unknown. The injection increased the Government’s stake in the airline from 51% to 82%, which happened as Etihad withdrew from Air Serbia. As the Serbian government and Air Serbia are tightly linked, Air Serbia has been able to grow significantly. Marek added,\n\n“Air Serbia played a significant role during the pandemic, helping the Serbian government with repatriation flights, with delivering medical aid and so on. And I think we proved that not only connectivity but also significant economic benefits are a result of our operation.”\n\nThe Serbian airline hopes that this year’s return to profit will begin a trend of long-term profitability.\n\nDo you think that Air Serbia will be able to reach a codeshare with an American carrier anytime soon?

    "Proxy war between East and West in Serbia, President Vucic says": "Serbia wants to join the European Union while keeping strong relations with its gas supplier Russia and key investor China.\n\nThe East and West are engaged in a proxy war in Serbia, President Aleksandar Vucic has said, as Belgrade seeks to maintain its ambition to join the EU while keeping its relations with Russia and China.\n\nVucic’s remarks on Monday come a day after protesters at a rally in Belgrade against a gay pride march waved Russian flags and carried posters of Russia’s President Vladimir Putin.\n\n“I cannot say that it [the protest] was a proxy attack because there were many ordinary people there … But whether there is a proxy conflict in Serbia … there is one, no doubt about that, East and West,” he said.\n\nSerbia has been a candidate to join its single-biggest trade partner and investor, the European Union, since 2012. It is militarily neutral but maintains ties with NATO and has purchased weapons from its member states.\n\nHowever, the Balkan nation is almost entirely dependent on Russian gas and has also bought weapons from Russia. China is a key investor, mainly in mining and infrastructure.\n\nAlthough Serbia condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine at the United Nations, it refused to join sanctions against Moscow.

They handed out a jaw-dropping All-Time Women's World Cup record 41 assists for 41 field-goals made to suggest they are intent on chasing down one of the top two spots in Group A.Yuan Li led with 9 assists, while Siyu Wang handed out 8 dimes as they set a new All-Time record.\n\nLast Eight For Les Bleues as Japan miss out\n\n\n\nFrance are celebrating making the Quarter-Finals after they completed an impressive 67-53 success against Japan, who's participation in the tournament beyond the group phase is now over. Iliana Rupert came up big with a nice double-double for France with 15 points and 12 rebounds.\n\nUSA's scoring frenzy sees records tumble\n\n\n\nUSA posted a landmark day as they set a new All-Time record for the most points in a game after beating Korea 145-69. Brionna Jones and A'Ja Wilson were unstoppable and went for 24 and 20 points respectively, making a combined and mind-blowing 22 of 25 from the field.\n\nQuarter-Finals bound Cats gunning for a 2018 repeat!\n\n\n\nFour years after they debuted in Tenerife and made a run to the Semi-Finals, Belgium find themselves in the last eight again. Their 85-55 success against Bosnia and Herzegovina took them into the Quarter-Finals and helped them gain sweet revenge for a pair of 2021 losses to their European rivals. Hind Ben Abdelkader brought the noise with 18 points after a smart perimeter shooting display, while center Kyara Linskens continued her rich vein of form with 13 points and 7 rebounds, while Julie Allemand distributed 9 assists. A big downside was an injury to team leader Emma Meesseman who left the game early and is ruled out of the rest of the tournament.\n\nSerbia knock on the Quarter-Finals door\n\n\n\nA super display by Sasa Cado who fired six triples fuelled an 81-68 win for Serbia against Mali as they improved to 2-2 to keep their hopes of advancing to the Quarter-Finals alive. Tina Krajisnik did the business under the basket with a powerful double-double of 17 points and 12 rebounds. The loss means that Mali have had their feint hopes of qualifying extinguished.\n\nFIBA",

    "Kosovo-Serbia Tensions Are Reminder of Fragile Security, Unresolved Issues": "An agreement between Serbia and Kosovo, mediated over the weekend by the European Union and the U.S., settled a dispute over identity documents, but tensions over the matter, as well as license plates for ethnic Serbs in the north of Kosovo, are a reminder of the fragile stability in the region.\n\nCitizens can now move freely between the countries with their national ID cards. Until now, Kosovo citizens were given temporary Serbian documents when traveling to Serbia. In the latest deal, Kosovo agreed not to introduce entry/exit documents for Serbian ID holders.\n\nThe European Union's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, hailed the agreement.\n\n\"This is a European solution. We congratulate both leaders on this decision & their leadership,\" he said on Twitter.\n\n\"The United States supports this agreement and sees it as an important step forward towards normalized relations, centered on mutual recognition,\" a State Department spokesperson told VOA on Monday.\n\nBut analysts say it is precisely Serbia’s refusal to recognize the sovereignty of its former province that lies at the crux of the problems between the countries.\n\nDavid Kanin, adjunct professor of international relations at Johns Hopkins University and a former CIA senior analyst, told VOA, \"There's only one problem between Serbia and Kosovo, and that is the status of Kosovo.\" He said that problems such as ID cards and license plates are \"simply part of that issue.\"\n\nFrank Wisner, a retired U.S. ambassador who served as the U.S. special envoy to U.N.-backed talks between the countries, told VOA that the U.S. is steadfast in its support for Kosovo's independence from Serbia, which it declared in 2008.\n\n\"The United States has been foursquare behind Kosovo in consolidating that independence and achieving the widest possible recognition, but most particularly recognition by Serbia. That has not happened,\" he said, adding that it is not likely to happen soon.\n\nKosovo sees the latest agreement as one step on the road to mutual recognition, with Prime Minister Albin Kurti saying full reciprocity on other issues will be imposed, if an agreement to that end is not reached.\n\n\"We want there to be normalization to be achieved through an internationally and legally binding agreement for the complete normalization of relations with mutual recognition at the center,\" he said one day after the deal on ID cards was achieved.\n\nBut Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said that allowing border crossing with Kosovo ID cards is done for practical reasons and \"cannot be interpreted as recognition of Kosovo's independence.\"\n\nThe European Union is leading the dialogue between the countries. Five of its own members do not recognize Kosovo, and Kanin says that that puts Serbia in a comfortable position.\n\n\"On the Kosovo side, on the other hand, they can't do anything to force through their sovereignty because the context in which they are operating prevents their sovereignty from being universally recognized, because that context includes five members of the EU who do not recognize Kosovo as a country,\" he said.\n\nThe European Union has told both countries their EU aspirations hinge on normalizing relations.\n\nRoadblocks in Kosovo\n\nThe latest round of high-level diplomacy followed tensions in late July in a part of northern Kosovo where ethnic Serbs are in the majority, after Kosovo's government announced it would begin requiring Serbian document holders entering Kosovo to obtain temporary Kosovo-issued IDs, just as Kosovo citizens entering Serbia have had to do for over a decade.\n\nKosovo also said it would begin requiring ethnic Serbs living in Kosovo to use Kosovo license plates for their cars, instead of Serbian ones. Some local Serbs responded by blocking roads, prompting NATO to warn against escalation.\n\n\"Should stability be jeopardized KFOR stands ready to intervene and will take any measures that are necessary to ensure a safe and secure environment and freedom of movement for all the people of Kosovo,\" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said, referring to the 3,770-troop peacekeeping force in Kosovo.\n\nRoads were opened after Kurti agreed to postpone implementation of the plan for ID cards and license plates until September 1, but the flare-up was a reminder that security is fragile in a region where old disagreements are not settled and memories of the 1998-99 Kosovo war remain fresh. Kosovo still plans to implement the license plate requirement on September 1.\n\nBetween EU and Moscow\n\nSince the July flare-up, Moscow has repeatedly expressed its support for Serbia. The countries have historical ties. Serbia – like Kosovo and other Western Balkans countries – aspires to become an EU member, but unlike them it has not imposed sanctions on Russia.\n\nLast week its minister of interior, Alexandar Vulin, met in Moscow with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Referring to Western sanctions, Vulin said Belgrade \"will never engage in anti-Russian hysteria.\"\n\n“Serbia is the only state in Europe that didn’t introduce sanctions and was not part of the anti-Russian hysteria,” he told Lavrov.\n\nSerbia, however, has joined the U.N. resolution condemning Russia's invasion. In a Reuters interview on Monday, Vucic said that his country is the stage for a proxy war between East and West.\n\n\"You have a proxy war of big powers going on in Serbia through political players, the nongovernmental sector on both sides, the media and various social organizations, and you can see it every day, in every way,\" he said, speaking to Reuters at his office in Belgrade.\n\nKanin says Vucic is comfortable sitting on two stools.\n\n\"Serbia is not going along with Western policy in total,\" he said. \"They've gone along with certain things, [such as] the U.N. vote. There have been certain areas in which Vucic has leaned toward the Western stool. In certain situations, he leans toward the Russian stool.\"\n\nNext steps\n\nThere is no agreement yet on the license plates for local Serbs in Kosovo's North, and on Wednesday, Serbia's Vucic said he does not believe that a solution is possible.\n\n\"From September 1, [Kosovo] will ... try to force Serbs to change car plates, and I don't think they will have a big success\" Vucic told reporters.\n\nHowever, Major General Ferenc Kajari, the commander of NATO's peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, sought to dispel fears about a conflict. \"We are monitoring the situation ... and we don’t see even an indication of any preparation for a war,\" he told Reuters.\n\nThe U.S. envoy for the Western Balkans, Gabriel Escobar, has called on the parties to continue the dialogue and to implement all the agreements that they have agreed on, including one on a Community of Serb Municipalities in the North of Kosovo. Kurti is against such a monoethnic body with executive powers within the country.\n\nWhether one believes that incremental progress will ultimately yield mutual recognition or that agreements on practical matters are beneficial for their own sake, Kosovo and Serbia are bound to face their disagreements.\n\nWisner said full resolution is the ultimate goal, \"but you can only get there step by step.\"\n\n“It also falls to the two governments in Belgrade and Pristina to find steps short of a full resolution that will bring good sense to the region and allow practical solutions to practical problems and give time a chance to make a difference on the overall question of recognition.”\n\nBesim Abazi and Milan Nesic contributed to this report.

    "Serbia signs foreign policy document with Russia amid escalation of Ukraine war": "Members of the European Parliament warned Serbia on September 25 that Belgrade’s signing of a consultation plan with the Russian foreign ministry puts its EU accession progress at risk.\n\nThe consultation plan for the years 2023-2024 was signed by the Serbian and Russian foreign ministries on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York on September 24, at a point when Russia appears to be making a serious escalation of the war in Ukraine.\n\nThis weekend, referendums are taking place in Russian occupied parts of Ukraine on whether to become part of the Russian Federation. The conduct of the referendums, with some voters reportedly forced to polling stations at gunpoint, leaves little doubt that the decision has already been made to annex the territories. This follows Russian President Vladimir Putin’s announcement of partial mobilisation in Russia on September 21.\n\nAs an EU candidate country, Serbia has already come in for criticism from EU officials and European politicians for its refusal to impose sanctions on Russia, in line with EU foreign policy. Pre-war, Belgrade pursued a successful ‘four pillar’ foreign policy, balancing its relations with the EU, the US, Russia and China, but this has become hard to maintain after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February.\n\nThe European Parliament's rapporteur on Serbia Vladimir Bilcik wrote in response to the signing of the agreement: “As a keen supporter of any steps towards a European Serbia, I find the news of planned consultations between Serbia & Russia a major blow to accession process in the Western Balkans. Let’s be clear: Russia is mobilising to attack EU candidate state Ukraine, Russia is attacking EU enlargement!”\n\nEuropean Parliament rapporteur for Kosovo Viola von Cramon also competed on the development on Twitter, linking it to Serbia’s EU accession process.\n\n“This is a serious scandal. In the midst of raging war, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Serbia signs the plan on future collaboration with the Russian aggressor. Or maybe it’s just a signal for us to freeze the EU accession talks as entering the EU does not go through Moscow,” she wrote.\n\nThe consolation plan was signed by the foreign ministers of Russia and Serbia, Sergei Lavrov and Nikola Selakovic.\n\nAt a press conference on September 25, Selakovic appeared to downplay the importance of the document, calling it a “technical matter” and pointing out that such documents have been signed since 1996.\n\nSerbia conflicted\n\nIn a sign of the conflicts within Serbia over its relations with Russia and the West, Selakovic told the same press conference that Belgrade cannot accept the results of the referendum in the Ukrainian regions.\n\n“[I]t would be completely contrary to our national interests, our policy of preserving territorial integrity and sovereignty and commitment to the principle of inviolability of borders,” he said — a reference to Serbia’s own situation related to Kosovo’s unilateral declaration of independence.\n\nThere is speculation that the signing of the consultation plan with the Russia foreign ministry was intended to send a signal that Serbia is not moving decisively towards the West, despite its decision not to recognise the referendums in Ukraine.\n\nSerbia also sent a message about the priority it places on EU accession last weekend when it hosted the EuroPride 2002 parade in the face of strong opposition from the Serbian Orthodox Church and conservative groups linked to Russia.\n\nHowever, there remains a strong pro-Russian contingent in Serbia.\n\nInterior Minister Aleksandar Vulin, one of the more pro-Russian members of the Serbian cabinet, responded to Bilčik on September 25. “[T]he territorial integrity of Serbia is being attacked by 22 member states of the European Union, recognizing the fake state of Kosovo. Let's face it, this is a big blow to Serbia's European path,” said Vulin, as quoted by N1.\n\n“[T]o be clear, Serbia chooses its friends, and its enemies make themselves known,” he added.\n\nVulin has previously clashed with Energy and Mining Minister Zorana Mihajlovic, when the latter criticised Lavrov after Vulin’s visit to Moscow in August. Mihajlovic has accused the Russian foreign minister of “abusing” Serbia’s decision not to impose sanctions on Russia by falsely claiming Serbia supports Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMeanwhile, Misa Vacic, the leader of the far-right nationalist Serbian Right party, is one of the international observers for the referendums in occupied Ukraine. Vacic is currently in Volgograd where he is observing the vote at refugee camps housing people who have fled Ukraine but are still allowed to vote in the referendum, Russian and Serbian media reported.\n\nDuring his visit, Vacic reportedly presented the deputy governor of the Volgograd region with a T-shirt bearing the image of convicted war criminal Ratko Mladic.",
    "Serbia: Authorities must repeal “shameful” ban on Euro Pride walk": "Ahead of tomorrow’s planned Euro Pride walk in Belgrade which has been banned by Serbian authorities, Eve Geddie, Amnesty International’s Director at the European Institutions Office said:\n\n\n\n“The decision by Serbian authorities to ban Euro Pride for purported security reasons is shameful. Instead of giving in to hateful rhetoric towards and threats against LGBTI people, authorities must take all necessary measures to provide adequate protection for the participants and enable them to enjoy their rights without fear of harassment, intimidation or violence.\n\n\n\n“By allowing the walk to proceed, Serbia will cement its place as the first country in the Western Balkans to host Euro Pride in a region where LGBTI people experience daily discrimination and frequent violence. The authorities should lift the ban and allow the Euro Pride walk to go ahead unhindered.”\n\n\n\nBackground\n\n\n\nIn 2020, Belgrade nominated itself to host the Euro Pride. However, in August 2022, President Aleksandar Vučić, announced that the Pride walk would not be allowed to proceed. Organizers have said that the walk will take place despite the ban.\n\n\n\nOn 10 September, President Vučić said that the Ministry of Interior would make a decision 96 hours before the planned event.\n\n\n\nOn 13 September, the Ministry of Interior decided that neither the Pride walk, nor a planned counterprotest, could go ahead citing security issues, including “danger of violence, destruction of property, and other forms of disruption of public order on a larger scale”.\n\n\n\nOn 14 September, the organizers filed a complaint to the Administrative Court requesting it to overturn the Ministry’s decision. This is still pending.\n\n\n\nEarlier today, organizers submitted another formal request to the Ministry of Interior with a proposed shorter route for the walk. This was supported by 27,000 signatures. They are awaiting a decision from the authorities on their request.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Putin followed up on his mobilization order on September 24 by imposing harsher penalties against Russians who willingly surrendered to Ukrainian forces or refused orders to mobilize.\n\nRussian officials have said that up to 300,000 reserve forces will be called up and that only those with relevant combat and service experience will be drafted to fight. However, Russian media reports have surfaced saying that men who have never been in the military or who are past draft age are being called up, and foreign media have reported that the real goal is to mobilize more than 1 million soldiers, which the Kremlin denies.\n\nWestern officials say that Russia has suffered 70,000 to 80,000 casualties, accounting for both deaths and injuries, since it launched its unprovoked war in Ukraine in February.\n\nThe mobilization to replenish those losses has seen men across Russia sent to register and to reports of Russian citizens attempting to flee the country.\n\nSeveral military enlistment centers and other administrative buildings in the country have been targeted in arson attacks in recent days, and on September 26 a military commissioner was shot by an apparent recruit at an enlistment center in Siberia.\n\nMedia reports say the 25-year-old shooter had been called to report to the office in the city of Ust-Ilimsk for mobilization that day.\n\nThe draft has also led to rare complaints by pro-Kremlin voices.\n\nMargarita Simonyan, the editor in chief of the state-backed media outlet RT, wrote on her Telegram channel on September 24 that while it had been announced that only people up to the age of 35 would be recruited, \"summonses are going to 40-year-olds.\"\n\n\"They're infuriating people, as if on purpose, as if out of spite,\" Simonyan said of the authorities behind the draft.\n\nThe same day, the head of the Russian president's Human Rights Council, Valery Fadeyev, called on Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu to put a halt to the manner with which many draft boards in the country were proceeding.\n\nOn September 25, two of Russia's most senior lawmakers weighed in on the growing controversy.\n\nIn a Telegram post, Valentina Matviyenko, chairwoman of Russia's Federation Council, said that she was aware of reports that men who should be ineligible for the draft are being called up.\n\n\"Such excesses are absolutely unacceptable.

    "Serbia: Rescind Pride Ban, Guarantee Participant Protection": "Click to expand Image Participants attend the Euro Pride 2019 gay pride parade in Vienna, Austria on June 15, 2019. © JOE KLAMAR/AFP via Getty Images\n\nUpdate: On September 17, EuroPride 2022 went ahead, after EuroPride organizers notified authorities of a new route and received guarantees from the Prime Minister on Saturday morning that the March could go ahead safely. More than 5,000 police and military officers were deployed across Belgrade and 64 counter-protestors were arrested, according to Serbian authorities. At least seven LGBT people were attacked after the march, which victims reported to police. Thousands of participants walked from the Constitutional Court in Belgrade to a nearby park, along a much shorter route than originally planned. They were joined by the Council of Europe Human Rights Commissioner, Dunja Mijatović, the European Commissioner for Equality, Helena Dalli, Members of the European Parliament, and dozens of diplomats as well as other European and international leaders, marching in solidarity and in support of the rights to freedom of assembly and expression.\n\n(Berlin) – The Serbian government should immediately rescind its ban on EuroPride events scheduled for Belgrade in September 2022, Human Rights Watch said today. Instead, the authorities should work with organizers to ensure adequate safety for participants.\n\nOn August 27, President Aleksandar Vucic announced that the government is cancelling EuroPride, a regional event promoting equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people that Serbia was poised to host from September 12 to 18, with a march on September 17. Vucic acknowledged that the move is a “violation of minority rights,” but justified his decision because of threats from right wing groups to disrupt the event and rising border tensions with Kosovo. Prime Minister Ana Brnabic, a lesbian who is the first woman to hold the position, supported the cancellation, saying, “the first inviolable thing is to ensure peace and stability in the country.”\n\n“The Serbian government’s decision to cancel EuroPride is a shameful surrender to, and implicit sanctioning of, bigotry and threats of unlawful violence,” said Graeme Reid, director of the LGBT rights program at Human Rights Watch. “Street protests by far-right groups and religious entities have already taken place. Now Serbia has an obligation to also ensure the safety and dignity of EuroPride participants.”\n\nThe government announcement followed a demonstration by thousands of people on August 27 in Belgrade opposing the Europride events, with slogans such as, “save our children and our family.”\n\nOrganizers have indicated that they have not received formal notification of a ban and intend to hold the event as planned. “President Vucic cannot cancel someone else’s event,” said Kristine Garina, president of the European Pride Organizers Association. “EuroPride is not cancelled, and will not be cancelled. During the bidding process for EuroPride 2022, Prime Minister Brnabic promised the full support of the Serbian government … and we expect that promise to be honored,”\n\nThe co-chair of the European Parliament’s LGBTI InterGroup has indicated that she will attend regardless of Vucic’s cancellation. Serbian civil society groups indicated at the end of August that they plan to appeal any ban in court. Vucic has responded to criticism by saying, without sharing details, that the government will enforce the ban: “If a gathering is banned, then it will be banned. There will be no games with state decisions.”\n\nThe Serbian government, after banning Pride events between 2011 and 2013, has allowed parades in Belgrade since 2014, which have been peaceful. Serbian authorities’ justification for cancelling EuroPride 2022 bears a striking resemblance to Russia’s arguments, for banning marches by LGBT people on grounds that they could lead to violent clashes with counterdemonstrators. The European Court of Human Rights struck down that argument in Alekseyev v. Russia in 2010 as a violation of the right to peaceful assembly.\n\nIn rejecting the Russian government's argument, the court reiterated that there is “no ambiguity” about “the right of individuals to openly identify themselves as gay, lesbian or any other sexual minority, and to promote their rights and freedoms, in particular by exercising their freedom of peaceful assembly.” The court emphasized that by refusing LGBT rights activists the right to peaceful assembly, “the authorities effectively endorsed the intentions of persons and organizations that clearly and deliberately intended to disrupt a peaceful demonstration in breach of the law and public order.”\n\nRather than banning demonstrations because third parties threaten public order, the authorities should be fulfilling their duty to ensure that police protect peaceful demonstrators exercising their right to freedom of assembly, Human Rights Watch said. Based on human rights jurisprudence regarding pride marches, law enforcement authorities should remember they are there to protect those participating in the event.\n\nAs a member of the Council of Europe, Serbia should adhere to the Council’s standards to combat discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity, including that member states should ensure everyone’s freedom of peaceful assembly without any discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity. The Council of Europe standards also say governments should not misuse legal and administrative provisions to impose restrictions on freedom of expression and peaceful assembly on grounds of public health, public morality, and public order.\n\nArticle 21 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Serbia ratified in 2001, explicitly protects the right to peaceful assembly. In a 2016 report, the UN special rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association specified that, “The State’s failure to protect participants in a peaceful rally against violent, fundamentalist counter-protesters, for example, constitutes a violation of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly.” The special rapporteur said that the government “has a positive duty to protect those exercising their right to peaceful assembly, even if they are promoting unpopular positions (e.g., rights for LGBTI persons or those of a minority religion).”\n\nIn a 2022 report, the rapporteur emphasized that “Protests have been particularly important in facilitating participation of otherwise excluded groups such as … LGBTQI+ persons and other marginalized communities and victims’ groups … Where States adopt securitized, hostile approaches to protests, rather than welcoming them as an important part of democratic life, the result is often to deepen underlying crises.”\n\n“Instead of opportunistically pandering to anti-rights groups, Serbian authorities should work with EuroPride organizers to make the event safe and guarantee the right to peaceful assembly,” Reid said. “Threats against LGBT people’s dignity and rights should receive a serious reaction from the government.

The barricades were dismantled only when NATO peacekeepers stepped in to oversee the process and Kosovo agreed to postpone the licensing demand.\n\nDuring her first visit to Kosovo since she took over as prime minister in 2017, Brnabic said: “Compromise in the interest of peace and stability – definitely yes.”\n\nIn the ethnically divided city of Mitrovica, about 1,000 local Serbs greeted Brnabic, waving Serbian flags and holding signs that read “We have only one prime minister” and “Welcome to Serbia, holy land of Kosovo”.\n\n“I sincerely hope that the temporary institutions in Pristina become genuinely committed to dialogue and finding a certain compromise needed for long-term normalisation of ties between Belgrade and Pristina,” said Brnabic during a news conference, referring to Kosovo authorities.\n\n“That is something we need – not just for our European integration – but for ourselves,” she said.\n\nSerbia has been a candidate to join the European Union since 2012. However, most experts doubt the country stands a chance of entering the bloc until Belgrade hammers out a deal to normalise ties with Kosovo.\n\nBrnabic’s delegation travelled with a heavy security detail, while NATO troops were stationed along the main roads in the area and a helicopter circled overhead.\n\nDuring her one-day Kosovo tour, the 46-year-old was set to visit educational facilities, a Serbian Orthodox monastery, and chat with local farmers.\n\nIn another show of willingness to mend relations, Kosovo ministers visited areas in southern Serbia where Albanians are in the majority.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron, wrote to Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti on Sunday saying normal ties between Kosovo and Serbia are “of crucial importance” to the region.\n\n“Recent tensions have shown that constructive steps forward are urgently needed, both on the practical and the political level,” Scholz and Macron wrote in the letter, which was published by both Vucic’s and Kurti’s offices.\n\nTalks between Kosovo and Serbia under the auspices of the EU and US envoys have so far failed to solve the licence plates issue, although Belgrade and Pristina reached a deal on the use of personal identity documents.\n\nSerbs account for 5 percent of the 1.8 million people in Kosovo and Serbia accuses Kosovo of trampling on their rights, a charge denied by Pristina.\n\nKosovo is recognised by some 100 countries, including the United States and all but five EU members, but not by a number of other states, notably Russia and China.",

The numbers say it all: Serbia’s raspberry crop produced 118,674 tons in 2020, according to the Republic Statistical Office (SORS) data.\n\nHome of unique and ancient cultures\n\nSerbia is home to one of the oldest cities in the world. Apart from Belgrade, two of Europe’s most ancient cities and two of the unique cultures of the Bronze Age, the ruins of Vinca and Starcevo, are located not far from Belgrade. This ancient civilization dates back to 5000 years BC and it left behind sculptures that are kept in museums and archives in Belgrade.\n\n“Vampire” is a Serbian word\n\nThe word “vampire” is of Serbian origin, believe it or not.

    "Serbia seeks fighter it might choose MiG-35 or JF-17 Block 3": "BELGRADE ($1=121.06 Serbian Dinars) — The Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Serbia is in the process of renewing its armament. Serbian sources say the time has come for a new Serbian fighter jet. Serbia has already bought Pantsir-S1 mobile air defense systems, the Chinese FK-3 anti-aircraft surface-to-air missile system, and the Chinese CH-92A reconnaissance and attack drones.\n\nPhoto credit: Pan.bg\n\nSerbian pilots are impressed by the Russian fighter MiG-35 4++ generation. As BulgarianMilitary.com previously wrote, the MiG-35 is one of the most successful Russian fighters, in no way inferior to its competitors in the same class. However, Russia is gradually abandoning the project, and if it does not find a customer soon, the MiG-35 will be forgotten, like many other Russian weapons.\n\nThe MiG-35 will be rejected by Belgrade. The reasons will not be the operational capabilities of the aircraft or the characteristics. The reasons will be political, local analysts comment. According to them, the fear that Washington will attack such a decision by Belgrade with economic sanctions under the CAATSA law will dissuade the Serbs. The possibility of this happening leans more towards one hundred percent.\n\nSome Serbian experts immediately turned their attention to another alternative. Of course, it is not an American opportunity, but a Chinese one. China’s JF-17 Bok 3. As already mentioned, Serbia buys from China. Sources close to Serbian political circles in Belgrade believe that the JF-17 Bok 3 will be not only a compromise but also a successful solution to the Serbian fighter jet crisis. Currently, the Serbian Air Force operates only 14 units of obsolete MiG-29s.\n\nPhoto credit: Pakistan Air Force\n\nWhy the JF-17 Bok III? The JF-17 Bok III is a 4th generation fighter but is equipped with 5th generation avionics and weapons. The operational costs of the fighter are low and this will also influence the decision. Also, the JF-17 Block III uses technology from the J-20 stealth fighter.\n\nSerbian experts comment that in case of possible prolonged air attacks, a Chinese fighter is an optimal option. The airframe of the JF-17 is capable of maintaining a high level of readiness. Aircraft maintenance is also kept to a minimum. Last but not least, it is expected that if Serbia buys the JF-17 it will receive it with its full armament. I.e. Belgrade will acquire high-class air-to-air missiles.\n\nSerbia may decide to turn to France and try to acquire Rafael. But, JF-17 and MiG-29 have a common engine. I.e. Belgrade may decide not to retire its MiG-29 fleet, but to augment it with JF-17s. However, this means that the Serbian budget will be increased more than expected because the MiG-29 will need a heavy modernization.\n\n***\n\nFollow us everywhere and at any time.

    "Air Serbia Awards 20 Millionth Passenger With Surprise Free Flight": "Air Serbia welcomed its 20 millionth passenger this week. The passenger, Simonida Bugarčić, was flying on flight JU500 from Air Serbia’s base, Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport (BEG), to New York’s John F. Kennedy Airport (JFK).\n\nA surprise gift\n\nAfter a “boarding complete” announcement was made for Air Serbia’s flight JU500 in Belgrade, passengers were treated to a surprise announcement.\n\nSimonida Bugarčić, flying to New York as a tourist, was called forward as the airline’s 20 millionth passenger since the “Air Serbia” brand was launched in 2013.\n\nShe then received a surprise gift: a free flight to any destination in Air Serbia’s network for two persons. The prize was presented to her by Air Serbia’s CEO, Jiří Marek.\n\nMarking the occasion, Marek said:\n\n“We are very happy to have carried our 20-millionth passenger just a month before our ninth birthday. We celebrate this important success in the year in which we had record-setting results during the summer season, in terms of passengers carried, while at the same time, we have positioned ourselves as the leading airline in the region also in terms of the number of flights. The trust of our passengers and the dedication of our employees represent the foundation and strong motivation for further improvement of our operations and offers. We thank Simonida for choosing Air Serbia and believe this prize will be used to create new memories.”\n\nThe passenger got to comment too: she said she does not fly often but, when she does, she flies Air Serbia.\n\nThe passenger received a free flight for two persons.

    "Serbia to get 500-million-euro loan for Belgrade-Niš railway line": "2013, Wikimedia Commons/Gogo303, Based on Pan-European corridors.svg\n\nSerbia will in all likelihood secure a loan of 500 million euros from the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in order to upgrade the railway line connecting Belgrade to Niš. Once this upgrade is completed, freight and passenger trains will be able to run at a speed of 200 kilometres per hour from Niš up till Novi Sad, north of Belgrade.\n\nThe loan has already passed the ‘concept review’ stage and is currently under ‘structure review’, as the EBRD describes it. Once all the lights are green, the project can go ahead. The approval deadline is 30 November.\n\nCorridor X\n\nWhile the railway section is only 228 kilometres long, it forms a relevant link for rail freight across Europe. This is because it lies at the heart of the so-called Corridor X, which runs from Salzburg in Austria to Thessaloniki in Greece, and via a second branch from Budapest in Hungary to Istanbul in Turkey. These two branches form the shape of an X, and the lines intersect in the middle of Serbia – on the Belgrade-Niš line.\n\nThe aim of the modernisation works is to enable a speed increase to up to 200 kilometres per hour. At such a speed, the journey would be covered in 1 hour and 15 minutes, whereas the current travel time between Belgrade and Niš is 5,5 hours. The works will be carried out by SRI, a joint stock company established as the sole national railway infrastructure asset management company of Serbia.\n\nEuropean interest\n\nAlthough there are parts of Corridor X that are financed by China, and in the past also by Russia, the EU is taking a clear stance with the financing of the central part of the network. As one European Commission official put it several months ago, it is in the EU’s key interest to pursue its enlargement policy more effectively. In that view, the construction of critical infrastructure is central to the Western Balkans.\n\nThis article first appeared on RailFreight.com.\n\nFurther reading:",
    "Albanian PM calls for understanding over Serbia’s Russian stance": "Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama has expressed concern over Russian influence in the country, while showing understanding for the stance of Belgrade towards Moscow.\n\nSerbia remains Russia’s only firm ally in Europe, aside from Belarus, with President Aleksander Vučić refusing to follow EU sanctions. At the same time, parades with Russian flags and placards bearing his Russian counterpart’s face are common in the capital.\n\nOn the topic of the Ukraine war, Rama told the Austrian newspaper Die Presse, “It is a potential threat to our region. Because in parts of the Balkans, Russia traditionally has had a strong influence. This is especially true for Serbia, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Republika Srpska in Bosnia and Herzegovina.”\n\nHe added that it is important to keep this potential threat out of the Balkans, but no more pressure should be put on Serbia to impose EU sanctions.\n\n“Such sanctions are not possible because, without Russia, Serbia cannot survive. Moreover, the government and President Aleksandar Vučić would not politically survive the sanctions against Russia. Serbia has already taken a stand. We must not forget that Belgrade has already voted three times against Russia at the UN. This is a big surprise,” he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Vučić told parliament that there would never be direct or indirect recognition of Kosovo, despite the “hysteria of the international community” due to the war in Ukraine.\n\nRussia has remained steadfast in its support of Serbia’s “territorial integrity” regarding the Kosovo issue, leading to concerns it could lead to further destabilisation in the region. This is despite long-term EU mediation between the two countries in hopes of finding normalisation of relations.\n\nVučić said that he would not recognise Kosovo directly or indirectly, nor would he give up the legitimate fight for national interests and international law, reported Euronews Serbia.\n\n“The danger is imminent, objective, and serious, and the representatives of the Serbian people can best testify to this. Serbia has not participated in the generation of the crisis in any way, shape or form. Despite everything, Serbia is ready for dialogue”, he emphasised.",

    "End of year could be crunch time for Kosovo-Serbia dialogue": "During an interview on Tuesday, the former prime minister of Kosovo, Ramush Haradinaj, said a mutual recognition agreement with Serbia could be finalised by the end of the year as the Serbian prime minister pushes for the controversial association of Serb municipalities by the same date.\n\nKosovo declared independence in 2008 after the bloody 1998-1999 Kosovo war with Serbia, of which it was a former province. Since then, EU-led dialogue for normalisation has been largely unsuccessful, with most signed agreements not implemented and mutual recognition, which Serbia says will never happen, not once being on the table.\n\n“Serbia will insist on what it calls full normalisation without recognition, de jure. I think this will be the last battle between Kosovo and Serbia, the allies to fully agree with Serbia. The agreement for the full normalisation of Kosovo-Serbia based on mutual recognition is close. I believe it is before Christmas,” he said.\n\nThis will be based on years of work; he added while thanking the EU and the US for their involvement.\n\n“I am convinced we are in the right direction; it would be good news for us. The news about the agreement would be a kind of liberation,” he added.\n\nMeanwhile, former Serbian minister and leader of the People’s Party Vuk Jeremic said that if Kosovo does not accept the formation of the Association of Serb Municipalities, there will be no agreements.\n\nHe said in a resolution that a deadline should be set for 31 December this year and that Serbia should declare all Brussels mediation unsuccessful and over.\n\n“It is part of the Resolution for Kosovo and Metohija that the People’s Party will propose to the Assembly of Serbia”, said Jeremic.\n\nHe emphasised that the resolution commits the Government not to take any steps to enable Kosovo’s membership in international organisations, primarily the UN.\n\nHis statements echo the sentiments of Serbian Prime Minister Ana Brnabic, who, during a visit to Kosovo’s Serb majority north at the weekend, said there is no chance of further agreements on normalisation if the association is not formed.\n\n“The establishment of the community of Serbian municipalities is the basis of the Brussels agreement, of the first agreement on normalisation, and until we have the association of Serbian municipalities, it is impossible to discuss the second agreement on normalisation,” she said.\n\nThe association is a planned self-governing but backed by a Belgrade institution comprising the Serb-majority municipalities of Kosovo, including some 50,000 people. It would create a situation similar to that of Bosnia and Herzegovina, where a separate entity, with the support of Belgrade, exists within another country.\n\nKosovo has flatly refused to consider such an option saying it is unconstitutional and also completely wrong to ask a sovereign country to allow the formation of an independent and self-governing entity within its borders.\n\nStakeholders say it is unfair to ask Kosovo to yield some of its national integrity as part of negotiations to gain reciprocity and rights to which it is entitled in the EU, NATO and UN.\n\nThe EU has pushed for the establishment of the association but has remained tight-lipped on the jurisdiction and executive powers that would be bestowed on it.",

General Assembly meeting in New York, where most Western delegations shunned Russia’s top diplomat over the country’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe consultation plan covered by the agreement is expected to last for two years, Serbia’s foreign ministry said in a Friday statement.

Aligning foreign policies with the EU is one of the main pre-conditions for joining the 27-nation bloc, but Serbia has increasingly defied calls to do so.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMedia in Serbia and Russia said Serbia’s populist president, Aleksandar Vucic, met Lavrov in New York and the two “emphasized the joint focus on further dynamic development of Russian-Serbian relations.”\n\nOfficials from Serbia’s pro-Western opposition said the signing of the latest deal with Russia is a sign that Vucic, a former ultranationalist, has given up on the Balkan country joining the EU and is bringing it closer into Moscow’s fold.\n\nThe centrist SSP opposition party said “it is incredible” that at a time when most of the world is apprehensively watching Moscow’s actions, Serbia signed an agreement to consult with a country “that directly violates the U.N. Charter and intends to annex the (Ukrainian) territory.”\n\nInterior Minister Aleksandar Vulin, Vucic’s informal spokesperson, said in a statement that “expanding cooperation with Russia is not a matter of respecting the past but a responsible decision facing the future.”\n\nSerbia is important for Russia as a way to destabilize the Balkans and potentially shift part of the world’s attention from the war in Ukraine.",
    "Türkiye welcomes relative peace between Serbia, Kosovo: Erdoğan": "President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on Wednesday welcomed relief of tension between Serbia and Kosovo, calling for dialogue to solve problems.\n\nSpeaking at a joint press conference with his Serbian counterpart Alexandar Vucic in Belgrade, Erdoğan said that the positive momentum in Balkans should continue, adding: \"Balkans can no longer tolerate adversity.\"\n\nTürkiye sees Serbia as a key country for peace and stability in the Balkans, he added.\n\nTouching upon the bilateral ties, Erdoğan said that passport-free travel with Serbia would take bilateral relations to \"a new level.\"\n\nDuring Erdoğan's visit, the second stop on a three-nation Balkan tour, Türkiye and Serbia signed seven agreements in such areas as the economy, industry, and technology, including a protocol allowing mutual passport-free travel for nationals on both sides.\n\nVucic, for his part, welcomed Turkish investments, saying both countries aim to raise bilateral trade volume to $2.5B.\n\nSerbia counts on Türkiye's support for the continuation of talks to resolve lingering disputes with Kosovo, the Serbian foreign minister said on Friday.\n\nDialogue between Belgrade and Pristina will \"lead to a compromise and a mutually acceptable solution, and contribute to the preservation of regional peace and stability,\" Nikola Selakovic said in a statement after meeting his Turkish counterpart Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu in the capital Belgrade.\n\nSerbia and Kosovo last month agreed on a new border policy under an EU-facilitated dialogue process.\n\nTensions were rising in the region over Kosovo's plans to make it mandatory for everyone, including Serbs living in the north, to have a Kosovo ID card and license plates for cars.\n\nKosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, with most U.N. member states, including the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Türkiye, recognizing it as a separate autonomous country. Serbia, however, continues to claim Kosovo as its territory.\n\nUkraine war\n\nAnother topic Erdoğan mentioned was the war in Ukraine and its impacts on Europe. Erdoğan said he does not find the attitude of the West \"right,\" adding that they are following a \"policy of provocation\" toward Russia.\n\n\"I can clearly say that I do not find the attitude of the West (towards Russia) right. Because there is a West that follows a policy based on provocation,\" Erdoğan said.\n\nSince the outbreak of the war in Ukraine this February, Türkiye has stressed it is following a \"balanced\" policy that has yielded dividends, such as the historic deal in Istanbul this July unblocking grain exports from Ukraine.\n\nErdoğan added that it does not seem the Russia-Ukraine war will end \"anytime soon,\" adding: \"I say to those who underestimate Russia, you are doing it wrong. Russia is not a country that can be underestimated.\"\n\nThe president also reiterated Ankara's balanced policy between Russia and Ukraine to help solve the crisis.\n\nThe Turkish policy of keeping lines of diplomacy open with Russia has also resulted in Türkiye hosting the highest-level meetings of officials from Moscow and Kyiv since the war begin.\n\nErdoğan was welcomed with an official ceremony in Serbia's capital Belgrade, on the second leg of his three-nation Balkan tour.\n\nThe two leaders held one-on-one talks and inter-delegation meetings, followed by a joint news conference.\n\nDuring the talks, all aspects of the bilateral relations were reviewed and steps to enhance cooperation in various areas were discussed. Developments in the Balkans and international issues were also on the agenda.\n\nErdoğan later attended the Türkiye-Serbia Business Forum and visited Belgrade Castle.\n\nErdoğan on Tuesday started his three-nation Balkan tour with Bosnia-Herzegovina. His last stop will be Croatia on Thursday.\n\nPreviously, Erdoğan said Türkiye pays \"special importance\" to the Balkans and that preserving peace and stability in the region is vital for the country.\n\nThe Balkans is a priority for Türkiye not only from the political, economic and geographical perspectives but also due to its historical, cultural and human ties with the region.\n\nIn recent years, the Balkans region has become an attractive market for Turkish investors with its qualified workforce, business-friendly investment environment, and tax and financial incentives.\n\nThe region is often described as Türkiye's gateway to the EU, thanks to its geographical location."
