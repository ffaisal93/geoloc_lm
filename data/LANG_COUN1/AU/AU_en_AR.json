    "Argentina’s socialist demons are coming for the West": "How did we arrive at the position where, throughout the Western world, political decisions to undermine the cheapest and most reliable energy sources are bringing about economic stagnation and possibly collapse?\n\nNotwithstanding evidence of this, why are policy settings intensifying the very measures that have created the breakdown?\n\nEurope is seeing record energy prices and the America’s renewable subsidy-oriented Inflation Reduction Act portends a following of suit.\n\nFor Australia, similar measures are intensified by law courts deciding that individual Indigenous voices, now extending to a need to protect ‘sea country’, can veto new gas and coal projects. The government wishes to strengthen these voices, which add to the damage of Mr Albanese’s ominous declaration that he ‘has a plan’ to combat climate change.\n\nThe vast majority of politicians have always seen themselves as improving on what they perceive to be the chaos of the market system. They would override the ‘dog-eat-dog’ market decisions on the best technologies, the location of facilities, the creation of skills, and the allocation of capital investment from a seductive ‘holistic’ perspective. Many also would argue that their own allocatory decisions would make savings by dispensing with so-called inessentials like advertising and the revenues siphoned off in profit.\n\nDisappointing outcomes from previous failures of such policies fail to dampen the enthusiasm of the next generation who chalk off those failures as being due to poor management, which they will avoid.\n\n\n\n\n\nMoreover, politicians are, with very few exceptions, simply the readers of political research and retailers of the voter preferences which that research reveals. In the main, they subscribe to the philosophy, ‘I got into this business because I wanted to make a difference’, as expressed in the words of a minister in the BBC series The Thick of It . The problem is that politicians most readily make a difference by awarding favours, righting wrongs, and addressing inequalities by drawing from funding they do not have. In doing so, they actually make things worse, not least because in raising funds and introducing regulations they create deterrents to invest and innovate, while at the same time imposing dead-weight public service paper-burden costs.\n\nConvictions that the present system of production and consumption is causing damaging climate change are superimposed on this tapestry. Irrespective of the impossibilities of coordinating the whole world to agree to a carbon constraint, the trivial effect of higher emissions on the climate and its measures’ adverse productivity imposts, this offers a powerful amalgam that combines supposed environmental externalities with the putative nectar of socialism.\n\nAs the strong political consensus in favour of market interventions to promote ‘clean energy’ demonstrates, most political activists who nominally reject socialism are not immune from those forces.\n\nBoris Johnson was lionised as a champion of small government conservative voices, but in power showed himself to be a market interventionist uxoriously besotted by the fashionable Climate Change agenda.\n\nAustralia is no stranger to such apostasy.\n\nDavid Kemp has been seen as an important contributor to libertarian free market thinking. But, as John Howard’s Environment Minister, his policies included coordinating with Labor state governments to expropriate thousands of landowners’ properties so they could be converted into non-productive ‘carbon sinks’ in order to meet the government’s Kyoto emission reduction goals. More recently, the Morrison Liberal government pandered to the environmental Woke by, for example, rejecting impartial advice to cease subsidising rooftop solar panels and in preventing gas exploration off the New South Wales coast.\n\nThe politicians who have successfully rolled back this socialistic interventionism are an exceedingly rare breed. None may be presently in power anywhere in the world.\n\nIn the past, we have seen giants like Thatcher, Reagan, Trump, Deng Xiaoping, and the architect of Germany’s economic miracle Ludwig Erhard create economic resurgences from the ashes of economies in seeming terminal decline. In all cases, the approach was to eliminate regulations and reduce spending. The closest we got to that in Australia was the early administration of Malcolm Fraser (with considerable help from a John Stone led Treasury) in reversing the statist politics of Gough Whitlam, and the doomed efforts of Tony Abbott who unfortunately presided over a parliamentary party so inept that they replaced him with Malcolm Turnbull, the epitome of green socialism.\n\nIt may be that disastrously high energy cost outcomes of the current policies will bring about a correction in Australia and elsewhere, but there is nothing pre-ordained about such a retreat from the precipice.\n\nArgentina offers a dismal precedent. Over the course of a century, the nation went from one of the richest to one of the poorest nations in the world.\n\nThe people elected governments some of which were nominally of the left and some nominally of the right. In all cases, the governments introduced regulatory restraints, spent money that they did not have, or raised funds with punitive taxes on the inevitably declining number of ‘haves’ to provide additional favours to their supporters. The upshot of lower living standards has, however, not resulted in a revolt against the policies causing that outcome. Rather, we see popular demonstrations demanding even more of the same policies.\n\nIt was Albert Einstein who said, ‘The true definition of madness is repeating the same action, over and over, hoping for a different result.’ Hopefully, sanity will be restored.",
    "All tire-manufacturing plants in Argentina close down": "All tire-manufacturing plants in Argentina close down\n\n26th Monday, September 2022 - 10:16 UTC Full article\n\nThe automotive industry might follow suit shortly without the input\n\nArgentina has ceased to be a tire-manufacturing country as labor conflicts resulted in the closing of all three plants nationwide, although some of these measures have been reported to be a temporary issue.\n\nPirelli stopped production this weekend due to the lack of inputs because of union blockades dating back to over 100 days, joining Fate and Bridgestone. Unable to bring in nitrogen trucks Friday with such an essential input, the company Saturday closed down operations until further notice.\n\nBefore the union conflict, the plant had been operating at 50% of its capacity due to labor protests that kept part of the staff out of the premises.\n\nThese developments endanger the automotive industry, particularly companies that produce pickup trucks, which rely on local supply and may now too need to stop production. Nissan and Renault have already stopped production of the Frontier and Alaskan models in Córdoba.\n\nThe Sindicato Único de Trabajadores del Neumático Argentino (SUTNA), run by the left-wing Partido Obrero, has threatened to further radicalize the conflict, according to Ámbito. In the meantime, a nationwide shortage of tires has led to a huge increase in the price of the stock still available and also to the growth of smuggling.\n\nBridgestone announced the temporary closure of its operations in Argentina. As is publicly known, Bridgestone continues to face protracted union negotiations with Sutna in the framework of the 2021/2022 union review. At Bridgestone, the well-being and safety of our employees are our most important values and, as such, we are committed to providing a safe workplace for every employee, a statement from the company read.\n\nAs a result of the ongoing conflict on September 23, Bridgestone has decided to temporarily close all operations in Argentina to protect each person who is part of our team and to guarantee the integrity of our property, the document went on.\n\nWhile it has not yet been determined when we will be able to resume operations, we will do so when we can guarantee the safety of all collaborators, it also noted.\n\nBridgestone will continue to work with the commitment to overcome this situation that currently puts the supply of tires in the market at risk. The company currently employs some 1,600 people.\n\nMeanwhile, Union leaders have camped at the doorsteps of the Labor Ministry in Buenos Aires to press for a solution to the crisis. workers have deemed the salary increases offered by employers as insignificant in the country's current inflation scenario.\n\nLiberal Deputy José Luis Espert said it was necessary to apply a jail or bullet policy to the workers and union representatives who carry out protests. Espert, of Javier Milei's political movement, was heavily criticized for his remarks.\n\nWhile Fate said unions should be stripped of their legal status to close companies, the company still maintained it did share Espert's statements.",

    "Argentina unbeaten run nearing Italy world record streak: When Lionel Messi and Albiceleste might break it": "With their latest dominant showing against Honduras in September 2022, Argentina extended its unbeaten streak to 34, the longest active undefeated streak and nearing the longest in international football history.\n\nThe run, which began in 2019, has seen the Argentina national side win Copa America 2021, beating Brazil 1-0 in their own country. It's an impressive run from Lionel Scaloni's side, and the perfect form to be carrying into November's World Cup in Qatar. Argentina qualified for Qatar with games to spare due to their impressive form, sealing a spot nearly a year before the tournament finals.\n\nHowever, despite going unbeaten, they still finished second in the standings for World Cup qualifying. Brazil ended ahead of them, also unbeaten through qualification, but with more wins and fewer draws.\n\nRegardless, avoid defeat against Jamaica on Tuesday, Sept. 27 and Scaloni's side will have matched the unbeaten runs set by Spain and Brazil with only Italy to catch.\n\nMORE: Group C in 2022 World Cup, featuring Argentina & Mexico\n\nArgentina unbeaten streak at 34 and counting\n\nArgentina's impressive run of results has included three games against Brazil. Two of those were wins for Messi's side, including the 2021 Copa America final, and one that ended in a draw. Of five games against Chile, two were wins, while three were draws.\n\nNot included in the unbeaten run is the game against Brazil that was scheduled to take place in September 2021. That game was suspended after a few minutes of play, when Brazilian health authorities took to the pitch after four Argentina players broke quarantine regulations by taking part in the game.

    "Against all odds, Lionel Messi has one last shot at World Cup glory with Argentina": "Argentina went to Russia in 2018 with a sense it was now or never. They had lost in the final of the previous World Cup. A great generation of attacking talent was ageing. Lionel Messi was 31 and two years earlier had flirted with international retirement after a second successive Copa América final defeat to Chile. And at last the Argentinian Football Association had managed to appoint, in Jorge Sampaoli, a dynamic and progressive coach who promised to restore the days of Bielsista optimism.\n\nMessi scored one brilliant goal, against Nigeria and there was a spirited exit against France in the last 16, but the last World Cup was a huge disappointment. There was a drab draw against Iceland and an embarrassingly comprehensive defeat to Croatia.\n\nSampaoli, meanwhile, seemed overwhelmed by the job, grey-faced and sweating as he failed to overcome the basic incompatibility of Argentina’s fleet of lumbering defenders with his demand for a hard press and a high line.\n\nIt was clear he had to go, but the AFA, sclerotic and riven by factional infighting, was as good as broke even before paying off his contract. When Lionel Scaloni, the former West Ham full-back, was appointed to replace him, initially as a caretaker, his greatest qualification was that, having already been employed as one of Sampaoli’s assistants, he was cheap.\n\nArgentina slipped into pessimism: the production line that had brought five Under-20 World Cups between 1995 and 2007 was broken and Messi’s powers seemed to be waning.\n\nSometimes, though, things just work out. Last year, Argentina beat Brazil at the Maracanã to win the Copa América. It was an extra tournament added to the schedule to raise funds for impoverished federations under the guise of rejigging the calendar and it had been a largely soulless event played in empty stadiums by players who had openly contemplated a boycott. But for Argentina all that mattered was that the 28-year trophy drought was over. And now la Scaloneta, as this side has become known, can contemplate more.\n\nArgentina fans pay tribute to Lionel Messi after the victory against Honduras in Miami. Photograph: Chandan Khanna/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Messi story has always felt somehow dramatically unsatisfying because it lacks shade. Since he arrived at Barcelona as a 13 -year-old he has been, at least at club level, absurdly consistent and relentlessly successful. There have been none of the operatic rises and falls that characterised the life of the great hero to whom he must always be compared. Diego Maradona suffered a badly broken ankle, hepatitis and cocaine addiction.\n\nMessi sometimes got irritated with his teammates. This, though, might be the glory towards which his career has been heading, dragging Argentina at the age of 35, after all seemed lost, to an improbable third World Cup.\n\nThat’s the romantic view, one encouraged by Messi’s exceptional form for Paris Saint-Germain. But as ever with Argentina there are practical issues, largely to do with the incompetence of AFA.\n\nIt is only a year since Argentina’s World Cup qualifier against Brazil was abandoned as police and health officials entered the pitch in an attempt to detain three players for alleged breaches of Covid protocols. Cristian Romero missed Friday’s friendly against Honduras in Miami after visa delays supposedly caused by the bank holiday declared for the Queen’s funeral. “It’s a problem,” said Scaloni, “because this is the last date we have to get together and train, he can’t be here.”\n\nBut that is not the only issue. There is frustration in Argentina that the Uefa Nations League denies them both variety and quality of opponents. The 3-0 win against Honduras extended Argentina’s unbeaten run to 34 games and they should move a step closer to Italy’s record of 37 against Jamaica on Tuesday.\n\nThat Italy’s record was set between two World Cups for which they failed to qualify, even if it did incorporate success in the Euros, perhaps indicates the value of such statistics, but perhaps more pertinent is that Argentina’s run includes just four games against non-Latin American sides.\n\nThey were impressive in beating Italy 3-0 in the Copa Finalissima – the meeting between the winners of the Euros and the Copa America at Wembley in June – but that aside, before Friday Argentina’s only game against a non-Conmebol side in the past three years was a 5-0 friendly victory over Estonia. That is not a World Cup preparation anybody would plan.\n\nSign up to The Fiver Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I don’t feel like we’re at a different pace.”\n\nHonduras were a different challenge, muscular and aggressive, less than ideal friendly opponents in that regard as well. But la Scaloneta were unflustered. The front three may not have the glitz of Argentinian forward lines of the recent past, but it has balance and they work well together. Messi drifts in from the right to operate as a No 10 and it was from that position he created the two goals before half-time, first with a delicious scooped ball over the top (Papu Gómez low cross and Lautaro Martínez finish) and the second with a slipped through-ball (Papu Gómez pulled back; Messi penalty).\n\nThe third goal was a Messi chip, perhaps not quite as delicately brilliant as the one against Mexico in 2007 but more than enough to encourage those who would believe the power of narrative. Perhaps just as significantly, it stemmed from a midfield press led by the young Benfica midfielder Enzo Fernández. The structures work.\n\nQuestions remain, notably in the enduringly problematic full-back area. Neither right-backGonzalo Montiel nor the back-up left-back, Marcos Acuña, are playing regularly for their clubs. Ángel Correa and Joaquin Correa tend to be used from the bench for Atlético and Internazionale. Ángel Di María has so struggled for game time at Juventus. The AFA remains the AFA.\n\nBut they have a pattern and a style. They have confidence. They would have liked more exposure to high-level European opposition, but the dream of Messi’s glorious finale is very much alive.",
    "Health officials probe Argentina pneumonia cases; three dead": "Argentine health authorities are investigating a cluster of pneumonia cases from an unknown cause that has led to three deaths among 10 cases identified so far.\n\nThe illnesses have been centred around a private medical clinic in the city of San Miguel de Tucuman, Argentina’s fifth-largest city, located in the north-west part of the country.

    "Argentina vice president slams corruption case as ‘staged fable’": "Buenos Aires, Argentina – Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has delivered a fiery final word in her defence, calling corruption allegations against her a “staged fable designed to drag me by the hair to this trial”.\n\nIn closing arguments before a federal court on Friday, Argentina’s powerful vice president also linked the judicial proceedings to an assassination attempt on her earlier this month, and suggested that some of the people behind the September 1 attack have yet to be apprehended.\n\n“Until the first of September, I believed that this was all about stigmatising me, banning me, denigrating me, defaming me. But as of the first of September, I realised that there may be something else behind all this,” she said.\n\n“It’s like the judicial sphere is giving social licence so that anyone can think or do anything.”\n\nFriday’s hearing came just weeks after a man pointed a revolver at Fernandez de Kirchner’s head amid a crowd of supporters who had rallied outside her Buenos Aires home in a show of support amid the corruption case. The attacker pulled the trigger, but the gun did not fire.\n\nThe assassination attempt drew widespread condemnation but it has had a negligible effect on the public’s opinion of Fernandez de Kirchner, with polls this month pegging her positive image rating at between 24 and 34 percent.\n\nDuring her address to the court, Fernandez de Kirchner made a point of calling the people now accused in the assassination attempt the “material authors” – saying that “no one can think that that group planned” or “were the intellectual authors” of the attack.\n\nThe accused gunman, Fernando Andre Sabag Montiel, 35, has been charged with attempted murder, along with his 23-year-old girlfriend Brenda Uliarte. Two other people have also been arrested.\n\nThe case\n\nFriday marked the last opportunity for Fernandez de Kirchner to defend herself before a panel of three judges in Buenos Aires.\n\nShe is charged with leading “an illicit organisation” and “aggravated fraudulent administration” in a case that covers a period between 2003 and 2015 during which she and her late husband, Nestor Kirchner, occupied the presidency of Argentina.\n\nProsecutors say that during her years at the helm, from 2007 to 2015, Fernandez de Kirchner illegally helped direct state funds into public roadworks contracts that were awarded to companies owned by an associate of the Kirchners in the southern province of Santa Cruz, which is their political stronghold.\n\nA total of 51 contracts were awarded to companies owned by Lazaro Baez, who is among 12 other people charged in the roadworks case. Baez was convicted of money laundering in a separate case last year.\n\n“When Nestor Kirchner took over the presidency of the nation, and later his wife … they installed and maintained within the national and provincial administration of Santa Cruz, one of the most extraordinary corruption matrixes that unfortunately and sadly ever existed in the country,” lead prosecutor Diego Luciani said in his remarks last month.\n\nEstimating that $926m was defrauded by the state, Luciani has asked the court to sentence Fernandez de Kirchner to 12 years in prison for her role in the alleged scheme and to impose a lifetime ban on her holding public office.\n\nThat triggered huge demonstrations in support of her outside her home, including the one during which the assassination attempt took place.\n\nPolitical implications\n\nIn court on Friday, Carlos Beraldi, Fernandez de Kirchner’s lawyer, went through the allegations made by prosecutors that he said are not backed up by the facts.\n\nUsing witness testimony from the trial, he refuted claims that road works were not completed, overpriced or delayed. He also said the cost of the alleged fraud was not a serious estimate. “Cristina Kirchner never issued any directive related to the works under investigation,” said Beraldi.\n\nFernandez de Kirchner said the prosecutors in this case should be investigated for the “incredible lies” that they propagated, adding that allegations that she headed up an illicit organisation are illogical and unconstitutional. “We were elected by the people. We can never be an illicit association,” she said.\n\nA ruling in the case could come as soon as December, or early next year, when Argentina will have presidential elections.\n\n“This case is important because of the political actors at play,” Argentinian political analyst Ricardo Rouvier told Al Jazeera, noting that Fernandez de Kirchner continues to be the leader of a political minority in Argentina that is nonetheless “very active”.\n\nThe implications for next year’s federal election are not yet clear, he added. “We’ll have to see what the outcome is.”",

    "Argentina: Demonstrators rally for VP after assassination attempt": "Thousands demonstrate in Buenos Aires, hours after Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner survived gun attack outside her home.\n\nThousands of people have gathered in Argentina’s capital Buenos Aires to show solidarity and support for Vice President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, who survived an assassination attempt outside her home.\n\nThe show of support on Friday came less than 24 hours after a man attempted to fire a gun at Fernandez de Kirchner, who previously served as the country’s president, at close range amid a crowd of her supporters.\n\nThe gunman, who was standing a few steps from the vice president, pulled the trigger on Thursday evening, but the weapon did not fire.\n\nAuthorities have yet to determine a motive for the attack, but a suspect – identified as 35-year-old Brazilian Fernando Andres Sabag Montiel – has been arrested.\n\n“Luckily the bullet didn’t come out because the consequences could have been much worse,” said Florencia Suera, a 22-year-old worker in Buenos Aires.\n\nOscar Delupi, 64, a railway worker in the capital, blamed political divisions for the violence. “It’s crazy, society has already lost its temper a little, the message of hate … is becoming more and more fierce in those weak-minded people who opt for a crazy thing like an attack,” he said.\n\nThe incident has sent shockwaves across Argentina and the wider region, and spurred condemnation from world leaders on Friday.\n\nIt also comes as Fernandez de Kirchner faces corruption charges, which she denies, and as the South American nation is reeling from deepening political polarisation and an economic crisis fuelled by skyrocketing inflation.\n\nReporting from Buenos Aires, journalist Natalio Cosoy described the demonstration backing Fernandez de Kirchner as “massive”.\n\n“The emotions are high, but it’s also a relief for them the fact that [the assassination] didn’t succeed, so there are mixed feelings … shock and relief,” Cosoy told Al Jazeera.\n\nHe added that the vice president’s supporters have been trying to come together in her defence since before the assassination attempt to reject the corruption charges against her, which they view as politically motivated.\n\nOscar Parrilli, a senator and ally of the vice president, told local radio that Fernandez de Kircher was okay but in shock following the attack. “Luckily, she has her spirit intact,” he said.\n\nJavier Farje, a political analyst, said the attempt on Fernandez de Kirchner’s life may increase her popularity.\n\n“The video shows really clearly a gun against my head,” Farje told Al Jazeera. “The shock in Argentina society is so huge that it might help her ironically to regain some of the popularity that she might have lost among people who do not agree with her.”\n\nArgentina’s President Alberto Fernandez, who is not related to Fernandez de Kirchner, called the assassination attempt the “most serious event” the country has endured since its return to democracy in 1983 after years of military rule.\n\n“Cristina is still alive because – for a reason that is yet to be confirmed technically – the weapon that had five bullets did not fire despite being triggered,” the president said. He also declared Friday a national holiday in defence of democracy.\n\nCosoy, the journalist, said Fernandez has stressed a message of unity.\n\n“This is a very polarised country in political terms … So I think now [Fernandez] is trying to tackle that issue and speaking about trying to come together and lower the levels of aggression in public speech,” Cosoy said.\n\nThe left-wing Fernandez de Kirchner served two terms as president between 2007 and 2015.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken condemned the failed attack on Fernandez de Kirchner on Friday, saying that Washington stands “with the Argentine government and people in rejecting violence and hate”.\n\nMexico’s left-wing President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador also condemned the attack as “deplorable”, calling Fernandez de Kirchner’s survival “miraculous”.",
    "Argentina eyes $664 million for fighter jets": "SANTIAGO, Chile — Argentina’s government has told lawmakers that it plans to spend about $684 million to procure new fighter jets and build related infrastructure.\n\nThe information, provided last week in response to questions from the Defense Committee within the Deputies Chamber, came from the chief of the Cabinet of Ministers, Juan Manzur, and the office of Defense Minister Jorge Taiana.\n\nThe budget, included in the current year’s Decree 88/22, calls for the allocation of $664 million to buy combat aircraft, plus an additional $20 million for the new infrastructure needed to support their operation.\n\nThe answers received by the Deputies Chamber defines the aircraft as “a multirole fighter jet fitted with an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, an in-flight refueling system compatible with the tanker aircraft currently in the inventory of the Argentine Air Force, a tactical data link and an electronic warfare defensive suite.”\n\nAircraft with an open-architecture design would be required to integrate weapons and systems of any origin, but legal requirements demand that no British-made or -designed system, subsystem or component may exist in the purchased aircraft. The ban aims to mitigate pressure from the United Kingdom, which, since the Falklands war in 1982, has limited or banned the supply of spare parts and material for military hardware to Argentina.\n\nThe U.K. effort has hindered maintenance and the operational capacity of platforms and weapons in Argentina’s inventory, and in recent years played against the South American nation’s options to buy secondhand Dassault Mirage F1, Saab Gripen and Korea Aerospace Industries FA-50 jets.\n\nThe answers sent to lawmakers also mention the aircraft types already assessed and under consideration as potential solutions, including the JF-17, which is jointly produced by China and Pakistan; the F-16, made by American firm Lockheed Martin; the Tejas, by India’s Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd.; and the Russian Mikoyan MiG-35.\n\nThe Tejas could prove cost-effective, but its original radar is partly of British origin, its in-flight refueling system is of British design and its ejection seat comes from British company Martin-Baker. While the radar could be replaced, swapping out the in-flight refueling system would be more complex, as it might require structural intervention. And replacing the ejection seat would require an expensive redesign of the cabin.\n\nA senior military officer, speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid workplace retaliation, said of the four aircraft listed by the government that it’s unlikely Argentina will choose the MiG-35 because of “political and logistical” reasons. The source felt similarly about the Tejas “because to replace components that can be vetoed by the British would be very expensive, beyond what the Argentine government is willing and can spend.”\n\n“The Argentine Air Force would rather prefer the [Lockheed Martin] F-16, but the U.S. government does not help with it, as it is only willing to authorize a sale under very restrictive conditions,” the officer told Defense News.\n\n“An Argentine request for allowance to integrate Rafael’s Derby BVR missile, as well as other Israeli weapons and systems, in the F-16 was made around a month ago,” the officer added. “No answer has come from Washington, and the silence sounds like a no here in Buenos Aires. Many here see these objections to the sale of AMRAAM and the integration of Israeli weapons as a product of British pressure or influence on the U.S. authorities.\n\n“All of this plays in the favor of the procurement of the Chinese JF-17/FC-1 fighter jet, a machine that has no British components or parts, not even a screw.”\n\nMeanwhile, Israel Aerospace Industries is launching a new campaign in Buenos Aires to promote the option of buying refurbished, upgraded Kfir jets.\n\nRetired Argentine Army Col. Guillermo Lafferriere, now a Buenos Aires-based independent defense analyst, is skeptical about Argentina’s intentions and commitment to procure a new combat jet.\n\n“They can hold long negotiations, can do several trips abroad to see offers, can even sign letters of intention short of contracts. [But] they have also powers to change the destination of approved budgets, so can take the funds for something else,” he told Defense News. “The people today in office in the government spent decades describing the military as criminals, as well as neglecting the armed forces while saying they are an unnecessary waste. Their voters believe that, and will get enraged if they now start spending in military hardware and getting international loans for it, even if it is a small amount like this for combat aircraft.”\n\nJosé Higuera is the South America correspondent for Defense News, covering South American and Latin American affairs.",

    "Argentina’s pensioners suffer under weight of soaring inflation": "With inflation continuing to rise in Argentina, many struggle to pay for essentials like food and medicine.\n\nBuenos Aires, Argentina – Villa Lugano, a collection of large social housing complexes in Argentina’s capital, was founded in the 1900s by a Swiss man who dreamt of building a neighbourhood that would compare with his home in Lugano, Switzerland.\n\nToday, it has become a symbol of the country’s working class – and it’s where I recently met Stella Maris Acosta and Walmiran Aramburu, two pensioners living off the minimum monthly instalment of about $170 each.\n\nIn a country where the monthly inflation rate has hit approximately 7 percent, their income is not enough to survive on. Stella Maris and Walmiran live in a modest apartment and they are struggling to pay the bills.\n\n“The only dream I had was owning a home and now look at us,” Stella Maris told me. “I am still paying for the mortgage, utility services, plus all the medicines we need – we cannot buy enough food.”\n\nShe then stood up and went to the refrigerator, proudly displaying some of the vegetables that she said she picks out of the rubbish, drops into vinegar and cleans up before eating. “People throw away food but it can be preserved and used,” said Stella Maris. “I can turn this tomato into sauce, bake it and other things.”\n\nArgentina is an agricultural powerhouse that produces food for 400 million people – yet amid soaring inflation and the daily struggles of people like Stella Maris and Walmiran, many here say the country’s ruling class has failed them over and over again.\n\nPeople are used to living with high inflation; it’s been a problem for decades. But with the rate expected to hit 100 percent by the end of 2022, Argentines are hoping for miracles.\n\nUnions are strong and they are pushing for wages to keep up with inflation. This year, deals have been reached for 65-percent salary increases and that’s one of the reasons why the government is still in control. There is anger, yes, and the government has lost support. But they are still in power.\n\nThe problem is that pensioners – who number about 7 million, of which 86 percent are getting the minimum amount every month – can rarely take to the streets and demand a better income.\n\n“Inflation, what it does is that you pay the new prices with an old salary. It happens to all workers,” Eugenio Semino, a public defender for the elderly in Buenos Aires, told Al Jazeera.\n\nHe explained that even though labour unions have agreed to salary increases, that jump is already outpaced by the projected inflation, which “will be close to 100 [percent]”.\n\nArgentina’s government knows there is a big battle ahead over inflation. The problem is that until recently, President Alberto Fernandez and Vice President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner could not agree on the antidote to fight it.\n\nAlberto Fernandez had been trying to reach an agreement with the International Monetary Fund to cut down on subsidies and government spending, while Fernandez de Kirchner opposed many of his policies and insisted that inflation needed to be fought differently. But when she was president of Argentina until 2014, she, too, was unable to find a solution.\n\nNow, Sergio Massa is the new minister of the economy – the third to take up the post in August alone after a string of government shakeups.\n\nA seasoned politician with presidential ambitions, he has promised to jumpstart the troubled economy. Massa just came back from Washington, DC, where he made a desperate attempt to find investors and support for many of his policies. But whether his plan succeeds remains to be seen.\n\nMeanwhile, Argentina’s pensioners continue to struggle under the weight of the crisis.\n\nStella Maris has been working since she was 15. She has worked as a maid and a nurse, but now suffers from diabetes. Walmiran, who came to Argentina from Uruguay in the 1970s, worked as a doorman all his life. He, too, has health problems now, including epilepsy.\n\nDespite these challenges, Stella Maris and Walmiran still go out every day to try to make an extra living. They search rubbish bins for bronze, copper, aluminium, and food. If they are lucky, they can make an extra $80 every month by selling the recyclable materials.\n\nThey say Argentina’s political class has failed them. They are forced to take to the streets to survive as inflation continues to soar. But they are not humiliated by it. They say it’s a job and for now, it’s the only thing they can do to help them make it until the end of the month.",
    "The Many Trials of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner": "“When I defend the other, I’m defending myself,” said Hebe de Bonafini, one of the co-founders of the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo, in a recorded address . “Today, the other is Cristina.”\n\nLess than 24 hours before, a man brandished a gun in Fernández de Kirchner’s face and pulled the trigger while she was greeting supporters outside her apartment in the upscale neighborhood of Recoleta; miraculously, the gun did not fire. Fernando André Sabag Montiel, 35, was quickly arrested and charged in the assassination attempt. Now, alongside officials from the ruling Frente de Todos (“Everyone’s Front”) party, the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo , who garnered international renown for their defiance of Argentina’s military dictatorship a generation ago, were gathering in front of the Casa Rosada, the country’s presidential office, like white blood cells fighting an infection.\n\nOn Sept. 2, a van carrying several gray-haired women in white head scarves inched toward the presidential palace in downtown Buenos Aires, a sea of bodies swelling all around it. Thousands of people had gathered in the capital and across Argentina to express their solidarity with the country’s vice president, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, and to demonstrate their commitment to democracy more broadly.\n\nOn Sept. 2, a van carrying several gray-haired women in white head scarves inched toward the presidential palace in downtown Buenos Aires, a sea of bodies swelling all around it.

Fernández de Kirchner currently faces up to 12 years in prison and a lifetime ban from holding public office for allegedly directing construction contracts to a personal contact as part of the corruption scandal “La Causa Vialidad” (The Road Case). Meanwhile, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and the onset of the war in Ukraine, inflation in July soared 70 percent over 2021, with some economists predicting that number will reach 90 percent by the end of the year. These numbers are staggering even for a country that has grown accustomed to economic upheaval in recent decades. As a result, the center-left Frente de Todos has seen its approval numbers plummet: One recent poll indicates it has the support of less than 20 percent of the population.\n\nCecilia, a 38-year-old lecturer on international political economy who was among the masses in the capital, asked not to provide her last name, later saying she was “scared” that an extreme right-wing movement may be on the rise in Argentina. “I’m not a Kirchnerista”—a supporter of the vice president or her late husband, Néstor Kirchner, who served as president of Argentina from 2003 to 2007—“but I still think it’s important to be here,” she said. “This is not an outlier. This is the consequence of a global process of polarization brought on by economic distress.”\n\nFernández de Kirchner has called La Causa Vialidad a “media judicial firing squad.” Whether she has been unjustly persecuted depends almost entirely on one’s political orientation, as the former president and first lady remains perhaps the country’s most polarizing figure. Regardless, these kinds of investigations raise pressing questions about how judiciaries in Latin America often embolden the forces of reaction. And as cases like Vialidad in Argentina and the sweeping criminal probe known as Operation Car Wash in Brazil make clear, the consequences can be far-reaching and unexpected.\n\nThe latest charges against Fernández de Kirchner date back to the early aughts. According to a federal prosecutor, the then-senator for Santa Cruz began directing state funds to a close friend and associate via public works contracts. Nearly half of those contracts were never completed, and the money was allegedly routed through a shell company over a 12-year period. In 2019, a federal court sentenced one of Fernández de Kirchner’s co-defendants and former ministers, José Lopez, to six years in prison for stashing $9 million and an automatic weapon in a Buenos Aires convent.\n\nShortly after oral arguments in Fernández de Kirchner’s case began in August, Presidents Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico, Gustavo Petro of Colombia, and Luis Arce of Bolivia issued a joint statement with Argentina’s President Alberto Fernández (no relation to the vice president) denouncing her “unjustifiable judicial persecution.” This statement followed a separate missive from the Fernández government earlier that month deriding the judiciary’s use of “lawfare”—a legal means of persecution by which the courts can delegitimize a politician and subvert the will of the people.\n\nIn Argentina, however, lawfare is in the eye of the beholder.\n\n“It’s important to remember that this is not the first case of corruption involving the administrations of Nestor and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner ,” said Ignacio Labaqui, a professor of Latin American politics and theory at the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina. “I can’t speak to the case against her; that’s for the judges to decide. But she has the ability to appeal to higher courts, including the Supreme Court.”\n\nFernández de Kirchner is no stranger to scandal, as Labaqui notes. In addition to Vialidad, the Peronist firebrand faces charges stemming from a separate investigation known as “La Causa de los Cuadernos” (The Notebook Case). While the courts dismissed two charges against her in 2019 and another in 2021, the Cuadernos probe, which centers around alleged bribes paid to public officials in both Kirchner administrations, is expected to go to trial. But since then-President Fernández de Kirchner’s failed attempt to reform the justice system in 2013, the motivations of the judiciary in pursuing these probes remain murky.\n\n“That was really the opening salvo in what has become an open war [on Cristina Fernández de Kirchner],” said María Esperanza Casullo, a political scientist and professor at the National University of Río Negro. “Anti-corruption probes have evolved into a tool to be wielded against leftist or national popular governments, and I don’t think there’s a lot of controversy in saying this. Maybe there’s compelling evidence against Kirchner in this trial, but if you look at the totality of these cases, it’s hard to escape the notion that there’s a wider political intention here.”\n\nNeither are the circumstances surrounding the Vialidad and Cuadernos probes unique to Argentina. In 2014, a money laundering investigation in Curitiba, Brazil, that was later dubbed Operação Lava Jato (Operation Car Wash) eventually came to enmesh broad swaths of the country’s political establishment, including members of the center-left Workers’ Party and the center-right Brazilian Social Democracy Party, along with officials at the state-owned oil company Petrobras.\n\nMore significantly, Operation Car Wash led to the trial and subsequent conviction of former Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on charges that he offered public works contracts in exchange for a beachfront apartment in the small coastal city of Guarujá. That conviction was ultimately voided, but not before Lula was prevented from running for office in 2018, paving the way for the far-right Jair Bolsonaro’s victory. (Sergio Moro, the federal judge who spearheaded the investigation, received a post in the Bolsonaro administration, while Lula was sent to prison.)\n\n“Argentina and Brazil are similar in the sense that, like most Latin American democracies, corruption is part of how the game is played,” said Eduardo Mello, an assistant professor of politics and international relations at the Fundação Getulio Vargas. “It’s not a left or a right or a center thing. Corruption is integral to the political system. These kinds of probes happen under all presidents, but they tend to move forward when an administration is deeply unpopular.”\n\n“It’s not that lawfare doesn’t exist,” he added. “It’s that it doesn’t have an explicit political orientation.”\n\nRecent history would appear to bear out Mello’s thesis. Although Lula was not in office at the outset of Operation Car Wash, the investigation gained momentum as the economy contracted under his successor, Dilma Rousseff. Similarly, the case against Fernández de Kirchner has advanced during a Fernández administration buckling beneath rampant inflation and several global catastrophes. Whereas Lula was disqualified from the 2018 election in Brazil, Fernández de Kirchner would be allowed to hold public office until she has exhausted the appeals process. Still, it seems inevitable that the trial and others like it will tarnish the public’s perception of the vice president, even if the full extent of the damage may prove difficult to assess. In the lower house of the Argentine Congress, at least one member of the opposition, Francisco Sánchez, has called for Fernández de Kirchner to receive the death penalty—a call that he has since retracted. Others have even intimated that the assassination attempt was staged.\n\n“What we’re seeing is an asymmetric radicalization in Argentina, with a far right confronting a more moderate left,” said Ernesto Semán, a political scientist and Latin American historian at the University of Bergen in Norway. “The right is [embracing] more violent and vitriolic rhetoric against individual leaders but also against the very idea of populism, which it treats as intrinsically criminal or corrupt. All of these elements come together in this latest assassination attempt.”\n\nThis month, police have arrested four people, including the apparent would-be assassin Sabag Montiel’s 23-year-old girlfriend, Brenda Uliarte, for their alleged roles in the plot. An investigation into their possible ties to far-right organizations is ongoing, and the probe has already been marred by a possible breakdown in the chain of custody, but a few things about the alleged gunman are known: He bears a neo-Nazi tattoo on his elbow, and he’s a virulent anti-Kirchnerist who has openly railed against her political movement’s efforts to expand social benefits for the poor. In the aftermath of the botched assassination, authorities in the nearby city of La Plata also raided the so-called Kyle Rittenhouse Cultural Center—named for the teenager who shot and killed two Black Lives Matter protesters in Kenosha, Wisconsin—after one of its patrons praised Sabag Montiel on Facebook.\n\n“There might be 150 people in Argentina who know who Kyle Rittenhouse is,” Casullo, the political scientist, said. “What’s interesting to me is how this global flow of [right-wing] memes and information combines with elements of each country. In Argentina, it’s anti-Kirchnerism. In Brazil or Chile, maybe it’s something else.”\n\nSince the fall of the military junta in 1983, Argentine democracy has proved remarkably resilient, withstanding multiple political and economic crises. Yet if Brazil’s descent into authoritarianism offers any kind of instruction, it’s that nothing is guaranteed.\n\n“We have a lot of problems in Argentina, but one that we didn’t have was the fear that someone could be hurt while speaking in public,” Casullo added. “The ability to speak face-to-face with the people is a very important part of doing politics in the country, especially for Peronists. If that were to change, it would be incredibly corrosive.”\n\nOn the morning of the march, Nora Cortiñas, another co-founder of the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo, issued a warning to Radio Provincia. “It’s not possible to tolerate this hatred, nor this poison that is released by the right,” she said. That rage “will keep increasing between now and 2023.”",
    "In Argentina, Returning the Country’s Remote Landscapes to Their Wildest States": "An hour before sunset, the Iberá Wetlands rustle to life as if cued by a conductor. Capybaras—large anvil-headed rodents—snuffle through the grass, raucous lapwings crisscross the sky, and three tawny, web-footed marsh deer wade along the edge of the swamp, which only two decades earlier had been a lifeless cattle watering hole.\n\nAs I amble by on horseback, our guide, Mingo Gonzalez, who names a few of Iberá's 370 bird species along the path—tiger heron, bare-faced ibis, strange-tailed tyrant—admits he wasn't all that well-versed in wildlife as a gaucho who grew up in the nearby village of Colonia Carlos Pellegrini. Back then, nature wasn't so much revered as ignored—or feared. Previous generations used to hunt jaguars to protect their cattle, selling the skins to fur traders. Although the big cat symbolized strength among the Indigenous Guarani of Corrientes province, the last one was seen here in the 1950s.\n\nRead more about the Future of Travel here.\n\nA garza mora, or cocoi heron, a bird endemic to the lowlands of Argentina Alistair Taylor-Young\n\nWe dismount in a savanna, where we find that staff at our lodge, Rincón del Socorro, have set a table with bottles of Argentine Malbec and a platter of local meats and cheeses. With the cracked yolk of the sun trickling behind a skeletal acacia tree, you could swear you were on safari in Africa—a resemblance that may be more than a wine-fueled illusion, given the Pangaea theory that South America and Africa once formed a supercontinent that broke apart more than 200 million years ago. From the small plane we flew in on from Posadas, we watched the landscape tip over from cattle ranches to a flat mosaic of floating grass islands that look strikingly like Botswana's Okavango Delta, though at 1.8 million acres, the Iberá Wetlands are only about half the size. More recently, Africa has inspired the most wide-reaching conservation effort ever in Argentina, a country notorious for the ravages of its beef industry. This has led to the restoration of massive swathes of land into flourishing, biodiverse ecosystems, sustained by income generated by tourism. This model—in which new wildernesses are secured with the creation of local jobs in ecotourism—is being adapted in South America on a huge scale by the foundations Rewilding Argentina and Rewilding Chile, heirs to the legacy of Tompkins Conservation. Starting in the 1990s, American husband-and-wife activists Doug and Kris Tompkins, a cofounder of The North Face and Patagonia's former CEO, respectively, started buying up strategic tracts of land to protect across the two countries; the NGOs spun off in 2015, after Doug was killed in a kayaking accident.\n\nBetween them, the two organizations are responsible for 15 million protected acres, which are now being donated in stages to the public as national parks. Meanwhile, the foundations are putting lodges and visitors centers in place, training rangers and guides, and reintroducing or stabilizing keystone species. Here in Argentina, where nature tourism is still in its infancy, Rewilding's long-term vision is to create a circuit of parks, from the Amazon-like El Impenetrable and Iberá Wetlands in the far north, where I've started my trip, to high-plateau Parque Patagonia, more than 1,000 miles south, where I'll head in a few days' time.",

    "Messi's best Argentina side? Super-charged Brazil? South America's World Cup-bound teams in action": "South America's four World Cup-bound squads -- Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Ecuador -- were in all in action on Friday as they prepare for Qatar. While Brazil and Argentina had looked the part of tournament favourites, Uruguay and Ecuador continue to be works in progress.\n\nTaking into account their performances, we answer a key question for each CONMEBOL side as their preparation for the game's biggest stage continues.\n\nAre we prepared for a super-attacking Brazil?\n\nBrazil coach Tite already has a Plan A and a Plan B -- and in an exhilarating first half against Ghana in Le Havre, France, he unleashed an ultra-attacking Plan C, which probably worked even better than he had hoped.\n\nOver the past year, his team have grown accustomed to playing with two wingers -- usually Raphinha on the right and Vinicius Junior on the left, with Neymar floating as a false nine, linking up with attacking midfielder Lucas Paqueta. The variation has been to include Richarlison as a centre forward, dropping one of the wingers and using Paqueta cutting in from one of the flanks.\n\nBut what if there was a way to have both a centre forward and two wingers? Now there is. This time Paqueta fills the role of Fred, dropping deeper to play from central midfield. With him to the right of Casemiro and Neymar to the left, there is room for a front three ahead of them. It means that Paqueta has to put in a defensive shift, but so does everyone. As soon as they lose possession, Brazil press collectively to win it back.\n\nGhana found it hard to work up any rhythm, and the few times they managed to beat the press, the imperious Marquinhos was on hand to use his pace and awareness to snuff out the danger. Brazil were on their way to the 3-0 win -- and could have been more -- at the end of a first half that, against respectable opponents, was almost absurdly one-sided. Brazil's collection of attacking talent passed holes in Ghana's 4-1-4-1 formation, and front-loading the team did not leave the team looking vulnerable.\n\nThis new formation will not work for all situations against all opponents. But it is an option that Brazil have added to their repertoire -- one that will surely send a shiver down their World Cup rivals.\n\nIs this Messi's best Argentina side?\n\nOn its own, Argentina's 3-0 win over this Honduras side hardly qualifies anyone for greatness. But 34 games unbeaten tells its own story. And what was striking was the utterly predictable nature of the Argentine triumph in Miami.\n\nHonduras brought back memories of an outclassed boxer coming up against Muhammad Ali in his prime. They never came close to laying a glove on Argentina, while all night their heads were being snapped back as, patiently and with purpose, Argentina jabbed away, pulling them out of position and setting them up for the big punch. Some might recall the 2006 side, eliminated on penalties by Germany in the quarterfinal, while a teenage Lionel Messi sat on the substitutes bench, unable to do anything about it.\n\nThat team revolved around playmaker Juan Román Riquelme. The focus of this team is a little higher up the field. With that midfield trio -- Leandro Paredes playing the first pass forward with quality, Rodrigo De Paul adding drive and changes of rhythm and Giovani Lo Celso stroking the ball around with rare precision -- Messi is brought into the game closer to the opposing goal, in a zone of the field from where he can do something to unlock the opposing defence.\n\nFor much of his previous time in the national team, Argentina were a shambles. Plan A was to give the ball to Messi and hope. Plan B was to give the ball to Messi and hope. And there was no Plan C. Not now. This is a side with an almost hypnotic quality about its possession-based game -- they took the match away from Honduras in the first 15 minutes. It is a team that functions, and one which, in his fifth World Cup, might even give Messi his best chance of winning the competition.\n\nWill Diego Alonso's first loss unsettle Uruguay?\n\nSince taking over as Uruguay coach at the end of last year, Diego Alonso had only known victory, plus a goalless draw against the United States in a June friendly when he fielded a reserve side. He has now tasted defeat after his side lost 1-0 to Iran in Vienna on Friday. As he said after the game, there are no grounds for despair but he does have food for thought.\n\nAgainst an opponent who dropped back deep and looked for the counterattack, Uruguay defended well enough with a couple of centre-backs who were making their debuts -- an injury crisis in the position that got worse when Ronald Araujo limped off in the opening minute. There were clear advantages in fielding a pair of full-backs who could push forward -- it allowed the wide men in the 4-3-3 system to get into the penalty area. This was especially important for Darwin Nunez, whose lack of an effective left foot was a problem when he was out on that flank. Nunez is surely more of a threat as a centre forward, and if there is only space for one in the team the Alonso could have a big decision to take.\n\nLuis Suarez looked well short of his best and missed some of the team's clearest chances. Uruguay ended up playing 4-4-2 with both Nunez and Suarez -- a switch which, at the other end, may have cost them the game (Edinson Cavani is not with the squad as he settles in with new side Valencia). Uruguay played most of the match with a trio in the centre of midfield, Matias Vecino holding while Rodrigo Bentancur and Federico Valverde looked for space between the Iranian lines.\n\nFor the last 20 minutes, Vecino was sacrificed as Alonso changed his system -- and the only goal of the game soon followed, the move originating in the space that Vecino was no longer protecting. Uruguay are surely at their best with three in the middle, which does not make it easy for Alonso to squeeze in all of his attacking talent.\n\nWhere will Ecuador's goals come from in Qatar?\n\nCoaches are always pleased with clean sheets, so after three games without conceding in June, Ecuador boss Gustavo Alfaro could take some comfort from a 0-0 draw with Saudi Arabia in the Spanish town of Murcia. But the lack of goals at the other end was a disappointment to the region's sizeable Ecuadorian community and a cause for concern for the coach. True, his team have now gone four games without conceding -- although Japan on Tuesday promise to provide a stiffer test.\n\nBut in these four matches, Ecuador have only found the back of the net twice. There were times in qualification when Ecuador were a free scoring side, but the goals have dried up. Alfaro could perhaps take some comfort from the way that his men created chances in different ways against the Saudis -- thrusts of Gonzalo Plata from the right, crosses of Pervis Estupinan from the left, through aggressive pressing in midfield, from set pieces played into the box or long balls over the top of the defence.\n\nBut the team lacks a cutting edge. Ecuador 's all-time top scorer is the veteran Enner Valencia. He is probably happier cutting in from the left than operating through the middle, as he did in this game. And his goals tend to come in spurts. Alfaro has had a look at options in the centre forward position, but probably can do no better than the rangy Michael Estrada, the side's top scorer in qualification, who came off the bench against the Saudis but is surely the favourite to lead the line in Qatar. All but one of his six goals came in the first half of the qualifiers, and Ecuador need him to rediscover his best form.",
    "Argentina looks to open new route to the sea for foreign trade": "José María Lojo, the president of the Port of La Plata to the south of Buenos Aires, agrees: “I see the Magdalena Channel as strategic and extremely important for Argentina. I believe it is a route that is necessary for the integration of navigation systems in the La Plata Basin, offering the possibility of a competitive and efficient alternative in the transport of goods.”\n\nFor Lojo, without this route, “the system is incomplete and inefficient”. This inefficiency lies, he says, in the greater distances that all ships coming to or from southern Argentina must travel, at great logistical expense due to frequent waiting times – between one and seven days – and costs as high as US$40,000 a day, because there is only a single one-way channel.\n\n“These waiting vessels receive services from Uruguay: water, foodstuffs, spare parts, technicians, waste removal and more. All this is estimated to be in the order of 150 million dollars a year,” Lojo explains. “The Magdalena Channel would serve to reduce waiting times, but if there were any, if a part of these ships were to wait near the Argentinean coasts, we would add a productive activity to supply the ships, for 30 or 40 million dollars a year.”\n\nFor the Port of La Plata president, the Magdalena Channel will allow Argentine producers to “improve their competitiveness” and consumers to “have lower prices” due to more efficient logistics.\n\nDoubts from the private sector\n\nAlfredo Sesé, technical secretary of the transport, infrastructure and waterway commission at the Rosario Stock Exchange (BCR), an organisation that brings together the main representatives of Argentine agribusiness, recognises that a modified Magdalena Channel would be beneficial for cabotage – domestic goods transport – to or from the south of Argentina, and for bulk carriers that have to deliver their cargo to the port of Bahía Blanca, in the south of the Province of Buenos Aires.\n\nWe are not opposed to any work, but we believe that there are other priorities, such as roads and railways\n\nHowever, in the BCR’s assessment, savings through the Magdalena Channel would be limited. “More than 90% of Argentina’s flour and oil production comes out of the port hub of the Greater Rosario area, whose destinations would not require navigation through this channel to reach the ocean, as they are heading north and the Magdalena points south,” Sesé says. “Its impact on this production would be nil.”\n\nElsewhere, Argentina already positioned itself as the world’s leading exporter of soybean meal and oil during the 2020-21 season. Amid this already high output, Sesé emphasises that for the agribusiness sector, the Magdalena Channel is “a multi-million dollar project that is not one of the sector's priorities”.\n\n“We are not opposed to any work, but we believe that there are other priorities, such as roads that require maintenance to avoid accidents and lower costs, all of which have been waiting for years, and there is a need for investment in railways, too,” the BCR secretary says.\n\nComings and goings\n\nA number of precursors to the Magdalena Channel project date back to the early years of the century, but it was in 2013, during the second government of now vice-president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, that it gained concrete momentum: the route and width were defined and dredging was planned.\n\nThe proposed work obtained Uruguay’s approval in early 2016 under the Comisión Administradora del Río de la Plata (CARP), the binational body that regulates the shared use of the river, but the initiative became paralysed during the administration of former president Mauricio Macri.\n\nIt was not until 2021, with current incumbent Alberto Fernández in power, that the initiative regained momentum. A “special temporary executing unit” for the Magdalena Channel was created to call for tenders for the dredging, signalling and maintenance works. An environmental impact study was approved without objections the same year.\n\nThe work was included in the draft budget for 2022, put forward by the government last year. However, since the budget was not approved, the initiative has once again been stalled, this time due to lack of funds. It is now expected that the call for tenders will be made at the beginning of next year, once the 2023 budget is approved.\n\nThe international tender is expected to attract the interest of major players in the global dredging market, such as Belgium’s Jan de Nul, which has been operating on the Paraná-Paraguay waterway since 1995, and China’s CCCC Shanghai Dredging Company, which has experience in dredging the port of Mar del Plata on the Atlantic coast, and the Martín García channel further up the Río de la Plata, among other companies.",

    "Winter drought rolls into third La Niña for Argentina": "THE PROSPECT of another La Niña weather pattern does not bode well for Argentina’s 2022-23 season grain production, especially following one of the worst winter droughts in three decades. Every La Niña is different, and crop production effects are not predictable, but entering spring with an extremely poor soil-moisture profile and the days beginning to heat up is not a good start. While there is still plenty of time for the required rains to arrive for the summer-crop planting season, it will make it extremely difficult for winter-crop production to recover.\n\nCrop conditions in Argentina appear to be going from bad to worse with much of the country’s farming zones facing the worst drought in around 30 years. Wheat farmers in some regions are reportedly abandoning hope of any production this season, and the summer-crop plant is stalled while farmers wait for sufficient rain.\n\nSeptember announces the start of spring in Argentina, and it usually heralds wetter weather to finish the winter crop and plant the summer crop. However, the forecast for a third straight La Niña weather pattern in 2022 is expected to limit precipitation for the balance of the year. Typically, La Niña leads to hot and dry conditions for Argentina.\n\nThe likelihood that the cooling of the equatorial Pacific will linger through October has risen to 97 per cent, according to the latest forecast from the United States Climate Prediction Centre. And the chances of La Niña hanging around through to the end of January are now 80pc.\n\nArid, not rosy\n\nThis would spell disaster for grain production in Argentina this season, with concerns growing amongst industry participants, analysts and meteorologists that Argentina will see a repeat of the 2008-09 season, commonly referred to as the “great drought”. The arid conditions throughout winter and early spring have also led to a string of frosts in recent weeks, but they are too early to have a huge impact, and losses appear to be limited at this stage.\n\nThe Buenos Aires Grain Exchange (BAGE) released its latest crop update on September 15, and the picture it painted was not rosy. More than one-third of the wheat area, or 34pc, was in the poor-to-very poor crop condition category. This was up from 26pc just a week earlier and 22pc at the same time last season. Only 15pc of the wheat area made the good-to-excellent category, down from 17pc in the first week of September and 50pc in early September last year.\n\nThe soil-moisture data paints a similar picture, with 46pc of the wheat crop sitting in the poor-to-dry category against 35pc last week and 30pc in 2021-22. The wheat crops are so bad in some regions, particularly in the country’s north, that the crops are dying. In other areas, farmers are likely to spray them out and plant to summer crop if sufficient and timely spring rain arrives.\n\nArgentina is coming off record wheat production of 22.4 million tonnes (Mt) in the 2021-22 season. The harvested area was 6.7 million hectares giving an average yield of 3.34 tonnes per hectare. According to BAGE, the planted area is already back by 9pc to 6.1 million hectares, but it is yet to release a formal production estimate. The final wheat area from the Rosario Grains Exchange (BCR) was even lower at 5.9Mha.\n\nThe severity of this season’s drought and the current long-term forecast suggests a 20pc reduction in yield compared to last year is probably conservative. Nonetheless, that would be a yield of 2.67t/ha and would result in wheat production in the range of 15.8Mt, using the BCR area, to 16.3Mt if applied to the BAGE area. With domestic consumption running at around 6.4Mt and assuming no change to ending stocks, exports could be as low as 9.4Mt.\n\nThe team at the USDA still have their blinkers on, leaving Argentina’s September wheat production estimate unchanged at 19Mt. Local Argentinian forecasts have been under 18Mt for more than two months, and the crop has undoubtedly deteriorated in the intervening period. There will also be a significant export hole to plug, with the USDA expecting shipments of 13Mt in the 2022-23 marketing year.\n\nSummer-crop bleak\n\nThe corn-planting season has arrived for the Pampas plains of Argentina, but many of the row-cropping regions have seen little to no rain in more than four months. With Northern Hemisphere production issues in Europe and the United States, and reduced export volumes out of Ukraine, the global consumer is banking on big South American crops. As the world’s third-largest exporter of corn, Argentina is desperately hoping to cash in on the tightening supply outlook.\n\nBut Argentina needs to get its crop in the ground, and the chance of a timely plant for the early crop is not looking good. And it is not only lack of soil moisture that is the problem. It has also been a cold winter in Argentina, and below-normal temperatures have continued into early spring. This has slowed the rise in soil temperature to the desired 10 degrees Celsius planting threshold, further delaying the planting program.\n\nThe Argentinian corn crop is planted in two phases – the first in September and October and the second in December and January. Argentine farmers typically avoid planting corn in November, so the crop is not flowering in the hottest part of the summer. It also spreads production risk across the summer. The past two La Niña weather patterns pushed a larger-than-normal proportion of the crop into the second window, and this year is likely to be a repeat.\n\nPlanting of Argentina’s soybean crop generally begins later than corn, with seeding commencing in late October and running through to the end of December. The biggest concern is for the double-crop area. The late plant followed by cold conditions throughout the winter and early spring have slowed wheat development. This will ultimately delay maturity and harvest, pushing planting dates for the subsequent soybean crop back to late summer.",

    "Far-right group discussed killing Argentina’s vice-president, court hears": "A series of audio recordings in which members of an extremist far-right group talked openly about killing the vice-president, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, have been presented in court by Argentina’s intelligence agency.\n\nThe recordings were made just four days before she survived an assassination attempt. A handgun pointed only inches away from her face failed to go off as she arrived at her apartment building on the evening of 1 September surrounded by supporters.\n\nThe assailant, 35-year-old Fernando Sabag Montiel, was quickly subdued and is now under arrest.\n\nHis girlfriend, Brenda Uliarte, is accused of instigating Sabag Montiel. “I am going to send Cristina to be killed,” Uliarte wrote to her 21-year-old friend Agustina Díaz a few days before the attack, according to messages found on her phone.\n\nArgentina’s intelligence officials believe there may be a link between the conspirators and Federal Revolution, a far-right extremist group that openly discussed conducting a similar attack on 28 August.\n\nArgentina’s intelligence chief, Agustín Rossi, said the attempted assassination was carried out exactly as the audio recordings, posted to Twitter on 28 August, described.\n\n“A person infiltrated among the group of sympathisers who took advantage of the opportunity […] to carry out the criminal deed,” he told the press after the audio clips were presented to investigating judge María Eugenia Capuchetti. “There are right-wing extremist groups, the black sun tattooed on Sabag Montiel is a symbol used by many of these organizations,” Rossi added.\n\nSabag Montiel, Uliarte and Díaz, all now under arrest, have been identified in news camera footage outside the vice-president’s home, apparently scouting the area for at least nine days before the attack. Uliarte and Díaz have both been interrogated by the investigating court, with Uliarte likely being charged with attempted homicide. Confronted with the messages found on her mobile phone, Uliarte refused to answer questions, according to press reports.\n\n“I’m going to go with the gun and shoot Cristina,” Uliarte said in a message to her friend Díaz. “I’ve got the ovaries to do it, the problem is the old woman has security. I’m not bullshitting you. I’m putting together a group to go with torches, bombs, gun, everything. I’m going to be the liberator of Argentina.

    "Blue Sky Uranium to refine drill targets with field exploration program at Amarillo Grande Uranium-Vanadium Project in Argentina": "Blue Sky Uranium has the exclusive right to properties in two provinces in Argentina\n\nBlue Sky Uranium Corp has announced the launch of a comprehensive field exploration program at the Cateo Cuatro sector of its Amarillo Grande Uranium-Vanadium Project (AGP) in Argentina to refine drilling targets.\n\nAdditionally, the company said it has advanced the Ivana East target to the drill-testing stage. The Ivana East target is 10 kilometers (km) east of the Ivana deposit, and Cateo Cuatro is located 32 km to the southwest.\n\nThese targets have been prioritized by the company as part of its strategy to define additional uranium deposits within the 145 km long AGP. The targets were identified through an ongoing review and reinterpretation of over 15 years of geological data.\n\n\"These two targets show significant similarities to the geological environment present at our Ivana deposit, which it is advancing towards prefeasibility studies,” CEO Nikolaos Cacos said in a statement.\n\n“The definition of both targets represents the results of a persistent comprehensive exploration program along the district scale Amarillo Grande Project, and their location close to the Ivana Deposit may represent a potential for the discovery of a cluster of deposits.\"\n\nThe Cateo Cuatro target area was initially prospected in 2013, the company said, with preliminary mapping, auger drilling, and water sampling at the time. The recently launched comprehensive exploration program at Cateo Cuatro will include geological mapping, auger drilling, radiometric surveying, seismic and/or IP tomography surveys and reverse circulation (RC) drilling.\n\nThe Ivana East target was initially identified in 2012 through an airborne radiometric survey. Ivana East is ready for initial RC drill testing, and drilling at both targets will be carried out after the Cateo Cuatro fieldwork is complete.\n\nBlue Sky Uranium has the exclusive right to properties in two provinces in Argentina. The company's flagship Amarillo Grande Project was an in-house discovery of a new district that has the potential to be both a leading domestic supplier of uranium to the growing Argentine market and a new international market supplier.\n\nThe company is a member of the Grosso Group, a resource management group that has pioneered exploration in Argentina since 1993.\n\nContact Andrew Kessel at andrew.kessel@proactiveinvestors.com\n\nFollow him on Twitter @andrew_kessel",

    "Don’t take democracy for granted, warns director of Argentine junta film": "A failed assassination attempt this week on the Argentine vice-president has shown that democracy cannot be taken for granted, the director behind a courtroom drama about the trial of Argentina’s military junta has said.\n\nOpening at the Venice film festival on Saturday, Santiago Mitre’s Argentina 1985 follows the prosecutors who, despite death threats and enormous legal difficulties, brought members of Argentina’s 1976-83 military dictatorship to trial in 1985.\n\nThe trial is considered one of the most significant in modern history, and is the only time a democratic government has launched a large-scale judicial assault on a country’s former dictatorial rulers. The case proved a watershed for Argentina.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference before the premiere, Mitre said Thursday’s attack on vice-president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner in Buenos Aires, when an assailant’s gun failed to discharge, was a “horrible act that we never thought could happen because we believed that the trial of 1985 had put an end to the idea of using violence to resolve political conflict”.\n\nHis film, he added, “has taken on a vitality we did not see coming”.\n\nPolice arrested a Brazilian man after the attempt on Fernández de Kirchner’s life but have not given a possible motive for the attack.\n\nArgentina 1985 portrays the struggle of chief prosecutor Julio Strassera, played by Ricardo Darín, and his young legal team racing to gather evidence before the trial starts of nine members of the old military junta. It also stars Santiago Armas, Alejandra Flechner, Peter Lanzani, Laura Paredes and Carlos Portaluppi.\n\nMitre uses some of the original testimony presented to court, including a woman forced to give birth in the back of a police car surrounded by laughing thugs, and mothers whose children were abducted and never returned home.\n\n“I experienced the dictatorship when I was an adolescent at school,” said Flechner, who plays Strassera’s wife. “The preparation [for the role] was somehow tattooed on my body. It was something I had already experienced.”\n\nAs many as 30,000 people disappeared under Argentina’s military dictatorship, according to human rights groups, although determining precise figures remains a topic of debate.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

    "Why 70% Inflation Is Just One of Argentina’s Problems": "Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nArgentina is facing some of the world’s highest inflation, with rates that have topped 70%. The government is on its third economy minister since July and President Alberto Fernandez’s leftist coalition looks permanently split. South America’s second-largest economy has almost no access to international capital, and it owes over $40 billion to the International Monetary Fund. Any bright spots? So far, a population hardened by decades of economic crisis has not turned to the kind of violent street protests that brought down the insolvent government of Sri Lanka. But the most likely paths forward all involve significant levels of pain.\n\n1. How serious is Argentina’s crisis?\n\nArgentina nosedived into an economic crisis in 2018 and it’s still far from fully recovered. Annual inflation has been above 50% about half the time since then, exacerbating three years of recession. Nearly 40% of Argentines live in poverty today, compared to about a quarter at the start of the crisis. Argentina has spent more time than almost any other nation in recession since the 1950s, according to the World Bank. Still, today’s price gains remain far from country’s last bout of hyperinflation in 1989 and 1990.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. How did things get so bad?\n\nA currency crisis led to the peso losing half of its value against the dollar in 2018. The IMF responded by loaning a record $57 billion to the government led by then-President Mauricio Macri, but the deal failed to stabilize the economy. Fernandez’s election in 2019 sparked a massive selloff in government bonds that his government later defaulted on. Without access to credit following the default, Fernandez printed money during the pandemic to finance cash handouts and salary programs, which set the stage for inflation to surge higher.\n\n3. Where do things stand?\n\nIn March, the IMF and Fernandez negotiated a new deal with the IMF. The primary purpose from the government’s perspective is that it pushes out payments owed from the first program -- so long as Argentina complies with the deal. Although the original repayment schedule remains in place, the new deal disburses IMF money to Argentina in a timetable that refinances the original payments by at least four years. But the IMF doesn’t just give all the money at once. Argentina has to pass quarterly reviews where the government must show progress on key yardsticks, such as accumulating foreign reserves and cutting its fiscal deficit. If it doesn’t pass the so-called review, Argentina risks defaulting on the IMF loan, which would remove almost all remaining sources of international financing for the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Is Argentina at risk of running out of money?\n\nThe central bank is running low on net cash reserves, down to an estimated $2.1 billion as of last week, according to consulting firm Equilibra. Total reserves are at less than half the level they were in 2019. That’s raising the risk of a potential currency devaluation, which in the past has provoked social tension. The very expectation of a devaluation is causing more people to buy dollars, hold exports or speed up imports, exacerbating the government’s greenback drain. A gap between the official exchange rate and a smorgasbord of parallel rates has held above 100% for over a month, a level and stretch of time not seen since Argentina’s hyperinflation days. The gap creates perverse incentives, like buying stuff on a credit in dollars only to pay it down in pesos at a discount, that only put more pressure on the exchange rate.\n\n5. What’s the government’s plan?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo far, there hasn’t really been one, besides trying to meet the goals set in the IMF deal. Fernandez said in a 2020 Financial Times interview: “Frankly, I don’t believe in economic plans.” The most consistent theme of his policies have been a reliance on piecemeal steps to limit economic pain, such as temporary price freezes and a ban on firing workers. That’s one reason markets are hoping new Economy Minister Sergio Massa will at least implement some of the tough policies built into the IMF deal. A key test will be whether Massa can address energy subsidies that have largely protected Argentines from the soaring utility prices seen around the world.\n\n6. How does politics figure into this?\n\nAnalysts across the spectrum agree Argentina’s main issue is political, not economic. The infighting between President Fernandez and his powerful Vice President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner (who is unrelated), has created a leadership vacuum. Fernandez and Kirchner, who was president herself from 2007 to 2015, disagree over economic strategy. Kirchner’s loyalists favor measures like introducing a universal basic income and have impeded Fernandez’s policy makers from implementing unpopular measures, such as utility price hikes. Beyond that split, Fernandez is up for re-election next year, when he’s expected to have a limited appetite for unpopular moves. The increase in poverty and economic impact of inflation also make austerity measures with short-term political costs and long-term economic gains harder to push forward.\n\n• Story on Argentines withdrawing $1 billion from banks.\n\n• IMF’s first review of Argentina’s program in June.\n\n• Article on Argentina central bank’s king-sized August rate hike meant to cool inflation.\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com\n\n©2022 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",
    "Thousands rally in defence of Argentina’s Fernandez de Kirchner": "Thousands take to the streets in Vice President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner’s defence as prosecutors seek a 12-year prison sentence in a corruption case.\n\nPolice in Argentina have clashed with supporters of Vice President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner in the country’s capital, Buenos Aires.\n\nThe clashes on Saturday took place as thousands took to the streets in her defence two days after prosecutors sought a 12-year prison sentence against her as well as a ban on public office for alleged corruption during her government.\n\nProsecutors say Fernandez de Kirchner led an illicit scheme that siphoned off state funds through the awarding of public works contracts to a family friend between 2007 and 2015 while she was president of the country.\n\nFernandez de Kirchner denies the charges and claims she is a victim of judicial and political persecution.\n\nThe largest demonstration on Saturday took place outside the vice president’s home in the elegant Buenos Aires neighbourhood of Recoleta, where in the early morning hours police set up fences in an effort to prevent a large gathering.\n\nThe demonstrators felt the fences were erected by Buenos Aires’ opposition mayor as a provocation and tore them down in the afternoon, which led to clashes with the police.\n\nHydrant trucks were brought in to disperse the crowds with water.\n\nAccording to local media, seven police officers were injured and two protesters were arrested. Fernandez de Kircher later asked her supporters to halt the protests.\n\n“In a democracy, the right to freedom of expression is fundamental,” she told her supporters from a makeshift stage in front of her house.\n\n“I want to say thank you and to ask you to go get some rest. It’s been a long day.”\n\nEarlier in the day, she had described the demonstrations as peaceful and joyful.\n\n“Today I woke up with the corner of my house literally besieged,” she wrote in a tweet. “They want to ban demonstrations of love and support that are absolutely peaceful and joyful, which are taking place in the face of the judiciary’s already undeniable persecution.”\n\nIn a sign of support, President Alberto Fernandez shared the message on his own Twitter account.\n\nHe has previously denounced the case against his deputy as judicial persecution, too.\n\n“Beyond the lack of evidence that the prosecutor demonstrated, the problem is that he started from a premise that said that she, as president, could not not know what was happening,” the president had said. “All the crimes she is accused of are crimes that require intent, having wanted to do it.”\n\nFernandez de Kirchner leads the most hardline wing of the centre-left Peronist coalition that has governed Argentina since the end of 2019.\n\nThe verdict and potential sentence will be decided by a judge, which could take months, though Fernandez de Kirchner could appeal any decision, possibly delaying the final verdict for years.",

    "Activists raise red flag over Argentina’s green hydrogen project": "The remote steppes of Argentina’s Rio Negro province are home to a rich, biodiverse ecosystem that for millennia has been disturbed only by the strong Patagonian winds. Now, these windswept plains could become the site of a massive new green hydrogen project.\n\nThe company aiming to build the project, Fortescue Future Industries, says it would create more than 15,000 direct jobs and put the province at the forefront of Argentina’s energy transition. But local activists say it could violate Indigenous land rights, harm the natural environment and endanger threatened condors.\n\nThe situation is fuelling debate over how to achieve a just transition towards sustainable energy.\n\n“I understand the need for green hydrogen that the First World might have … There’s an expectation of replacing the gas that Russia and others provided with another kind of energy, now and in the future,” Maria Fabiana Vega, an Indigenous community activist in Rio Negro’s capital, Viedma, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“But I think we all have to think in a different way, stop the consumption we’re immersed in, so we don’t harm other cultures and territories.”\n\nLast November, Australia’s Fortescue announced plans to invest $8.4bn in a green hydrogen project near the town of Sierra Grande, in the south of Rio Negro province. It would involve constructing a huge wind park, power transmission lines, a hydrogen production plant and port infrastructure.\n\n“Green hydrogen is one of the fuels of the future and it fills us with pride that Argentina is one of the countries that’s at the vanguard of the ecological transition,” Argentina’s President Alberto Fernandez said when the project was announced.\n\nUnprecedented scale\n\nBut most of the hydrogen produced would probably be exported due to a lack of demand domestically, acknowledged Sebastian Delgui, Fortescue’s regional manager of government and communities for Latin America.\n\n“Today, the main markets that are making the [energy] transition are Europe, Japan, Korea and the US,” he told Al Jazeera, noting the company foresees the future “development of demand” within Argentina.\n\nGreen hydrogen is produced by using renewable electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen can power vehicles, heat homes and replace natural gas in fertiliser production. It is considered an emissions-free energy source because hydrogen produces water, rather than the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, when burned.\n\nIn the Rio Negro project, for which the provincial government has allocated around 625,000 hectares (1.5 million acres) of land, electricity would be generated by an enormous wind farm.\n\n“It’s a scale that doesn’t exist in Argentina,” Leonardo Salgado, an environmental activist and palaeontology professor at the National University of Rio Negro, told Al Jazeera. “It means using an important part of the area of the province to provide for countries in the Global North.”\n\nThe government says the land it has granted to Fortescue is owned by the state. But the area is home to dozens of Indigenous communities, and campaigners say the project cannot go ahead unless they are consulted and give consent, in line with the International Labour Organization’s Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, which Argentina has ratified.\n\nThe country is also conducting a nationwide survey of Indigenous communities to protect their rights to their ancestral lands, and communities cannot be evicted from disputed areas until the survey is complete.\n\nBut the process has been repeatedly delayed, and data from Argentina’s National Institute of Indigenous Affairs shows that several communities in the region have not yet been surveyed.\n\n“So long as the survey of [Indigenous] community land isn’t complete, they can’t touch that land,” Vega said.\n\nDelgui said Fortescue had conducted a social impact study with the local university, was working on an environmental assessment, and had asked the province to consult with community actors.\n\n“We want there to be prior consultation, because … we’re convinced that the local communities have to accompany us,” he said. “The project will not advance without a consultation.”\n\nCondors at risk\n\nIn January, Fortescue contracted the Argentine company IMPSA to supply wind measurement masts on the Somuncura plateau. The move triggered alarm bells among biologists, who say building a wind farm there would spell disaster for Andean condors, which are considered a threatened species in Argentina.\n\nEvidence from Europe suggests the condors would likely fly into the wind turbines, according to Rayen Estrada Pacheco, a biologist with the nonprofit Argentine Bioandean Foundation’s condor conservation programme.\n\nWhile the company says it will avoid areas where condors nest, Estrada Pacheco told Al Jazeera that the birds “really use all of the environment”.\n\nIn July, Fortescue told local media that it would pause the installation of wind measurement masts on the plateau as it waited for the provincial government to adapt its management plan for the area. “There isn’t a single mast on the Somuncura plateau,” Delgui said.\n\nOther aspects of the project have also raised concerns among environmentalists. The water used in the electrolysis process would be taken from the sea, to preserve Rio Negro’s precious fresh water supplies. But this would require the construction of a desalination plant, and to be transported, hydrogen is often converted into ammonia, which can be harmful to humans and the environment if not managed properly.\n\nDaniel Sanguinetti, Rio Negro’s state secretary for planning, told Al Jazeera that an environmental impact study was being conducted on the possible risks. The government has been working with community leaders to develop protocols for implementing the project, including time for public debate, he added.\n\nWith regards to the condors, “we have to preserve those 64 birds that have been released so far [in efforts to restore their population in this area], and we also have to support the planet, and also generate economic activity for 750,000 inhabitants of the province”, Sanguinetti said.\n\nStill, Estrada Pacheco fears the project could put at risk decades of work: “It’s been an enormous effort for a lot of people and a lot of institutions … for the condor to return. To think that a company could install itself there, for a project to produce green hydrogen that isn’t even going to stay in the country – that’s very frustrating.”",
    "Face masks no longer required in Argentina": "Face masks no longer required in Argentina\n\n22nd Thursday, September 2022 - 19:05 UTC Full article\n\nARS-CoV-2 is a seasonal circulation virus, Argentina's Health Ministry found\n\nArgentina's health authorities have decided that the wearing of face masks is no longer mandatory in any indoor setting, it was announced.\n\nWhile maintaining all other recommendations regarding sanitary precautions, the Health Ministry issued Resolution 1849/2022 lifting face covering restrictions in any indoor setting such as public transport or banking offices.\n\nThe decision was based on the decrease in the number of cases and mass vaccination, it was explained.\n\nRegardless of the broad measure, the federal government ruled that each jurisdiction will be able to adopt the pertinent recommendations according to its particular epidemiological situation and the planned sanitary strategy.\n\nThe mandatory use of masks was introduced in March 2020, just after the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhile other jurisdictions have taken steps towards loosening the restrictive requirements, it was not until Wednesday's publishing in the Official Gazette that the National Government made any changes in this regard.\n\nThe Ministry argued that the impact of COVID-19 in 2022, occurs in the context of a population with high vaccination coverage and added that currently, after a new period of increase of cases, smaller than the previous ones, a period of sustained decrease of cases is evidenced.\n\nAs a result of the progress in vaccination coverage, the incidence of serious disease and mortality due to COVID-19 has been considerably reduced, regardless of the circulating variant, the Ministry went on.\n\nThe National Vaccination Campaign had reached until Sept. 6, 2022, ”a coverage of 82.5% of the general population and 81.7% of those over 3 years of age with two (2) doses of vaccine, and 46.7% in the general population and 73.5% in those over 60 years of age with the first booster, the Ministry also said in its Resolution.\n\nRegarding intensive care beds used by COVID-19 patients, nationwide figures were below 75% occupancy, and the number of patients has been decreasing over the past 4 weeks.\n\nIn this new stage of the pandemic it can be affirmed that SARS-CoV-2 is a seasonal circulation virus and, furthermore, that natural immunity and/or vaccine immunity does not guarantee its elimination, therefore particular situations may arise where it is necessary to establish the use of masks”, the Ministry also argued.\n\nA MercoPress correspondent in Buenos Aires saw local healthcare facilities were still requiring patients and visitors Thursday morning to wear a facemask, while staff at many local restaurants and bars continued to wear them despite the federal government's decision. Several cab drivers admitted they needed to wear them because prospective passengers changed their minds and told them to drive on if they are bare-faced.",
    "Ymer brothers shock Argentina in Bologna": "In the first match, Sweden’s No.2 Elias Ymer scooped an unexpected lead, beating Sebastián Báez in 2 hours and 26 minutes. Things did not improve for Argentina in the second match and the younger of the Ymer brothers, world No.98 Mikael, defeated No.17-ranked Diego Schartzman in just 96 minutes.\n\n\"I'm very happy because we weren't favorites in this group with teams like Argentina, Croatia and Italy\", said Elias after the match. \"This victory is worth double\".\n\nElias Ymer opened Sweden's campaign and his strong serve and clinical forehand gave him a first break of serve in the third game of his match; Baez’s erratic serving also helped. The Swede held on to his advantage to wrap up the first set.",
