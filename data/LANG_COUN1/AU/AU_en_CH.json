    "Gold sourcing and Switzerland in focus at the Human Rights Council": "Melting point: four of the world's biggest gold refineries call Switzerland home. Keystone / Pat Roque\n\nAs the latest session of the Human Rights Council got underway at the United Nations European headquarters in Geneva, illegally-mined gold came up in multiple discussions, with the role of importers, including Switzerland, being cited in UN findings.\n\nThis content was published on September 26, 2022 - 09:00\n\nPaula Dupraz-Dobias Paula Dupraz-Dobias is an award-winning Geneva-based journalist covering environment, business, international organizations, humanitarian crises and Latin America.\n\nLast week, a special rapporteur investigating the use of mercury in small-scale gold mining and a UN fact-finding mission on Venezuela presented separate reports to the council on the impact of gold mining on many communities and the environment, particularly in the Amazon basin.\n\nUN investigators cited human rights abuses such as sexual exploitation of women and children, mercury poisoning and child labour affecting communities where illegal gold production occurs, and pointed the finger at the responsibility of countries buying the metal.\n\nThe reports said global buyers such as Switzerland – through which roughly two-thirds of global trade transits – need to ensure that human rights are respected throughout supply chains.\n\nInsatiable demand and a lack of due diligence\n\n“This is a serious issue,” Marcos Orellana, the UN’s special rapporteur on toxic substances, who investigated human rights abuses in small-scale mining, told SWI swissinfo.ch. “In the coming months and years, we can expect further scrutiny by human rights mechanisms of the gold sector and of countries where refiners are located, including Switzerland.”\n\nSwitzerland is the top global importer of gold, having purchased CHF90 billion ($92.3 billion) of the metal in 2021. Four of the biggest refineries globally are located in Switzerland, two of which are foreign-owned.\n\nIn 2020, the Reuters news agency estimated that three of the top refiners – Valcambi, Argor-Heraeus and PAMP – refined roughly 1,500 tonnes of gold annually.\n\nOrellana described to the Human Rights Council last Tuesday how pregnant women in Indigenous communities living downstream from gold mining in the Bolivian jungle had high mercury blood levels due to consumption of contaminated fish, while sexual abuse and violence was prevalent in mining areas. The reportExternal link describes how even on Pacific islands, thousands of kilometres from gold mines, elevated levels of mercury were found in residents, due to global contamination in oceans.\n\nAccording to the UN, some 10 to 15 million people were directly employed in small-scale gold mining globally in 2017, including roughly a million children and 4.5 million women.\n\nMercury, which is used to separate the gold from other substances, is a highly toxic heavy metal, that bio-accumulates in living beings and can cause permanent damage in humans including neurological disorders, reproductive disorders and death.\n\n“The use of mercury is propelled by the insatiable demand for gold by financial markets and jewelers in the wealthiest countries,” Orellana told the Human Rights Council assembly. “Refineries in industrial countries which buy the gold lack adequate mechanisms for due diligence to address the human rights abuses associated with mercury and small-scale gold mining.” The report singled out by name Switzerland and the United Kingdom, which in 2020 topped the Alpine nation in terms of gold imports.\n\nSpeaking to SWI by phone after his exposé, he said that Switzerland needed to do more.\n\n“Switzerland… does not have an adequate traceability system that would require refineries to know where the gold came from and how it was mined,” Orellana said. “The traceability system that Switzerland has ends with the intermediary country. This gap is exploited by criminal syndicates and drug cartels that traffic in mercury and gold.”\n\n“While the gold industry profits, human rights suffer,” he added.\n\nIn Peru’s southeastern Madre de Dios region, SWI previously reportedExternal link how nearly 1,000 square kilometres of rainforest had been lost, as illegal miners sold their gold to buyers, including allegedly in Switzerland, willing to turn a blind eye.\n\nFollowing Orellana’s presentation to the council, more than 40 countries participated in an interactive dialogue on measures needed to reduce human rights abuses in small-scale mining. The Swiss mission was not one of them.\n\nPaola Ceresetti, a spokesperson for the mission, later responded to SWI’s request to comment following the publication of the report. “In Switzerland, the gold trade is controlled by one of the strictest legislations in the world. The law on the regulation of precious metals and money laundering in particular aim to ensure that gold handled by refiners does not originate from fraudulent sources,” she wrote in an email.\n\nVenezuela’s gold abyss\n\nAccording to another related report to the Human Rights Council, armed violence between sindicatos – criminal groups controlling mines – as well as labour and sexual exploitation, and horrific punishments through arbitrary justice, are rife in Venezuela’s gold mining region. The area known as the Arco Minero was created specifically to mine resources as the country’s economy slid, with the hope that it would attract foreign investment. Residents as well as miners were often “caught in a crossfire of violence in the struggle to control gold,” Francisco Cox, a member of the fact-finding mission told journalists.\n\nThe report will be presented in session today to the Human Rights Council.\n\nCox said non-state actors, such as the sindicatos, as well as authorities, including military and civilian leaders, which hold financial interests in mining operations, were responsible for killings, extorsion, corporal punishment and gender-based violence.\n\nWhile official data is sparse and lacking in transparency, various reports estimate that between 70-90% of gold sourced from the mining region is illegally produced, Cox said.\n\nThe Venezuela report recommended that countries importing gold adopt measures to prevent gold laundering as well as money laundering from the gold sourced in Venezuela’s mining regions.\n\nOfficial Swiss data shows that the country stopped importing gold directly from Venezuela in 2016. But since then, there has been concern that gold could wind up in Switzerland after transiting through other countries.\n\nVenezuela’s mission to the UN in Geneva did not respond to a request by SWI to comment on allegations of collusion and involvement of authorities in the gold trade.\n\nTransparency on trial\n\nAs pressure mounts on importers of gold to ensure cleaner sourcing, Swiss refiners recently responded by pledging to remove all gold originating in Indigenous lands from their supply chains. In 2020, Japanese-owned Neuchâtel-based Metalor said it was halting purchases from artisanal mines.\n\nSwiss data nonetheless show that large volumes of gold are imported from non-producing countries, including in the Middle East and Europe, begging the question of where the gold originates.\n\nMany are pushing for answers.\n\nThe Society for Threatened Peoples, a Bern-based NGO, is awaiting a decision in the coming months from the Supreme Court, following its request submitted in 2018 to the federal customs authority to publish files relating to the exact origin of gold imported into the country, arguing that was is in the public interest to know. STP has long investigated illegal gold production in the Amazon and its links to Swiss refiners.\n\nEdited by Virginie Mangin\n\nIn compliance with the JTI standards\n\nMore: SWI swissinfo.ch certified by the Journalism Trust Initiative",
    "Best things to do in Switzerland": "No country has it all, but the Swiss are justified in feeling pretty smug about their lot. Here you’ll find that almost every drive, train journey, boat trip or cable car ride has an element of the epic, taking you to thundering falls, gorges, valleys hidden deep in the mountains and World Heritage vineyards.\n\nCities with medieval old towns, big-hitter galleries and extraordinary cultural cachet are often just a whisper away from vivid turquoise lakes and the glacier-capped Alps. The stride between urban and outdoors is effortless.\n\nWhether you’re floating down the Rhine in Basel, admiring Paul Klee’s punchy art in Bern, hiking below the mighty Matterhorn, feeling the thrill of ice at the Aletsch Glacier, or sipping Chasselas wines in the terraced vineyards of the Lavaux as the last sun touches Lake Geneva like a caress, here’s our rundown of the best 12 things to do in Switzerland.\n\nIt's popular in Basel to go for a leisurely summertime swim in the Rhine © encrier / Getty Images / iStockphoto\n\nFloat down the Rhine in Basel\n\nAt the point where Switzerland, Germany and France converge in the north, Basel dives into creative waters when it comes to avant-garde art and architecture, with a raft of galleries right up there with Europe’s best. But this city also likes to let its mind drift.\n\nCue the Rhine, where office workers ditch suits and families gather for a city swim on weekends. A novel way to see Basel is to grab a Wickelfisch (a fish-shaped waterproof bag to keep your stuff dry) and then make for the river banks in Kleinbasel, strip to your bathers and float past city landmarks as the current of the river carries you gently downstream. If you prefer to keep your head above water, rent a stand-up paddleboard or join a tour with Birs73. Basler like to end their dip socially, with drinks and a sunbathe at a buvette (riverside bar), especially on hot summer days.\n\nPlanning tip: Hop into the river just below Museum Tinguely to float 3km down the Rhine, or plot your own route by taking a look at the map. You can buy a Wickelfisch at the tourist office on central Barfüsserplatz.\n\nImmerse yourself in the best experiences the world has to offer with our email newsletter delivered weekly into your inbox.\n\nSleep under a Million Stars\n\nIt’s a night silent enough to hear your own heartbeat. Up in the Alps, darkness falls, and the only sound is the gentle chime of cowbells. Constellations and distant planets sprinkle the night sky like handfuls of glitter. Sound beautiful? It is. Harnessing the wild, Million Stars is a huge collection of open-air, one-of-a-kind sleeps across the country, where you can slip back to nature and enjoy a little pre-bedtime stargazing.\n\nBut we’re not just talking canvas here. These imaginative sleeps are ones that you’ll be raving about for years to come – from beautifully made-up beds plonked on top of remote mountains to a stylishly converted gondola on the edge of a crag, a bed under an apple tree and a ‘beehive’ pod with views of Eiger’s mile-high North Face. And with this being Switzerland, they are not just clever but comfortable.\n\nPlanning tip: As each place only sleeps two, advance booking is highly advisable. Most open from July to October.\n\nRide the Glacier Express\n\nNo country nails rail travel like the Swiss, where little red trains (polished and perfectly on time) chug from valley to peak with ease, leaving you to swoon over the Alpine scenery from the comfort of your panoramic carriage. Evoking a golden age of travel, Switzerland’s train journeys are hands-down some of the world’s finest.\n\nThe big one everyone is eager to do once (and with good reason) is the Glacier Express, which crosses over the Furka, Oberalp and Bernina passes on the eight-hour ride between Zermatt and St Moritz in Graubünden’s Upper Engadin. Riveting views of meadows, forests, fast-flowing turquoise rivers, canyons, castles, big-shouldered mountains and glaciers keep you glued to the window. The entire journey is a remarkable feat of 1930s engineering, but special mention goes to the Landwasser viaduct – the gravity-defying six-arched bridge that leaps between Tiefencastel and Filisur, and the Oberalp Pass (2033m), harnessing the true wilderness of the Swiss Alps.\n\nPlanning tip: If you want to save a few francs, regularly scheduled services plying the same route can be just as enjoyable and significantly less expensive. Break up the journey by using cheaper SBB trains and overnighting along the way\n\nHike in the Swiss National Park\n\nFor a taste of the Alps before the tourists rock up, head southeast to the Swiss National Park in Graubünden’s Lower Engadin valley, where the mountains nudge their way over into Italy. Easily accessed from the quaint villages of Scuol, Zernez and S-chanf, Switzerland’s only national park is a 172-sq-km visual feast of rushing streams, high moors, pastures, glaciers, larch, pine woods and lakes. Here, nature has been left totally to its own devices: no trees are felled, no meadows are cut, and no animals have been hunted since the park was founded in 1914.\n\nThe only way to properly see the park is by chucking on boots and heading for its trail-laced heart. If you only have time for one walk, make it Lakes of Macun, a 21km (13-mile) day hike from Zernez, leading to a high Alpine plateau splashed with 23 lakes that shimmer topaz and sapphire. If you prefer, you can join a guided walk with one of the park rangers (you can book these at the visitor center in Zernez). With an expert in tow, you stand better chances of spotting rarities like wild edelweiss, ibex, chamois, golden eagles and bearded vultures.\n\nPlanning tip: Camping is off limits, but you can stay the night at the gloriously remote Chamanna Cluozza. At 1882m above sea level, this is quite possibly the off-grid log cabin of your wildest Alpine dreams. The hut is reached on a moderately challenging 3½-hour uphill hike from Zernez. Bring your own sleeping bag.\n\nA boat ride on Lake Lucerne is brimming with historical sights © Keitma / Shutterstock\n\nBoat across Lake Lucerne\n\nThere are higher mountains in Switzerland than those rimming the fjord-like shores of Lake Lucerne, but none are more enshrined in flag-waving Swiss myth. Boat across the emerald waters of Lake Uri, and you’ll glimpse Rütli Meadow, the hallowed birthplace of the Swiss Confederation in 1291. You can also experience the Tellskapelle, a tiny frescoed chapel where, lore has it, apple-shooting hero and beloved Swiss rebel William Tell escaped from the boat of his Hapsburg captor, Gessler.\n\nLegends swirl like storm clouds over the mountains on the doorstep of Lucerne. Since 1889, the world’s steepest cogwheel railway has been rattling up to 2128m (6981ft) Mt Pilatus, where the restless ghost of Roman prefect Pontius Pilate is said to still roam. Never mind the spook stories; you’ll be captivated by the views reaching as far as Germany’s Black Forest on cloudless days. Its beauty rival is 1797m (5895ft) Mt Rigi, famous for its painterly sunrises and sunsets and once a source of fascination to JMW Turner, who painted it in three different moods.\n\nPlanning tip: Lucerne makes an appealing base for exploring the lake, with its Old Town, medieval wooden bridge and promenade strung along the lakeshore.\n\nTake the Eiger Express to Jungfraujoch\n\nYou’ve got to hand it to the Swiss – they are always ahead of the game. Since 1912, a little red train, fueled by hydro-power from the outset, has curled up to Jungfraujoch, Europe’s highest train station at 3454m (11,332ft), blasting through the icy heart of Eiger. Just recently, the journey has become even more eco-friendly with Grindelwald’s Eiger Express, a fancy, super-speedy new tri-cable gondola that covers the first leg of the journey using its wheels to generate green power. The ride will make you gasp out loud as you float above the landscape, with spruce forests and log chalets giving way to a realm of rock and ice. You’ll get so close to Eiger’s beastly, mile-high North Face that you’ll feel as though you’ll slam right into it.\n\nAt the top of World Heritage Jungfraujoch, temperatures drop, and the world is always white. You’ll be wowed by the view from the Sphinx observation deck, reaching across a sea of snow-capped, 4000m peaks and the 23km swirl of the Aletsch Glacier while Germany and France hover in the distance. The frosty Ice Palace is a wonderland of ice tunnels and sculptures – they are impressive today but must have been even more so back when mountaineers first hacked them out by pickaxe in the 1930s.\n\nDetour: Bring warm layers and boots, particularly if you fancy the 45-minute stomp to Mönchsjochhütte, Switzerland’s highest-serviced mountain hut.\n\nDrive the Furka Pass\n\nYou won’t be able to tell if it’s the stomach-flipping hairpin bends or the gobsmacking views that make your heart beat so wildly on this high, twisty, up-and-over-the-Alps drive from the isolated valley of the Goms in Valais to mountain-encrusted Andermatt in Uri – the gateway to southeast Switzerland.\n\nDrive the 31km (19-mile) Furka Pass from west to east to maximize the drama as dark, craggy peaks and glaciers fill your rear-view mirror. If you have a bit of a Bond moment behind the wheel, it’s no coincidence; this road starred in the car chase scene in the 1964 movie Goldfinger. As you swing dizzily around switchbacks, the road tops out at the 2429m (7969ft) Furka Pass, where you can peer across the lunar rockscape of a wind-battered plateau to the deeply-crevassed Rhône Glacier and its ice grotto before the long, sweeping descent to Andermatt.\n\nPlanning tip: The road is open roughly from June to October (depending on snow conditions) but check conditions before heading out.\n\nGo offbeat in Ticino’s valleys\n\nIn the sultry, parle Italiano canton of Ticino in southern Switzerland, it’s the lakes that get all the love. But dip into Ticino’s hidden valleys, and you’ll lose the crowds and find the region’s true pulse. Here glassy, jewel-colored rivers float past chestnut woods and insanely pretty granite hamlets cresting hilltops (including Switzerland’s smallest, Corippo, with a population of just 15).\n\nAnd after a day’s hike or bike ride, you can kick back on the vine-swathed terrace of a rustic grotti (tavern) for polenta and brasato (beef braised in red wine) with a glass of the beefy local Merlot red wine.\n\nThe wild, woody Valle Maggia is a magnet to mountain bikers and hikers, laced with 700km (435 miles) of trails, including the challenging 52km (32-mile), six-day Via Alta, spotlighting the region’s best. For more adventure, head over to the rugged Val Verzasca, bisected by its namesake emerald river and crisscrossed by the Sentiero Verzasca trail. Every Alpine activity imaginable is offered in this valley, from hiking and cycling to rafting, bouldering, paragliding and bungee jumping from the 220m Verzasca Dam, which starred in the opening scene of Golden Eye. Swissraft makes it happen.\n\nHit up Switzerland's capital city of Bern for superb museums, medieval landmarks and lovely river and Alps views © Marcus Lindstrom / iStockphoto / Getty Images\n\nGet a culture fix in Bern\n\nYou might have an I-can’t-believe-it’s-the-capital moment roaming the streets of Bern, with its refreshingly easygoing vibe, parks and alfresco cafes, resident bears and lush backdrop of hills. The city is certainly a looker, situated on a sharp bend in the startlingly turquoise Aare River, rimmed by gentle hills and with views of the snow-frosted Alps on crisp, clear days. And you can get your cultural kicks here too.\n\nBegin with a romp around the Altstadt, Bern’s medieval, cobbled, arcaded, flag-bedecked Unesco World Heritage heart. Here you’ll spy the ornate Zytglogge clock (come at four minutes before the hour for the glockenspiel parade), the 15th-century Gothic Münster (hike up its lofty spire, Switzerland’s tallest, far-reaching views over the rooftops) and many folkloric fountains, including the Kindlifresserbrunnen, depicting a giant snacking on children.\n\nMuseum-wise, Bern is a treat. Tour the apartment where Einstein lived and the magnificent Kunstmuseum, showing fine arts from Renaissance masterpieces to Monets and Picassos. Make the short hop out to Renzo Piano’s architecturally bold, wave-like Zentrum Paul Klee, presenting the color-charged works of Swiss-born German artist Paul Klee.\n\nDetour: Break up sightseeing with a wild swim in the Aare River. When the weather warms, join the Berner for a cooling downstream float.\n\nAdmire the Aletsch Glacier\n\nAs you journey into the remote Goms valley in Valais, the Alps take a turn for the wilder, and the hamlets are pure Heidi stuff, with sun-blackened chalets and flower-freckled meadows sweeping up to whopping mountains. The Matterhorn gets all the fuss, but just as arresting is the Aletsch Glacier, the jewel in the crown of the Unesco World Heritage Jungfrau-Aletsch region. Powering past wispy waterfalls, rock spires and the dagger-shaped summit of Aletschhorn (4193m) like a six-lane glacial superhighway, this 23km swirl of deeply crevassed ice is the longest and most voluminous glacier in the Alps.\n\nObserve the glacier from the viewpoint, or – for close-ups – hit the trail on the 17km (10.5-mile), five- to six-hour hike from Fiescheralp to Bettmeralp, where every bend in the ice reveals phenomenal views and the odd Valais Blacknose sheep. If you prefer instant thrills, wobble across the Aletschji–Grünsee Suspension Bridge, which straddles the 80m-deep Massa Gorge.\n\nPlanning tip: Reaching the glacier is part of the fun. From Fiesch, take the cable car up to Fiescheralp, then beyond to Eggishorn for your first glimpse of the mighty Aletsch.\n\nSki or hike below the Matterhorn\n\nNothing is more thoroughly Swiss than the Matterhorn, the peak that sums up Switzerland’s outdoor-loving spirit, which has broken many a rock climber’s rope (and soul) and has a chocolate bar (Toblerone) shaped in its honor. Arrive in Zermatt on the train that chugs from Täsch. Like those who have come before you, you won’t be able to stop yourself from obsessively gawping at that mountain.\n\nAnd who could blame you? Razoring up above the Italian border in southern Valais, this 4478m fang of rock and ice is utterly mesmerizing, especially when seen from above. You can ski, hike or climb in its pyramid-shaped shadow by riding the world's highest-altitude 3S cable car to 3883m (12,739ft): Matterhorn Glacier Paradise, Europe’s highest cable-car station on the Klein Matterhorn (3883m), with views reaching deep into the Swiss, French and Italian Alps.\n\nFor close-ups of the melting ice, hook onto the two-hour, 6.5km (4-mile), moderately challenging Matterhorn Glacier Trail. When the flakes fall in winter, you can pound the powder on 360km of ski runs, some of which dip over the border into Italy and nearly all with distractingly lovely views of the Matterhorn.\n\nPlanning tip: If you have some climbing experience under your belt, you can climb your way to the top with an Alpine guide.\n\nThe vineyards of Lavaux have been around for centuries © Puripatl / Getty Images / iStockphoto\n\nWalk among vines in Lavaux\n\nIn the country’s western crook, the World Heritage-listed Lavaux vineyards are heaven on earth to oenophiles. The world’s steepest vineyards stagger up the terraced hills above Lake Geneva. If you’ve never heard of them, it’s because the hand-picked wines are so select and small-batch that the Swiss keep most of them to themselves, and few bottles ever reach export.\n\nBefore hitting the caveaux (wine cellars) for a petite dégustation (tasting), brush up your wine knowledge. It’s said that these grapes are blessed by three suns: the one in the sky, the one on the lake and the one radiating heat from the dry-stone walls. The main grape is Chasselas, a very old variety producing crisp, flinty white wines with a fresh, citrusy nose. The fruity reds (Gamay, Pinot noir and Salvagnin) make up just 20% of production.\n\nYou can drive the meandering roads that loop around 40km of shore or take the Lavaux Panoramic Train, but you’ll get a better feel for the Lavaux by heading out on foot. Little trails dip into the vines everywhere, but top billing goes to the 11km (6.8-mile) trail from St-Saphorin to Lutry, where you’ll take in stirring views, pretty villages and welcoming cellars.\n\nPlanning tip: For a great primer on Lavaux wines, stop off at Vinorama in Rivaz. Housed in a strikingly revamped bunker, the lakefront center speeds you through the wine-growing process, and you can sample dozens of different wines in the Espace Dégustation.",
    "Geothermal project of at Lavey-les-Bains, Switzerland unsuccessful": "Geothermal project of at Lavey-les-Bains, Switzerland unsuccessful\n\nWinter view of Les Bains de Lavey, Switzerland (source: Les Bains de Lavey)\n\nCarlo Cariaga 26 Sep 2022\n\nFlowrate of the drilled well at Lavey-les-Bains, Switzerland will not enough to support the planned geothermal power plant. The rig will now move to the next planned site at Vinzel.\n\nIn a blow to geothermal development ambitions in the Canton of Vaud, the developer of the geothermal project in Lavey-les-Bains, Switzerland reports flow rates of the well drilled are insufficient for a successful implementation of a planned geothermal power plant. The project has been temporarily suspended as the rig moves to the next drilling site in Vinzel, another prospective site identified by a previous seismic survey campaign.\n\nWe had previously reported on the progress of the drilling for the Lavey-les-Bains project by the Alpine Geothermal Power Production (AGEPP). Drilling through the hard gneiss was a challenge that the team was able to overcome, and some planned logging measurements had to be cancelled. The temperatures that were measured at the bottom of the well exceeded expectations, but there was not enough flow to sustain geothermal power production.\n\n“We would clearly have liked better efficiency, but that is part of the random nature of geothermal energy. At least this experience taught us quite a few things about our basement. Moreover, we have other geothermal projects to come, notably in Vinzel and Montagny-près-Yverdon.” said Vaud State Councilor Vassilis Venizelos.\n\n“Ultimately, the goal is to produce a fifth of the canton’s heating needs with geothermal energy. To achieve this, however, we must increase the means allocated to our knowledge of the soil. In the canton of Vaud, we know that we have interesting geothermal potential. It remains to develop it. In a general way, ” said Venizelos.\n\nData collected from the well will prove to be valuable in characterizing the subsurface of the region. The securing of the well has been completed and the site will soon be restored.\n\nFor Geothermie Suisse, the umbrella organization for the geothermal industry in Switzerland, the outcome of the Lavey-les-Bains project proves that the risk association with exploration of the subsurface must not be carried by the business or individual developers. As Switzerland has no oil, gas, or mining tradition, there is very little information on its subsurface. Thus, the risk of failure in geothermal is higher than other renewable energies. To obtain equal treatment, the geological risk must be fully borne by the Conferederation.\n\nBenoît Valley, full professor at the Institute of Hydrogeology and Geothermal Energy at the University of Neuchâtel, advises that the geothermal industry must persevere despite the failure at Lavey-les-Bains. “Ideally, we should persevere, since we know that in Lavey, there is water. It is used for baths. To give an order of magnitude, it is necessary to make between 5 and 7 boreholes, to have 1 or 2 of them functional. That said, the better we know the Swiss subsoil, the more effective the drilling will become.”\n\nSource: 20 Minutes",
    "Becoming a Black woman in Switzerland": "For Rachel M’Bon, being Swiss has meant almost daily finding a way to prove belonging.\n\nWhen she was a teenager, M’Bon once had three police officers overpower her and arrest her when she entered the building that she was working in all because they were convinced she had broken in, all because she is Black.\n\n“I was born in Switzerland,” the filmmaker said. “Many times I have found myself at the police station because I did not have my papers with me, while my friends just went home. Because they were not Black.”\n\nDespite being born and raised in Switzerland, as a woman of African descent, M’Bon said she has never really been able to fit in. And because of the country’s legacy of neutrality, many Swiss people, and indeed others around the globe, deny the possibility of Swiss racism or discrimination, she added.\n\n“The image of perfection of Switzerland must be deconstructed because it excludes the possibility of speaking about the people who are discriminated against and also denies the possibility of fighting against this history,” M’Bon said. “It is very hard to fight against racism when there is a generalised denial about the phenomenon.”\n\nM’Bon wanted to show this discrimination and how it affected not just her life but other Black women across the country. The filmmaker created Becoming a Black Woman, a documentary that shows the micro aggressions and larger discriminations that Black women living in Switzerland have faced.\n\n“I wanted to find a subtle way so [Black women’s] voices were heard and to reveal to Swiss citizens and those abroad what is going on here, because more often than not there, is the perception that the issues of racism only pertain to other countries,” she said.\n\n“Switzerland, miraculously, has avoided this issue to the extent that it does not have a colonial past,” M’Bon continued. “[This movie] has also the objective of showing that Switzerland is no stranger to racism, quite the opposite.”\n\nThe film shows stories of Black women who suffer and fight against racism and discrimination. It also shows how their struggle to find themselves and come to terms with their identity in a society that makes them very aware of their “otherness”.\n\n“[It’s women] who are always at the end of the chain, [depicting only women] was a way of redressing a general neglect of women’s voices”, explained M’Bon.\n\nUN Human Rights report on racial justice and equality, released on July 2021, establishes a four-point agenda to end systemic racism and human rights violations against Africans and people of African descent. It calls on States to stop denying racism and start dismantling it; end impunity and build trust; listen to people of African descent, their concerns and also the solutions they bring to the table; and confront past legacies, taking special measures, and delivering reparatory justice.\n\nM’Bon said the film has started to make a difference. Various screenings of Becoming a Black Woman have attracted diverse audiences, including white young men who after having watched the film later told M’Bon that now they perceived Black women differently and they wanted to learn how they could become allies and fight against their own biases.\n\n“Some of them have become aware of the absurdity of their behaviour. That’s what I wanted to depict through the film, that in the end, what is important is that we are all human beings,” M’Bon said.\n\nThe Learn, Speak Up, and Act! Campaign, launched by UN Human Rights on July 2022 is a global call for concrete action against racism, discrimination, xenophobia, and related intolerance. The challenges posed by these problems are not new, and neither are the solutions. What is needed is action – by governments, institutions, groups, and individuals, particularly young people.\n\n“We cannot have a George Floyd every week so that people react,” M’Bon said. “So it is important to have these campaigns. For me, it is key to reach young people and raise awareness amongst them, because they are the adults of tomorrow. It is also important that politicians take a clear stance. One must be able to infiltrate power and daily life with messages and information, and little by little develop strategies that will help people realise that everybody would win if we find solutions that allow a whole society to live in equality.”\n\nA special screening of Becoming a Black Woman by Rachel M’Bon and Juliana Fanjul, will take place on September 20 at 18:30 at Cinerama Empire, Rue de Carouge 71, in Geneva, as part of Ciné ONU.\n\nAfter the screening, there will be a discussion on “Dismantling systemic racism – Learn, Speak Up and Act!” with Rachel M’Bon, Mona Rishmawi, Chief of Rule of Law, Equality and Non-Discrimination Branch at UN Human Rights, and Yvonne Apiyo Brändle-Amolo, Swiss Parliamentarian, intercultural mediator, film producer, and feminist artist-activist.

    "Explainer: how Switzerland is dealing with rising prices": "Inflation disproportionately affects the lowest income households © Keystone / Gaetan Bally\n\nAlthough inflation remains relatively low in Switzerland (3.5%), rising prices for energy and certain basic consumer goods risk exerting a major impact on Swiss households. A look at how inflation is affecting Switzerland.\n\nThis content was published on September 22, 2022 - 09:00\n\nPauline Turuban My specialty is telling stories, and decoding what happens in Switzerland and the world from accumulated data and statistics. An expatriate in Switzerland for several years, I have also worked as a multimedia journalist for the Swiss national broadcaster.\n\nWhy is Switzerland less affected by inflation than other countries?\n\nSupply problems linked to the Covid-19 pandemic and the strong recovery in global demand following the health crisis have caused energy and commodity prices to soar globally. The war in Ukraine has made the situation worse. The upward trend is clearly a global phenomenon and therefore that also affects Switzerland.\n\nThe Alpine country nonetheless managed to contain inflation compared to other countries. The overall consumer price index rose by 3.5% over one year in Switzerland, versus 10% in the European Union and over 8% in the United States.\n\nExternal Content\n\nEnergy prices increased in Switzerland by 28% and food prices by 2%, against 38% and 10.6% in the eurozone.\n\nExternal Content\n\nThe current strength of the Swiss franc acts as a buffer.\n\n“The euro has lost almost 10 cents against the franc since the start of the year, which means that imported goods are a lot cheaper,” explains Mathieu GrobétyExternal link, director of the Institute of Applied Economics at the University of Lausanne. Around one-quarter of all products consumed in Switzerland are affected.\n\nExternal Content\n\nThe economics expert adds that energy prices in Switzerland are slightly less concerned by international fluctuations than for other countries, due to a regulated market where part of the pricing is fixed in advance and to a larger share of renewable energy produced by Alpine dams.\n\nMathieu Grobéty, director of the Institute of Applied Economics at the University of Lausanne. Fabrice Ducrest / UNIL\n\nThe location of non-EU member Switzerland, in the heart of Europe surrounded by eurozone countries, and concerns about large numbers of Swiss regularly crossing the border to neighbouring countries for cheaper offers, have also played a role, according to Grobéty. Swiss food distributors have not immediately passed on higher global costs to dissuade Swiss consumers from making their purchases abroad. But Mathieu Grobéty still expects inflation to “catch up [to other countries] by the end of the year and then to slow down from the start of 2023”.\n\nHow is inflation visible in Switzerland ?\n\nThe prices of many basic goods and supplies, such as energy, have risen over the past 12 months. For example, the price of heating oil, used by around 40% of Swiss households, has almost doubled, and gas has jumped by nearly 60%.\n\nElectricity prices are usually announced every year at the end of August. An average rise of 27% is expected for 2023, with large differences depending on where you live ‒ in Switzerland the electricity network is managed locally with around 600 suppliers. Some municipalities will receive record increases, such as Saint-Prex in canton Vaud, where the commune’s electricity bill is set to rise by 1,600% from CHF70,000 to CHF1.3 million.\n\nBasic food items, such as cooking oil or pasta, are about 10% more expensive in Switzerland. And price increases for such things are starting to have an impact on household budgets. According to the Federal Statistical OfficeExternal link (OFS), each Swiss household spent an average of CHF535 on food every month during the first quarter of 2020, compared to CHF586 during the second quarter of 2022. During this period, the average share of income spent on food rose from 5.5% to 6%.\n\nExternal Content\n\nAnother major expense for Swiss residents that is not included in the consumer price index is compulsory health insurance. Experts say health insurance premiums should rise by 5-10% in 2023 ‒ while they fell by 0.2% in 2022 and increased by 0.5% in 2021.\n\nWages have so far not followed the upward trend. In 2021, a slight decline in salaries on top of inflation caused employees to lose 0.8% of their purchasing power, according to OFSExternal link. Figures for 2022 are not yet available.\n\nCan the Swiss endure price increases?\n\nSwiss salaries are, on average, higher than in most other countries. The share of monthly income spent on food and energy is lower in Switzerland than elsewhere, explains Mathieu Grobéty. “In Switzerland, they represent 20% of the average monthly basket, versus 30% in the eurozone,” he says.\n\nBut inflation has a disproportionate impact on low-income households and on people who spend much of their monthly budget on energy.\n\n“Inflation acts like a tax,” Grobéty says. “Overnight, some households see their income cut by over 3.5%, as they consume a greater share of products whose prices have increased the most.”\n\nWhat measures exist to safeguard purchasing power, and are they effective?\n\nAs prices have soared, several countries have adopted emergency measures. These include discounts on fuel and rent and energy price caps. In France pensions and the salaries of civil servants and certain social benefits have been re-evaluated, while in Germany officials have introduced vouchers to spend on energy or transport subsidies.\n\n“All non-targeted measures taken by governments to maintain purchasing power, such as fuel discounts, can be counterproductive,” says Grobéty. “They will stimulate demand. But central banks are trying to reduce demand to contain inflationary pressures.”\n\nGrobéty believes energy vouchers can also have a perverse effect.\n\n“Higher prices are a very effective way of bringing about changes in behaviour to achieve climate goals,” he comments.\n\nHe says the ideal way would be to target the small groups of people who need help via tax deductions, subsidies or vouchers - provided they can be spent on things other than energy.\n\nWhat’s the situation in Switzerland?\n\nThe ball is now in the Swiss parliament’s court. A special parliamentary session is planned for September 21 and 26 to debate various proposals, mainly from left-wing and centre-right parties.\n\nParliamentarians will be examining whether to urgently adapt pensions to compensate for rising prices and to increase the federal subsidies towards health insurance premiums for low-income households. A temporary “energy allowance” for the most-vulnerable households, and a “federal voucher” for middle-classes will also be discussed.\n\nParliamentarians from the conservative-right Swiss People’s Party oppose such measures, which they say are too expensive. Instead, they advocate tax relief as well as the abolition of taxes on heating oil and ending the rental value tax for pensioners.\n\nSo far, the Federal Council has refused to intervene and opposes all proposals made. The majority of the seven cabinet ministers believes that inflation is bearable, as economic growth continues and unemployment is historically low [at 2%]. It also believes that some of the proposed measures are too broad and could be counterproductive and costly for federal finances.\n\n(Translated from French by Simon Bradley)\n\nArticles in this story A global stress test for freedom of expression\n\nIn compliance with the JTI standards\n\nMore: SWI swissinfo.ch certified by the Journalism Trust Initiative",

    "On environmental issues, the city-country divide in Switzerland is smaller than often assumed": "Switzerland. Credit: Unsplash/CC0 Public Domain\n\nWe like to perpetuate the idea of a divide in the attitudes of city dwellers and country people as part of debates on the environment, but it's simply not the reality, explains Thomas Bernauer. In fact, there is little evidence of a fundamental urban-rural disconnect in Swiss environmental policy.\n\nOn one side, we have the conservative country people. They go full throttle in their car, but when comes to the climate and biodiversity, they step on the brake. On the other side, we have the left-green city dwellers; preachers of climate action while remaining the biggest fans of flying. People often take advantage of these city-countryside clichés as a way of explaining the debate surrounding environmental policy and polling. They promote the image of a deep societal divide between rural objectors (who would rather protect their own interests than the environment) and the sanctimonious urbanites (who demand a green revolution, but do little to contribute towards it).\n\nThis environmental policy gap recently became extremely prominent with the introduction of the CO 2 law and the drinking water and pesticide initiative. Opinion polls and the media have also identified a divide in the forthcoming initiative against factory farming, with the rural population against and the urban population in favor of the proposed action.\n\nWhat truth is there to this (supposed) city-countryside eco-divide? The issue is complex and I will start by saying that I find such rhetoric misleading since there is very little empirical evidence for this contradiction. But first things first.\n\nNot so different after all\n\nMy research group as part of the Swiss Environment Panel used surveys and voting results to investigate whether there is an environmental policy divide between rural and urban populations.\n\nSwiss Environmental Panel\n\nWorking with the Federal Office for the Environment, researchers from ETH Zurich have surveyed several thousands randomly selected people in Switzerland about their attitudes to various environmental policy issues and their behavior twice a year since 2018. More on the Swiss Environmental Panel and a report on city-countryside differences is available here.\n\nOur survey data shows that almost no relevant differences exist between settlement areas in terms of environment-related attitudes and behavior. Of course, attitudes towards environmental issues are much less pronounced in extremely rural places than in larger cities. People surveyed in the countryside also tend to own and drive cars more and eat more meat, while those in the city tend to fly more. Overall, however, environment-related attitudes and behavior patterns are very similar—there is practically no evidence of a city-countryside divide.\n\nIsolated differences at the ballot box\n\nBy contrast, we have seen a slight differentiation in voting behavior in national votes on environmental issues since 2010—but only between extremely rural regions and highly urbanized areas. However, with an average deviation of no more than eight percent till 2020 (12% from 2020 to 2021) between both settlement area types at the extreme ends of the spectrum, it is a stretch to claim a fundamental chasm between city and countryside.\n\nIf we consider the last 20 years and include all nine area types, the difference between city and countryside is small and, rather surprisingly, even slightly smaller than is the case for all national votes together.\n\nThat said, recently there have been certain initiatives relating directly to agriculture or fossil fuels that have resulted in wildly different voting behavior between city and countryside. These include the Swiss hunting law, which saw a difference of 18.9%, the CO 2 law (17.8%), the drinking water initiative (15.4%) and the pesticide initiative (14.5%).\n\nHowever, to conclude from this that urban and rural populations are polarized on environmental issues in Switzerland is, in my opinion, based on the voting behavior of the past 20 years and the survey data collected by the Swiss Environmental Panel since 2018, speculative and largely false.\n\nExplore further In cities, a higher income means more protection against noise pollution",
    "Near the Swiss border with Italy, vestiges of the past are set in stone": "Listen 12 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nBleary-eyed, I left French-speaking Geneva at daybreak. At lunchtime, I switched trains in Zurich, stammering through my rusty grammar-school-level German. A few hours south through the Saint-Gotthard Massif — at almost 11,000 feet, a once formidable obstacle between northern and southern Europe — and, via the longest railway tunnel in the world, I stepped into a balmy summer afternoon in Ticino, the only Italian-speaking canton in Switzerland.\n\nIn just a few hours spent in the resort town of Locarno, just about six miles from the border with Italy, it was clear that Ticino’s reputation as the sunniest canton was completely warranted. Lush palm trees, dark-green camellia shrubs and pastel-colored facades give it a gentle Mediterranean feel. But that was not what I was seeking. After too much time in New York, I was aching for Alpine meadows, ancient forests and the rural landscape of my Swiss childhood. What I found were vivid traces of an ancient mountain people’s enduring struggle against the rocky backdrop of their lives.\n\nI recently stumbled upon the writings of mountaineer and author Douglas W. Freshfield, who, in 1875, published “Italian Alps: Sketches in the Mountains of Ticino, Lombardy, The Trentino, and Venetia” and wrote, “We feel disposed to cry out with delight before a figure of Michael Angelo or this view in Val Maggia.” Even though I had been to Ticino before, I had never heard of that particular valley. It was enough to send me packing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA main artery for the Maggia River, the valley leads from the high summits of the Lepontine Alps to Lake Maggiore below, but it also breaks into more than 10 smaller canyons. The small town of Maggia, about 11 miles north of Locarno and off the main road, seemed to provide the perfect home-base location. Though it’s possible to use the yellow buses that offer public transportation throughout the area, I opted to rent a car and spend a few days exploring the valleys.\n\nYou don’t ease into Val Maggia. One bend in the road, and you plunge into a radically different landscape: Silvery cliffs reach down as if to restrain the flow of emerald-green water rushing about 70 feet below under Ponte Brolla, settling into deep, tranquil pools. Turns out this is the departure point for several hikes and has been the site of a cliff-diving championship.\n\nThe weather shifts fast, and as I drove, nature donned a darker, mysterious robe. Seeming to reflect the ominous clouds, the vertical rock was everywhere: in the towering promontory that frames the valley, in the traditional stone tiles that protect the roofs, in the prehistoric landslides that have marked the history of this land. So much so that its inhabitants have literally carved their lives into the many massive boulders and caves.\n\nIn the hamlet of Cevio Vecchio, I climbed through stone, moss and the odd palm tree toward more than 60 “grotti,” ancient caves carved into the rock. Thanks to a natural system of ventilation, the caves enjoy the right humidity levels to allow the population to use them to store wine, cured meats and local cheeses. Over time, people got into the habit of bringing out tables and sitting in front of the grotti to drink local wine and have a bite to eat. That habit led to the emergence of the present-day grotti, open-air eateries featuring local specialties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Life here was so harsh in those times,” said Flavio Zappa, a historian and guide, over risotto that night, “that starting in the 1850s and until World War I, waves of emigration led generations of men to Australia and California.” Some, like the Lafranchi family of Nicasio Valley Cheese in Marin County, settled there. Others came back and built the many “palazzi dei emigrati,” houses designed on the models encountered overseas. “While away, they sent money to the struggling women and children left behind,” Zappa said, “but the departures of the men created an imbalance of population that would only correct itself a century later.”\n\nThe next day, as if opening the cavern of Ali Baba, Zappa unlocked the heavy wooden door of Santa Maria delle Grazie, a seemingly simple church. Only about 20 minutes on foot from Maggia, it revealed strikingly colorful floor-to-ceiling Renaissance frescoes telling the story of Mary, as well as a whole series of ex-votos commissioned by locals to honor the Madonna.\n\nI had planned to take the cable car all the way to the Robièi area near the Basòdino glacier, but the wind picked up: A storm front was blowing in. Soon the fog hid the peaks, and a torrential downpour sent me back to seek cover at a local cafe. “An end-of-the-world kind of weather,” commented a fellow traveler as she settled into a cozy armchair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy plans did not include staying put, though. I drove back to Ponte Brolla and from there headed west within the Onsernone Valley where, centuries ago, as many as 27 water mills hummed along the river. In the tiny village of Vergeletto, I visited Ilario Garbani, a retired teacher who, in association with the Museum Onsernonese, was working to revive the ancestral tradition of farina bóna, a finely ground roasted corn flour. The storm was just above us, and the furious torrent rushed past the renovated water mill. Here, too, I noted that locals had learned to harness the power of nature to aid their daily lives. At the lovely Ristorante della Posta Russo in nearby Russo, I savored farina bóna ice cream, amaretti and shortbreads, the powder adding a unique, roasted whiff of the past.\n\nIt was time, the next day, to drive north from Maggia toward the mountains. The forest grew thicker on both sides of the road — birches, chestnuts, clusters of pines. To the sound of distant cowbells near the entrance of Val Lavizzara, I stopped in the stunning village of Brontallo, where dark wood and stone chalets — homes to the right and stables to the left — huddled together just below walls of rock.\n\nCowbells gave way to the syncopated rhythm of mallets hitting stone as I proceeded farther toward the summits, where tears of white marble emerged within the gray layers of gneiss above the School of Sculpture in Peccia. The village is also home to the International Sculpture Center, where I met artists from all over the world, selected by an international committee from a wide pool of applicants, now spending several months on an artistic retreat sponsored by the center.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore lunch at nearby Grotto Pozzasc, built on the site of an ancient water mill, families bathed and relaxed on the flat stones that dot the turquoise Peccia River. I was too hungry to wait. I ordered the smooth local merlot, which one drinks directly from an individual pitcher, and which paired perfectly with polenta cooked on an open fire and a whole trout poached, then marinated in wine, a method used in the past to conserve the fish. I couldn’t resist the torta di pane, a sweet cake with dried fruits and cinnamon traditionally made with stale bread.\n\nThat afternoon, I drove to the village of Mogno, where, in 1986, an avalanche destroyed many structures, including a 1626 church. Renowned architect Mario Botta, a Ticino native, was asked to build a new San Giovanni Battista church. From the outside, the small building, made of alternate layers of Peccia marble and local granite, resembles a sort of standing cylinder cut diagonally to the sky. Designed to physically resist nature’s force and to represent the ancestral battle between humankind and the mountain, the tiny church reveals the magnitude of its own power inside. In utter silence, daylight filtered through granite arches and the skylights, seemingly bouncing from marble to glass. As decor, only the lone figure of a wooden Jesus hangs over the altar. Stunning.\n\nWalking the next day through Val Bavona and its 12 terre — ancient hamlets and dwellings, most of them still off the electrical grid — brought together the beauty of the rocky landscape and the desperate efforts of the people who attempted to survive there. With high pastures, where many spent the summers with their animals, and the mouth of the powerful waterfalls along the way, I often wondered whether what I saw was nature (a piece of the mountain) or the moss-covered roof of an antique granary.\n\nLater on, I stopped for a guided tour of the fascinating Museum of Valmaggia, itself carved within a massive boulder. Depicting the old way of life in the area, the museum offered a moving testimony to the struggles of the local population. One room was dedicated to the women who, after the departure of the men, were often left to juggle household and farm work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI had come to Val Maggia in search of nature, but the discreet valleys revealed much more than beautiful Alpine landscapes. Under the rock, a society had emerged, fought its way through the elements and left us a fascinating piece of Swiss culture.\n\nBigar is a writer based in New York City. Her website is sbigar.com.

    "With A ‘Done Deal’ In Switzerland, The F-35 Is Pushing Europe’s Fighter Makers Off Their Own Territory": "A U.S. Air Force F-35A soars over the Swiss Alps during the Air2030 fighter replacement evaluation. Armasuisse\n\nThe Swiss government’s signature on a final purchase contract for the F-35 and the withdrawal of a public referendum on the purchase of 36 of the jets this week signal a William Tell-esque bullseye for Lockheed Martin LMT and a real blow to Europe’s fighter aircraft manufacturers.\n\nOn Monday the Swiss Federal Armaments Office (Armasuisse) confirmed the final agreement for its $6.2 billion acquisition of 36 F-35A Lightning IIs in spite of an ongoing initiative to force a referendum on the specific choice of F-35. The initiative had gathered enough signatures to trigger a public vote but was withdrawn Tuesday in a surprise move by its organizers.\n\nExplaining the withdrawal, supporters of the ‘Stop F-35A’ initiative said a nationwide vote would be meaningless as it could not change the course of the deal. Co-president of the Social Democrat party for the Canton of Zurich, Priska Seiler Graf, told Swiss public broadcaster SRF, “We are withdrawing the initiative with a heavy heart. We do not want to offer a pseudo vote where voters can’t have a real say in the actual purchase decision.”\n\nBarring possible long-shot legal challenges it appears the Swiss F-35 buy is a fait accompli and a galvanizing win for the F-35 in one of the European countries once viewed as least likely to consider it. But the reality is that most all significant Continental powers from Poland in the east to Norway in the northwest have bought F-35s. Pending purchases by Finland, Germany and the Czech Republic further fill in the map. Add in the nearby U.K. and it’s fair to say that Europe is “F-35 country.”\n\nThe latest news is obviously further fuel to Lockheed Martin, which has said it expects that more than 550 F-35s will be stationed in Europe by 2030. That may not be all.\n\nIn August, Spanish newspaper El País, reported that Spain’s Air Force leadership has recommended buying up to 80 F-35s as a near-term option to replace its aging F/A-18 Hornets and AV-8B Harriers alongside an existing purchase of additional Eurofighter Typhoons.\n\nWith the retirement of Spanish Hornets and Harriers this decade rapidly approaching and delays and political infighting within the Franco-German-Spanish Future Combat Aircraft System (FCAS), Spain’s military leadership acknowledges the obvious; Lockheed’s Lightning II has become NATO’s “de facto” fighter, the only 5th-generation aircraft currently available.\n\nSpain’s government was quick to brush aside El Pais’ report, asserting that it has no budget to enter into any other aircraft project in addition to FCAS. “We ruled out entering into the F-35 project. Our investment commitment is in the FCAS,” a Spanish Defense Ministry spokeswoman said.\n\nBut recent reports of conflict over the workshare, direction and development of the 5th-gen fighter that FCAS is supposed to produce, do not bode well for its realization in anything short of 15 years in the future, if that. During that span the F-35 should be available and, despite its cost and shortcomings, improving.\n\nThe Swiss government’s selection of the F-35 hinged on its lower projected lifetime cost than the 4th and 4.5-generation competitors it was up against, including Dassault’s Rafale and Eurofighter’s Typhoon. The F-35’s interoperability with other NATO air and ground forces has been a strong selling point that on the surface would apply only peripherally to theoretically neutral, non-NATO member Switzerland.\n\nThe Swiss Left-wing coalition that successfully gathered enough signatures to trigger a referendum ... [+] on the choice of the F-35 as the Swiss Air Force' next fighter ultimately dropped its effort after Armasuisse formally committed Switzerland to a final contract.

Even with its strong financial ties to Russia and decades of cordial welcome to Russian oligarchs, Switzerland was as rattled by Putin’s drive for Kyiv as its EU neighbors.\n\n“Putin is unquestionably the best salesman for Western defense equipment of all time. He’s also been amazing at getting neutral countries to either join NATO or just buy NATO standard equipment,” says Richard Aboulafia, managing director of the consulting firm AeroDynamic Advisory.\n\nOthers have pointed out that Russia’s cruel adventurism merely gave an additional boost to the re-capitalization of European fighter fleets already underway from 3rd and 4th to 5th generation aircraft. With Europe’s indigenous efforts late to the party, including the U.K.-Italy Tempest program, the F-35 has been able to fill the void.\n\n“For European defense producers, this [Swiss] development accelerates what they’ve known for some time – their [fighter sales] hopes depend on the Mideast and India and other Indian Ocean clients,” Aboulafia affirms. “With big sales to the UAE UAE and Egypt and India, that’s been fine for Dassault. Can Britain and its partners rise to the challenge with Typhoon and/or Tempest? Will Saudi Arabia come through with a second [Eurofighter] tranche? All of this matters more now, with Europe (aside from Greece) out of reach.”\n\nGreece’s well known financial constraints may preclude an F-35 buy but the country nonetheless made a formal request to procure 20 F-35As by 2028, and Lockheed Martin acknowledged that conversations are ongoing between the company and Greek officials. Athens has also ordered 24 Rafales from Dassault but if its financial picture improves and America-Turkey relations remain strained, it may well turn to Lockheed for further aircraft.\n\nPortugal, a current F-16 operator, may be a minor target for Dassault or Eurofighter given its economy and lackadaisical approach to re-investing in its air force. But Switzerland’s example has shown that Lockheed’s stealth fighter is able to effectively show up and sell itself in unexpected places. It has, for all intents and purposes pushed European fighter makers out of their own territory for at least the next couple decades.\n\nCommander of the Swiss Air Force Major General Peter Merz gestures in front of a F-35 A Lightning II ...

    "How are RVs and new and used cars holding up in Switzerland?": "Webinar: How are residual values and new and used cars holding up in Switzerland?\n\nRead next More collaboration needed across automotive industry to hit climate goals\n\nPaired with supply-chain disruptions and ongoing component shortages, the energy crisis and rising costs of living are impacting automotive markets across Europe. Even Switzerland – one of the world’s most stable vehicle markets – cannot escape these latest developments. So, how are the country’s used and new-car markets holding up and how are residual values (RVs) developing?\n\nThis and other questions were addressed by Eurotax Switzerland (part of the Autovista Group) in its latest webinar, Automotive Trends in Switzerland. Robert Madas (regional head of valuations, Austria, Poland, Switzerland) was joined by Hans-Peter Annen (head of valuations, Switzerland) and Patrick Schneider (deputy valuations and quality manager, Switzerland) to analyse recent market traits.\n\nOne key development is the rising prices of new passenger cars and light-commercial vehicles. As Annen explained, list prices are going up for a number of reasons; there are real price increases and also a change in the model mix. New vehicles are also becoming more connected and carry the latest technology, including advanced-driver assistance systems. Additionally, electrification is having an impact on list prices as battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) tend to be more expensive than their fossil fuel-based counterparts.\n\nDevelopment of list prices for passenger cars, Switzerland, 2013-2022\n\nSource: Autovista Group\n\nAs is well known, 2019 was the last ‘normal’ year for the automotive industry. New-car registrations have seen steep declines since COVID-19 disrupted markets in 2020 and 2021. While some had hoped for a recovery in 2022, the war in Ukraine is fuelling further uncertainty. Switzerland is less reliant on Russian gas than neighbouring Germany, with inflation being significantly lower than elsewhere in Europe, but a sense of disillusion remains.\n\nThere are ongoing concerns that the current energy crisis could negatively impact the further development of electromobility. The Swiss automotive industry association Auto-Schweiz said this month that in the short term, the country’s power supply for the coming winter must be secured ‘through effective measures on the production side and through sensible savings on the consumption side.’\n\nThe body emphasised that in the medium to long term, the nation should push ahead with the expansion of low-CO 2 domestic electricity production to become as independent as possible, and also to power EVs. The association monitors new-car registrations in Switzerland, which have seen further declines this year.\n\nImprovement not in sight\n\n‘Since 2020, we have recorded historically low new-car registrations. In 2022, too, new-car registrations have so far lagged behind the unsatisfactory levels of the two previous years. An improvement is not in sight under these conditions,’ said Annen.\n\nNew-car registrations have dropped by 30% from January to August this year, compared to the same period in 2019. The share of new petrol and diesel passenger cars continues to shrink while BEVs, hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs), and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) have grown significantly in the past three years. Their combined market share has reached almost 49% so far this year. Meanwhile, LCV registrations are significantly down in 2022 – the second time since the pandemic hit, Annen cautioned.\n\nMaking up ground\n\nFewer vehicles on the new-car market mean fewer cars on the used-car market, which started to recover in 2021, nudging up 1.1% year on year. However, things are different in 2022. During the first half of the year, 390,649 cars changed ownership compared to 426,971 during the same period in the prior year, marking a notable decline.\n\nChanges of ownership for passenger cars, Switzerland, January-June 2013-2022\n\nSource: Autovista Group\n\n‘This confirms that the low number of new-car registrations since 2020 has had a negative impact on changes of ownership, as there is simply no new supply,’ said Schneider. But is it all doom and gloom?\n\n‘Hybrids, battery-electric vehicles, and plug-in hybrids are continuing to make up ground and can gain market share. In the passenger-car segment, offers have recovered somewhat and offer days have increased again,’ added Schneider.\n\nUsed LCVs have not quite reached the same level during the first half of 2022 compared to 2021 but are still above levels seen in 2020. Motorhomes in particular have gained market share, with Schneider saying that the supply of second-hand LCVs has been stable for months, albeit at a low level.\n\nHigher RVs expected in 2022\n\nMadas highlighted some residual-values trends. ‘By the end of 2022, we expect higher residual values for all fuel types,’ he said.\n\nFor 36-month-old vehicles, Madas is anticipating a year-on-year rise of 11%. He noted that RVs of young BEVs, ranging from 12-36 months, have seen a particular increase. Among 12-month-old cars, BEVs even take first place in terms of RV retention, with a retail value of 82.3% on average. Apart from BEVs, RVs of older cars, those exceeding four to five years of age, as well as diesel cars, have seen the steepest rise.\n\nRV trends in Switzerland since January 2020\n\nSource: Autovista Group\n\nDemand has remained relatively stable so far and supply is inching up, too, despite long delivery times and fewer new cars entering the market. However, as the demand side starts to weaken already, pressure on RVs is to be expected.\n\nOffer prices continued to rise during the first six months of 2022 but are now stabilising. On average, prices are up 16% compared to February 2020. Looking further ahead, however, RVs are projected to decline slightly in 2023.\n\nFind the full slide deck for the presentation (in German) below.

Switzerland’s central bank has carried out the biggest hike ever to its key interest rate in an effort to clamp down on inflation.

The Swiss National Bank said in a statement Thursday that it could not rule out further increases beyond the increase of three-quarters of a percentage point rise “to ensure price stability over the medium term.” (Michael Buholzer/Keystone via AP)\n\nGENEVA (AP) — Switzerland’s central bank carried out the biggest hike ever to its key interest rate Thursday, following the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks around the world in aggressive moves to clamp down on inflation.\n\nThe Swiss National Bank could not rule out that further increases beyond the rise of three-quarters of a percentage point “will be necessary to ensure price stability over the medium term,” said Thomas Jordan, chairman of SNB governing board.\n\nIt aims to cool off inflation that came in at 3.5% in August, which is much lower than the record 9.1% in the 19 neighboring European Union countries that use the euro.\n\nThe Swiss rate increased from minus 0.25% to 0.5%, ending several years of negative interest rates — a testament to the stable growth, low-inflation environment, coupled with Switzerland’s appeal as a safe haven for assets.\n\nIn essence, that negative interest rate environment meant that people who parked assets in Switzerland paid for the privilege, a counterintuitive idea for many investors who might expect a return on their savings.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSome economists have said that Switzerland appeared less vulnerable to inflation pressures because the cost of living in the wealthy Alpine country is relatively high compared to its main neighbors: European Union countries.\n\nA recent surge in the value of the Swiss franc compared to the euro, for example, has caused many Swiss consumers to cross the border into neighboring countries like France or Germany to buy gasoline and other consumer goods that suddenly are relatively less expensive there.\n\nJordan said the bank would “intervene in foreign exchange markets to steer monetary conditions” if “exchange rate movements are excessive so that you have a massive appreciation” in the franc.\n\nThe Swiss currency dropped more than 1% against the euro after the bank’s announcement, with economists saying some investors may have expected an even bigger hike.\n\nThe move comes a day after the Fed raised its key rate by three-quarters of a point for the third consecutive time and signaled that more increases were ahead.\n\nThe European Central Bank also hiked by that much earlier this month, and the Bank of England is under pressure to move aggressively at its meeting Thursday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSwitzerland is not an EU member, but most of its economic activity is done with the giant 27-nation bloc.\n\nSwiss-EU ties have been strained in recent years over issues including more than 100 bilateral agreements that the two sides have struggled to renew and demands of some populist politicians in Switzerland to limit the number of EU citizens who can live and work in the country. That concept greatly unsettles Brussels, because one of the EU’s central principles is free circulation of people within its member states’ territories and with other partners in the so-called Schengen zone.",

    "Why Switzerland Hates You (and Why She Should) ~ The Imaginative Conservative": "Switzerland remains feisty, free, and a bright beacon in a dark age for a collapsing civilization that should be looking to its example. For those weaned on the open-borders, Leftist humanitarian brainwashing of modern times, here are a few rules from the Singapore of Central Europe.\n\n“When all the world is socialist, Switzerland will have to remain capitalist, so that it can tell us the price of everything.”– Nikita Khrushchev\n\nDuring the great days of my salon monarchism and alpine anarchism while living in street clean Wien, I traveled with the beloved Graf so-and-so by car from the Salzkammergutl to Zurich past many a forlorn castle and mighty monastery to check in on family Schwarzgeld held here and there in attractive old banks run by the same Catholic families two hundred years on. In those days I roomed with an astute German princess whose sister had been part of the July 20 plot against Hitler and I wrote various stories for the Herald Tribune and Wall Street Journal Europe about the post-war confiscation of art and lands of the Austro-Hungarian ancien regime under scurrilous pretexts of EU legal cloak-and-daggerism. Thus, among these friends there prevailed a mentality of seeing oneself orphaned from history and, as a result, ‘The State’ could in no way be trusted—what with socialists, communists and Freimauer types leering at you from behind every foggy Jugendstil street lamp. This attitude included a rather sacrosanct insistence upon guarding one’s wealth, or what remained of it, within ye olde financial secrecy rules of the proud Confederation next door, despite the general trend internationally that the party was truly over by the mid 2000s. I was fascinated by what seemed to be a permanent fin-de-siècle, Stefan Zweig-esque melodrama that anxiously wound its way through the psyche of these characters, all of whom suffered from that very Central European trauma known as Erbsunde. This roughly translates as the inherited psychological state of one’s ancestors; a secular brand of original sin that comes with being at war with the world every sixty years or so and an outlook that regards History, capital-’H’, as a prison through which one entered by many doors, not one of them offering an exit.\n\nIt was this combination of Spenglerian dread mixed with Dr. Mabuse’s prophetic evil grin mixed with the rough splinters of noble pride still stabbing at the Habsburgian heart that compelled these members of a collapsed civilization to cast a hopeful gaze to the arrogant democracy next door—to its love of privacy, its respect for meritocracy, its love of order and cultural continuity. A country that was and remains solid, stable and secretive; a safe haven of I-told-you-so European high standards. That doesn’t need you, want you or care what you think. Today, members of another collapsing civilization should be looking to its example as well.\n\nI now live in northern Italy and my Lugano-born, Milan-raised husband stresses his Lombardian affinities to Switzerland with a rapture as intense as his contempt for gracious and degraded Rome. Many memories of one’s clean, beautiful public hospital room like a private club with gourmet food and tranquil views. Wistful respect for the cultural ministry that will long-lease to you an unclaimed castle if you give it an art collection. Paying for your sandwich with a 500 note and no one blinking an eye. The competing cantons whose modern battles consist of offering businesses lower taxes and better educated workers. The half-dozen private bankers (a special status beyond “bank”) that adhere to the 1934 laws requiring the total personal liability of its partners, high cash reserves and that do not permit speculative investment. The stately national newspaper that is still an objective, high-brow print newspaper. The Sunday laws against noise and work. The thrill of disbelief in being fined for J-walking or cited for using a non-approved color of garbage bag at your apartment building, or of police stopping at someone’s home when the wash is not hung out tidily. Of course, one does not simply “move to Switzerland”: a visa and passport generally take fifteen years, with some notable exceptions, and even then the inhabitants of your county district must vote to approve of your staying there. Ach, Du lieber Himmel!\n\nAnd for those weaned on the open-borders, gauchiste humanitarian brainwashing of modern times, here are a few rules from the Singapore of Central Europe:\n\nIf you enter Switzerland illegally, you are thrown back out, no exceptions. If you manage to slip through illegally and you commit a crime, you must pay for your jail time—the shelter, the food that consumes tax money. How is this paid? Forced labor, dear.\n\nSwitzerland has a zero-tolerance approach to homelessness. There are ‘homeless’, who tend to be of the minority-formerly-called gypsy variety, but they are fined and warned and forced to leave. Last year, Basel announced a program whereby homeless individuals would be given a one way ticket to any other European city and twenty Swiss francs if they promised never to return–at least for four years (This proved very popular). Violators are deported.\n\nBegging on the streets is illegal, for which one is fined hundreds of francs. In Geneva in 2015, a Roma woman, not able to pay several fines for begging that amounted to around 500 CHF, received a sentence of five days in prison in that city. The globalist cabal of the soi-disant European Court of Human Rights demanded that Geneva overturn its decision, maintaining with its brand of looney logic that begging is an expression of ‘human dignity’. The city was told to pay her close to 1000 CHF in ‘damages’. Nonetheless, Swiss law enforcement throughout all the cantons continues to fine begging\n\nIf you are employed and then become unemployed in Switzerland, your name is put in a central database with your qualifications and background in your canton. That canton will then start to send you notifications of job offers commensurate with your work history and education. You are allowed to reject two of these offers. If you reject the third you must leave the country, unless you can prove at once enough wealth to sustain your livelihood for a specified amount of time.\n\nIf you become unemployed in Switzerland, the state will give you, for a short while, welfare benefits. Once you are employed, you must pay the welfare back. No living off of the public trough. If you refuse this you must leave the country.\n\nCorporate taxes are the competitive open-field between the twenty-six cantons. These are federal, cantonal and communal. The federal (national) corporate tax rate is a flat 8%; the cantons determine the rest individually. For all federal, cantonal and communal corporate taxes combined, you are looking at a range of 11.9% to 21.6%. The VAT is one of the lowest in Europe although import and customs duties are high.\n\nThere are very strict Sunday laws. Sunday is considered sacred–not just in religious terms but as a matter of civic respect. You aren’t allowed to mow the grass, you can’t hang laundry, and you cannot recycle your trash. If you are caught sending out the trash on Sunday to one of the centers close to you, you will be fined. If you cannot pay the fine, you can choose the option of a few days in jail.\n\nGood Samaritan laws are still in place. If you see something happen or someone in trouble, the least you are required to do is to call the police. The failure to do so can get you in hot water.\n\nMemo to San Francisco: In an attempt to liberalize the drug laws, the Platzspitz or “Needle Park” in Zurich was an open drugs scene in the 1980s and early 90s when heroin users could inject the drug without being arrested and volunteer doctors supplied the needles. The scene spun horribly out of control with the number of drug-related deaths in Switzerland increasing twelvefold between 1975 and 1992. Authorities shut it down that year, with a heavy gate built across the park.\n\nThat famous healthcare system is expensive and you pay mostly out of pocket, reimbursed later. Even though Switzerland’s healthcare system is universal, there is no free public healthcare. Instead, all residents of Switzerland must pay for their own private health insurance. There is no Medicare. Subsidies are provided in extreme cases (poverty, the infirm) with strict conditions, including the recipient having to pay back those subsidies eventually. Once voluntary, insurance coverage has been compulsory since 1996.\n\nAnd yes–Switzerland still has National Service in the armed forces, where each able-bodied Swiss man has to spend time each year in a training camp that forms part of the military. Soldiers must keep a gun in their home, which is a part of the military framework in readiness for potential conflict\n\nNaturally, things are not perfect. The repeal of its famous neutrality to denounce Russia’s attacks on Ukraine, the climate-change politics, “Davos”, the perennial Socialist politician wanting more central government etc. disappoint. But the country remains feisty, free, and a bright beacon in a dark age. Since winning their independence in a series of bloody battles against Habsburg Austria in the 14th century and then Burgundy in the 15th century using that famed phalanx fighting style, the Swiss aren’t to be messed with. Machiavelli regarded them as the epitome of efficient soldiers. Rich in brains, poor in natural resources, and with a reputation for discipline, the Swiss were chosen in 1506 to be the protectors of the spiritual leader of the Western world, a role lasting through to this day.

    "Switzerland shows the many faces of inflation": "Switzerland shows the many faces of inflation Henrique Schneider\n\nWhile the prosperous nation of 9 million people has seemingly low inflation, monetary policy mistakes have eroded purchasing power and clouded its economic future.\n\nA cafe terrace surrounded by residential apartment buildings in the old town district of Geneva, Switzerland on August 3, 2022. The overvalued Swiss residential real estate market is at risk of a large and abrupt price correction if interest rates rise quickly, according to Switzerland’s central bank. © Getty Images\n\n× In a nutshell Lax monetary policy failed to weaken the currency or prevent deflation\n\nNegative interest rates reduced the value of pension fund assets\n\nBest-case scenario: A short recession that corrects inflated prices\n\nSwitzerland has a reputation for responsible fiscal and monetary policies. The reported inflation rate of 3.4 percent in June 2022 seems to corroborate this image, especially when compared with 8.6 percent in the eurozone and 9.1 percent in the United States. The problem with this picture is: It is wrong.\n\nThe Swiss reality is, instead, marked by an ultra-lax monetary policy and a decrease in purchasing power since 2015. The Swiss situation serves as a case study for the many faces of inflation, a multifaceted phenomenon barely captured by inflation rates.\n\nInflation denotes an increase in the money supply not supported by an increase in the production of goods and services. Increasing money supply without real collateral just makes the bank’s balance sheets unjustifiably larger. This leads to a loss of purchasing power.\n\nThis loss, however, does not occur uniformly throughout the economy. Prices of some goods may increase faster than others, leading to a greater disparity in the relative prices of goods. Also, the increase of prices is just one manifestation of the loss of purchasing power, alongside skyrocketing valuations of real estate or exchange-traded securities and negative interest rates.\n\nIn other words, looking at the consumer price index as a proxy for inflation does not convey the entire picture. Inflation, the bloating of the money supply, shows itself in different ways in different sectors of the economy.\n\nSwitzerland’s bubble\n\nIn a bid to consciously weaken the Swiss franc, the Swiss Central Bank engaged in a prolonged phase of easy monetary policy. In January 2010, the Swiss Monetary Base Aggregate was about 87,000 million francs. By January 2020, it was around 589,000 million, peaking at approximately 757,000 in April 2022, with only a slight decline since then. In 12 years, the monetary base expanded 8.7 times.\n\nThis unprecedented bloat was initially championed on so-called technical grounds. The central bank, seen as committed to price stability, wanted to fight impending deflation. (One might ask, why? Deflation, the gain in purchasing power, can be economically viable. But this is a question for a different paper.) Increasingly, the bank’s true aims became clearer. Weakening the Swiss franc was a political move by a politically motivated central bank aiming at helping exporters through devaluation. Since the onset of this policy in 2010, its balance sheet expanded at unprecedented rates. As it proved unsustainable, the central bank decided to change its modus operandi by introducing a negative policy short-term interest rate. In the beginning of 2015, this rate went from 0.25 percent to -0.75 percent. Since then, it has stayed negative. Even after a very modest hike in June 2022, it still is -0.25 percent.\n\n× Facts & figures Swiss becoming less optimistic about the economy In Switzerland, the KOF Swiss Economic Institute economic barometer measures the level of optimism that people who run companies have about the performance of the economy. It fell to 90.1 in July 2022, part of a steady decline from its peak of 143.6 but far higher than its low of 49.6.\n\nFailed goals\n\nNeither of the intended goals was realized. The Swiss franc appreciated against the euro, breaking parity in 2022, and since then becoming slightly more valuable than the European currency. The central bankers wanted to keep the Swiss currency at what they called the “fair” exchange rate of 1.20 franc per euro. Central bankers also failed regarding their other goal. Between 2010 and 2020, the yearly inflation rate measured by the consumer price index was six times negative – in other words, deflationary. In the other six years, it remained below 1 percent, and therefore below the policy band of 1-2 percent.\n\nHousing prices climbed in real terms, making life less affordable.\n\nCentral bankers enlarging the currency supply neither maintained the Swiss franc in its “fair” exchange rate vis-a-vis the euro nor achieved their goal of fighting deflation. But this is only half the story of the Swiss failure. The other half is marked by the sectors in which a tremendous loss of purchasing power occurred – due to the machinations of the central bank.\n\nCollateral damage\n\nAlongside the inflation of the Swiss money supply, the country’s residential house price index went from about 130 points in 2010 to 190 in 2021. This represents an increase of over 46 percent or about 4 percent per year. This is much more than the development of wages, which are, on average, corrected by the consumer price index. The result is that housing prices climbed in real terms. With them, rents and other real estate-related prices made life less affordable, especially for the middle class.\n\nThen, the Swiss Market Index went from around 6,500 points at the beginning of 2010 to about 12,900 at the end of 2021; even after all the turmoil of this year, it is still over 11,100 points. At its highest point, the market for exchange-traded shares almost doubled. It still trades about 70 percent higher than in 2010. In the same period, the Swiss economy grew by some 20 percent. Again, this difference is a sign that the increased monetary base did not enter the real economy, as was hoped for, but remained in financial markets, causing asset price inflation.\n\nThe reason for the seemingly low inflation rate in Switzerland is the failure of central bankers to devaluate the Swiss franc.\n\nA third way in which the central bank’s inflationary policy diffused was via the pension system. One of the main reasons for the Swiss being relatively well-off is the mandatory but defined-contribution system of retirement provision. Currently, the whole system has around 1.3 trillion francs under management. The negative interest rate cut away some of these assets. First, the negative rates were applied to the pension scheme’s liquidity. Second, it lowered the bond market into negative territory as well as reduced the returns of the pension funds. Third, it led many funds to seek risks that were not appropriately remunerated by premiums. Negative interest rates chipped away at least 50 billion francs of the plan contributions.",
    "Switzerland picks site near German border for nuclear waste storage": "Swiss authorities have selected a site in northern Switzerland not far from the German border to host a deep geological storage repository for radioactive waste.\n\nAfter nearly 50 years of searching for the best way to store its radioactive waste, Switzerland is gearing up for its “project of the century”, entailing burying spent nuclear fuel deep underground in clay.\n\nThe organisation in charge of handling the country’s radioactive waste said on Saturday it had decided that the Nördlich Lägern region was the best of three sites it had been considering for the underground storage facility.\n\nOfficials “chose Nördlich Lägern as the safest site for a deep geological repository,” Felix Glauser, a spokesperson for the National Cooperative for the Disposal of Radioactive Waste (Nagra), told AFP in an email, confirming a report by the Swiss news agency Keystone-ATS.\n\n“Extensive investigations have shown that Nördlich Lägern is the most suitable site and has the largest safety reserves,” he added.\n\nNagra has informed the local population directly and is expected to present its proposal to the Swiss government on Monday, Keystone-ATS reported.\n\nThe Swiss government is not due to make the final decision until 2029, but that is unlikely to be the last word as the issue would probably go to a referendum under Switzerland’s direct democracy system.\n\nSwiss nuclear power plants have been pumping out radioactive waste for more than half a century. After the 2011 nuclear accident at the Fukushima power station in Japan, Switzerland decided to phase out nuclear power gradually: its reactors can continue for as long as they remain safe.\n\nFor now, the waste is being stored in an intermediary depot in Würenlingen, 9.3 miles (15km) from the German border.\n\nWith the new facility, Switzerland hopes to join an elite club of countries closing in on deep geological storage. So far only Finland has built a site, in granite. Sweden gave the green light in January to build its own site for burying spent nuclear fuel in granite. France also has plans to store radioactive waste underground in clay.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

    "How A Trek Through Switzerland Inspired J.R.R. Tolkien To Create A Magical Middle-Earth": "Staubbach waterfall, Lauterbrunnen, Switzerland getty\n\nI made a plan to journey into Middle Earth to follow in the footsteps of a young J.R.R. Tolkien. “From Rivendell to the other side of the Misty Mountains,” he once wrote, “the journey... including the glissade down the slithering stones into the pine woods... is based on my adventures in Switzerland in 1911.”\n\nMy goal was to head southwest, past the sharp snowy peaks glimpsed through misty mountains that overlook Lucerne and the lake town of Interlaken. I would venture into the dark green valley from Lake Thun into the Bernese Oberland area. I would be searching for Elfs and hobbits in hopes that Rivendell would be a place I could rest.\n\nExperts believe that the inspiration for Tolkien’s legendary Middle Earth tomes, The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, were all taken from this spectacular region in Switzerland. The Alpine villages are all protected by the famed Jungfrau peak. For years hikers have been visiting these valleys in hopes of recreating the Lord of the Rings experience.\n\nJungfrau peak, at Kleine Scheidegg, Switzerland getty\n\nBefore visiting the area I wanted to educate myself more to the background of John Ronald Reuel Tolkien (1892-1973), the former english professor at the University of Oxford, who wrote The Hobbit in 1936, and The Lord of the Rings in 1954. Both of the legendary books were located in the invented world of Middle Earth. But the inspiration for the pre-historic location was inspired from a hiking trip in 1911, when Tolkien was only 19. He trekked through the area as part of a group taking a walking tour in the Swiss Alps. This was the only time he ever visited the majestic area surrounded by its towering mountains and deep valleys, and it stayed with him throughout his life.\n\nTightrope walk between Augstmatthorn and Harder near Interlaken, Bernese Oberland, Switzerland getty\n\nI envisioned wandering through Interlaken at the northern end of the Lauterbrunnen, a gorgeous, deep valley beyond with views of three famous peaks, the Eiger, Monch, and Jungfrau. The views of the mountains and Alpine villages were actually mentioned by Tolkien, “I left the view of Jungfrau with deep regret, and the Silberhorn sharp against dark blue.” Lauterbrunnen in fact is mentioned by numerous historians as Tolkien’s inspiration for Rivendell.\n\nHobbit village getty\n\nAlas, the pandemic idled my planned journey to Middle-Earth, but I continued to examine how Rivendell and the Misty Mountains would inspire countless adventurers to trek along to recreate the journey of a young Tolkien.\n\nI spoke with Greg Witt who operates the popular Alpine Wild walking tour company: “For a 19-year-old orphan living in England who had never seen Alpine peaks, towering waterfalls, tumbling glaciers, and deep-cut glacial valleys, Tolkien’s 1911 summer hiking through the Swiss Alps left an indelible impression. Not only the iconic scenery, but the place names, like Grindelwald, Lauterbrunnen, and Grimsel Pass have a Tolkienesque ring to them.”\n\nHe adds, “The best account of Tolkien’s journey and how it inspired his Middle Earth is Martin Monsch’s book: Switzerland in Tolkien's Middle-Earth: In the footsteps of his adventurous summer journey in 1911-with hiking suggestions. He’s thoroughly documented Tolkien’s route and has uncovered and documented many details I wasn’t aware of.”\n\n“We offer the In the Footsteps of Tolkien tour on demand or for a private group—not as one of our regularly scheduled tours,” he says. “I live in the Jungfrau Region of the Bernese Alps, which features many of the settings which inspired Tolkien. I live at the mouth of Lauterbrunnen Valley, a classic glacial valley ringed by 72 waterfalls plunging over thousand-foot cliffs. I drive up the valley at least once a week and every time consider how that scenery shaped Tolkien’s Rivendell. Tolkien also passed by Trümmelbach Falls, a ten-tiered underground waterfall that would have left a powerful impression on any 19-year-old. His journey took him high into the remote upper Lauterbrunnen Valley where he would have been surrounded by dozens of immense glaciers—something he would have never seen in England.”\n\nAuthor William Bundy shared with me the inspiration of the region, “Tolkien’s Middle Earth is drawn from a variety of influences — the green landscapes of England, the homely beauty of Sarehole Mill, and the bleakness of industry, to name a few. Chiefly though, I think, is the incomparable beauty of nature itself, which was on full display as his party made their way through the Swiss Alps, one of the greatest mountain ranges on Earth.”\n\nThe Dingles Near Sarehole near the village of Sarehole. Heritage Images via Getty Images\n\n“The Misty Mountains form the backbone of his own fictional Middle Earth, and it’s little surprise perhaps that such majestic mountains on his own doorstep would form the inspiration for his own Alps,” he continues. “These mountains often test the characters in his most famous novels, traversing them as a kind of test almost; battling dark forces that threaten to overthrow the entire adventure, and often take them down into deeper places where no lights — or hope (seemingly), are to be found.”\n\n“Back then, in 1911, Tolkien was still embarking on a journey of study and language, and his formative experiences in the trenches of World War I would be several years away. These experiences (in my belief) informed much of the darkness in his Middle Earth creation and led to perhaps other aspects of his legendarium being shaped by environmental factors (the coastline of Holderness for instance).”\n\n“The Hobbit’s (Bilbo’s) journey from Rivendell to the other side of the Misty Mountains…is based on my adventures in 1911…” J.R.R. Tolkien\n\nJohn Ronald Reuel Tolkien Getty Images\n\n“Starting in Interlaken, Tolkien’s group traversed through the landscape to the Lauterbrunnen Valley, a deep valley that many scholars now believe was the direct inspiration for the valley of Rivendell, a place instrumental to events both in The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, home of Elrond, and his council, amongst other things. This interest is manifested in the company Alpenwild, which now runs walking tours following in Tolkien’s footsteps, formed by Greg Witt, and informed by the knowledge of Tolkien expert Alex Lewis.”\n\n“I left the view of Jungfrau with deep regret: eternal snow, etched as it seemed against eternal sunshine, and the Silberhorn sharp against dark blue: the Silvertine (Celebdil) of my dreams.” J.R.R. Tolkien\n\nAccording to the acclaimed writer John Howe, in his preface for the Martin S. Monsch book on Tolkien, “Some alpine landmarks are cited by Tolkien as inspiration, the most explicit being the Silberhorn, a side peak of the Jungfrau.\n\n“It is a reminder – and a bit of a word of warning – that inspiration does not always follow logic,” says Howe, “It was not the obvious and famous mountain trio of Jungfrau, Eiger and Mönch that inspired Tolkien, but rather a side peak of one of these.”\n\nHobbit entrance to the Greisinger Museum Greisinger Museum\n\nHe adds, “Tolkien did not directly lift sections of landscape from the Swiss Alps and sprinkle them across his far vaster Middle-earth, but took back with him a series of vivid and sublime impressions that may well have resurfaced naturally as he wrote.”\n\nIf you get a chance and want to dig really deep into the land of Hobbits, there is the largest collection of Middle-Earth objects at Greisinger Middle Earth Museum in the village of Jenins. The museum houses Bernd Greisinger's private collection focused on Middle-Earth, the world's largest of its kind consisting mostly of art and literature as well as collectors' items. All of the rooms are designed to make you feel like you are a visitor in Middle-Earth. Through the door of the hobbit hole you get into the museum, with rooms that are mostly most underground.\n\n\"Well, here at last, dear friends, on the shores of the sea comes the end of our fellowship in middle-earth. Go in peace!” J.R.R. Tolkien",

    "Switzerland implements further EU sanctions to align itself with the EU": "On 31 August 2022, the Swiss Federal Council decided on the implementation of further EU sanctions (namely the remaining measures of the seventh sanctions package), revising the Ordinance on Measures connected with the Situation in Ukraine (the “Ordinance“) accordingly. These amendments render the Swiss sanctions again in line with the EU sanctions, including on already previously adopted but not yet implemented measures. The amended Ordinance entered into force on 31 August 2022 at 18:00 CET.\n\nIn summary, these latest amendments, the most relevant of which are summarized below, include:\n\nAdjustments to various exemptions;\n\nClarifications of various provisions;\n\nSignificant changes to the deposit restrictions; and\n\nNew public procurement related bans.\n\nDual-use Goods and Goods for Military and Technological Enforcement\n\nThe exemption from the scope of the ban on the sale, supply, export, transit and transport of dual-use goods (Article 4 of the Ordinance) and of goods for military and technological enforcement (Article 5 of the Ordinance), and the provision of related services, for goods and services intended to ensure cybersecurity and information security was removed.\n\nInstead, goods and services intended to ensure cybersecurity and information security may henceforth merely be exceptionally licensed by SECO, and for civilian purposes or civilian end-users only.\n\nGoods for Industrial Strengthening\n\nUnder the ban on the sale, supply, export, transit and transport of goods for industrial strengthening and the provision of related services (Article 11a of the Ordinance), an exceptional license may be granted by SECO only if necessary for:\n\nmedical or pharmaceutical purposes with a non-military end use; humanitarian or evacuation purposes; or the exclusive use by Switzerland to meet its maintenance obligations in areas subject to a long-term lease agreement between Switzerland and the Russian Federation.\n\nLuxury Goods\n\nThe exemption from the scope of the ban on the sale, supply, export, transit and transport of luxury goods listed in Annex 18 (Article 14b of the Ordinance) was extended to jewellery and gold owned and carried by individuals leaving Switzerland destined for private use and not for sale.\n\nThere were also minor amendments to the Annex on luxury goods (Annex 18).\n\nAsset Freeze\n\nAt last, Article 15 of the Ordinance was amended to reflect standard Swiss sanctions language for asset freezes (e.g. as under the Belarus sanctions ordinance) and thus now expressly requires the freezing of funds and economic resources owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by:\n\nindividuals, entities and organizations listed in Annex 8; individuals, entities and organizations acting on behalf of or on the instructions of the individuals, entities and organizations referred to in subparagraph a.; entities and organizations owned or controlled by individuals, entities and organizations referred to in subparagraphs a. or b.\n\nDeposits and Crypto-Assets\n\nAfter months of back and forth between the EU and Switzerland on whether or not to apply a “look-through” approach under the deposit restrictions in their respective FAQs, the EU had caught Switzerland by surprise when introducing a “look-through” concept in its Regulation. Switzerland now aligned and amended not only Article 20 of the Ordinance but also its FAQ accordingly. Therefore, the deposit restrictions have been extended to banks, companies or organizations established outside Switzerland or the EEA in which more than fifty percent of the shares are held directly or indirectly by Russian nationals or individuals resident in Russia.\n\nThe amendment also removed the exemption to the restrictions for deposits and crypto-assets used for non-prohibited cross-border trade in goods and services between Switzerland, the EEA and Russia. Instead, individual exceptional licenses may be granted by SECO henceforth.\n\nPublic Procurement\n\nLast, but not least, Switzerland implemented the public procurement bans previously introduced by the EU, but delayed for reasons of clearing competences between the Swiss Confederation and its Cantons. According to the new Article 29c of the Ordinance, it is prohibited to award public contracts to (i) Russian nationals or individuals resident in Russia, (ii) legal persons, entities or organizations domiciled in Russia, (iii) legal persons, entities or organizations in which natural or legal persons, entities or organizations under (i) or (ii) hold more than fifty percent, directly or indirectly, or (iv) legal persons, entities or organizations acting on behalf of or on the instructions of natural or legal persons, entities or organizations under (i), (ii) or (iii). The conclusion of procurement contracts with any of the above parties is also prohibited.\n\nAll procurement contracts whose performance has not yet been completed must be terminated by 28 February 2023.\n\nThe prohibition also applies to awards and procurement contracts in which subcontractors or suppliers that qualify as any of the above parties participate with more than ten percent of the tender value. The prohibition does not apply to Russian nationals residing in Switzerland and majority held legal persons, entities or organizations already domiciled in Switzerland. There are also several grounds for exceptional licenses by SECO.\n\nThe latest version of the Ordinance is available here.",
    "Switzerland set to burn more trees to reach its climate and energy goals (commentary)": "Switzerland has pledged to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, with forest-derived biomass slated to play a growing role in the country’s energy mix, following a motion submitted to parliament in 2019 to fully “exploit the potential of energy wood.”\n\nThat decision came despite warnings from the Federal Office for the Environment noting: “strategies that only increase the use of wood as biofuel are not efficient from a CO2 balance perspective.”\n\nWood chips and pellets burned to make energy are one of the few profitable forestry products in an industry that has been losing money since the 1990s to the tune of 40 million francs ($41 million) annually for the past three years alone. Government subsidies also incentivize biomass logging and the downgrading of timber to “waste” wood.\n\nThe autonomy granted to the 26 Swiss cantons means logging rates and practices vary widely across the nation, as do energy policies promoted and adopted. The canton of Bern, where all photos were taken, produces the lion’s share, around one-fifth of all Swiss wood. This post is a commentary. The views expressed are those of the author, not necessarily of Mongabay.\n\nSwitzerland had embarked on an energy transition even before Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, but rocketing energy prices have hastened the need to decrease reliance on imported dirty fossil fuels and strengthen self-sufficiency. Policymakers, backed by a triumvirate of larger environmental NGOs, believe forest-derived biomass should be used to offset fossil fuel use.\n\nWoody biomass in the form of logs, pellets, wood chips and waste wood already accounts for 85% of all Swiss biomass, currently the second-most important renewable in the country after hydro. But an eye-opening report co-authored by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) estimates the additional sustainable energy potential of domestic forest wood to be anywhere from 40% to 89% of today’s use. The reasoning is underpinned by the claims that Swiss forests are growing and that harvesting is “near natural.”\n\nYet logging on the Central Plain, the country’s smallest but most productive forestry region, is already unsustainable, with annual yield (3.283 million cubic meters per year) outstripping growth (2.973 million m3/year). Forests here have shrunk by 3.6% and thinned by 11% in the past 20 years, but the latest 2021 Swiss Statistical Yearbook of Forestry says Switzerland’s overall “wooded area” decreased by some 2,742 hectares (6,776 acres) in 2020 compared to 2019. A further loss of 3,450 hectares (8,525 acres) was recorded by Global Forest Watch in 2021.\n\nThe “Alice in Wonderland Syndrome” is a very real affliction characterized by a distortion of perception: Here are five more impossible things which, like Alice, biomass proponents expect the Swiss public to believe, before breakfast, or after. We need not split hares:\n\nImpossibility #1: Only logging “waste” and timber “residues” are used\n\nPellets and wood chips derive largely from “residues” and “waste” from the timber and logging industries. Or so we are told, but a 2007 report co-authored by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zürich (ETH Zürich) and the federal offices of energy, agriculture and environment concluded such forestry byproducts were already being used for energy production and in the wood industry, thus limiting any market surplus.\n\nThe truth is that whole trees and roundwood are increasingly used. But it is not unusual for half the extracted timber to be considered “waste.” Sometimes virtually all of it is.\n\nImpossibility #2: Biomass is clean\n\nWood smoke is as hazardous to health as tobacco smoke and even so-called eco stoves have been shown to emit 650 times more fine particles, some of them within the home, than a modern HGV truck. Although Swiss laws governing fine particle emissions are more stringent than those of the European Union, they are still twice the World Health Organization’s (WHO) recommended limit of 5 micrograms per cubic meter. Filters are not yet mandatory for 13-to-20-kilowatt (kW) installations found in private Swiss homes.\n\nThe country’s 600,000 wood-burning systems also produce 75,000 metric tons of ash annually, which are dumped in landfills where they can cause structural instability, water table and soil contamination, and bioaccumulation of heavy metal(oid)s in food chains.\n\nLarge waste-burning plants, which are fed with up to one-third wood in addition to household and industrial waste, churn out an additional 4,000 metric tons of highly noxious ash, which is currently exported to neighboring countries because a law enacted to remove heavy metals has been delayed until 2026.\n\nImpossibility #3: Where there’s smoke, there’s no fire … or CO 2\n\nThe SFOE classifies “energy from biomass” as “CO 2 neutral.” Yet the European Academies’ Science Advisory Council (EASAC), which includes Switzerland, deems it “simplistic” to call forest biomass carbon neutral and renewable because most trees regrow too slowly to offset emissions, and anyway forest carbon stocks should be preserved and increased.\n\nMore than 500 international scientists have gone further, warning that the switch from burning fossil fuels to burning wood is a “false solution” that, per unit of heat or electricity produced, adds up to three times more CO 2 to the atmosphere.\n\nImpossibility #4: Robust laws protect Swiss trees and forests\n\nThe Federal Act on Forest (ForA) whose aim is to “conserve the forest in its area and spatial distribution,” has failed the tattered Central Plain forests. Moreover, Switzerland is one of only two European countries to ban clear-cutting under both the ForA and the Ordinance on Forest (ForO), yet “areas cleared of all trees,” or “gaps” as they are called, are multiplying.\n\nConveniently, stands razed of all trees aren’t considered clear-cuts if the trees regrow (Article 20.2 in ForO), as they tend to do in a country with a high rate of natural regeneration. They also still count as forest. So do forestry roads and installations despite being clear cases of deforestation, also prohibited (Article 5.1 in ForA), at least on paper…\n\nLewis Carroll couldn’t have put it better.\n\nImpossibility #5: Money grows on trees\n\nThe high investment and operating costs associated with wood-burning systems needed subsidizing, to the tune of some 9.1 million francs ($9.3 million) in 2019. Such generous financial aid combined with aggressive lobbying have helped boost the numbers of domestic wood burners and larger biomass-fueled district heating and industrial power plants. But up too is the price of energy wood, which increased by 8% from 2016 to 2020, while that of wood pellets has rocketed by 67.7% (from 329 to 551.6 francs, or $336 to $562.6, per metric ton) since last July.\n\nThere are other hidden costs that the Swiss biomass industry remains tight-lipped about, including the fee for ash disposal, which has almost tripled for some power plants in recent years. But it is the tightening of the Ordinance on Air Pollution Control (OAPC) in line with WHO recommendations that could potentially result in even greater costs to consumers and building owners, and which should serve as a warning to potential investors.\n\nThe biomass industry claims it is protecting the planet, not its own interests and profits. This is the deepest rabbit hole of them all.\n\nLet the chips fall\n\nA 2021 study concluded that the best way for Switzerland to become both carbon neutral and energy self-sufficient would be to install combined solar panels and wind turbines high in the Alps, above the winter fog layer. Another option being pursued is heat pumps, which biomass proponents admit “have a much greater potential than energy wood.” Yet those proponents continue to foist their “false solution” on an unsuspecting and well-intentioned public using all the tricks in the Mad Hatter’s hat.\n\nBack in the 1990s, diesel cars were touted as ecological, taxes and incentives were introduced, and sales soared … as did black carbon, nitrogen oxides and particulates. We now know better and diesel vehicles are being phased out, but the same mistake and emissions are being made with woody biomass.\n\nWe must stop wasting time and cut carbon, not forests, which are so much more than just a collection of trees.\n\nBanner image: A mobile chipper making short shrift of freshly felled centenary beech trunks to produce wood chips that are burned “green,” with up to 50% moisture, in a local district heating system in February 2022. Image by Lucie Wuethrich.\n\nLucie Wuethrich began her activism in 2019 when a local beech forest, officially designated as a protection forest to mitigate landslides, was logged and she learned that 95% of the extracted wood was burned as energy wood. Since then she has researched logging and the Swiss forestry industry. She is the sole Swiss-based member of Biofuelwatch and of the Environmental Paper Network’s Biomass Working Group, and has worked closely with environmental NGOs across Europe to raise awareness of the growing pressure on forests.\n\nSee related:\n\nFEEDBACK: Use this form to send a message to the author of this post.

    "Nations League roundup: Northern Ireland win late; Switzerland beat Spain": "Northern Ireland manager, Ian Baraclough, admitted he breathed a huge sigh of relief after Josh Magennis headed in a stoppage-time winner against Kosovo to end their long winless run in the Nations League at Windsor Park.\n\nTen minutes after the substitute Gavin Whyte had given Northern Ireland hope with the equaliser, the Cardiff winger sent in the cross for Magennis to power home a much-needed winner.\n\n“I enjoyed celebrating the goals,” Baraclough said. “I applauded the fans after the game and then went into my office and just sat down and took a big sigh, a big breath.”\n\nAn afternoon that began with Conor McMenamin becoming the second player in as many days to be sent home from the squad, due to a video circulating online, threatened to get much worse after Vedat Muriqi’s 58th-minute strike had fans once again calling for the manager’s head.\n\nBut instead Northern Ireland claimed three points in this competition for the first time in 15 attempts, moving clear of the immediate threat of relegation to the bottom tier. In the other match in Group C2 Cyprus shocked leaders Greece 1-0 in Larnaca thanks to a first-half goal from Marinos Tzionis.\n\nIn Group A2 Manchester City’s Manuel Akanji and Breel Embolo scored Switzerland’s goals as they beat Spain, for whom Jordi Alba equalised on 55 minutes, 2-1 in Zaragoza. In Prague Manchester United and Liverpool players provided all of Portugal’s goals in their 4-0 thrashing of Czech Republic. Bruno Fernandes’s goal was bookended by two from Diogo Dalot’s, and Diogo Jota completed the scoring from a Cristiano Ronaldo assist on 82 minutes. Portugal lead the group on 10 points, with Spain two points behind them ahead of their decisive meeting in Braga on Tuesday.\n\nAleksandar Mitrovic watches his header beat Sweden’s goalkeeper Robin Olsen to score the first of his three goals in a 4-1 win. Photograph: Darko Vojinović/AP\n\nIn Scotland’s group Ukraine ran riot in Yerevan, beating Armenia 5-0, with Artem Dovbyk getting a second-half double. The result means Scotland need to avoid defeat to Ukraine in Kraków on Tuesday to win Group B1.\n\nA hat-trick from Aleksandar Mitrovic set Serbia on course for an easy 4-1 win over Sweden in Group B4 to set up a winner-takes-all clash in their final game against Norway in Oslo on Tuesday. Sweden took the lead against the run of play through Viktor Claesson in the 15th minute but they had no answer to the physicality of Serbia’s record goalscorer Mitrovic, who headed his side level three minutes later. The 28-year-old put them ahead just before the break when he headed home from a corner and he completed his hat-trick three minutes after half-time with a simple finish from Dusan Vlahovic’s incisive pass. Sasa Lukic netted the fourth goal.\n\nNorway went down 2-1 at home to Slovenia despite taking the lead through Erling Haaland. Norway are tied with Serbia on ten points but remain top of the group thanks to their 1-0 win in Belgrade earlier in the campaign.",

The protest was held alongside the ongoing 51st session of the UN Human Rights Council.\n\nMembers of the Community, holding the Tibetan National flags and placards, raised slogans demanding the United Nations to pay attention to Tibet’s deteriorating human rights situation. The demonstrators also shouted slogans calling China to“End Torture” “End Genocide” and “Release all Political Prisoners” in Tibet. The Community also submitted an appeal letter calling the newly appointed High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk to heed the voices of Tibetan people.\n\nWhile addressing the gathering, Representative Thinlay Chukki acknowledged and thanked the community members for shouldering the responsibility in speaking-up for Tibetans who are suppressed and silenced by the Chinese Communist Party. She appealed to the community members to nurture the upcoming Tibetan generation in a way that would encourage and enable every single Tibetans to contribute and take active role in advancing the just cause of Tibet. Referring to the former High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet’s silence on Tibet, Representative Thinlay said “the silence has been interpreted as not taking the overall responsibility” to protect the human rights across the world, in particular for Tibet.\n\nThe gathering was also addressed by Vice-President of Swiss-Tibetan Women Organisation Passang Dolma; President of Tibetan Youth Association Europe Dalha Kangsar and Representatives from Swiss-Tibetan Friendship Association Tenzin Wangmo and Uwe Meya.\n\nThe President of the Central Tibetan Youth Congress Gonpo Dhundup, President of Central Tibetan Women Association Tenzing Dolma and Senior Researcher from Tibet Watch Wangden Kyab took part in the demonstration as well.\n\nThe President of the Tibetan Community Karma Choekyi and UN Advocacy Officer of the Tibet Bureau Kalden Tsomo submitted an appeal letter to the Office of High Commissioner for Human Rights addressed to the newly appointed High Commissioner Volker Türk.

    "7 Things I Wish I Knew Before Visiting The Swiss Alps": "The beauty of the high peaks of the Swiss and Bernese Alps is undeniable, but the weather and altitude sickness can take away from the beauty.\n\nAt Jungfraujoch – Top of Europe, a blizzard raged and the wind was so bitingly cold that my poor gloveless hands were turning into ice. I had packed a thick jacket for this trip to the Jungfrau region of Switzerland, but I didn’t pack anything else suited for winter, like a hat or gloves.\n\nIt was summer after all.\n\nI was on a hosted adventure to experience summer in the Swiss Alps near the town of Grindelwald in central Switzerland, so I didn’t think I would need anything beyond a coat for the cold nights.\n\nYet, even as the sun shone warmly in the valley, I was shivering and freezing in the summer, but winter, storm that raged on top of Jungfrau, one of two major 4,000-footers of the Bernese Alp. The furious snow blocked out most of the Aletsch Glacier view at 11,332 feet above sea level.\n\nNot being prepared for a variety of weather conditions was one of a few mistakes I made when I visited the Jungfrau region for the first time. I am usually adept at researching places before I visit, but I still missed out on some tips that would have made my life a little easier while visiting Switzerland.\n\nHere are 7 things I wish I knew before visiting the Swiss Alps.\n\nThe weather in Switzerland can be flighty, so pack layers and all-season gear. Photo credit: Heide Brandes\n\n1. Bring Layers\n\nThe weather in the bucolic valleys of Switzerland vary dramatically from the weather at the top of the mountains and peaks in this region. Because the Swiss Alps straddle the northern European climate and the warmer southern European climate, the weather can be both cool and warm at the same time. In fact, you could experience sunshine in one valley while rain pours down on the other side of the mountain.\n\nWhen in doubt, it’s better to have that extra jacket and pair of gloves and not need it, rather than to need it and not have it. Bringing heavy winter gear along with shorts and tank tops may mean extra luggage, but don’t underestimate how diverse the weather in Switzerland can be at any time of the year.\n\nPro Tip: For every 328-foot gain in elevation, the temperature can drop approximately 1.8 degrees. So, if you get on top of the Jungfraujoch, for instance, you’re at 2.14 miles above sea level where the mountain tops are chilly in summer and sometimes covered in thick layers of snow.\n\nSwitzerland sits at one of the highest elevations in the world, so altitude sickness could become a problem if you aren’t prepared. Photo credit: Heide Brandes\n\n2. Be Prepared For Altitude Sickness\n\nElevation, again, can cause a bit of misery for visitors to Switzerland if they aren’t prepared for the altitude. Switzerland lies at an average elevation of 4,429 feet above sea level, making it one of the highest countries in the world. Switzerland’s highest mountain peak — Dufourspitze — is 15,203 feet.\n\nIf you’re not used to high elevations, then altitude sickness can be pretty miserable. According to a study titled “Prevalence of acute mountain sickness in the Swiss Alps,” acute mountain sickness is “not an uncommon disease at moderately high altitude.” It can cause “severe headache, vomiting, dizziness, tachypnoea, and pronounced pulmonary rales.”\n\nOne of the ways to combat this sickness is to ask your physician for a prescription called Acetazolamide, or Diamox. This is the common prescription for preventing acute mountain sickness, high altitude pulmonary edema, and high altitude cerebral edema.\n\nYou can also get over-the-counter medications to combat altitude sickness, but in my personal experience, they don’t work as well.\n\nPro Tip: If you are at high altitudes, treat all headaches, dizziness, or vomiting as altitude sickness. Immediately descend to a lower altitude and make sure you are always properly hydrated. If you do plan to climb or summit these high peaks, spend a day or two in one of the nearby towns to slowly acclimate.\n\nThe Swiss love rich food, and you will too. Just be prepared with stomach medications to combat all that over indulgence. Photo credit: Heide Brandes\n\n3. Tummy Issues Are Common\n\nOne of the best things about Switzerland is the food and drink. The Swiss are masters in the arts of chocolate, cheese making, and wine, so be prepared to be tempted by plenty of delicious, rich, and dairy-heavy foods.\n\nWhile traveling in planes, trains, and automobiles generally causes me to “slow down” in the digestive process — if you know what I mean — the rich and tempting foods made me even more constipated than usual. Other people may have the opposite problem, depending on their body types.\n\nSo, if you plan to indulge in all the rich cheese dishes and fondues, the mouthwatering chocolate and hearty sausages, be sure to pack your over-the-counter tummy medications for either issue.\n\n4. Switzerland Is Expensive\n\nYou might have heard already that Switzerland is expensive. In fact, Zurich and Geneva are often included in lists touting the most expensive cities in the world.\n\nYes, certain things are much more expensive in Switzerland, like groceries, clothing, shoe shopping, and going out to dinner or for drinks. In fact, unless you eat fast food, finding a meal for less than 20 CHF ($20.51) is difficult.\n\nPublic transportation, tourism excursions, and medical costs are also much higher in cost than other destinations.\n\nThat being said, if you have the ability to stock up on light groceries to cover breakfast and lunch, you’ll be able to indulge in the cost-worthy food that restaurants serve here. Just, be aware of the expenses you may face and budget accordingly.\n\nIf you’re traveling a lot in Switzerland, a Swiss Travel Pass will save you a ton of money. Photo credit: Heide Brandes\n\n5. Invest In A Rail Pass\n\nSwitzerland is home to some of the best public transit in the world, and if you want to see all that this beautiful country has to offer, traveling by train, gondola, and funicular is the way to go. As stated above, Switzerland can be a bit expensive, so buying individual train and gondola tickets can really add up after a while and a rail pass can save you a ton of money.\n\nThe Swiss Travel Rail pass from Rail Europe gives you access to the panoramic trains like the Glacier Express, Bernina Express, Luzern–Interlaken Express, GoldenPass Panoramic as well as the Gotthard Panorama Express. Although this is a much better option than buying individual tickets, you can expect to pay a lot for the Swiss Travel Pass, so be prepared for sticker shock.\n\nThs rail pass also has public transport in more than 90 Swiss towns and cities. It even offers senior passes. The Swiss Travel Pass is sold for 3, 4, 8, and 15 days and allows free entrance to over 480 museums and exhibitions.\n\n6. Buy Your Alcohol In The Stores\n\nLike many other things in Switzerland, going out to drink and buying wine at restaurants is a pricey affair. Skip drinking at the bars and restaurants and just buy your wine and beer at the grocery store to drink at your hotel or rental.\n\nKeep in mind that alcohol hits the body a lot faster and harder in higher elevation, making you a cheap drunk in the mountains.\n\n7. Get A Universal Adapter\n\nIf you are traveling around Europe and Switzerland, get the right adapter to charge your electronics. While most of Europe uses the Schuko plug (type F), Switzerland is different and uses type J outlets, which are smaller.\n\nInstead of buying both, you can buy a universal travel adaptor. Just make sure it has a type J outlet included.\n\nCheck out our most recent Swiss Alps coverage, including:",

Keystone / Jean-christophe Bott\n\nSwitzerland has returned as a popular destination for foreigners looking for work after two years of Covid-19 restrictions. Over 75,000 people have immigrated to Switzerland so far in 2022, driven largely by an economic boom and unemployment levels falling to a 20-year low.\n\nThis content was published on September 8, 2022 - 11:09\n\nAlexander Thoele\n\nAlexander Thoele began working for SWI swissinfo.ch in 2002.

According to the latest figuresExternal link from the State Secretariat for Migration (SEM), 75,098 people arrived in Switzerland in the first half of 2022 – a 21% increase on the same period in 2021.\n\nThe net migration rate during this period – the difference between the number of immigrants and number of emigrants – was 37,816. And the major driver was work: almost 42,000 people came to Switzerland for a job during the period, even more than in pre-pandemic times.\n\nExternal Content\n\nMeanwhile, according to the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO), unemployment rates reached a 20-year low of 2% in June 2022, while the number of jobs on offer in the first quarter of the year was the highest since records began in 2003.\n\nGermany, Italy, France\n\nThe majority of new arrivals to Switzerland came from neighbouring countries, notably Germany (20%), Italy (16%) and France (15%). Portugal (9%), Spain (7%) and Romania (6%) were also significant sources. In total, the number of workers from European Union (EU) and European Free Trade Area (EFTA) countries increased by 11,526 on the same period in 2021.\n\nCross-border workers – who receive a permitExternal link to work in Switzerland while continuing to live in a neighbouring country – also rose by 6%, from 408,447 in July 2021 to 433,379 in July this year. And people working on short-term permitsExternal link (usually for less than a year) rose from 116,924 to 155,329.\n\nMeanwhile, figures recently published by the Federal Statistical Office (FSO) showed that the overall population in Switzerland had risen by 0.8% to 8,738,800 people by the end of 2021 – of these, 25.7% did not have Swiss nationality.\n\nExternal Content\n\nImmigrants are happy in Switzerland\n\nIn order to better understand the situation of migrants, the “NCCR – on the move” research project run by the University of Geneva has been periodically conducting surveys since 2014. For its third edition, published in July 2021, it received feedback from 7,393 foreigners on their migrant experience, their work, social and family situation, and their connection to their homeland.\n\nThe results give a picture of how these immigrants perceive life in Switzerland as well as – with the questionnaire sent out in 2020 – an idea of how they adapted to the restrictions around the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe results were largely positive: despite the difficult economic situation at the time, just 5% of respondents said they had lost their job due to the pandemic. Rather, a large majority (77%) said Switzerland was the “right place” to be during such an unstable period. Over 80% said their professional situation had improved relative to before they came to Switzerland.\n\nHighly qualified\n\n“Switzerland is one of the most attractive countries in Europe for migrants looking for work,” says Philippe Wanner, research coordinator and a professor at the Institute for Demographics and Socio-Economics at the University of Geneva. He says the immigrants surveyed were “successful in a [Swiss] job market which is competitive, but which offers salaries higher than the European average”.\n\nThere have however been changes in the profiles of immigrants. Compared to the first survey done by the project in 2014, immigrants with a higher-level qualification have risen from 51.2% to just under 60% of the total. In the past, “migrants from Germany, France, and Italy, in particular, had more basic qualifications,” says Wanner.\n\nAs such, there is a downward trend in the number of migrant workers with intermediate levels of education. Wanner says “the Swiss job market doesn’t have a high need for this type of workforce, since the professional training system here already functions very well”.\n\nThe next edition of the “NCCR – on the move” survey, financed by the Swiss National Science Foundation, will be published in spring 2023.\n\nAdapted by Domhnall O'Sullivan.\n\nIn compliance with the JTI standards\n\nMore: SWI swissinfo.ch certified by the Journalism Trust Initiative",

    "Switzerland braces for winter energy crunch": "Lowering the temperature in buildings by one degree Celsius would reduce gas consumption by 5-6%. Keystone / Hauke-christian Dittrich\n\nDespite being one of the world’s richest countries, Switzerland also faces the threat of an energy shortage in the coming months. The authorities are scrambling to prepare.\n\nThis content was published on September 14, 2022 - 11:00\n\nLuigi Jorio\n\nA journalist from Ticino resident in Bern, I write on scientific and social issues with reports, articles, interviews and analysis. I am interested in environmental, climate change and energy issues, as well as migration, development aid and human rights in general.\n\nSWI swissinfo.ch has gathered answers to some of the most pressing questions on electricity supply, Switzerland’s dependence on Russian gas, and measures being taken to get the country through the winter.\n\nIs Switzerland self-sufficient in meeting its energy needs?\n\nNo. Domestic electricity production covers only around 25% of the country’s energy needs. The remaining 75% is imported in the form of crude oil, petroleum products, gas and coal.\n\nCompared with other European countries, Switzerland is one of the least self-sufficient in terms of energy production.\n\nExternal Content\n\nWhere does the electricity used in Switzerland come from?\n\nThe country’s 682 hydroelectric power plants provide more than half of the electricity produced in Switzerland (61.5% in 2021). The rest comes from the country’s four nuclear power plants (28.9%), conventional thermal power plants (3.6%), and renewable sources such as solar energy and wind power (6%).\n\nDuring the summer months, Switzerland produces more electricity than it consumes. In winter, there is a drop in hydroelectric production, so electricity has to be imported from neighbouring countries, mainly France and Germany.\n\nHow important is Russian gas for Switzerland?\n\nSwitzerland does not have exploitable gas deposits of its own, and therefore depends entirely on imports. Gas accounts for around 15% of Swiss energy consumption (compared to 22% in the European Union), and about half of this comes from Russia. In Switzerland, natural gas is mainly used for heat production. Around one in five households heat their homes with gas in winter.\n\nExternal Content\n\nWhat is the risk of an energy shortage this winter?\n\nThe threat of an electricity shortage in winter is not new. As Switzerland is not part of the EU and has so far failed to conclude a frameworkExternal link agreement on bilateral relations with Brussels, there had already been fears that the EU could shut off the electricity tap in case of a shortfall.\n\nThis year, however, the threat of a shortage is exacerbated by the general hike in energy prices, the forced shutdown of around half of France’s nuclear reactors (which supply electricity to Switzerland in the winter) and the prolonged drought. Low river levels, a lack of snowfall in the mountains, and scarce rain have brought water reserves in many hydroelectric basins to an all-time low.\n\nThe cutback in Russian gas supplies to Europe could also have an indirect impact on electricity in Switzerland. Countries such as Germany could well curb exports of electricity produced by their gas-fired power plants as a result.\n\nWith regard to gas, the possible shortage is directly linked to the war in Ukraine. Switzerland has no gas storage facilities of its own and, as mentioned above, depends entirely on imports. A shortfall in Europe would thus also be felt in Switzerland.\n\nWhat measures are Swiss authorities taking to avert an energy shortage?\n\nThe federal government has introduced a gas storage plan in neighbouring countries as well as a voluntary gas savings programmeExternal link aimed at reducing demand among households and businesses by 15% this winter. The authorities’ reliance on the population’s help to reduce consumption and save energy goes further. Late last month it launched a public information campaign, “Energy is scarce – let’s not waste it”, that encourages consumers to turn down their heating, use less hot water, and switch off unused electrical devices and lights.\n\nIn the event of a severe gas shortage, the government said it was prepared to take more drastic measures, such as limiting heating in homes to 19°C and banning gas heating in second holiday homes and swimming pools.\n\nMany cantons have also set up energy taskforces and crisis management teams. Some cities have already announced plans to turn down heating and save electricity in public buildings, such as by reducing decorative Christmas lights.\n\nHow are other countries getting ready?\n\nSome European countries have already announced restrictions and bans in order to cut back their gas and electricity consumption. Germany thus plans to outlaw floodlighting of buildings and historical monuments, limit heating in non-residential public buildings to 19°C, and forbid the heating of swimming pools.\n\nIn Spain, shop lights now have to be switched off at night, while France is set to ban illuminated advertising and is also preparing to ration electricity for businesses. No final decisions have been taken yet in Italy (the new government will do so after the elections on September 25), but heating restrictions, a reduction in street lighting at night, and the early closure of shops cannot be ruled out.\n\nAdapted from Italian by Julia Bassam/gw\n\nIn compliance with the JTI standards\n\nMore: SWI swissinfo.ch certified by the Journalism Trust Initiative",

    "Spotlight: wealth structuring and regulation in Switzerland": "All questions\n\nWealth structuring and regulation\n\ni Commonly used vehicles for wealth structuring\n\nInternational trusts, family foundations, life insurance wrappers, lifetime gifts and personal holding structures are the most commonly used tools for wealth and estate planning purposes.\n\nIn particular, foundations (Swiss or foreign, charitable or not) are commonly used planning vehicles. Foreign law trusts are also used for Swiss residents (in specific cases) or more commonly for non-residents with assets located in Switzerland.\n\nTrusts\n\nTo date, there is no Swiss domestic trust law.\n\nTrusts are, however, recognised as Switzerland is a contracting state party to the Hague Convention of 1 July 1985 on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition (Hague Trust Convention), which became applicable in Switzerland on 1 July 2007. The Hague Trust Convention:\n\ndesignates the law applicable to a trust; requires contracting state parties to recognise the effects of trusts validly settled provided that the trust meets the minimum standards prescribed by the Hague Trust Convention; and accepts that certain effects of a trust may conflict with applicable mandatory provisions protecting creditors, spouse, heirs, bona fide third parties, etc., under Swiss law.\n\nThe Swiss Parliament is currently reviewing the possible introduction of a Swiss trust law. The Federal Council initiated, in January 2022, a public consultation on a draft Bill aimed at introducing trusts into Swiss law. Trusts will be a specific legal instrument, which will be included in a new chapter of the Swiss Code of Obligations, that can be used, among other vehicles, to structure private assets. It remains to be seen whether the attempt to introduce trusts into Swiss law will succeed this time.\n\nNote also that Switzerland is a contracting state party to the 2007 Lugano Convention on the Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters, which sets out rules of jurisdiction in proceedings against Swiss domiciled trustees. The Hague Trust Convention sets out the jurisdiction of Swiss courts in matters falling outside the 2007 Lugano Convention.\n\nA Swiss private trust company (PTC) as trustee of a foreign law trust can be used for planning purposes. The advantages of Swiss PTCs include the following:\n\nSwiss PTCs are deployed in cases in which clients prefer to be associated with onshore centres; as many clients often have assets in Switzerland, dealing with a Swiss-based trustee can simplify administration and reduce time-related costs; Switzerland is a centre for financial and investment opportunities. Dealing with a Swiss company can therefore simplify due diligence processes; and Switzerland has a strong tradition of excelling in providing a wide range of services to wealthy families from around the world in association with a high level of confidentiality (e.g., the ownership of the PTC would not be publicly available).\n\nFrom 1 January 2020, the Swiss Financial Institutions Act (FinIA) and the Swiss Financial Services Act introduced a regulatory regime for trustees operating in Switzerland, obliging trustees to obtain an authorisation to carry out their activities. There are exemptions, such as certain PTCs.\n\nFamily foundations\n\nSwiss law provides for specific legal provisions regarding foundations, including private foundations known as family foundations. A family foundation is characterised as a foundation established for the benefit of beneficiaries who are members of the founder's family. According to Article 335 of the Swiss Civil Code, as considered by the Swiss Supreme Court, there is an exhaustive list of purposes for which a family foundation may be set up: education, welfare and health. Foundations granting a beneficial interest – for example, to allow a beneficiary a higher standard of living – are considered null and void.\n\nSwiss foundations are commonly used for charitable purposes (see below).\n\nPrivate foundations governed by the laws of another jurisdiction are frequently used in Switzerland and recognised provided that they satisfy the publicity or registration provisions of the law of establishment or, in the absence thereof, that they have been established in accordance with the laws of that state, regardless of the fact that they might support, even entirely, the living costs of their beneficiaries.\n\nSwiss charitable foundations\n\nIn Switzerland, foundations are commonly used for wealth charitable planning.13 Their supervision by the competent regulatory and tax authorities, linked to the fact that their purposes can only be modified under strict conditions, make it a tool particularly appreciated by individuals willing to engage, both in Switzerland and abroad, in charitable activities.\n\nUnder certain conditions, Swiss charitable foundations can also be fully tax exempted.\n\nii Legal and tax treatments of commonly used vehicles\n\nMainly due to tax reasons, special vehicles such as trusts and foundations are not widely used by Swiss tax residents for wealth planning purposes. Private holding companies offer the possibility to structure one's wealth effectively. However, they often pose problems as to where their effective place of management is located, that is, at the seat of the company or at the domicile of the shareholder, especially if the company is domiciled offshore or even in another canton within Switzerland. In some cases, the company may be disregarded altogether. In the case of substantial investments in real estate or in an enterprise, an indirect investment through a corporation may be beneficial. Individuals moving to Switzerland, on the other hand, may already use a trust or foundation to protect and manage their assets.\n\nTrusts\n\nThe tax treatment of trusts is based on a circular letter published in 2008 by the Swiss tax conference, a body consisting of the heads of the cantonal tax authorities.\n\nBased on the circular letter, the trust itself is not taxable in Switzerland. The taxation of the beneficiaries and settlors of trusts depends on how a trust is organised. Swiss tax law distinguishes between revocable (transparent) and irrevocable trusts. If the trust qualifies as a revocable trust, its assets and income derived thereon are attributed to the settlor for tax purposes. Neither the trust deed nor the letter of wishes alone are decisive for the qualification of a trust. The qualification for tax purposes is always based on the entire facts and circumstances. The key criterion is whether the settlor has irrevocably given up his or her rights over the trust assets.\n\nThe trust is disregarded for Swiss tax purposes as long as the settlor has control over the trust assets (e.g., if he or she is in a position to control the trustees, or if he or she can instruct and replace them; or if he or she remains a beneficiary). In such case, the trust assets as well as any income thereon is taxable to the settlor. Consequently, distributions from a revocable trust to the settlor are regarded as asset restructuring and, hence, are not taxable. Further, distributions from a revocable trust to a beneficiary are regarded as a donation from the settlor to the beneficiary and as such are subject to gift tax depending on the degree of kinship between the settlor and the beneficiary. Generally, a trust established by a Swiss resident settlor qualifies as a revocable trust for Swiss tax purposes.\n\nSwiss tax law further distinguishes between irrevocable and fully discretionary and fixed interest trusts. Distributions from an irrevocable and fully discretionary trust are generally subject to income tax at the level of the beneficiary. The beneficiaries of a fixed interest trust are taxed in proportion to their share on the trust assets and the respective income.\n\nThe qualification of trusts for Swiss tax purposes may not necessarily correspond with the qualification of the trust in the jurisdiction where it has been established. Therefore, and before taking up residency in Switzerland, it is advisable to discuss the tax treatment of the trust and future distributions with the tax authorities and to confirm the outcome in a binding tax ruling. There are cantonal differences in the interpretation of the above-mentioned circular letter.\n\nThe draft Bill currently under discussion within the Parliament also introduces detailed provisions on the taxation of trusts. The distinction between revocable and irrevocable trusts will remain. However, new rules are introduced for irrevocable discretionary trusts: (1) upon the creation of such a Swiss trust, cantonal inheritance or gift tax will be due; (2) if a beneficiary is a Swiss resident or if the settlor was a Swiss resident at the time the trust was created, the trust will be subject to corporate income tax; and (3) income tax will be levied upon distribution to Swiss resident beneficiaries. These rules would apply to Swiss and foreign trusts with a Swiss nexus.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether this heavy taxation will be maintained in the final draft Bill at the risk of derailing the introduction of Swiss trusts.\n\nFoundations\n\nAs described above, Swiss foundations are separate legal entities and, hence, are tax subjects in Switzerland. In principle, distributions are taxed as income at the level of the beneficiary. This makes Swiss foundations less interesting for estate planning purposes because lineal descendants and spouses are exempt from inheritance tax.\n\nHowever, Switzerland is home to many charitable foundations. If a foundation pursues a charitable purpose, it may be fully exempt from taxes. Pursuant to Swiss tax law, a charitable purpose is defined as being directed towards the benefit of the public or the welfare of third parties such as charity, humanitarian, cultural or environmental or religious goals. The activity must meet the needs of a large part of the Swiss population and may not be limited to a specific group of persons defined by kinship, profession or similar, hence excluding self-help foundations. The foundation must not be profit-seeking and the members of the foundation board may not be salaried for their engagement. If these conditions are met, the foundation may be granted a tax exemptions. As a result, donations can be deducted from income taxes and distributions are not taxable to the beneficiary.\n\nIn accordance with the incorporation theory prevailing in Switzerland, a foreign foundation is recognised as a legal entity in Switzerland. A recognition is only refused if the foundation is obviously used to evade taxes or any other grounds for a pass-through (e.g., if the founder has not irrevocably ceased control over the assets of the foundation). In this case, its assets may be attributed to the founder for income and wealth tax purposes. If, however, the foundation is effectively managed and controlled in Switzerland, it may become liable to Swiss taxes. The taxation of distributions from a foreign foundation is based on the same criteria as those for the distributions from a trust.\n\niii Anti-money laundering and other key regulations\n\nThe Anti-Money Laundering Act (AMLA) and the provision sanctioning money laundering in the Criminal Code (Article 305 bis) are the cornerstones of the anti-money laundering regime in Switzerland. The AMLA applies to all financial intermediaries, which notably includes asset managers and trustees that are subject to the Financial Institutions Act (FinIA) (see below). Subjection to the AMLA triggers the duty to identify the contracting party and the beneficial owner of the assets remitted (and to renew such identification process in the case of doubts about their identity). In addition, financial intermediaries have a duty to clarify the economic background and the purpose of a transaction or of a business relationship if the transaction or the business relationship appears unusual, unless its legality is clear, or if it carries a higher risk (which is always deemed to be the case for business relationships with politically exposed persons and their family members). Financial intermediaries must furthermore keep records of transactions carried out and of clarifications required under the AMLA. They also have a duty to file a report with the Money Laundering Reporting Office Switzerland in the event of a suspicion of money laundering.\n\nA revision of the AMLA was finalised by the Swiss Parliament in March 2021. The revised AMLA should come into force on 1 October 2022. The parliament finally decided not to include new obligations for lawyers and fiduciaries who provide services to (domiciliary) companies or trusts, although this is a long-standing recommendation of the Financial Action Task Force. Critics say that the revised AMLA is actually only a transposition in the legislation of standards that are already applied by financial intermediaries in practice with the sole proper improvement being that associations that collect or distribute funds abroad for charitable, religious, cultural or social purposes will be required to be more transparent.\n\nA major change in the landscape of regulation of financial service providers in Switzerland occurred in 2020. Indeed, since 1 January 2020, asset managers, trustees, collective asset managers, fund management companies and securities firms are subject to the FinIA and its Ordinance, FinIO. Persons who manage solely the assets of persons with whom they have business or family ties are not subject to the FinIA. This legislation sets new standards and requires the persons and entities to whom it applies to obtain an authorisation from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) to operate. One of the requirements to obtain the authorisation is an affiliation with one of the supervisory organisations (SOs), which are non-governmental agencies licensed and supervised by FINMA. From a timing perspective, financial institutions that started their commercial activity before 1 January 2020 must apply for a licence from FINMA by the end of 2022. Those who started a commercial activity as a trustee in 2020 had to be affiliated to a SO by 6 July 2021 and submit a licence application to FINMA.",

    "Switzerland finds holes in Spain defence in Nations League upset": "Switzerland’s defender Manuel Akanji (centre) scores against Spain’s goalkeeper Unai Simon during their UEFA Nations League match in Zaragoza on Saturday (AFP photo by Javier Soriano)\n\nZARAGOZA, Spain — Switzerland earned a 2-1 win over Spain in the Nations League on Saturday in Zaragoza to drag Luis Enrique’s side off top spot in the group.\n\nPortugal thrashed the Czech Republic 4-0 in the other League A Group 2 clash to move two points clear of Spain, whom they host on Tuesday in the final group match.\n\nIt was Spain’s first defeat in the group in five games, and one which exposed their defensive frailty from set-pieces.\n\nManuel Akanji and Breel Embolo both scored from Switzerland corners, either side of Jordi Alba’s strike.\n\n“In two set-piece situations, which will be important at the World Cup, their goals arrived,” said Villarreal defender Pau Torres.\n\n“We have to improve on that.”\n\nSpain never looked comfortable in the game, a far cry from the team which reached the Euro 2020 semifinals and were defeated on penalties by Italy.\n\nAs a result, they stumbled to their first loss on home soil since 2018, after 22 matches unbeaten.\n\nLuis Enrique selected six Barcelona players in his starting line-up, including the regular midfield trio Xavi Hernandez utilises at Camp Nou, in Pedri, Gavi and Sergio Busquets.\n\nFerran Torres was another of the Barca clan, part of a three-pronged attack alongside Real Madrid’s Marco Asensio and Paris Saint-Germain’s Pablo Sarabia.\n\nNone of the three have enjoyed regular football with their clubs this season but were given Luis Enrique’s trust.\n\nThey did not repay it in the first half, with Spain anaemic in attack and asleep at the back when it mattered most.\n\n“We were sluggish, no, worse than sluggish,” said Luis Enrique.\n\n“We had the most imprecise first half of my reign as coach.\n\n“[However] this defeat does not condition anything ahead of the World Cup, at all. It’s always good to arrive in form to a World Cup, but I have total faith in the team.”\n\nSet piece woes\n\nSwitzerland took the lead when Manchester City summer signing Akanji got the better of Cesar Azpilicueta in the air at a corner and nodded past Unai Simon in the 21st minute.\n\nSpain struggled to create at the other end and Switzerland almost doubled their lead when veteran midfielder Xherdan Shaqiri cut through the defence and forced Simon into a smart save shortly before the interval.\n\nThe crowd grumbled, unimpressed at a drenched La Romareda Stadium, in a city where Spain had not played since 2003.\n\nAsensio had them out of their seats early in the second half when he created the Spain equaliser with an electric burst forward, before playing in Alba to finish clinically.\n\nHowever, three minutes later Spain defended another corner poorly and Akanji’s flick-on was nudged over the line by Embolo to restore the Swiss lead.\n\nDefending set-plays was a serious issue for La Roja at Euro 2020 and it clearly remains one as the World Cup approaches.\n\nLuis Enrique replaced his entire forward line, with debutant Borja Iglesias drawing huge applause at his former hunting ground, while Nico Williams also earned his first cap, a day after his older brother Inaki Williams made his debut for Ghana.\n\nAthletic Bilbao forward Williams almost forced the equaliser when his cross was turned towards his own goal by Silvan Widmer, but Yann Sommer reacted quickly to keep the ball out.\n\nThe goalkeeper produced another solid save, punching away substitute Marcos Llorente’s fierce drive as Spain began to threaten more.\n\nVillarreal winger Yeremy Pino was bright on the right flank but even his spark fizzled out in the rain, and Sommer stayed alert until the end to deny Carlos Soler.\n\nLuis Enrique’s side, the 2021 Nations League runners-up, must now overcome Portugal in Braga to reach next year’s finals.\n\n“We have to beat Portugal now and make it to the final four,” said Spain’s goalscorer Alba, who has dropped behind Alejandro Balde and Marcos Alonso in the pecking order at Barcelona.\n\n“I am grateful to the coach for keeping his confidence in me, and I just have to show that on the pitch.”"
