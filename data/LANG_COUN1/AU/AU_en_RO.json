    "Health minister: 3 mln expired COVID vaccine doses destroyed in Romania so far": "Romania has so far destroyed about 3 million expired COVID-19 vaccine doses, health minister Alexandru Rafila said. Another 3 million doses will most likely have the same fate, as they will expire by the end of the year.\n\nAsked how much money Romania put into the vaccines it did not use, Rafila spoke of EUR 100-200 million.\n\n\"Of course, it's complicated to calculate because you also have to add the doses that are still in stock and that we haven't used and are unlikely to use. I think we have about 7-8 million in stock at the moment, and with the others I told you about, we will probably reach a consistent figure. If we're talking about 15 million vaccine doses, it's probably EUR 100-200 million, I can't tell you exactly,\" Rafila told local news channel Antena 3, News.ro reported.\n\nMinister Rafila also said that, under the contract, Romania is still to receive millions of COVID-19 vaccine doses.\n\n\"It's a delicate situation, I personally tried to find a solution. Beyond appetite, there are some contractual obligations. This year we are going to receive about 11.2 million doses of vaccine, and next year about 19 million doses of vaccine. This is the contractual provision. […] I had discussions with the Commission and the producers. I hope, and we are on the verge of obtaining a reduction of about 80% of this year's contract, and the vaccine that should come to Romania should be with the new formula,\" Alexandru Rafila said.\n\nAbout a month ago, the health minister said Romania has 8 million COVID-19 vaccine doses that it might have to destroy once they expire as neither the population nor other countries are interested in them.\n\nirina.marica@romania-insider.com\n\n(Photo source: Facebook/Ministerul Sanatatii)",
    "Electricity subsidies cleared by Romania's market regulator reached RON 4.3 bln": "The value of the subsidy disbursement request filed by the electricity supply companies and approved by Romania's market regulator ANRE reached RON 4.3 bln (EUR 860 mln), according to the market regulator quoted by Economica.net.\n\nUnder the first \"cap-and-subsidy\" scheme (OUG 118/2021), for the period April 2022 - March 2023, a number of 80 companies submitted subsidy settlement requests.\n\nThe total number of requests submitted is 347, out of which 277 were approved and 56 were rejected.

    "Romania's Hidroelectrica wants to take over supply firm previously owned by CEZ": "The Board of Romanian state-controlled hydropower company Hidroelectrica green-lighted the bid for electricity supply firm CEZ Vanzare, taken over by the Australian investment fund Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets (MIRA) from Czech group CEZ at the end of 2020, E-nergia.ro announced quoting a company's press release.\n\nThe target company was evaluated by MIRA, at the time it took it over, at EUR 15 mln.\n\nE-nergia.ro reported this spring that the Australian investment fund plans to divest the supply firm and keep the other assets taken over from CEZ.\n\nAt this moment, the Romanian electricity suppliers accuse challenging cash flow problems caused by the Government not paying timely the subsidies.\n\nThe biggest impact on Hidroelectrica's business derives not from the price paid for CEZ Vanzare (supposedly low, considering the market circumstances) but from the subsequent enlargement of its customer base: CEZ Vanzare serves some 75,000 non-residential customers and 1.3 mln residential customers. For comparison, Hidroelectrica serves 21,000 large customers (residential and non-residential) and 0.3 mln residential customers.\n\nThe takeover would make the hydropower group (with a market share of some 30% in normal years) one of the major electricity suppliers as well. At this moment, Hidroelectrica sells electricity to households at the lowest price on the market: just below the cap set by the Government (above which the state provided subsidies to the supply companies).\n\nMIRA took over CEZ Vânzare and all other assets, including a distribution network in the southern part of the country, a wind farm in Dobrogea and micro hydro plants in Caraşi county, from CEZ in a transaction worth RON 4.7 bln (EUR 1 bln).\n\niulian@romania-insider.com\n\n(Photo source: Dreamstime.com)",
    "CNN partner Antena 3 to relaunch in Romania": "The Romanian 24-hour news channel Antena 3 will relaunch this Tuesday (September 27) with new programming, state of the art studios and more international news coverage courtesy of its partnership with CNN.\n\nAccording to CNN, the new-look channel marks Antena 3’s status as CNN’s Exclusive News Partner in Romania and follows months of the Antena 3 team working closely with CNN on all aspects of the channel, from revamping production and broadcasting through to newsgathering.

Following months of collaboration and hard work from CNN and Antena 3, the new-look Antena 3 will build on the success of News Hour with CNN and bring a different, high quality news product to the Romanian market”.\n\nGadea added: “The eleven years during which we been affiliated to CNN have been full of events and times of change important not only to Romania but also in the history of the whole world.\n\n“The strengthening of our companies’ partnership to enhance Antena 3’s output and become CNN’s Exclusive News Partner in Romania comes at an important time. This development is not just a key milestone for Antena 3 but also for Romania and our country’s media industry as we prepare to deliver news that upholds the very highest standards of journalism”.",

    "Rain on the range – Getting muddy with NATO’s multinational battlegroup in Romania": "Earlier this year, Allies agreed to enhance NATO’s presence in the east of the Alliance by establishing four new multinational battlegroups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia (in addition to the existing battlegroups in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, which have been in place since 2017). Now, Allied troops are training together in these new battlegroups, demonstrating their ability and commitment to working together – come rain or come shine.\n\nFrench soldiers observe a live-fire exercise at the new NATO multinational battlegroup in Romania, where they are working alongside their Polish and Romanian counterparts.\n\nFor a soldier, rain is a fact of life.\n\nIt streams from the brim of your Kevlar helmet. It plasters your cold, wet combat uniform to your skin. And it turns the Romanian soil of Cincu Training Area into cake-batter mud that gloms onto your boots and adds a kilogram to every step.\n\nBut for these French soldiers assembled for a live-fire exercise, the rain seemed like an afterthought. They stood outside their armoured personnel carriers, which were parked in a line beside Polish and Romanian infantry fighting vehicles, waiting for the order to move out. Perhaps they’d simply grown used to the weather after several months of being deployed to Romania as part of the NATO Response Force.\n\nThe call came down the line: “Allons-y.” Let’s go. The French, Polish and Romanian soldiers grabbed their rifles and ducked into the cramped confines of their vehicles for the short ride to the gunnery range.\n\nFrench soldiers get into position under cloudy grey skies during a live-fire exercise in Cincu, Romania.\n\nThe French Army – which in 2022 is serving as the lead nation of the highest-readiness element of the NATO Response Force – deployed troops to Romania following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, alongside a contingent of Belgian soldiers. In May, the French and Belgians formally stood up NATO’s first multinational battlegroup in Romania, with a contingent of Dutch soldiers due to arrive in the coming months.\n\nThe battlegroup is backed up by rotational deployments of US and Polish mechanised infantry elements – including troops from the US Army’s 2nd Cavalry Regiment, forward deployed from Vilseck, Germany, and the Polish Army’s 17th Mechanised Brigade. While not under direct NATO command, these units greatly enhance the Alliance’s defensive posture while giving their troops invaluable time to cross-train with their Allies.\n\nPolish soldiers hold positions following a live-fire exercise in Cincu, Romania.\n\nAs the French, Polish and Romanian armoured vehicles raced towards the firing line underneath dark, woolly clouds, it was hard to shake the sense that this felt different from your standard exercise – the gloomy sky matched the mood of the continent, where Russia’s war against Ukraine has shattered peace and created the biggest security crisis in Europe since the Second World War.\n\nThe vehicles came to a halt and opened fire at simulated targets downrange, the .50-calibre machine gun mounted on the French armoured personnel carrier chattering against the deeper chug-chug-chug of the 30-millimeter autocannons mounted on the Polish and Romanian vehicles. After laying down a blanket of suppressing fire, the hatches opened and the soldiers spilled out, sprinting towards their firing positions.\n\nFor a few minutes, every rifle on the firing line was sending rounds downrange, soldiers pausing only to change magazines. Combined with sustained cannon fire from the infantry fighting vehicles, the volume of firepower was deafening. When it was over, the only sound was the voices of French, Polish and Romanian platoon leaders confirming over the radios that they’d spent all their ammunition. The soldiers mounted up and headed back to camp on the groan of diesel engines.\n\nA soldier with the French Army’s 93rd Mountain Artillery Regiment crawls under a barbed wire obstacle in Cincu, Romania. Troops go through a wide variety of physical tests and training in NATO multinational battlegroups, in addition to live-fire exercises.\n\nAlong with the other new battlegroups in Bulgaria, Hungary and Slovakia, NATO’s multinational battlegroup in Romania is a tangible manifestation of how European security has changed since February. While Allied soldiers routinely deployed to Romania in the past for training exercises, their permanent presence comes with a palpable sense of gravity.\n\n“In the first week of the deployment, we felt that it was a very important historical moment,” said Lieutenant Colonel Adrien, deputy commander of the battlegroup. He had deployed with the first French forces activated as part of the NATO Response Force.\n\n“We also felt the responsibility that we had as leaders of this spearhead battalion,” he explained, “the responsibility that we have to demonstrate our capabilities to be ready, totally, with our Allies to fulfil the mission that we have been given.”\n\nNATO troops from across the Alliance have continued to arrive at all four new battlegroups over the past several months, as they carry out the process of being set up and integrated into NATO’s military command structure. No matter where they’re from or where they’re deployed, these soldiers will stand side-by-side with their Allies and live, work and train in the toughest conditions – whether there are blue skies or grey skies ahead.",

I wish this because there is a special situation in the market. [More] natural gas is needed in the market and Romania can play a role. I think the Offshore Law is clear enough. I believe a decision will be made by the end of this year,\" said the government official.\n\nRomania sweetened the Offshore Law earlier this year and Romgaz took over Exxon Mobile’s 50% stake in the Neptun Deep project, with an estimated reserve of 48bn-84bn cubic meters of natural gas.\n\nSeparately, Popescu said that Romgaz will begin extracting gas from its onshore deep Caragele field in 2024.\n\nDiscovered in 2016 some 100 km from Bucharest, Caragele field was initially supposed to come online in 2019.\n\nTwo years later, in 2018, the deadline was already deferred to 2021-2022.\n\nMore recently, this year, Popescu was speaking of 2023 as the most likely moment for beginning production at Caragele.\n\nThe deposit has an estimated accumulation of gas of roughly 25bn-27bn cubic metres, amounting to the country's entire consumption for up to three years.

    "Romania is second-largest digital commerce market in CEE, McKinsey says": "Romania’s digital commerce market stood at EUR 9.8 bln in 2021, making it the second largest market in CEE, after Poland (EUR 26.7 bln) but before Czechia (EUR 9.1 bln). The achievement takes place in a wider context of digital development in Europe and within Romania itself, according to a new McKinsey & Company report titled “Digital Challengers on the Next Frontier.”\n\nThe report analyzes the opportunities presented by the digital economy in ten economies of Central and Eastern Europe, small and medium-sized countries with strong potential for fast digitization. The three main components of the digital economy considered in the report are: digital commerce (online retail spending on goods & services), ICT (the value of spending of governments and companies across all sectors on hardware, software, infrastructure, and related services) and offline spend on digital equipment (PC, smartphones, IT infrastructure, Cloud, etc.).\n\nThe region’s digital economy totaled an estimated EUR 124 bln in 2021, with digital commerce representing around EUR 68 bln of the sum. The ten CEE countries, Romania among them, could reach a digital economy worth EUR 330 bln by 2030, with digital commerce being the main driver of growth.\n\nRomania’s own digital economy was estimated at EUR 14.8 bln in 2021, or 6% of GDP, in the same report. The value is shared between digital commerce (EUR 9.8 bln), expenditures on ICT (EUR 3.5 bln), and offline spending on digital products like PCs or smartphones (EUR 1.6 bln). McKinsey analysts reckon that the sector could be worth EUR 52 bln (9.6% of GDP) by 2030.\n\nICT showed promise in Romania, growing at around 8% annually between 2017 and 2021. However, investments in this sector are still low when compared to countries such as Poland or Czechia. As Romania’s ICT infrastructure develops, it may become an important driver of growth.\n\nDigital commerce, however, is the clear driver of Romania’s digital economy, representing 66% of it. The segment grew by 17% annually, almost doubling in value between 2017 and 2021. The share of SMEs selling online more than doubled as well, from 7% to 17% in the same period. The spectacular growth transformed Romania into the second largest digital commerce market in the CEE, not to mention the third-largest digital economy.\n\nThere is, however, still room to grow. The average expenditure on digital commerce per capita and the digital commerce penetration rate in Romania are some of the lowest in the region. Romania’s digital commerce per capita was around EUR 506 in 2021, lower than the ones in Czechia (EUR 849), Slovenia (EUR 866), or Lithuania (EUR 1,064). Digital represents just 14% of the total retail segment in Romania, the rest being offline commerce. With 14% penetration, Romania has one of the lowest rates of digital commerce relative to total retail in the CEE.\n\nThe use of innovations delivering ultra-convenience (payments, omnichannel, fast delivery and returns, and data-driven individualization) could help Romania double its digital commerce market size.\n\nThe report shows that the most significant categories for digital commerce in Romania are home goods and electronics (39% share of digital commerce), transportation services (31%), and apparel (14%). However, during the pandemic years, the fastest category growth was seen in groceries, which grew from EUR 123 mln (2% share of digital commerce) in 2019 to EUR 389 mln in 2021 (4% share of digital commerce).\n\nradu@romania-insider.com\n\n(Photo source: Nitsuki | Dreamstime.com)",

    "EC wants energy reduction measures, Romania’s already lowest in Europe": "The average Romanian consumed 2.7 MWh in 2020, placing the country last in a ranking measuring energy consumption per capita in Europe.\n\nBy comparison, Ukraine’s average per capita energy consumption in the same year stood at 2.8 MWh, while Germans consumed 6.4 MWh per inhabitant in the same period. These values pale in comparison with the champions of per capita energy use in Europe, namely Norway (23.3 MWh) and Iceland (51 MWh), both outside the EU.\n\nOther figures serve to further contextualize Romania’s energy climate. The country’s energy consumption dropped by 19.48% since 1990, and its CO2 emissions by 58.33% in the same period, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\n“95% of Romania’s energy consumption in the ‘90s was industrial, households accounting for the rest,” energy and infrastructure analyst Otilia Nuţu told ZF. Energy consumption is especially low in the countryside, the least developed areas in Romania, she says.\n\nLast week, the European Commission unveiled a series of “exceptional electricity demand reduction measures” meant to reduce the cost of electricity throughout the winter. The Commission hopes to tackle high energy prices brought about by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent energy crisis.\n\nOne of the measures will have states reduce electricity consumption by at least 5% during selected peak price hours. Member states will also have to reduce overall electricity demand by at least 10% until March 31, 2023.\n\n“Our problem is that we don’t even have the data. We don’t know how energy is consumed in Romania. We have the same production method, with very large units, close to the old former industrial units, while our consumption has moved to the urban area,” Nuţu says.\n\nDespite massive deindustrialization, households only take up around 25% of the energy consumed in Romania, while the European average stands at 27%. Few devices using electricity have made their way to the country’s rural households, something which can translate into something akin to an advantage in the coming period.\n\nradu@romania-insider.com\n\n(Photo source: prudencio_alvarez | dreamstime.com)",

    "Daddy Daughter Charity Ball raises funds for public kindergarten libraries in Romania’s rural areas": "A new edition of the Daddy Daughter Charity Ball took place in September at the Cesianu-Racovița Palace in Bucharest, raising funds for the OvidiuRo Association with the purpose of stimulating reading among kindergarten children. During the event, fifty fathers and their daughters joined forces to equip the libraries of rural kindergartens in Romania where vulnerable children study.\n\n\"Besides raising awareness and money for the social cause we chose, the purpose of our charity ball is to raise our children in the spirit of philanthropy. We want them to learn to give much more than they received and will receive throughout their lives. There are a lot of children in Romania who have nothing or very little, so the cause we chose to support this year and for the foreseeable future is the \"Read me 100 stories!\" campaign initiated by the OvidiuRo Association,\" said Mike Costache, co-founder of the Daddy Daughter Charity Ball.\n\n\"Over the past two years, 475,000 books were purchased from the top ten children's publishing houses and were put into the hands of 200,000 children learning at the 1,966 kindergartens across Romania, which completed the certification process. All this was made possible through the hard work of ten wonderful OvidiuRo employees and with the support of two million euros provided by several major donors and a few dozen smaller donors,\" he added.\n\nMany of the fathers who attended the event chose to \"adopt\" a kindergarten that will bear their family name, dedicated in the name of their daughter(s), in exchange for 13 monthly donations of EUR 100 or EUR 1,300 donated in advance. The organisers said this is how much it costs to equip a Kinder Library and to train the educators to properly read children the various 100 stories.\n\nThe breakdown of the EUR 1,300 is as follows: EUR 150 books/professor, EUR 100 books/kid's group (4 groups on average per kindergarten), EUR 50 training/professor, and EUR 100/kindergarten (logistics & monitoring implementation activity).\n\n\"On behalf of the small team of just ten colleagues, we thank you all for joining the cause we are working on.

From stunning landscapes and popular tourist destinations and landmarks to people, traditions, and food, this series helps you discover Romania one photo at a time. This week, we put the focus on Romanian mountain lakes.\n\nThe small glacial Lake Vinderel is located on the ridge connecting Farcău Peak and Mihăilecu Peak, at an altitude of 1615m on the territory of Repedea and Poienile de Sub Munte, in the Maramureș Mountains. (Photo source - click on the number to get to the photo 172655297 © Volodymyr Martyniuk | Dreamstime.com)\n\nThe geological, faunal, and landscape reserve covers an area of 150 hectares, which is part of the Maramureș Mountains Natural Park, and aims to preserve the local biological diversity, says infopensiuni.ro. The reserve includes the Farcău and Mihăilecu peaks, Julii Cave, Bologhii Cave, Wolves’ Cave, and Vinderel Lake.\n\nThe lake is fed by snowmelt and rainwater, and by the small basins of swamp-like water located on its southern shore. The banks are grassy and slope gently down to the lake, says Bogatiile Muntilor Maramures, with some juniper thickets to the east. Other species of plants found on the edge of the lake are Edelweiss, Peat Mosses, Cottongrass, and Hawkweed.\n\nVinderel Lake has given rise to many legends, some of which describe it as a bottomless lake, others saying it is inhabited by a dragon that feeds on whoever might enter its water. One such tale, told by Stirileprotv.ro, says the dragon once ate all the guests at a wedding that was held by the lake’s side. It is also said that it is not good to throw a stone into this lake because you will start a storm.\n\nMaramureș Mountains Natural Park's website tells us of two different hiking trails that can be followed, if you want to visit Vinderel Lake:\n\nRepedea - Chicerea – Vinderel Lake\n\nTrail marking: Blue stripe\n\nTrail length: 10 km\n\nTrail duration: 4-5 hours\n\nDifficulty: medium, difficult in winter.\n\nFrom the center of Repedea the marker follows the lane leading to the school. From the corner of the school, the marked path changes direction to the east, winding its way up through the small farms in the Poposală area. Enter the forest, leaving the ridge and Chicera Peak to the left. One then reaches the stable in Laba. From here the path climbs steeply, passing the Runea hut and leaving the Rugașul ridge on the right. Then you reach an area from where you can see the Farcău massif. The trail continues, crossing several torrential streams, and after approximately 1 hour, you reach Vinderel Lake.\n\nRepedea - Pietriceaua – Vinderel Lake\n\nTrail marking: Blue stripe\n\nTrail length: 12 km\n\nTrail duration: 4-5 hours\n\nDifficulty: medium, winter difficult.\n\nFrom the center of the village, the marker follows the road along the Repedea valley, and after approx. 4 km you reach the Repedea Forest Canton. Continue on the road until the confluence with the Tomnatecu valley. From here you cross the Repedea valley, going up to the mountain hollow below Pietriceaua. You keep going north until you reach the lake.\n\nmaia@romania-insider.com",

It must cede the territories of Hungary (Transcarpathia), Poland (Galicia), Romania (Bukovina), and Russia (Donbas and Crimea). These are the territories of other countries,” he said.\n\nMarga added that at present, the conflict could only be resolved through negotiations with Russia mediated by America, Germany, and China.\n\nMoreover, Marga said that in Ukraine, “we are not talking about democracy”: “There is still a long way to democracy. Parties are banned there, and television is controlled by one of them. Some very wealthy people leave the country with money. The country, from which people leave with money, with everything, cannot be either democratic or developed.”\n\nIn turn, the Ukrainian embassy in Romania replied that such statements are unacceptable under any circumstances: “They are a particularly egregious violation at a time when Ukraine is heroically defending its independence and the security of all of Europe.”\n\n“We regret that the former minister of the European democratic state, Marga, is making statements that question the basic principles of international law, especially the inviolability of borders.

We've certainly made mistakes – that's the reality of it,” said Burduja.\n\nThe shift in attitude is driven by the recognition it is in the government’s interest to complete the installation of the beam. “We see it as an essential part of Romanian infrastructure, but also an essential part of European knowledge and access to knowledge,” Burduja said. “It's a project that's never been done in the world, it has huge potential, it would be a huge shame not to finish it according to the parameters that were set in the beginning.”\n\nThe complications, though, do not end here because after the contract with EuroGammaS was cancelled, a US company Lyncean Technologies was handed a €42 million deal to take over and complete construction on the gamma beam. But in March this year the journal Science reported rumours that the company was facing bankruptcy.\n\nBurduja said the Romanian government has not received any definitive communication from the company on this matter. “We're evaluating to see their capacity to carry the project all the way to the end and essentially finalise the gamma source,” he said.\n\nAccording to Burduja, Lyncean had some financial trouble in the past couple of years, but he is not yet aware of the company declaring bankruptcy. “I think it's public information that they've had some challenges during the pandemic but to my knowledge they have made no formal notification [about the bankruptcy issue] at this point,” he said.\n\nScience|Business did not receive any response from Lyncean to emails asking about its capacity to complete the project.\n\nBurduja said that if the company is unable to complete the project they would look at alternative options, including going back to the EuroGammaS consortium.\n\nDeadlines, penalties and litigation\n\nThe ELI-NP project has already gone through two phases of EU funding, and cannot be “phased” again. It means that the facility needs to be completed by the end of 2023 to maintain its EU funding. There is a two-year buffer in which, if the project is not fully completed, the Romanian government can step in and fund it with its own resources.\n\nIf it is not completed after that buffer, which means by the end of 2025, then Romania risks a heavy penalty from the European Commission, something Burduja says it wants to avoid. The facility is being built at a total cost of €300 million, most of which is from EU structural funds, with only a small portion being covered by the Romanian government.\n\nThe project remains in limbo and cannot move forward because of the ongoing court cases over the cancellation of the first contract with EuroGammaS. This is eating into the time left to complete it, but Burduja said there is the possibility of an amicable settlement.\n\nOne possibility is that an agreement is reached about the terms of the first contract. For example, the completion of stage one of the construction of the gamma beam – there were three planned stages – could be deemed satisfactory in terms of meeting the contract requirements.\n\nThe equipment delivered to the facility as part of that first stage could also eventually be used to build a radioactive beam infrastructure that could be a tool for nuclear research.\n\nPierluigi Campana, a member of the executive board of the Italian Institute of Nuclear Physics (INFN), one of the main partners in the EuroGammaS consortium, has been following the events at ELI-NP for several years and says the situation is “very complex”.\n\nAccording to Campana, things are now better, although INFN still needs some political action from the Romanian government. “We cannot hope to build the full [gamma beam] machine by 2025 because we have wasted so much time,” he said, admitting that the terms of the EuroGammaS contract could be amended so only phase one needs to be completed.\n\nCampana said he feels the situation is moving forward positively and that recently steps have been taken by the Romanian government to resolve the issues. He spoke to Burduja at the end of July to lay out the situation and said the conclusion was that “the best path is to conclude the legal issues.”\n\nBurduja has also held talks with the Italian and French ambassadors to Romania, both of whose countries had stakes in EuroGammaS, to try to smooth out relations, as the contract dispute has had an impact on Romania’s international reputation.\n\n“The very horrible way of treating international partners was not without consequences. The whole scientific community of Romania is suffering,” Campana said. “On the other hand, our institutions have suffered because they put a lot of resources into a project that was blocked for years and this was devastating.”\n\nScience|Business also contacted another EuroGammaS partner, France’s national research centre CNRS, but it declined to comment on the situation.\n\nCampana said that despite the history, EuroGammaS would still work with Romania.\n\nAt the end of September there will be a technical meeting in Rome with representatives of Romania and the consortium to discuss how best to use the ELI-NP facility, an indication the research and science element is moving forward in spite of the politics. The general opinion of those directly or indirectly involved with ELI-NP is that science, research and the pursuit of knowledge is more important than what is going on in Bucharest courts.\n\nAnother indicator of this is ELI-NP’s growing involvement in the European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC). ELI-NP was built as part of a triumvirate of laser research facilities in central and eastern Europe.\n\nIn Hungary there is the ELI Alps institute and in Czech Republic there is ELI Beamlines. These two other facilities have come together to form the ELI European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC), which ELI-NP was left out of, due in part to the bad relations that came about after the cancellation of the EuroGammaS contract.\n\nELI-ERIC recently put out a call for users at the three laser institutions, with the deadline on September 9. The first projects are due to start in October and last until March. A second call for users will be put out in January 2023.\n\nAllen Weeks, director general of ELI ERIC, said he is very pleased that the call went out with the involvement of IFIN-HH and ELI-NP. “This demonstrates that all the facilities are working closely together, on a scientific level, to deliver the best and most advanced portfolio of laser sources in the world to the global science community,” he said.\n\nWeeks said he could not put a timeframe on ELI-NP fully joining ERIC, but is optimistic it will happen as the facility nears completion.\n\nELI-NP director Călin Ur agreed with this assessment, saying, “Even if we are not part of ERIC, we are participating in the process of defining the rules that will govern the consortium in such a way that when we join, we will be prepared to do so immediately and to be effective.” ELI-NP has received a high number of requests as part of ELI ERIC’s call for users.\n\nNicolae Marginean, director general of the IFIN-HH, stressed the need to talk about the potential of the ELI-NP facility rather than the contract disputes over the gamma beam.\n\nThe facility has huge potential, particularly the high intensity laser system which is equipped with two 10-petawatt lasers. This unique capability will allow scientists to carry out research on improving X-ray imaging, fine tuning the use of radiotherapy in cancer treatment, investigating how materials will react to radiation in space and more.\n\nTesting on the laser system is ongoing but successful trials of it at 100 terawatts and one petawatt have already been conducted. Ur said that the team of international experts brought in to run the trials described the facility as “one of the best in the world” in terms of the characteristics and quality of the beam.\n\nIf the issues with the gamma beam can be resolved and ELI-NP gets fully up and running, then there is little doubt that Romania will have a world-class facility capable of attracting the best and brightest talent from around the world. Marginean said it will be, “A cluster of excellence in nuclear science.”\n\nFor Ur, it is vital that the project is a success. “We have to demonstrate that we are capable of handling large research projects,” he said.\n\nThe Bucharest facility will help Romania stop the brain drain and attract research talent from around the world. “Most are going abroad to do research because the offer here in terms of research equipment is limited […] was limited,” he said. “Now, by having these possibilities, we can bring back people who left Romania and we can bring researchers from around the world to work here.”\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated 16 September 2022.

    "Out-of-pocket payments for health care in Romania undermine progress towards universal health coverage": "Romania has a high incidence of catastrophic health spending compared to other European Union (EU) countries, a new report by WHO/Europe finds. In 2015, 1 in 8 households incurred out-of-pocket payments that exceeded 40% of their capacity to pay for health care, the report reveals. Catastrophic health spending means a household can no longer afford to meet other basic needs, such as food, housing and electricity.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report produced by the WHO Barcelona Office for Health Systems Financing is the first comprehensive analysis of financial protection – otherwise known as affordable access to health care – in Romania. The analysis shows that catastrophic health spending is heavily concentrated among the poorest 40% of households and older people. It is mainly driven by out-of-pocket payments for outpatient medicines, followed by dental care and outpatient care.\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween 2010 and 2015, the incidence of catastrophic health spending grew, particularly among poorer households. Although access to health care improved during this period, the rates of unmet need for health care and dental care in Romania continue to be well above the EU average.\n\nGaps in coverage\n\nReforms introduced in the last few years have expanded the range of health benefits provided by Romania’s National Health Insurance House (NHIH), and levels of public spending on health have increased.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite these positive developments, the report also draws attention to persistent gaps in health coverage.\n\n12% of the population is uninsured and can only access a few publicly-financed health services. People need to pay health insurance contributions to access NHIH benefits, which some people with low incomes cannot afford.\n\nExemptions from user charges (co-payments) for prescribed medicines do not target people with low incomes, and there is no overall cap on co-payments. Balance billing and extra billing by health care providers is also problematic and undermines transparency.\n\nAccess to dental care is limited due to budget constraints.\n\nOther factors that contribute to financial hardship and unmet need include:\n\ninformal payments to health workers and for medicines and supplies, particularly in inpatient care;\n\nissues with service quality and ageing infrastructure in public hospitals; and\n\na shortage of health facilities and professionals in rural areas.\n\nMaking access to health care affordable for everyone\n\nThe new report sets out a series of policy recommendations to improve access and financial protection in Romania. These include the need to:\n\nensure the whole population is covered by the NHIH and has access to the same set of benefits;\n\nextend exemptions from co-payments to low-income households and introduce an income-based cap on all co-payments;\n\nlimit the ability of health care providers to charge people additional user charges through balance billing and extra billing;\n\ncontinue to improve the way in which the NHIH purchases medicines, including over-the-counter medicines;\n\nstrengthen the coverage and purchasing of dental care to address high levels of unmet needs in the poorest households;\n\naddress informal payments, starting with better monitoring; and\n\nsupport these changes with increased public investment in the health system; public spending on health is still low in Romania compared to most EU countries, at 4.6% of GDP in 2019 compared to an EU average of 6%.\n\nWHO supports countries in moving towards universal health coverage\n\nFinancial protection is central to universal health coverage, which is at the heart of the European Programme of Work, WHO/Europe’s strategic framework. Through the WHO Barcelona Office for Health Systems Financing, WHO/Europe monitors financial protection in over 40 countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial protection is an indicator of the Sustainable Development Goals and part of the European Pillar of Social Rights. The WHO Barcelona Office provides tailored technical assistance to countries to reduce unmet need and financial hardship by identifying and addressing gaps in coverage.",
    "Customer experience in Romania": "For two consecutive years, the Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT) across six core Romanian industries are within a 10 percent range of each other, showing a lack of distinctive leaders; more than 90 percent of companies have a customer satisfaction score between 8 and 9, similar with last year.\n\nThis limited improvement could be explained by a mix of a lack of focus on improving customer experience along with a lack of speed and agility in adapting products and services, as no player managed to significantly improve its position within one year. The banking and retail industries were rated best this year, with a CSAT score of 8.8, while utilities landed last at 7.7.\n\nOverall, Romanian consumers don’t perceive any one company as standing out from the crowd regarding customer experience, but in 2022 emerging leaders and laggards are apparent, particularly in utilities, healthcare, and banking.\n\nSidebar LinkedIn\n\nTwitter\n\nFacebook\n\nEmail Survey methodology The McKinsey Customer Experience Romania Survey is an annual survey that checks the pulse of the Romanian market, tracking the evolution of customer experience and delivering actionable insights for local companies. Launched in 2021 for the first time, the survey looks at the experience of Romanian customers across six industries: grocery retail, telecommunications, utilities, banking, insurance, and healthcare. This year, approximately 3,000 respondents were asked to rate their Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT) on a scale from one to ten for each of the companies they use in the different industries.\n\nThis article, based on the most recent McKinsey Customer Experience in Romania (see sidebar, “Survey methodology”), as well as the 2021 edition of the survey, seeks to understand the customer-experience landscape of Romanian companies in six major industries. This new piece of research highlights significant opportunities for companies that aspire to differentiate themselves on the Romanian market and offers good case practices on how to begin to stand out from the crowd.\n\nLast year’s insights confirmed in 2022\n\nBetter customer experience leads to increased customer spend and higher market shares\n\nCustomer experience can be understood as the full delivery of a company’s brand promise via its products, price, service, and communication. Superior customer experience enables deep customer trust and loyalty, while also having a positive impact on costs (for example, a 20–50 percent decrease in service costs by lowering the volume of complaints), revenues (a 15–20 percent increase in sales conversion) and customer satisfaction (a 10–20 percent increase). Superior customer experience has also been shown to help companies deal with past financial crises: customer-experience champions suffer less and recover faster than customer-experience underperformers do.\n\nThe McKinsey survey of Romanian consumers confirms for two consecutive years many of these previous findings. It identifies a clear link between customer experience and willingness to spend: for a customer satisfaction score higher than 87, every point increase in CSAT score is likely to drive an additional 32–34 percentage points of increased spending. It also shows that market share and customer experience are closely correlated, with top-quartile companies by market share also displaying the highest CSAT scores (Exhibit 1). Clearly, an opportunity exists for Romanian companies to differentiate themselves from their peers through the customer experience they offer, and making improvements in this area should be a top priority for Romanian business leaders.\n\nExhibit 1 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website.

Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\n\nThoughtful digitization is key to achieving higher CSAT scores\n\nThis year’s survey confirmed that, with the notable exception of banks, higher levels of digital engagement haven’t resulted in improved customer experience in Romania. For instance, interactions with customers in retail are still predominantly nondigital, yet the industry has a high CSAT score (8.8), whereas the reverse is true for utilities (7.7). This trend is likely driven by rudimentary and noncustomer-centric digitization, in which cumbersome, mandatory digital interactions are more likely to decrease than to increase customer satisfaction. This finding also highlights the importance of a thoughtful, integrated approach to digitizing customer experience, such as a consistent omnichannel approach.\n\nThis recommendation is particularly relevant as the survey identified distinct preferences among Romanian consumers, such as the ability to switch smoothly between different channels (online versus in person) depending on the customer journey. Thus, in-person interactions are preferred for resolving issues, whereas online is preferred for everyday use. Preferences also differ by customer age group: younger consumers are less satisfied on average than older ones, with the largest gaps in insurance (a CSAT score of 8.1 versus 8.6) and utilities (7.8 versus 8.3). This may also be an area in which companies would wish to make targeted improvements in their offerings or services.\n\nTailoring customer experiences to reflect their preferences regarding interaction type and preferred channels should move up on the agenda of Romanian companies. Progress could be achieved, for instance, by improving customer relationship management (CRM) capabilities and developing microcampaigns tailored to different customer groups. An earlier McKinsey study found that when a one-size-fits-all sales approach is replaced by offers tailored to individual customer profiles, it can generate a revenue increase of up to 30 percent or more.\n\nHigher customer satisfaction levels can be achieved by increasing customer trust in the brand, derived from choice, fairness, and product performance\n\nThe survey analyzed the contribution of four different customer experience drivers—brand, price, customer service, and product. Brand emerged as the most important contributor in all industries except for banking (in which product and price are more important).\n\nFor each of the four drivers, their contributing elements were ranked by their importance to customers. Romanian companies may wish to develop targeted actions that address each of these high-impact elements specifically for their industry. For instance, to improve product, banks could work on ensuring that their products meet all customer needs, while insurance companies could ensure their products are perceived as secure and reliable.\n\nFor banks, that might translate into spending more time with customers trying to understand whether their products really meet their needs; insurance companies might want to highlight the extent and benefits of their coverage in their communication with consumers.\n\nSimilarly, to improve customer service, healthcare, and utilities companies could invest in helping customers get support and resolve seamlessly their issues, while telecommunications companies could ensure that services for everyday use (such as checking balances) are in line with customer expectations. This might involve mapping out each customer journey step-by-step and testing new features with customers.\n\nWhat’s new in 2022?\n\nA focus (or lack thereof) on customer experience leads to the emergence of potential leaders/laggards\n\nThe 2022 survey showed that despite the relatively flat Romanian landscape, banks have managed to have the highest growth in customer satisfaction scores, and they have become the leading industry in Romania in terms of CSAT, dethroning last year’s leading industry, retail, which has remained flat.\n\nThe 2022 survey showed that despite the relatively flat Romanian landscape, banks have managed to have the highest growth in customer satisfaction scores.\n\nMoreover, within banking and utilities, certain players have grown their CSAT scores by almost one percentage point compared with 2021. In these industries, as well as telecom, we see the industry leader getting detached from the rest of the market players, suggesting a potential emergence of industry leaders as well as a clear nomination of the industry laggards, which are slow to invest and improve their customer experience (Exhibit 2).\n\nExhibit 2 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website.

Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\n\nRomanian consumers feel that companies don’t act in their interest\n\nThe 2022 survey also analyzed how Romanian consumers feel about companies acting in their interest for the past three years. Consumers perceive that Romanian companies don’t act in their interest, with the highest percentage of consumers naming insurance and utilities (64 percent for each) as the industries that never act in their customers’ interests (Exhibit 3). At the other end, healthcare is perceived as the industry that is most willing to act in their customers’ interest (44 percent of respondents).\n\nExhibit 3 We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. If you would like information about this content we will be happy to work with you. Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com\n\nCompanies across sectors can improve the perceived level of commitment toward customers’ interests by focusing on seamless resolutions of customer complaints, simplifying customer claims processes, and improving staff goodwill.\n\nPrice is the main factor that would trigger customers to change their provider\n\nIn 2022, price has been nominated as the main factor to trigger a change of providers, followed by a better product and customer service. The weight of price in switching providers is higher in utilities, insurance, and retail, and the lowest in banking. This can be explained by the ease of changing providers in industries such as retail, with low opportunity costs.\n\nThe cyclicity of choosing a provider in insurance, as well as the new regulations in the Romanian energy market for utilities, gave Romanian consumers the opportunity to make price comparisons and switch providers. Moreover, in utilities and insurance, prices increased significantly in 2021 due to a supply-driven global energy crisis in utilities and due to the bankruptcy of City Insurance (the biggest player in the market for RCA, third-party liability auto insurance), which historically was the cheapest player in the market. Such significant price increases made consumers even more sensitive to this factor.\n\nAnother reason for the price being the main factor for switching providers is the fact that price is the most visible driver of customer satisfaction to consumers. Customer awareness of superior product performance and customer service is lower, and thus presents an opportunity to be capitalized on, to allow companies to achieve price differentiation in the future.\n\nNext steps\n\nThe Romanian economy is expected to undergo significant changes in the coming years, with the industries studied in the survey at the forefront of this transformation. Moreover, the macroeconomic environment is putting additional pressure on disposable income, making Romanian consumers savvier and more cautious with how they spend their money, increasing willingness to shop around before making a buying decision.\n\nBanks and insurance companies would be well advised to focus, among other things, on improving customer loyalty and increasing the adoption of financial products. Telecommunications companies could look at how to best use new technology, such as 5G, to serve emerging or unmet customer needs. Retailers can respond to the growth of digital channels, while utilities will want to address the recent market liberalization, and healthcare providers may want to address the growing needs of an aging population and the limitations of the public system.\n\nAcross these industries, customer experience will be a crucial and much needed axis for growth—and an area where clear leaders have yet to emerge. The pursuit of better customer experience should have a positive impact not only on individual companies’ commercial success but also on the overall well-being and living standards of Romanian consumers.\n\nWhile some companies have improved the experience offered to their customers, there is no clear leader emerging in the six industries that were analyzed on the Romanian market. Improving in this area should be high priority for any company, as better customer experience leads to increased customer spend and higher market shares. Romanian companies can start by thoughtfully digitizing their products and services to achieve higher CSAT scores. Although in most industries customers are interacting with companies more and more via digital channels, there is limited to no improvement in customer satisfaction, showing a rudimentary or noncustomer-focused digitization. Furthermore, higher customer satisfaction levels can be achieved by increasing customer trust in the brand, derived from choice, fairness, and product performance.",

    "IAEA Team in Romania Concludes First Ever Site and External Events Design (SEED) Review for a Small Modular Reactor": "An International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) team of experts has concluded a safety review of Romania’s process for selecting the site of the country’s planned Small Modular Reactor (SMR), which could become the first SMR built in Europe.\n\nIn May, the Romanian Government, through state company Societatea Nationala Nuclearelectrica SA (SNN), announced that it had chosen Doicești, approximately 90 km northwest of the capital Bucharest, as the preferred site for the SMR, following an in-depth study conducted with a United States Trade and Development Agency grant. Romania requested the IAEA to conduct a Site and External Events Design (SEED) review mission to assess the process that was followed in choosing the preferred site. The SEED mission — which took place from 22 to 24 August — was the first ever IAEA SEED mission to look into site selection for an SMR.\n\nSEED missions assist IAEA Member States at different stages in the development of a nuclear power programme, including by reviewing site selection, site assessment and design of structures, systems and components, taking into consideration site specific external and internal hazards.\n\nThe three-day mission was conducted at the request of SNN. Romania currently has one operating nuclear power plant (NPP) in Cernavodă, which generates around 18% of the country’s electricity. The country is considering expanding and modernizing its nuclear power programme through the deployment of SMRs at suitable sites, in addition to other actions on the existing large plant site.\n\nSMRs have the potential to contribute to global access to reliable nuclear power. They are a fraction of the size of large reactors — about one-third of the generating capacity of traditional nuclear power reactors — and have lower upfront capital costs, shorter construction times (owing to prefabrication) and pose fewer risks to the population in case of an accident.\n\nThe IAEA’s review assessed how Romania conducted the process for the site selection of the SMR against IAEA safety standards, taking into account potential impacts to a site from external events, such as tsunamis, earthquakes and floods, and potential impacts to the population from low probability accidents at the site.\n\n“This comprehensive review will provide assurances to the Romanian public and beyond about the SMR site selection,” said Paolo Contri, Team Leader for the review and Head of the External Events Safety Section in the IAEA Department of Nuclear Safety and Security. “The recommendations made will help Romania to prepare for the construction of the SMR, by making sure that potential issues associated with site safety are carefully considered early in the process and that alternative sites are available in the event that the selected site does not meet the requirements on the basis of the detailed site characterization. It is important that potential external hazards are identified early to allow for adequate consideration and assessment of protective measures that may be necessary for the defence in depth approach.”\n\nThe mission team comprised three experts from Germany, Türkiye and the United Kingdom. They met with senior staff from SNN at its premises in Bucharest.\n\nThe team welcomed the effort spent by SNN to conduct an objective, feasible and safety oriented site selection process in Romania. Romania documented the site selection process in a preliminary SNN report, which will be followed by a preliminary Front-End Engineering and Design (FEED) study. The SEED mission said a limited amount of additional work is needed on sensitivity analysis and collection of confirmatory data for the FEED study, together with detailed recommendations on the minimization of project risks.\n\nThe team provided some recommendations to support the optimization of the site selection process and to minimize the risk that the following phases will identify important safety issues that may affect project implementation. In particular, the IAEA team recommended that:\n\nAll data be collected in a site selection summary report, according to the recommendations issued in IAEA Safety Guide SSG-35, to provide traceable support for later decisions and site evaluation phases.\n\nA suitable graded approach be applied for the specific technology selected for the SMR to be deployed, and in accordance with the potential radiological consequences of accidents, to meet overall safety objectives. Guidelines on the IAEA approach to grading were provided.\n\nA possible additional data collection phase for the selection process — through light investigation and monitoring — be implemented for the preferred site, as back-up solutions, focused on the most discriminating selection criteria.\n\nRomania informed the IAEA that further in-depth assessments of the Doicești site are to be conducted in the upcoming period and it is actively addressing the recommendations of the IAEA SEED mission to support this work.\n\n“We invited the IAEA SEED mission because it is a priority for us to build in Romania a state-of-the-art SMR project, in full compliance with the highest safety standards, as we have done in the 25 years we have operated the Cernavodă NPP,” said Cosmin Ghita, SNN CEO. “With the continued support of the IAEA, our experience in siting and building our first SMR can be used by other countries considering building SMRs.

    "DP World links new location in Romania with Ukrainian grain lifeline": "Port of Constanta\n\nDP World in Romania is working to facilitate grain exports from Ukraine via Romania while keeping a low profile. That being said, the global logistics player will utilise a recently authorised terminal in Dornesti, near the Romania-Ukraine border, to bring more grain flows towards the port of Constanta by rail.\n\nThe new rail link that could commence anytime soon will connect Vadul-Siret in Ukraine with the company’s hub terminal in the Port of Constanta via Dornesti. The latter was developed into a functioning terminal by DP World swiftly to alleviate congestion in Constanta and serve the company’s multimodal expansion in Romania.\n\nCosmin Carstea, CEO of DP World Romania, commented on the news website The Loadstar that the new rail service could run with up to five roundtrips per week, and trains could carry up to 50 containers per time.\n\nInvestment with future\n\nUnderstandably, a global player like DP World also sees a long-term benefit in such commitments. Apart from helping Ukrainian grain to find new rail routes toward Romania, the Dornesti terminal will also boost the company’s presence in the country. Apart from its hub terminal in the port of Constanta and Dornesti, DP World is also working in another location.\n\nSpecifically, in early May, the company kicked off the construction of a new multimodal logistics terminal in Aiud, in the region of Transylvania. As the company commented, “with over 50 per cent of Romania’s industrial GDP coming from the wider Transylvania region, the Aiud terminal will perform a key role in expanding the country’s global trade while providing robust infrastructure in a region that traditionally lacked it”. Additionally, DP World stressed that the terminal will “sit directly on the train line linking Europe to China via Central Asia”.\n\nAlso read:",
