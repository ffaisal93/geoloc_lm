    "Japan warns against speculative yen moves amid sharp declines": "Finance minister says government and Bank of Japan are on same page in sharing concerns about the currency’s fall.\n\nJapanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki has said that authorities stand ready to respond to speculative currency moves, a new warning that comes days after Tokyo intervened in the foreign exchange market to stem yen falls for the first time in more than 20 years.\n\nSuzuki also told a news conference on Monday the government and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) were on the same page in sharing concerns about the currency’s sharp declines.\n\n“We are deeply concerned about recent rapid and one-sided market moves driven in part by speculative trading,” Suzuki told a news conference. “There’s no change to our stance of being ready to respond as needed” to such moves, he added.\n\nThe remark came after the government’s decision on Thursday to intervene in the currency market to stem yen weakness by selling dollars and buying yen for the first time since 1998.\n\nThe yen’s recent sharp declines, which have pushed up households’ living costs by boosting imported fuel and food prices, have been driven in part by widening divergence between the US Federal Reserve’s aggressive monetary tightening and the BOJ’s ultra-loose monetary policy.\n\nBOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will deliver a speech to business leaders in Osaka, western Japan, later on Monday where he may comment on the yen and the government’s intervention.\n\nThe dollar added 0.29 percent to reach 143.78 yen on Monday, continuing its climb back toward Thursday’s 24-year peak of 145.90. It tumbled to 140.31 that same day after Japanese authorities stepped into the market.\n\nWhile government officials’ jawboning may keep markets nervous about the prospects of further intervention, stepping in repeatedly in the currency market and selling huge sums of dollars could be difficult due to the criticism Japan may face from its G7 counterparts.\n\n“It’s unlikely Japan will continue intervening to defend a certain line, such as 145 yen to the dollar,” former top Japanese currency diplomat Naoyuki Shinohara told the Reuters news agency.\n\nThe yen is not alone in its downward spiral. Several other currencies, including the British pound, the euro and the Chinese yuan have taken a hammering partly driven by the US Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest rate increases in recent months.",

    "Shinzo Abe funeral: world figures fly in to political storm over state service for Japan former PM": "The US vice-president, Kamala Harris, the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, and British foreign secretary, James Cleverly, will be among foreign dignitaries arriving in Japan to attend a state funeral for the assassinated former prime minister, Shinzo Abe, despite strong public opposition to the ceremony.\n\nThey will be among about 700 people from overseas, including 50 former and current leaders, who are expected to attend the funeral in Tokyo on Tuesday, almost three months after Abe was shot dead while making a campaign speech.\n\nPublic opinion was split when, six days after Abe’s death, the prime minister, Fumio Kishida, said his predecessor would be afforded a state funeral.\n\nBut opposition has intensified in recent weeks, amid a torrent of revelations about ties between Abe’s Liberal Democratic party (LDP) – now led by Kishida – and the Unification church.\n\nThe suspect in Abe’s shooting on 8 July, Tetsuya Yamagami, has told investigators he targeted the politician because of his ties to the church, whose members are commonly known as Moonies.\n\nYamagami reportedly said he harboured a two-decade grudge against the church after his mother, a member, donated a huge sum of money to the organisation and bankrupted his family.\n\nAbe was not a member of the church, but sent a congratulatory video message to a church-affiliated event last autumn.\n\nFounded in South Korea in 1954 by the self-proclaimed messiah Sun Myung Moon, the church was encouraged to establish a presence in Japan by Abe’s grandfather and postwar prime minister, Nobusuke Kishi, as a counter to communism and trade unionism. The organisation, known for its mass weddings, has been accused of pressuring believers into making donations they can’t afford – claims it has denied.\n\nAfter Abe’s shooting exposed serious errors by officers responsible for protecting him, organisers have planned strict security measures near the funeral venue.\n\nRoads around the Budokan will be closed and airspace will be restricted from Monday until Wednesday. Tens of thousands of police officers, including about 2,500 from outside the capital, have been deployed and sniffer dogs have been patrolling major railway stations and Haneda airport in recent days.\n\nJapanese media revelations that other members of the LDP – and a much smaller number from other parties – had attended church events or sought help from their members has dominated the domestic news for weeks. A survey conducted by the party found that 179 of its 379 lawmakers had interacted with the church.\n\nBut a call by Kishida for party MPs to cut their ties to the church has done little to quell growing anger at plans to spend an estimated ¥1.65bn ($12m) on the funeral, most of which will be go on security and hosting foreign delegations.\n\nKishida has seen his approval ratings plummet, while opinion polls show a majority of people oppose Tuesday’s ceremony. According to a recent poll by the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper, 62% of respondents said they objected to the ceremony. Some said Abe was not worthy of the honour, while others cited the cost.\n\nHolding a state funeral was a “big miscalculation” by Kishida, according to Tomoaki Iwai, professor emeritus at Nihon University.\n\n“When he originally decided on the funeral there were a lot of people in favour, but then there were the reports of Abe’s involvement with the Unification church, and so opposition grew.”\n\nWhile Abe’s economic and security policies received largely positive reviews abroad, he continues to be a divisive figure at home.\n\nCritics say he dragged the country to the right, treated the constitution with contempt and presided over an administration mired in cronyism and sleaze. Abe was implicated in major scandals but went on to become Japan’s longest-serving leader shortly before he resigned, citing poor health, in 2020.\n\nThe 4,300 funeral guests will include the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese as well as three of his predecessors, Singapore’s prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, and the European Council president, Charles Michel.",

    "As world gathers to honor Abe, Japan grapples with church’s influence": "Listen 8 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nTOKYO — For nearly two decades, public discussion of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party’s ties with the Unification Church was taboo in Japan. Now, the organization’s decades-long influence in Japanese politics is at the forefront of a political outcry. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight The turning point: The July 8 assassination of Shinzo Abe.\n\nDignitaries are gathering in Tokyo this week to commemorate Japan’s longest-serving prime minister. But the event has put a spotlight on the scandal ensnaring the ruling party over its links with the church and use of taxpayer money for the state funeral of a leader who was popular abroad but divisive at home.\n\nThe church has faced scrutiny after Tetsuya Yamagami, the suspected gunman, told police he wanted to carry out the assassination because his life and family had been ruined as a result of his mother’s large donations to a religious group to which Abe had apparent close ties. The Unification Church confirmed that Yamagami’s mother is a longtime member and that it had received donations from her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther families emerged to say that their lives were similarly upended because of donations made by their relatives, some of whom have ongoing legal battles with the Unification Church. The accounts highlighted a controversial practice known as “spiritual sales,” in which goods or services that supposedly possess supernatural powers were sold to members at often exorbitant prices.\n\n“When I first heard that Abe’s death was related to a certain religious organization, I knew right away, that … something huge was going to unfold,” said Eito Suzuki, a journalist who has been tracking the church’s activities since 2002. “There is no other cult aside from the Unification Church which extends so deeply and widely within Japanese politics, reaching the ruling party, opposition parties, and beyond.”\n\nChurch officials said in a news conference last week that they are unaware of spiritual sales made after 2009, when the group signed a legal agreement after facing criminal charges over the practice. The church has addressed anger over its links with the ruling party by saying that on various issues its stance tends to align with the LDP membership.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida has apologized for his party’s cozy relationship with the church and vowed to sever relations. He reshuffled his cabinet, removing leaders with the strongest links to the group, and surveyed members to identify their relationships with the organization.\n\nBut Kishida’s approval ratings have plummeted, especially after it emerged that several members of his new cabinet had ties to the church. Last week, Kishida said he would not call for an investigation into Abe’s ties with the church.\n\nThe public — and even some members of the LDP — are increasingly skeptical of the party’s ability to divorce itself. Even after the party released the names of officials who reported links to the church and its affiliates, another top LDP official acknowledged ties. The internal review has drawn further criticism from those demanding an independent investigation.\n\nIn light of the controversy, there has been a backlash against the government’s decision to host a state funeral for Abe — the first in 55 years and only the second in the postwar era. Hundreds of thousands of people have signed a petition to oppose the move, and thousands have protested in front of the Diet, Japan’s national assembly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJapan is not a particularly religious country, but the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification, the official name of the Unification Church, controls dozens of ministries in Japan.\n\nThe church’s roots in Japan date to 1968, when it founded a political organization, the International Federation for Victory over Communism, with the support of former prime minister Nobusuke Kishi, Abe’s grandfather, who had befriended the group’s founder, the Rev. Sun Myung Moon.\n\nThe group became a reliable partner for the LDP in rallying against communism and left-wing protests through the 1960s. In the 1980s, conservative politicians began receiving endorsements, donations and grass roots support from the group, Suzuki said.\n\nAs the Cold War ended, the group aligned with right-wing politicians over social issues, opposing the introduction of gender equality policies and sex education, according to its website.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Abe rose to power in the LDP and eventually became prime minister, the church’s members became a conservative voting bloc and mobilizing force, Suzuki said — an important source of support in a country that prohibits individual donations to political candidates.\n\n“We do not have a stance of asking members to support any specific party or one particular party,” Tomihiro Tanaka, president of the Japanese office of the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification, said at an August news conference. “Our fundamental stance is a stance in opposition to communism, so from that perspective there may be more points of encounter with members of the LDP.”\n\nOver those decades, Japan became the key profit center for the Unification Church and its offshoots, largely through door-to-door “spiritual sales” that often targeted grieving elderly people, according to several academic studies, government investigators and historians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese items included jars and miniature stone pagodas, which believers were told would absolve the sins of their ancestors for their occupation of South Korea, according to academic research. The group’s membership in Japan surpasses that of South Korea, where the organization was founded.\n\nThe Japanese government has set up a consumer affairs agency to investigate the proliferation of spiritual sales. It received more than 1,000 calls in the first five days.\n\nMainstream media at times covered church members’ political support for the LDP but in the mid-2000s, it gradually became a social taboo to discuss the topic openly, Suzuki said. In earlier times, media outlets had faced a torrent of calls after critical coverage of the issue, he said.\n\n“After Abe’s death, hearing the words ‘cult’ and ‘Unification Church’ so prevalently now in major media outlets for the past two months still feels unreal and shocking even for me, especially because those words had been taboo for so many years,” he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn September 2021, Abe made his most public appearance at an event hosted by the church through a video message, alongside other prominent politicians who recorded messages.\n\nThat video message may have provoked the suspected gunman, according to police sources quoted in Japanese media. Yamagami’s uncle told the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper that Yamagami had attempted suicide because of his family’s financial difficulties, and that the suspect’s mother was traumatized after her husband killed himself.\n\nYamagami is now detained and undergoing psychiatric evaluations until November, when prosecutors will decide whether to press formal murder charges.\n\nNobuya Fukumoto, a lawyer for the Unification Church, said in a news conference last week that the donations from Yamagami’s mother exceeded $704,000, including funds from a life insurance policy and real estate sales. The lawyer said he believed she made an “excessive donation.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYamagami’s story of grief and financial turmoil has drawn some sympathizers. Thousands have signed a petition advocating for a reduced sentence, and people have donated over $7,000 in cash, clothing, books and other items to Yamagami, according to Japanese news outlet Jiji Press.\n\nHis story is not unique, said Hiroshi Yamaguchi, a lawyer with the National Network of Lawyers Against Spiritual Sales, a Tokyo-based advocacy group. From 1987 to 2021, there were nearly 35,000 cases brought by defendants claiming about $863 million in damages from the Unification Church, according to the advocacy group’s website.\n\n“His mother was mentally in a very difficult situation … and it is typical for people in a situation like her to become victims to the Unification Church,” Yamaguchi said.\n\nYamaguchi wants to see greater regulation of spiritual sales or excessive donations, and proper care of children of parents who are members of “new religion” groups who may be donating heavily to such organizations.\n\n“I really felt that it was a matter of time before something like this happened,” Yamaguchi said. “I have seen countless tragedies and difficulties faced by children of parents who are part of the Unification Church … I can easily imagine that Yamagami must have suffered in a similar manner.”\n\nMarc Fisher in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

    "What Did Japan’s Kishida Do at the UN General Assembly?": "Advertisement\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio’s departure to New York for this year’s U.N. General Assembly was delayed because of Typhoon 14, but once he arrived on Tuesday, September 20, he had a packed schedule.\n\nOn Tuesday, he met with British Prime Minister Liz Truss for the first time. During their meeting, they discussed their shared concerns about China’s potential use of force to change the status quo in the East and South China Seas, the situation in Ukraine, and the joint development of a next-generation fighter jet. Kishida also met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and discussed Ukraine and U.N. reform.\n\nKishida’s first day in New York concluded with a speech to the General Assembly in which he called for reforms of the U.N. Security Council and the abolition of nuclear weapons, criticized Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and raised the issue of Japanese abductees in North Korea.\n\nJapan has been aiming for U.N. reform for almost two decades now. However, in this year’s speech, Kishida tied Russia’s war in Ukraine directly to the need for reform: “We must face the fact that the credibility of the United Nations is at stake due to the aggression against Ukraine by Russia, a permanent member of the Security Council. We, the Member States of the UN, must act to restore this Organization’s credibility.” He continued, “Frequently, debates about the dysfunctionality of the Security Council have been pointed out. We have debated about this issue for almost over 30 years. But what is truly needed now is not a discussion for the sake of discussion, but actions toward reform… The time has come to start text-based negotiations to reform the Security Council.”\n\nDiplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.

They also discussed improving relations, the situation in Yemen and other parts of the Middle East, and Russia’s war in Ukraine. Also on Wednesday, Kishida met with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., and they agreed to cooperate in security, energy, and infrastructure, and discussed shared concerns about China’s growing maritime assertiveness in the East and South China Seas and China’s “economic coercion.”\n\nEnjoying this article?

Security Council in his General Assembly speech. The two leaders agreed to work together on Security Council reform and to strengthen the Japan-U.S. alliance.\n\nThroughout his time in New York, Kishida’s commitment to abolishing nuclear weapons has been consistent. He attended the first meeting of leaders of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) Friends: six like-minded nations that want to pass the CTBT as soon as possible – Japan, Australia, the Netherlands, Canada, Finland, and Germany. Although the Foreign Ministers of the CTBT Friends had met before, this was the first time that a meeting of the leaders of the six nations was held.\n\nDuring his speech the night before, Kishida had used the platform to criticize Russia again, for “threatening the use of nuclear weapons,” and “[blocking] the unity and concerted efforts of the international community to reach consensus on an outcome document that would maintain and strengthen the NPT regime.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe other persistent, tricky issue Kishida tried to deal with while in New York was Japan-South Korea relations. During a meeting on the sidelines of the CTBT meeting, Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol affirmed that Japan and South Korea are “important neighbors under the current strategic environment.” They agreed to improve trilateral cooperation with the United States, and deal with North Korea. Yoon also reiterated support for Japan’s efforts to resolve the abductees issue.\n\nThe Japanese government characterized the talks as “informal,” given that the issue of wartime forced labor is not resolved yet. Both Japan and South Korea are watching the outcome of the lawsuit against Japanese companies filed by wartime Korean laborers very closely.\n\nThe meeting, according to reporting by The Asahi Shimbun, was “awkward.” South Korea had unilaterally announced a meeting on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly before Kishida confirmed, which made Kishida disinclined to attend. However, Kishida attended the meeting after all, believing that the South Koreans were sincere in trying to mend relations. He did not have much to say at the meeting, and Yoon had to do most of the talking so a semblance of a meeting could be maintained.",

    "Deepest scientific ocean drilling effort sheds light on Japan’s next ‘big one’": "Deepest scientific ocean drilling effort sheds light on Japan’s next ‘big one’\n\nScientists who drilled deeper into an undersea earthquake fault than ever before have found that the tectonic stress in Japan’s Nankai subduction zone is less than expected.\n\nThe results of the study led by the University of Washington and the University of Texas at Austin, published Sept. 5 in Geology, are a puzzle, since the fault produces a great earthquake almost every century and was thought to be building for another big one.\n\nAlthough the Nankai fault has been stuck for decades, the findings reveal that it is not yet showing major signs of pent-up tectonic stress. Authors say the result doesn’t alter the long-term outlook for the fault, which last ruptured in 1946, when it caused a tsunami that killed thousands, and is expected to do so again during the next 50 years.\n\nThe findings will help scientists home in on the link between tectonic forces and the earthquake cycle. This could potentially lead to better earthquake forecasts, both at Nankai and other megathrust faults, like the Cascadia subduction zone off the coast of Washington and Oregon.\n\n“Right now, we have no way of knowing if the big one for Cascadia — a magnitude-9 scale earthquake and tsunami — will happen this afternoon or 200 years from now,” said lead author Harold Tobin, a UW professor of Earth and space sciences and co-chief scientist on the drilling expedition. “But I have some optimism that with more and more direct observations like this one from Japan we can start to recognize when something anomalous is occurring and that the risk of an earthquake is heightened in a way that could help people prepare.\n\n“We learn how these faults work by studying them all over the world, and that knowledge will directly translate into insight into the Cascadia hazard as well.”\n\nMegathrust faults such as Nankai and Cascadia, and the tsunamis they generate, are among the most powerful and damaging on the globe. Scientists say they currently have no reliable way of knowing when and where the next big one will hit.\n\nThe hope is that by directly measuring the force felt between tectonic plates pushing on each other — tectonic stress — scientists can learn when a great earthquake is ready to happen.\n\n“This is the heart of the subduction zone, right above where the fault is locked, where the expectation was that the system should be storing energy between earthquakes,” said co-author Demian Saffer at University of Texas at Austin, who also co-led the scientific drilling expedition. “It changes the way we’re thinking about stress in these systems.”\n\nThe nature of tectonics means that the great earthquake faults are found in deep ocean, miles under the seafloor, making them incredibly challenging to measure directly. Tobin and Saffer’s drilling expedition is the closest scientists have come.\n\nTheir record-breaking feat took place in 2018 aboard a Japanese scientific drilling ship, the Chikyu, which drilled almost 2 miles, or just over 3 kilometers, into the tectonic plate before the borehole got too unstable to continue — 1 mile short of the fault.\n\nNevertheless, the researchers gathered invaluable data about subsurface conditions near the fault, including stress. To do that, they measured how much the borehole changed shape as the Earth squeezed it from the sides, then pumped water to see what it took to force its walls back out. That told them the direction and strength of horizontal stress felt by the plate pushing on the fault.\n\nContrary to predictions, the horizontal stress expected to have built up since the most recent great earthquake was close to zero, as if the system had already released its pent-up energy.\n\nThe researchers suggested several explanations: It could be that the fault simply needs less pent-up energy than thought to slip in a big earthquake, or that the stresses are lurking nearer to the fault than the drilling reached. Or it could be that the tectonic push will come suddenly in the coming years. Either way, the researchers said the drilling showed the need for further investigation and long-term monitoring of the fault.\n\n“Findings like this can seem like they muddy the picture, because things aren’t as simple as our theory or models predicted they were,” Tobin said. “But that just means we’re gaining more understanding of how the real world works, and the real world is messy and complicated.”\n\nThe research was funded by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program and the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, or JAMSTEC. Other co-authors are Takehiro Hirose at JAMSTEC and David Castillo at Insight GeoMechanics in Australia.\n\n###\n\nFor more information, contact Tobin at htobin@uw.edu or Saffer at demian@ig.utexas.edu.\n\nAdapted from an article by the University of Texas at Austin.",
    "In search of a new security strategy for Japan": "Authors: Ken Jimbo and Bryan Tan, Keio University\n\nIn the 1970s, Japanese prime minister Masayoshi Ohira developed a concept of ‘comprehensive security’ that emphasised the need to broaden the scope of security to non-military domains. The concept built upon the ideas outlined in the 1969 Nixon Doctrine, where the United States encouraged its allies to take ‘primary responsibility’ for their own defence.\n\nThis prompted Japan to take on a larger role in the US–Japan alliance and in safeguarding its own security. Ohira’s taskforce reinforced Japan’s commitment to the comprehensive security agenda by emphasising Japan’s proactive approach to non-military domains such as economic, food and energy security.\n\nIn 2022, Japan’s security strategy is once again groping towards a comprehensive approach but with greater emphasis on robust military capability, economic statecraft and technological innovation.\n\nAs the security environment surrounding Japan becomes more severe, maintaining a favourable balance of power has become an increasingly difficult task. Tokyo is currently facing challenges on three major strategic fronts. China — the biggest strategic challenge — boasts military capabilities which far outstrip those of Japan. The 2018 National Defense Program Guidelines highlighted that, as maintaining Japan’s maritime and air superiority becomes untenable, the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) will require major reform in terms of defence doctrine, capability and operations. This will necessitate significant increases in the defence budget as well as the adoption of innovative defence concepts.\n\nThe challenge for Japan’s defence reform derives from the need to prepare against two additional fronts: North Korea and Russia. North Korea’s continued development of nuclear and missile technologies signifies the growing risk of conflict escalation. Achieving the denuclearisation of North Korea while preparing for a possible crisis remain the top priorities of Japan’s strategy.\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine also presents new risks for Japan. The Japan–Russia peace treaty negotiations — which have remained unresolved since the end of the Second World War — were suspended indefinitely by Russia in April 2022. Russia will no longer hesitate to pressure Japan’s military and try to pursue deeper strategic alignment with China to challenge US military engagement in Asia.\n\nJapan’s three strategic fronts — China, North Korea and Russia — all require different defence capability and posture requirements. If Tokyo invests in defence for each risk scenario separately, the cost will be enormous and the JSDF will eventually lose the opportunity to implement long-awaited China-focused reform. A comprehensive approach that places a greater emphasis on enhancing Japan’s economic security and the exploration of new domains such as cyber, space and emerging technologies is essential.\n\nA robust increase in Japan’s defence budget must be the starting point for reform. Domestic public support for an increased defence budget was at a historic high during the Upper House election in July 2022. This came on the heels of the Japan–US Security Consultative Committee meetings between the ministers and secretaries for defence and foreign affairs, where Japan ‘reiterated its resolve to fundamentally reinforce its defence capabilities’. This commitment will see Japan look to upgrade its military capabilities to react to higher-end conflicts by ensuring interoperability with its allied forces.\n\nMore controversially, there has also been a push within the Japanese government to obtain counterstrike capabilities. With the introduction of hypersonic missiles, a technology possessed by both China and North Korea, Japan’s current missile defence capability is no longer sufficient. Tokyo has been exploring the possibility of acquiring counterstrike capabilities for the purpose of destroying enemy missile bases in foreign territories, but the scope of this is yet to be finalised.\n\nOn economic statecraft, Japan enacted its Economic Security Promotion Bill (ESPB) in May 2022, focusing on three major areas. The first area prioritises the need to protect sensitive technologies by placing more control on investments from and exports to specific foreign entities, and by ensuring that supply chains that are critical to sensitive high-tech sectors remain secure.\n\nAdditionally, the ESPB aims to ensure that Japan continues to work towards strategic indispensability. By increasing the funding for companies and institutions that conduct research and development (R&D) into key existing and new technologies, Tokyo can reinvigorate an area in which it has long lagged behind other countries. This will allow Japan to have a bigger security presence in the region and cease relying solely on military capability. And that should open up more opportunities for Japan to export defence equipment to friendly states, which will elevate Japan’s interoperability with other parts of the world.\n\nInvesting in technological development will also improve Japan’s economic security. Cutting-edge core technologies — such as robotics, artificial intelligence and quantum computing — will raise industrial competition within the private sector. At the same time, these dual use technologies can also be used in the development of military applications.\n\nJapan’s R&D in defence technologies has not been terribly active compared with other countries. In the 2021–22 financial year, the Japanese Ministry of Defense requested a budget of 325.7 billion yen (US$2.5 billion) for R&D costs to strengthen defence technologies and their practical implementation. Increasing the defence budget will encourage long-term innovation, but there is still a long way to go to overcome public hesitation towards investing in military R&D.\n\nThe concerns faced by prime minister Ohira in the 1970s remain relevant today. Japan must double down on its efforts to achieve strategic autonomy and indispensability. Strengthening Japan’s military capabilities and investing in defence technology is a step in the right direction, but the pace leaves much to be desired.\n\nKen Jimbo is President of the Asia Pacific Initiative and Professor at the Faculty of Policy Management, Keio University.\n\nBryan Tan is Student Assistant at the Faculty of Policy Management, Keio University.\n\nThis article appears in the most recent edition of East Asia Forum Quarterly, ‘Japan’s strategic choices’, Vol 14, No 3.",

It was 2017 and the Australian chairman of Macquarie Capital Asia had just landed a deal to operate a toll road in Gwangju, southern Korea. The toll booths had been staffed by a company filled with former South Korean secret service members who had spent their careers running clandestine missions into North Korea. After five years of operating the toll booths at an above-market rate, Macquarie said it wanted to tender the contract out. “They said they should just be able to keep it and keep charging whatever they wanted to charge. In the interests of our investors in the fund that owned that asset we had to say no,” says Walker. “We miscalculated.” “Within weeks we had all these former scary people surrounding our building and carrying a coffin with my name on it.” South Korea boasts a robust democracy: Financial Industry Union members stage a rally against the government’s labor policy this month. Credit:AP It was not Walker’s only experience of what he calls Korea’s form of “robust direct democracy”, where small protests disrupt traffic in Seoul most weekends and corporate leaders have to tread wearily around social justice campaigns. A year later Macquarie wanted to restructure one of its investments in a Korean waste business. There was a disabled association that was responsible for part of the processing that would lose out. “‘Go home foreign devil signs’ started appearing everywhere,” says Walker.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the past 40 years, South Korea has gone from an autocratic dictatorship to vibrant democracy. Despite a history of protest and protectionism, the economy is now deregulating fast and spreading South Korean technical and cultural innovations around the world. It is on track to overtake Japan in gross domestic product per capita by 2028 – meaning the average Korean worker will be more productive and wealthier than their Japanese counterparts - a neighbour with whom it shares a brutal history of war and colonisation. Shin Hae-kang, an 80-year-old former construction manager, says the changes he has seen over his lifetime have been “unimaginable”. On the banks of the Han, the river that pierces central Seoul, he recalls the legacy of Japanese occupation between 1910 and 1945 and the Republic’s struggles after the Korean War that divided the North from the South. Shin Hae-kang, 80, a retired construction company manager Credit:Eryk Bagshaw “There were no dams, no bridges, no high-end buildings, nothing but rubbish, mountains, and ferries,” he says. “They were all farm lands here and there. The only habitable areas were near the palace. Other places had nearly zero habitable infrastructures. All these apartment complexes weren’t here 40 to 50 years ago.” Now, the golden skyscraper of Hanwa – a Korean arms manufacturer – towers over the river bank. So do the headquarters of South Korea’s technology titans Samsung, LG and Hyundai, the family-founded dynasties known locally as chaebols. “When I got here in [the 1990s] Korea was still in the perspiration stage. Hard-working, focused on manufacturing and testing new and different things in the market,” says Walker, who is the deputy chairman of the Australia Korea Business Council.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Then in the early 2000s, they started moving from perspiration to aspiration. That’s the point at which people like LG and Samsung, started hiring foreigners, for example. They became much more outward-looking far less focused on manufacturing much more focused on technology, and services. And then by 2010, you know, post-financial crisis. I call that the start of the transformation era.” “Now, I think the Koreans see the domestic market more as a testbed than the ultimate market. They have been prepared to be much tougher around the restructuring of their domestic businesses. They don’t throw lifelines to businesses that are going under. There is also mobility across the chaebol now, where you have groups like Hyundai, god forbid, hiring people from Samsung.” John Walker, from the Australia Korea Business Council, has witnessed South Korea turn to global markets during his time in the country. Credit:Christopher Pearce Japan, which dominated the 1990s and rose to become the second-largest economy in the world on the back of the technological prowess of Sony and Panasonic, has struggled to innovate since. Its own market was so strong that the international market was an afterthought. When global competition from America, China and South Korea emerged, it stumbled and held on tight to the technology that had delivered its glory days. Taro Kono, Japan’s digital minister, has declared a war on fax machines and floppy disks, devices that still dominate parts of Japan’s bureaucracy two decades after they became obsolete. But he has faced resistance from some parts of Japan’s government and corporate sectors that warned abolishing fax machines – still used widely in the legal, and business communities – would be “impossible” and that floppy disks were more reliable and secure than digital transfers or emails. “We really need to improve convenience in people’s lives,” Kono said. Kono knows convenience drives productivity. The longer Japanese workers have to spend printing faxing and putting a stamp on a document, rather than just emailing, the less time they have to innovate. By 2028 these incremental hurdles, combined with an innovation gap and an ageing population are on track to crush Japan’s economic competitiveness leaving it behind neighbours South Korea and Taiwan. The Japan Centre for Economic Research found that the inflation-adjusted GDP per capita will reach $US46,443 in Japan in 2028 compared to $US 46,519 in Korea.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The biggest obstacle for Japan’s economic growth is its low birthrate and ageing population,” said the centre’s principal economist Atsushi Tomiyama. “But South Korea and Taiwan are in much the same case on that point, so the difference comes from their productivity and efforts for digitalisation.” Inside Akihabara Radio Centre in central Tokyo, Shinya Sato admires the Sony Walkmans, CD players, ill-fated mini discs and other 90s nostalgia for Japan’s technical glory that plaster the walls. Sato has worked in Japan’s oldest electronic hub in the centre of Akihabara – Tokyo’s billboard emblazoned electric city – for the past 20 years. Shinya Sato has worked in the Akihabara Radio Centre in Tokyo for 20 years. Credit:Viola Kam “It’s been amazing to see the transition from analogue to digital, but Japan is struggling a bit now. It’s difficult. It is not innovating as much as it used to,” he says. “The Japanese were better at building things that move, like tapes and mini-discs and CDs. But digital data, memory, chips, and programming – the Japanese are not as strong. Now the Chinese and South Koreans have developed better technology.” China’s COVID-zero policy, its flirtation with economic decoupling from the West and its growing geopolitical tensions have presented an opportunity for Japan and South Korea, but South Korea has been faster at reacting to the gap in the market says the managing director of Pilbara Minerals Ken Brinsden. ”They are the next big move beyond China,” says Brinsden who mines lithium in Portland, WA – a key ingredient in electric vehicle batteries. “Japan has been kind of a poster child if you like for some of the [electric car] developments. But it’s relatively narrow the extent to which broadly speaking that the Japanese have built on the lithium-ion battery platform [for its cars]. In contrast, Korea has much more, I think it’s fair to say, a much more international perspective.“\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSouth Korea’s Foreign Minister Park Jin told the Jeju Forum this month that Korea was now aiming to become a “global pivotal state”. “In short, Korea is now taking a leap towards joining the ranks of G7 [the world’s largest seven economies]. The GPS vision we embrace will expand and advance our diplomacy in accordance with the stature of the Republic of Korea today.” It is a rhetorical shift away from Seoul’s history of more cautious diplomacy in the shadow of the United States, China and the existential threat of the nuclear-armed North. In a sign it is already attempting to play a bigger role in global affairs, South Korea’s President Yoon Suk-yeol met with Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in New York on Thursday – the first time the leaders of the two countries had met since 2019 after years of disputes over Japanese war crimes But not all of its young graduates are on board with Korea’s new agenda.

    "Japan’s $2-billion initiative to prep pandemic vaccines in 100 days": "A new centre will invest in shots for a range of infectious diseases so the country is ready for future outbreaks.\n\nA new Japanese research effort will work on vaccines for infectious diseases, including coronaviruses, monkeypox and dengue virus.Credit: Eugene Hoshiko/AP/Shutterstock\n\nAfter recognizing that Japan was slow to develop vaccines for COVID-19, the government has pledged to invest US$2 billion in a vaccine-research initiative to ensure that the country is ready to respond promptly to future epidemics.\n\nThe Strategic Center of Biomedical Advanced Vaccine Research and Development for Preparedness and Response (SCARDA) will initially invest in vaccine research for eight pathogens, including coronaviruses, monkeypox, dengue virus and Zika virus, using a range of technologies for vaccine delivery, such as mRNA technology, viral vectors and recombinant proteins.\n\nJapan has been “too slow to catch up” with the rest of the world in making COVID-19 vaccines, says Ken Ishii, a University of Tokyo vaccinologist who is also part of the central research centre selected by SCARDA. The country’s three most advanced COVID-19 vaccine candidates are still in late-stage clinical trials and none is approved for use.\n\nIn recognition of this delay, the Japanese government established SCARDA in March; the centre will launch formally in November, says Ishii. The government has realized that developing vaccines is complicated and takes resources, and has given the field a boost, says Toshihiro Horii, a vaccinologist at Osaka University. “That is a tremendously huge amount of money,” he says.\n\nThe initiative will bring together researchers from across Japan, says Yoshihiro Kawaoka, a virologist at the University of Tokyo, and head of the SCARDA central research centre. “That is unique, at least for Japan.”\n\nHundred-day goal\n\nSCARDA’s aim will be to produce diagnostic tests, treatments and vaccines ready for large-scale production within the first 100 days of a pathogen with pandemic potential being identified. This 100-day mission was first proposed by the United Kingdom in 2021, and backed by the other countries in the G7 group of wealthy nations. Similar initiatives include the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Agency (BARDA); this coordinates the development of vaccines, drugs and diagnostics in response to public-health emergencies, including pandemics, and invested in several COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n“Since SCARDA is a new organization, it has much to learn from BARDA” and other initiatives funding vaccines, such as the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, says Michinari Hamaguchi, director-general of SCARDA.\n\nTwo of SCARDA’s first approved projects aim to develop universal coronavirus vaccines and vaccines against a group of coronaviruses related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), such as SARS-CoV-2. Another project will create a fast-track system for evaluating vaccine candidates.\n\nJapan’s centre will operate with around 30 members of staff and funding to last 5 years. Of the allotted $2 billion, $1.2 billion will go to vaccine research and development projects, and $400 million will be used to support start-ups in drug development. Another $400 million will be spent on setting up a virtual network of centres of excellence for basic research in vaccine science, and testing vaccine candidates in early-stage trials. The goal is “to find seeds for future vaccines”, says Kawaoka.\n\nIn addition to the central research centre based in Tokyo, there will be four core institutes — Osaka University, Nagasaki University, Hokkaido University and Chiba University. Another five institutions will provide support services such as animal models.\n\nHorii, who leads several clinical trials for malaria and is not involved with SCARDA, says that the current bottleneck in vaccine development in Japan is the translation of research into clinical practice. SCARDA will have to move beyond basic science to develop expertise in taking vaccine candidates through clinical trials, he says. “We have many vaccinologists in Japan, but the majority of them are basic researchers.”",
    "Japan to Suspend Myanmar Military Training Program": "Click to expand Image Officers march during a parade to commemorate Myanmar's 77th Armed Forces Day in Naypyitaw, Myanmar, March 27, 2022. © 2022 AP Photo/Aung Shine Oo\n\nOn Tuesday, September 20, Japan’s Defense Ministry announced that as of 2023 it would no longer accept new military personnel from the Myanmar military for training in Japan. The ministry cited the junta’s execution of four pro-democracy activists in July as a major factor in its decision.\n\n“We decided it’s not appropriate to continue the military cooperation and exchange in its current form,” said Takeshi Aoki, a spokesperson for the Defense Ministry. However, two officers and nine cadets who are currently receiving training at Japan’s National Defense Academy and Japan Self-Defense Forces facilities will remain until their programs finish.\n\nSince 2015, Japan has accepted cadets and officers from Myanmar under article 100-2 of the Self-Defense Forces Act, which permits training and educating foreign nationals in Defense Ministry facilities with the defense minister’s approval. Following Myanmar military’s coup in February 2021, Japan accepted two officers and two cadets in 2021 and another two officers and two cadets in 2022.\n\nIn May, Human Rights Watch and Justice For Myanmar located Myanmar Air Force Lt. Col. Hlwan Moe, who received training at Japan’s Air Command and Staff College from August 2016 to March 2017, at Magway Air Base in Myanmar’s central Magway Region. Military units deployed at the air base have been implicated in serious abuses, including possible indiscriminate airstrikes in Magway. In August, Human Rights Watch found that Myanmar Army Brig. Gen. Tin Soe, who received training at Japan’s Ground Self Defense Force Staff College from August 2016 to March 2017, was based at Eastern Command headquarters from August 2021 to July 2022. Eastern Command oversees operations in southern Shan and Karenni (Kayah) States and its forces were responsible for a massacre of civilians and other atrocities.\n\nThe Defense Ministry’s decision to suspend the training program is critical to ensuring that Japan does not risk becoming complicit in Myanmar military abuses. It is a small and long overdue step, but one that should embolden the Japanese government to join with other democracies that are taking stronger action against the junta. Japan should publicly voice its support for the draft Myanmar resolution that Britain circulated at the United Nations Security Council. That resolution reportedly calls for a global arms embargo on Myanmar that would prohibit all military training and imposes sanctions on the junta.",
    "Japan’s Big Tourism Reopening": "Good morning from Skift. It’s Friday, September 23. Here’s what you need to know about the business of travel today.\n\nListen Now\n\nApple Podcasts | Spotify | Overcast | Google Podcasts\n\nEpisode Notes\n\nTravel industry leaders gathered this week at Skift Global Forum in New York City to discuss significant topics and major trends in travel, and amid all the notable soundbites, Corporate Travel Editor Matthew Parsons reports on three big takeaways from this year’s event.\n\nOne of the takeaways Parsons cites came from Frederic Lalonde, the CEO of online travel agency Hopper. Lalonde said the key to building new products is being bold and experimenting, even if that means generating a loss. He said all of Hopper’s new products lose money but added the company is constantly trying to figure out what might work. Lalonde admitted he was stunned by Hopper’s success in selling loot boxes — treasure chests with a mystery gift — as part of a Puerto Rico promotion.\n\nAnother major takeaway from the forum was the call for tourism marketers to sell true images of destinations. Kenyan author and conservationist Dr. Mordecai Ogada blasted the travel industry for selling images of Africa from hundreds of years ago — themes he said are mostly based on Tarzan. Parsons also listed the importance of executives being approachable for all staff members as a major takeaway. Josh D’Amaro, chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products, said interacting with employees as much as possible is crucial in building trust with staff.\n\nWe turn next to major news from Japan. The country announced on Thursday it’s restoring visa-free entry for independent travelers from October 11, reports Asia Editor Peden Doma Bhutia.\n\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida also said that Japan would lift the daily cap on arrivals on the same date. Those moves put an end to the two-and-a-half years of strict travel restrictions that severely limited the number of international travelers to Japan. However, foreign tourists would need to be fully vaccinated or test negative for Covid prior to arrival.\n\nAt the same time as the restrictions lift, the Japanese government will bring back its nationwide travel discount program to boost domestic tourism. The program was paused after a surge in Covid cases.\n\nFinally, hospitality company Ennismore is planning to expand its co-working spaces it calls “Working From” to all of its 14 hotel brands, reports Corporate Travel Editor Parsons in this Week’s Future of Work briefing.\n\nThe group’s Hoxton properties in London and Chicago are currently its only hotels to operate the co-working spaces. But founder and co-CEO Sharan Pasricha said at Skift Global Forum this week that Ennismore would expand Working From to other Ennismore hotels, which include Hyde and Mama Shelter. Pasricha described Working From, which he founded in 2019, as a “boomerang success,” citing the waiting list of 400 people wanting to join its London co-working space.",
    "Japan: Submission to the UN Human Rights Committee": "This submission aims to contribute to the Human Rights Committee’s (“the Committee”) upcoming review of Japan’s compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR or “the Covenant”). It focuses on the abuse of children’s rights by education technologies (EdTech) endorsed by the Japanese government for online learning during the Covid-19 pandemic, discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, the transgender legal recognition process, the death penalty and criminal justice, and child abuse in sport. It is submitted to the Human Rights Committee in advance of its review of Japan at the Committee’s 136th session.\n\nChildren’s Rights Abuses by Government-Endorsed Online Learning during the Covid-19 Pandemic (articles 17, 18, and 19)\n\nIn a global investigation of education technology (EdTech) products endorsed by the world’s most populous countries for children’s education during the Covid-19 pandemic, Human Rights Watch found that the Japanese government violated children’s right to privacy and other rights.[1]\n\nOf the EdTech products that were recommended by Japan’s Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT) on March 2, 2020, Human Rights Watch randomly selected for analysis ten EdTech products that would serve as an illustrative sample of MEXT’s decisions.[2] These were Asahi Shimbun, Cisco Webex, eboard, Flying ClassRoom, Happy Lilac, LINE, NHK for School, schoolTakt, Study Sapuri, and Z-Kai.[3] Of these ten products, two were mobile applications (“apps”), six were websites, and two were available in both formats.\n\nOur analysis found that nine out of ten of these EdTech products surveilled or had the capacity to surveil children online, outside school hours, and deep into their private lives. Built by private companies, these EdTech products installed invasive tracking technologies on children’s devices that harvested data on who children are, where children are, who their family and friends are, and what kind of device their family could afford for them to use.\n\nHuman Rights Watch also found that seven of these EdTech products transmitted children’s personal data to advertising technology (AdTech) companies, and two products had the capability to do so.\n\nFinding Out Who Children Are\n\nThree EdTech products authorized by MEXT for children’s use had the capability to collect their users’ Android Advertising IDs, allowing them to tag, collectively, an estimated 1.5 million users and uniquely identify their devices for the sole purpose of advertising to them.[4] Another two EdTech products digitally fingerprinted children using invasive techniques that were impossible to avoid or protect against without throwing the device away.[5]\n\nThese identifiers enabled companies to infer the interests and characteristics of individual children for commercial purposes. Every time a child connects to the internet and comes into contact with tracking technology, any information collected about that child is tied back to the identifier associated with them by that company, resulting in a comprehensive profile over time. Data tied together in this way do not need a real name to be able to target a real child or person.\n\nNeither the government nor these five EdTech companies disclosed their use of these tracking techniques. Human Rights Watch finds that these tracking techniques are neither proportionate nor necessary for these products to function, or to deliver educational content to children. Their use on children in an educational setting arbitrarily interferes with children’s right to privacy.\n\nTracking Where Children Are\n\nInformation about a child’s physical location also reveals powerfully intimate details about their life far beyond their coordinates. Once collected, these data points can reveal sensitive information such as where a child lives and where they go to school; even without names or other obviously identifiable information, it is startlingly easy to identify real children and people without their awareness and consent.\n\nHuman Rights Watch found that two apps recommended by MEXT for children’s learning had the ability to collect precise location data, or GPS coordinates, that can identify a user’s exact location to within 4.9 meters.[6] Both apps also had the ability to collect the time of the device’s current location, as well as the last known location of the device—revealing exactly where a user is, where they were before that, and how long they stayed at each place.\n\nAt a time when many children were remotely learning from home under Covid-19 lockdowns, the surveillance of their physical presence through location data likely revealed addresses and places most significant to them.\n\nTracking Who Children Know\n\nTwo apps recommended by MEXT for children’s use had the ability to collect information about their users’ friends, family, and other acquaintances by accessing the contacts list saved on users’ phones.[7] This allowed these apps to learn personal details about these contacts, including any saved names, phone numbers, emails, addresses, relationships, and profile photos. Human Rights Watch found that this data was neither necessary for these apps to function, nor provided educational benefit to children.\n\nWhen details about the personal relationships of a child are collected without consent or awareness by the child or by the family member or friend in question, it is an arbitrary intrusion on the privacy of each of these individuals. For contacts, the right to privacy is affected by the “mere collection of personal data” in which they lose control over information, in addition to the risk of experiencing potential misuse of their personal data.[8]\n\nTracking What Children Do Inside and Outside the Classroom\n\nAd trackers and third-party cookies are generally used by AdTech companies to scrutinize a person’s every action and behavior, infer their characteristics and interests, and deliver customized ads and content that follow them around the internet.\n\nChildren in Japan were tracked at dizzying scale. Of the eight government-authorized EdTech websites reviewed by Human Rights Watch, seven collectively installed 120 ad trackers on children’s devices and browsers. These ad trackers identified and collected information about what children do within their virtual classrooms and sent their data to AdTech companies.\n\nFive websites collectively inserted 117 third-party cookies on children’s personal devices. These cookies followed children after they left these websites and across the internet, outside of school hours, and sent their whereabouts and activities to AdTech companies.\n\nNotably, Z-kai, an EdTech website endorsed by MEXT for all elementary, middle, and high school students in Japan to learn core subjects during Covid-19 school closures, deployed the highest number of ad trackers and third-party cookies among all the EdTech websites analyzed by Human Rights Watch in its global investigation. Within milliseconds of a child opening up Z-kai, 54 ad trackers and 76 third-party cookies began tracking the child’s behavior and transmitting this data to AdTech companies around the world.\n\nThis unnecessary, disproportionate data surveillance—the highest of any country reviewed by Human Rights Watch—enabled advertisers and other companies to use children’s data for commercial purposes, and exposed children to further risk of misuse and exploitation of their data. Their use on children in an educational setting unreasonably infringes upon children’s right to privacy.\n\nGovernment Failure to Protect\n\nNine out of the ten government-authorized EdTech products reviewed by Human Rights Watch engaged in data practices that unreasonably infringed on children’s rights or risked doing so. These nine products also sent or granted access to children’s personal data to AdTech companies that specialize in behavioral advertising or whose algorithms determine what children see online. In doing so, these companies not only distorted or risked distorting children’s online experiences, but also risked influencing their opinions and beliefs at a time in their lives when they are at high risk of manipulative interference.[9]\n\nThese nine EdTech products were marketed as free and provided to the Japanese government at no direct financial cost. In the process of endorsing these and promoting their wide adoption by schools, teachers, and students, MEXT offloaded the true costs of providing education online onto children, who were forced to pay for their learning with their rights to privacy, access to information, and freedom of thought.\n\nHuman Rights Watch did not find evidence that MEXT took measures to prevent or mitigate children’s rights abuses by companies, or that MEXT checked whether the EdTech products they were rapidly endorsing were safe for children to use. As a result, children whose families were able to afford access to the internet and connected devices, or who made hard sacrifices in order to do so, were exposed to the privacy practices of the EdTech products they were told or required to use during Covid-19 school closures.\n\nChildren, parents, and teachers were largely kept in the dark about these data surveillance practices. Neither the government, nor the nine EdTech companies, informed children and their parents of the data practices that risked or infringed on children’s rights. As these tracking technologies were invisible to the user, children had no reasonably practical way of knowing the existence and extent of these data practices, much less the impacts on their rights. By withholding critical information, the government and these companies impeded children’s access to justice and remedy.\n\nEven if children, parents, and teachers had known about these data practices, Human Rights Watch found that the data surveillance took place in virtual classrooms and educational settings where children could not reasonably object to such surveillance. These EdTech companies did not allow students to decline to be tracked; this monitoring happened secretly, without the child’s knowledge or consent. In most instances, it was impossible for children to opt out of such surveillance and data collection without opting out of compulsory education and giving up on formal learning during the pandemic.\n\nNHK for School\n\nNotably, NHK for School, developed by the public broadcaster, was the only one of the ten EdTech websites and apps endorsed by the government that protected their child users’ privacy by not installing any tracking technologies.[10] This demonstrates that it is possible for the Japanese government to uphold the obligations to protect and promote children’s rights by building and offering digital educational services to children that do not compromise their data and their privacy, and not resort to endorsing products that do violate these rights.\n\nHuman Rights Watch recommends that the Committee ask the government of Japan:\n\nDoes the government have plans to develop and enforce comprehensive child data protection laws?\n\nWhat recourse or remedy does the government provide, or is planning to provide, to children who have experienced infringements of their rights as a result of their use of these EdTech products and whose data remain at risk of misuse and exploitation?\n\nHuman Rights Watch recommends that the Committee call on the government of Japan to:\n\nAdopt child-specific data protection laws that address the significant child rights impacts of the collection, processing, and use of children’s personal data. Where child data protection laws already exist, update and strengthen implementation to deliver a comprehensive child data protection framework that protects the best interests of the child in complex online environments, and ensures that companies respect children’s rights and are held accountable if they fail to do so.\n\nProvide remedy for children whose data were collected through their use of EdTech products. To do so: Conduct a data privacy audit of all EdTech websites and apps it has endorsed for children’s online learning. If the products fail this audit, rescind endorsement of these products, and immediately notify and guide affected schools, teachers, parents, and children to prevent further collection and misuse of children’s data. Require EdTech companies with failed data privacy audits to delete any children’s data collected during the pandemic. Require AdTech companies to identify and immediately delete any children’s data they received from EdTech companies during the pandemic.\n\nEnsure that any services that are endorsed or procured to deliver online education are safe for children. In coordination with data protection authorities and other relevant institutions: Require all companies providing educational services to children to identify, prevent, and mitigate negative impacts on children’s rights, including across their business relationships and global operations. Require child data protection impact assessments of any educational technology provider seeking public investment, procurement, or endorsement. Ensure that public and private educational institutions enter into written contracts with EdTech providers that include protections for children’s data. Define and provide special protections for categories of sensitive personal data that should never be collected from children in educational settings, such as precise geolocation data.\n\n\n\nDiscrimination Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (articles 2, 26)\n\nJapan has no national law prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Some municipal governments have such local laws. In October 2018, the Tokyo Municipal Government (TMG) passed an LGBT non-discrimination law, which requires the TMG and encourages private organizations such as companies, schools, and private groups to act to address discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. In doing so, it became the first prefectural level non-discrimination law regarding sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nIn response to the national laws passed in May 2019 on workplace harassment, three ministries—the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare; the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications; and the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology—issued ministerial regulations and formal notices requiring for the first time that corporations, local governments, and schools take actions to prevent harassment based on sexual orientation or gender identity, including the public outing of a person as LGBT.[11]\n\nLGBT groups in Japan launched a campaign for a national non-discrimination law in the lead-up to the rescheduled Tokyo 2020 Olympics in 2021.[12] In January 2021, 116 Japanese and international groups sent a joint letter urging passage of such legislation to Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga.[13] In March 2021, the groups submitted a petition with 106,250 signatures from Japan and abroad to all Japanese political parties, including the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP),[14] calling for the introduction of the Equality Act in the Diet.[15] Since then, over 40 corporations and other organizations from Japan and overseas have also endorsed the Equality Act.[16]\n\nIn response, the LDP announced that it would enact an LGBT law during the 2021 regular Diet session.[17] But the bill presented at the LDP’s Special Mission Committee on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in April 2021 included no nondiscrimination protections and would only have required the government to “promote understanding of LGBT people.”[18]\n\nIn May 2021, leaders from the LDP and opposition parties agreed on a draft bill in which discrimination against LGBT individuals would be deemed unacceptable. While the parliamentary caucuses of all other political parties approved the proposed bill, the LDP parliamentary representatives failed to approve it. According to media reports, many LDP representatives opposed the bill.[19]\n\nDespite widespread national support and strong global pressure to pass such a law before the rescheduled 2020 Games, Japan failed to pass a national non-discrimination law at the end of the Diet session in June 2021.[20]\n\nHuman Rights Watch recommends that the Committee ask the government of Japan:\n\nWhat steps is the government taking to protect sexual and gender minorities against discrimination?\n\nDoes the government have plans to enact legislation to protect against discrimination nationally in line with its international human rights obligations? If so, on what timeline?\n\nHuman Rights Watch recommends that the Committee call on the government of Japan to:\n\nPass a national non-discrimination law, specifying protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nTransgender Legal Recognition Process (articles 3, 16, 17, 23(2), and 26)\n\nHuman Rights Watch has documented the persistent and discriminatory barriers transgender people face to change their legally recognized gender under the Gender Identity Disorder (GID) Special Cases Act. Current processes to legally change one’s gender infringe on equal civil and political rights for all (article 3), the right to recognition for everyone before the law (article 16), the right to one’s privacy and family (article 17), the right of people of marriageable age to marry and to start a family (article 23(2)), and protection of the law of all persons without discrimination on any ground, including sex (article 26).\n\nThe current law has five requirements for a transgender person to be legally recognized according to their gender identity. They must be at least 18 years old, unmarried, not have any children under age 18, not have gonads or permanently lack functioning gonads, and have a physical form that is “endowed with genitalia that closely resemble the physical form of an alternative gender.” The procedure for changing one’s legally recognized gender requires sterilization surgery and a psychiatric diagnosis, which rests on an outdated and pejorative notion that a transgender identity is a “mental disorder.”\n\nWhile some trans people in Japan are willing to undergo the medical procedures listed in the law, many do not, and should not be required to do so. Further, the continuance of these medical requirements underpins extensive prejudice against trans people.\n\nGender non-conforming children lack access to legal recognition and suffer abuses as a result, such as in education settings. In the context of Japan’s education system, the state’s failure to accord legal recognition of transgender children’s gender identity contributes to discrimination and degrading treatment. Japan should recognize that it may be in the best interests of many transgender children to change their legal gender before they reach age 18.\n\nJapan’s requirement that all applicants for legal gender recognition be unmarried is effectively a mandatory divorce requirement for married transgender people who wish to be recognized. This is because Japan does not recognize same-sex marriages, which a gender transition would create.\n\nThe requirement that a transgender person not have any children under the age of 18 if they wish to secure legal recognition of their gender identity violates transgender people’s right to privacy and family life and the right to found a family, and discriminates on those grounds.\n\nThe surgery requirements force transgender people who want legal recognition to undergo lengthy, expensive, invasive, and irreversible medical procedures. It forces many would-be applicants—including those who would not otherwise choose to take these steps—to undergo physically transformative surgical interventions and undergo sterilization.\n\nIn a 2019 report documenting the barriers to legal gender recognition, Human Rights Watch interviewed 48 transgender people, as well as lawyers, health providers, and academics from 14 prefectures in Japan.[21] Some of the transgender people Human Rights Watch interviewed told us that they would not have chosen sterilization if they had had the option to have their gender legally recognized without doing so. Transgender people told Human Rights Watch that Japan’s law infringes on their rights. One transgender man said: “I don’t want to [have surgery], to be honest. However, I have to just because it is a requirement … I feel pressured to be operated on – so terrible.”[22]\n\nOver time, an increasing number of trans people in Japan have taken the legally prescribed steps and changed their legal gender. In 2020, 676 people were approved for legal gender change, making it a total of 10,301 people who have received the approval during the 16 years since the law came into force.[23] However, activists have said the law limits the number of people who are willing to undergo the full suite of medical interventions.[24]\n\nIn 2017, during its Universal Periodic Review at the United Nations Human Rights Council, Japan pledged to revise the law.[25] But despite mounting domestic and international pressure, the government has failed to do so. In 2019 and 2021, Japan’s Supreme Court upheld lower court rulings that the law did not violate Japan’s constitution.[26] However, in the 2019 ruling, two of the justices recognized the need for reform.[27] “The suffering that [transgender people] face in terms of gender is also of concern to society that is supposed to embrace diversity in gender identity,” they wrote.\n\nHuman Rights Watch recommends that the Committee ask the government of Japan:\n\nDoes the government have plans to end the abusive and discriminatory requirements that serve as barriers for transgender people to have their gender legally recognized? If so, on what timeline?\n\nWhat steps is the government taking to ensure protection against discrimination for transgender people who cannot legally change their gender due to existing barriers?\n\nHuman Rights Watch recommends that the Committee call on the government of Japan to:\n\nIntroduce legislation to amend the Gender Identity Disorder (GID) Special Cases Act, removing the five criteria for changing legal gender, and replacing them with a self-declaration model that respects the rights of transgender individuals.\n\nEnsure that legal recognition of transgender people’s gender identity applies to all aspects of their lives.\n\nRecognize that it may be in the best interests of some transgender children to change their legal gender before the age of majority (age 18) and ensure that transgender children are not excluded from the possibility of applying for legal recognition of their gender identity.\n\nDeath Penalty and Criminal Justice (articles 6, 9, and 14)\n\nJapan executed one person on death row in July 2022.[28] Previously, Japan executed three people on death row in December 2021. In July 2022, there were 106 people on death row.[29] Anti-death penalty advocates have long raised concerns about death row inmates having inadequate access to legal counsel, being notified of their execution only on the day it takes place, and some being executed after their lawyers filed a request for retrial, among other issues.[30] In November 2019, two prisoners on death row sued the government, seeking compensation for the “extremely inhumane” same-day notices and executions.[31]\n\nHuman Rights Watch opposes the infliction of capital punishment in all circumstances because of its inherent cruelty.\n\nJapan’s long overlooked “hostage” justice system, in which criminal suspects are held for long periods in harsh conditions to coerce a confession, received renewed attention after the high-profile arrest of former Renault and Nissan head Carlos Ghosn in November 2018. While Ghosn was detained for 108 days for financial misconduct allegations, he was granted bail quickly compared to other equivalent cases, apparently due to the international criticism. In December 2019, Ghosn fled Japan while on bail.[32] Ghosn’s defenders had alleged before his flight that the Japanese system abused his rights by using long pretrial detention and denial of bail to pressure him to confess, among other issues.[33]\n\nIn June 2019, a 2016 law came into force that requires video and audio recording of interrogations in a small segment of criminal cases, such as serious cases to be tried by the lay judge system. However, Japanese criminal procedure law continues to allow suspects to be detained for up to 23 days prior to prosecution without the possibility of release on bail and for investigators to deny legal counsel from being present during interrogations.\n\nInterviews by Human Rights Watch conducted in 2020 show that many victims of the “hostage” justice system have suffered greatly.[34] For example, in Tokyo, a tax accountant with cancer was charged with a bankruptcy law violation. His family told Human Rights Watch that his health worsened in custody as the jail authorities refused to give him the medication prescribed by his doctor or allow the doctor to assess his health. He was kept in custody for 156 days, during which his bail request on medical grounds was rejected at least seven times. The man kept a meticulous diary of the worsening of his medical condition. He died of cancer waiting for the decision on his appeal.\n\nHuman Rights Watch recommends that the Committee ask the government of Japan:\n\nWhat steps has the government taken to respect the rights of detainees on death row, including their right to adequate legal counsel?\n\nWhy does the government provide little to no advance notice of execution for detainees on death row, and is the government open to changing this practice?\n\nWhat steps has the government taken to respect the rights of detainees, including their right to medical treatment?\n\nWhat plans does the government have to review criminal justice procedures and implement reforms, and on what timeline?\n\nWhat steps has the government taken, and what plans does the government have, to make sure that detainees are not pressured to confess to be released and that lawyers can be present during interrogations?\n\nHuman Rights Watch recommends that the Committee call on the government of Japan to:\n\nEnd the use of capital punishment in all circumstances.\n\nUntil capital punishment is abolished, ensure detainees on death row have access to adequate legal counsel and advanced notice of their execution date.\n\nCommit to reforming the criminal justice system in a human-rights respecting manner, including by limiting the period detainees are held in pretrial detention, allowing for the possibility of release on bail as soon as they are detained, and making sure that investigators allow legal counsel to be present during interrogations and that detainees are not pressured to confess to get released.\n\nEnsure rights of detainees are respected, including their right to access medical treatment.\n\nChild Abuse in Sport (article 7)\n\nA 2020 Human Rights Watch report documented Japan’s history of corporal punishment in sport—known as taibatsu in Japanese—and finds child abuse in sports training throughout Japanese schools, federations, and elite sports.[35] Human Rights Watch documented experiences of more than 800 former child athletes—more than 50 from in-person interviews, and 757 from an online survey—including Olympians and Paralympians. The survey had participants from 45 of the 47 Japanese prefectures, and 50 sports.\n\nHuman Rights Watch found that Japanese athletes from at least 50 different sports reported abuses that included being punched in the face, kicked, beaten with objects like bats or bamboo kendo sticks, being deprived of water, choked, whipped with whistles or racquets, and being sexually abused and harassed. Based on the children we interviewed, and media reports we reviewed, Human Rights Watch documented the results of abuse, including depression, suicide, physical disabilities, and lifelong trauma. One athlete Human Rights Watch interviewed said: “I was hit so many times, I can’t count ... we were all called to the coach and I was hit in the face in front of everyone. I was bleeding, but he did not stop hitting me. I did say that my nose was bleeding, but he did not stop.”[36]\n\nPublic outrage led to important reforms in 2013, such as setting up hotlines to report abuse. However, Human Rights Watch found that these reforms are optional “guidelines” instead of rules, that progress has been uneven and unmonitored, and that there is no mandatory reporting of abuse complaints or statistics.\n\nHuman Rights Watch found that child abuse in sport remains accepted and normalized in many parts of society, and that it is difficult for young athletes to file complaints against a powerful coach or official. Schools and federations rarely punish abusive coaches, often allowing them to continue coaching.\n\nIn some cases, abuse of child athletes has directly resulted in life-long injury or death. For example, in 2004, a 15-year-old boy from Yokohama had skipped judo practice; his coach found him and made him spar one-on-one. According to the boy’s mother, the coach choked her son until he lost consciousness, and then hit him to wake him up and choked him again when he briefly regained consciousness. The injury caused internal bleeding in the boy’s brain, resulting in life-long cognitive impairment.[37]\n\nIn reference to another case, Keiko Kobayashi, former director of Japan Judo Accident Victims Association, said: “My son became severely disabled from taibatsu during judo training. His case is only the tip of the iceberg.”[38]\n\nBetween 1983 and 2016, there were at least 121 individuals who died while participating in school judo in Japan.[39] It is unknown how many of these cases involved abuse by coaches, but the rate of judo deaths in Japan has “no parallel” in other developed nations.[40]\n\nHuman Rights Watch recommends that the Committee ask the government of Japan:\n\nWhat efforts has the government engaged in to ensure child athletes of abuse are able to speak up and report abuses?\n\nHas the government investigated any reports of child abuse in sport, and what has been the outcome of the investigation?\n\nWhat support or remedy has the government provided to child athletes of abuse?\n\nWill the government follow other governments to set up an independent Japan Center for Safe Sport, to allow reporting of abuses, remedy for athletes, and get abusive coaches who use taibatsu out of sport?\n\nHuman Rights Watch recommends that the Committee call on the government of Japan to:\n\nAmend the Basic Act on Sport or introduce a new law to explicitly: Ban all forms of abuse by coaches against child athletes in organized sport; Delineate the rights of athletes, including the right to participate in sport free of abuse; Mandate training for all coaches of child athletes; and Mandate that any adult who becomes aware of child athlete abuse must report it.\n\nAmend the Child Abuse Prevention Law to explicitly expand the existing definition of child abuse in article 2 so that it includes child abuse in organized sport.\n\nEstablish a Japan Center for Safe Sport, an independent administrative body tasked with addressing child abuse in Japanese sport. Among sports organizations, this independent body would have centralized administrative authority to address any allegation of child athlete abuse within organized sport in Japan. Responsibilities should include: Maintain standards to prevent and protect against child athlete abuse, and ensure full compliance with those standards by Japanese sports organizations; Receive complaints or reports of child athlete abuse directly, as well as via a centralized reporting system into which all existing reporting mechanisms would flow; Conduct investigations into all cases of child athlete abuse in organized sport, issue proportionate sanctions against coaches—such as revoking their coaching license, suspending or banning them from coaching—and provide an appeal system for sanctioned coaches; Refer abuse cases to law enforcement for criminal investigation, where appropriate; Track and report data on the number of allegations, and the outcomes of investigations; Create a public registry of coaches who are sanctioned; Ensure free, ongoing, professional psychological support services for child athletes who have experienced abuse; Establish training standards for all coaches of child athletes; and Conduct education and awareness campaigns about the existence of this independent body, and the resources it provides.\n\n",
    "Buying a home in Japan: What you should consider": "With the dollar currently so strong against the yen, many people abroad are looking at the Japanese real estate market as an attractive investment.\n\nBut understanding the basics of buying a home in Japan is important before making a decision. Prospective buyers living overseas need to be aware of real estate market trends, interest rates, financing options based on their visa status, consulting with banks to find out how much they can borrow, tax benefits and tax deductions.\n\nOne company which provides assistance to people living overseas and foreign residents in Japan, who are interested in buying a home in Japan is LINC Inc which has partnerships with various professionals such as architects, lawyers, judicial and administrative scriveners.\n\nJapan Today hears more from LINC CEO and founder Shinichi Kawamura.\n\nWhat is your background?\n\nMy background is primarily in business consulting and real estate. I have also worked for marketing firms abroad. After graduating from Japanese university, I worked for Sekisui House, the largest construction company in Japan. Then I went to the UK to study for an MBA.\n\nAfter coming back to Japan, I worked for a consulting company providing consulting services mainly to construction and real estate companies. I established LINC in February 2018.\n\nWhat services does LINC offer?\n\nReal estate is our main business. We provide support for registration and basically all other services related to real estate. In addition, we offer architectural design and remodeling services.\n\nHow many in your team? Are they bilingual?\n\nWe are a team of four. And all four of us can speak English.\n\nHow do you market the company?\n\nBasically, the online seminars held by GPlusMedia are opportunities for us to get in touch with our clients. We only target foreigners who are living or planning to live in Japan. Therefore, since our target population is not that large, we do not engage in mass marketing. Referrals and word of mouth are our other major marketing tools.\n\nHow has the pandemic affected LINC’s business?\n\nThe pandemic very much affected our business. For the past three years, property owners were reluctant to sell their own properties, and there was a period of time when prospective buyers wanted to buy property but could not. Then, demand was there but supply was not, and real estate prices continued to rise.\n\nUnfortunately, in addition to the pandemic, there was another factor that made the real estate market even more challenging. In Japan, there was what we call the \"wood shock,\" a sharp rise in the price of lumber. This increased the value of buildings, including detached homes.\n\nThis period was a very difficult time for prospective buyers, as there were few properties on the market that they wanted to buy, and even if there were, they were too expensive to purchase.\n\nDo you get a lot of inquiries from foreigners overseas and in Japan who wish to buy property?\n\nYes, we do get a lot of inquiries. Recently, we have been receiving more inquiries from foreigners living in Japan. Perhaps this is because COVID-19 has settled down and Japan has become more accepting of foreigners.\n\nWhat are prospective buyers' main concerns?\n\nOne of the most frequent inquiries is whether they can get a bank loan. Currently, Japanese bank loan interest rates are very low, in the low 0.5% range for variable interest rates, for example. Many foreigners are thinking of taking out a loan at this time.\n\nHowever, in order to obtain a loan from a Japanese bank, you must have a permanent residence or working visa in Japan. You must also have lived in Japan for at least one year (there are exceptions). You have a high probability of getting a loan if you have worked and lived in Japan for at least three years and at least five years, respectively.\n\nWith the dollar strong, is now a good time for foreigners overseas to buy property in Japan?\n\nOf course. It is a prerequisite that you buy a place where the real estate you are buying is of high value, but now is a good time for foreigners to buy real estate in Japan, especially if they have cash abroad.\n\nOne thing to note is that foreigners who do not have permanent residency status are basically required to pay 20% of the real estate value in cash when taking out a loan in Japan. Therefore, many people pay this 20% in cash with their savings abroad.\n\nWhat are some things that surprise foreigners wanting to buy property in Japan, that they didn’t know before you told them?\n\nOne thing in particular that surprises them is the lack of price negotiation. Occasionally, they may make an offer at a very low price relative to the indicated price. However, this rarely works in Japan. There is no culture of repeatedly haggling over the price, as in auctions. In many cases in Japan, if you offer a very low amount against the indicated price, the property owner will refrain from selling to you. I believe this is because Japan has a tradition of valuing civility and wabisabi more than business. Japanese people may feel that they do not want people who are not like themselves to live in the house they are selling.\n\nThis is gradually changing these days, but the tendency still remains.\n\nIn webinars you have spoken about **akiya (abandoned vacant homes). What are the main risks that potential buyers need to consider before such properties?**\n\nBuying an akiya is very difficult. In some cases, it is more expensive than buying a regular house because of the maintenance and remodeling that is needed. In addition, the average real estate agent will not deal with the house because of the special skills required to survey the house.\n\nAnother point is that since most vacant houses are older, loans cannot be used. Therefore, it is necessary to pay in cash. Because of this need for special information, it is necessary to consult with a company that offers services such as \"vacation rentals\".\n\nFor more information on LINC, visit https://lincon.co.jp/\n\n© Japan Today",

    "Not Just Japan! Three Stellar Asian Destinations Are Opening Up": "After two years of speculation, a few false starts and countless cancelled, speculative trips — Japan is reopening. This time, for real. Visitors from visa-waiver countries will be able to enter without hassle, and the days of booking a ticket and jetting off are pretty much back.\n\nThat’s the big headline, but there’s more.\n\nIn almost synchronized fashion, two other major destinations in the region followed suit, with plans to drop quarantine or open completely. Taiwan is reopening, and Hong Kong will finally diverge from the insane bureaucratic policies of China.\n\nAsia Heads Toward A Full Reopening\n\nYou simply can’t say that Asia has full reopened until China welcomes visitors, or ends its zero tolerance health strategy, but still — virtually all the rest of Asia has.\n\nWith news that Taiwan will open almost fully from October 13th and Japan will open restriction free travel from October 11th, there’s new excitement in the region. More flights are set to resume on top carriers including EVA, China Airlines (a Taipei based airline), ANA and Japan Airlines.\n\nMore tourism focused destinations in Asia, including Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore opened many months ago, but these final holdouts remained a mystery. Here’s what’s changing in the weeks to come, and how it will have a huge impact on destinations all over the region.\n\nTaiwan Is Dropping Most Restrictions\n\nFrom October 13th, Taiwan plans to relax entry restrictions, including dropping any quarantine period or arrival testing. The country was blossoming as a destination of diverse tourism opportunity in 2019, and looks to pick up where it left off.\n\nIf you venture that way, the Alishan forest is stunning and Chiayi is a foodie heaven. Further details on reopening plans and what’s needed to enter can be found here and here.\n\nJapan Readies For Tourism\n\nAfter initial plans left us with disappointing restrictions, such as packaged guided tours only, Japan is finally reopening in full.\n\nPeople who could enter with a visa on arrival, or visa program before can once again do so from October 11th. Proof of vaccination is still required to avoid any restrictions, but that’s about it!\n\nIt’s time to branch out beyond Tokyo and explore the delights of Osaka, and other fascinating cities which remain far too overlooked by most visitors.\n\nHong Kong Enters The Tourism Chat\n\nHong Kong is ending its mandatory quarantine period. That’s the good news. The bad news, is that post arrival testing and three days of “medical supervision” will still follow.\n\nThose and other factors mean GSTP will be giving this once beloved destination a pass for a while, until things change. After seeing countless horror stories from Penny Bay, the changes seem like an extremely positive development for residents and regional visitors, but perhaps still a long cry from “open” for international tourism.\n\nGreat News For Travel Savings\n\nWhether you’re flying to to Taiwan or Japan as your final destination, or not, this is big news. With few airlines operating regular schedules, great itineraries, or prices were very hard to come by. Seats using points were virtually non-existent.\n\nAs leading airlines based in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan seek to reboot international routes, there should be a significant dip in pricing followed by a significant opening of points seats. Plus, hotels should remain reasonable, with currencies such as the yen nearing all time lows.",
    "Japan’s Government Gives Go-Ahead on Wage Increases, But Companies Want Growth First": "Japan Data\n\nWhile the Japanese government wants companies to increase pay, many managers believe it is difficult to do so without achieving growth.\n\nAccording to a survey on wages conducted by Persol Research Institute in May 2022, 63.0% of company managers in Japan answered that without company growth, it would be difficult to make increases. It indicated that they were prioritizing growth over raising pay.\n\nHowever, the number of those in management who believed “wage increases are an investment” were more than double those who thought “wage increases mean higher costs,” showing recognition that pay rises are needed as an investment for growth. Opinions were divided on whether the government should be involved in this discussion.\n\nAt 40.6%, the factor most influencing the decision over increasing wages was “meeting budgets and results,” followed by “preventing employee turnover” (29.4%) and “economic trends” (27.9%). “Price trends” was the fourth largest factor. Requests from the government or the Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengō) were shown to have little influence over management decisions.\n\n(Translated from Japanese. Banner photo © Pixta.)",
    "The changing of the guard in corporate Japan": "26 September 2022\n\nHow younger executives are addressing corporate Japan’s failures.\n\nJapan’s reputation among international investors is still mixed. The late prime minister Shinzo Abe did a lot to make Japan attractive to foreign investors but one man could only do so much. Fears about corporate governance practices, a slow adoption of digital technologies compared to other Western nations and sluggish conglomerates remain.\n\nReally addressing these issues will take more than a dynamic prime minister; it needs a generational-shift. We need to see a change in corporate culture and in the mind-set of senior executives. Here there are promising signs. What we’re seeing currently is a changing of the guard in corporate Japan, which could pave the way for a transformation of Japanese companies.\n\nThe ‘baby boomer’ generation contributed to Japan’s high economic growth from the 1960s to the 1980s. Their fairly consistent success meant that they were ‘married’ to their principles, making them ill-prepared to deal with the economic slowdown in the 1990s and beyond, as well as the drastic changes initiated by IT in the 2000s. Many of these ‘boomers’ are rapidly approaching (or have already surpassed) the retirement age of 65; their younger counterparts are acceding to corporate dominance, bringing with them a willingness to change.\n\nThe new generation are more aggressive in terms of investment, and more willing to accept that failures are hard to avoid on the path to ultimate success. This, combined with a population that is now ready for digital innovation because of the pandemic, during which many companies were forced to find innovative, tech-led solutions to survive, means the transformation of Japanese companies can finally happen.\n\nOne change is the increasing number of companies incorporating digital platforms into their business models. This has made it possible for SMEs with innovative services and products to develop their business. For example, M3 Inc., a medical-technology company, has pioneered the shift from face-to-face meetings between doctors and medical representatives to virtual consultations, a service now used by 90% of doctors in Japan.\n\nDigitisation is likely to reshape the manufacturing market too, where companies such as MISUMI GROUP Inc. are abandoning analogue processes to bring their operations online. A willingness to invest in these processes typifies the attitude needed for sustained growth. These changes are, of course, driven in part by Covid-19, but they would not exist without the increased IT literacy of the new generation of executives and their willingness to take risks.\n\nFurther change is being led by the globalisation of non-manufacturing companies in Japan. Historically, the Japanese export market has been dominated by manufacturers, who capitalised on the cheap labour available to them on the Asian mainland to offer competitive prices in the global market. However, retail and luxury companies are increasingly taking more risks to expand their operations overseas as they are being led by younger, bolder executives.\n\nLeading the charge here are companies such as the retail conglomerate Ryohin Keikaku, who made the unorthodox decision to hire a CEO from outside the company, Nobuo Domae, in 2021. This is not common practice in Japan yet it epitomises the new way of thinking led by executives from generation ‘X’, in contrast to the intransigent ‘boomers’ of yesteryear.\n\nTypically, Japanese companies appointed a CEO from within. This executive was usually in their sixties; during their tenure, they were expected to steer the course but not to rock the boat, and for only a short number of years before retirement. Because of this, there was little to incentivise expansionary strategies that carry risk. Younger CEOs are tasked with growth, rather than consistency. Coupled with increased IT literacy and a less parochial attitude towards change, the new generation are ready to alter the course of Japanese businesses.\n\nWhile there are numerous bold and positive steps being taken, the picture in corporate Japan is not all positive. Corporations remain largely resistant to adopting new IT protocols for fear of system failures; this caution dampens the drive towards digitisation. Many retail companies have not yet embraced the change. Often,they still rely too heavily on Japan’s ageing population for demand, which is inherently unsustainable. Short of a reversal in the ageing population, these companies need to be aggressive internationally if they are to see growth rather than contraction. The current slide of the Yen to historic lows ought to be seen as an opportunity by Japanese retailers with aspirations of increasing global market share.Japan also lags behind its Asian neighbours with its proclivity to keep processes in-house. While this is a good thing for operational resilience, the refusal to outsource damages efficiency, as firms are not taking advantage of the numerous innovations made by other companies. As the next generation takes the reigns, will this unwillingness to outsource will be forgotten in favour of flexibility?\n\nJapan finds itself at a crossroads. As the old generation moves aside and the new arrives, Japan can only hope this change is not too little or too late in the face of global economic crises, an ageing population and continued resistance to change in many Japanese businesses.\n\nTatsuya Suzuki, chief portfolio manager of the Japan Quality Growth strategy.

    "Major Covid Holdouts in Asia Drop Border Restrictions": "HONG KONG — After two and a half years of tight pandemic controls, some of Asia’s last holdouts are opening their borders, as they move to bolster their economies and play catch-up with a world that has largely learned to live with Covid.\n\nHong Kong said on Friday that it would abandon mandatory hotel quarantine for people coming to the city starting next week, following a similar move by Taiwan. Japan said it would drop its daily limit on arrivals and fully open its doors to tourists on Oct. 11.\n\nThe flurry of moves this week have left just one major country with strict border controls: China, where the ruling Communist Party still clings to its “zero Covid” policy. Those who travel to China, mainly residents, still face 10 days of hotel quarantine at their own expense."
