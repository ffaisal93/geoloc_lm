    "To Save Its Renowned Nature, Australia Invests More in Indigenous Management": "Australia is a continent that faces unique pressures, particularly from introduced species and catastrophic wildfires exacerbated by rapidly changing climate. Indigenous Australians have lived throughout the continent for millennia and know best how to manage many of those pressures. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have developed an intimate understanding of their homelands’ nature and seasons, including the role that fire has in the natural world’s regeneration and preservation.\n\nIn recent decades, the Australian Government has been moving toward recognising the knowledge and leadership Indigenous Australians have shown in protecting more of their lands through the highly successful Indigenous Protected Areas (IPAs) program. Under the program, which started in 1998, the country has designated 81 IPAs covering more than 85 million hectares of land and 4 million hectares of sea country.\n\nBut with more than 20% of Australia held, in some form, by Indigenous peoples, more IPAs are needed. These land and sea areas include some of Australia’s most exceptional natural environments, rich with native plants and animals—including many threatened species—that require ongoing care to survive. These areas are also home to some of the oldest artistic and cultural sites in the world.\n\nFortunately, the Australian Government recently announced new funding commitments for IPAs and for the country’s Indigenous Ranger Program—a welcome step toward ensuring both programs’ continued success.\n\nIPAs are partnerships led by Traditional Owners (Aboriginal people with certain rights and responsibilities in relation to land or sea) and supported by the Australian Government. They build community and strengthen local governance—for example, by supporting people in applying Indigenous ecological knowledge, fostering cultural ties within Indigenous groups, passing knowledge from Elders to younger community members and protecting sacred sites.\n\nDecision-making, conservation planning, and management work within IPAs is led by Traditional Owners through their local land and sea management organisations, in agreement with the Government. IPA plans also prioritise the management of key Outback environmental threats, such as feral animals, invasive weeds and destructive wildfires. Work can also include protecting rock art, collaborating with researchers, managing fires for the best outcomes for people and nature, and welcoming visitors.\n\nFurther, IPAs typically create a highly productive means for Traditional Owners to develop and strengthen partnerships with state and federal agencies and other stakeholders, such as non-profit conservation groups, local industry and research organisations. As the leaders and primary managers of IPAs, Traditional Owners are the central drivers of key decisions applying to their estates.\n\nIn September 2021, the Government announced consultation funding to develop 7 new IPAs encompassing 3.7 million hectares. The proposed IPAs stretch from the Torres Strait and Cape York regions of Queensland across to the Kimberley and Pilbara areas of Western Australia; developing full management plans will take several years.\n\nOver the coming years, with millions of more hectares of IPAs planned, these areas are expected to make up more than 50% of Australia's National Reserve System and will be key to the country meeting its domestic and international responsibilities to manage nature and protect important cultural values.\n\nLong-term work by the Country Needs People partnership of more than 40 frontline Indigenous land and sea management groups has backed the growth and development of the IPA network, community-based Indigenous ranger jobs and protected area co-management initiatives around Australia. The Pew Charitable Trusts is proud to be a key supporter of Country Needs People.\n\nIndigenous rangers are funded principally through the Australian Government’s Indigenous Ranger Program, which supports Traditional Owners in combining Indigenous traditional and local knowledge with other techniques to protect and care for the land and sea.\n\nIn a separate but related move, in March 2022 the Australian Government committed to doubling Indigenous ranger jobs throughout Australia, over time, with a $636 million investment in the program. The ambitious commitment to doubling ranger jobs by 2030 and increasing funding for IPAs was reiterated by the newly elected government in May, as part of its longstanding policy position.\n\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples throughout Australia are driven by a strong will to sustain culture and connection to Country. Their work managing pressures on the landscape through locally driven organisations and initiatives such as Indigenous ranger programs are key to ensuring a viable future for sustainable management of Australia’s land and sea.\n\nIndigenous Protected Areas and Indigenous rangers are world-leading examples of how governments and others can partner with Indigenous leadership in land and sea management. These programs are vital to local communities—for cultural, economic and environmental reasons—and Pew applauds the Australian Government for its continued commitment to these programs’ success.\n\nMichelle Grady directs Pew’s Outback to Oceans program in Australia.",
    "UN Rights Body Rules Australia Failed to Protect from Climate Change": "Click to expand Image A woman walks past palm trees on Saibai Island in the Torres Strait, August 9, 2006. © 2006 Andrew Mears/Fairfax Media via Getty Images\n\nThe United Nations Human Rights Committee on September 23 found that the Australian government had violated the rights of Indigenous Torres Strait Islanders by failing to adequately protect them against the adverse impacts of climate change.\n\nThe groundbreaking decision of the committee, an independent expert body that monitors state compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), establishes important protections under international human rights law for climate-affected communities.\n\nThe complaint was the first legal action brought by climate-vulnerable inhabitants of low-lying islands against a state. Eight Australian nationals and their children, Indigenous inhabitants of the Torres Strait region, alleged that Australia failed to implement an adaptation program to ensure the long-term habitability of the islands.\n\nThe committee heard that changes in weather patterns harmed the Islanders’ livelihoods, culture, and traditional way of life. Severe flooding caused by tidal surges destroyed family graves, while heavy rainfall and storms degraded the land and reduced the amount of food available from traditional fishing and farming.\n\nThe committee found that despite construction of some seawalls on the islands, the Australian government had not taken sufficient steps to protect the Islanders’ homes and livelihoods. The committee also found that that the government had not provided the Islanders with a way to maintain their traditional way of life and transmit their culture to their children.\n\n“States that fail to protect individuals under their jurisdiction from the adverse effects of climate change may be violating their human rights under international law,” said Hélène Tigroudja, a committee member.\n\nUnder the Optional Protocol to the ICCPR, states have an obligation to provide those whose rights have been violated with an effective remedy. The committee ruled Australia should pay adequate compensation to the claimants and secure the communities’ “continued safe existence” on the islands.\n\nThe Human Rights Committee decision paves the way for further legal action and compensation claims by other climate-affected communities around the globe. It sends a clear warning to all governments that they need to protect citizens from climate harm, and failure to do so may make them legally liable. To avoid similar violations in the future, the government should immediately adopt robust and rights-respecting climate mitigation and adaptation policies consistent with the best available science.",
    "Australia’s Budding Climate Change Reversal": "Advertisement\n\nOver the past decade, it would have been absurd to suggest that Australia could be a global leader in mitigating climate change and driving a shift to renewable energy. Although there is little doubt that Australia has the environmental conditions to become a major renewable energy power, the country’s politics have been mired in the politicization of climate change and energy policy, wasting both critical time and economic opportunity.\n\nThis has also proved a massive own goal with its broader strategic goals in its immediate region. Australia’s climate recalcitrance has often strained relationships with its Pacific neighbors, which understand climate change to be their primary security threat, and deem it essential that any power within the Pacific Islands Forum shared their position.\n\nHowever, the change of government in Australia in May has created a noticeable shift in Canberra’s attitude. Given that the Australian public made climate change one of the key themes of May’s election, Labor has clearly understood there was a pressing need to draw a line under Australia’s “lost decade.” In early September the parliament passed significant climate change legislation that pledged to reduce Australia’s carbon emissions by 43 percent by 2030 and move to net zero emission by 2050. The new legislation will now give Australia’s energy sector the certainty necessary to shift itself toward cleaner energy, after years of policy confusion.\n\nTo explain Australia’s new shift in policy and posture, Minister for Climate Change and Energy Chris Bowen has been in the United States this past week. Bowen initially attended the Global Clean Energy Forum in Pittsburgh, and subsequently delivered a speech to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, which outlined Australia’s plans for its energy transition, and how Canberra now seeks to play a leading diplomatic role in the global effort to cut humanity’s carbon emissions.\n\nDiplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. Get the Newsletter\n\nBowen framed his speech by shifting the language on the world’s timeline to create a significant energy shift. Rather than the seemingly distant 2030, Bowen pointed out that this is just 87 months away, and that there are a number of urgencies that need to be addressed with regard to infrastructure to create a renewables-led future. Bowen highlighted current supply chain vulnerabilities, with around 80 percent of solar panels being manufactured in China, as well as China dominating the market in lithium-ion batteries used for both energy storage and electric vehicles. Bowen said it was in the interests of both Australia and the U.S. to develop greater renewable manufacturing capabilities, with the two countries providing more reliable supply chains for each other.\n\nEnjoying this article?

Just $5 a month.\n\nThe key strategic problem for Australia is transforming itself from its current position of simply mining critical minerals used in renewable technology into a manufacturing power. Bowen mentioned the problem but offered no pathways to achieving the greater goal. Australia’s current Critical Minerals Strategy has sought to develop greater local capabilities to process critical minerals but lacks the ambition to see Australia as more than just a supplier of materials to the advanced manufacturing capabilities in Japan and South Korea.\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine highlighted problems with the world’s reliance on energy from nefarious states like Russia or even states with poor human rights records like Saudi Arabia. Bowen noted that “renewable energy has in-built security advantages” with both sunlight and wind being unaffected by geopolitical disruptions or calculations. Here Bowen was echoing German Finance Minister Christian Lindner who upon Russia’s invasion of Ukraine stated that renewables were “the energy of freedom.”\n\nThe important questions now for Australia are whether it is capable of making the necessary investments to achieve this freedom, and does the country have the credibility to play a leading role in global climate change mitigation diplomacy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA recent report from the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering indicates that the country is on track to generate half its domestic energy needs from renewable sources by 2025, with Bowen stating that the government’s objective is to expand this to 82 percent by 2030.\n\nThis is a positive trajectory, but it is not solely the sources of its domestic energy consumption that Australia needs to shift, as the country has a massive fossil fuel export industry that should be considered part of its emissions, even if it doesn’t burn the fuel itself. While Australia’s domestic energy consumption currently accounts for around 1.1 percent of global emissions, when taking into account the predominantly coal and gas Australia exports, the country’s footprint expands to around 5 percent of global emissions. Given that Australia’s population is only 0.33 percent of the global total, this makes Australia a major per capita emitter.\n\nAustralia clearly has a great responsibility to be part of the global solution to climate change. The new Australian government looks to be recognizing this, and this is something that will be welcomed by its neighbors in the Pacific. Yet these Pacific neighbors will also be keeping a keen eye on Australia’s actions, to see whether this shift in rhetoric is also accompanied by a serious shift in behavior.",
    "Australia plans privacy overhaul after huge telecom data leak": "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says reforms would allow banks to ‘protect their customers’.\n\nAustralia will overhaul its privacy rules to allow banks to be informed of data breaches in the corporate world, following a huge leak of personal information from the country’s second-biggest telecom.\n\nSpeaking on local radio on Monday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the hacking of No 2 telecom Optus was a “huge wake-up call” that necessitated reforms that would alert financial institutions to cyberattacks and allow them to “protect their customers.”\n\nUnder the planned changes, businesses would be required to alert banks of data breaches involving customers so that lenders could monitor their accounts for suspicious activity.\n\nCybersecurity Minister Clare O’Neill said over the weekend that details of what “steps need to be taken in the future” would be announced in the coming days.\n\nOptus disclosed last week that the personal details of up to 10 million users may have been compromised following one of the biggest data breaches in Australian history.\n\nThe carrier, which is owned by Singapore Telecommunications, has said the compromised information includes names, addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, and driver’s licence and passport numbers.\n\nA self-identified hacker has since posted messages online threatening to expose information obtained in the leak unless Optus pays a ransom of $1m in cryptocurrency.\n\nAlthough Optus has not identified who is behind the cyberattack, the telecom has said the attacker’s IP address can be traced to a number of countries in Europe.\n\nTrevor Long, a technology industry analyst based in Sydney, said the proposed reforms did not go far enough.\n\n“Customers are angry, they are talking about leaving Optus, and we still don’t truly know the size of the issue as Optus are not releasing numbers,” Long told Al Jazeera.\n\n“The government needs to put in place a simple credit-blocking mechanism for people to use to turn off the ability for credit to be applied for under their name. Turn it on when you want a loan or credit card, turn it off when you don’t. That off switch effectively cuts off any fraudsters at the first hurdle.”\n\nThe data breach at Optus is the latest in a string of cyberattacks this month involving leading companies, including Samsung, North Face, American Airlines and Uber.",
    "Australia’s growth revised lower, but AAA rating steady": "Treasurer Jim Chalmers said the global economy was in a “difficult and dangerous place” – with slowing global growth, rampant inflation, falling real wages, and extreme uncertainty.\n\n“These challenges are intensifying, not dissipating, and Australia is not spared from this darker and more dangerous global outlook,” he said.\n\nThe largest downgrades were in the Eurozone, with a recession now on the cards in Russian gas-reliant Germany. The US is expected to eke out 0.5 per cent growth next year, while the United Kingdom will stall or contract.\n\n“Australia [has] somewhat stronger growth momentum currently than Europe and the United States,” the OECD said. “But that is projected to wane over the coming quarters, in part due to softer external demand.”\n\nRatings agency S & P also revised down its 2023 Australian economic outlook on Monday, slashing expected growth in gross domestic product by a full 1 percentage point to 1.8 per cent for the year due to a sharp upward revision in the outlook for the official interest rate to 3.1 per cent by year’s end.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnthony Walker, director of sovereign ratings at S & P, said higher interest rates would “narrow” Australia’s servicing costs headroom within the AAA rating band, but despite some headwinds there was plenty of wiggle room.\n\n“Which means that we don’t expect the rating to change at this point,” Mr Walker said, adding the next major trigger point for Australia rating would be Labor’s first federal budget next month.\n\nHSBC Australian chief economist Paul Bloxham said while there were headwinds, Australia would likely avoid a recession.\n\n“Australia’s economy is doing well,” Mr Bloxham said. “Spending is strong, the unemployment rate remains low and the labour market is strong.\n\nThe OECD called for “short-term fiscal support” to cushion the most vulnerable households being hit by high-energy prices, but warned against moves that could put upward pressure on inflation.\n\nDr Chalmers said next month’s budget would be about providing cost-of-living relief without spurring inflation and forcing interest rates even higher.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut with the Coalition’s temporary $6 billion halving of the fuel tax set to expire on Wednesday night, the Treasurer pushed back against calls for the relief to be extended for a further three months at a cost of $3 billion.\n\nAfter slumping about 20 per cent from July peaks, the national average petrol price edged 10.4¢ higher last week to $1.73 a litre, the largest lift in more than 18 weeks after hitting a nine-month low the week before.\n\nThe removal of the fuel tax cut will add about 22¢ a litre at the bowser.\n\nBut fears of a global downturn pushed global oil prices down recently, which will help offset the hit to household budgets. Brent crude fell by $US4.31 ($6.6) or 4.8 per cent to $US86.15 a barrel on Friday",
    "Australia is the wealthiest nation on earth — that’s bad news for most": "Look alive, Australians, for we are the “richest people in the world”.\n\nOr so many media outlets reported last week, after investment bank Credit Suisse released its latest Global Wealth Report.\n\nIt found the median Australian's wealth was approximately $408,717 in 2021, with Belgium, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Denmark rounding out the top five. Almost 2.2 million Australians are now millionaires, up 390,000 since 2020.",
    "Australian Fire Danger Ratings": "What are fire danger ratings?\n\nFire danger ratings describe the potential level of danger should a bushfire start and are calculated using a combination of weather forecasting and information about vegetation that could fuel a fire.\n\nWhy are we reducing the number of ratings?\n\nExtensive social research found that most people in bushfire risk areas don’t understand the current system. There were calls for a simpler, action-oriented system.\n\nBut with more days and prolonged fire seasons shouldn’t we be getting more information?\n\nThe science that sits behind Fire Danger Rating modelling is being improved. A better understanding of how different fuel types burn and improvements in technology means we can more accurately predict the risk faced by communities on any given day.\n\nBut I work in an industry that requires more specific fire danger information?\n\nIndustries and members of the community who need more information will be able to access the Fire Behaviour Index, which will give a more in-depth level of detail about the fire danger.\n\nThe new system doesn’t look that different to the old system, so why bother changing it at all?\n\nCommunity research found that most people were familiar with the old system, it just seemed too technical and irrelevant for them. We have made significant changes to how we calculate fire danger risk, so that the ratings and information provided to the community is more accurate.\n\nWho is responsible for these changes?\n\nThe AFDRS is being coordinated by NSW RFS and AFAC (the National Council for Fire and Emergency Services), with support from the Bureau of Meteorology. A National Program Board, with representation from each of the State and Territories’ fire agencies are overseeing the program, which is being delivered by local implementation teams.",

    "Australian offshore wind guide 2.0": "Introduction Australia’s national regulatory framework for offshore energy came into effect in June 2022. Since then, there has been a flurry of activity in the offshore wind sector with domestic and international developers announcing new projects almost every week. This includes Copenhagen Energy’s proposal to develop four 3GW offshore windfarms, which will be the largest in Australia if they go ahead. As the May 2022 edition of our Australian Offshore Wind Guide will attest, the sector is set to lead Australia’s energy transition, with: 25 announced offshore wind farms;\n\nthe offshore wind sector proposing to install over 2,000 GW of offshore wind turbines within 100km of current electricity substations; and\n\nthe largest coal-fired power station in Australia (Eraring) to be decommissioned in 2025. As such, this edition of our Australian Offshore Wind Guide is focussed on the developers who are leading the sector, their projects, and the regulatory developments that have been put in place to ensure the continued growth of Australian offshore wind. Clayton Utz expertise Clayton Utz's updated Australian Offshore Wind Guide provides an insight into key developments and relevant legislation, informed by our recent experience and research in the offshore wind sector. Peter Staciwa (Partner, Project Development & Finance) previously explored how Australia can capitalise on its offshore wind potential, which can be viewed here. Clayton Utz continues to act for The Star of the South project and its main investor Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners. The Star of the South Project is Australia’s first and most advanced offshore windfarm project. The team is led by Peter Staciwa and involves partners Rory Moriarty, Andrew Leece, Damien Gardiner, Cilla Robinson, Pip Mitchell, Alison Kennedy and Jo Pugsley. As the offshore wind industry continues to develop, Clayton Utz will remain at the forefront of all regulatory changes, project development and relevant industry news. Regulatory Frameworks and Policy Targets The enhanced regulatory frameworks implemented by the Commonwealth, Victorian and New South Wales Governments signal their intention to establish a leading offshore wind industry. The Australian Government’s Offshore Electricity Infrastructure (OEI) framework which came into effect in June 2022 provides clarity and certainty to investors wanting to build Australia's offshore energy future. The Australian Government has also announced its intention to commence public consultation with respect to six proposed offshore wind regions. Technology The global boom in offshore wind has lowered turbine costs, and accelerated development in technology including the size and design of turbines, allowing offshore wind to upscale quickly, particularly as coal plants are decommissioned. As floating turbine technology is further developed and becomes cheaper, we will see a greater uptake of offshore wind farms in Australia, as our best resources are located in deeper water which renders turbines on fixed foundations inaccessible. While floating turbine technology has not progressed as far as fixed turbine technology, the industry clearly is positive about future developments with about 30% of projects currently proposed in Australia being floating offshore wind projects and Blue Economy holding its seminar on Trends, Challenges and Future Perspectives for Floating Offshore Wind Turbine Development earlier this month. Location Offshore wind projects located close to current renewable energy projects have the potential to capitalise on existing infrastructure and established grid connections. As traditional power stations retire, the offshore wind sector can also take advantage of the skilled workforces and contractors who will become available. A Blue Economy report identified the Hunter, Illawarra, Western Australia and Gippsland regions as desirable energy locations. These regions benefit from abundantly windy offshore conditions at times of low onshore wind and solar generation, creating more reliable year-round generation capacity. The Bass Strait off Gippsland, Victoria is the region closest to being ready for offshore wind development.\n\nPart A: the developers The offshore wind sector in Australia is pioneered by a few key players. The top developers to follow are: Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP): Danish fund manager CIP specialises in energy infrastructure investments. It is one of the largest developers of offshore wind globally. In Australia, CIP is the majority owner (90 per cent) of the Star of the South Project, Australia’s most progressed offshore wind farm. Star of the South alone has the potential to power around 1.2 million homes and supply up to 20 per cent of Victoria’s electricity needs. It is expected to help replace the Yallourn coal power plant, due to close in 2028. In May 2022, CIP sold a 10 per cent interest in the Star of the South Project to Cbus Super. Macquarie | Green Investment Group: Macquarie Group’s offshore wind business is conducted through Corio Generation, a portfolio company of GIG. While Corio Generation operates on a stand-alone basis, it has deep access to long-term capital and offshore wind expertise via Macquarie Group. Corio Generation is the developer of two offshore wind farms with a total proposed capacity of 4GW. Both projects will be located off the coast of Gippsland. Iberdrola: Spanish investor Iberdrola has clearly established itself as one of the biggest renewable energy project developers in the world, and a leader in offshore wind. Globally, it has 1.24GW of offshore wind capacity in operation, another 5.5GW under construction, and a target of 95GW of total renewable capacity by 2030. In July 2022 the renewable energy giant has announced its intention to invest in offshore wind projects in Gippsland by mid-2023. Given its expertise in the sector and its aggressive renewable capacity targets, Iberdrola will be an investor to follow once it enters the Australian offshore wind market. DP Energy: DP Energy is an international renewable energy company headquartered in Ireland. DP Energy has partnered with Iberdrola to develop the Pork Augusta Renewable Energy Park in South Australia and several offshore wind farms in the northern hemisphere (totalling 3GW proposed generation). In August 2022, DP Energy announced plans to develop five offshore wind projects in Australian state waters. A map published by DP Energy identifies areas off the coast of Warrnambool in Western Victoria, Wonthaggi and Port Albert in Victoria’s Gippsland region, and the Wollongong and Newcastle areas in NSW. Specific details and proposed capacity targets are yet to be announced. Australis Energy: Australis Energy is an offshore wind developer and origination company with significant project delivery experience in the United Kingdom. It is currently focussed on offshore wind opportunities in Australia and has developed three Australia offshore wind projects in a joint venture with GIP. The projects (located in Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia) will have a total capacity of 1.4GW. While these projects do not have the massive capacity of Star of the South or the GIG projects, Australis Energy was a relatively early entrant in the Australian offshore wind market which means that its projects are comparatively more progressed than others. The projects are also located close to existing infrastructure that will enable effective connection to regional electricity grids. Australis Energy and GIP have since announced that they intend to being construction on the three projects by 2030. Earlier this year GIP also named a new project development director for offshore wind, signalling its intention to continue targeting offshore wind opportunities. Oceanex Energy: Oceanex Energy is an Australian company specialising in offshore wind in both Australia and New Zealand. It is currently progressing the development and construction of four floating offshore wind farms off the New South Wales coast and a fixed offshore wind farm off Western Australia. The projects have a total proposed capacity of 9GW. Oceanex Energy was founded by Australians, Terry Evans and Peter Sgardelis, who also co-founded the Star of the South project. The founders still have an active role in leading Oceanex Energy. Equinor: Equinor is Norway’s largest oil and gas. In addition to oil and gas, Equinox has a portfolio of renewable and low-carbon projects, and a stated ambition of becoming a net-zero company by 2050. Equinor entered the Australian offshore wind market in August 2022 by acquiring an interest in three offshore wind farms proposed by Oceanex Energy in New South Wales. BlueFloat Energy: BlueFloat Energy is a global developer focussing on floating offshore wind technologies. It is currently developing two floating and two fixed offshore wind projects in Australia in partnership with Energy Estate. The projects have a total proposed capacity of 5.5GW. Energy Estate: Energy Estate is an Australian renewable developer with a portfolio of onshore and offshore wind, solar, green hydrogen, e-fuels and transmission projects, many of which it is co-developing with a range of partners. In June 2022 Energy Estate revealed plans to launch a A$500 million capital raising to underwrite its development pipeline, including its joint offshore wind projects. Copenhagen Energy: Copenhagen Energy is a Danish renewable energy developer founded in 2020. Since then, it has announced plans to develop four offshore wind farms off Western Australia with a total proposed capacity of 12GW. Despite its relative youth, Copenhagen Energy has signalled its intent to lead Western Australia’s energy transition by announcing that the each of its proposed offshore windfarms will power three million homes in Western Australia. Flotation Energy: Flotation Energy is a specialist developer and owner of offshore wind projects. It currently has three proposed offshore wind projects in Australia, with a total proposed capacity of 3.75GW. Alinta Energy: Alinta Energy owns and operates power stations and electrical and gas transmission assets across Australia and New Zealand. It is now exploring the potential for an offshore wind farm to supply the Portland Aluminium Smelter. If successful, the project will supply up to 100 per cent of the smelter’s energy needs and inject renewable energy into Australia’s main grid. Pilot Energy: Pilot Energy is an ASX listed oil and gas company that is currently exploring opportunities to leverage its existing oil and gas assets to develop renewable energy projects, including an offshore wind farm around its Cliff Head Offshore Oil Field production facilities. Pilot Energy entered into an agreement to sell a majority interest in the project to Triangle Energy, however the sale was abandoned in February 2022 when the National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator refused to grant regulatory approval to Triangle Energy. Nexsphere: Nexsphere is an Australian renewable energy developer, with a small team of Australian finance and infrastructure specialists. Its first project is the Bass Offshore Wind Energy Project based off the north-eastern coast of Tasmania. If successful, the project will generate between 0.5-1GW of renewable energy and support the Tasmanian Government’s impressive target of generating 200 per cent renewable energy. Shell Plc: Shell Plc is a major international energy oil and gas company expanding operations and diversifying from fossil fuels and into clean energy. Shell is now considering its own offshore wind project in Australia. investigating two sites in Gippsland. This would transform Shell’s Australian portfolio, with its first wind investment in Australia made in April 2022 when it acquired 49% in WestWind Energy Development Pty Ltd which has wind farms in Victoria, New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland. Ørsted: Danish offshore wind giant Ørsted is responsible for about 30 per cent of the world’s installed offshore wind capacity (excluding mainland China). While it has not yet entered the Australian offshore wind market, it will be interesting to see whether Ørsted joins other international developers which are increasingly showing interest in Australian offshore wind. RES: UK-headquartered renewables developer RES has also revealed an intention to develop offshore wind farms in Australia, starting with the Gippsland region where preliminary technical and ecological studies are already underway. While no formal plans have been released, the announcement itself is exciting given that RES is an experienced developer of offshore wind in Europe. We suspect that RES will also enrich the Australian offshore wind market with its experience as an operations and maintenance service provider.\n\nPart B: the projects\n\nPart C: the regulation Commonwealth Offshore Energy Infrastructure (OEI) Framework The national regulatory framework for offshore wind projects was established in June 2022 by the: Offshore Electricity Infrastructure Act 2021 ( OEI Act );\n\nOffshore Electricity Infrastructure (Regulatory Levies) Act 2021; and\n\nOffshore Electricity Infrastructure (Consequential Amendments) Act 2021 The OEI Framework is a welcome development in the offshore wind industry, as it introduced the licensing regime for offshore wind projects in Commonwealth waters (ie, the area from three nautical miles off the coast to the outer boundary of Australia’s exclusive economic zone). While the OEI Act set establishes the framework, the mechanics of the OEI Framework and licensing regime (including fees and the form of licence applications) will be contained in the regulations, which are still being developed. The Australian Government sought input on drafts of the Offshore Electricity Infrastructure Regulations 2022, Offshore Electricity Infrastructure (Regulation Levies) Regulations 2022 and Cost Recovery Implementation Statement. The public consultation on 22 April 2022, but we are yet to see the final regulations. Given the change in government since then, it will be interesting to see how the regulations have developed and if they reflect our new Labor government’s commitment to energy transition. Declared areas Importantly, the OEI Act empowers the Australian Government to designate areas to be used to develop offshore renewable energy infrastructure. In fact, a ministerial declaration must be made before feasibility or commercial licences can be granted over an area under the OEI Act. On 5 August, Federal Energy Minister for Climate Change and Energy Chris Bowen announced his intention to declare the Gippsland area as being open for offshore wind development, subject to a public consultation process. The minister is currently accepting submissions from the public. Once the consultation process concludes on 7 October, the industry will be keenly awaiting a formal declaration by the minister. We expect that the next consultation, after Gippsland, will be for the Hunter region. In the same announcement, the minister identified another five which have “world class offshore wind energy potential”. Public consultation for the regions (illustrated via the map and icons below), will be announced in due course: Pacific Ocean region off the Hunter in NSW;\n\nPacific Ocean region off the Illawarra in NSW;\n\nSouthern Ocean region off Portland in Victoria;\n\nBass Strait region off Northern Tasmania; and\n\nIndian Ocean region off Perth/Bunbury, WA Victoria (VIC) Victoria has placed offshore wind at the centre of its plan to meet its net-zero target by 2050. The state is targeting generation of 20 per cent of its energy needs from offshore wind within a decade. Studies commissioned by the Victorian Government found that the waters near Gippsland and Portland have the potential to support 13GW of capacity, equating to more than five times the current renewable energy generation in Victoria. These regions are close to existing grid infrastructure and experienced personnel in the energy sector, which means that they are ideally positioned to support Victoria's clean energy transition. Offshore Wind Policy Directions Paper The fund aims to bring intellectual property, innovation, local economic development and environmental benefits to the state, local businesses and communities and will be achieved through supporting activities that progress innovative projects in their commercialisation continuum. The plan relies on three staged capacity targets: 2GW by 2032 (this will involve procuring an initial offshore wind tranche); 4GW by 2035; and 9GW by 2040. To date, Victoria is the only state to have set offshore wind generation targets. It is a key part of the state’s plan to replace energy generated by the Yallourn and Loy Yang A power stations, which are due to close by 2028 and 2045 respectively. For now, the Offshore Wind Policy Directions Paper only communicates the state’s commitment to offshore wind. A more detailed plan will be unveiled in the Offshore Wind Implementation Statement, which will be released in September 2022. The statement should detail the expected scale and timing for Victoria’s first offshore wind procurement, as well as the state's plans to deliver a transmission network and port upgrades. An offshore wind business case will be prepared in 2024 and the 2032 target will be finalised in turn. Energy Innovation Fund (EIF) The Victorian Government is further supporting the offshore wind sector through the EIF, which is targeted at funding the commercialisation of renewable energy technologies in Victoria. It can fund up to 50 per cent of a project’s eligible expenditure (which includes contract preparation, wages, legal expenses, licensing and intellectual property costs, but not property acquisition or R&D costs). The fund is being delivered in multiple rounds with Round 1 of the EIF dedicated to offshore wind. As shown in Table 2 below, three projects secured funding under Round 1 with a total of $37.9 million provided to support the completion of feasibility and pre-construction activities. Applications for Round 2 of the fund, which was open to any renewable technology type, closed in September 2021. Successful proponents have not yet been announced by given the state’s clear emphasis on offshore wind and the number of projects being developed in the region, we would be interested to see if the list includes offshore wind proponents. Table 2: EIF Round 1 funding allocations New South Wales (NSW) With its long coastline and stable continental shelf, NSW has strong potential for offshore wind. While the NSW Government has not announced any regulation or targeted government support, it is hoping to attract offshore wind projects in its Renewable Energy Zones. Renewable Energy Zones (REZs) In NSW, the pathway for renewable projects has been lit by the Electricity Infrastructure Investment Act 2020 (NSW) (EII Act) and the NSW’s Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap, which received almost unanimous support in state parliament. The Roadmap will deliver five REZs in the Central-West Orana, Illawarra, New England, South-West and Hunter-Central Coast regions of NSW. The REZs will deliver an intended network capacity of 12GW. Central-West Orana The most progressed is the Central-West Orana REZ, which has three groups shortlisted to deliver the transmission network. Projects will also be able to bid for access rights from October 2022 according to AEMO’s draft tender guidelines. New England The New England REZ is intended to host a massive 8GW of wind, solar and storage projects. EnergyCo expects to commence the tender process for the New England REZ later in 2022. Illawarra In June 2022 EnergyCo called for registrations of interest for the Illawarra REZ. The Illawarra region is an industrial precinct and is well-placed to harness significant offshore wind generation. It is supported by existing energy infrastructure and a skilled workforce. The call is expected to receive significant interest from offshore wind projects. EnergyCo has revealed that two separate 2GW offshore wind projects have already been proposed off the coast of the Illawarra, which could connect to existing infrastructure to generate affordable, clean and reliable electricity. Offshore wind energy targets Following Victoria’s lead, the NSW Government is currently exploring opportunities to declare targets for offshore wind energy generation. In August 2022, EnergyCo appointed Arup Australia to conduct an offshore wind scoping study. At the time, the Department of Planning and Environment indicated that Arup’s report would inform the NSW Government’s policy options in relation to offshore wind. While no official targets have been announced yet, the Victorian targets were preceded by a similar study. The final report is expected to be released in early 2023. Floating offshore wind As noted above, the Federal Energy Minister for Climate Change and Energy has announced its intention to declare the Illawarra and Hunter regions in NSW as being ready for offshore wind development. However, the oceans in both regions are much deeper compared to the Gippsland region, for example. As such, developers would most likely need to install floating turbines. Currently all six offshore wind projects proposed in NSW will be floating wind farms. Given the renewed focus on improving floating technologies (discussed further in Part D), we may soon see this list grow. Table 3: Floating offshore wind projects in NSW\n\nPart D: industry development Blue Economy Cooperative Research Centre Offshore Wind Energy Report In July 2021, Blue Economy released its Offshore Wind Energy Report which found that Australia has high quality and abundant offshore wind resources with the potential to support 2,000 GW of power generation – far in excess of total current electricity generation. In particular, the report found that ongoing expansion to large 15MW turbines can enable single projects with capacity of 1-2 GW. This means that offshore wind can upscale rapidly as coal plants close and the energy transition accelerates. It also highlighted the need for a regulatory regime to facilitate these renewable energy projects, which is now coming to fruition with the implementation of the OEI Act. Blue Economy Seminar: Trends, Challenges and Future Perspectives for Floating Offshore Wind Turbine Development In September 2022, Blue Economy also held its industry seminar to discuss floating offshore wind technology. The seminar was clear that the industry needs to increase its use of floating offshore wind, as it can be installed in deeper water than fixed wind turbines. Floating offshore wind can therefore take advantage of the windier conditions that are experienced in deeper water. While floating technologies have not come as far as fixed technologies, the seminar signalled the sector’s keen interest in floating offshore wind. Importantly, the costs of floating offshore wind turbines are expected to decrease as developers upscale their designs. Developers are particularly focussed on redesigning their mooring systems so they can support a larger turbine size and harvest offshore wind energy more efficiently. Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO): Integrated System Plan (ISP) The ISP released by the AEMO in June 2022 reported that offshore wind has great potential in Australia because it is a high-quality resource which comes with lower social licence hurdles. The report also recognises that offshore wind has gained more support, and will continue to gain support, as some coal-fired power stations have brough forward their planned exits. The ISP found that the industry has a pressing need for dispatchable batteries which can manage daily and seasonal variations in the output from offshore wind (as well as the output from solar and onshore wind). While offshore wind did not feature prominently in the 2022 ISP, the reducing cost of offshore wind and increasing regulatory support from the Commonwealth and Victorian Governments is a critical development which could see this change in future ISPs. Consultants and advisors We have also seen a recent influx of renewable energy advisory services in the Australian market, which should support the growth of our offshore wind sector. For example, Green Giraffe has opened an office in Sydney, which will offer its full range of financial advisory services for energy transition projects and investors (including development equity, M&A, debt advisory, tender and strategic support). Nordic Renewables has also started providing project documentation and bankability data services to renewable projects out of Melbourne. Nordic Renewables was founded by Jacob Jacobsen who brings 18 years of global offshore wind experience to the role. First Power Renewables, founded by Star of the South’s former commercial director Adam Thyboe in August 2022, has also been established to provide expert commercial and advisory services to the Australian offshore wind sector. The cost of offshore wind is reducing, and further cost reductions could see it feature more prominently in future ISPs, particularly if it secures direct third-party support or land use considerations limit onshore development AEMO’s Integrated Systems Plan (June 2022)",

    "Western Australia opts in to new state class action regime": "Following the lead of other Australian states, a class action regime will soon be introduced in the Western Australian Supreme Court, which will have some key differences to those in other Australian jurisdictions.\n\nWith the enactment of the Civil Procedure (Representative Proceedings) Bill 2021 on 1 September 2022, Western Australia will soon have a new class actions regime. The Bill will not commence immediately so that the WA Supreme Court has the opportunity to develop supporting practice directions and rules to ensure that class action proceedings are conducted fairly and efficiently.\n\nThe road to the new class actions regime\n\nClass action reform has been under consideration in Western Australia for at least the last decade. In July 2011, the then Attorney General of Western Australia asked the Law Reform Commission of Western Australia to consider whether the principles, practices and procedures pertaining to representative proceedings being commenced in the courts of Western Australia required reform.\n\nUntil now, representative proceedings in Western Australia have been able to be conducted via Order 18 of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1971 (WA), but this regime is much less comprehensive than the Federal class action regime or those in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Tasmania.\n\nIn June 2015, after an extensive consultation process, the Commission published its Final Report, \"Representative Proceedings\", which recommended a class actions regime in the WA Supreme Court modelled on the Federal class actions regime found in Part IVA of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). The Commission determined that Order 18 was inadequate to facilitate large-scale class actions in Western Australian courts. Its recommendations reflected a concern to ensure that the Western Australian court system was meeting community expectations for access to justice.\n\nThe Western Australian Government first acted upon this recommendation in 2019 when it introduced a bill containing a class actions regime to the Western Australian Parliament. In proposing that Parliament effectively adopt legislation modelled on the Federal class actions regime, the Western Australian Government embraced comments from the Federal Court’s Justice Bernard Murphy that the federal regime had \"proved flexible and adaptable\" and that it \"provides real, practical and broad-based access to justice\". The bill passed the Legislative Assembly in September 2019 but remained with the Legislative Council until it was eventually prorogued by Parliament in December 2020. The Civil Procedure (Representative Proceedings) Bill 2021 is substantially similar.\n\nHow is the Western Australian regime different to those in other Australian jurisdictions?\n\nWhile the Bill is modelled on the Federal regime, it differs in several key respects.\n\nFirst, the Bill expressly permits representative plaintiffs bringing a class action against multiple defendants, irrespective of whether each named representative plaintiff has a claim against every defendant. The Federal regime does not have an equivalent provision and this has, historically, given rise to some uncertainty. The provision is intended to provide legislative clarity in respect of this issue.\n\nSecond, the Bill grants the Court specific powers, that do not appear in the Federal regime, to substitute the representative plaintiff in a class action with another group member where it is in the interests of justice to do so. The provision is intended to provide the Court with additional flexibility in circumstances where the lead plaintiff is not adequately representing the interests of group members who he or she represents.\n\nFinally, the Bill also contains a review clause to facilitate assessment of the operation and effectiveness of the regime in five years' time. That review must be undertaken by the Attorney General, with a report to be laid before both Houses of Parliament not later than 12 months after the five year anniversary of the legislation coming into force.\n\nGreenlighting litigation funding\n\nMaintenance and champerty make it unlawful to financially support litigation which the funder does not have a direct interest in or is party to (including in order to receive a cut of the proceeds obtained from the litigation). Following another Final Report from the Commission, the Bill also abolishes the torts of maintenance and champerty in Western Australia.\n\nThis move effectively gives the green light for litigation funders to finance Western Australian proceedings and brings Western Australia in line with most other Australian States and Territories. The Western Australian Government cited this, and \"the fact that litigation funding is now a modern reality and has the potential to improve access to justice when the costs to initiate an action are prohibitive\" in support of the move.\n\nInterestingly, Western Australia has not followed Victoria's lead in removing the prohibition on lawyers charging a contingency fee in class actions. A contingency fee is a method of billing for legal services through a percentage amount recovered in the litigation, and historically Australian lawyers have been prohibited from charging them. Victoria’s reforms allow a lead plaintiff to apply to the Court seeking that the legal costs be in the form of a contingency fee. It remains to be seen whether the WA Parliament would seek to introduce similar reform in the future, or as part of the five-year review of the new regime.",

    "Mega-polluting coal plans clash with Australia’s climate goals": "The future of the country’s $63 billion coal export industry is a dilemma for Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who took office in May with a promise to improve a weak record on climate action. Though his government has tightened emissions reduction targets, Albanese has also signaled support for new gas and coal developments amid a global energy crisis that’s seen buyers scramble for the country’s exports and swelled profits for fossil-fuel producers.\n\nGlobal electricity generation from coal jumped about 8.5% last year to more than 9,600 terawatt-hours, the first increase since 2018, according to data compiled by BloombergNEF. Climate groups have raised concerns over the potential impact on efforts to curb emissions as nations revert to using the dirtiest fossil fuel.\n\nAlbanese’s government “is talking the talk that Australia is back on climate, but it’s got all these coal mines that are under review,” said Fahimah Badrulhisham, a spokesperson for Move Beyond Coal, the campaign group that produced the data. “We cannot allow new mines to be dug in 2022.”\n\nMinisters currently have no legal obligation to consider climate impacts when authorizing development of new mines, and campaigners in March lost an attempt to block a Whitehaven Coal Ltd. proposal over its projected emissions. Members of Australia’s Green Party and pro-climate independent lawmakers have called for existing environmental laws to be tightened.\n\nEnvironment Minister Tanya Plibersek is reviewing current laws, her office said. Coal mine applications are being assessed on a “case-by-case” basis, she said in July. Mining tycoon Clive Palmer was refused approvals in August for a the Central Queensland Coal project over the potential impact on the Great Barrier Reef.\n\nMining giants including BHP Group, Glencore Plc, and Peabody Energy Corp. are among producers with projects in Australia being considered by the government. BHP and Mitsubishi Corp.’s proposed Blackwater South metallurgical coal mine in Queensland is seeking approvals to cover a 90 year lifespan. That would equate to 1.98 billion tons of emissions, according to Move Beyond Coal’s estimates.\n\nBHP declined to comment on the emissions forecast. Chief Executive Officer Mike Henry previously suggested the mine would be unlikely to operate for the duration set out in approval documents.\n\nGlencore’s Valeria thermal and metallurgical coal mine in central Queensland has a proposed lifetime of 35 years and would emit 1.39 billion tons of carbon dioxide, Move Beyond Coal said.\n\nThe release of 17 billion tons of carbon dioxide from all the proposed mines would account for 4% of the world’s remaining “carbon budget” of 420 million tons — the point at which planetary warming of 1.5 degree Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) becomes the most likely scenario, according to the Global Carbon Project.\n\nA total of 31 coal mine projects were at the committed stage, where a final investment decision has been taken, or undergoing feasibility studies, Australia’s resources ministry said in a report in December.\n\n(By James Fernyhough, with assistance from Andrew Janes)",

    "Legislating net zero - the key implications of Australia’s Climate Change Act": "Three key implications for Australian businesses 5 min read\n\nClimate legislation introduced by the Government to implement Australia's net-zero commitments received assent on 13 September. On 14 September, the Climate Change Act 2022 (Cth) (Climate Act) and the Climate Change (Consequential Amendments) Act 2022 (Cth) (Consequential Amendments Act) commenced.\n\nWhile the Climate Act may appear symbolic in nature, it establishes a new policy platform and could have implications for the proponents of new projects in the resources and transport sectors in Australia. In this Insight, we summarise the Act and its key implications for Australian businesses.\n\nAt a glance The Climate Act and corresponding consequential amendments legislation came into effect on 14 September 2022.\n\nThe Act operates as 'umbrella' legislation to implement Australia's net-zero commitments and codifies Australia's net 2030 and 2050 GHG emissions reductions targets under the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe Act establishes that the 2030 GHG emissions reduction target is to be implemented as both a point target and an emissions budget, calculated using a straight-line trajectory which takes a linear decrease from 2020 to 2030. The 'emissions budget' approach gives the Government greater flexibility in implementing reforms up to 2030.\n\nThe Act itself does not impose obligations directly on companies, but its passage into law sets the scene for sector-based reforms to implement the 2030 target and emissions budget, which will impact businesses. Further details will continue to emerge as the Government refines its policy approach. The Safeguard Mechanism reforms, which will apply principally to the industrial and resources sectors, is one such measure.\n\nA look at the Act\n\nLegislated targets\n\nFor the first time, Australia will have legislated, economy-wide emissions reduction targets of:\n\nreducing net GHG emissions to 43% below 2005 levels by 2030; and\n\nreducing net GHG emissions to zero by 2050.\n\nImportantly, the 2030 GHG emissions reduction target is to be implemented as an emissions budget covering the period of 2021 to 2030, in addition to being assessed as a point target. The targets are to be interpreted consistently with both the Paris Agreement and Australia's formal Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) submitted on 16 June this year. The Act also includes a 'floor' in that a new or adjusted NDC must be a more ambitious target than the NDC immediately preceding it.\n\nClimate reports\n\nThe emissions reduction target is coupled with a new accountability regime to track progress against the targets.\n\nUnder the Climate Act, the Minister for Climate Change and Energy is required to prepare and table an annual climate change statement, having regard to advice from the Climate Change Authority. The Minister's statement is required to address a number of matters, including (among other things) Australia's progress towards achieving the GHG reduction targets, the effectiveness of federal and state policies to achieve the targets and risks to Australia from climate change impacts.\n\nThe Climate Change Authority is also required, at least once every five years, to advise the Minister on the targets it considers should be included in an NDC. The advice must also include (among other things) advice on the social, employment and economic benefits of any new or adjusted targets and the physical impacts of climate change on Australia.\n\nThe Climate Act provides for periodic reviews of the Act, the first occurring in five years and subsequent reviews occurring within 10 years after completion of the previous review.\n\nWhat does this mean for Australian businesses?\n\nThe Climate Change Act has three key implications for Australian businesses: as a guide to new policy, in flow-through legislative changes and on future project approvals.\n\nA guide to new policy\n\nAs a legislated requirement for the Government, the emissions target will play a substantial role in new and updated government policy development. Aided by annual progress reports by the Climate Change Authority, it is likely that policymakers will take care to ensure they can explain how policy changes assist (or at least do not prevent) Australia from achieving its emissions targets.\n\nFlow-through legislation\n\nThe Climate Act is supported by important 'flow-through' changes set out in the Consequential Amendments Act, which embeds Australia's GHG emissions reduction targets and the Paris Agreement into existing federal legislation. The Consequential Amendments Act does this by including the GHG emissions reduction targets into the objectives and functions of a number of federal agencies such as the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, Infrastructure Australia, Export Finance Australia, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Climate Change Authority.1\n\nAs a result, decisions taken by these bodies must now take into account the impact on Australia's emissions targets, which will give significant financial clout to the Paris commitments.\n\nImpacts on new projects\n\nCurrently, the Minister for the Environment and Water (Environment Minister) is not required to consider climate change impacts in her decision regarding whether or not to approve the taking of a controlled action under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act). While the Climate Act and the Consequential Amendments Act do not amend the core environmental approval framework under the EPBC Act, it is now open to the Environment Minister to have regard to the emissions budget and targets in the Climate Act.\n\nCase studies\n\nIn considering whether an increase in strategic litigation will result from the implementation of the emissions budget and GHG reduction targets in the Climate Act, learnings can be drawn from the Victorian Climate Change Act 2017 and the UK Climate Change Act 2008.\n\nVictorian Climate Change Act 2017\n\nUK Climate Change Act 2008 Victorian Climate Change Act 2017 Under the Victorian Climate Change Act 2017, climate change considerations are embedded into government decision-making. The Victorian Act has been used most notably by a not-for-profit environmental organisation, Environment Victoria, in alleging that the Environment Protection Authority of Victoria failed to properly consider climate change when reviewing operating licences of three Victorian coal-fired power plants. This case is still pending. UK Climate Change Act 2008 The UK Climate Change Act sets a long-term emissions reduction target of net zero by 2050 (based on 1990 baseline levels). Notably, in the case of R (on the application of Friends of the Earth Ltd and others) v Heathrow Airport Ltd2 (Heathrow), applicants alleged that the relevant decision-maker had breached his duty of care in failing to take into account the Paris Agreement when developing a national policy framework. While the relevant legislation imposed a duty to consider climate-related matters, this case illustrates the increasing trend for applicants to include climate-target arguments in their legal challenges.\n\nIn our view, the line of argument adopted by the applicants in the Environment Victoria and Heathrow cases would not be available in respect of an EPBC Act decision. Primarily, this is because in the Victorian and UK settings the relevant decision-makers were subject to a mandatory duty to consider certain matters relating to climate change and the Paris Agreement. Under the EPBC Act, this basket of considerations is discretionary.\n\nProponents of new projects in Australia should expect a suite of future policy and legislative measures in this area to implement the targets set out in the Climate Act. Already-announced measures include the 'Safeguard Mechanism' reforms, which seek to more heavily regulate large-scale emitters in the industrial and resource sectors, and the Rewiring the Nation policy which intends to modernise the energy grid.\n\nIt is not yet clear what measures will be taken in the transport, property, agricultural and other sectors. However, a sector-based approach will likely be employed to satisfy the newly implemented national targets.",

    "Australia defeat Serbian rivals": "The Seven Consulting Opals have recorded back-to-back victories with a strong defensive performance over a tough Serbian side.\n\nA pumped-up Australian side displayed some of their best basketball of the tournament in front of 9,329 vocal fans at Sydney SuperDome, to take a reassuring 69-54 win over Serbia.\n\nAustralia’s Bec Allen led the way with a player of the match performance posting 16 points, five rebounds, two steals and two huge blocks. Marianna Tolo started her first game of the tournament to finish with 12 points. Serbia’s Yvonne Anderson was on fire in the first half with 14 points, finishing with 16 and seven rebounds, six assists and two steals.\n\nIn the first half, Australia showed grit and intent, forcing Serbia into six-shot clock violations and found their flow at both ends of the floor.\n\nAs the Australians continued to limit Anderson’s attempts, Serbia struggled to score throughout the second half under the smothering defence.\n\nThe Seven Consulting Opals finished with four players in double digits; Lauren Jackson not far behind on nine points. In the final minutes of the game, Allen left the court with injury in the only blow to an impressive Seven Consulting Opals outing.\n\nSteph Talbot was pleased to see Australia take a win over the strong Serbian side, having gone down to them in the February Qualifying Tournament.\n\n“I think we came out and wanted to make a stance on how we want to play and how we want to play the rest of this tournament”, said Talbot. “We did that in the first half where they had a handful of 24-second shot clock violations and that’s how we want to play. We need to take that forward into the next game.”\n\nSeven Consulting Opals’ Head Coach Sandy Brondello praised Talbot for leading the team defensively.\n\n“Steph did a really good job on Anderson,” said Brondello. “It’s good that she stayed on court today. She is one of the best defenders no matter where she plays. She is our defensive anchor, and it really starts with her and her energy. Serbia has a good team and holding them to 54 points is a good effort.”\n\nDisappointed about Allen’s potential rib injury, Brondello added: “I think she got crushed and got hit, it would be really unfortunate if she doesn’t play.”\n\nSerbian Head Coach Marina Maljkovic knows her side has more work to do to go further into the tournament.\n\n“We had some very nice moments coming from our young and experienced players, but we also had a lot of mistakes,” said Maljkovic. “We have yet to reach the point where we play for 40 minutes, and we must do that in the next two games. We will do the best we can. In this type of tournament, you must think from game to game.”\n\nMaljkovic also noted the impact of the intense schedule on all players at the tournament.\n\n“The schedule this year is very complicated,” Maljkovic noted. “The quality is great basketball, that’s why I feel sad. That we can’t see players at their best at the moment because of a very tight schedule.”\n\nSTATISTICS:\n\nAUSTRALIA SERBIA 1st quarter 18 10 2nd quarter 36 28 3rd quarter 53 43 Full time 69 54\n\nAUSTRALIA:\n\nPlayer Pts Reb Ast Stl Bec ALLEN 16 5 2 2 Marianna TOLO 12 2 5 3 Steph TALBOT 10 6 2 2\n\nSERBIA:",

    "Pull your weight: Australia’s biggest polluters on notice": "It’s time to end the free ride for Australia’s biggest polluters, with the Climate Council issuing a direct challenge to the country’s worst offenders to clean up their acts.\n\nAs the Labor Government draws up plans for reforming a regulation that’s supposed to be reducing pollution (known as the Safeguard Mechanism) the Climate Council has personally written to the CEOs of Australia’s 10 biggest industrial polluters – including Rio Tinto, Chevron, Woodside and Santos – asking for real cuts to their emissions every single year to 2030.\n\nIn Australia, just 10 companies account for more than half of all the harmful emissions produced under the Safeguard Mechanism, according to new analysis from the Australian Conservation Foundation. Together, these companies have pumped out over 362 million tonnes of harmful pollution since the scheme started in 2016 – equivalent to the CO2 produced by more than 16 million Australians in a single year.\n\nClimate Council CEO Amanda McKenzie says the Safeguard Mechanism is the most important climate policy you’ve probably never heard of, and it’s time to call it what it really is: a Pollution Speed Limit on Australia’s biggest emitters.\n\n“The way the laws are currently set-up allows our biggest polluters to keep polluting as much as they like. If they happen to go over the very generous thresholds that are set, then they can buy some cheap offsets and carry on polluting. This has to change.\n\n“Every one of these major corporate polluters publicly claims to be committed to reaching net zero. Those pledges to their shareholders, the financial markets and the Australian public mean nothing unless they are backed up with real cuts to emissions.\n\n“We directly challenge the CEOs of these companies to publicly commit their firms to make real cuts to emissions each year to 2030 – not greenwashing with cuts only recorded on paper using dodgy offsets.\n\n“We have a narrow window this decade to avoid the worst climate impacts. The only way to do this is to cut emissions, so the time for pollution-as-usual is over.\n\n“Australian households, small businesses and other parts of our local economy are stepping up to get us towards net zero. It’s time for big polluters to start pulling their weight in this national transformation.”\n\nTo ensure the Safeguard Mechanism becomes a genuine lever for driving down Australia’s emissions, the upcoming redesign of this regulation must achieve three things:\n\nAustralia’s biggest corporate polluters make absolute cuts to their emissions. This cannot be just another case of clever accounting that lets companies keep polluting as usual by hiding behind offsets. Australia’s biggest corporate polluters must pull their weight in reducing national emissions. Facilities within the scheme should reduce their emissions in line with the effort needed to reach Australia’s national emissions target. Australia’s biggest corporate polluters must start cutting emissions from day one. From 2023, when the new Safeguard Mechanism is in place, polluters should be subject to tough limits on how much they can emit. These limits should be lowered year on year to ensure Australia can reach or exceed its 2030 emissions reduction target.\n\nRead the Climate Council’s full submission to the Australian Government on reforming the Safeguard Mechanism here.\n\nFor interviews please contact Brianna Hudson on 0455 238 875 or Jane Gardner on 0438 130 905.\n\nThe Climate Council is Australia’s leading community-funded climate change communications organisation.

    "Kohli and Yadav steer India to T20 series win over Australia": "Virat Kohli and Suryakumar Yadav scored sublime half-centuries to give India a six-wicket win and series victory over Australia in the third and final T20I in Hyderabad.\n\nQuickfire innings from the opener Cameron Green (52 off 21 balls) and Tim David (54 off 27) set up a score of 186 for seven for Australia on Sunday after they lost the toss.\n\nIndia, the No 1-ranked side in the world, lost their openers inside the first four overs, but a third-wicket stand of 104 between Kohli (63 off 48) and Suryakumar Yadav (69 off 36) gave them the initiative.\n\nNeeding 11 off the final over, bowled by Daniel Sams (2-33 off 2.5 overs), Kohli blasted a six over long on but was caught at extra cover off the next delivery.\n\nOnly one came off the next two balls but Hardik Pandya (25 not out off 16) edged the fifth delivery outside off stump to the boundary to secure the win.\n\nKohli middled the ball well from the start of his innings, producing a couple of sumptuous cover driven boundaries.\n\nHe then took a back seat as Yadav bullied the Australia attack, smashing five fours and five sixes.\n\nKohli had a life on 23 when leg spinner Adam Zampa spilled a sharp return catch\n\nYadav played shots around the wicket, bringing up his half century with a wristy six over long on off Zampa and blasting another maximum over cover of the spinner’s next delivery.\n\nGreen, who also impressed with the ball, conceding just 14 from his three overs, stuck seven fours and three sixes, two of them off successive deliveries from Jasprit Bumrah.\n\nHe dominated the early stages of the Australian innings, scoring all but 10 of their runs before he was dismissed off the final ball off the fifth over.\n\nHowever, he was the only one of Australia’s top four to reach double figures with Aaron Finch (seven), Glenn Maxwell (six) Steve Smith (nine) all falling cheaply as the visitors slipped to 84 for four in the 10th over.\n\nDavid provided much needed momentum in the later overs, combining with Sams (28 not out off 20) for a seventh-wicket stand of 68, after Australia slumped to 117 for six.\n\nSign up to The Spin Free weekly newsletter Subscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s action Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He struck twice in the 14th over, having Josh Inglis (24 off 22) caught at backward point and then taking a smart low return catch to dismiss in-form Matthew Wade for just a single.\n\nThe leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal (one for 22 off four) also did good job of putting the brakes on Australia before David and Sams lifted the tempo.\n\nAustralia will play two T20I matches in early October against West Indies, on the Gold Coast and in Brisbane, before the World Cup later that month.",
    "Awkward Green dilemma selectors should’ve seen coming as WC wildcard ignites: Burning questions": "The World Cup has edged that bit closer with another T20 series in the books — one which Australia lost 2-1 after India came from behind to win with just one ball remaining.\n\nLosing in India weeks before the World Cup isn’t likely to trigger any genuine alarm bells for Australia, particularly with home series against West Indies and England up next.\n\nNonetheless, the series has given rise to a number of selection considerations that Australia will need clarity on before the opening match of the tournament.\n\nThese are the Burning Questions after Australia’s 2-1 series loss to India.\n\nWatch Australia v West Indies. Every T20 Live & Exclusive to Fox Sports on Kayo. New to Kayo? Start your free trial now >\n\nCAN CAMERON GREEN BE ADDED TO WC SQUAD... AND SHOULD HE BE?\n\nYes, he can.\n\nAll teams have until October 9 to make changes to their squads without the approval of the event’s Technical Committee, while Super 12 teams — of which Australia is one — have until October 15.\n\nAfter that deadline, Green could still easily be added to the squad as a late injury replacement.\n\nWhether he should is going to be the question on the lips of many over the coming days.\n\nThe 23-year-old was arguably Australia’s best player of the three-match series, averaging 39.33 with the bat while hitting at the mighty strike rate of 214.54.\n\nHe did so despite it being the first time he’s opened the batting in international cricket.\n\nGreen made two half-centuries while he also eventually impressed with the ball after a sluggish start.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nRATINGS: X-factor’s ominous warning as Maxwell disaster leaves big WC question\n\nTHIRD T20: Aussie T20 heartbreak as India strike knockout blow with one ball left\n\nIn the series’ deciding match, he was hit for just 4.66 runs-an-over while no other Australian conceded less than 8.50. Yuzvendra Chahal was the only other bowler in the entire match to go for less than 7.50 runs-an-over.\n\nOf course, all the usual cricket caveats apply. This was a series in India, not Australia, where the World Cup will be played in vastly different conditions.\n\nFurthermore, this was a series that favoured the batters with plenty of big totals across the board.\n\nNonetheless, it’s hard to imagine that if selectors were picking Australia’s squad now, and not four weeks ago, Green wouldn’t be included.\n\nAt the time, Green had only played one T20I, and was yet to post unbeaten scores of 89 and 25 in the ODI series against New Zealand.\n\nGiven his precocious talent, this is now a selection conundrum that we probably should’ve seen coming.\n\nEven if Green wasn’t to be shoehorned into Australia’s XI, his spot as a squad member now feels like a no-brainer.\n\nHe can bat virtually anywhere in the order, he bowls, and is an exceptional fielder.\n\nAustralia now returns to play two series against the West Indies and England at home before the World Cup starts.\n\nAs things stand, Green is not even a part of the squad for those series with David Warner returning after skipping the tour of India.\n\nTime will tell if selectors are willing to shake up their plans to give Green a final look in Australian conditions.\n\nIf nothing else, it might’ve been a million-dollar performance from Green anyway.\n\nGreen blasting runs from the top of the order in Indian conditions will not go unnoticed by franchise owners in the Indian Premier League.\n\nHis value could be immense come next year’s IPL auction.\n\nWAS TIM DAVID WORTH THE WAIT?\n\nFew white ball players have garnered more hype before even playing a game for Australia than Tim David.\n\nAs such, he had plenty to live up to in India where his debut series didn’t hit the lofty heights that many were expecting.\n\nNonetheless, he ended the series on the right note with a timely reminder of why he’s been added to Australia’s World Cup squad.\n\nThe big-hitter blasted 54 runs in a 27-ball innings that included four sixes and two fours. His runs came at a crucial time, too, with Australia wobbling at 4-84 after 9.2 overs.\n\nIt comes to the surprise of no one — he’s been blasting runs against quality bowlers in T20 leagues across the world — but David is undoubtedly up to international standard.\n\nWhether he cracks into Australia’s XI at the World Cup could come down to performances in the series against the West Indies and England.\n\nDavid has been a run machine in 2022 but many of his runs have come playing in Pakistan and India in their respective domestic T20 leagues.\n\nReplicating that in Australia could be the final box for David to tick to force selectors into tweaking the team’s batting order.\n\nAs for where David could fit in, the options are emerging (see below).\n\nSHOULD GLENN MAXWELL BE A LOCK?\n\nProbably not.\n\nTrue that Maxwell’s extra risk-taking has made him a soft target in the past, while talk of him underperforming for Australia is somewhat overblown.\n\nAfter all, this is a two-time World Cup winner averaging 29.33 in T20Is and 34.13 in ODIs, while he strikes at over 150 in the former.\n\nBut Maxwell’s form has been patchy-to-poor in recent times and, while his potential is extraordinary, no player should be a lock on promise alone.\n\nWhich brings us to here: Maxwell just averaged 2.33 across three innings, and faced only 15 balls all series.\n\nHe averages 25.41 across both white ball formats in 2022, although that number is somewhat inflated by unbeaten scores of 48 and 80 against Sri Lanka in the first half of the year.\n\nSince the start of last month’s ODI series against Zimbabwe, Maxwell’s average slips to 14.14.\n\nHe was also a quiet performer for Australia at last year’s World Cup, averaging 16.00 while striking at a run-a-ball. Only bowlers Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins and Adam Zampa averaged less for Australia.\n\nThe India series doesn’t suddenly place Maxwell on the chopping block, especially given he’s a tidy bowler and an outstanding fielder — neither of which should be understated.\n\nNonetheless, the emergence of David means he shouldn’t be considered safe either.\n\nWHAT ABOUT STEVE SMITH?\n\nIn a similar boat to Maxwell is Smith, who will also be looking over his shoulder.\n\nSmith’s value as a T20 player has been debated in recent times with some of the world’s most dangerous sides snubbing the ‘anchor’ role.\n\nWith David waiting for his chance, Smith’s name has been thrown up as the player who could come out of Australia’s top seven to make it more aggressive, and to follow the lead of more explosive teams.\n\nFormer selector Mark Waugh is among those who believe David should be squeezed into Australia’s XI at the World Cup, saying earlier this month: “I’ve got him in the team. I would start with him.\n\n“I’ve got him in which means another player would miss out who’d be unlucky but yeah, I’d like to see him in there.”\n\nAsked who could make way, Waugh said: “Well you’ve got (Marcus) Stoinis or Steve Smith potentially.”\n\nStoinis missed the tour of India with injury and has also been out of form, making ODI scores of 19, 3, 5 and 0 against Zimbabwe and New Zealand.\n\nHe did, however, average 80.00 at last year’s World Cup with a strike rate of 137.93 — and is still considered a dangerous weapon in the Australian middle-order.\n\nSmith was in great ODI form earlier this month, while he started the series against India with 35 runs off 24 balls. He ended the series, however, with scores of eight and nine to reinvite some of the pressure around his position.\n\nLike Maxwell, he’s sure to heavily feature in home series against the West Indies and England. He will need to perform in those to put the debate to rest.\n\nSteve Smith is still under some pressure. Source: AFP\n\nDO WE STILL NEED TO WORRY ABOUT AARON FINCH?\n\nSome of the heat around Aaron Finch has died down with a switch to the 20-over game — but he’s not in the clear yet.\n\nThe opener made some important runs in India, but his scores of 22, 31 and seven aren’t enough to say he’s put his form troubles to bed.\n\nFinch endured a dire ODI run this year that saw him retire from the format so Australia can prepare a replacement for next year’s 50-over World Cup.\n\nAt the time, Finch said that while he was out-of-sorts in ODI cricket, he had no concerns about making runs in the 20-over game.\n\nWhether he believed that or not only he knows, but it should be said that opening the batting in 20-over cricket and 50-over cricket in 2022 is fundamentally very similar.\n\nMeanwhile, the conditions in India were friendly towards the batters which would have offered Finch an extra helping hand.\n\nIn Australia, with a little more bounce and some extra movement in the first few overs, Finch’s technique will be put to the test.\n\nAs such, it’s simply too early to say if Finch is truly out of his funk.",

Over the next decade, Australia’s old-age dependency ratio (the ratio of people aged 65 and over to the working-age population) will change from about four workers to three workers for every retiree.\n\nLower tax receipts and higher spending on pensions, health and aged care may cost around $40bn every year (about 8% of the budget).\n\nGiven concerns about debt levels and budget repair, government revenues must better align with outlays if Australians want continuation of expected benefits, cost-of-living relief and expenditure on ameliorating the rising costs of more frequent climate change induced weather events.\n\nAustralia’s overall taxation level at 28% of GDP is below the OECD average of 34% and at least 10%% less than that of Germany, France and Scandinavia.\n\nAddressing the tax take and how it is raised is a pressing issue.\n\nAustralia’s tax base is narrow, dependent on personal income taxes which at 42% of all federal tax revenues is also below the OECD average of 49%, after adjustment for social security payments which many countries levy to fund unemployment support, age and disability pensions.\n\nGiven Australia’s reasonably progressive tax scale and a highest marginal tax rate of 47% (including the Medicare levy), scope for increases is limited if the country wishes to attract and retain skilled talent.\n\nCorporate taxes (about 17% v the OECD average of 10%) are difficult to increase because of Australia’s industrial structure and high overseas ownership of businesses (about 79%) with earnings accruing overseas.\n\nA side-effect of globalisation and Australia’s open economy is that personal and corporate income tax increases need to stay globally competitive in what is increasingly a race to the bottom. This may make increased consumption and wealth taxes unavoidable.\n\nAustralia’s GST, at about 12% of total tax revenue, is below the OECD average of 20%. Increases in the rate and coverage are one alternative.\n\nAs at March 2022, total Australian household wealth reached $14.9tn ($574,807 a person). Since March 2020, it has risen 35%, due to increases in residential property values (up 40%) and superannuation balances (up 22%). Since the abolition of death duties in 1979, this wealth accrues largely tax free except for concessional capital gains imposts.\n\nWhere to raise more taxes?\n\nOptions include revising the capital gains tax regime and introducing inheritance taxes – Australia is one of few countries that does not tax bequests.\n\nUltimately, primary residences and superannuation balances will need to be taxed or applied against post-work aged care and healthcare expenses. Wealthier Australians cannot continue to use their homes and superannuation as a tax-advantaged savings vehicle with the capital preserved at death for beneficiaries.\n\nIrregularities and anomalies need to be reduced.\n\nGovernment support must be targeted to ensure intended recipients benefit.\n\nAustralia’s childcare subsidies, for example, are available to families with income up to $356,756. Frequently distortionary, regressive and expensive concessions for investment in equipment that would be bought anyway, dividends, capital gains, superannuation and property must be reconsidered.\n\nSimplification of Australia’s complex tax code of tens of thousands of pages is essential. It enables legal structuring of affairs to minimise tax liabilities. A simpler principle rather than detailed rule-based system and allowing retrospective penalties, where the legislative policy or intent is ignored, would reduce tax planning opportunities.\n\nBut significant tax changes in Australia are difficult.\n\nWill Labor make the move?\n\nThe GST, ultimately introduced by stealth, took decades. The ALP attributes its loss at the 2019 election to modest proposed alterations to taxation of dividends and negative gearing, since abandoned.\n\nUnwilling to attempt serious tax reform, governments rely instead on bracket creep – increased tax revenue from rising nominal incomes due to inflation which put taxpayers into higher tax categories. This has pushed up the average personal income tax rate from 24% in 2016-17 to about 27% now. Inflation indexing thresholds would force governments to be transparent about tax revenues. Understandably, it faces bipartisan opposition.\n\nComplexity facilitates pork barrel politics with governments tweaking concessions and provisions to placate different constituencies.\n\nA large tax advice industry of questionable productive value resists simplification as an existential threat. Voters are likely to reject proposals that adversely affect them financially.\n\n\n\nWithout radical tax reform, Australia faces an insoluble public finance problem – demand for spending which cannot be met by taxes. The only other course of action is to wind back the country’s cherished welfare net.\n\nAs the old pre-metric saying goes: “You can’t get quarts out of pint pots.”",

The ASX 200 eventually closed down 105 points or 1.6% to 6,469. By 4:15pm AEST, the Australian dollar was down at 64.92 US cents.\n\nEnergy and mining stocks were the biggest losers, with Woodside Energy and Santos down 5% and 7.3%, respectively and mining giants BHP and Rio Tinto dropping 5.2% and 5.6%.\n\nThe slump comes as global investors brace for more instability, with the ongoing market volatility creating investor distrust and widespread uncertainty.\n\nLast Friday, the British Pound hit an all-time low when Prime Minister Liz Truss announced the largest tax cuts since 1972.\n\nThe announcement came during the UK’s new Chancellor of the Exchequer Kwasi Kwartend ‘mini budget’, which outlined the tax cuts and spending measures the British government believes will boost long term growth, instead of favouring short-term market moves.\n\nBut with critics concerned that such moves will solely benefit the wealthy, many believe the announcement is what undermined investor confidence in the UK market.\n\nThis withdrawal of confidence saw the pound plunge nearly 5% at one point, down to US$1.0372: the lowest price since Britain went decimal in 1971 and almost at parity with the US dollar.\n\nIt’s far from smooth sailing in the US, either, with the Dow entering treacherous bear market territory.\n\nJust last week US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell raised rates by 0.75% for the third consecutive time in a bid to tackle inflation.\n\nThese rate levels have not been seen since the GFC, yet Powell confirmed further hikes would continue before the year’s end.\n\nDespite the turbulence–and the many opposing views–Powell remains convinced that a global recession isn’t on the cards since “… there are too many areas of the economy that are performing too well”.\n\nAustralian Opposition Leader, Peter Dutton, is among those in disagreement, warning Treasurer Jim Chalmers and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to not take any missteps ahead of next month’s budget.\n\n“There’s general agreement with the commentators and economists on the US going into recession, and the UK is likely to go into recession to say the least,” Mr Dutton said.\n\n“In my judgement, we won’t have a recession here unless Labor really, really stuffs up,” he said.",

    "Is Australia’s Reserve Bank bankrupt?": "Australia’s Reserve Bank has just reported a loss of A$37 billion (US$24.1 billion), the biggest in its history, and it says it will be unable to pay the government dividends for some time.\n\nThe announcement followed a review of its bond-buying program, one of the most important ways it supported the economy during the first two years of the pandemic.\n\nIn order to borrow to fund programs such as JobKeeper, the government borrowed on the bond market, issuing bonds on the money market that the Reserve Bank later bought with newly created money. That meant the Reserve Bank was, indirectly, the largest financier of the expanded budget deficit.\n\nThe review concluded the bond-buying program worked relatively well. By aggressively buying A$281 billion of bonds, the Reserve Bank was able to not only make sure government programs were funded but also lower the general level of interest rates in the bond market, supporting the economy.\n\nHow did buying bonds help?\n\nThe review found buying bonds on the money market\n\nencouraged traders to put their money into other parts of the economy, such as investing in Australian firms\n\nsent a signal to the market that interest rates would be low for a long time, encouraging firms to invest, confident they will be able to borrow cheaply for years to come\n\ngave investors confidence that, if they bought bonds, they could sell them later to the bank if needed.\n\nThe report suggests the A$281 billion dollars of bond purchases lowered long-term bond rates by around 0.3 percentage points.\n\nThis in turn helped lower the value of the Australian dollar by 1-2%, supported business investment, and encouraged consumers to spend, and boosted gross domestic product by a cumulative A$25 billion.\n\nWhat about the downsides?\n\nThe report found the Reserve Bank made a substantial loss on the bond-buying program, estimated to be as high as A$54 billion. Its overall loss this financial year will approach A$37 billion.\n\nHow can a bank make a loss when it is printing money?\n\nThe answer is that it lost money by buying high and selling low – the opposite of traditional investment advice!\n\nDuring the crisis investors fled to the safety of the Australian bond market, wanting to put their money somewhere safe: Australian government bonds.\n\nThis meant the bank bought bonds at high prices. As the economy recovered and investors plowed their money back into the stock market and other more risky places, bond prices dropped, giving the bank an accounting loss on the bonds.\n\nWhile the Reserve Bank doesn’t plan to sell the bonds (it’ll hold them until they mature), if it did, it would have to sell them for much less.\n\nBankrupt? Not really\n\nThe bank is still perfectly capable of operating even if it loses money on investments. Being able to print money at will means it can’t go broke.\n\nBut it is unlikely to provide the government with a dividend from its profits for several years. Usually, the bank makes a profit from printing money. The notes cost about 32 Australian cents each to print and it offloads them for as much as A$50 and A$100.\n\nIt will use this income to soak up the losses from its bond-buying program, and won’t need to ask the government for more.\n\nThis review confirms that bond-buying will remain an important part of the bank’s toolkit. While inflation today is soaring and interest rates are being increased at a breakneck pace, it is highly likely that at some point in the future the economy will go through a rough patch and need lower rates.\n\nWhen the bank has cut its short-term cash rate to near-zero, as it did in 2020, it’ll need to do something else to bring down other longer-term rates.\n\nIt says it will buy bonds only “in extreme circumstances, when the usual monetary policy tool – the cash rate target – has been employed to the full extent possible”, but it concedes it may have to, and it believes what it did was worthwhile.`\n\nIsaac Gross, Lecturer in Economics, Monash University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Source: AFP\n\nAARON FINCH — 6\n\n60 runs at 20.00, SR 176.47, HS 31\n\nA return to form of sorts for Finch. By no means did the Australian put up big numbers, but scores of 22 and 31 in the first two matches will allay some fears heading into the World Cup.\n\nCAMERON GREEN — 9\n\n118 runs at 39.33, SR 214.54, HS 61\n\nOne wicket at 60.00, economy 10.00, BBI 1-46\n\nAn outstanding series from the young all-rounder, opening the batting for the first time in his international career. The position fit him like a glove with two blistering half centuries in three innings. He was expensive with the ball in game one, but turned it around for game three when he was hit for just 4.66 runs an over. No other Australian was hit for less than eight an over in the match. Australia’s player of the series — and it’s not too late for him to be added to the World Cup squad.\n\nSTEVE SMITH — 4\n\n52 runs at 17.33, SR 133.33, HS 35\n\nNot much joy for the right-hander who started the series well with 35 runs off 24 balls. He was down the order in game two and was runout after just five balls, while he missed out in the final match with just nie runs off 10 balls. There will no doubt be considerations about how Tim David could fit into Australia’s XI, and Smith might not be safe.\n\nTIM DAVID — 7\n\n74 runs at 24.66, SR 168.18, HS 54\n\nHe left it late, but David showed in the last T20 why he had generated so much hype despite having never played for Australia before the series. After a slow start with scores of 18 and 2, David ignited in the decider with 54 runs off just 27 balls. He came to the crease with Australia stuttering at 5-115 after 13.1 overs and took the visitors to a total that so nearly won it all. He’s certainly a strong contender to retain his spot come the T20 World Cup.\n\nGLENN MAXWELL — 1\n\n7 runs at 2.33, SR 46.66, HS 6\n\nNo wickets, economy 10.50\n\nNot much you can say here, really. Copped an unlucky runout in the final match just to add the salt into the wounds. He faced just 15 balls across three matches which says it all. Only bowled the two overs. A one feels harsh, but it’s hard to find where more points can come from. A series to forget.\n\nMATTHEW WADE — 8.5\n\n89 runs at 89.00, SR 202.27, HS 45*\n\nTo think Australia looked for so long for a finisher. Wade’s value in the middle-lower order is immense, as he showed once more in the first two matches. He made 45 off 21 in the first T20, followed by 43 off 20 in the second. Missed out in the final match to end on a low note, but a strong performance from the veteran nonetheless.\n\nPAT CUMMINS — 3\n\nTwo wickets at 55.00, economy 11.00, BBI 1-23\n\nThe series was a tough grind for the bowlers, and that was no exception for Cummins. He was hit for 11 runs an over — but he had plenty of company.\n\nADAM ZAMPA — 4.5\n\nThree wickets at 32.00, economy 9.60, BBI 3-16\n\nWas brilliant in the second match trying to defend Australia’s 90 runs from eight overs. He had the visitors dreaming with his 3-16 which included the wicket of Virat Kohli... again. Nonetheless, he went wicketless in the other two matches and was particularly expensive in the last, going for 0-44.\n\nJOSH HAZLEWOOD — 4\n\nThree wickets at 33.00, economy 11.00, BBI 2-39\n\nWe’ve come to expect far better T20 numbers from Hazlewood, but this was a series geared towards the batters. Nonetheless, going for 20 runs off one over in the second T20 was awfully costly for Australia. He was expensive again in the final match, going for 1-40.\n\nJOSH INGLIS — 4\n\n41 runs at 20.50, SR 128.12, HS 24\n\nPlayed two matches in the series and while he didn’t make the most of his chances, he didn’t do his credentials much harm either. Provided some important quick runs in the first T20 with his 17 off 10 balls, but didn’t kick on in his final appearance with 24 runs off 22.\n\nDANIEL SAMS — 4\n\nTwo wickets at 26.50, economy 10.25, BBI 2-33\n\nBowled just 5.1 overs across the series. He was blasted in the second T20 but was among Australia’s better bowlers in the finale, taking two wickets while being hit for 8.60 runs an over. Almost pulled off a miracle escape for Australia, too, while trying to defend 11 runs in the final over. Deserves some credit for his unbeaten 28 off 20 balls in the same match.\n\nNATHAN ELLIS — N/A\n\nThree wickets at 10.00, economy 7.50, BBI 3-30\n\nEllis played just the one match but delivered arguably the best bowling performance of the series, taking 3-30 in the first match, which Australia won. From his four T20Is, Ellis now has 12 wickets at just 9.00.\n\nSEAN ABBOTT — N/A\n\nNo wickets, economy 11.00\n\nWas called on for just the one match, bowling just one over and not batting. Feels harsh to give him a rating, so we won’t.",
    "Australia T20Is: India's batting progresses, bowling regresses": "A hard-fought 2-1 series victory over defending champions Australia has reaffirmed that India’s aggressive batting approach under captain Rohit Sharma and coach Rahul Dravid remains on track. However, with less than a month to go for their T20 World Cup opener against Pakistan in Melbourne, the familiar bowling frailties have left them looking somewhat vulnerable.\n\nWith just three more games against South Africa left before India board the plane to Australia, we take a look at some talking points from their latest contest.\n\nTop-order roles\n\nWith India having retained the same old top order for the T20 World Cup, there is no point in questioning the choice of personnel for now.\n\nIt is more about who plays what role now; going by the Australian series, it appears that openers Rohit and KL Rahul will go hard in the Powerplay, with the assurance that they have the solidity of Virat Kohli to follow at No 3 should an early wicket fall (The all-or-nothing approach does not come naturally to either Rahul or Rohit, but as the team management has stated several times, comfort zones are what India are aiming to get out of).\n\n“That’s why I’m batting at 3, I have to utilise my experience and give the team what the team wants,” Kohli said after anchoring India to victory in the series decider in Hyderabad on Sunday with a 48-ball 63.\n\nKohli let the T20 genius of Suryakumar Yadav blossom during their century partnership but made sure to launch a few aerial boundaries either side of the stand.\n\nHowever, the boundaries dried up at the death, and that is the risk India carry if Kohli bats that long.\n\nHe can go into wild slogging mode at times when the big hits are needed, and that has never been his game. He’s spoken about focusing on timing the ball into the gaps instead, and that is what India will want him to stick to.\n\nSo, at the moment, Kohli seems to be a kind of flexible anchor, which is probably the best way to utilise him if he is not opening.\n\nBlunt bowling\n\nWhile the pieces of the batting puzzle have more or less come together, the bowling has had the old clueless look when put under the pump. Twice against the towering reach and power of Cameron Green, in Mohali and Hyderabad, India had nowhere to turn to until considerable damage had been caused.\n\nLoss of form and injury comebacks have combined to make their bowling attack appear weaker than it actually is.\n\nOn paper, Jasprit Bumrah, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Harshal Patel and Arshdeep Singh are a pretty competent Powerplay and death bowling unit. But Bhuvneshwar is having to bowl more at the death than he usually would in the absence of the unfit Arshdeep, and Bumrah and Harshal are only just feeling their way back in from injury layoffs.\n\nLike the composition of the top order, the debate over whether this is the best pace attack for Australian conditions will have to wait until after the T20 World Cup. Heading into the tournament, India can only hope the selected personnel are fit and firing.\n\nAnd whether the inclusion of more pace in the form of Mohammed Shami will add bite is up in the air, as the senior pacer hasn’t played a single T20I since the 2021 World Cup and is now out of action for some more time with Covid. In any case, pace can disappear faster than it arrives in this format.\n\nThe Axar poser\n\nEven when India failed to defend 208 in Mohali, Axar Patel returned 3 for 17. Time and again, he’s shown himself to be a better T20 bowler than his senior Ravindra Jadeja but then, he is nowhere near the allrounder as a batsman. And that is only aggravating the serious lack of depth in India’s batting line-up.\n\nOn a couple of occasions now, they have saved Dinesh Karthik for the death and promoted Axar, but that doesn’t have the same impact as Jadeja’s comfort with batting at No 5 or 6.\n\nAnd playing neither R Ashwin nor Deepak Chahar means that for all practical purposes, India’s batting ends with Karthik, further heaping pressure on his already difficult finishing job.\n\nContrast that with the threat of Pat Cummins striding out at No 9 for Australia. It is all well when at least one of the top four is batting like a dream, as Suryakumar did in Hyderabad, but over the course of a World Cup, it is very difficult to replicate in a fickle format.\n\nNot only does it leave no insurance in the event of a collapse, it also makes the specialists that much more circumspect. India have got to find a way to bring in some more batting capability at No 8.\n\nOnly one keeper\n\nThe inevitable has happened, given the combination India have chosen to play. There is room for only one wicketkeeper-batsman, and Rishabh Pant has made way for Karthik, who doubles up as the specialist finisher.\n\nAnd going by what Rohit said on Sunday, Pant will play only if India determine the opposition match-ups merit a left-hander. Once more, it is futile to lament what could have been had India decided to give Pant the opener a run. Convention and experience is what they have erred on the side of.\n\nFaltering in the field\n\nIt is not quite the famously fallible Indian fielding side of 2011 vintage, where MS Dhoni would lose count of how many men he had to hide on the outfield; but by modern T20 fielding standards, this Indian team is certainly below average.\n\nAlmost the entire bowling attack is more a liability than an asset on the field. And barring Kohli, none of the batsmen are what you’d call gun outfielders.\n\nIf they fell short in Mohali and Hyderabad, one can only imagine the headaches for Rohit on Australian grounds. Alas, as with the rest of his chosen options, he will have to live with what he has.",

ISIC provides the internationally accepted standard for categorizing business units within an economy, which allows for data comparison at the national and international levels.”\n\nThe ABS consultation seeks feedback on how industry classifications are currently used in Australia, key concerns with ANZSIC and implementation issues of a new industry classification.\n\nIt also aims to raise user awareness to key changes to revised ISIC as proposed by the United Nations Statistical Division, seeking feedback on whether the updated ISIC will meet Australian user’s requirements.\n\nMore detailed information outlining the scope of this program of work and time frames is available on the ABS Consultation Hub.\n\nConsultation will open on the 26 of September 2022.",
    "What global technology trends will bring for EVs in Australia": "Australia finds itself in a unique position when it comes to EV policy, infrastructure and uptake.\n\nAs other countries are ahead in this journey, we have the opportunity to learn from the successes and failures of others. And while policy may be one of the most critical elements to ensuring the success of the transition to EVs, innovation and technology are equally important.\n\nIf we take a step back and look for cues in other markets, there are four global technology trends that will play a role in Australia’s EV future.\n\nSmart charging\n\nSmart charging is an intelligent form of EV charging which optimises energy consumption. By enabling communication between a vehicle and the grid, charging can be automated to capitalise on cheaper electricity tariffs. It can also be used to restrict charging to minimise stress on the grid.\n\nIn Europe, high energy prices have seen smart charging technology grow rapidly. Ohme is a UK company, which has taken smart charging one step further, offering the option to charge when renewable energy generation on the grid is at its highest – helping to lower CO2 impact.\n\nIn Australia, companies including AGL and Origin are progressing at pace. In March AGL installed 200 EV smart chargers in homes as part of a trial. And more recently, Origin agreed to supply 100 per cent renewable power for an ARENA-funded project triallling on-street chargers for homes without parking facilities.\n\nAs more EVs connect to the grid, the domestic need for this technology is expected to grow. And over time it will become the standard charging technology for homes and businesses.\n\nArtificial intelligence\n\nBeyond self-driving vehicles, EV companies and manufacturers are still looking for ways to use AI effectively, but early research points to applications which may prove useful here.\n\nResearch by US company Volta is using machine learning to identify the optimal locations to place charging stations. The technology analyses data including EV adoption rates in areas, demand and expected utilisation. It also analyses demographics to predict infrastructure needs.\n\nResearchers from Idaho National Laboratory are using machine learning to reduce electric vehicle charging times. The scientists have discovered how to create new charging protocols which allow lithium-ion batteries to be charged to 90 per cent within ten minutes. These intelligent technologies will become increasingly important as the Australian Government rolls out its first National Electric Vehicle Strategy.\n\nHome and business integration\n\nAs more EVs come online in Australia, both homes and businesses – especially those that provide public charging stations – will see an increase in demand for electricity. This will require the integration of renewable energy to minimise energy costs and CO2 emissions, as well as increase energy supply.\n\nIntegrating solar panels into charge point power supply is one option. Another approach is to integrate battery storage.\n\nWe are likely to see both rolled out in Australia. In the US, EVgo is an early adopter of using batteries and smart energy management to provide a stable EV charging service. Power is fed into the batteries from the grid off peak, or from onsite renewables, and then released to charge EVs during peak times.\n\nCompanies in Australia are making moves in this space. For example. Chargefox’s ultra-rapid sites are backed by 100 per cent green power, which is also catering to an increasing demand from EV owners to reduce their emissions footprint. In many instances, they also add solar and batteries on site to enable charging via solar energy.\n\nIntegration makes clear business sense for Australian homes and companies and expectations among consumers to charge their vehicles using clean energy are expected to rise.\n\nBattery and vehicle design\n\nLithium-ion batteries are not ultra-efficient and research is underway to find better ways to power EVs. Cell-to-pack batteries are an innovation we can expect to hear more about.\n\nCell-to-pack refers to the direct integration of cells into a battery pack. Instead of flat packs of battery modules laying across the base of a car’s chassis, they can instead be integrated into it.\n\nThis design decreases the weight of the vehicle and can increase cabin space. The upside is quicker and less frequent charging and an increased driving range.\n\nChinese battery company CATL claims its latest iteration of this tech can deliver 13 per cent more power than Tesla’s latest cells. Leapmotor has developed a cell-to-chassis (CTC) battery technology. The CTC tech uses the car’s underbody as a battery box and then integrates the cells into the vehicle’s frame.\n\nSolid state batteries are another innovation close to being market ready. With the potential to reduce the carbon footprint of EV battiers up to 39 per cent, they are expected to be in production from 2025 with OEM testing imminent.\n\nAn eye in the future\n\nAustralia is only on the cusp of starting its EV journey. Policy and EV supply are two barriers which need to be addressed first, but by keeping an eye on innovation around the globe, we can work towards a smart transition.\n\nPaul Sinclair is Telematics Solutions Advisor at RACV’s mobility technology company, Intelematics.",
    "Emerging challenges for Australia electric vehicle charging infrastructure": "Structural challenges are emerging for Australia’s new EV charging infrastructure, with growing concerns regarding inter-operable access to charging stations, charging station availability, maintenance and customer behaviour while charging and trip planning.\n\nCurrent Australian policies and programs to develop the charging network\n\nAcross Australia, there has been a push from state governments to construct and support an expanding network of Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) (often referred to as “charging stations” or “charging points”) to both drive and satisfy an ever-increasing growth in the uptake of electric vehicles (EVs).\n\nCommitments by State Governments include:\n\nWestern Australia’s build of the world’s longest continuously connected electric highway, installing 98 EVSEs over 6,600kms and costing a total of $43.5 million.\n\nbuild of the world’s longest continuously connected electric highway, installing 98 EVSEs over 6,600kms and costing a total of $43.5 million.

Victoria’s $19 million for the rollout of EVSEs for Victorian Government’s commercial EV fleets and destination charging throughout regional Victoria.\n\n$19 million for the rollout of EVSEs for Victorian Government’s commercial EV fleets and destination charging throughout regional Victoria. NSW's $149 million investment into developing charging network across the state, including co-funding private industry development of fast-charging stations.\n\nOverseas comparisons – Europe and the United States\n\nThe push for EVSE and larger EV fleets is also being mirrored around the world.\n\nIn the US, the Biden-Harris Administration has:\n\ncommitted to the goal to build the first US national network of 500,000 EVSEs along the US’s highways by 2030; and\n\nsecured $7.5 billion USD for EV charging infrastructure, of which: $5 billion USD is to fund the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program for individual states to build out their charging networks; and $2.5 billion USD is to be offered in competitive grants to support community and corridor charging in under-served and overburdened communities.\n\n\n\nIn Europe, the recent decision of the European Parliament to mandate that all new car and van sales should be zero emissions from 2035 has also spurred EV sales and EVSE construction across the EU.\n\nMaintenance gaps result in out-of-service charging stations\n\nDespite commitments to the roll-out of fast and standard EVSEs across Australia and overseas, there is a growing chorus of discontent from EV owners, who complain of EVSE outages, unavailability and impact on travel plans, which is now receiving media attention.\n\nFlooding, equipment damage or failure, missing parts and delayed maintenance responses are all cited as reasons for outages by EV users. While some of these problems are inevitable, outages for the same issue can last for weeks, if not months, permeating the whole charging network, causing unreliability for consumers.\n\nAs consumers, councils, governments and other corporations make the full-time switch from traditional internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) to EVs, the reliability and maintenance of EVSE will become an increasingly critical factor in the pace of EV uptake, and may also have commercial and legal implications for EVSE suppliers, installers and operators.\n\nContract and business models that may plug the gap\n\nA key lesson from this emerging issue is to provide greater focus in the procurement process to the operational phase of an EVSE install. As has been noted by Thomas Caldwell, Global CTO of Techniche, writing recently in Forbes: \"Runaway repair costs can easily ruin the ROI on an EV charger investment.\"\n\nHowever, a proper maintenance and service structure is not always a simple task to achieve. To do so, parties must navigate a variety of commercial and legal complexities including:\n\nidentifying who takes the long-term risk of EVSE availability: is it a fuel company, an energy provider, a commercial retailer or government agency?\n\nunderstanding an asset’s life-cycle management from station design and installation to operations and refresh / decommissioning;\n\nensuring both software and hardware support, particularly for EVSE software licensed and supported by a third-party provider;\n\naligning various contractual and financial incentives to achieve a commercial and viable support and maintenance outcome throughout the equipment’s lifecycle; and\n\nproviding an effective, reliable and appealing end-user outcome and experience.\n\nA variety of installation and service models are available in the market currently, which range from:\n\na basic EVSE installation service, where customers buy the EVSE outright and may receive ongoing product warranties and basic software support; to\n\na full infrastructure-as-a-service subscription model, where the customer has no ownership and simply pays a periodic fee for a guaranteed level of EVSE availability and performance.\n\nFactors to consider in entering such contracts include:\n\nIs the EVSE providing a standalone service, or is it intended to support other commercial or operational benefits?\n\nIs there opportunity to levy usage fees on some or all users of the EVSE, and will those fees apply to unknown third parties / the general public, or to employees / contractors for whom other charging frameworks may be available?\n\nWhat is the physical layout of the facility, and are existing facility management arrangements sufficient to accommodate longer-term support and maintenance arrangements for EVSE?\n\nHow scalable is the EVSE offering, and how many EVSE installations can be made before the existing electrical infrastructure of a site needs to be enhanced?\n\nCustomer behaviour: do we need new etiquettes (or rules)\n\nBeyond user frustrations with EVSE outages, there is also a growing debate about the ‘normal’ etiquette for using public EVSEs ranging from regular reports of non-EV users parking in public charging sites (or “ICE-ing”) or EV users parking in those sites without charging to monopolisation of public fast-chargers where there are no usage limits in place.\n\nIn November 2019, the Transport and Infrastructure Council (now, the Infrastructure and Transport Ministers’ Meetings) approved the Australian Road Rules Amendment 2019, providing draft legislation to make offences of improperly parking in public charging sites. To date, these amendments have been implemented by Victoria, the Northern Territory and Queensland, with other States and Territories to follow suit in the near future.\n\nAs driver numbers and available bays for EVSE increase, we expect to see further reform in this area.\n\nNetwork challenges for major station upgrades\n\nSubstantial EVSE installations may require electricity network connections to be upgraded.\n\nFor example, as part of the Victorian Government's Zero Emissions Bus Trial, electrical substation upgrades have been required to provide necessary power requirements to bus depots. As hub or depot EVSE installations increase in other transport sectors (such as hire cars and logistics / corporate fleets), significant further upgrades are likely to be required.\n\nSince 2021, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) has been funding projects to expand the public charging network to address EV charging blackspots, increase public take-up and better understand how the emerging market will function. Significantly, the projects are also designed to ensure renewable energy is used to power all charging sites, and aim to provide insights into:\n\nthe impact of public fast charging on the electricity grid;\n\nthe effect of existing tariffs on EVSE use-cases; and\n\nthe relationship between EV uptake, utilisation and charger congestion.\n\nThe outcomes of ARENA's analysis will be critical in informing how energy and transport sectors can integrate renewable energy generation into an enhanced grid infrastructure to support decarbonisation goals, and in identifying the legal and commercial risks and opportunities this presents.",
