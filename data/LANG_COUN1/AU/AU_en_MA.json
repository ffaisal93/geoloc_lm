    "A travel guide to Morocco": "The key ingredient in mint tea is time. Well, time and mint, of course, but it's time that matters the most. Every Moroccan has their own recipe for mint tea. But the one thing that each fiercely individual routine has in common with the other is that it should never, ever be rushed. In the desert, a single pot can take an hour to perfect. Here, in a small village in the Atlas Mountains, our guide Abdul begins the ritual of pouring glasses and returning them to the pot, pouring and returning, the tea leaves muddling with the fresh mint over and over again. He will not be hurried. I am seated on a terrace draped in soft carpets belonging to Hassan and Safida – and Abdelhaid, their boisterous three year old – who opened up their home to us for a morning. A two-and-a-bit-hour drive out of Marrakech, the Atlas Mountains are home to the Berber tribe, who have lived in Morocco for thousands of years. It is beautiful up here, bare and crisp, the mountains capped with snow, and there is that sense of alertness which comes when you are really, really high. Everything feels sharp and clear. It's a stark contrast to the Marrakech we've just left behind: teeming with life, quickening your pulse the second you step out the door, hectic and thrilling. This day trip to the Atlas Mountains comes midway through our Abercrombie & Kent tour of the country, which begins in seaside Casablanca – \"Here's looking at you, kid\" – before crossing the country to the densely turreted Fes, hopping over to the ochre-walled Marrakech and ending back on Morocco's coast in the sun-blistered resort destination Oualidia. It's an itinerary that takes in big cities and small towns, buzzy medinas and blissful spas, food and wine, markets and museums, and all of the history – and modernity – that makes Morocco so alluring. If you have never journeyed to the North African nation before, an eight-day trip barely scratches the surface of everything Morocco has to offer. But, as is so often the case with travel, you'll just have to come back.\n\nAbdul pours the final glass; the tea is ready. It's strong – tangy from the green leaves, fresh from the mint, and sweet from the big chunk of sugar that has been dunked into the pot. It's good. \"Saha,\" Abdul exclaims, raising his glass towards me. \"Cheers.\" The heat in Morocco sticks to your bones, like a tagine. It's February and allegedly winter when I land in Casablanca, but I've come from London, where February really is winter: grey and grim, deep in the grip of a never-ending rain cloud. Casablanca, by contrast, is creamy and exquisite and every street sounds like the sea. Breakfast is a plate of baghrir, the poetically named pancakes of a thousand holes, like a slim, flattened crumpet fashioned from semolina flour. Doused in amlou – a paste of honey, almonds and argan oil – and washed down with a thick, syrupy cup of Moroccan coffee, they are addictive. Moroccan coffee has much in common with the indelible Turkish variety. \"When my mother was making coffee, I could smell it in the street,\" jokes Mohammed, our guide for the week. From Casablanca, we make our way inland to Fes. It's even warmer here, closer to Morocco's desert heartland. The rush of ocean air feels like a distant memory; Fes is dried out and toasted. At 10 o'clock in the morning, we walk through the entrance to Fes' thousand-year-old medina, a snaking maze of more than 9000 alleys containing countless market stalls, 300 mosques, a historic synagogue and the world's oldest university. It is silent. A motorbike chugs past, huffing and puffing as it trundles along. A few kids with fistfuls of coins are buying baghrir for breakfast. But then we turn a corner and the medina comes alive: the burning heat of the public ovens, where you can bring a disc of flatbread from home and bake it for a few coins, the sizzle of meat frying in cast-iron pans, stalls with spices piled perilously high like a pyramid, including ras el hanout, the famous Moroccan mix, an 11-secret-herbs-and-spices-esque blend unique to every stallholder. Round another corner and the streets are empty again, the air fragrant and still.\n\nFes is a study in contrasts: ancient and modern, frantic and serene. And spicy and sweet, as I learn at a cooking class held on the rooftop of the Palais Amani, a mosaic-riddled riad in the heart of the medina. It's dusk and the light on the terrace is warmed over and coppery, like a spoonful of amlou. The Moroccan cuisine is \"toujours le saveur,\" declares Abdul, our teacher for the evening, dressed in pristine chef whites and, appropriately, a jaunty red fez. I am making tagine – what else? – and zaalouk, a Moroccan entrée of smoked eggplant and spiced tomatoes, which is described as a salad but is served with wedges of flatbread still warm from the grill. Zaalouk is simple and moreish: grated tomato thrown into a pan with cumin, paprika and quite a lot of garlic, then mashed with the eggplant. And the tagine is just as good, an unfussy recipe of chicken, seared in a pan with an onion, turmeric, ginger, saffron, preserved lemon, parsley, coriander and green olives. The chicken cooks in the marinade, and then the whole thing cooks in that famous tapered clay pot, which traps all the flavour inside like a reverse cycle air-conditioner. The result is a cheerful yellow stew studded with green olives, like little jewels, where spice is applied for taste, not heat. For dessert, we experiment with a delicate jawhara, layers of crisp filo pastry filled with orange-blossom custard and dusted with cinnamon. Abdul hands out bottles of ice-cold Casablanca Lager. When I place my tagine into the oven, the call to prayer begins to echo over the rooftops, rippling through the city. Morocco does a roaring trade in rooftops. Every riad in Fes and Marrakech seems to have one, done up with canvas pagodas and very thirsty ferns. A few days later, I sit on the rooftop at El Fenn, one of the city's buzziest hotels, drinking a mojito on a sofa the colour of saffron. El Fenn is a scene. Every corner is styled like an Instagram flatlay, the music ripped from a Mykonos beach club. Madonna hired out the whole hotel in 2018 for her 60th birthday; Gwen Stefani and Gwyneth Paltrow have both checked in. The hotel, co-owned by Vanessa Branson – sister to Sir Richard Branson, whose own palatial pile Kasbah Tamadot is a luxurious retreat nestled high in the Atlas Mountains – is a reminder of Morocco's enduring allure for creative types. Marrakech is where Yves Saint Laurent made a permanent base, out of the azure-blue homestead known as the Majorelle Garden, which today is open to the public with an adjoining Yves Saint Laurent museum next door. Marrakech remains a creative hub. Meriem Nour, a Central Saint Martins-trained designer, is the owner of Hanout, an atelier for finely tailored kaftans in the heart of the Marrakech medina. Just outside is Plus61, an airy restaurant that looks like it belongs on the streets of Surry Hills, which is apt, given chef Andrew Cibej is ex-121BC and Berta. There are lamingtons on the dessert menu.\n\nAncient medinas, buzzing cities and, now, coastal retreats. My journey ends in Oualidia, a sleepy resort town three hours outside of Marrakech. Oualidia is a brief bus ride from Essaouira, a more bustling seaside city famous for serving as the location for several television shows and films you've definitely seen. (Essaouira is the real-life Astapor in season three of Games of Thrones, aka the city where Daenerys went full dracarys.) Seagulls provide a cacophonous soundtrack to a morning spent inside these sandstone walls. Mohammed estimates almost 80 per cent of Essaouirans make their living out on the ocean. In Oualidia, it's even more concentrated: this town of about 5800 people is the oyster capital of the nation. The coastal drive to La Sultana Oualidia, a tranquil coastal retreat, is lined with people selling their wares. Each oyster is as big as your fist and farmers journey out into the curved lagoon every day to bring them back for hungry punters. La Sultana is a true oasis: just 12 rooms, each decorated like a beach house in a Nancy Meyers movie. There's a first-rate spa offering the traditional Moroccan hammam, where steam is used to cleanse your body, followed by deep – and I mean deep – exfoliation. I leave feeling squeaky clean. Later, I walk to the hotel's restaurant, situated in a sunken conservatory, for my last dinner. It's a beautiful place to eat seafood – fat crayfish on a bed of spiced couscous, crabs bigger than their serving platters, legs dangling over the side – but also a little otherworldly. At the door is a long jetty that leads to a shack perched right out in the ocean. In high tide, it feels like you're walking on water to get there. This is La Sultana's oyster bar, a place to have a glass of something cold and a plate of a dozen oysters; practically dinner in and of itself. I drink a glass of Champagne. It's 7.30pm and the sun is taking its time setting, really putting on a show, and after a week in Morocco everything feels revitalised and refreshed. Saha to that.",
    "A Look At PauknAir Flight 4101's Crash In Morocco": "The story of how a Spanish BAE 146 crashed in North Africa, killing all passengers and crew.\n\nExactly 24 years ago yesterday, a PauknAir British Aerospace 146 with the registration EC-GEO crashed short of Melilla Airport (MLN) in the Spanish enclave of Melilla on the Moroccan coast. With an area of just 4.7 square miles and a population of 87,000, Melilla is one of two autonomous Spanish cities in Morocco, the other being Ceuta.\n\nThe plane involved in the crash was the seventh BAe 146 ever built, making its first flight in 1983 before being delivered new to British Airways. A year later, the plane went to Dan-Air London. It later went into storage for several years before being acquired by Spanish regional airline PauknAir in 1995.\n\nThe plane departed Malaga for North Africa early in the morning\n\nOn September 25, 1998, the plane took off from what is now Malaga Costa del Sol Airport (AGP) for the short 129-mile hop over the Mediterranean Sea to the Spanish autonomous city of Melilla on the coast of Morocco.\n\nIt takes around 55 minutes to fly from Malaga to Melilla. Image GCmaps\n\nIn charge of the flight was 39-year-old Captain Diego Clavero Muñoz, assisted by 28-year-old First Officer Bartolomé Jiménez.\n\nFlight 4101 departed Malaga at 07:25 local time and climbed to a cruising altitude of 14,000 feet. The co-pilot then contacted Air Traffic Control (ATC) in Seville, asking for clearance to descend to 7,000 feet which was approved. Two minutes later, the now inbound aircraft was cleared to descend a further 2,000 to flight level FL 50 and contact Melilla tower for instructions. During the conversation, the co-pilot informed Melilla Tower that they were 30 nautical miles out, descending to 5,000 feet.\n\nThe BAE 146 that crashed was the 7th of its type built. Photo: Uli Elch via Wikimedia Commons.\n\nMelilla Tower reported that Runway 33 was in use with visibility of five miles and a few clouds at 1,000 feet with five knots of wind. At 06:45 Moroccan time, the co-pilot told Melilla Tower that they were now at 3,000 feet, 22 nautical miles from the runway. As the descent continued, the aircraft crossed the Moroccan coast at an altitude of 1,100 feet.\n\nThe area is impacted by low clouds\n\nBecause of Melilla Airport's location on Cape Tres Forcas, visibility is often a problem as clouds accumulate in the steep valleys formed by the mountains of the cape. As the descent into Melilla continued flying under instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), the pilot complained of fog and could be heard saying, \"I see nothing.\" At 06:49, the GPWS alarm warned the pilots that they were dangerously close to the ground. At about 890 feet, the GPWS alarm sounded again, \"Whoop, whoop, Pull Up, Whoop, whoop, Pull Up.\" At 06:50, the aircraft impacted the ground at 886 feet, killing all 38 passengers and crew.\n\nEl 25-09-1998, hace 23 años hoy, un avión #BAE146 (EC-GEO) de la compañía española #PauknAir, se estrelló contra una montaña 8 millas al Norte del Aeropuerto de #Melilla. Era el #Vuelo4101. Murieron 38 personas (34 pax y 4 tripulantes). Hoy, descansan en Paz y para siempre ➡ pic.twitter.com/zMXkjYo58Y — Iván Castro Palacios (@ivancp25) September 25, 2021\n\nThe investigation into the crash of PauknAir Flight 4101\n\nIn its final report into the incident, the accident investigation concluded that the crash was due to impact with terrain while flying under IMC conditions. The crash was put down as being a Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT), listing several contributing factors, which were:\n\nThe non-application of arrival procedures, including descending below a safe altitude.\n\nPoor working communication between the captain and first officer.\n\nA non-application of guidelines regarding the ground proximity warning system (GPWS).",
    "Morocco: Iconic women’s rights advocate Aicha Chenna passes away – The North Africa Post": "Aicha Chenna, the iconic women’s rights advocate who was part of the first generation of Moroccan women who raised the banner of the struggle for equality and the promotion of women’s rights in Morocco passed away on Saturday at the age of 81 and was laid to rest on Sunday.\n\nAicha Chenna was born on August 14, 1941 in Casablanca. She left to live in Marrakech before returning to Casablanca in 1953. Fatherless, she studied nursing and then worked as a health and social education moderator in the Ministry of Health. Very early, she had to deal with vulnerable women and issues that were considered as social and religious taboos. She is leaving behind a valuable legacy in matters of women’s rights as she was one of the most prominent defenders of these rights and as she tirelessly struggled and took initiatives that sought to empower women, especially single mothers.\n\nIt was an uphill task. Single mothers are ostracized in Moroccan society and so are their children born out of wedlock. Yet, Aicha Chenna managed to endure all difficulties, and out of sheer determination, she confronted all criticism.\n\nIn 1985, she founded the Association Solidarité féminine (ASF) for the defense of women’s rights and abandoned children. It was the first association in Morocco to offer training and literacy courses to give financial and professional independence to single mothers and victims of rape, often rejected by their families and by society.\n\nShe made of the advocacy for single mothers a life battle to grant these women the rights they did not have, as she fought for the status of illegitimate and abandoned children and of incest victims.\n\nAicha Chenna’s activism, recognized at the national and international level, has been supported by King Mohammed VI. She once said: “The King has shown me his blessing and has given me the key to the success of my mission. His encouragement, his high concern and his magnanimous gestures strengthen my conviction and give me every day the strength and courage to continue.”\n\nShe was awarded for her remarkable work of activism back in 2009, when she won the $1 million Opus Prize, which she said would be used to ensure that her foundation carries on its work even after her death.\n\n“Today, Morocco has lost a symbol of the feminist human rights struggle…Aicha Chenna was the mother of all, and her achievements in the human rights field will remain a source of pride for all Moroccans,” commented university professor and researcher in sociology, Somaya Noaman guessous.\n\nAicha Chenna, or the Mother-Courage, who made great sacrifices at the expense of her time and personal life for the sake of single mothers, in order to preserve their dignity, render justice for children born out of wedlock, and to reverberate the voice of vulnerable groups, especially women, will always be remembered as an icon of feminism and activism in Morocco and beyond.",

Internet accessibility in Morocco is ranked 78th, down 8 places from 2021.\n\nThe North Africa country, however, still needs to improve the quality and stability of internet. On that aspect, the Kingdom is far from the world average by 19 points, losing 34 places on this index. The infrastructure is also ranked 83rd in the world.\n\nIsrael, overall, leads the index overtaking Denmark ranked 1st last year. Germany, France and Sweden are respectively ranked 3rd, 4th and 5th.\n\nThe top ten also feature Netherlands, Finland, Japan, United Kingdom and South Korea.",
    "Morocco combats the needs by importing more than 5 million tonnes of cereals": "In a context where Ukraine, one of the main wheat producers, is at war, and in a situation of climatic emergency, the Moroccan government has also seen an increase in cereal shortages. For this reason, Morocco has implemented a series of measures to avoid shortages and the impact on the local market. In this sense, the Kingdom has increased the number of grain suppliers.\n\nCountries such as Argentina and France will be new suppliers to the country. Both nations will join the list of more than 25 countries to which the Alawi kingdom opened up in 2021 to guarantee the supply of domestic needs. The state of grain stocks in Europe and Argentina for the 2022/2023 season would be assured, according to projections by the Ministry of Agriculture, Maritime Fisheries, Rural Development and Water and Forestry. In addition, they add that the harvest data for these countries for this new year are encouraging and remain stable.\n\nTo this we must add the cereal produced within the country. According to data from the balance of the previous season, more than 34 million quintals were produced. This includes 18.9 million quintals of soft wheat, 8.1 million quintals of durum wheat and 7 million quintals of barley. The government also granted a premium for imported grain from November 2021.\n\nPHOTO/FILE - Grain\n\nThese volumes of grain can be imported thanks to the large number of global grain shippers with whom the Moroccan government cooperates. According to Intercereales (a group of French cereal exporters), \"imports of common wheat would be 4.5 to 5 million tonnes next year due to the drought. France has already delivered nearly one million quintals of wheat during the summer months, according to Yann Lebeau, head of the group of professionals in the Maghreb region at Intercereales in a press release. By the end of this year, the country is expected to receive a total of 2.5 million quintals of wheat from France. Thanks to this strategy of diversification of cereal sources, Morocco has been shielded from external fluctuations, due to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, which are, respectively, the second and third largest supplier of soft wheat to the Kingdom, the ministry said.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the collaboration of the agencies concerned and the country's government is working to meet the country's five-month consumption needs. Tensions in certain parts of the country complicate the situation. The objective of the measures imposed by the Executive is to mitigate the impact on the purchasing power of citizens due to the rise in prices and the inflation rate. The significant increase in Morocco's import bill is linked to products such as barley and soybean oil. The increase in prices rose compared to the previous year by 47.4%, in the case of barley by as much as 820 %. Foods such as sugar, tea and edible oils, which are considered staples, would be the first to be affected by the measures, according to the Royal High Guidelines. Possible scenarios for stockpiling of staple food stocks, such as those mentioned above, were also set out and an inventory of existing storage facilities for both raw materials and finished products was discussed.\n\nPHOTO/AFP - Terminal I of the port of Tangier Med\n\nIn his speech to Parliament on the occasion of the opening of the first session of the first legislative year, King Mohammed VI called for the implementation of a policy of stockpiling strategic commodities, \"we will first of all stress the necessary consolidation of Morocco's position and the imperative defence of its superior interests, particularly in the current situation which brings with it challenges, risks and threats. Indeed, the pandemic crisis has revealed the strong return of the sovereignty issue. Whether it be health, energy, industrial, food or other, the preservation of sovereignty has become the subject of a real competition, which is causing some people to react feverishly\".",

His case is just the latest attempt by the authorities to use absurd prosecutions to silence critical voices and highlights the worrying crackdown in Morocco on freedom of expression.\n\nThe only ‘crime’ Rida Benotmane has committed was to air legitimate grievances against the authorities in a few social media posts and videos Amna Guellali, Amnesty International\n\n\n\n“Rida Benotmane should be freed immediately and these bogus charges against him dropped. The Moroccan authorities must ensure that people are able to exercise their freedom of expression without fear of reprisals.”\n\n\n\nAmnesty International has reviewed court files showing that the National Judicial Police Brigade (BNPJ) in Casablanca interrogated Rida Benotmane over a Facebook post he published on 13 September 2021, which called for a public march against abuses by security forces. Police also questioned him over two YouTube videos published in August 2021, in which he denounced the authorities for ignoring people’s demands for social justice and warned against the potential use of COVID vaccine passes as a tool of repression.\n\nBenotmane was arrested on 9 September and charged the next day with “insulting a body regulated by law”, “insulting public officials while carrying out their duties”, and “broadcasting and distributing false allegations without consent” under articles 265, 263, and 447-2 of the Penal Code respectively. He was also charged with breaching the decree law on the state of health emergency. He will appear before the Rabat first instance court on 22 September.\n\nBenotmane, a member of the Moroccan Association for the defense of human rights (AMDH) and a political activist who has already spent four years in jail, is currently on hunger strike in protest at his detention.\n\nBackground\n\nMoroccan authorities have increasingly targeted dissenting voices in recent months.\n\nIn April 2022, Saida el Alami, a human rights defender and member of the “Femmes Marocaines Contre la Detention Politique” collective, was sentenced to two years in prison for posting about her ill-treatment by the police and for criticizing the repression of journalists and activists.

    "The Farce of Normalization: A Taste of Morocco and a Sip of \"Israel\"": "Normalizing ties with \"Israel\" is the official cementing of Israeli apartheid with despotic and reactionary Arab regimes, all in the name of furthering crude economic gains and regressive political ambitions.\n\nCanada’s leading Zionist lobby group held its annual parliamentary reception on September 20, 2022, and dedicated it to the \"Abraham Accords\" and in particular, the growing ties between Morocco and \"Israel\". The Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs (CIJA) picked up where they left off before Covid shut down such in-person events; and their Twitter feed was full of photos of various parliamentarians, including Canadian cabinet ministers, who attended the reception.\n\n“A taste of Morocco and a sip of Israel” was the theme for the night and highlighted the shameful normalization between the two. Morocco’s ambassador to Canada was there, and the Moroccan embassy itself was a cosponsor of the event along with the Israeli embassy. Interestingly, on its official Facebook account, the Moroccan embassy downplayed the other cosponsors and made no explicit mention of the involvement of \"Israel\" and its lobby group in organizing the reception, simply saying “Morocco guest of honor of the 2022 annual successful parliamentary reception, held this evening in Ottawa..”.\n\nHistorically, Morocco always had strong ties with successive Israeli governments, especially under the late King Hassan II. Ties that included information and intelligence exchange and as early as 1963, Mossad was reported to have opened an office in Morocco. Israeli intelligence officials later stated that King Hassan had passed them secret recordings of Arab leaders’ discussions at the 1965 Casablanca summit, which gave them a strategic advantage and helped \"Israel\" win the 1967 war.\n\nAnd in March 2013, Morocco acquired three Heron drones equipped with Israeli systems that had been routed through France and then transferred to the Moroccan Air Force after being painted in the appropriate colors.\n\nBut the new accord, signed in December 2020, can and will build on those ties and is hoping to cultivate $250 million worth of Israeli exports and business opportunities. Additionally, Israeli media speculated that “Morocco entered into a free trade agreement with Africa in early 2021, meaning it could also serve as a gateway to increasing trade with African countries in general.”\n\nNone of this treachery, however, seems to have disqualified Morocco as the chair of the Jerusalem Committee for the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.\n\nAnd now to the “sip of Israel”, which was of course Israeli wines. Most Israeli wines sold in Canada are linked to the illegal settlement enterprise; additionally, Canada still does not require any specific labeling of which wines are settlement products. According to CIJA, attendees to the reception came from “all parties”, and included the New Democratic Party leader, Jagmeet Singh, despite his recent affirmation to “end all trade and economic cooperation with illegal settlements...”.\n\nDid these parliamentarians and other guests in attendance know they were legitimizing the theft and plunder of Palestinian resources? Did any bother to question the wine that was being served? Did the Moroccan representatives and other foreign dignitaries know or care?\n\nHerein lies the real reasons that the Israeli government and its US sponsor are pushing the so-called Abraham Accords. They present the lie of “friendship” between certain Arab countries and \"Israel\" to the rest of the world and use it to further legitimize Israeli apartheid and everything it stands for. Arab regimes like Morocco get added international recognition and, in this case, support for their own occupation of Western Sahara and its huge mineral reserves. And Western politicians then join in the chorus and become the cheerleaders for such policies.\n\nAnd this is why activists across the world are adamant in denouncing this new “normalization” and are clear that it is a betrayal of the long-held aspirations of the people of the region. The so-called Abraham Accords are not the “brave success story for peace” that \"Israel\" and the Zionist lobby like to portray; rather they are an official cementing of Israeli apartheid with despotic and reactionary Arab regimes, all in the name of furthering crude economic gains and regressive political ambitions. We must say NO to such normalization!",

    "MOROCCO: Abengoa, intends to sell its shares in the Agadir desalination plant": "Nothing is certain for the moment. But according to the Spanish daily El Economista, Abengoa intends to sell its shares in the Agadir seawater desalination plant that it built. This information comes barely four months after the end of the contractual tests on the new plant. This decision would be justified by the financial difficulties that Abengoa has been facing since 2016. This led to the company being placed in receivership in February 2020, according to the Spanish newspaper.\n\nA 30-year PPP at stake\n\nSeveral groups and investment funds have already shown their interest in the Spanish giant Abengoa. This is the case of its colleague Acciona or the French group Engie which is implementing a desalination project in the Casablanca-Settat region. When contacted by AFRIK 21, Abengoa officials did not confirm this share sale project. But they do not deny the existence of a transaction in progress for Abengoa’s factory in Agadir, Morocco.\n\nIn addition to the construction of the desalination plant, Abengoa was to operate the Agadir desalination plant over a period of 30 years under the terms of a public-private partnership (PPP) signed with the National Office of Electricity and Drinking Water (Onee) and the Moroccan Ministry of Agriculture, Maritime Fishing, Rural Development and Water and Forests.\n\nAbengoa financed the desalination project for 41 billion Moroccan dirhams (nearly €3.9 billion) with its local partner InfraMaroc, an investment fund launched by CDG Capital and backed by Morocco’s Caisse de dépôt et de gestion (CDG). The new facility is capable of supplying 275,000 m3 of water per day, divided between the needs of the population of Greater Agadir (150,000 m3 per day) and the irrigation (125,000 m3 per day) of agricultural land. These plantations are located in the Chtouka plain, a large market gardening area. This capacity is expandable to 400,000 m3 per day. The project has also enabled the construction of an irrigation network for an area of 15,000 hectares.\n\nInès Magoum",

The all-new Caravan Agafay will open in October as a stunning new escape in Morocco.\n\nInspired by Burning Man's imagination and spiritually connected experience, Caravan Agafay will support nomad Bedouin culture while embracing the local traditions of communal living. With a focus on an immersive glamping experience, the property will span 12 acres and feature 20 beautifully designed Moroccan canvas wall tents, all with views of the Atlas Mountains. Travelers will enjoy a gourmet restaurant using locally sourced ingredients, two swimming pools, a horse & camel stable, outdoor cinema, and a yoga/wellness center.\n\nSwimming pool at Caravan Agafay by Habitas Habitas, Kleinjan Groenewald\n\nI spoke with Oliver Ripley, the CEO of Habitas, about what inspired him to open a new property in Morocco. \"Morocco has always been a destination we wanted to bring Habitas to,\" he said. \"As a country rich in diverse culture, nature, history and with very warm and welcoming people, we felt it aligned perfectly with our vision: human connection, authentic experiences, learning, and discovery.\"\n\n\"As with all our 'homes,' the sense of discovery and exploration for our guests is crucial. Morocco embraces this with a high sense of adventure, from the cities of Marrakech and Casablanca to the Atlas Mountains, the Saharan desert to the rich coastline. While Marrakech is well known globally, Agafay is an unknown secret a short distance away.\"\n\nNomadic glamping at Caravan Agafay by Habitas Habitas\n\n\"Our new desert retreat is close to Marrakech and within close proximity to Europe and allows guests to immerse fully with the desert and experience local tribes, culture, and programming. The desert holds very special energy and the respect we have for her. Our guests can enjoy rich adventure programming, magical sunrises and sunsets, communal dining experiences, traditional wellness including horse therapy, and authentic connections with the local community.\"\n\n\"Caravan Agafay is just the beginning for us in this enchanting country. We are already working on several more locations in Morocco that will create connections between locals and visitors, sharing Moroccan hospitality (who are kind, welcoming people with big smiles!).\"\n\nExterior view of Caravan Agafay by Habitas Habitas\n\nThe Agafay Desert is a barren, rocky landscape and one of the country’s last remaining expanses of natural desert. Visitors come for horse-riding, dune-gazing, canoeing on Takerkoust Dam, visiting local mud-built Berber villages, and marvel at the sight of nomads and sheepherders in the distance. This is the perfect escape from the bustle of Marrakech, where you can truly experience life as a nomad.\n\nA typical day of adventure in this remote area could include visiting the valleys of Imlil, Ait Mizan, Ait Souka, and Asni and trekking to the Toubkal waterfall. Visit Tahnaout town market, where they make Argan Oil from the local nuts, and take a traditional camel voyage to Moulay Brahim Valley.\n\nCaravan Agafay by Habitas Habitas, Kleinjan Groenewald\n\nI am a huge fan of Habitas and its focus on creating a diverse community of people, all seeking human connection and authentic experiences while creating a better future together. With the concept of creating unique luxury resorts, they have minimal impact on the surroundings while focusing on the people to make deeper human connections. They also directly impact local communities through education, employment, and the creation of sustainable micro-economies.

The deal was signed by Israeli Defence Minister Benny Gantz and Morocco's Minister in charge of National Defence Administration, Abdellatif Loudiyi, last November.\n\nThe Israel Defence website reported from local security sources that the technology in question is linked to the secret Elenit intelligence system for electronic warfare, which is manufactured by Elbit Systems. It is used to collect radar signals from air defence systems. Elbit confirmed the delivery of ground units equipped with electronic support, countermeasures and command and control systems.\n\nAccording to the same sources, these units will allow the Moroccan armed forces to respond effectively to air and ground threats. The technology can be used with drones already deployed by Morocco such as the Israeli-made Harop and Turkiye's Bayraktar TB2. Israeli reports say that the deal is worth up to $70 million for a thirty-month contract.\n\nThe announcement coincides with details of another air defence deal between Morocco and Israel.

    "British growers consider moving production to Morocco": "British producers of fruits and vegetables are considering shifting their operations to warmer countries, including Morocco. Chief Executive of the British Growers Association Jack Ward suspects that the European production of fruit and vegetables will move south: \"We will move production further and further south, down through Spain and into Morocco and bits of Africa.\"\n\nThe ongoing surge in energy prices has prompted farmers in northern and western Europe to suspend or cut their activities. Ward argues that the rising production costs are set to impact the growth of crops such as tomatoes, peppers, and cucumbers that require heated greenhouses during winter. The production of apples, onions, and endives which necessitate cold storage of crops, will also be impacted. Excessive energy bills and fertilizer prices have heavily impacted growers in France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Spain.\n\nAs European agricultural producers turn to Morocco to increase their profit margin amid a serious economic crisis, some French and Spanish farmers continue to protest the importation of Moroccan fruits and vegetables, questioning the quality of the goods.\n\nSource: moroccoworldnews.com",

    "Is Tunisia Abandoning Morocco for Algeria?": "For decades, Tunisia has looked on, maintaining its neutral stance as both sides jockeyed for dominance. However, by appearing to have unilaterally invited Brahim Ghali, the Polisario leader and president of the self-declared Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, to a conference it was holding in tandem with Japan, that neutrality has come into question. Moreover, for many observers, the invitation confirmed what many suspected: that Tunisia is growing increasingly close to Algeria, potentially at the expense of its historically close ties with Morocco, while Rabat’s relations with Japan, which Tunis enjoys a burgeoning relationship with, are cast into doubt.\n\nThe Polisario Front, with Algerian support, has been fighting to secure independence for the disputed territory of the Western Sahara since 1973, a move fiercely contested by Morocco since it claimed the territory in dramatic fashion two years later, when some 350,000 flag-carrying Moroccans crossed the desert in Rabat’s “Green March” and essentially forced Spain to hand it over. Fleeing the Moroccan advance, the local population, the Sahrawis, headed for Algeria, eventually settling in a cluster of refugee camps near Tindouf, where they have remained since.\n\nPower balances in North Africa are shifting. The latest indication that Algeria’s star is rising—along with European demand for its natural gas—as Moroccan influence wanes was all but confirmed by Tunisia’s decision to include the leader of the Western Sahara independence movement the Polisario Front in an investment conference, a move seemingly designed to ruffle feathers in Morocco.\n\nPower balances in North Africa are shifting.

Moreover, for many observers, the invitation confirmed what many suspected: that Tunisia is growing increasingly close to Algeria, potentially at the expense of its historically close ties with Morocco, while Rabat’s relations with Japan, which Tunis enjoys a burgeoning relationship with, are cast into doubt.\n\nThe details of the invitation are opaque at best. The conference, the eighth Tokyo International Conference on African Development, was staged in Tunisia, where Ghali flew in to be met, as with other leaders, off the plane by Tunisian President Kais Saied.\n\nAlthough Morocco’s sensitivity on the subject of the Western Sahara may seem surprising, the fate of the territory has become a central pillar of the kingdom’s worldview.\n\nHis presence appeared to take many by surprise, not least Morocco, which swiftly issued furious missives of the “hurt” caused to the Moroccan people by Tunis’s action. Ambassadors were withdrawn by both countries while Morocco’s newspapers denounced Tunisia’s shortcomings.\n\nSaied and his foreign ministry claimed surprise at the reaction, citing a circular from the African Union, which extended the invitation to all leaders, including Ghali. A statement was issued by the foreign ministry, reaffirming the country’s total neutrality in line with international law, stating, “This position will not change until the concerned parties find a peaceful solution acceptable to all.”\n\nSaied’s ultimate goal remains a matter for speculation. However, with Algeria proving a key energy supplier during Tunisia’s seemingly endless economic crisis while lending vocal support to the president’s legitimacy, Algiers’ rising clout was likely prominent in Saied’s thoughts.\n\nAlthough Morocco’s sensitivity on the subject of the Western Sahara may seem surprising, the fate of the territory has become a central pillar of the kingdom’s worldview. Criticism of Rabat’s deal over the territory with the former Trump administration as well as allowing access to the country’s medical facilities have led to diplomatic breakdowns with Germany and Spain, with the latter also getting dragged into a spying scandal.\n\nSpeaking just before the conference, Morocco’s King Mohammed VI used a televised address to send what he said was a clear message to the world, telling viewers, “The Sahara issue is the prism through which Morocco views its international environment.”\n\nAs recently as December 2020, Morocco’s position appeared assured. Washington had agreed to formally recognize Rabat’s claim to the Western Sahara in return for a corresponding nod to Israel. Spain and Germany, both former critics of the kingdom’s relations with the Sahrawis, had reconciled with the kingdom, supporting Rabat’s plan to establish some form of semi-autonomous government within the region, a move resisted by the Sahrawi people, who insisted on a referendum to determine the area’s fate.\n\nHowever, with European gas prices soaring, Algeria—Europe’s third-largest gas supplier (after Russia and Norway) and the Polisario Front’s chief backer—is also enjoying a diplomatic renaissance. European politicians and regional power brokers are all enjoying a renewed interest in Algiers, with Tunisia’s Saied among them. His July visit secured the reopening of land borders, closed two years earlier to contain the spread of COVID-19, allowing Algerian families to travel into Tunisia and support Tunisia’s ill-fated tourism industry. Tunis also relies on Algeria for its own gas, buying it at a discounted price, as well as receiving revenue for the transport of Algerian gas across its territory, bound for Sicily and then the rest of Europe.\n\n“The war in Ukraine and its impacts on Europe in terms of gas supplies reposition Algeria as an important player in the western Mediterranean,” Raouf Farrah, a senior analyst with Global Initiative told Foreign Policy. “Rabat is more worried about this than its ability to obtain gas supplies at competitive prices following the closure of the [Gazoduc Maghreb Europe] pipeline, which used to supply Spain via Morocco.”\n\nThe plight of the Sahrawis is one of the world’s longest-standing refugee crises. Since 1975, thousands of Sahrawis have been sheltering in the Algerian desert, waiting for the opportunity to return home. The violent campaign fought by Polisario against Rabat was brought to an approximate end in 1991 with a United Nations-brokered cease-fire, providing for a fractious peace. However, even that appears uncertain, with clashes between the Polisario Front and Morocco increasing over the last two years.\n\nWith Algiers proving a key energy supplier during Tunisia’s economic crisis while lending vocal support to the president’s legitimacy, Algeria’s rising clout was likely prominent in Saied’s thoughtsMeanwhile, the U.N. estimates that around 90,000 “vulnerable refugees” are sheltering in the desert, relying on international aid just for their daily food and shelter. Relocating the refugees has proven a fraught problem for all concerned, with political and economic problems all serving as a break on progress.\n\nAlthough some infrastructure exists, with the refugees operating a state in exile, Bahia Awah, a Sahrawi writer and poet, told Foreign Policy—from what he described as his exile in Spain—that life remained difficult. “Weather conditions are especially adverse in this part of southern Algeria, where temperatures in summer can reach up to more than of 50 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit), which causes casualties among the elderly, children, and pregnant women.”\n\nWhile Algeria’s clout may have been boosted for now, how much difference that will make to a dispute the U.S. government weighed in on in dramatic fashion at the end of the Trump administration remains unclear. For Jonathan Hill, a historian from King’s College London, the fate of the Western Sahara and the Sahrawis has, over the decades, morphed from a pragmatic problem to an unswerving policy position and, as such, risks becoming intractable.\n\n“The problem really is one of leadership,” he said. “In 1976, at the time of the Green March, there was a practical problem that everyone recognized needed a solution. However, with both Algeria and Morocco having relatively static leaderships, where there is little change in personnel, the dispute was allowed to rumble on to the point where the Sahrawis fate really has become a matter of faith.”\n\nHow long Tunisia’s pivot may endure is uncertain. However, the fact that Tunis made that pivot at all speaks directly to the new order now taking shape within the region—whether the Sahrawis benefit from that or not.",

Generally uninterested in Moroccan democratic processes, imprisoned in a sense of dual identity, which some cope with better than others, but also optimistic and hopeful of a future in Europe with opportunities they believe are out of reach in Morocco.\n\nAFP/FADEL SENNA - Moroccan youths walking in a street in the capital Rabat on September 12, 2018\n\nIf Morocco's own youth is a challenge for Aziz Akhannouch's current government, as is often raised in the Maghreb country, it is rarely seen in the same light in Spain. \"Once you finish your studies in Spain as a non-EU foreigner, it's as if for the institutions the road is over\", sums up Sohaib N., a young Tangier-born 28-year-old resident in Madrid who came here 10 years ago to study journalism in Madrid. \"Coming here for fun or for a while is easy. But to work is not so easy. Nothing is made easier by the administration\", adds the young man, who is trying to maintain his situation in Spain in a regular way, without having the slightest intention for the moment of applying for Spanish nationality.\n\n\n\n\"I've never considered asking for nationality, it's not that important to me. Having residency is enough for me\", explains Sohaib, for whom his identity is not defined by a document or a piece of paper. As he says, his upbringing has made him someone with an ambiguous identity. A childhood in Tangiers, fully immersed in Spanish culture through television, internet, school, did not make him feel like a foreigner when he arrived in Spain. And when he returns to Morocco, he feels as Moroccan as the rest. \"I feel in the middle of the two identities\", says the young journalist, a feeling he shares with 70% of those surveyed in Spain by the CCME study. A feeling that rises to 80% in France and 84% in the Netherlands.\n\n\n\nThis is also the case of Meriem F., from Agadir, who moved to Spain 8 years ago for love and who says she feels more and more like a foreigner in Morocco. It is no longer just a question of how she feels she is perceived by others, but almost a question of comfort in her own country. \"Sometimes it even pisses me off\", explains Meriem, for whom the administration's services are a clear example of what bothers her most in Morocco. She is one of the 71% of the community that feels like a foreigner back in Morocco after a long period in Spain. Meriem wants to apply for Spanish nationality in two years' time. With the nationality, she wants to be able to participate in the Spanish electoral processes, in which she shows great interest, according to 51% of those surveyed by the CCME. \"Moroccans in Spain are a collective. We pay our taxes, we pay contributions. Of course I would like to be able to vote\", says Meriem, who also feels more than integrated in Logroño, where she lives. \"There are many cases of discrimination that do nothing to help Moroccans integrate. I understand that there are people who can't, but in my case I have overcome them. I no longer feel like a foreigner here\", adds the young businesswoman, who is working to make a small brand of handmade and natural cosmetic products prosper in collaboration with her mother from Agadir.\n\nHanan El. and Riyan H are the two youngest interviewees and both have Spanish nationality. Both are studying and, in the case of Hanan, also working. For Hanan, who had to ask for it, the essential thing is the freedom it gives. \"It's not just for travelling, it's for everything,\" explains the young woman, who specialises in fashion design. \"To work and to study everything is much easier if it is with the nationality\". Hanan defines that rather than having a \"double identity\", she feels that she is neither on one side nor the other. \"Most of the Moroccans I know were born here in Spain, but they don't feel Spanish. But neither do they feel Moroccan\".\n\nAP/MOSA’AB ELSHAMY - Informal school run by Moroccan fashion designer Fadila El Gadi, in Sale, near Rabat\n\nSomething that these four young people of Moroccan origin agree on is one of the most striking features of the CCME's report on the interest shown by the diaspora in Moroccan electoral processes. If they all claim to be regularly informed about what is happening in Morocco, they also assume that they have no interest in wanting to vote in Morocco or in learning more about its politics. According to the CCME study, only 9% of those surveyed in Spain indicated a desire to participate in Moroccan elections, the second highest figure of the six countries surveyed.\n\nThe gap between politics and young people crosses borders. In Morocco, the low turnout of 18-29 year olds in the elections is one of the headlines that make the front pages every time. Around 30% of the Moroccan population is in the 18-29 age group and a further 27 % is under 14 years of age. The 18-24 turnout in the September 2021 elections was only a meagre 3%. It rose to 19% for 25-34, according to figures available in the Moroccan press.\n\nIf neither residents in Morocco nor residents in Spain are interested in these processes, it is mainly due to the lack of accessibility to them. \"I have never voted in my life,\" Sohaib confesses. \"I think that I and the other young people don't feel involved\", adds the Tangier journalist. In his opinion, the political parties make no effort to present their electoral programmes. \"I don't think it doesn't do much good. That's my conviction. I have always seen it as an archaic system,\" Sohaib concludes.\n\nRiyan, 20, a student of an intermediate degree in administration, has a very similar feeling to Sohaib. \"It's not something I find accessible. That's why I'm not interested in elections in Morocco or politics in general. I would still like to see a lot of changes, especially for young people,\" says the young student.\n\nIn addition to the low interest in politics and elections, this age group also gave the government a clear failing grade. In measuring the degree of satisfaction with the reforms undertaken by the Moroccan government, Akhannouch's government received only 18% approval in Spain, the lowest next to Germany (12%) and a far cry from Belgium's 57%.\n\n\"Young people expect nothing from the government. They just want to be able to work once they finish their studies,\" says Meriem. She agrees with Sohaib, who at least somewhat optimistically believes that young people want the country to prosper as much as possible. This is also the view of Riyan, who at least has a positive idea of Morocco because of what it means to him and his family. \"The culture, our roots. Of course we like Morocco,\" says Riyan, who believes that young people only have a problem with the institutions and the economic situation, which offers fewer opportunities compared to Europe.\n\nAs for the future, the youngest of these interviewees is very optimistic, and even the hopefulness is evident in his voice. \"I am sure that soon something similar to what is happening in France or Belgium will happen in Spain,\" says Riyan. \"I really believe that in the next few years we will see ministers or senior officials in Spain bearing a Moroccan name\".",

Morocco criticised this episode and the fact that he was not duly informed by a country considered a partner and ally.\n\nFrom then on, there were episodes that increased tension between the two nations, such as the massive entry of thousands of illegal immigrants through the Ceuta border and the withdrawal of the Moroccan ambassador from Madrid.\n\nExcelente reunión con mi homólogo marroquí, Nasser Bourita, para hacer balance de la hoja de ruta acordada y seguir progresando en su aplicación.\n\n\n\nContinuamos avanzando en la nueva etapa.

This was demonstrated by King Mohammed VI's invitation to President Pedro Sánchez to meet in Rabat in April 2022. A meeting in which the road map that has been marking the steps to be taken in various areas within the relationship between the two countries was drawn up.\n\nPHOTO/FILE – Pedro Sánchez and Mohammed VI\n\nIn recent years, Morocco has received the support of important nations for its initiative to resolve the situation in Western Sahara, especially since December 2020, when Donald Trump's US administration recognised the Moroccan status of Western Sahara in exchange for the Kingdom establishing diplomatic relations with Israel, following in the wake of the famous Abraham Accords signed in September 2020, under which several Arab countries established ties with the Israeli state with a view to pacifying the Middle East and developing the region socially and economically.\n\nThis is in contrast to the position of the Polisario Front, which advocates the holding of a referendum on Sahrawi independence that enjoys less support at the international level, including that of Algeria, Morocco's great rival in the Maghreb.",

And Guatemala agrees with this line, something that became clear after the meeting held on Thursday between Nasser Bourita, Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs, African Cooperation and Moroccans Resident Abroad, and his Guatemalan counterpart, Mario Búcaro Flores, on the sidelines of the 77th General Assembly of the United Nations.\n\n\"Guatemala has reiterated its clear position on the regional dispute over the Moroccan Sahara, considering that autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty is the solution to this discrepancy and announces the decision to open a consulate in the city of Dakhla to take advantage of its economic potential and its openness to the rest of the African continent,\" according to a joint official statement issued after the meeting between the Foreign Ministers of the two countries.\n\n\"The concepts of sovereignty, peace and territorial integrity are very important to us.

This has been demonstrated by the boost in investment that the area is receiving, for example with the holding of the Dakhla International Investors' Forum on 18 and 19 September.\n\nGuatemala thus joins the list of countries that have decided to open consulates in the southern provinces of the Kingdom of Morocco, making it the 29th country to carry out this operation. Other countries with great international weight have already taken this decision, such as the United States and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nPHOTO/TWITTER/MAROC DIPLOMATIE/@MarocDiplomatie - Flags of Guatemala and Morocco\n\nThe Alawi kingdom is receiving strong international backing for its formula for resolving the Sahrawi conflict, based on broad autonomy for Western Sahara under Moroccan sovereignty and respecting UN resolutions. This great diplomatic support had its key moment when Donald Trump's US administration recognised the Moroccan sovereignty of the Sahara in December 2020, something reaffirmed by Joe Biden's government, in exchange for Morocco establishing diplomatic ties with Israel following the dynamic of the famous Abraham Accords sealed in September 2020, by which various Arab countries such as the Emirates and Bahrain established political relations with the Israeli state under US mediation with a view to pacifying the Middle East and promoting the region's economic and social development. Subsequently, other nations such as Germany and Spain followed suit and recognised the Moroccan initiative as the most \"realistic, serious and credible\" way to solve the Western Sahara problem.\n\nOpposing this trend is the opposing position of the Polisario Front, which advocates holding a referendum on independence for the Saharawis, a proposal that has less significant international support, including that of Algeria, Morocco's great political rival in the Maghreb, which has even broken off diplomatic relations with the Alawi kingdom due to the political differences between the two countries, including the resolution of the Western Sahara conflict.\n\nAmericas Coordinator: José Antonio Sierra",

The music teacher and conductor has lived in the oasis of M’hamid El Ghizlane in southeastern Morocco for most of his 52 years.\n\nDecades ago, he recalls, a river flowed through the oasis year round. Gazelle and sheep would drink from its banks, shaded by the dense palm groves. Now there is no steady rush of water. The ground is cracked and parched.\n\nFIRST: The last group of palm trees in the Tanseest Oasis. SECOND: Dead palm trees at the edge of the oasis of M'hamid El Ghizlane.\n\nSeated in his home on a colorful rug, over a snack of tea and dates, Sbai says his oasis faces catastrophic change. “The droughts are more and more frequent. The palm trees surrounding the oasis are dying one after the other.”\n\nEvery year, he says, the oasis gets smaller. Hundreds of brittle palm trees now border M’hamid el Ghizlane. Part of the village is buried under sand, and once-rich agricultural lands have been abandoned.\n\n(M'hammed Kilito/VII Program Mentee)\n\nStory continues below advertisement Advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement Advertisement\n\nA ‘broken’ system The crisis facing this oasis is no anomaly in Morocco, where droughts made worse by climate change are destroying once-robust ecosystems. Oasis habitats are multilayered. Date palms provide shade for other arable crops, like wheat and vegetables. Livestock graze on the land and provide for the communities. “These are systems that resisted all impacts of climate change across time,” said Youssef Brouziyne, the Middle East and North Africa representative of the International Water Management Institute. He noted that scientists study oases to understand how to make other ecosystems more resilient. But the lack of rain, as well as new intensive farming systems, have endangered the balance. “It’s broken,” he said. “When the palm tree dies, the oasis is gone.” — Aomar Boum\n\nOutside farmers have scooped up cheap land and introduced agricultural methods that suck water away from native plants. Families who worked the land for generations have lost their livelihood and left their homes.\n\n“When the palm tree dies, the oasis is gone,” said Aomar Boum, an anthropologist at the University of California, Los Angeles focused on the Middle East and North Africa. “These traditional settlements are connected to dynasties and histories and are left with no one to take care of them.”\n\nThere used to be hundreds of families in the village of Ait M’hanned, next to the southern oasis of Tighmert; only four remain, according to Mohammed Zriouili, a resident in his late 50s.\n\n“There is no more work,” he said. Most of his neighbors who used to farm have moved north.\n\n(M'hammed Kilito/VII Program Mentee) (M'hammed Kilito/VII Program Mentee) (M'hammed Kilito/VII Program Mentee) (M'hammed Kilito/VII Program Mentee)\n\nIt may only get worse. By 2100, annual rainfall is expected to decline by 30 percent in Saharan regions, home to many of the country’s oases. The drying soil has contributed to the deaths of an estimated two-thirds of Morocco’s 14 million date palms in the past century.\n\n“Date palms are very heat-tolerant crops, but their productivity may decline when temperatures exceed certain thresholds or hot conditions prevail for extended periods,” said Fatima Driouech, a Moroccan climate scientist and the vice-chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s working group I.\n\nThe shrinking of these oases is another grim omen for a warming world.\n\n(M'hammed Kilito/VII Program Mentee) (M'hammed Kilito/VII Program Mentee) (M'hammed Kilito/VII Program Mentee) (M'hammed Kilito/VII Program Mentee) (M'hammed Kilito/VII Program Mentee)\n\nStory continues below advertisement Advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement Advertisement\n\nWhat could be lost For centuries, Moroccan oases were part of the trade route that connected sub-Saharan economies to North Africa and the Mediterranean. This fostered a unique mixture of Amazigh, Jewish, Islamic, Arab and African identities imbued in all aspects of the communities, from farming techniques to music, Boum, the anthropologist, said. Oases were exoticized by colonial literature as places of respite: a cold pool of water for the desert traveler to drink from, the glittering shadow of palm leaves promising safety and shelter from the brutal Saharan heat. But really, Boum said, “these are some of the harshest places to live in.” (M'hammed Kilito/VII Program Mentee) (M'hammed Kilito/VII Program Mentee) (M'hammed Kilito/VII Program Mentee) “These are systems that resisted all impacts of climate change across time.” — Youssef Brouziyne\n\nBoum grew up in the southeastern province of Tata, in the Lamhamid Oasis. His father used to wake up at 3 a.m. to tend to the carefully crafted canals that used centuries-old irrigation techniques to bring water from the ground to the greenery. They could harvest dates from the dense palm forest by jumping from one tree to another, never touching the ground. “Now, you have holes all over the place,” Boum said.

Hicham El Fissaoui, 27, who grew up in the desert city of Guelmim, is one of many who tried to find a new life abroad when opportunities ran out at home. He immigrated to France, where he lived for a year. After working difficult and poorly paying jobs, he decided to come home. His family and friends in Morocco all thought it was a bad idea. But he found a job he likes, and a way to spread joy — working as a kindergarten teacher and volunteering as a clown for a children’s organization.

Conservationists have launched initiatives to restore palm groves and improve the use of available water, Driouech said. In the town of Skoura, beekeepers work to protect the endangered yellow bee, which is vital to the area’s unique biodiversity. Potters meld red clay using tools and techniques that date back generations. Sbai, the conductor, teaches children the music of their ancestors.

    "Israeli institutions sign partnerships with Morocco": "Ben-Gurion University of the Negev has welcomed students from Mohammed VI Polytechnic University in Morocco to its Global Health Summer program for the first time this year, while the UAE’s foreign minister H.H. Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan also recently visited the Technion campus in Haifa.\n\nThe UAE and Israel are “significantly collaborating across the educational, research and technical sectors”, Sheikh Abdullah said on his visit.\n\n“There are promising opportunities to enhance and develop this cooperation, and align it with the two countries’ efforts to achieve economic prosperity and sustainable growth,” he added.\n\nThe partnership between BGU and UM6P follows a 2021 agreement which was the first academic and scientific collaboration between universities in Israel and Morocco. Relations began in the Abraham Accords, which were initially signed in 2020 between the State of Israel and the UAE and Bahrain, and later included Morocco and Sudan.\n\nLeading Israeli universities, including the Technion, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, were also involved in cooperation agreements on academic research collaboration with UM6P in 2021.\n\nBGU has also signed an with the International University of Rabat, as leaders identified many common fields of study and research.\n\n“This year, we had the chance to include also Moroccan students”\n\nThe collaboration with BGU is specifically focused on research in the fields of aquaculture, energy and ecological rehabilitation.\n\nIn their speeches, the presidents of the universities emphasised the strategic and historical nature of the agreement as it opens a window to a meaningful partnership between Morocco and Israel.\n\nThe institutions launched their student exchange program last summer in which five students from Morocco transferred to BGU to take the month-long Global Health summer course.\n\nThe course has been running every year for seven years, and students from India, China, the US and more have attended this course during the years.\n\n“This year, we had the chance to include also Moroccan students,” BGU confirmed to The PIE News.\n\n“They were all doctorate students,” BGU explained. The students “were first chosen by their home universities and applied for the program”.\n\n“Then, an academic committee reviewed their profiles and all other applicants and only students with the requested academic background were admitted to the program,” BGU said.\n\nThe program, according to BGU, combines classroom study, professional field trips, and a one-week practicum.​ Students learn about various aspects of global health decision-making, such as globalisation, ethics, migration, and case studies like the global impact of Covid-19, climate change, AIDS, mental health, and more.\n\nIn addition, students receive a thorough social program including trips around the country and the Negev region, social activities with other international students, academic and general orientation session upon arrival."
