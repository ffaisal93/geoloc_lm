(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer)\n\nANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey on Monday summoned the Greek ambassador to protest the alleged deployment of dozens of U.S.-made armored vehicles to Greek islands which Ankara says should remain demilitarized in line with international treaties.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned, meanwhile, that Turkey wouldn't hold back on defending its rights and interests against Greece.\n\nTurkish media on Sunday published aerial images that they said showed the deployment of armored vehicles by Greece to the Aegean islands of Samos and Lesbos, heightening tensions between the two NATO countries that have a history of rivalry. Turkish officials say the deployment is in violation of the islands' nonmilitary status according to international law.\n\nTurkish officials summoned Greek Ambassador Christodoulos Lazaris to the Turkish Foreign Ministry on Monday, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported. It said Turkey also filed a protest with Washington, but didn't provide details.\n\nErdogan accused Greece of engaging in acts of provocation against Turkey.\n\n“We will not fail to defend our country’s rights and interests against Greece by using all the means at our disposal, when necessary,” Erdogan said following a Cabinet meeting.\n\nTurkey and Greece have decades-old disputes over an array of issues, including territorial claims in the Aegean Sea and disputes over the airspace there. The disputes have brought them to the brink of war three times in the last half-century.\n\nTensions flared in 2020 over exploratory drilling rights in areas of the Mediterranean Sea — where Greece and Cyprus claim exclusive economic zones — leading to a naval standoff.\n\nMore recently, Turkey has accused Greece of violating international agreements by militarizing islands in the Aegean Sea. It has also accused Greek surface-to-air missiles of locking on to Turkish F-16 fighter jets carrying out a reconnaissance mission in international airspace — an accusation Greece has rejected.\n\nAthens says it needs to defend the islands — many of which lie close to Turkey’s coast — against a potential attack from Turkey.\n\nA Greek government official told The Associated Press that Greece “fully respects” its international obligations, adding that the Greek ambassador told his interlocuters that “Greece is not the country that is threatening its neighbor with war or assembling a large landing force on its coastline as Turkey has done.”\n\nThe official added that Turkey “continues to violate Greece’s sovereignty with its continuous violations of its airspace and overflights of Greek territory.” The official, who wasn't authorized to speak publicly to the news media, made the remarks on condition of anonymity.\n\nTurkish media reports quoted security officials as saying 23 of the armored vehicles were sent to Lesbos and 18 others were sent to Samos.\n\nMeanwhile, Greek authorities said a six-year-old migration agreement between Turkey and the European Union remains in effect despite an escalating dispute between the two neighbors over the treatment of refugees.\n\nNotis Mitarachi, the migration affairs minister, said Greece will continue to observe the 2016 deal that allows it to send back most migrants travelling illegally from nearby Turkey.\n\n“It is clear that for those coming from Syria, Afghanistan, Somalia, Pakistan and Bangladesh, that Turkey is a safe country,” Mitarachi said. “Unfortunately, smugglers are still ‘selling tickets’ to people from those countries.”\n\nSpeaking at the U.N. General Assembly, Erdogan last week accused Greece of committing “crimes against humanity” by carrying out potentially deadly expulsions of migrants travelling from the Turkish mainland to nearby Greek islands.\n\nGreek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis described the claims as “absurd,” charging Turkey with “weaponizing” migration to apply political pressure on Greece and other European countries.\n\n———\n\nDerek Gatopoulos reported from Athens, Greece.",
    "Greece: EU using Med countries like a refugee 'parking lot'": "ATHENS (AP) — Greece on Monday urged the European Union to lift movement restrictions for refugees recognized by individual nations, accusing the bloc of applying a double standard when dealing with Ukrainians fleeing the war compared with the victims of other conflicts.\n\nNotis Mitarachi, Greece's migration affairs minister, said a “lack of solidarity” was holding up efforts to comprehensively reform migration rules across the 27-nation bloc.\n\nRefugees granted international protection by EU nations currently cannot take full advantage of the bloc’s provisions for free movement. But Ukrainians escaping the Russian invasion of their country face fewer restrictions.\n\n“That is not fair, and Greece will insist on that point ... the Ukrainian arrangement should apply to all refugees as long as they are officially recognized,” Mitarachi said. “Unfortunately, the EU at some point decided that countries of entry ... would be used like a parking lot for refugees who want to come to Europe.”\n\nThe EU is struggling to overcome divisions among its members over rules for refugee settlement and border protection but wants a new migration pact to be hammered out next year.\n\nNegotiations have shifted from resettlement quotas, which many eastern European countries have rejected, to a proposed voluntary mechanism.\n\nMitarachi welcomed a reported proposal that refugees could be granted free movement after a three-year waiting period, but warned that resettlement was likely to remain a major sticking point.\n\nHe told reporters: “If we don’t see progress on the issue of solidarity, a (new deal) won’t make it past the EU Council or lawmakers\" in the next few years.\n\nGreece was a key transit point for hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees entering the EU in 2015-16, many fleeing wars in Iraq and Syria. It has since toughened its borders and built a steel wall along its land border with Turkey.\n\n___ Follow all AP stories on migration at https://apnews.com/hub/migration\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

    "Best road trips in Greece": "Greece is meant for exploring, and not just by ferry. With your vehicle – rented or otherwise – there is a wealth of history, culture and, yes, beaches to savor.\n\nAway from relying solely on buses and boats, opportunities to leave crowds behind are myriad. Here are five of our favorite road trips in Greece that traverse the fabric of the country’s mainland and islands.\n\nGet local insight on destinations all over the world with our weekly newsletter delivered to your inbox.\n\nWander through the small fishing villages around the short loop on Serifos © Cavan Images / Getty Images\n\nGreek islands road trip\n\nBest road trip for beaches\n\nAthens–Paros; 180km (112 miles) total driving, not including sea travel\n\nAlthough you may think of exploring Greek islands as a sea trip, you’ll need wheels to properly explore and enjoy most of these rocky isles. This is particularly true with beaches, where the best – and least crowded – ones may only be reachable by car.\n\nFew parts of Greece are more iconic than the Cyclades, where the islands dotting the Aegean are the stuff of holiday fantasies. Start this trip in Athens, where the port of Piraeus is your gateway to what awaits. Begin on raw and rugged Serifos – less visited than many of its neighbors, it offers the perfect break from the usual hubbub of life. It has one main road that loops around the island, so your only real decision is whether to go clockwise or the reverse. Discover little fishing villages barely touched by tourism and long, sandy beaches in sheltered coves lapped by impossibly azure waters.\n\nJust next door – and within sight of Serifos – Sifnos exemplifies the distinct personalities that each of the Cycladic islands possesses. It’s popular with visitors and has a well-deserved reputation for its food traditions with many high-end and creative tavernas and restaurants. The roads radiate out from the central town of Apollonia. Follow these short and twisty routes down to a variety of seafront villages with well-developed beach scenes.\n\nMake your final stop on the large and varied island of Paros, which rewards drivers with a plethora of beaches, mountain villages and shimmering hillsides of olive trees.\n\nPlanning Tip: Your big decision on this trip is whether to use the same vehicle for the entire trip or to rent a car on each island. If you’re driving your own vehicle, you may appreciate its familiarity as you go from one island to the next. However, while many ferries transport cars, the costs can be high, and available vehicle slots may fill up even as there remains room for passengers. If hiring a car in Greece, it’s better in terms of price and hassle to just hire one separately on each island.\n\nScout new ways to explore the planet's wildest places with our weekly newsletter delivered to your inbox.\n\nThe best way to explore Greece's history and mythology is by car © Matteo Colombo / Getty Images\n\nAncient Greece\n\nBest road trip for the wonders of the classical world\n\nAthens–Ancient Olympia; 590km (367 miles)\n\nMuch of the best of Greece's classic mythology and history is best visited by car. This trip starts in Athens – of course, you must take a moment to visit the Parthenon – and winds around the mainland and the Peloponnese Peninsula, with stops at sites of legend and lore.\n\nIt’s an easy drive northwest to Ancient Delphi, situated on a breathtaking site overlooking the Gulf of Corinth. Here the fabled oracle was the spiritual center of Ancient Greece when it was at its most powerful. Drive south to Nafplio in the Peloponnese, where you can split your time between a trifecta of sights: the acropolis at Tiryns, the citadel of Ancient Mycenae and the 2500-year-old theater at Epidavros.\n\nFinally, see where modern athletic competitions trace back their roots at Ancient Olympia. Walk amidst the reconstructed stadium that hosted the first Olympic games in 776 BCE and was the site of competitions for an extraordinary 1000 years.\n\nAround Athens\n\nBest road trip for a quick visit\n\nAthens–Marathon; 136km (85 miles)\n\nVisitors to Greece are usually in a hurry to head out from Athens to the islands – and with good reason. But if you’re on a short visit or just looking for a change of pace from the capital, Attica – the water-surrounded region with Athens at its center – will reward visitors who would like to sample excellent beaches, ancient monuments and expanses of natural beauty.\n\nSome 17km (10.5 miles) southeast of Athens, Glyfada is a tiny suburb that marks the start of the so-called Apollo Coast (or Athenian Riviera, depending on whose marketing material you favor). Small beaches backed by upscale clubs and more isolated strands on coves favored by nudists dot the coast. Pause for a cultural moment at the gleaming marble Temple of Poseidon at Cape Sounion.\n\nFollowing the craggy shore northeast, finish your drive at Marathon – yes, that Marathon – where Pheidippides began his run to Athens with news of military victory. Today, it’s a comfortable and beachy suburb, where the greatest challenge you’ll face is choosing between its many seafront tavernas.\n\nPause your Crete road trip to enjoy one of the island's numerous uncrowded beaches © SolStock / Getty Images\n\nThe magnificent island of Crete\n\nBest road trip for exploring a Mediterranean highlight\n\nIraklio–Hania; 280km (174 miles)\n\nGeographically very much separate from the rest of Greece but culturally a core part of the nation, Crete is unmissable. The Mediterranean’s fifth largest island (right after Corsica) is a panoply of historical sights, areas of superb natural beauty, hidden and uncrowded beaches and soaring peaks that seem almost Alpine in their grandeur.\n\nStart in the eastern city of Iraklio and go immediately south to the ancient Minoan Palace of Knossos. Get lost within this sprawling complex where the links to the past are tangible. Drive west to the holy site of Moni Arkadiou, a 16th-century monastery that embodies the indomitable Cretan spirit. Here you can understand how invaders from the Romans to the Turks to the Nazis, with dozens more in between, found their dreams of conquest shattered by the island’s fiercely independent spirit.\n\nDrive through the sheer cliffs, high mountain passes and deep gorges down to the south coast, where the beach town of Sougia remains untouched by mass tourism. Get a ferry or take a hike to ancient sites and even more remote beaches.\n\nFinally, head north to Hania, the evocative port town that oozes history within its Venetian-era walls.\n\nPlanning Tip: Distances on Crete can be deceiving. That seemingly short 60km (37-mile) jaunt from the touristy north to the untrammeled south will take much longer than you might expect. Roads curve sharply through the deeply eroded landscape, and the going can be very slow. And don’t expect many roadside signs to offer guidance; Cretans have yet to see a sign they didn’t shoot full of holes, a local source of pride and spirit.\n\nA drive into the Zagorohoria region will lead you to traditional villages tucked away in pristine mountains © Posnov / Getty Images\n\nNorthern wilds\n\nBest road trip to get off the beaten path\n\nThessaloniki–Sithonia; 880km (547 miles)\n\nGreece’s second city, Thessaloniki, is a wonderfully under-visited center for history, art, great food and intoxicating nightlife. Start here exploring the nation’s north, which borders a diverse range of neighboring countries and bears the influences of Macedonians, Romans, Byzantines, Slavs, Turks, and many more.\n\nDrive southwest to the fabled peak of Mt Olympus, Greece’s highest. A spiritual heart of the nation, you can drive up to its loftier elevations and go for hikes, both easy and world-class.\n\nStay in the mountains as you go west into the Zagorohoria region, which is dotted by tiny villages that have carried on across the millennia. Circle back towards Thessaloniki and finish your road trip at the unheralded but unmissable beaches of the Halkidiki Peninsula. Plunge deep into the very southeastern tip of remote Sithonia.\n\nTips for driving in Greece\n\nAlthough Greece follows EU conventions for driving regulations, there are some valuable things to remember as you drive around.",
    "2nd camp harboring terrorists in Greece opened next to Lavrion: Sources": "A second camp that is harboring terrorists was opened in Greece next to the existing notorious Lavrion camp, sources said amid increasing tensions between Ankara and Athens.\n\nA Turkish official told Daily Sabah that although Athens rejected claims that Lavrion has become a breeding ground for terrorists, Ankara has discovered another camp similar to Lavrion had been opened. “We are in a very fragile process,” the official said regarding bilateral ties.\n\nGreece has long been accused of being a favorite hideout for terrorists from the DHKP-C and PKK. Those fleeing Türkiye have taken shelter in refugee camps in Lavrion near Athens under the guise of being asylum-seekers, especially in the 1980s. Despite the closure of Lavrion in 2013 amid pressure from Türkiye, Greece continues to be the primary destination for DHKP-C terrorists.\n\nFootage from the camp shows that it has turned into a base for PKK terrorists.\n\nThe camp seen resembles a terrorist base, with terrorist symbols and pictures of its imprisoned ringleader Abdullah Öcalan adorning its walls.\n\nFurthermore, a diplomatic official had told Daily Sabah previously that “there is everything ranging from the DHKP-C, the PKK and FETÖ (Gülenist Terror Group) and the location of all of them is known.”\n\nThe aim is that these groups could be used one day against Türkiye, the official said. “An EU member country in the 21st century is openly feeding terrorists. The PKK is a terrorist group and designated as such by both the EU and the U.S,” explained the official.\n\n“Athens is not a transit country for terrorists anymore, but the direct target country.”\n\nAthens has also rejected Ankara’s extradition requests for terrorists from groups advocating armed insurgency against the state and had been involved in armed attacks against Turkish security forces and political parties, in addition to other targets.\n\nRejected extradition requests include members of the outlawed terrorist group The Revolutionary Left (Dev-Sol), members of the DHKP-C, the Turkish (or Kurdish) Hezbollah, the illegal Marxist-Leninist Communist Party (MLKP), the THKP-C, the PKK, the illegal Communist Party of Türkiye/Marxist-Leninist (TKP-ML) and from other groups.\n\nMost recently, Turkish police detained a PKK terrorist who received training at the notorious camp in Greece and had been planning to carry out armed and bomb attacks in large cities, Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu had announced.\n\nThe terrorist, identified as Hüsamettin Tanrıkulu, code-named “Delil,” was detained in a joint counterterrorism operation by Istanbul and Diyarbakır police.\n\nHe had entered Türkiye through illegal means after receiving sabotage training at the Lavrion camp in Greece.\n\nAthens permitting the existence of another camp harboring terrorists within its borders comes as relations between Türkiye and Greece hit a new low in recent months.\n\nTürkiye and Greece are at odds over a number of issues, including competing claims over jurisdiction in the Eastern Mediterranean, overlapping claims over their continental shelves, maritime boundaries, air space, energy, the ethnically split island of Cyprus, the status of the islands in the Aegean Sea and migrants.\n\nAnkara accuses Athens of illegally militarizing Greek islands in the East Aegean and questions Greece's sovereignty over them. There is also a dispute over the exploitation of mineral resources in the Aegean.\n\nAmong the most recent developments that flared tensions was the harassment by two Greek coast guard boats of a cargo ship in international waters, continued pushbacks by Greek elements recorded by Turkish unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as well as the harassment of Turkish fighter jets under a NATO mission by Greece’s Russian-made S-300s.\n\nIt was reported recently that Turkish jets on a reconnaissance mission, flying in international airspace, had been harassed by the Greek defense system stationed on Crete. Athens rejects the claims.\n\nTürkiye is planning to submit to NATO and its allies the radar logs showing how a Greek S-300 air defense system locked on to Turkish F-16 jets during a mission in international airspace, sources said last week. Türkiye has also lodged a protest and demanded an explanation and investigation from Greece into an incident that was \"totally in violation of international laws,\" according to Turkish diplomatic sources.\n\nMeanwhile, the Greek government wrote letters to NATO, the European Union and the United Nations, asking them to formally condemn what they claim is \"increasingly aggressive talk\" by Turkish officials in response to the continued Greek violations, and suggesting that tensions could escalate into open conflict.",

    "Greece urged to address anti-LGBTQI+ discrimination and intolerance": "Europe’s top human rights watchdog has urged Greece to take action against the “serious forms” of discrimination and intolerance faced by the country’s LGBTQI+ community, especially children in schools.\n\nEquality rights for intersex people often subject to sex “normalising” surgery at a young age must also be enhanced, according to a report released on Thursday by the Council of Europe.\n\n“Training should be introduced for teachers on how to address LGBTI-phobic intolerance and discrimination in schools while promoting understanding of and respect for LGBTI pupils,” it said. “As a matter of priority the authorities [should] take action to prevent intolerance and discrimination against intersex persons, in particular children.”\n\nDrawn up by the watchdog’s specialist body on racism and intolerance, ECRI, the report called for specific legislation to prohibit what it described as medically unnecessary sex “normalising” surgery and other non-therapeutic treatments “until such time as the intersex child is able to participate in the decision, based on the right to self-determination and on the principle of free and informed consent”.\n\nSingling out medical professionals who recommended abortion of intersex children to expecting parents, ECRI said it was vital that teachers and healthcare providers were given guidelines on intersex equality rights.\n\n“These efforts should include the preparation and production of further appropriate teaching materials and the establishing of school policies to prevent, monitor and respond to LGBTI-phobic incidents, including bullying,” the report’s authors wrote.\n\nGreece has made strides in recent years to improve minority rights. In the nearly six years that had elapsed since ECRI’s last assessment, it was noted that good practices had been made in a number of fields.\n\nThe centre-right Greek government, following groundbreaking legislation implemented by its leftwing predecessor – including civil unions for same-sex couples – had announced a 2021-25 national strategy for LGBTQI+ equality and, for the first time, placed openly gay individuals in official posts.\n\n“A further welcome step towards such equality is the inclusion of transgender persons in the Greek Manpower Employment Organisation’s (OAED) programmes for providing work for members of vulnerable groups,” the watchdog said. Similarly, a national action plan against racism and intolerance was adopted in 2020.\n\nBut as one of Europe’s most socially conservative societies, the Mediterranean country has faced criticism for its failure to properly implement policies and root out deep-seated homophobia espoused by leading members of the Greek Orthodox church. Bishops have publicly denounced homosexuality as a crime.\n\nThe killing of Zak Kostopoulos, a gay activist and drag performer, in broad daylight in Athens four years ago, did much to highlight a culture of abuse and impunity in the country’s police force. Amnesty International, which has previously accused Greek authorities of failing to properly protect LGBTQI+ people, described Kostopoulos’s death as an “assassination”, saying the victim and his family had been the targets of “stigmatisation, prejudice and hateful rhetoric” even after the brutal killing.\n\nProtesters marking the anniversary of Kostopoulos’s death marched through Athens late on Wednesday amid cries for justice to be meted out, after a controversial court decision to exonerate four police officers accused of causing fatal bodily harm.\n\nIn its most recent report, ECRI also underlined the worrying hate speech directed at refugees, asylum seekers, migrants and members of the Roma and LGBTQI+ communities in Greece, pointing out that politicians and even state officials indulged in discriminatory rhetoric that had no place in civil society. As such, it said, it was crucial that the Greek ombudsman, the country’s only recognised equality body, was allowed to provide aid and representation to victims of discrimination and intolerance in court.",
    "Türkiye commemorates victims of Greece's Tripolitsa massacre": "The Turkish president on Friday marked the anniversary of the Tripolitsa massacre committed by the Greeks during the Greek revolt that started in the Peloponnese in 1821, the year Greece separated from the Ottoman Empire.\n\nIn a Twitter post, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said Türkiye has not forgotten and will never forget the Tripolice Massacre, which took place on Sept. 23, 1821, \"in which thousands of Muslim Turks, our Albanian brothers and Jews were brutally and barbarically murdered.\"\n\nOn Sept. 23, 1821, tens of thousands of Muslims and Jews were massacred by the Greeks in Tripolitsa, a strategic city in the southern Peloponnese region of today’s Greece.\n\nTurks in Peloponnese faced not only death but also starvation and captivity. The Ottoman Jews living in the region also faced Greek atrocities and lost their lives due to famine, misery and plunder.\n\nTürkiye still criticizes Greece for its unwelcoming stance toward its Muslim population. For instance, up until recently, Athens was known as the only European capital without a mosque, even though there are an estimated 300,000 Muslims in the greater Athens area. Back in November 2020, for the first time since the 19th century, Athens witnessed the inauguration of an official mosque, as years of efforts by the Muslim community finally paid off.\n\nGreece was under the rule of the Ottoman Empire for centuries, until 1829 when the Greek population succeeded in gaining independence from the empire. At the time, there were many mosques and other Ottoman architecture all over Greece. However, the riots and independence triggered a wave during which all such architecture was damaged or removed, eventually leaving Athens without any mosque. In fact, Athens' lack of mosques is a norm for the majority of the Greek cities as the only officially sanctioned mosques in the country are in the northern border region with Turkey where up to 150,000 members of the Turkish minority live.\n\nTürkiye has long decried Greek violations of the rights of its Muslim and Turkish minority, from closing down mosques and letting historic mosques fall into disrepair, to refusing to recognize Muslims' election of their own muftis. These measures violate the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne as well as the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) verdicts, making Greece a state that flouts the law, Turkish officials say.\n\nSimilarly, the election of muftis, or Islamic clerics, by Muslims in Greece has become yet another point of contention that caused trouble for the Muslims in the country. Even though it is regulated by the 1913 Treaty of Athens, a Greek-Ottoman Empire pact that was implemented by Athens in 1920, that the community will be able to elect their own muftis, in 1991, in violation of international law, Greece annulled the treaty and unlawfully started to appoint the muftis itself. The muftis appointed by the Greek state have since usurped local Muslims' right of jurisdiction on family and inheritance matters. The majority of Muslim Turks in Western Thrace do not recognize muftis appointed by the Greek state and instead elect their own.",
    "Social attacks continue in Greece despite end of enhanced EU financial surveillance": "On August 20, the so-called enhanced financial surveillance of Greece by European Union (EU) lenders ended. After 12 years of austerity dictates and strict control of the Greek budget, the finance ministers of the eurozone countries and EU Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni voted in favour of this step.\n\nGreek and European politicians alike exceeded each other with their excessive flattery and promises. An “historic day for Greece and all Greeks,” proclaimed Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis of the right-wing conservative Nea Dimokratia (ND), predicting a new beginning “full of growth, unity and prosperity.”\n\nGreek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis at the Thessaloniki International Fair on Sept. 10 [AP Photo/Giannis Papanikos]\n\nEU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted that Greece could now close this chapter “thanks to the determination and resilience” of its people and “look to the future with confidence.”\n\nTo decipher the phrases, replace “prosperity” with poverty, “confidence in the future” with fear of job loss, “resilience” with suffering and hardship. What is being celebrated here as a chapter closed and an historic new beginning means the Greek population faces the continuation of austerity and aggravation of the social crisis over further decades.\n\nThe cost of the loans of almost €289 billion that Greece received from the EU in three “memorandum” programs in recent years was paid by the working class with income losses of 25 percent, mass unemployment and pension cuts. With public debt at 189.3 percent of GDP in the first quarter of 2022, the country remains at the top of the EU debt table. According to Eurostat, Greece recorded the highest youth unemployment rate (28.6 percent) and the second highest unemployment rate (11.4 percent) after Spain in the month of July.\n\nSince the financial crisis of 2008, the EU, under German leadership, has used Greece as the spearhead of its austerity policies. Within a few years, with the help of the trade unions and pseudo-left parties, led by the Syriza government (2015-2019), it broke the strong resistance of the working class and lowered living standards to the level of a developing country. In response to the pandemic and NATO’s proxy war in Ukraine, European governments are building on the Greek experience and intensifying social attacks across Europe.\n\nWhat does the end of “enhanced surveillance” mean? The mechanism had been adopted in 2018 for a period of four years following Greece’s formal exit from the so-called “bailout” programs of the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Central Bank (ECB)—the “Troika” for short. Greece had to continue to pass regular quarterly budget audits by creditors in order to obtain debt relief and access to the capital market. Now, far from ending this scrutiny, there will only be a transition to “simple surveillance,” with semi-annual rather than quarterly reviews.\n\nLike other European countries, including Ireland, Spain, Cyprus and Portugal, Greece will remain under EU control until 75 percent of its loans are paid off. According to the Greek newspaper Ethnos that would be in 2059, following current calculations, and as late as 2070 according to other sources. That means that for up to 50 more years, the EU’s dictates will continue, inevitably involving austerity measures and privatization.\n\nThe latest move gives Greece greater budgetary freedom, but it will not be to the benefit of the working class. Above all, the Greek elite—as well as Europe’s corporations and banks—have in mind incentives for investments and lucrative business deals. Greek Finance Minister Christos Staikouras stressed that the new regulation would strengthen the country’s position on the world market and make it more attractive to investors.\n\nThe EU had ordered a rigorous privatization policy and the systematic erosion of the welfare state, labour laws and the right to strike in order to turn Greece into a low-wage country. Having bled the country dry economically and socially, transnational corporations are falling over the spoils like vultures. Governments of all political stripes, especially the previous government under Syriza, privatized state-owned assets on a massive scale, selling them off to international companies and shareholders on favourable terms.\n\nThis month, the privatization process for the ports of Igoumenitsa and Alexandroupoli is entering the next round. While the former is an important link to Italy, the latter is currently of great geopolitical significance. The northern Greek port of Alexandroupoli serves as a hub for NATO arms deliveries to Ukraine in the war against Russia. The sale of state-owned natural gas company DEPA Infrastructure, which owns stakes in 7,500 kilometres of gas networks, to Italy’s Italgas was also completed in early September.\n\nMitsotakis also hopes to attract large investments via closer ties with reactionary regimes such as the al-Sisi dictatorship in Egypt and the Gulf monarchy of the United Arab Emirates, with which he negotiated a Strategic Partnership in 2020 and signed 12 agreements and the establishment of an investment fund this year.\n\nGerman corporations are also benefiting. Frankfurt-based flight operator Fraport bought the rights to 14 Greek regional airports. IT companies are taking advantage of access to cheap skilled labour, including Göppingen-based software company Teamviewer, which in 2020 opened a site in the city of Ioannina in northern Epirus, one of Greece’s poorest regions. Companies such as Essen-based utility RWE, Bremen-based solar and wind farm developer wpd and Germany’s largest wind turbine manufacturer Enercon are also getting involved in the wind energy and solar markets.\n\nWhile rents and housing expenses for Greek workers rose rapidly in 2022, especially in metropolitan areas such as Athens, the luxury real estate market in Greece is celebrating a record year, according to real estate agency Sotheby’s International Realty, with wealthy buyers coming mainly from the United Kingdom, United States and France.\n\nThe Greek government boasts of economic growth of 8 percent of GDP last year and an expected 4 percent in 2022. It is using this as window dressing, which has little to do with the real situation, to distract attention in the run-up to next year’s elections from the deep political crisis that has gripped it and the entire ruling class. ND is not only shaken by a far-reaching wiretapping scandal that is exposing the authoritarian tendencies of its rule. It also fears an escalation of social tensions in the face of skyrocketing prices for food, electricity, and heating gas.\n\nIn his opening speech at the Thessaloniki International Trade Fair, which ran this week, Mitsotakis promised a package of €5.5 billion for 2022 and 2023. This includes minimal special payments for low-income earners, families, pensioners, farmers and students, as well as relief for businesses, funding for the tourism industry and higher salaries for the armed forces, according to Euronews.\n\nThe official inflation rate was 11.4 percent in August. According to the latest figures from the Greek Statistical Office, bread and cereal products cost 18.5 percent more, dairy products 18 percent, and oils 25.5 percent. Travel costs also rose rapidly: airline tickets were 71 percent more expensive, ship tickets 25.4 percent and taxis around 33 percent—and that in a country with countless islands, where many people rely on ship and air transport. Even before the Ukraine war, prices for most foodstuffs were at the same level as in Germany, while the official minimum monthly wage is only about a third at €663 euros.\n\nAs in other European countries, the price explosions in the energy sector are particularly glaring: the price of natural gas rose by 261.3 percent in one year, heating oil by 65 percent and electricity by 38.5 percent.\n\nIn early September, speaking on Mega TV, Adonis Georgiadis, Minister of Development and Investment, warned of the “worst winter since 1942” and blamed the situation on “Putin’s energy war against Europe.” Georgiadis—a well-known right-winger who began his career as a historian and publisher and was a deputy for the ultra-right Laos Party before joining ND—knows exactly what he is talking about.\n\nUnder the yoke of Nazi occupation in Greece during World War II, tens of thousands died in the 1941-1942 Winter of Hunger. The Nazis had plundered the economy for their military campaigns and starved the population. During the unusually cold winter, many people also froze to death because fuel was confiscated. The gruesome images of emaciated starving people and piles of corpses in the capital Athens still make one shudder today.\n\nWith his comparison to the winter famine of 1941/1942, Georgiadis is directing an open threat to the Greek population. Not Putin, but the sanctions and rearmament mania of the NATO powers has led to the collapse of gas supplies from Russia and the price speculation of powerful corporate monopolies.\n\nGreece is one of the closest allies of the US and Germany in the war, spending 3.59 percent of GDP on its military apparatus even before the outbreak of war in 2021, according to NATO figures—more than all other NATO countries, including the US. On Friday, the Greek Defence Ministry confirmed the start of a so-called back-fill operation with Germany. Athens will supply Ukraine with 40 Soviet-designed BMP-1 tanks. In return, Greece will receive 40 Marder infantry fighting vehicles from Berlin.\n\nThe burden of the war policy is to be shouldered by working people. That is why they are already being prepared for a new “winter of hunger.”\n\nThe fascistic attitude contained in the government’s reaction to the human emergency could be seen on Tuesday when Deputy Minister of the Interior Stelios Petsas addressed the media. On the morning program on the ANT television channel, he referred to the gigantic increase in the price of natural gas and urged households with a natural gas supply to make an expensive switch to heating oil (whose price is also increasing sharply). When asked by a journalist if there will be solutions provided for affected households, he said, “In these cases, the main thing is to show adaptation. Those who don’t want to adapt will unfortunately die.”\n\nThis is the Social Darwinist logic of survival of the fittest in the “struggle for existence” pursued by the Greek ruling class in the last three years of the pandemic, with its herd immunity policy of allowing infections to run wild, and in the preceding years of austerity policies under the dictates of the Troika.\n\nPetsas’ statements triggered an outcry on social media and an exchange of blows with the opposition Syriza party in parliament. In fact, however, he was merely stating bluntly what has been the mindset of the Greek elite and international capital for years. In order for stock market profits to continue to soar, workers are supposed to starve, freeze and die. Or as Marx once wrote, “To the outcry as to the physical and mental degradation, the premature death, the torture of overwork, it [capital] answers: Ought these to trouble us since they increase our profits?”\n\nWith the same determination with which the capitalist class defends its profits, workers must take up the struggle and prevent a winter of war and hunger. For this they need a socialist perspective and their own party. Contact the WSWS to prepare for the formation of a Greek section of the International Committee of the Fourth International.",

    "Diaspora Greeks discover Greece": "In the last two to three years, something unprecedented and particularly optimistic has happened. Thousands of our compatriots from the distant diasporas of the US, Australia and Canada have discovered Greece. To some extent, this happened because of the coronavirus pandemic. Our country stood out in the way it dealt with it, while there were quite a few people who decided to come to Greece and work from here.\n\nAt the same time, the country’s brand improved dramatically, becoming fashionable again, after many decades. It is impressive how popular Greek destinations are in the US and Canada. But the trend is being led by people who have nothing to do with what we used to think of as the “uncle from Brooklyn.” We are talking about the second- and third-generation Greeks who have studied and improved spectacularly in terms of education and living standards.\n\nBut these people also come to their country and are surprised to find that Greece is not the “poor relation” that they had in their minds from their grandparents’ time. It is a country with a high level of services in some areas, with roads and infrastructure much better than those of big American cities and people who combine professionalism with warmth. They are enthusiastic about what they discover, from Greek wines to museums and of course the more relaxed way of life. They visit their ancestral villages and search for their roots. Some go a step further and try to find out how to acquire Greek citizenship.\n\nFor years we have been looking for ways to bring the diaspora closer to the homeland. Over the years, it became clear that this cannot be done through state-fed pharaonic schemes. After all, the basic condition for their return was to make Greece more attractive for them. Of course, the ties with the country were maintained and, in difficult times, various organizations played a decisive role by bring young diaspora Greeks either for the summer or for a year of university studies.\n\nBut what we are seeing now is a new phenomenon. It fills us with joy and optimism because our compatriots are returning to their places of origin and are Greece’s best possible representatives and ambassadors.\n\nYou hear them talk about the country and you feel like you’re getting an antidote to the usual domestic misery and cynicism that – unfortunately – manages to gobble up even the usually forgiving Greek sun.",
    "Conor McMenamin cleared over video and recalled by Northern Ireland": "He will face no further action regarding an historic video in which he appeared to sing a pro-IRA slogan.\n\nThe 27-year-old Glentoran winger was withdrawn from Ian Baraclough's squad shortly before Saturday's 2-1 win over Kosovo after the video emerged.\n\nHowever, given that the footage is believed to be almost a decade old and the former Cliftonville and Linfield player was punished by his club at the time, the Irish FA allowed him to travel to Athens on Sunday while a independent disciplinary committee considered whether he had breached IFA rules.\n\nMcMenamin has now been cleared and joined his team-mates in training on Monday evening ahead of the crunch fixture against Greece, in which Northern Ireland need to avoid defeat to be sure of not dropping into a relegation play-off.\n\nMcMenamin was withdrawn a day after striker Kyle Lafferty was sent home amid an investigation by his club Kilmarnock into a video appearing to show him using alleged sectarian language, but that was understood to have been recorded only last week.\n\nMcMenamin's reinstatement for the Greece game will given him the opportunity to add to the three caps he earned in June after an outstanding season with Glentoran last term was rewarded with his first international call-up.\n\nSpeaking after Saturday's 2-1 win over Kosovo, Northern Ireland manager Ian Baraclough had said he hoped historic videos would not become a recurring problem for the team.\n\n\"It's a distraction you'd rather not have,\" Baraclough said. \"To happen so close to kick-off time, I thought we did the right things in pulling Conor out of the squad.

    "Group of countries – Greece among them – to push EU for gas price cap": "The European Commission cannot be blamed for keeping Greece in check after it spent money it could ill-afford on handouts. [Reuters]\n\nA group of European Union countries want to push Brussels to produce plans this week for a bloc-wide cap on the price of gas, according to a draft letter seen by Reuters.\n\nThe EU proposed a package of emergency measures to tackle soaring energy prices earlier this month, but has steered clear of a gas price cap, an idea which has split the bloc’s 27 member states.\n\nCountries in favour plan to step up pressure on Brussels, with a letter asking the European Commission to make proposals on a gas price cap for discussion at a meeting of EU energy ministers on Friday, followed by a legislative proposal as soon as possible.\n\n“We acknowledge the efforts made by the Commission and the measures it has put forward to face the crisis. But we have yet to tackle the most serious problem of all: the wholesale price of natural gas,” said a draft of the letter, seen by Reuters.\n\nEU officials said around 10 countries are considering signing the letter, with Belgium, Italy, Poland, Malta and Greece among them.\n\nAddressed to EU energy commissioner Kadri Simson, the draft letter called for a price cap on all wholesale gas transactions. Diplomats were negotiating over the letter on Monday, and its contents could still change.\n\nThe draft said capping gas prices would help countries rein “untenable inflationary pressures” hitting households and businesses, and could be designed in a way that ensures security of supply.\n\nOther states oppose capping gas prices, raising doubts as to whether any EU proposal would win sufficient support.\n\nGermany, the Netherlands and Denmark say capping prices could endanger the security of supply by undermining the EU’s ability to attract gas deliveries this winter.\n\nRussia has slashed gas deliveries to Europe since the West imposed sanction on Moscow invaded Ukraine, leaving countries scrambling to secure alternative supplies.\n\nSo far, the European Commission has proposed emergency EU measures including windfall profit levies on energy firms, and cuts in electricity use.\n\nEU countries are negotiating those proposals and aim to approve them when EU energy ministers meet on Friday.\n\nMeanwhile, other EU proposals are in the works – including liquidity support for energy firms, and extra measures to bring down gas prices.\n\nThe Commission had been expected to publish an update this week on the new measures it is exploring, but EU officials said on Monday this was now expected in early October.

    "Greece: Pushbacks by Sea and Land, Türkiye an Increasingly ‘Unsafe Third Country’": "Brutal pushbacks continue off the Aegean islands and in the Evros region. The situation for Syrian refugees in Türkiye deemed safe by Greek authorities is rapidly deteriorating.\n\nReports of non-response and pushbacks by Greek authorities by sea and land continue. According to Aegean Boat Report, the Greek authorities and Hellenic Coast Guard remained unresponsive to alerts of 49 people in distress off Samos on a rubber boat taking in water. On the same day, the organisation warned of 44 Palestinians “in imminent danger of being pushed back by Greek authorities” after arriving on the island of Agathonisi. The NGO hotline Alarm Phone has published detailed testimonies from a group of 29 people pushed back by Greek authorities in August after being pulled to Rhodes and pushed towards Turkish waters. A survivor describes the brutal incident where Greek officials: “took our phones, beat us up heavily and took our personal belongings. (I could hide my phone, so one phone was left with our whole group). Then, the Hellenic Coast Guard took 2 people of us (both Syrian nationals) and beat them up very hard and kept them there. Since then we don’t know anything about the 2 people – we have no contact to them anymore”. A young Turkish man went missing on 8 September while crossing the Evros river separating Greece and Türkiye. After arriving safely in Greece, he was detained along with other people seeking protection, loaded onto the same rubber boat they had arrived on where the young man lost his balance and disappeared in the water. On 11 September, Alarm Phone reported of: “a group of around 80 asylum seekers in prison in Greece, close to Evros. Several of them are in severe medical conditions and are being held in squalid conditions!”. The organisation later confirmed that the group had been held at Isaakio border guard station along with hundreds of other people and had been pushed back to Turkey. While the Greek government denies pushbacks it has reported “averting” 150,000 irregular arrivals in 2022. As of 11 September, 10,139 people had arrived in Greece in 2022 – 5,742 by sea and 4,397 by land.\n\nGreece deems Türkiye a safe third country for people originating from the main refugee-producing countries including Syria, allowing authorities to refuse asylum claims as inadmissible. However, the already difficult situation for the more than 3,6 million Syrian refugees in Türkiye is rapidly deteriorating. According to Le Monde, a crackdown is intensifying and raising mounting concern among Syrian refugees who are “facing increasing administrative difficulties as the government enforces tougher measures”. This development is taking place in the context of an emerging economic crisis in Türkiye and increasingly more extreme rhetoric from nationalist politicians. Sadly, such rhetoric resonates with the population and reportedly 82 per cent of the population demands Syrians to return home. According to Der Spiegel, President Erdogan has turned on Syrian refugees and hundreds of thousands of people are arrested and deported at gunpoint by Turkish authorities. Turkish media reports that 25,000 Syrians left Türkiye for the EU over recent months due to rising anti-refugee sentiments – 10,000 through resettlement and 15,000 Syrians who travelled through other means. “Many of the people around me are preparing to leave again, to go to Europe,” said Zaynab from Idlib (northwestern Syria), adding: “To some extent, we’re reliving the experience of 2015”. Reportedly, a group of Syrian refugees are planning a caravan to the EU via an online channel followed by almost 70,000 people with organizers calling on people to bring sleeping bags, tents, life jackets, water, canned food and first aid kits. The number of migrants and refugees who cross from Türkiye into Bulgaria has increased substantially. Border authorities have recorded 85,000 arrivals over the first eight months of 2022 which is more than double the number for the whole of 2021.\n\nFor further information:\n\nThis article appeared in the ECRE Weekly Bulletin.

    "‘Speak out against pushbacks, you’re an enemy of Greece,’ says refugee hero": "Once lauded as a Greek hero, Iasonas Apostolopoulos has seen the effects of being on the wrong side of his government’s policies around the illegal pushbacks on its borders, accused by the prime minister’s office of “insulting Greece”.\n\n“If love of country means accepting the killing of refugees on our border, then I’m proud to be a traitor,” he says.\n\nThe 38-year-old, once celebrated for his efforts in rescuing refugees off the Greek coast, has in the past year been mysteriously denied a medal he was due to be awarded by the Greek president and publicly accused of insulting his country, by the prime minister’s spokesperson, for speaking out about illegal pushbacks of asylum seekers from Greece’s borders.\n\nApostolopoulos, who trained as a civil engineer, initially learned the ropes of search and rescue in Lesbos in 2015 from Greek fishers and has since been on numerous missions with aid organisations to rescue refugees in the Mediterranean.\n\nIn July 2021, he was notified he would be awarded a medal by the Greek president, Katerina Sakellaropoulou, for his work. Shortly before the ceremony, however, he says he was informed in a late-night telephone call from the Greek foreign ministry that his award had been cancelled. Apostolopoulos was never given a reason but media reports at the time suggested pressure had been exerted by the government to withdraw the honour.\n\n“If you speak out against pushbacks, you’re an ‘enemy of Greece’ – this is the narrative,” says Apostolopoulos, who has criticised the government’s migration policy and highlighted news reports of asylum seekers being robbed, beaten and pushed back across land and sea borders by the Greek authorities. The practice of pushing back migrants, widely documented by human rights organisations, violates international and national law.\n\nIn February, the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, said it had noted almost 540 reports of “informal returns” of asylum seekers across the borders since 2020 but the Greek authorities continue to rebut allegations of lawbreaking. In a recent appearance at the European parliament, the Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, pointed the finger firmly at Turkey. “I would urge you to think more in terms of ‘push forwards’ rather than pushbacks,” he said, suggesting that the Turkish authorities were encouraging people to cross into Greek territory.\n\nIn August, a group of 38 asylum seekers were picked up by Greek authorities after being stranded for days on an islet at the land border between Greece and Turkey, during which time a five-year-old child died. The group claim to have been pushed back and forth across the border for weeks by the authorities in both countries.\n\nA week later, the Greek government announced that it would extend the fence at the land border with Turkey to cover the entire length of the frontier – about 136 miles.\n\nIn an increasingly tense atmosphere, Apostolopoulos has been receiving daily death threats on social media, but he says he will continue to use his platform to raise awareness about violence at Europe’s borders. “Pushbacks are designed to stay invisible. I think the only way to stop this crime is to give visibility to it,” he says.\n\nRacism and violence against the weak are poisoning every aspect of our society Iasonas Apostolopoulos\n\nThere is a sense of sadness as he reflects on all that was done to help refugees on the Aegean islands, efforts that were recognised when islanders were nominated for a Nobel peace prize in 2016. “It was a national pride of Greece,” he says, “the idea of ‘philoxenia’ – the Greek word translating to ‘love of the stranger’.”\n\nNow, violence against asylum seekers at Greece’s borders has become top of the agenda for EU officials, including the home affairs commissioner, Ylva Johansson, who tweeted in June that “violent and illegal deportations of migrants [in Greece] must stop now”, adding that EU funding was “linked to EU fundamental rights being correctly applied”.\n\nTineke Strik, a Dutch MEP from the Greens/EFA group, is one of those who have been calling for further scrutiny about funds given to countries such as Greece for border management, raising concerns that the EU may be directly fuelling human rights violations such as pushbacks.\n\n“They [Greece] really enjoy complete impunity from the EU,” she says. “I blame the commission for that,” adding that further funding of border management should be conditional on respect for fundamental rights. “We are really pressing [Brussels] to take that very seriously.”\n\nStrik also raised concerns about the targeting of humanitarians, such as Apostolopoulos, in Greece.\n\n“This impunity actually fuels other things, for instance the criminalisation of search and rescuers, NGOs and journalists. If, from an EU level, nothing is said, then governments try to silence everyone in the country who criticise them.\n\n“In Greece, you see increasingly the patterns that we have seen in Hungary for a long time and in Poland as well. I would say, if we do not intervene in Greece now, it will be more and more difficult to combat it,” she says.\n\n“Racism and violence against the weak are poisoning every aspect of our society,” says Apostolopoulos. “For now, refugees are the ones who are being mostly targeted in Europe but sooner or later all this hatred will be fuelled against others who are less privileged.”\n\nSign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:",
    "Greece’s organic food products could compete in markets abroad, minister says": "A national funding plan to support organic production worth 705 million euros will benefit over 60,000 producers and livestock farmers, Agricultural Development & Food Minister Giorgos Georgantas said on the sidelines of SerExpo Fair in northern Greece.\n\nGeorgantas was speaking at a meeting on organic foods (known as “biological foods” in Greek) held by the ministry’s Secretariat General of EU Resources and Infrastructure and the Chamber of Serres.\n\nThe minister said that of the 705 million euros, 305 million euros was earmarked for organic livestock farming, he added. “The biodiversity of Greek soil has produced Greek meat that is unique in taste and quality, anyway – it would be wrong not to support the development of organic livestock farming,” he underlined. Greece is in a position to adapt its production to European Union targets for organic produce and would have a competitive edge with its organic products abroad as well.\n\nOrganic fish cultivation also offers similar prospects, Georgantas further said, especially if linked to tourism. The ministries of Agriculture and Education, he suggested, could develop programs to promote organic production nationally, building the consumer generation of the 2030s.\n\nThe expo is taking place in Serres from September 21 to 25.\n\nThanks for reading Hellenic News of America Subscribe to HNA\n\nSOURCE; ANA-MPA",
    "Greece to launch parliamentary inquiry into spy scandal": "Greece is to launch a parliamentary inquiry into a spy scandal embroiling the government as MEPs also step up calls for an investigation into the use of phone taps in the country.\n\nAn inquiry proposed by the centre-left Pasok party was backed by the entire political opposition late on Monday after revelations that the group’s leader, Nikos Androulakis, had been placed under surveillance while serving as an MEP.\n\n“It is necessary more than ever for these cases to be investigated,” the Pasok MP Haris Kastanidis told the chamber, saying the inquiry should not be limited to Androulakis. Eavesdropping claims made by the communist KKE party as well as the bugging of journalists should also be addressed, he said.\n\nThe centre-right government has faced charges of a cover-up by liberal and leftwing MEPs, who are pressing for a fact-finding mission to be sent to Greece. Lawmakers with the ruling New Democracy party abstained from Monday’s vote although they made clear that they, too, supported the inquiry in the name of reforming Greece’s intelligence service, the EYP.\n\nThe wiretap disclosures have been described as “probably the tip of the iceberg” by Sophie in ‘t Veld, a Dutch politician heading the European parliament’s PEGA committee looking into the use of malicious spyware across the continent.\n\n“The Greek authorities, on the one hand, claim they are innocent so they’ve got nothing to hide, and on the other hand they are very reluctant to shed light on the whole matter,” she said. “And so far all their moves over the last year or so have been to cover things up.”\n\nThe Androulakis affair is expected to be raised on Tuesday when the 38-member PEGA committee holds the first of two hearings this week on “spyware against citizens”.\n\nEarlier this year, it emerged that the phones of the financial journalist Thanasis Koukakis had been monitored with Predator spyware, manufactured by Cytrox, a surveillance start-up based in North Macedonia. The malware, which has the ability to read encrypted data and turn a mobile phone into a listening device, was also deployed against Androulakis but the attempted hack failed because the politician failed to activate the necessary clickbait. The software was discovered when the MEP, who was subsequently targeted by EYP, sent his mobile phone to the European parliament’s cybersecurity department for a routine check.\n\nThe scandal threatens political turmoil in the run-up to elections next year amid calls from the former premier and main opposition head, Alexis Tsipras, for the prime minister to resign.\n\nKyriakos Mitsotakis 54, who has vowed to see out his full four-year term, citing the need for stability at a time of global uncertainty and rising tensions with Turkey, has said he was unaware of the bugging operation. “I have looked the Greek people in the eye and I have assured them that I knew absolutely nothing. It is my word against yours,” he said, turning to Tsipras during a heated debate in Athens’ 300-seat parliament on Friday.\n\nFrom the outset, Mitsotakis has accepted the surveillance of his political opponent was wrong. In a surprise step, his office announced the resignations on 7 August of Greece’s spy chief, Panagiotis Kontoleon – going so far as to publicly chastise the intelligence service for “incorrect actions” – and Grigoris Dimitriadis, the leader’s nephew and powerful chief of staff.\n\nMitsotakis has also suggested that the revelations are the result of “dark forces” bent on destabilising Greece.\n\nWith rising energy costs and economic worries topping the agenda, officials insist the disclosures have done little to dent the administration’s popularity.\n\nA report issued by Google’s threat analysis group in May said the product was used by “government-backed actors” in several states, including Greece. Mitsotakis has rejected any suggestion of Predator being used by the Greek authorities, although the software is known to be packaged by Intellexa, a firm based in Athens and registered in Cyprus.\n\nIn one of his first moves after winning power in July 2019, Mitsotakis placed EYP under the aegis of the prime minister’s office and not the interior ministry, as had previously been the case. The direct line of communication has also played a role in the criticism being levelled against the leader.\n\nSurveillance is by no means a new feature of the Greek state, where memories of such practices during the 1967-74 military dictatorship have yet to fade among the older generation.\n\nUnder Tsipras, wiretapping also increased, with the then government taking the step of reducing the number of prosecutors required to approve permits. Addressing parliament on behalf of the ruling New Democracy (ND) party on Monday, the MP Dimitris Keridis said the inquiry should also include the period when Syriza was in power.\n\nThe committee, which will sit in closed session, is dominated by ND MPs.\n\nThe number of wiretaps placed on citizens for reasons of “national security” have allegedly soared since Mitsotakis assumed office. The independent telecoms watchdog, ADAE, has referred to 15,000 eavesdropping requests being made last year alone.\n\n“Other revelations are bound to follow,” said Stelios Koulouglou, a Syriza party MEP who also sits on the PEGA committee. “What has been happening in Greece reminds me of the tactics pursued by the Stasi in east Germany. Mitsotakis’s aim was complete control and under [his purview] surveillance was broadened and became extremely systematic.”",

    "How Bitcoin ATMs in Greece fare during a record-breaking tourist season": "Greece is globally recognized for its touristic lures of idyllic beaches and a laid-back lifestyle. Prior to the outbreak of the global pandemic, the World Travel and Tourism Council said that tourism generated over one-fifth of Greece’s total GDP.\n\nThis year, the country faced a record number of travelers during its summer tourism season. In the month of August alone, the country received nearly 1 million travel arrivals per week, according to the Greek Minister of Tourism Vassilis Kikilias.\n\nA report from ForwardKeys on this year’s summer tourism revealed that, of the top ten “sun and beach” locations in Europe, Greece held six spaces. These included the island destinations of Mykonos, Thira (Santorini) and Heraklion (Crete), as well as Thessaloniki. Athens, the country’s capital, took third place for “urban” destinations in Europe.\n\nOf the 27 European Union member states, Greece takes the sixth spot in terms of cryptocurrency ATMs, with 64 active for usage. Over half of Greece’s crypto ATMs are shared between Athens and Thessaloniki.\n\nHowever, the Bitcoin ATM operator BCash strategically placed some of its ATMs in the country’s trendy island destinations of Mykonos, Santorini and Crete. Cointelegraph spoke with the managing director and co-founder of BCash, Dimitrios Tsangalidis, on how crypto is impacted by or itself impacts the tourism season in Greece.\n\nAlthough Mykonos and Santorini are the most visited tourist destinations, the mainland ATMs have the majority of traffic, according to Tsangalidis — especially central Athens, where the first ATM was installed, and Thessaloniki.\n\nHowever, the co-founder noted that in Crete, the country’s most populated island and a popular tourist destination, there is a \"very loyal cryptocurrency crowd.\"\n\n“There is a strong crypto community in Heraklion of Crete [which is] the location of one of our ATMs.\"\n\nIn Heraklion, the capital of Crete, the local start-up accelerator H2B Hub collaborated with the Greek-speaking University of Nicosia to create and support a local blockchain community.\n\nBoth Athens and Thessaloniki have active, regular meetups for the crypto and blockchain community.\n\nWhile tourism bolsters parts of the Greek economy, according to Tsangalidis, it doesn’t translate to the crypto scene. “Unfortunately, the absolute opposite happens,” says Tsangalidis.\n\n“In summer months and high tourist seasons, the demand drops. But we are in the middle of crypto winter that came earlier this year, so it is really hard to tell.\"\n\nEspecially in terms of regular traffic, the decrease can also be equated to locals leaving for vacation.\n\nRelated: Tourists flock to El Salvador despite Bitcoin bear market\n\nIn general, Greece needs more awareness of cryptocurrencies and their utility in everyday life, Tsangalidis sums up.\n\n“Influence on local tourism can be noticeable only if there is a general adoption of cryptocurrency within society.”\n\nHe adds that for now, there is little to no infrastructure or adoption from the level of Greek businesses and local governments. “If our government will become crypto friendly and if a green light will be given to businesses, then adoption will follow.”\n\nIn May of this year, the president of the Greek National Tourism Organization, Angela Gerekou, said the country is currently exploring how blockchain technology can bring about safety and transparency in tourism.",

    "Greece goes Putin Putin, and pro-Russia party is all set to take over Athens": "Kyriakos Mitsotakis is one of Europe’s most unpopular leaders. In his tenure, Athens has just added insult to Greece’s injury. The economy is in complete tatters, Turkey is heckling Greece like there is no tomorrow, whereas, Mitsotakis himself is drowning in a pool of scandals. If elections are to be held today, he will lose all his ground. However, time puts everything in place. Greece’s ruling party is now officially trying to call the shots and leave their liberal disguise.\n\nAccording to a news report by Euractiv, Greece’s ruling New Democracy party is looking for an alliance with the “Greek Solution”, a greek party known for its pro-Russian stance.\n\nReportedly, Greek Minister of Domestic Affairs Makis Voridis has confirmed that New Democracy might walk into elections with a Greek solution. The minister stated, “We don’t exclude anyone. Besides the parties whose programs are completely different than ours, we can work with all parties”.\n\nThe next general elections are scheduled for 2023, however, demand is growing to call early elections in the wake of Mitsotakis’ decaying popularity. The “Watergate” controversy, involving the secret services of Greece monitoring opposition politicians and journalists, has pushed New Democracy into a difficult position.\n\nGiven the fact that Mitsotakis’ popularity has fallen, political analysts are predicting that a coalition government will be required in order to form a majority administration in 2023. Mitsotakis, himself though, is no great fan of Greek solutions. He has constantly turned down talks of any collaboration with the Greek Solution. But it seems that his party is testing the waters.\n\nLovers of Russia\n\nClearly, Mitsotakis and his Party leaders appear to have a conflict of interest here. However, it doesn’t matter for New Democracy at this point because Mitsotakis is losing credibility.\n\nNow, when we talk of the Greek Solution, their stance on Russia could be a page-turner for Greece. Greek solution is a party that has not hidden its pro-Russian feelings. Its leader, Kyriakos Velopoulos, has openly criticized the EU’s decision to send weapons to Ukraine, saying that Greece “needs its last bullet”.\n\nAt the inception of the Ukraine war, he told the Greek parliament: “In a war, you are with the defender. You are with the victim, with the crying children… Ukraine is not our friendly country, as Kyiv tweeted in favor of Turkish drones and Turkish friendship.”\n\nHe has even backed Russia as the Ukraine war dragged on. Velopoulos stated: “Yes, Putin made Russia. It is a truth. Is he authoritarian, or his country, he is a leader. We admired what he did [to create Russia]; we do not admire and condemn what he is doing now [with Ukraine]”.\n\nRead More: Greece and Russia are just one step away from snatching the Turkish straits\n\nAlarm for Turkey and NATO\n\nIf New Democracy links its ties with the Greek Solution, the whole political scenario of Greece will change. The new government of Greece would be making a complete U-turn of all its actions in Ukraine. Mitsotakis as prime minister has always styled himself as a moderate and pro-U.S. politician. However, his recent acts suggest that staunch conservatism is not far from the Hellenic Parliament.\n\nAlong with that, Athens is already leaving no stone unturned to thwart Turkey. Just a few days ago, Greece was armed to teeth with Russia’s S-300 defence system to take down Turkish Jets wandering in Greece’s airspace.\n\nWhereas, just a week ago, Greece officially warned NATO to take care of Turkey or else the government won’t hesitate to answer Turkey’s unprovoked, unacceptable insult to Greece and the Greek people.\n\nRead More: Erdogan loses his war against Greece even before the war actually started\n\nA pro-Russia party is all set to take over Athens, though, there is still time. Consequently, New Democracy is mulling over a coalition with the Greek Solution. This coalition would mark yet another staunch hardliner of the West marching towards power. NATO, the EU, and Turkey would thus be forced to make a Hobson’s choice over whether to ignore Greece or lock horns with it just like Budapest or Rome.",
    "Greece’s 2023 draft budget foresees lower taxes, extends lower VAT to more items, services": "Greece’s draft state budget for 2023 is expected to be finalized this coming week, before its tabling in Parliament on October 3.\n\nBasic features include lower taxes for citizens, particularly for pensioners and civil servants, by abolishing of a solidarity tax, and increases in salaries. The revenues lost will be replaced exclusively by the growing economy and control of tax evasion.\n\nThe draft budget also foresees a primary deficit, but its estimate will not be finalized until the European Union decides on whether to continue with an escape clause, due to high inflation and large fiscal necessities of supporting society.\n\nFinance Ministry sources said the government needs to balance the need to support citizens with the need to appear fiscally responsible to international markets, as its goal is to become investment-grade within 2023.\n\nRecent statements by Finance Minister Christos Staikouras revealed that the GDP will increase by 5.3% this year (from 3.1% foreseen in the budget), against 3.1% of the EU average, while the economy’s growth will settle at 2.1% for 2023 against the EU average of 0.9%.\n\nThe total of interventions announced by Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis at the annual Thessaloniki International Fair that took place this month is 3.2 billion euros.\n\nThis includes abolishing a solidarity tax on all revenues as of January 1, 2023 (1.24 billion euros); raising main pensions of 1.5 million pensioners by 6% (at least 600 mln euros); tax cuts for businesses hiring more full-time people for at least 3 months (introduced already on Sept. 1); a 50% in subsidies for student housing; extending low VAT to transport, coffee, non-alcoholic beverages, gyms, dance schools, films and tourism packages to June 2023 (246 mln euros); and continuing, if circumstances allow, the subsidisy of heating oil by about 0.25 euro/liter into 2023, beyond its current expiration at the end of 2022.\n\nThanks for reading Hellenic News of America Subscribe to HNA\n\nSOURCE; ANA-MPA",
    "Spying scandal clouds Greece’s political future": "Press play to listen to this article Voiced by Amazon Polly\n\nATHENS — A persistent espionage scandal has upended Greece’s political landscape, fueling doubts the country can form a stable government after the next election.\n\nThe controversy started last month when the government acknowledged it had wiretapped an opposition leader’s phone — a move it called legal but wrong. It then quickly blossomed into a labyrinthine story that involved controversial spyware being planted on the phones of an ever-expanding network of politicians and journalists.\n\nBut the government has claimed no connection to — or even knowledge of — these broader cases. And after firing two top government officials, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis is now holding firm, insisting he must stay the course amid gathering economic storm clouds, a war raging nearby and increasingly bellicose rhetoric from rival Turkey.\n\n“I’m not going to be the overseer of political instability,” Mitsotakis said Saturday night at an annual trade fair in the northern city of Thessaloniki — Greece’s biggest annual political event. “I will lead the country safely to the end of the four-year term and then we will be measured.”\n\nThe public is split on whether they want to see Mitsotakis stick around until then, though. Two recent polls showed just over half of Greeks feel the prime minister should resign. And with elections set to be held sometime in the next nine months, Mitsotakis’ potential coalition partners are trying to pounce on the crisis.\n\nHanging over everything is the possibility that more espionage plots will emerge. Already, there has been a consistent drip of fresh allegations in the Greek press in recent weeks.\n\nStill, Mitsotakis has reason to be confident that he and his center-right New Democracy party may emerge relatively unscathed. Even though some party members are grumbling about the revelations, New Democracy itself has not suffered in the polls. And voters appear far more focused on the tempestuous economy than they are on espionage.\n\n“Mitsotakis pledged not to go to elections in autumn, after a good tourist season, but in spring, after a very difficult winter,” said Athanasios Diamantopoulos, a Greek political specialist at Panteion University. “By then, reports of the wiretapping will not have died down, but there will be so many economic troubles that this will be the main stake.”\n\nCracks from within\n\nThe lingering scandal has not been without consequences — far from it.\n\nTo start, there were the resignations, which included one of Mitsotakis’ top aides and his intelligence chief. Those came after the government conceded it had authorized a wiretap of Nikos Androulakis, a European Parliament member who leads the third-largest party in Greece’s parliament, the center-left Pasok.\n\nMaking matters worse, intrusive spyware known as Predator was also found on Androulakis’ phone, in addition to those of a journalist and a lawmaker from the main opposition party, the left-wing Syriza. The government has denied any links to those buggings.\n\nStill, there are lingering questions about what, exactly, occurred. Mitsotakis has refused to explain why his political opponent was spied on, pointing to national security concerns.\n\nThe silence has left some New Democracy members uneasy.\n\n“In such situations, catharsis occurs only when they are fully clarified,” Kostas Karamanlis, a former Greek prime minister and one-time head of New Democracy, said during a recent party event in Crete. “For these events to have been caused by government initiative is not only undemocratic and illegal but so far beyond the bounds of morbid imagination and political nonsense that it is unthinkable.”\n\nThe frustrations have spilled into parliament, where Nikitas Kaklamanis, a New Democracy member and deputy house speaker, said he now opposes a provision he and the ruling party passed depriving citizens of the ability to find out if they are under surveillance. Pasok also initially backed the legislation.\n\nNew Democracy parliament member Konstantinos Tzavaras even branded the Greek media a “disgrace” for not covering the scandal more.\n\n“The functioning of the constitution has taken a severe blow and the prime minister must rise to the occasion,” said Tzavaras, one of the party’s representatives in a parliamentary inquiry investigating the issue.\n\nWith elections set to be held sometime in the next nine months, t he public is split on whether they want to see Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis stick around | Aris Messinis/Eurokinissi/AFP via Getty Images\n\nDespite the public reprimands, a full revolt from within the party remains unlikely — the number of disaffected New Democracy figures has not increased in recent days.\n\nTo some political specialists in the country, Mitsotakis’ staying power is a symptom of a malfunctioning Greek political system.\n\n“If we were in any democratic state we would not have political instability,” said Nikos Marantzidis, a political science professor at the University of Macedonia. “The PM would have already resigned and succession developments would have been initiated.”\n\nMitsotakis, Marantzidis argued, “identifies his personal future with the future of democracy and the country when he says that if I resign there will be instability.”\n\nMitsotakis struck back at that thinking on Sunday, saying: “People know us. If not us, then who?”\n\nAn eye on elections\n\nUltimately, Mitsotakis is likely to spend the coming months both trying to keep his party together — and trying to navigate an ever-more complicated election, which must be held by next July and is expected to take place in the spring.\n\nUntil the spying revelations surfaced, New Democracy and Pasok were seen as heading toward forming a centrist coalition government after the upcoming elections.\n\nThat’s all over.\n\n“It is now very difficult for Pasok voters to move towards New Democracy, but even more difficult for them to put pressure on their party leadership to participate in a coalition,” said Diamantopoulos, the Greek political specialist at Panteion University.\n\nMitsotakis put the blame for that on Androulakis himself, accusing him of playing politics with his surveillance.\n\n“I believe that what happened helped Androulakis to walk a line that was predetermined, that of rupture with New Democracy,” he said, alleging that the Pasok leader is in “disharmony” with his own voters.\n\nGreece’s next national election will be held under a proportional representation system, making it almost impossible for any party to gather a majority. Because of that, the country will most likely head to a second election, which would be held under a system granting bonus seats to the first party. Current polling, however, shows no party close to reaching an absolute majority, even with a second-round bonus.\n\nBefore the spying scandal, that reality had fueled expectations that New Democracy and Pasok would be pressed into a coalition. Now, with the two parties squabbling, speculation is running rampant about what coalition formations could emerge from such a divisive moment.\n\nMitsotakis could link up with the nationalist, Russophile Greek Solution party. Yet that would represent a U-turn for the prime minister, who styles himself as a moderate and pro-U.S. politician.\n\nOn Sunday, Mitsotakis said that he doesn’t feel “at all close” to Greek Solution but didn’t exclude a potential tie-up, arguing he is “not ready to talk about what the options will be” if a coalition is needed. He also left open the option of teaming up with specific lawmakers from various political parties to bolster his standing.\n\nRemarkably, a team-up between New Democracy and Pasok is still on the table, according to political analysts in Athens — but realistically only without Mitsotakis as the prime minister. That’s not something Mitsotakis will likely go for.\n\n“The leader of the first party must be the prime minister, even in the case of a coalition government,” the prime minister underlined on Sunday.\n\nSimilarly, a grand coalition between New Democracy, Pasok and Syriza — an approach Pasok favors — would likely require new leadership within New Democracy.\n\n“This is possible, but won’t be simple,” said Marantzidis, the political science professor. “As long as [Mitsotakis] identifies his personal future with the future of democracy and the country, this will have a negative impact on developments after the elections.”\n\nMitsotakis himself warned against another possibility — a coalition that pulls together all the center-left and left-wing opposition parties to form a government omitting New Democracy, even if it finishes first.\n\n“This will be a political monstrosity and I have to inform and warn people about this possibility,” Mitsotakis said.\n\nPolls hold steady\n\nDespite the rapidly shifting political dynamics, polling last week showed limited damage to the government over the spy scandal.\n\nDepending on the poll, New Democracy has only slid between 0.2 and 1.7 percentage points since the scandal erupted. Meanwhile, opposition parties Syriza and Pasok merely gained between 0.5 and 1 percentage point.\n\n“We have been surprised by the short-term reactions in the past,” said Giorgos Arapoglou, the general manager of Pulse polling company. Arapoglou recalled that after a massive 2018 fire that saw 100 people perish, the government first gained in the polls before losing power in 2019.\n\nUltimately, Arapoglou said the economy is usually the biggest factor in elections. Recent polls back up his theory. In a Marc survey, 84 percent of Greeks said they were concerned about inflation and the looming energy crisis this winter. Only 16 percent expressed worries about the wiretapping discoveries.\n\nWhen just considering politics, though, the espionage story does seem to loom large. A recent GPO poll showed nearly 70 percent of Greeks thought the case was a “very” or “quite” important part of the current political scene. Well over half, 59 percent, also thought Mitsotakis bore some responsibility, while about the same amount said the case had diminished their trust in government.\n\nAnd notably, multiple polls show a slim majority wants Mitsotakis to step aside — a Public Issue poll had it at 54 percent, while a ProRata poll put it at 51 percent.\n\nSome political analysts believe it’s just a matter of time until the issue catches up with the prime minister.\n\n“Obviously the government strategy is to forget what is happening,” said Marantzidis. “But,” he added, “one way or the other, just as Nixon didn’t avoid the truth, Mitsotakis will not be able to avoid it either.”",
    "Greece’s opposition parties rail at Mitsotakis over ‘Greek Watergate’ inquiry": "The Mitsotakis government has admitted it acted wrongly and promised to investigate the case | Giorgos Kontarinis/Eurokinissi/AFP via Getty Images\n\nATHENS — Greece’s opposition parties are railing against the conservative government of Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis over the inquiry into a wiretapping scandal dubbed “Greek Watergate.”\n\nAt a parliamentary session on Thursday investigating the spy scandal, opposition parties stormed out in protest, after the ruling New Democracy party blocked any political figures from being called to testify, including those directly involved.\n\nThe scandal broke last month when the government’s Secretary-General Grigoris Dimitriadis (who is the prime minister’s nephew) and the head of the National Intelligence Service (EYP) lost their jobs, after it transpired that the phone of Nikos Androulakis, head of the center-left Pasok party, had been surveilled by EYP. A separate attempt was made to tap his phone around the same time with illegal software called Predator, but Athens strenuously denies that EYP had any connection with that.\n\nThe Mitsotakis government has admitted it acted wrongly and promised to investigate the case.\n\nThursday’s parliamentary committee hearing in Athens was convened to form a list of people that will be summoned to testify. But New Democracy, which holds the majority in the panel, blocked dozens of witnesses proposed by opposition parties, including Dimitriadis and Mitsotakis, who is in charge of the EYP.\n\n“Mitsotakis is trying to impose an omertà so that other aspects of his parallel state are not revealed,” main opposition party Syriza said in a statement.\n\nNew Democracy also blocked from the list of witnesses journalists whose phones have been wiretapped, or have investigated the issue, as well as state officials from police and the Greek secret service. In the end, fewer than 10 people will be summoned.\n\n“The one who advocated light has imposed darkness,” Pasok said in a statement. “Mitsotakis has staged a theatrical performance in order to hide himself and his nephew and to obscure his parallel state actions.”\n\nAccording to a report in the Greek newspaper Ta Nea, surveillance evidence in the cases of Androulakis and of journalist Thanasis Koukakis has been destroyed due to technical factors. Such files are usually stored by the spy services for two years.\n\n“The case is in the hands of justice and parliamentary institutions,” government spokesman Giannis Oikonomou said at a briefing on Thursday. “I don’t know if it has been destroyed or not. Those who are competent by law and implement the protocols in place know.”\n\nAt the European Parliament in Brussels, meanwhile, the assembly’s spyware inquiry committee, known as PEGA, on Thursday held an exchange of views on the use of spyware in Greece. The panel heard from, among others, three journalists involved in uncovering the scandal and who have themselves been surveilled.\n\nMEP Stelios Kouloglou from the Left group contrasted the investigation in Athens with the inquiry being carried out by the European Parliament.\n\n“The transparency and the search for the truth from the PEGA committee is in contrast to the violent cover up efforts of the relevant inquiry committee of the Greek Parliament,” Kouloglou said. “MEPs got a taste of the deep state that Mitsotakis has established. “\n\nBut government officials who testified in the PEGA committee on Thursday, refrained from shedding more light, referring to the Greek judicial authorities.\n\nMEP Sophie in ‘t Veld called the panel a “Computer-says-No” sketch. “Hardly any answers, cos ‘not within our power,’ ‘no comment on matters sub judice,’ ‘national security therefore top secret,’ she said in a tweet.\n\nThe Greek government refused to give a specific answer on whether there is a judicial investigation on the wiretapping scandal, rather than just on how the story was leaked to media. They said however that the Greek government stands ready to work with the European authorities to investigate the issue.",
    "Greece: Students' protests ongoing in central Athens as of late Sept. 17": "Event\n\nSeveral student organizations have gathered in central Athens as of late Sept. 17 to denounce the introduction of police patrols on university campuses. Police have reportedly employed tear gas and water cannons to disperse the demonstrators.\n\nIncreased security, as well as localized transport and business disruptions, are likely for the duration of the demonstrations in central Athens. Security forces will likely remain deployed. Riot police will almost certainly employ crowd control measures, particularly if the protesters refuse to heed their instructions.\n\nContext\n\nAdditional demonstrations in opposition to the deployment of police on campuses in Athens are almost certain. Major protests have occurred near Constitution Squares in Athens and Thessaloniki, Sept. 8. The demonstrations have primarily been organized by several student organizations, including the Students Struggle Front (MAS) and Communist Youth of Greece (KNE). The protests are in response to the New Democracy (ND) political party's deployment of University Institutions Protection Teams (OPPI), which allegedly aims to protect academic centers from anarchism and vandalism.\n\nAdvice\n\nAvoid all protests as a routine security precaution and to mitigate associated disruptions. Heed instructions from security services and leave the area at the first sign of a confrontation. Check for disruptions before beginning journeys and allow extra time for travel in the affected area.",

Greece relies on Russia for about 40 percent of its natural gas, so it has been hit particularly hard.\n\nInflation hit 12 percent this summer, its highest level in 29 years, according to data released by Eurostat, the official statistical authority of the European Union. And in a nation where the minimum wage is 713 euros per month, more than 43 percent of the labor force can’t afford to take a holiday, according to a survey by the European Trade Union Institute. Return ferry tickets to an island last year for a family of four, including a car, cost around 600 euros.\n\nThis year, it’s over 850 euros, according to the Greek Ministry of Shipping and Island Policy. The cheapest hotel on the Greek island of Mykonos this week costs at least 200 euros per night. That’s prohibitive even for most middle class Greeks. In total, a family holiday to a modest island destination would cost someone earning double the minimum wage a full month’s salary. And that’s before accounting for food, drinks, and restaurant costs.\n\nPort officials direct traffic from a ferry in Piraeus, Greece.\n\nGraffiti is seen in central Athens.\n\n\n\nYet Athenians’ biggest complaint of all is the rise in rent.\n\n“We in Greece had the big financial problems of 2010 to 2016. We recovered. Everything went well, and then came COVID, and then the war,” said Giorgios Stampoulos, an Athens cab driver for over 22 years. “Now, the tourists came back. We have a lot of tourists. … But the problem is we can’t afford an apartment because it’s all Airbnb for tourists, and if you find something, they want double or triple from last year.”\n\nBefore the pandemic, a modest two-bedroom apartment in central Athens would rent for roughly 300 euros a month. Now, the monthly price is at least 550 euros. Prices in large part have soared as tourists, expatriates, and digital nomads are making the most of the capital’s comparatively low rents and living costs. “If you have a Western European salary, Athens is a good base,” said 27-year-old Ben Biasi, a French tourist strolling through the pedestrian backstreets of Athens’s Plaka neighborhood.\n\nGiorigios Stampoulos waits for tourists arriving at Athens International Airport.\n\nTaxis and buses wait outside Athens International Airport.\n\n“Let’s go to an island, buy a house, and work from the house!” he said to his group of friends.\n\nCompanies like Airbnb and Booking.com have been catering to not only tourists but those seeking longer-term stays. One such company is Blueground, which has more than 1,000 fully furnished apartments in Athens, rented out to mostly U.S. citizens for around 1,200 euros per month.\n\n“Business is a booming! It’s good,” said Demetri Geras, 27, from Blueground. “They come for the sun. It’s the Florida of Europe.”\n\nA family holiday to a modest island destination would cost someone earning double the minimum wage a full month’s salary.\n\nAs a Greek-American with family here, however, Geras recognizes the hardships that Greeks are facing. “Most of the youth here are living with their parents. They make less than 1,000 euros a month, so they can’t move out.” Although he works in property, Geras sees the problem as a lack of fair employment opportunity and remuneration from employers.\n\n“We can point fingers at people in real estate, but it’s almost criminal how much [Greeks] get paid,” he said. “They are almost starving. … Wages are not so great due to austerity measures and low Greek minimum wage. Food and rent have gone up. Homeowners have raised their Airbnb prices for foreigners who are coming to Athens. And Greeks are the ones paying the price.”\n\nA street vendor sits in central Athens.\n\nOne of those people paying the price is street artist and graphic designer Kostas Sergiou, 36. “I’m struggling,” he said. “In March, I had a health problem, a panic attack. … The cause was stress.” Sergiou’s landlady put up his rent, and now, he’s struggling to find the money to pay his bills.\n\nSummer holidays are sacred to Greeks, and most Athenians tend to flee the city heat for vacations on the coast or mountains. Sergiou is staying put. “I prefer to stay here because I feel less stressed. … For us Greeks, it’s cheaper to go on a trip outside Greece than to an island.”\n\nTourists pose for a selfie in Monastiraki Square in Athens.\n\nTourists walk through the Monastiraki Flea Market in Athens.\n\n\n\nDespite the economic hardships, Greeks are still finding ways to have a break. Drive along the coast from Athens to the ancient Temple of Poseidon, known as Sounio, this summer, and you will find lines of parked cars dotted around rocky swimming holes. The so-called Athenian Riviera is packed.\n\nAs city residents seek swims closer to home, Greeks also continue to have a relatively high level of property ownership within their families, and many Greeks are choosing to take breaks at their family homes or with friends who own property. Others are finding cheaper alternatives like “free camping,” playing a cat-and-mouse game with authorities as they erect tents along the coast before being told to move on or saturating areas where it is tolerated, such as the far-flung Greek island of Tilos, which has seen a spike in campers this year.\n\nOthers, still, are going abroad to European destinations like Berlin, Sergiou said, as Greece becomes unaffordable.\n\nBut amid it all, a trace of traditional Greek attitudes remains. “Open your Instagram, and you see everyone splashing about. … Summer is summer,” Sergiou said. “Greek people will go wherever they can and face their problems in September.”",
    "Is Greece failing to deploy EU-funded surveillance system at Turkish border as intended?": "On August 15, 2022, a group of 38 Syrian and Palestinian men, women and children were picked up by Greek authorities in the Evros region on the Greek-Turkish border and taken to a nearby refugee center for processing. Their rescue marked the end of an internationally-reported, weekslong ordeal during which the asylum-seekers said they had been stranded on a small, unnamed islet in the Evros River — the natural border between Greece and Turkey.\n\nThe islet, which is located near the Greek village of Kissari, is in a restricted military zone that is inaccessible to civilians. While stranded, some of the asylum-seekers were in contact with civil society groups and journalists, sending their GPS coordinates and pleas for help.\n\nFor weeks, those attempting to help from afar provided the Greek police with GPS coordinates, which were confirmed by live locations and metadata in photos and other material the asylum-seekers had sent. Greek authoritiesreleased media statements saying that they had made \"successive investigations, with every suitable technical means,\" but had been unable to locate the group.\n\nGreek and international media outlets reported that a young Syrian girl traveling with the group died while awaiting rescue. Officials from the center-right administration of Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis have questioned the story of the young girl's death and maintained that Greece responded to the incident in accordance with EU and international law.\n\nCould the asylum-seekers have been rescued sooner?\n\nLess than two kilometers (about a mile) away from the group's shared location, on a hill overlooking sunflower and wheat fields and the road that runs parallel to the islet, stands a surveillance pylon equipped with radar, heat sensors and cameras. This tech-laden pylon is believed to be part of the newly-expanded surveillance system that Greek police could have used to locate the asylum-seekers on the islet.\n\nIn recent years, Greece has poured millions into high-tech systems — including drones, sensors and cameras — aimed at tracking down and deterring migrants attempting to enter the country irregularly. Although parts of the Automated Border Surveillance System (ABSS) have existed for years, Greek authorities, with funding from the EU, recently undertook a €15 million project (just under $15 million) to expand the system in the Evros border region.\n\nAn investigation by DW, in cooperation with independent researchers who exclusively shared material and findings with DW, strongly suggests that a prompt rescue of the group could have been possible with Greece's newly-expanded state-of-the-art surveillance system. This would contradict police statements on this and similar search-and-rescue missions in the region.\n\nDid Greek authorities know where the asylum-seekers were?\n\n\"It's absurd that the Greek police and government in this incident, and similar ones earlier this year, say that they cannot locate people on islets. They have the technology, and the area is heavily patrolled by both police and army,\" said Lena Karamanidou, an Evros native with an in-depth knowledge of the region and an expert in asylum policies, who spent months mapping the previously undisclosed locations of the pylons that make up the ABSS.\n\nKaramanidou — formerly affiliated with Glasgow Caledonian University in Scotland and currently an independent researcher — has contributed to several major journalistic investigations and reports on alleged human rights abuses in Evros.\n\nMigrants protesting near the Greek parliament against alleged pushbacks and border violence. Greece has repeatedly and strongly denied that its forces are involved in pushbacks\n\nAs part of the mapping effort, Karamanidou reviewed historical satellite imagery together with Phevos Simeonidis, an independent researcher whose work often features in media reports, and Laszlo Kovacs, who works with border monitor groups on a voluntary basis. Karamanidou verified the existence of the pylons during field research in the region, using images of pylons publicized in the Greek media as a reference.\n\nSurveillance pylons close to the islet where asylum-seekers were stranded\n\nDW confirmed the location of several pylons when reporting from the region in April and July of this year. DW also analyzed historical satellite imagery, reviewed dozens of Greek and EU records — some obtained through public records requests — and conducted on-the-ground field work over several months in Evros as part of the investigation.\n\nA measurement — which factors-in elevation levels — of the distance between one of the identified pylons and the islet in question, paired with an analysis of publicly-available technical specifications contained in police documents, suggests that the system should have been able to detect the refugees and ensure their prompt rescue.\n\nThe islet on the River Evros on the Greek-Turkish border where a group of 38 asylum-seekers said they were stranded is located in a restricted military zone\n\nDW contacted Space Hellas S.A., the Greek private company contracted to expand the ABSS, to ask whether the system delivered to Greek police matches technical descriptions in police documents and in Greek media reports. The company declined to comment, citing confidentiality.\n\nThe total 'sealing of the Evros border'\n\nCovering what they described as the ABSS's completion with much fanfare last fall, Greek media noted that it marked the total \"sealing of the Evros border.\" The all-seeing system, they proclaimed, can even spot activity several kilometers into Turkish territory, a capability also described in technical police documents.\n\nThe Greek Police were repeatedly contacted by DW and invited to comment on the findings of the investigation over the course of more than two weeks. A police spokesperson pointed DW to press releases, which did not specifically address the questions asked.\n\nRound-the-clock surveillance\n\nThe revamped system, according to Greek police documents, gives Greek authorities the ability to stay \"informed in real time\" and \"with great accuracy\" on the \"conditions in the field for the entire length of our country's river border with Turkey.\"\n\nGreece has built a steel wall along the Evros river, the natural border between Turkey and Greece, to prevent migrants from entering the country irregularly\n\nData from the pylons, including video streams and radar tracks, are fed to local and regional monitoring centers, which are staffed to survey the footage round the clock. Information is ultimately fed to the National Coordination Center in Athens that is part of the European Border Surveillance Network (EUROSUR), an EU project aimed at facilitating information-sharing between border management authorities and Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency.\n\nThe stated aim of the surveillance infrastructure of which the ABSS is a part, which is laid out in formal documents, is to \"prevent and combat illegal crossings\" into Greece and to ensure \"the protection and saving of migrants' lives.\"\n\nMinister claims no surveillance data on the stranded asylum-seekers\n\nDuring an August 30 meeting in parliament, Civil Protection Minister Takis Theodorikakos appeared to suggest that the ABSS had been used in the search-and-rescue operation but said that there was \"no data on the electronic surveillance system that people were [on the islet].\" He provided no further details, and his office did not respond to emails seeking clarification.\n\nCivil Protection Minister Takis Theodorikakos (archive photo) has said that the ABSS was successfully deployed in efforts to stop 36,000 people from entering Greece through the Evros border in August alone\n\nAt the same time, Theodorikakos said, the system had been successfully deployed in multi-pronged deterrence efforts to stop 36,000 people from entering Greece through the Evros border in August alone.\n\nMinistry says Greece fulfilled its humanitarian duty quickly\n\nThe Greek Ministry of Migration and Asylum directed DW's queries on the ABSS to the Greek police. \"It is evident that our country quickly fulfilled its humanitarian duty, offering health care and the possibility of submitting an asylum request to the group of 38 migrants as soon as they entered Greek territory,\" the migration ministry wrote to DW in an e-mail through the government's foreign media office.\n\nFrontex has no access to the ABSS\n\nWhen asked about the search-and-rescue mission and the ABSS system, Frontex wrote in an e-mail to DW: \"We offered our support to Greek authorities but were assured that they had the situation under control.\" Frontex has been rocked by a series of media investigations alleging that the agency was aware of illegal pushbacks by Greek authorities and was even able to monitor some of incidents from its own surveillance systems. Greece has strongly denied allegations that its forces are involved in pushbacks.\n\nLena Karamanidou says that the Greek authorities have the technology to locate people on islets in the River Evros\n\n\"The Automated Border Surveillance System in Evros is operated by Hellenic Police and Frontex has no direct access to it,\" a Frontex spokesperson wrote, adding that the agency would only be deployed to assist authorities based on observations made by the national coordination center in Athens, rather than the local and regional centers in the Evros region.\n\nEU Commission regrets loss of life\n\nDW contacted the European Commission regarding the findings of this investigation.\n\n\"The EU Commission regrets any loss of lives and we recall the fundamental importance of ensuring all measures are taken to prevent such tragedies, as on the Evros river islet,\" an EU Commission Spokesperson for HOME Affairs wrote in response to a request for comment on DW's findings that the ABSS could have been used for a prompt rescue. \"We welcome the efforts carried out by Greek authorities locating 38 people and providing aid while transferring them to a temporary accommodation. We have been in contact with the Greek authorities to stress the importance of taking the necessary measures to find appropriate solutions in the case at stake.\"\n\nMember States must ensure principles are respected\n\n75% of the expansion of the ABSS was financed through the EU's internal security fund.\n\nGreek Minister for Migration and Asylum Notis Mitarachi has accused Turkey of violently forcing asylum-seekers to cross the Greek border and has said Greece will further step up security in the Evros region in response\n\nThe EU spokesperson said that any activity financed by the EU budget must be implemented in full compliance with international law and the EU charter of fundamental rights. \"In cases of identified non-compliance, the EU Commission can reject requests for cost reimbursement declared in relation to the respective activity,\" the spokesperson wrote, adding that it is up to Member States to ensure that principles are respected and to carry out investigations following allegations of non-compliance.\n\nSurveillance in the Evros region\n\n\"The Evros region is one of the most high-risk, unregulated testing grounds for new border technologies. Ranging from sound cannons to aerial surveillance to high-tech fencing, these technologies are sharpening the already violent Greece-Turkey border,\" said Petra Molnar, associate director of the Refugee Law Lab at York University who studies the impact of border technologies on people on the move.\n\nStepping up surveillance and security in the Evros region has risen as a priority for Greece and the EU since the events of March 2020, when thousands of people, many at the encouragement of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, came to the Evros border and attempted to enter Greece to seek asylum.\n\nDuring a visit to Evros in 2020, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen (right, pictured here with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis in 2021) thanked Greece for being \"our European shield\"\n\nGreece accused its neighbor of orchestrating the ordeal to put pressure on the EU. During a visit to Evros at the time, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen thanked Greece for being \"our European shield.\"\n\nPrecarious situation for asylum-seekers\n\nThe case comes at a time of heightened tension between Greece and Turkey and a time when human rights groups and journalists are reporting an increasingly precarious situation for asylum-seekers and refugees in Turkey.\n\nGreece and Turkey accuse each other of political foul play at the expense of asylum-seekers. Human rights organizations and international media have been reporting on systematic pushbacks for years and the fact that asylum-seekers are deprived of their right to apply for asylum in Europe after irregularly crossing the Greek-Turkish border. Greek authorities accuse the Turkish side of violently pushing asylum-seekers towards Greece. The group of asylum-seekers recently stranded on the Evros islet also alleges that it was pushed back and forth between the countries several times.\n\nGreece is obligated to help\n\nThe Greek authorities, after claiming that they were not able to locate the group, later announced that the asylum-seekers were on Turkish territory, and that the corresponding authorities had been informed. While the group was stranded in July, lawyers petitioned the European Court of Human Rights, which issued temporary measures ordering Greek authorities to rescue the people and give them access to the asylum procedure. Greek authorities failed to comply, despite appeals from Greek and international civil society groups.\n\n\"In Evros, a new wave of invasion is already being planned, under a supposedly humanitarian mask,\" Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said during a parliamentary debate in August\n\n\"If the state is aware of a risk to an individual and it can reasonably act to prevent the risk, then it is obligated to do so,\" said Omer Shatz, a lecturer in international law at Science Po Paris and legal director of the NGO Front-LEX. \"Even if the group was on Turkish territory but the Greek authorities watched their situation through cameras [and other technology], they were obliged to take the necessary measures to save the child's life and secure the safety of others.\"\n\nAsylum-seekers claim illegal pushbacks\n\nSince March, the European Court of Human Rights has issued at least 17 interim measures ordering Greek authorities to rescue people in distress in Evros. Greek police have complied with fewer than half. In some of these cases, asylum-seekers allege that they were illegally pushed back to Turkey.\n\nIn recent days, the rescue of the group has unleashed a fresh wave of familiar rhetoric from Greek government officials, who blame Turkey for forcing asylum-seekers onto Greece's doorstep in order to antagonize the country and the European Union.\n\nAthens suggests Turkey behind wave of asylum-seekers\n\n\"In Evros, a new wave of invasion is already being planned, under a supposedly humanitarian mask,\" Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said during a parliamentary debate in August.\n\nAppearing on Greek TV, Greek Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi said Turkey is violently forcing asylum-seekers to the Greek border in the expectation that civil society organizations, journalists and the European Court of Human Rights will intervene to compel Greece to rescue people. This, Mitarachi said, was a new tactic with which Turkey was weaponizing asylum-seekers to create a \"backdoor\" into Europe, and test Greece's improved deterrence capacities.\n\nIn response, Mitarachi said, Greece would further step up security in the Evros region by expanding a border fence and upgrading surveillance systems, including drones, cameras and other equipment in the area.\n\nThis investigation was made possible with the help of funding from the Pulitzer Center.\n\nCorrection, September 10, 2022: A previous version of this article incorrectly identified the Pulitzer Center.
