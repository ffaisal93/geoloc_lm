    "Working in Austria: Further Facilitation of the Red-White-Red Card": "Workers from non-EU countries will in future also be able to apply for a red-white-red card from within Austria. / Picture: © Vindobona.org\n\nGood news for people without Austrian citizenship who want to work here. The Red-White-Red Card, the Austrian work permit, which is sometimes difficult to apply for, will be easier to obtain in the future.\n\nQualified workers from non-EU countries who want to work in Austria will in future also be able to apply for a Red-White-Red Card from within Austria. This was decided by the National Council on the basis of a bill proposed by the coalition parties in its first session of the new 2022/23 session.\n\nUntil now, the Red-White-Red Card was issued for 24 months at a time and was subject to strict rules. It was issued exclusively for professions in which there was an acute shortage in Austria, where particularly highly qualified workers were needed, key workers, graduates of Austrian universities or start-up founders.\n\nThe application for the card had to be made before entering Austria.\n\nThe new proposals for the work permit provide that persons already residing in Austria can also apply for the Red-White-Red Card. The prerequisite for applying in Austria is that the applicants have entered Austria legally and that their stay in the federal territory is still legal. This includes people with and without a visa equally.\n\nThis means that in future, for example, skilled workers in shortage occupations or regular seasonal migrants will also be able to apply for a longer-term residence title on the spot, as the ÖVP and the Greens explained in the debate.\n\nThe amendment was also approved by the SPÖ and NEOS, although the two opposition parties see a need for further reform of the Red-White-Red Card, for example with regard to apprentices and asylum seekers.\n\nThe facilitated access became urgently necessary due to the acute shortage of skilled workers in Austria. In some sectors, the shortage has reached unprecedented heights and the economy is crying out for workers. Many of the skilled workers needed come from abroad. The Red-White-Red Card, which is difficult to apply for and administratively complex, discouraged both companies and workers from third countries from taking jobs in Austria.\n\nIn July of this year, a first reform of the Red-White-Red Card was passed, which should facilitate access to the Austrian labour market. For example, minimum requirements were lowered, such as the required language skills or the salary. Vindobona reported.\n\nAustrian Parliament",

    "How Sigmund Freud fled Nazi Austria, leaving siblings who perished in the Holocaust": "On March 15, 1938, three days after German troops crossed into Austria, approximately 250,000 people greeted Adolf Hitler when he appeared on the balcony of the Hofburg, Vienna’s imperial palace, to announce the political union of Austria with Nazi Germany through annexation.\n\nThe Anschluss launched mass arrests in Vienna and triggered a wave of anti-Semitic violence too. Jews were beaten and killed, their stores looted, and dozens committed suicide. As the German takeover of Austria began, Sigmund Freud was ensconced in his longtime residence and office at Berggasse 19 in Vienna’s 9th district. “Finis Austriae [the end of Austria],” the neurologist and founder of psychoanalysis observed in his diary at the time.\n\n“As a Jew, [Freud] was automatically in danger as the undisputed public face of what most Nazi officials denounced as [his] Jewish pseudoscience,” Andrew Nagorski writes in his new book “Saving Freud,” published on August 23.\n\nNagorski explores Freud’s escape from Nazi Vienna to the safety of London, which began with a train to Paris on June 4, 1938. The journey was by no means easy, however, and took a concerted effort from what Nagorski calls “an ad hoc rescue squad.” This loyal group of Freudian followers included people such as Ernest Jones, William Bullitt, Marie Bonaparte and Freud’s daughter, Anna Freud.\n\n“These were a mix of colorful personalities of divergent backgrounds and nationalities, but they all shared a common interest: a devotion to Freud and his theories,” Nagorski writes in the book’s opening chapter. “They also wanted Freud to overcome his reluctance to leave Vienna.”\n\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms\n\nNagorski has spent more than three decades as an award-winning Newsweek foreign correspondent and editor in Germany, Russia, Poland, Italy and Hong Kong. From 2008 to April 2014, Nagorski was vice president and director of the international affairs think tank EastWest Institute.\n\nThe Scottish-born American journalist’s other books include “1941: The Year Germany Lost the War,” “The Nazi Hunters” and “Hitlerland: American Eyewitnesses to the Nazi Rise to Power.”\n\nThe Times of Israel caught up with Nagorski via Zoom from his home in St. Augustine, Florida. The conversation has been edited for clarity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Times of Israel: Sigmund Freud coined the term “psychoanalysis” in 1896. Can you speak about how the scientific and cultural movement grew in Vienna during the early 20th century?\n\nAndrew Nagorski: It began with the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society. This was a small group that gathered every Wednesday evening at Freud’s residence in Vienna’s 9th district. Freud wanted to spread those ideas way beyond Vienna and Budapest, where most of the early followers were from.\n\nAlso, this early group of psychoanalysts were mostly Jewish. Freud did not want psychoanalysis to be perceived as a Jewish science. Moreover, he was conscious enough of antisemitism to know that if that happened, it would be to the detriment of psychoanalysis. He was therefore delighted when the Swiss psychologist Carl Jung, who was a gentile, expressed a fervent interest to become a follower of [psychoanalysis]. But they later had a falling out.\n\nIn the book you explore how the Nazis stole some of Freud’s ideas, which seems rather odd given the fact that they publicly burned his books in Berlin in 1933.\n\nIndeed, the Nazis publicly denounced Freud’s work and psychoanalysis. But in 1936, Matthias Göring — the cousin of Hitler’s righthand man, Hermann Göring — launched the German Institute for Psychological Research and Psychotherapy in Berlin. This was based on the premise that the Nazis would create their own form of psychotherapy. The idea was that it would be purged from Jewish ideas and Jewish analysts. But in doing this, the Nazis were clearly building upon fundamental ideas that had been pioneered by Freud and his followers, even though they claimed it had nothing to do with Freud or the early versions of psychoanalysis.\n\nCan you talk about Freud’s relationship with Zionism?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was complicated. He was a board member of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Freud was not opposed to the notion of a Jewish state. He talked about being sympathetic to the Zionist impulse. But he also spoke about what he saw as the practical problems of a homeland for the Jews in what was then Mandatory Palestine.\n\nThis was expressed in a very famous letter which was buried for a long time in Israel.\n\nIn that letter, Freud said he did not see how Muslims and Christians would tolerate Jewish control of the Holy Land if the Zionist project were realized. He argued that it would be better to have a Jewish homeland somewhere else. But he also understood that, for historical and cultural reasons, which were fundamental to the idea of a Jewish state, this would never be acceptable to Jews. Freud therefore had contradictory impulses on this topic. He identified as a cultural Jew and was proud of his Jewish heritage. But he was an atheist with no connection to religious belief himself, even though he was fascinated by religion as a cultural subject.\n\nIn the book you discuss Freud’s sex life, although there isn’t a great deal of gossip or scandal to speak about. What does this tell us about Freud’s work and biographical story?\n\nFreud once said, “I’m all for greater sexual freedom, but I don’t make use of that sexual freedom myself.” He was a straitlaced guy. He married Martha, his wife, [at age 30] and he was a dedicated family man from this point on. Freud could talk with his patients, most of whom were very sexually active, about everything without inhibitions and judgment. But in his own life, he was very [sexually] cautious and conservative. I would even go so far as to say that he was awkward and shy around women.\n\nErnest Jones, Freud’s official biographer, is a key figure in your book. What role did Jones play in promoting Freud’s work in the Anglophile world?\n\nErnest Jones was a Welsh doctor who began reading Freud’s work in German as a young man. Jones was then introduced to Freud via Carl Jung. Jones brought Freud’s work into the English-speaking world. Previously, it was available only in German. Later, Jones became president of the International Psychoanalytical Society. Jones and Freud developed a real rapport. Jones really helped to make Freud a global figure. His three-volume biography on Freud is still the first place one should look when investigating Freud’s life.\n\nYou also explore the relationship between Anna Freud and her father. It was quite intense!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnna was the youngest of the Freuds’ six children. Freud became her analyst. He advised against this later. Then as Freud got older, Anna took care of his daily needs, in his apartment in Berggasse 19 in Vienna, and then later at Freud’s house in Hampstead, London, where he died in September 1939. Anna also played an important role in the rescue operation for the Freud family. She negotiated with the Nazis, which helped overcome the bureaucratic obstacles standing in the way of them emigrating to England.\n\nUnder what conditions did Freud eventually escape Nazi Vienna? Was it simply a question of money? Or did his social and professional connections help with the evacuation?\n\nMoney, of course, came into the equation. But it wasn’t just a question of money. When the Anschluss happened, the Nazis appointed so-called trustees for prominent Jewish families [in Austria] — particularly rich Jewish families. Freud was part of this wealthy group, although he was by no means the richest. The Nazis created what they called a flight tax. This saw them assess the individual wealth of some of Vienna’s richest Jews. In Freud’s case, they calculated that he had a net worth [in assets] of about $50,000. This included his apartment and the International Psychoanalytic Publishing House. In today’s money that amounts to about a million dollars. The Nazis then ordered Freud to pay roughly 25 percent of this sum.\n\nDid Freud pay the Nazis and where did he get the money?\n\nA wealthy woman, Marie Bonaparte, who was the wife of Prince George of Greece and Denmark, and also the great-grandniece of Napoleon. She provided most of it in cash.\n\nIn 1938 there was not a lot of countries eager to accept Jewish refugees from the Third Reich. How did Freud manage to be accepted into England?\n\nErnest Jones played an important role. He pulled every string he could in London to make sure the Freuds got entry permits into England. Jones was very resourceful and had a lot of connections in high places. But until the Freuds got on the train in Vienna, on June 4, 1938, bound for Paris, it wasn’t clear if he and his family were going to get out of the country safely. Four of Freud’s sisters who remained behind later perished in the death camps during the Holocaust.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWas Freud in close contact with his four sisters?\n\nYes. In fact, he left them a good deal of money in the hope that they could survive. Freud was very worried about his sisters left in Austria. And when he got out, he asked Marie Bonaparte, who was working to get other Jews out of Austria and Germany, whether she could try again to get his sisters out. But it was not possible.\n\nFreud lived much of his life under the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which collapsed in 1918. Did his memories of its liberal and tolerant political culture influence the misguided belief he held, through the 1930s, that Austria would not be taken over by the Nazis?\n\nIt definitely played a part. Freud always held this hope that the Austrian politicians would be able to keep the Nazis and Hitler at bay. He felt the antisemitism in Vienna, which he often complained about, would remain, albeit on a modest scale. But, of course, after the Anschluss that proved to be a major miscalculation. It’s important to remember too, that Freud had no desire to disrupt his life and to become an émigré, especially as he was coming towards the end of his life.\n\nThe Austrian novelist Stefan Zweig appears several times in this book. You seem to have a keen interest in his work.\n\nI got the idea for writing this book when I was reading Stefan Zweig’s autobiography, “The World of Yesterday.” Zweig left Vienna in 1934 and died in Petrópolis, Brazil, in February 1942.\n\nZweig felt it was getting way too dangerous for [Jews] in the Austrian capital. Freud, meanwhile, stayed behind. Zweig later reconnected with Freud in London in 1938. Reading Zweig’s biographical story got me thinking about a question that really drove me to write this book: Why were so many Jews leaving Vienna at this time, and why was Freud so determined to stay?\n\nWere Zweig and Freud close friends?\n\nNo. But Zweig and Freud had a tremendous amount of respect for one another. They got to know each other fairly well in Vienna, and again in London. Freud appreciated Zweig as a writer, and Zweig appreciated Freud as the thinker of his age. Freud, after all, came from relative obscurity in his younger days to become probably one of the most celebrated intellectuals of the [early 20th] century.\n\nFreud achieved celebrity status when he arrived in London in 1938. By that stage he was already a world-famous intellectual. Why were the British so in awe of him?\n\nIn Austria, Freud developed this fame gradually. He was a well-known figure in the cafes and streets of Vienna. But in London, he was treated as a huge celebrity and his arrival was seen as a major event which got huge coverage in the British press. A lot of Brits were very proud that he had chosen to end up there. And he was bombarded with letters and invitations by numerous universities and cultural institutions. Many other famous figures in Britain at the time came to see Freud at his home in North London, including H.G. Wells, Virginia Woolf and Salvador Dali.\n\nWhile researching this book did you consider what might have happened to the Freud family had they stayed in Vienna after 1938?\n\nYes, it’s something I have thought about. Freud probably still would have died before the Holocaust began, as his life ended in London in September 1939. But I would guess that had he in stayed in Vienna after 1938, he and his family would have been increasingly terrorized by the Nazis and that his wife, Martha, and daughter, Anna, would have been killed in the Holocaust.",
    "Rast got \"punished\" for conservative strategy in Austria DTM race": "After a strong second-place result in the opening race of the weekend behind Red Bull’s Nick Cassidy, Rast was again on course to finish as the highest-placed championship contender in Sunday’s second contest as he ran fifth after his pitstop.\n\nBut the track started to dry out rapidly in the closing stages of the race, putting the wet-shod Abt Audi of Rast on the back foot. As drivers who had gambled on slick tyres started charging through the field, Rast had no pace to hold his position and slipped to 11th in less than a handful of laps.\n\nReigning champion Maximilian Gotz was later handed a 30-second time penalty for a pitstop infringement, promoting Rast up a place in the final order, but the German driver was left with only a solitary point to show for his efforts.\n\nWith championship leader Sheldon van der Linde drawing a blank on a torrid weekend for BMW, the race is seen as a lost opportunity for Rast to bridge the gap to the South African and boost his chances of a fourth DTM title with Audi.\n\nSpeaking after the race, Rast explained that he had to take the championship picture into account while choosing his strategy, and the rain tyres had appeared to be the safe bet when he stopped on lap 21 of 35.\n\n\"When you fight for the championship, you always try to keep an eye on the opponents and not take exorbitant risks. You do what the competition is doing,\" the 35-year-old told Motorsport.com’s sister title Motorsport-Total.com.\n\n“Things looked good for a long time and we were fifth. Only then was the track suddenly so dry that the cars with slicks came from behind and then really overtook me in the last corner, which knocked me out of the points [until Gotz’s penalty].\n\n“Today we played it safe and unfortunately we were punished for it in the end.”\n\nThe second race at the Red Bull Ring saw a wide range of strategies as the action began in wet conditions before the track started drying out, with a late drizzle on the final lap complicating matters even further.\n\nHRT driver Luca Stolz finished second after making an early pitstop on lap 7 for wets to run in clear air, while polesitter Maro Engel switched to slicks late on to snatch the final spot on the podium.\n\nRast, however, felt both strategies had their own risks and the best possible option for him was to extend his first stint and then take on a fresh set of wet tyres.\n\n\"If you had stopped early, there was a risk that it would really dry out and then you would have had to switch to slicks again,” he explained.\n\n“We didn't want to take that risk. That's why we drove a little longer and of course observed all the competition and what the others were doing. Then we drove on and were virtually overtaken by many who stopped early.\n\n\"We might have done two or three laps longer and then switch to slicks. But it was so difficult because there was no dry track before the pit stop window [was closed].\"\n\nAuer wouldn’t have “dared” to switch to slicks\n\nWinward Mercedes driver Lucas Auer was one of the first drivers to gamble on slick tyres after coming into the pits just two laps after Rast’s stop, having been told by his race engineer over team radio that \"we'll only score points with slicks today.”\n\nLucas Auer, Mercedes-AMG Team WINWARD Mercedes-AMG GT3 Photo by: Alexander Trienitz\n\nAlthough Auer fell as low as 21st after struggling on a track that was still wet at most places, the complexion of his race soon took a turn for the better and he climbed up to sixth at the finish.\n\nThe eight points he scored elevated him to second in the championship, one point clear of Rast and only 11 adrift of Schubert BMW’s van der Linde ahead of the title decider at Hockenheim.\n\nAuer said he wouldn’t have switched to slick tyres if he was making the call, but it soon became clear to him that the team had put him on the right strategy.\n\n\"That was the perfect decision,” the Austrian told Motorsport-Total.com. \"I wouldn't have dared to do that. But that was the only chance we had to pull something off today.\n\n\"I almost flew off at least three times on the first lap after the pit stop. But when the tyres then reached operating temperature, I knew: we did the right thing.\n\n\"Fourth place on Saturday was like a victory for us with the speed we had. Only Sunday in the rain I didn't deliver in qualifying. That was shit, I have to say. Also from me - just not enough.\n\n“That's why I'm happy with the race now.\"\n\nThe top five drivers are separated by just 16 points going into Hockenheim, with van der Linde sitting at the top on 130 points, Auer second on 119, Rast third on 118, Thomas Preining fourth with 116 and Mirko Bortolotti fifth with 114 points on board.",

    "Austria to release additional diesel from strategic reserve": "The government plans to release 60,000 tonnes of diesel from Austria’s strategic energy reserves to shore up market supply amid continued issues at the country’s only refinery: OMV Schwechat.\n\nIn July, the Schwechat refinery, crucial to the region, suffered a serious malfunction followed by uncertainty on when it would be back in action, prompting multiple releases of strategic energy stocks. With activities slated to be restarted in early October, Vienna hopes to shore up supplies one last time.\n\n“In this way, we want to ensure that there is enough fuel available for Austria despite the delay in restarting Schwechat,” Leonore Gewessler, minister of climate protection, said.\n\nFollowing discussions with OMV, the owner of the refinery, and Austria’s fossil oil businesses, the ministry for climate protection will push for the strategic release; a spokesperson told APA on Sunday.\n\nThus far, the Austrian government has released 212,000 tonnes of diesel, 56,000 tonnes of petrol and 45,000 tonnes of semi-finished products.\n\n“We are doing this [release] carefully and deliberately because the oil reserve is there for an absolute emergency. We must not waste it carelessly,” the minister highlighted.\n\nOne last hurdle remains: a two-thirds majority is required to release strategic energy stocks. Thus, the social democrat SPÖ or the far-right FPÖ must back the government’s proposal. Yet, either will likely want to be seen “obstructing” access to diesel.\n\n(Nikolaus J.

    "Why Haas say Schumacher's Austria attitude 'wasn't great'": "Despite scoring his best ever F1 finish with sixth place in the Austrian Grand Prix, Mick Schumacher’s attitude 'wasn’t great' during the previous day's Sprint event at Spielberg. That's the view of Haas' Chief Race Engineer Ayao Komatsu, who says the German was dissatisfied with how the team had handled their strategy. During Saturday's Sprint event, Schumacher was behind teammate Kevin Magnussen and requested to be let through. But no team orders were forthcoming, with Schumacher staying behind Magnussen as he defended against Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton. With Hamilton eventually making his way past, Schumacher ended the Sprint in ninth while Magnussen took seventh, prompting the German to take issue with how events had been allowed to unfold. \"Mick was behind Kevin and that frustrated him,\" Komatsu told German outlet Motorsport-Total. \"His focus in the Sprint race wasn't the right one. We talked about that afterwards. We talked before the Sprint race about how we would do it as a team. But what he did after that wasn't great, and what he said after that wasn't great either.\"\n\nSchumacher 'focusing too much' on Magnussen Komatsu added that Schumacher had a tendency to focus too much on his teammate at the expense of concentrating on his own race, adding that the German sometimes needed a proverbial arm round the shoulder. \"Sometimes Mick focuses too much on his team-mate,\" said Komatsu. \"Then I say to him 'look, Kevin really likes to help you and he tells you things he would never have told [former Haas driver] Romain [Grosjean] before'. \"Then Mick thinks and realises the most important thing for the team is to get up in the Constructors’ Championship. \"I explain it to him: 'Mick, come on, you're doing well, focus on your own performance and not on this thing'. And then it's fine again.\"\n\n\n\n© Haas\n\nSchumacher benefitting from Magnussen experience Schumacher's debut F1 season in 2021 saw the German partner fellow rookie Nikita Mazepin, but the Russian was dropped on the eve of the 2022 season after his country's invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent sanctioning of Russian entities and individuals – including Mazepin himself and his father Dmitry. In Mazepin's stead came Magnussen, who had previously driven for Haas from 2017 to 2020 in addition to previous stints with McLaren and Renault, and Komatsu said Schumacher was benefiting from having a more experienced teammate to learn from. \"It's very good for Mick to have an established team-mate like Kevin,\" said Komatsu. \"We didn't know beforehand how good he was. Then Kevin came along and that gave us a reference. We think that with our 2021 car we would have been safe against Williams – we could have fought if we'd had Kevin back then. Mick would have benefited from that in his development.\"",

He told Kicker after the game: “We’re still struggling a bit on the wing-back positions.”\n\nRangnick had a tough job, to avoid last place in a group with France, Denmark and Croatia, so there was something inevitable about this eventual relegation.\n\nThe campaign began with a 3-0 win over Croatia in early June, so there was early reason for optimism, but Rangnick’s Austria have slumped since.\n\nIn UEFA Nations League B, Rangnick and Austria may find themselves facing more evenly matched opposition, or they could even land England.\n\nBut it does have a drawback, with Austria now falling into Pot 2 for the Euro 2024 qualifying draw.\n\nAustria will not be at the World Cup later this year, failing to qualify before Rangnick took charge.\n\nCost of dismissing Rangnick\n\nThe Sun reported last week that United’s decision to end Rangnick’s consultancy early cost the club £15 million, a staggering sum to pay in compensation.\n\nThis excessive sum highlights how badly run United have been, hiring a consultant to do a manager’s job, and then getting rid of him before he could do the job he was best at.\n\nPerhaps Erik ten Hag simply didn’t need the help, but a bizarre summer transfer window which saw United chase Marko Arnautovic and Adrien Rabiot suggested the club did need some strategic guidance. United paid a lot not to have this.\n\nFor now Rangnick is back in management rather than consultancy, it’s just not going too well, and he will need to figure out how to be a winning coach again.\n\nShow all",
    "Football Match Report": "Croatia qualified for the Nations League semi-finals next year as defender Dejan Lovren marked his return to the team with a rare goal in a comprehensive 3-1 victory over relegated Austria in Vienna on Sunday.\n\nLovren, playing his first international in almost a year, scored the third goal for the visitors, who topped League A Group 1 with 13 points from six matches, one point ahead of second-placed Denmark. Austria finished bottom.\n\nLuka Modric gave Croatia an early lead with his 23rd international goal as he took a touch to control Nikola Vlasic's pass and fired low into the net.\n\nThat joy was short-lived as Austria equalised three minutes later when Christoph Baumgartner glanced Marcel Sabitzer's cross into the net with a deft header.\n\nBut two goals in three minutes midway through the second period sealed the points for Croatia as Marko Livaja headed home at the back post after a cross from Ivan Perisic, before Lovren was left free by the home defenders to score with a header from Lovro Majer's cross.\n\nDespite the loss, it was a special night for home forward Marko Arnautovic, who won an Austrian record 104th international cap and moved past Andreas Herzog at the top of the country's list of most appearances.",
    "Austria to return stolen Māori and Moriori ancestral remains": "European museums are replete with items brought from far-flung seas. With the tides now changing, how do the original caretakers go about bringing their treasures home? (Audio aired September 2022).\n\nThe ancestral remains of about 64 Māori and Moriori will be welcomed home to Aotearoa this weekend, marking the biggest remains repatriation from Austria.\n\nForty-nine sets of the remains were collected by the notorious Austrian grave-robber and taxidermist Andreas Reischek, who exhumed and stole the remains when in New Zealand for 12 years between 1877 and 1889.\n\nAcross about 1500 pages of confusing handwritten diary entries which were translated, it was discovered that Reischek boasted of eluding Māori surveillance, exploiting New Zealand, and looting tapu (sacred) places when on his travels.\n\nThe remains will be flown this week from Vienna’s Natural History Museum to Te Papa in Wellington, where a pōwhiri will be held on Sunday.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n* Four Toi Moko welcomed back to New Zealand after 'long, wrong' journey to Germany\n\n* German museum agrees to return mummified Māori heads to NZ\n\n* Moriori Treaty Settlement to be signed: 'It's been a long wait'\n\n\n\nChristina Rittmansberger/Natural History Museum Vienna Te Arikirangi Mamaku-Ironside, Te Papa’s acting head of repatriation.\n\nThey will be transported using indigenous cultural customs and protocol, and accompanied by representatives of the Government’s repatriation programme, Māori cultural experts and representatives of Austria.\n\nThe remains’ return to Aotearoa marks the end of 77 years of negotiation with Austria: the first request to repatriate them was made in 1945.\n\n“There is a lot of pressure internally as well as externally [on museums] to decolonise their practices and take a more considered approach to their collections,” Te Papa’s acting head of repatriation Te Arikirangi Mamaku-Ironside said in an interview from Austria.\n\nThe repatriation was about reconciling the hurt caused to Aotearoa’s indigenous communities and facilitating a healing process, Mamaku-Ironside said.\n\nChristina Rittmansberger/Natural History Museum Vienna Dr Sabine Eggers, head of international collections at Vienna’s Natural History Museum.\n\nMore broadly, as repatriation became more common internationally, the process was allowing museums to take a “really hard look at themselves in the mirror”, and examine how their collections may no longer serve a purpose in contemporary society, he said.\n\nDr Sabine Eggers, the head of international collections at Vienna’s Natural History Museum, will accompany the remains on their journey back to Aotearoa.\n\nMamaku-Ironside said it was important for descendants and communities to be able to speak to Eggers about what happened to the remains, as an expression of humility from the European country.\n\nIn an interview, Eggers said Reischek knew he was doing something “completely wrong” when stealing the remains. She had previously personally written a report to Austrian authorities, explaining how the value of the remains was significantly higher for Māori and Moriori than could ever be for reasons related to science.\n\nChristina Rittmansberger/Natural History Museum Vienna Dr Eggers presents an inventory record relating of one of the ancestral remains taken by Andreas Reischek to experts.\n\nWhile Austria was not a country that colonised others, it had a colonial mindset, supported colonial powers and used colonial means to obtain artefacts, Eggers said.\n\nIt was an honour to help heal an “open wound”, she said.\n\nThe remains include skulls without mandibles, craniums, loose mandibles and maxilla fragments. Most of the 64 ancestors are thought to be stolen from the Chatham Islands, Whanganui, Christchurch, Lyttelton, Auckland and Northland.\n\nColonial collectors rarely recorded the origin of the remains they unlawfully took, meaning the identity and home of many may never be known.\n\nsupplied Andreas Reischek.

    "Austria will withdraw its Soldiers from EUFOR if the UN does not extend the Mandate": "Austrian Defense Minister Klaudia Tanner said that this country will withdraw its soldiers from the EUFOR “Althea” military mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina if the UN Security Council does not extend its mandate, writes Austrian Der Standard.\n\nAs stated in Der Standard, an international conflict with Russia could have dramatic consequences for Austria and its army. They point out that there is a risk of ending Austria’s most important foreign mission, which is participation in the peacekeeping operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nDer Standard explains that it is a UN mission and that Austria has been involved since 2004 despite its officially neutral status. Also, Austria has the largest contingent of soldiers, and has commanded the mission since 2009. The current commander-in-chief is Austrian Major General Anton Wessely.\n\nThey explain that, until now, the routine extension of the mandate, which happened at the beginning of November, was called into question because of the war in Ukraine.\n\nAs Der Standard has learned, the Austrian Ministry of Defense has already planned to abandon the Althea mission in case Russia blocks the extension of the mission in the Security Council. This summer, Minister Tanner’s office did a report on options in which all scenarios were presented.\n\nOptions include desertion, and military sources have confirmed that this option is theoretically and practically possible. Finally, the decision would be made by the Austrian government, as was the case with the withdrawal of peacekeeping troops from the Golan in 2013.\n\nThe government still hopes that the Kremlin will not block the extension of the mandate, but some suspect that Putin wants to create new unrest and divisions in the EU, which could easily be achieved by destabilizing the Balkans. Austrian media report that Putin could act on the invitation of the member of the Presidency, Milorad Dodik.\n\nAnother position, they state, is that Putin will not go that far because the military operation could continue even without a UN mandate, for example if the BiH Presidency requests NATO’s help despite the opposition of Milorad Dodik.\n\nIn the case that NATO is positioned without the consent of the UN Security Council, militarily neutral Austria would have a problem. Without the UN mandate, participation in the mission would be unthinkable, and the withdrawal of soldiers would be a realistic option, according to the Austrian Ministry of Defense, Der Standard learns.",
    "Mbappe cooks Austria! France star lets play do talking in Nations League after bizarre week": "Mbappe cooks Austria! France star lets play do talking in Nations League after bizarre week\n\nFrance moved one step closer to salvaging their Nations League campaign with a 2-0 win over Austria, their first of the competition.\n\nFrance top Austria 2-0\n\nMbappe and Giroud on target\n\nWin over Denmark sees Les Bleus avoid relegation\n\nWHAT HAPPENED? After a scoreless first half, France finally got their goal from Kylian Mbappe in the 56th minute. Following a giveaway in midfield, Olivier Giroud found the Paris Saint-Germain star, who slalomed through Austria's defence before ripping a beautiful shot into the back of the net. Giroud then doubled the advantage nine minutes later, effectively sealing the win for Les Bleus.\n\nTHE BIGGER PICTURE: The Nations League has been a struggle for France, who had failed to win each of their first four games. But now a win over Denmark would spare the reigning World Cup winners from an embarrassing relegation to the competition's lower tier. Beating Austria was also a relief for a squad that have dealt with more bizarre controversy this week.\n\nALL EYES ON: Who else but Mbappe? He had so much to do on his goal and, wow, did he do it. The PSG star has these moments where he simply takes over, and Thursday was another example of that as France march or, based on injuries, limp towards the World Cup.\n\nMATCH IN THREE PHOTOS:\n\nDID YOU KNOW? By starting Benoit Badiashile and Wesley Fofana, France handed two players their first caps. It's the first time two French starters have earned their first cap in the same match since Paul Pogba and Raphael Varane did so back in March 2013.\n\nTHE VERDICT: France got a vital win, but it may have come at a cost as Jules Kounde and Mike Maignan were removed at half-time due to injuries. They'll join Karim Benzema, Paul Pogba, N'Golo Kante, Presnel Kimpembe and Kingsley Coman among those dealing with injuries.\n\nWHAT NEXT FOR FRANCE? Les Bleus will wrap up the Nations League group stage against Denmark before looking ahead to a World Cup group featuring the Danes, Australia and Tunisia.",
    "Austrian neutrality after the invasion of Ukraine": "Austrian neutrality after the invasion of Ukraine Karl-Peter Schwarz\n\nWhile the invasion of Ukraine led to a wave of support for NATO membership in several countries, Austrians still believe their country should remain neutral.\n\nA statue of Athena, goddess of wisdom and war, stands in front of the Austrian parliament in Vienna. To abandon neutrality would require a two-thirds majority in the National Council – an unlikely development under the current circumstances. © Getty Images\n\n× In a nutshell The majority of Austrians do not want their country to join NATO\n\nThey expect Austria to cooperate with other European countries on defense\n\nPolitical voices calling for an end to neutrality are still a minority\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine resulted in a dramatic change of opinion in Nordic countries on the question of neutrality. For years, polls in Finland had shown that between 22 and 25 percent of respondents supported joining NATO, even after the annexation of Crimea and the secessionist uprisings staged by the Kremlin in eastern Ukraine. At the end of February 2022, however, 50 percent of the population was in favor. By June, it was 75 percent.\n\nIn Sweden, the shift was not as drastic, but nevertheless clear. In June, 60 percent were in favor of NATO accession. There, too, the Russian aggression against Ukraine in 2014 had had little impact on public opinion. In 2017, only 32 percent of respondents wanted to abandon neutrality.\n\nEven in Switzerland, which has been officially neutral since 1815, 52 percent of respondents in a survey conducted in May and June were in favor of closer collaboration with NATO. There is a growing recognition that small countries can only defend themselves by partnering with other states – which requires, among other things, coordinating weapons systems. For the first time in two decades, the proportion of Swiss citizens supporting neutrality declined, falling to 89 percent from 96 percent in January.\n\nGrowing support\n\nMeanwhile, support for neutrality in Austria remains high and continues to rise. Ninety-one percent of those surveyed said neutrality is important to them, with 70 percent calling it “very important” and 21 percent “rather important.” In 2019, only 81 percent had said neutrality mattered to them. Asked in the most recent polls about the prospect of joining NATO, almost two-thirds of Austrians (64 percent) opposed it. Only 16 percent were in favor.\n\nCompared to the Swiss Army, the Austrian Armed Forces are in a pitiful state.\n\nThis attitude toward neutrality reflects the lack of military readiness in the population. A 2014 survey conducted in 64 countries in 2014 found that 25 percent of Western Europeans would be willing to fight for their country. The regional differences were considerable, especially those between neutral countries. In Finland, 74 percent declared themselves willing to take up arms to defend their country, in Sweden 55 percent and in Switzerland 39 percent. In Austria, the figure was only 21 percent.\n\nSurrounded by five NATO members, Austrians feel largely protected despite the war in Ukraine. The shock caused by the invasion of neighboring Czechoslovakia by Warsaw Pact troops in August 1968 has been mostly forgotten. At that time, the Iron Curtain separated Austria from neighboring countries to the north, east and south. But since the country was integrated into the European Union in 1995, and since Austrian soldiers have joined military operations in crisis areas, it has been taken for granted that Austria can rely on external help in the event of an attack. Accession to the EU alone was a clear sign of the transition to a broader interpretation of neutrality.\n\nAustrian-style neutrality\n\nIn a guest commentary for the newspaper Die Presse, top Austrian diplomat Thomas Mayr-Harting recalled that the Austrians “were always for neutrality, but not necessarily for defense on their own. Even in the years of the Cold War – and in the best days of Austrian ‘space defense’ – the (unspoken) basic assumption was always that we must be able to defend ourselves in the event of an attack from the outside until ‘others’ come to our aid.”\n\nBut if Austria relies on defense within the framework of Western states, Mr. Mayr-Harting argues, the Federal Armed Forces must be interoperable and trained according to NATO standards. The NATO Partnership for Peace (PfP), in which Austria has been participating since 1995, provides a good basis for such cooperation.\n\nEmbedded in the structures of the EU and relying on the EU assistance clause, which calls for solidarity between the member states, 55 percent of Austrians surveyed recently assessed their country’s situation as “safe” or “rather safe,” while only 20 percent consider Europe, on the whole, to be safe. Nevertheless, Austrians consider the Federal Armed Forces to be “very” or “rather important,” not least because they have proven themselves in disaster operations. In the survey, conducted shortly after the beginning of the war, 50 percent of respondents supported increasing the defense budget (which amounted to 0.8 percent of gross domestic product in 2021) and equipping the Federal Armed Forces with heavy weapons to enable it to repel attacks.\n\nThe majority of Austrians believe their country is not at risk. The 1968 invasion of neighboring then-Czechoslovakia has been mostly forgotten. © Getty Images\n\nRoots of neutrality\n\nCompared to the Swiss Army, the Austrian Armed Forces are in a pitiful state. Defense expert Franz-Stefan Gady estimates that it would take 10 to 20 years to build an operational army in Austria that could compete with that of Switzerland. Critics of neutrality accuse Austria of free riding on NATO in the field of security policy.\n\nAustrian neutrality began with the Moscow Memorandum of April 1955. To achieve the “closest conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty,” the Austrian delegation in Moscow conceded that Austria would not join any military alliances and would not allow military bases on its territory. The Austrian government issued a statement that establishes “permanent neutrality based on the Swiss model.” The Soviet Union then agreed to sign the Austrian State Treaty and consented to the withdrawal of all occupying forces.\n\nOn 26 October 1955, the Austrian National Council (Parliament) passed the Neutrality Act. But neutrality is not included in the State Treaty, and its interpretation is therefore not subject to the former occupying powers. It is not guaranteed by any international treaty.\n\nOn the other hand, the obligation to “maintain and defend perpetual neutrality” is enshrined in the constitution. It could only be repealed with a two-thirds majority in the National Council. None of the parties represented in parliament is currently calling for the abandonment of neutrality.\n\nBrussels is said to be reluctant to include Austria in the defense community.\n\nAt the turn of the millennium, things were different. At that time, the black-blue coalition government led by Wolfgang Schussel of the Christian-democratic Austrian People’s Party (OVP) initiated a debate on joining NATO. The initiative failed because the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPO) rejected the motion, and an amendment or deletion of the neutrality law required their consent. When Social Democrat Alfred Gusenbauer succeeded Mr. Schussel in 2006, the topic was off the table. Only the Freedom Party of Austria (FPO) insisted on joining NATO until the matter gradually faded away after significant intraparty changes. Under chairman Herbert Kickl, the FPO today has adopted a neutral, but essentially Russia-friendly, position toward the war in Ukraine.\n\nAfter the Russian invasion, there were isolated voices in the OVP calling for accession to NATO. However, Chancellor Karl Nehammer (OVP) stated that “Austria was neutral, Austria is neutral, Austria will also remain neutral.”\n\nForeign Minister Alexander Schallenberg (OVP) also declared that in a world “in which economic, military and intellectual conflicts have become more open, neutrality could once again be a value.”\n\nCalls for change\n\nThe SPO believes that a neutral Austria in a mediating role contributes more to peace than if it were a member of a military pact. Only the leftist liberal NEOS raises doubts whether neutrality is still the best solution for Austria.\n\nIn an “open letter to the Federal President, the Federal Government, the National Council and the people of Austria,” more than 50 Austrian security experts, diplomats, entrepreneurs, politicians and columnists called for the adoption of a new security doctrine in May. Neutrality has never been checked for its current expediency but has been “elevated to a supposedly inviolable myth,” the signatories argue. Among them are Brigadier General of the Austrian Armed Forces Walter Feichtinger and former FPO Defense Minister Friedhelm Frischenschlager, as well as far-left columnists Robert Misik and Julya Rabinowich.\n\nAustria, the letter says, has neglected increasing threats for too long. Today, the country is “unprepared, and in the most serious security policy crisis in Europe since 1945.” The signatories have different opinions on neutrality or NATO accession, but are all “convinced that the status quo of our security policy is not only untenable, but dangerous for our country.”\n\nNATO has not commented on the debate in Austria, which has not yet really begun. Brussels is said to be reluctant to include Austria in the defense community. The contribution that NATO expects from the small country can be fulfilled even without accession.\n\nIt is extremely unlikely that one or more parties represented in the Austrian parliament will table a motion to repeal the Neutrality Act in this or the next legislative period. This would not be the case even if the Russian war against Ukraine were to escalate.",

    "Protests erupt across Austria demanding solution to cost of living crisis : Peoples Dispatch": "On Saturday, September 17, trade unions and other working class sections hit the streets across Austria protesting the government’s inefficiency in tackling the ongoing cost of living crisis. The protests called by the Austrian Trade Union Federation (OGB) saw the participation of various groups including the Party of Labor of Austria (PdA), Youth Front, Communist Youth of Austria (KJO), Communist Party of Austria (KPO), and Links, among others. Marches were held in cities in all federal States including Vienna, Eisenstadt, Bruck an der Mur, Salzburg, Innsbruck, Bregenz, Lower Austria, and Upper Austria. According to the organizers, over 30,000 people participated in the protests, with 20,000 people having marched in Vienna alone. The protesters called on the politicians to take concrete actions to tackle the current crisis.\n\nPeople across Europe have been reeling under an acute cost of living crisis marked by soaring inflation in food and fuel prices. Due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and sanctions imposed by the European Union (EU) and the US on Russian gas exports to Europe, energy prices have skyrocketed in European countries. Profiteering by multinational energy producers and suppliers despite this crisis has worsened the situation, including in Austria. According to Statistics Austria, the inflation rate for August 2022 in the country was 9.3% and the minimum consumer basket (cost of household consumption and essential services) is around 16% higher than last year, reported Zeitung der Arbeit (ZdA).\n\nThe OGB said, “whether at the supermarket checkout or petrol pump, when looking at the electricity bill or paying rent, prices explode and with them the profits of a few companies and corporations, while many people face enormous problems.”\n\n“For months, OGB and trade unions have been warning of inflation and have presented concrete plans on how quickly help can be provided. But far too little has happened. The OGB therefore calls for rapid measures to relieve the burden. Prices of energy, housing, food, and transport must go down!” OGB added.\n\nIn order to tackle the cost of living crisis, OGB has put forth a set of demands, including an energy cap on electricity and gas bills, a special tax on surplus profits of big companies, abolition of VAT on food for a certain period, constitution of an anti-inflation commission, reduction of tax on fuel, removing VAT on public transport, massive expansion of public transport, and legislation for a rent cap.\n\nOn September 18, Tibor Zenker from the leadership of the PdA told Peoples Dispatch (PD), “The capitalist crises are leading to massive inflation in Austria. Many people can no longer afford the cost, especially for energy, but also housing and food. Wages are too low and the working class is impoverished, while capital is gaining record profits. The conservative government remains inactive. The Party of Labor of Austria calls for resistance. A general strike is needed. The demands are for wage increases above the inflation rate, state price regulations, and taxation of wealth and corporate profits. The working class is not begging for charity but fighting for its rights.”\n\nThe KJO stated, “We can hardly afford to live anymore while the capitalist class increases their profits in times of inflation crisis. The politics of begging for handouts will do nothing. Only a militant movement can counter the capitalist madness.”",
    "Time to accept that obesity is a disease – Austria is building a national system to treat it": "Obesity needs to be treated just like any other disease that threatens people’s lives. To fight obesity effectively, policy-makers, health professionals and other stakeholders need to create a health system that ensures that every person has access to high quality care for the management of overweight and obesity. Austria is currently working on a such a system that can bring obesity treatment to the next level.\n\nFighting obesity: treatment is just the beginning\n\nNina, a girl from a rural area in Austria, was diagnosed with obesity and a very heavy individual burden of comorbidities when she was 14 years old. After medication treatment and significant weight reduction, she was dismissed from hospital. But as she lived a 2.5-hour drive away from the clinic, she lost contact with her doctors 8 months after treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Nina came back, she had not only regained weight but also had type 2 diabetes.\n\n“Cases such as Nina’s show that treatment may aid, but it can never be sufficient if doctor-patient relations are not maintained, and if there is no national system that gives clear guidelines on how obesity should be treated,” said Dr Daniel Weghuber, Head of the pediatrics department at the University Clinic of Child and Adolescent Medicine of Paracelsus Medical University in Salzburg.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, there are around 240 000 children and adolescents living with overweight and obesity in Austria.\n\n\n\n\n\nA recent report from WHO/Europe showed that, in the entire WHO European Region, around 60% of adults and 1 in 3 children are living with this condition. Halting the rise in obesity is going to require comprehensive policy approaches, both in the areas of obesity prevention, such as through creating healthy food and physical activity environments, and in the areas of obesity and overweight management.\n\nObesity treatment as part of general insurance\n\nAs President of the European Childhood Obesity Group, Dr Weghuber has been leading the work on a national concept on childhood obesity treatment for Austria, which is based on the idea that obesity is a serious chronic disease that is tightly connected with other noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) including cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe concept was prepared by professionals from primary to tertiary health care and signed by all relevant stakeholders, including representatives of the social security sector, in 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nWHO has been urging Member States to take further steps in halting the so-called global obesity epidemic by 2025, as no country in the Region is on track to halt or even reduce the rise of obesity by this date.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, Austria is ready for the next step. Leading health professionals and stakeholders launched a nation-wide initiative called Austrian Obesity Alliance. The Alliance proposes a renewed obesity management programme that acknowledges obesity as a disease and demands that the social security system includes obesity management in the universal health insurance system.\n\nMany people don’t see obesity as a problem\n\nThere are several regions in Austria that have already created the infrastructure for the planned national obesity treatment programme. These structures can be scaled up to other regions of the country. But to roll out the programme, political commitment based on the understanding that obesity is a serious public health challenge is also crucial.\n\n\n\n\n\n“We need to change the perception of obesity that is prevalent today,” said Dr Michael Krebs, Specialist for Internal Medicine of the Medical University of Vienna. “There are more than 3 million adults and 240 000 children with overweight and obesity in Austria representing a wide range of demographics. Yet, more than 85% of obesity patients seeking treatment in our outpatient clinic are women. That means that most men living with obesity don’t see their condition as a disease – or don’t want to treat it for whatever reason.”\n\n\n\n\n\nIn many countries in the Region, obesity is still associated with social stigma, and it multiplies the life-threatening risks of this medical condition. Health professionals need help from decision-makers to get evidence-based messages and WHO recommendations through to a wider audience.\n\n“We need to accept that obesity is a disease”\n\n“Countries need to adopt a comprehensive approach to obesity prevention and management,” said Dr Kremlin Wickramasinghe, Acting Head of the WHO European Office for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases. “We learned a lot from listening to people living with obesity and their families, and we encourage all governments to take measures to also get inputs from these important stakeholders for all stages of the obesity policy cycle.”\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the 72nd session of the WHO Regional Committee for Europe (RC72), to be held in September 2022 in Israel, high-level stakeholders and decision-makers from all 53 Member States of the Region will discuss best practices that can stop the increase of obesity levels and tackle this urgent problem.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustria is an active participant in many of the related WHO projects including the Childhood Obesity Surveillance Initiative (COSI) and the WHO Marketing Network. These projects are helping health professionals and stakeholders to create an effective country-tailored system to fight obesity.\n\n\n\n\n\n“We need to accept that obesity is a disease. And since it’s a chronic disease, every person with obesity has to be diagnosed, and in each case a treatment needs to be defined. This is the future,” concluded Dr Weghuber.\n\n\n\n",
    "Bet-at-home warns of increased liquidity risk after Austria shutdown": "Bet-at-home has warned of an increased risk that it may not have sufficient liquidity to meet financial obligations when they are due, after a financial year heavily impacted by its exit from Austria.\n\nThe warning comes in the context of a significant winding down of the company’s activities in other regions, most notably Austria.\n\nIn October 2021, the business lost a legal battle against a consortium of players in Austria who sought compensation from unlicensed operators. Following this, Bet-at-home announced it would be exiting the market, as well as winding down the Maltese company set up to target it.\n\nIn July, Bet-at-home announced that it had “surrendered” its GB licence, and would be permanently withdrawing from the market – this occurred in the wake of the operator’s licence suspension by the Gambling Commission for suspected anti-money laundering and social responsibility failings.\n\nAs a result of these exits, Bet-at-home has categorised its liquidity risk level as “medium”, and higher than last year, as the reduction in operations create uncertainty in the company’s cash flow, assets and liabilities.\n\nBet-at-home stated that even small negative shocks may leave the business with a shortfall:\n\n“If the bet-at-home.com AG Group is unable to provide corresponding collateral in the form of bank guarantees, existing cash and cash equivalents would have to be deposited as security,” the report states.\n\n“The remaining freely available liquidity could prove to be critical even in the event of minor negative deviations from the existing planning if, in addition, a significant reduction in liquidity were to occur due to payments to Bet-at-home.com Entertainment Ltd. and to the Maltese tax authorities.\n\nIn the context of the operator’s reorientation of strategy, Bet-at-home abandoned its in-house platform, and will be using the EveryMatrix technology stack going forward, in an effort to cut costs.\n\nHowever, there was also good news for the operator. The business revealed it was “assured” in July by the State Administration Office of Saxony-Anhalt that it will be granted an online casino licence.\n\nThe business said it expects the licence to be issued in the second half of 2022, following its application which it entered following the 2021 passage of the German state treaty on gambling.",
    "Irregular migrant influx to Austria hits record high": "The government is being urged to tackle the issue of irregular migration as more than 3,000 irregular migrants and refugees entered Austria this week, topping the record reached in the first week of September.\n\nAs presidential elections are set for 9 October, and most nominees are on the far right side of the political spectrum, the campaign has brought issues like migration to the fore.\n\nAustria has seen a massive influx in the number of refugees this year as it registered 47,000 refugees, compared to the 19,000 registered for 2021. Most are from the Middle East, particularly Afghanistan, Pakistan and India.\n\n“One negative record follows the next each week. But this still does not seem to prompt the current ÖVP Minister of the Interior, Karner, to act,” explained Hannes Amesbauer, security spokesman for the far-right FPÖ, who added a warning of “100,000 illegal refugees.”\n\nThe government has also fallen prey to the Social Democratic SPÖ, currently in opposition.\n\n“Interior Minister Karner is completely overwhelmed with the asylum agendas,” the party explained. They note a failure to look for “sensible” international solutions.\n\nRefugee issues have dominated Austrian politics for years, with the most restrictive policies implemented during the two-year term of far-right FPÖ Interior Minister Herbert Kickl.\n\nThis means the left-leaning incumbent Alexander van der Bellen may be challenged, as salient refugee politics historically favour the right.\n\nIf the incumbent fails to achieve a single majority in the first round, the right uniting behind FPÖ candidate Walter Rosenkranz could challenge van der Bellen.\n\nA similar run-off in 2016 had the far-right close to victory.\n\n(Nikolaus J.

ALEX HALADA/AFP via Getty Images\n\nST POLTEN, Austria -- Two supporters protesting against the death of Mahsa Amini, the 22-year-old woman who died in police custody in Iran earlier this month after being charged for allegedly wearing a headscarf improperly, were ejected from Iran's friendly international against Uruguay by police in Austria after entering the supposedly-behind closed door fixture in St Polten.\n\nPolice approached the two men midway through the first half of the game in the NV Arena, 50 miles from Vienna, and asked them to hand over the placard which said Amini was 'murdered by the police of the Islamic Republic of Iran.'\n\nAfter failing to persuade the supporters to end their protest, police marched the men out of the stadium.\n\nThe death of Amini has sparked widespread protests in Iran which have seen women take to the streets without hijabs (headscarves) and cut their hair in a show of defiance.\n\nAs a result of the situation in Iran, the country's government insisted that the national team's friendly game against Uruguay be played behind closed doors to nullify the prospect of further protests.\n\nBut despite the game officially being listed as a 'behind closed doors' fixture, fans from both teams were allowed into the NV Arena, with the main stand populated by around 400 spectators.\n\nBefore the game, media were told that neither Iran coach Carlos Queiroz or any of the team's players would be available for interview after the fixture.",

    "Austria's OETI celebrates 55 yrs of testing, certifying, accreditation": "As an accredited testing and certification body, the 'OETI - Institut fuer Oekologie, Technik und Innovation GmbH' has been responding to prevailing requirements for 55 years and, in the process, has made a name for itself. To mark its anniversary, this centre is taking a look at its most important milestones and also provides insights into developments.\n\n\"As renowned flooring manufacturers founded the Austrian Carpet Institute on 25th of September 1967, no one could have imagined how successful the company would become. But even back then, one thing was clear to the experts: the need to establish a carpet research and testing centre in the form of an association. And its success proved them right. Today, over five decades later, OETI is a testing and certification services provider for OEKO-TEX certificates and labels, textiles, leather, due diligence along the textile and leather supply chain as well as for personal protective equipment (PPE), flooring technology, furnishings and indoor air quality,\" OETI said in a media release.\n\nAs an accredited testing and certification body, the 'OETI - Institut fuer Oekologie, Technik und Innovation GmbH' has been responding to prevailing requirements for 55 years and, in the process, has made a name for itself. To mark its anniversary, this centre is taking a look at its most important milestones and also provides insights into developments.\n\nInnovation as well as high quality standards were also important criteria behind the institute’s continuous market development and constant competitiveness right from the start, explained managing director Robert Löcker. “We work together with our customers to bring new ideas for product developments to life and award products, services, production processes and production facilities the 'Inspected Quality' label. We also test and certify indoor air quality in line with the Cleanair standard, which is based on stringent national and international guidelines.”\n\nIn 1992, OETI was a founding member of the ‘International OEKO-TEX Association for Research and Testing in the Field of Textile and Leather Ecology’ with independent certifications and product labels. Ever since, OEKO-TEX has enabled companies along the textile and leather supply chain and every consumer to make responsible decisions for safe, environmentally friendly and fairly manufactured products.\n\nAnother pioneering step occurred in 1994: OETI was one of the first Austrian institutes to be accredited under the new Accreditation Act in accordance with EN 45001, a major and important milestone for future collaborations and the domestic market.\n\nIn line with its focus on sustainability, OETI and its Swiss parent company, Testex AG, wanted to build the new OETI headquarters using low energy construction techniques and ensure its carbon-neutral operation. To achieve these goals, the highest possible thermal insulation and energy optimisation standards were applied, while the carbon-neutral power supply is generated by its in-house photovoltaics system as well as domestic renewable energy, the release added.\n\nThe new headquarters, which the company moved into in 2021, provides space for 75 employees over 2,500 square metres. The laboratory areas, the analytical/chemical laboratory and the physical/fire laboratory were also designed based on the latest methods and technologies. This makes OETI, alongside its Swiss parent company Testex, the second fully fledged laboratory site in the entire, global Testex Group.\n\nFrom 1967 through to the present, OETI has been constantly changing. An important cornerstone of this adaptability is the establishment of international subsidiaries and a consistent internationalisation strategy. This led to the foundation of subsidiaries in Egypt, the Czech Republic and Ukraine between 2007 and 2010. And further sales offices were regularly added from 2014: Turkey, Moldova, Italy, Iran, Morocco, Israel, North-Macedonia, Croatia, Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\n“We know that the market for our services will change dramatically in the coming decades due to technological and social factors. In order to successfully celebrate our 100th anniversary as well, OETI will be very flexible with those services that will continue to help both consumers and industry in the future, locally and regionally, wherever they are needed.” Specific plans include a renewed focus on internationalisation and market expansion to the Indian subcontinent, with the addition of two new sites in India and Bangladesh in 2022. “We also want to extensively expand our portfolio and comprehensive consulting service, as well as accelerate our growth through corporate acquisitions in the future,” Löcker, added.\n\nFibre2Fashion News Desk (RR)",
    "Austria's inflation remains above 9 pct in Aug.": "VIENNA, Sept. 16 (Xinhua) -- Inflation in Austria remained over the high level of 9 percent in August, Statistics Austria said on Friday.\n\nAt 9.3 percent, inflation in August was 0.1 percentage points lower than the revised July inflation rate of 9.4 percent. However, energy and food prices have continued to soar despite anti-inflation government policies, Statistics Austria said.\n\nThe slight month-on-month decline was due to fuel prices, which fell by 10.4 percent compared to July. However, although statistics Austria said the August inflation rate would have stood at 9.9 percent without the decline in fuel prices, they remain the strongest driver of annual inflation.\n\n\"The trend of rising prices remained unbroken for household energy, food and restaurants,\" said Tobias Thomas, director general of Statistics Austria.\n\nThe Austrian government has introduced several packages of measures to combat inflation, including increasing social benefits for the unemployed and other vulnerable groups. ■",

    "Posting workers to Austria": "An overview of Corporate obligations when posting your workers to Austria to perform a temporary provision of services.\n\nIn Austria, the provisions of the Directive on the Posting of Workers (Directive 96/71/EC) and of the Enforcement Directive 2014/67/EU have been implemented into national legislation by means of the Anti-Wage and Social Dumping Act (LSD-BG), published in Federal Law Gazette Part I № 44/2016. In addition, the provisions of the LSD-BG ensure compliance with Austrian wage and working conditions, prevent wage and social dumping by foreign companies.\n\n1. Formal requirements companies have to meet when posting workers to Austria\n\nUnder Section 19 of the LSD-BG, companies established in an EEA Member State must notify the Central Coordinating Agency (ZKO) of the Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) of the posting of any worker in the context of a temporary provision of services in Austria.\n\nHence, foreign employers and agencies posting their employees to carry out work in Austria have to notify the ZKO in electronic form using the web form ZKO3. The notification shall be submitted prior to the start of the working activities in Austria at the latest.\n\nIn accordance with § 23 LSD-BG, when posting workers to Austria, the posting company shall designate a contact person to liase with the authorities. In particular, the contact person is either one of the posted employees, or a professional legal representative domiciled in Austria. Furthermore, the contact person shall keep copies of:\n\nThe notification of posting (ZKO3);\n\nSocial security document A1/E101 or equivalent documents;\n\nIn the case of third country citizens, an official work permit in the country of domicile, if required;\n\nPay documents and records of hours worked.\n\nIn the event of any subsequent changes of the original notification, companies shall submit a change report without delay. Circumstances requiring the transmission of a change report include any change of the actual place or places of work, of the posting period or the cancellation of the posting.\n\n2. Exception to the obligation of notification\n\nGenerally, certain cross-border work activities do not fall under Austrian regulations governing minimum remuneration, registration and notification. For instance, the exception to the obligation of notification applies if the posted worker performs the following work in Austria:\n\nBusiness meetings;\n\nParticipating in seminars, presentations, conventions and conferences; activities as part of international programmes of advanced training and research at universities;\n\nParticipation in trade fairs and similar events, etc.\n\nSince the amendment to the Austrian Anti-Wage and Social Dumping Act (LSD-BG), other exemptions apply to postings of skilled workers within a company group for a maximum total of two months per calendar year and for the purpose of research and development, training, planning project activities, business consulting, controlling or collaborating with departments of the company group which are responsible for central management and planning for more than one country.\n\n3. Posting of third-countries workers employed by EEA companies to Austria\n\nIn case the posted employee(s) come from third countries, the ZKO automatically forwards the notification to the Public Employment Service (AMS). Pursuant to Section 18 para. 12 of the Employment of Foreigners Act (AuslBG), the AMS is competent to issue an EU Posting confirmation and to allow the posting of a non-EU worker. To do so, the AMS verifies that the third-country worker is:\n\nProperly employed in the posting country, and Employed in Austria in accordance with Austrian wage and working conditions during the posting period.\n\nIn order to allow the verification of the above requirements, the posting company must include in the notification details of the employment permit and of the residence permit which were issued in the posting country.\n\nThe regional office of the AMS shall, within two weeks, confirm to the posting company that the requisite conditions are met, and issues an EU posting confirmation or, if they are not met, ban such posting.\n\n4. Obligation to keep posting documents readily available\n\nForeign employers, posting his workers to Austria, must keep the following documents readily available at the place of work during the entire posting period or make them accessible electronically on site:\n\nA copy of the ZKO3 report and any reports regarding subsequent modifications, as well as\n\nDocuments regarding the employees’ registration for social security insurance (A1 Certificate or E 101), or equivalent documents, such as the application for the issuance of the A1 or E 101.\n\nIf an official permit is required to employ the posted workers in the country where the employer is established, this permit or a copy thereof must also be kept readily available.\n\nBesides, each company posting its staff to Austria shall keep all salary documents that are necessary to determine the wages due to the employees according to Austrian legislation readily available in German, during the entire period of the posting, meaning:\n\nRequired wage or salary documents in German;\n\nEmployment contract;\n\nPay slips and proof of wage payment or bank transfer statements;\n\nWage or salary records;\n\nRecords of hours worked and;\n\nDocuments relating to pay categorisation in order to verify the remuneration that is payable to the posted worker under Austrian law for the duration of the employment.\n\n5. Austrian working and salary conditions\n\nWhen posted to Austria to perform a temporary provision of services, workers must comply with Austrian regulations on working time and rest periods. Generally, the normal daily working time is 8 hours, while the weekly working time amounts to 40 hours, excluding overtime. In addition, the maximum of overtime allowed per week is 20 hours. Finally, the minimum rest period under Austrian law is of 11 consecutive hours after daily working time.\n\nFurthermore, employees posted to Austria shall receive at least the amount of remuneration that is due them in Austria pursuant to a statute, ordinance or collective agreement.\n\nIt is therefore particularly important, prior to posting workers, to be aware of the minimum wage levels stipulated in the applicable Austrian collective agreement.\n\n6. Further obligations: BUAK and Dienstleistungsanzeige\n\nIn the construction sector, foreign employers posting their workers to Austria need to observe a number of special regulations related to the Austrian Construction Workers’ Holiday and Severance Pay Fund (Bauarbeiter-Urlaubs- und Abfertigungskasse, BUAK).\n\nTherefore, the foreign employer needs to comply with a series of requirements, namely:\n\nReport the posting for the purpose of construction works in Austria;\n\nMeet the conditions for the employees’ annual leave entitlement by remitting to the BUAK the monthly wage supplements for the category of annual leave (‘annual leave supplements’ and ‘holiday pay fund procedure’);\n\nPay the employees at least the minimum wage in Austria as stipulated in the collective agreement;\n\nIn the event that construction workers are hired out to an Austrian user undertaking and the workers continue to be covered by social insurance in their home country, a contribution to the BUAK’s AÜG-Fonds-Service for the social and continuing training fund (SO-Beitrag), in addition to the annual leave supplement.\n\n6.1. The Dienstleistungsanzeige to carry on regulated trade in Austria\n\nAccording to Section 373a of the Gewerbeordnung 1994 (GewO 1994), if a foreign company wishes to carry on a regulated trade in Austria, they have to notify the competent authority before starting their operations. Such notification is the Dienstleistungsanzeige and must be renewed once a year if the company intends to provide services in Austria during the year in question.\n\nSection 94 of the GewO 1994 specifies which are the regulated business activities for which it is necessary to apply for a Dienstleistungsanzeige. They include, for instance, metal technology for metal and mechanical engineering.\n\nThe competent authorities for issuing the Dienstleistungsanzeige is the Federal Ministry of Labour and Economy (BMAW). To submit the application, the foreign company shall provide a series of documents, including:\n\nAttestation about the lawful establishment in the member or contracting state;\n\nAttestation regarding activities previously pursued exercise of the activity concerned;\n\nProfessional qualification of the responsible legal representative;\n\nFor certain trades, proof of absence of criminal records (e.g. security trade) or of the conclusion of liability insurance (e.g. real estate trustee).\n\n7.

The government is also “working against the campaign with its falsely constructed electricity price cap because it is not encouraging the majority of households to save energy,” she added.\n\nAccording to environmental organisations Greenpeace and WWF, the energy saving campaign is a first step in the right direction. However, additional measures such as pushing through an energy efficiency law, are also needed.",

    "Arlberg, Austria: A novice in the land of the world's best skiers": "For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript. Here are the instructions how to enable JavaScript in your web browser .\n\nYou must treat the snow like your dance partner, says ski instructor Nils Otto as we float in a gondola high above the Arlberg. The allegory is especially apt from this perspective: far below us, skis carve movement and rhythm into the enamel-bright snow as their wearers shimmy and sway towards the valley floor. These performers are the dance troupe, and we their box seat audience.\n\n\"The snow isn't your enemy,\" Otto reaffirms. \"You need to make friends with it.\"\n\nSee Also Austria travel guide\n\nMy relationship with the snow is fraught; a novice skier, I fool no-one with my quivering gait and fear-contorted expression. Compounding my unease is the Arlberg's reputation: this region is the cradle of alpine skiing, and it has forged the careers of some of the world's most accomplished skiers. It is threaded today with the laser-sharp tracks of people who clearly know what they're doing. If you learn to ski in the Arlberg you'll be able to ski anywhere in the world, says the legend. If only I had known.\n\nBut these somewhat intimidating credentials don't preclude beginners and intermediate skiers; they're matched, moreover, by attributes I'm easily able to appreciate: singular landscapes, enchanted settlements, captivating histories. Nestled in the valley below are the hamlets of St Anton and St Christoph, and beyond them the three other villages anchoring the Arlberg: Stuben, Zurs and Lech. Mountains bulwark the valleys and serrate the skyline overhead. Slopes and fields, canopies and rooftops slump beneath enormous pillows of snow. The sky is radiantly blue.\n\n\"You just have to enjoy every sunbeam, because tomorrow the weather might change,\" Otto says.\n\n\"Lean into your fear. Let's make friends with speed!\"\n\nSunshine and speed alchemise into a hallucinatory drug as I launch myself from the top of a run into what feels like endless freefall. Spangled ice sprays my cheeks, gravity wrenches my nerves, wind roars by like a freight train. I skid to a breathless, clumsy halt at the bottom of the run and wait for my defibrillated heart to quieten. That night, on my way to Museum Restaurant and Cafe – a gingerbread manse tucked into a grove of trees at the base of a run – I see night skiers rippling like pebbles down ghostly slopes. They're returning from après ski, says a woman at the restaurant. They ski down tipsy and lose things; then, when the snow melts in the spring, all sorts of lost property emerges from the thaw.\n\n\"Beanies, wallets, gloves, phones,\" the woman says.\n\nThe Tyrolean-style hunting lodge in which the restaurant is housed conceals its own surprises: it was built by German industrialist Bernhard Trier in 1912 after the railway was laid through the valley in the late 19th century, bringing settlers along with it. Influential people would gather here – including alpine ski pioneer Hannes Schneider, who was born in nearby Stuben. During WWII the house became a refuge for injured soldiers and, during the occupation, home to the French governor. Today it has reclaimed its Austrian heritage: its antique-filled rooms are set for dinner and weary skiers are refuelling with immense Wiener schnitzels, dumplings swimming in oxtail consommé and kaiserschmarren – a shredded pancake-and-fruit pudding named for Emperor Franz Joseph I. Outside stands a towering pine tree; its outstretched limbs glitter with Christmas baubles, guiding the après skiers home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOvernight, a blizzard blots the sky and shutters St Christoph's ski lifts. I clip snowshoes to my boots and cut a ponderous trail through the drifts; the gondolas sway idle and empty above me. It's a short drive to Stuben along the Arlberg Pass, which cuts from Tyrol into Vorarlberg and zigzags through precipitous mountains into the valley. But the journey wasn't always so effortless: travellers crossing the Arlberg would take respite in huts built in Stuben for this purpose.\n\nAnd the village is indeed a sight for weary eyes, though it lies deathly still beneath last night's snowfall. The walls of the ivory-painted church, Filialkirche Stuben, appear to have been erased altogether: only its dome and gothic windows are traced in black against the spectre; its gold cross is lacklustre in the gloom. But warmth is restored at Hotel Mondschein, where local specialities – schmalz, sausages, schnapps – are being served in a restaurant lined with photos of the village's world-famous son, Hannes Schneider.\n\n\"Around 1900, he noticed ski was up and coming,\" says Gebhard Pichler, Stuben's tourism director. \"He built his own skis from a wooden barrel. People laughed at him – his father wouldn't let him get skis.\"\n\nSchneider's father, a farmer, had expected his son to become a cheesemaker. Instead, he went on to develop the world-famous Arlberg technique, which helps such novices as me progress from simple snowploughs to complex parallel turns. Schneider made a hard turn himself when the Nazis annexed Austria; he fled to New Hampshire, spreading the cherished reputation of his home village as he went.\n\nInnate caution has hampered my own mastery of Schneider's technique, but I marvel at it from the gondola high above Zurs. The world below is a tumbling ocean of white, sullied only by the protruding roofs of entombed huts; skiers skim the bright surface, leaving precision strokes in their wake. I discover a counterpoint to this monochrome vista down in the village at Filialkirche Christkönig; stepping over snow drifts into the nave, I'm enfolded in colour: the emerging sun has cast Martin Häusle's fabled stained glass windows upon the walls in oblongs of indigo, pink and violet.\n\nNearby, at Lech's old Kirche St Nikolaus, the long-dead are now drowned by snow; only the tips of their gravestones have been spared by the avalanche. But colour is the saviour again tonight at Kristiania Lech, where Gertrud Schneider curates art, history, books, conversation, cocktails and cuisine into a singular experience (the space now operates as a pop-up only during the summer months). The lodge was originally built by her father, Austria's first male Olympic ski champion Othmar Schneider, as a bolthole for friends.\n\n\"For us it was a castle,\" Schneider recalls of her childhood. \"We had to dress nicely and behave.\"\n\nIt's a tradition that endures: Schneider is an elegant host, offering flutes of champagne, recommending specialties, telling compelling stories of the Arlberg and the contemporary artists who exhibit in her gallery. The dining room is warmed by jewel colours; through the window, we can see lights speckling the dark: snow groomers gliding down the Lecher mountainside.\n\n\"It's a ballet of the snow cats,\" Schneider says.\n\nAnd from our sumptuous box-seat we watch the evening performance on that immense, snow-lit stage.\n\nCatherine Marshall was a guest of the Austrian National Tourist Office.\n\nTHE DETAILS\n\nFLY\n\nQatar flies daily from Sydney and Melbourne to Doha, with regular onward flights to Zurich.

    "Study in Austria: 4 best tuition-free options to consider": "Austria has become a popular international student hub — for good reasons. Located in Central Europe, the country ranks 16th in this year’s Best Student Cities ranking. Pair that with an estimated living cost of 1,000 euros, and it’s little surprise why many choose to study in Austria.\n\nTuition fees in Austrian universities are cheap, too. Like most European countries, Austrian students, nationals of all European Union (EU), and European Economic Area (EEA) member countries, generally do not pay tuition fees at public universities. For students outside these countries, you can expect to pay 726.72 euros.\n\nOn top of that, all students must pay 20 euros per semester, which covers the student union membership fee and accident insurance.\n\nThe best part? You have easy access to some of the incredible landscapes in Europe. Take, Lake Constance, for example. Here, you can soak in the view of idyllic spots, summer chateaus, charming towns and the majestic Alps. Adventure enthusiasts can take their pick from over 242 peaks in the country.\n\nIf you are a student outside the EU, EEA and Austria who wish to study in this picturesque country, here’s why you should consider these tuition-free options:\n\nStudy in Austria: Best tuition-free universities for international students\n\n1. The University of Vienna\n\nThe University of Vienna is known as one of the oldest universities in Europe. It is located in the heart of the city of Vienna and is one of two institutions in Austria that is included in the QS World University Rankings 2023.\n\nAt its core, the university promotes diversity through research. With 15 faculties and five centres, students can choose to study advanced theological studies, law, zoology, and many more. Plus, you’ll interact with students from 140 countries for a vibrant student experience.\n\nTuition for students who are citizens of a non-EU or EEA country costs 726.72 euros per semester, plus a student’s union fee of 21.20 euros.\n\n2. The University of Salzburg\n\nNestled in architecturally breathtaking buildings in Salzburg’s city centre, the University of Salzburg — also known as Paris Lodron University Salzburg — is Salzburg’s largest educational institution.\n\nThe university is home to six faculties, including the Faculty of Catholic Theology, Faculty of Cultural Sciences, Faculty of Digital and Analytical Sciences, Faculty of Law, Business and Economics, Faculty of Natural and Life Sciences, and Faculty of Social Sciences. It also offers a comprehensive teacher’s training programme where students can combine a range of 26 subjects.\n\nGenerally, you can expect to pay 726.72 euros for an education here. You are also required to pay a student union fee of 20.20 euros.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Johannes Kepler Universität (@jkulinz)\n\n3. Johannes Kepler University Linz\n\nJohannes Kepler University Linz (JKU) — formerly known as the University of Social and Economic Sciences — is one of Austria’s younger universities. Situated in the third largest city in Austria, JKU sets itself apart by having all its teaching in one location.\n\nThe university is well-equipped with facilities that allow students to learn by doing. They can research new technologies at laboratories, workshops, medical or clinical research centres, or the LIT Factory too.\n\nLike the University of Vienna, you can expect to pay 747.92 euros for an education at JKU.\n\n4. Technische Universität Wien\n\nEager to pursue a career in technology or natural sciences at a university accredited by the QS World University Ranking 2023? Technische Universität Wien, commonly known as TU Wien, might be the place for you.\n\nAs a university conducting research, teaching and learning under the motto “Technology for people” for over 200 years, it ranked 179th in the recent QS World University Ranking. As such, the school is best known for its computer science, engineering, and natural science courses.\n\nDo note that all of the bachelor’s programmes at TU Wien are only delivered in German, so you have to prove sufficient knowledge of the language to be admitted into the degree programme. Fortunately, most of their master’s programmes are delivered in English.\n\nTuition and student union fees for non-EU or EEA nationals at TU Wien start at the same rate as the University of Vienna.",
    "Austria’s largest energy company given billions in state aid": "Austria’s largest energy company Wien Energie (WE) has run into massive payment difficulties due to high-risk speculative transactions. To prevent its collapse, the company was given 2 billion euros by the federal government within 72 hours. Before that, the owner, the city of Vienna, had already pumped €1.4 billion into WE. Altogether, the total need for financial support could run to six to eight billion euros, according to the company’s board of directors.\n\nAbout two million households in Vienna and the surrounding area are supplied with natural gas and electricity by WE. However, the company barely produces its own electricity, but buys and sells it on futures and spot markets. Fantastic profits can be realised on these markets, but they are also subject to strong fluctuations and are therefore risky. It is this that has put WE in an extreme financial situation.\n\nA year ago, a megawatt hour of electricity cost less than €90. In the meantime, the price has risen to around €1,000 euros. WE had speculated on falling prices and sold three times more energy than it could deliver. To be able to continue in business, securities running into billions of euros became necessary.\n\nWE is not an isolated case internationally. German energy trader Uniper has so far received €9 billion from the state-owned KfW Bank and applied for about two-thirds of the €34 billion that will be levied on natural gas customers from October via the gas surcharge. The company ran into trouble because gas deliveries from Russia failed to materialise and Uniper was forced to buy gas on the spot markets—where prices exploded—in order to fulfil its supply contracts.\n\nWien Energie is a wholly owned subsidiary of Wiener Stadtwerke, the infrastructure provider for the city and province of Vienna, and employs around 15,400. The present situation it confronts had been foreseeable for many months. Wien Energie attained a turnover of three billion euros in 2021. However, its annual surplus fell by 61 percent to only €140 million in the same period. In spring this year, the company declared that the future forecast was not “very happy”.\n\nThe falling profits were apparently to be made up for by engaging in speculative business deals. “Business was not normal,” the Süddeutsche Zeitung quotes energy market expert Walter Boltz. “I do think that the Viennese took a risk,” according to the ex-head of energy regulator E-Control.\n\nThe social democratic mayor of Vienna, Michael Ludwig, had given WE €700 million in July and again in August, using his emergency powers, without informing the public.\n\nLudwig and Stadtwerke deputy head Peter Weinelt have so far denied that the company was involved in risky speculative transactions. But the findings that have now come to light and the fact that WE strictly refuses to disclose its previous stock market strategy only lead to the opposite conclusion. An external expert as well as the municipal audit office are now to shed more light on the business practices.\n\nThe billions injected into the company by the federal government and the state have enabled it to continue its previous business dealings. WE said it was suspending the sale of electricity on the futures market “for the time being”, but that trading on the spot market would, of course, continue. Purchases and sales on the spot market are always made at the current daily price. No collateral is required here, but the risk of price fluctuations is enormous.\n\nMayor Ludwig played down the consequences of the lifeline using public money. The “most important thing” to him was the security of supply for the Viennese. There have been no consequences so far either for the WE management, nor the supervisory board, nor the Viennese provincial government.\n\nThe other political parties are demanding “full clarification” of the case and the resignation of Ludwig. Energy Minister Leonore Gewessler (Greens) now wants to have all energy suppliers investigated to obtain a “detailed picture of the sector”. Until 2020, the Greens themselves were part of the Viennese provincial government and should have been well informed about what was going on at WE. The Austrian chancellor’s party, the conservative ÖVP, is trying to exploit the case for its own benefit and has requested an investigation together with the far-right Austrian Freedom Party.\n\nAt the federal level, on the initiative of the Greens, the introduction of a gas surcharge based on the German model is being discussed. The surcharge is passed on to energy suppliers, who are thus compensated for increased import prices. In this way, the money ends up in the coffers of the big energy companies, which profit from it and report record returns.\n\nWhile the parties are arguing about the responsibility for the recent speculative losses, they all avoid the fundamental issue: namely, a basic social need, the supply of electric power, has become the subject of wild speculative transactions, with which, apart from occasional losses, gigantic profits are made at the expense of consumers.\n\nSince the European Union forced the opening up of electricity markets in 1998, which were previously strictly regulated and mostly in the hands of municipal suppliers, electricity has become a commodity on which producers, traders and grid operators earn massively.\n\nIn Germany, large customers, i.e., industrial companies and municipal utilities, only buy about half of their electricity directly from the producers. The other half is bought on the European Energy Exchange in Leipzig. There, some of the electricity is traded in the form of “futures”, with the price fixed up to six years in advance. The rest is bought on the spot market at daily or hourly prices, where the price of electricity tripled last month.\n\nThe so-called merit-order principle applies throughout the EU, according to which the price of the most expensive power plant still needed applies to all others, which secures them high profits. Originally, this was intended to promote the producers of renewable energy. But with the explosion of the gas price because of the Ukraine war, electricity prices have also skyrocketed, as expensive gas-fired power plants now determine the price.\n\nFor the producers of renewable, nuclear, and coal-fired electricity, this means exorbitant profits. For traders like Wien Energie, who have agreed long-term supply contracts at low prices, it can result in losses of billions. In all cases, the ones who suffer are the consumers, especially private households, and small businesses.\n\nWE customers have had to experience this in the past few days. On 1 September, WE’s prices rose sharply. According to Vienna magazine, customers were given the choice of switching to a new eco-electricity tariff, which is on average 25 percent more expensive, or remaining on the old tariff. However, this tariff will also become massively more expensive—even more than the new eco tariff. In the end, millions of households are faced with a 25 percent increase in their electricity costs.\n\nAccording to the Austrian Energy Agency, this month’s energy price index is up 9.2 percent compared to the previous month and 256 percent higher than in September 2021. In addition, there are also enormous increases in rental costs in Austria. According to consulting firm Deloitte, rents, not including utilities, in Linz and Graz rose by around 10 percent to over €10 per square metre. Rents in Vienna have also risen sharply recently. In large parts of the city, the price per square metre is already over €14.\n\nExperts assume that electricity prices in Europe will continue to rise in autumn and winter. Even the EU Commission’s promise to develop a new “electricity market design” will not change this. It will take months, if not years, for new regulations to come into force.",

Three people died between 2020 and 2022.\n\nIllnesses occurred in Vienna. The patients are five women and three men aged between 29 and 82 years old.\n\nThe outbreak strain has also been detected in a food product from the suspected company. This food was served in a restaurant mentioned when the sick people were interviewed.\n\nThe Ministry of Social Affairs, Health, Care and Consumer Protection (BMSGPK) had asked AGES to investigate the outbreak.\n\nAGES said local food authorities have taken “appropriate measures” to deal with the incident. These included temporarily stopping production at the site for steps including cleaning and disinfection ahead of a review before potential restart, according to local media.\n\nAbout Listeria infections\n\nFood contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes may not look or smell spoiled but can still cause serious and sometimes life-threatening infections. Anyone who has eaten any recalled product and developed symptoms of Listeria infection should seek medical treatment and tell their doctors about the possible Listeria exposure.\n\nAlso, anyone who has eaten any of the recalled products should monitor themselves for the food poisoning symptoms during the coming weeks because it can take up to 70 days after exposure to Listeria for symptoms of listeriosis to develop.\n\nSymptoms of Listeria infection can include vomiting, nausea, persistent fever, muscle aches, severe headache, and neck stiffness. Specific laboratory tests are required to diagnose Listeria infections, which can mimic other illnesses.\n\nPregnant women, the elderly, young children, and people such as cancer patients who have weakened immune systems are particularly at risk of serious illnesses, life-threatening infections, and other complications. Although infected pregnant women may experience only mild, flu-like symptoms, their infections can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn, or even stillbirth.\n\n(To sign up for a free subscription to Food Safety News, click here.)",

    "‘We just love proving people wrong!’ – Austria out to upset England’s Euro champions": "‘We just love proving people wrong!’ – Austria out to upset England’s Euro champions\n\nThe two face off in qualifying for the 2023 Women's World Cup, both having had successful summers at the Women's Euros\n\nWhen England last faced today's opponents Austria, the post-match atmosphere as players passed through to speak to the media, contrasted starkly with the result.\n\nIt was the opening game of a Euros campaign that would end with the Lionesses triumphing, winning their first ever major tournament in unforgettable fashion. But it started with a far from memorable 1-0 win against Austria, the occasion massive as 68,781 turned out at Old Trafford, but the performance stuttering as the unfavoured nation harried and pressured them like few others have done.\n\nThey almost spoiled the party, something they’ll look to do again this weekend to keep their unlikely hopes of finishing top of the World Cup qualifying group alive, while strengthening their ambitions for a seeded spot in the play-offs.\n\nUnderneath the headline of the summer as England brought football ‘home’, quarter-finalists Austria were one of the stories of the Euros. But they are not just a story for this year. The signs shown in July were as promising for the future as for that tournament. They’ll be a thorn in England’s side this weekend, and for any side moving forward.\n\nThat much was felt when Lionesses Lauren Hemp and Fran Kirby reflected on the game after these two last met. The mood was relief. They had got three points which would certainly, as what followed shows, get rid of the nerves that surrounded a much-hyped evening.\n\nWhen Austria midfielder Sarah Zadrazil stopped to talk, meanwhile, she was very pleased – or, in her words, “super happy”. Her team had lost the game, but there were plenty of positives in what was a “bonus game” against the favourites.\n\nWhat followed was a tournament not too many expected from Irene Fuhrmann’s side. They finished second in a group that saw Norway crash out in spectacular fashion, head coach Martin Sjogren leaving his role shortly after a group stage exit that included an 8-0 defeat to England, and posed Germany plenty of problems in the quarter-finals – hitting the woodwork three times before losing 2-0.\n\nAfter that game, Zadrazil was upbeat again, as was fellow midfielder Laura Feiersinger. Their team had just gone toe-to-toe with the eventual finalists, one of the world’s best.\n\n“We're always the underdog and no one really has us on the list,” Zadrazil told GOAL, after saying she believed Austria had “definitely” impressed a few in England. “We just love proving people wrong.\n\n“I think we showed, again, what being a team means and what you can achieve as a team. Maybe we don't have the best individual players out there, but I think we have a strong team and that's what matters and that's what's successful.”\n\nThe Bayern Munich star might be doing herself a disservice there, as she is one of the best midfielders in Europe. Austrian players might not grab the headlines, but added to Zadrazil’s quality, striker Nicole Billa is one of just two foreign players to be named Footballer of the Year in Germany – the other being Pernille Harder – while Arsenal’s Manuela Zinsberger was the stand-out goalkeeper in the Women’s Super League last season.\n\nHowever, team spirit and togetherness are certainly star characteristics of this national team.\n\n“We always have fun shortly before the games, which is, I think, very important because somehow you get waken up, you're there and you just enjoy everything,” Feiersinger explained.\n\n“From the moment we go outside, on the pitch, everything changes. That's so fascinating for me as well because sometimes I'm in the locker room and I'm like, 'Okay, we have a game in five minutes. We have the semi-finals or the quarter-finals and, it's insane in here'. But as soon as we step on the pitch, everything changes.”\n\nAll of that is headed up by Fuhrmann, one of the most impressive coaches at the Euros. To watch an Austria team is to watch 11 players who know exactly what the game plan is, what their role is and how to execute what is being asked of them.\n\n“I think tactically we are always well prepared against the opponents and that's one part, but she also lets us have our individual bits,” Zadrazil explained, giving a glowing review of a coach who only took charge last July. “She doesn't say, 'You have to play this way or this way'. We can be creative as well.\n\n“I think the best thing is that she keeps a good team spirit and that she keeps the team together and that everyone is happy and has a good feeling. I think that's what makes us so successful.”\n\n“We have young players, great young players,” Feiersinger added. “I think they need a few more years to develop and I think Irene is the perfect coach for them.”\n\nMany of those young stars got great exposure at the Euros – such as midfielder Marie-Therese Hobinger, winger Julia Hickelsberger-Fuller and recent Arsenal signing Laura Wienroither. Lisa Kolb and Maria Plattner, the two 21-year-olds who missed the Euros due to Covid and injury respectively, are right at the front of that exciting next generation, too.\n\n“It's very important,” Feiersinger replied, asked how crucial the summer’s experience would be going forward. “I think it's also so important for everyone that everyone starts believing that we are a great team, that we are great players and that everything is possible - especially for the future.\n\n“I think this tournament also showed that that we have quality and that we can be very proud of ourselves and that we won't stop.”\n\nEngland are unlikely to have forgotten how tough this team is to face – but a high-profile fixture like Saturday’s may serve as a reminder to many that Austria is a team to keep an eye on as yet another major tournament approaches over the horizon.",
    "Austria takes ‘historic step’ to scrap creeping tax rises": "Coalition partners have agreed that creeping tax increases on low-wage earners will be removed from the start of 2023\n\n‘Bracket creep’, or ‘cold progression’ as it is known in German, occurs when inflation pushes taxpayers into higher income tax brackets in progressive tax systems as wages increase to stay ahead of rising prices.\n\nThe result is an increase in income taxes but no increase in disposable income if adjustments to income tax rates are not made fast enough, a problem in places like Austria, where taxation levels do not automatically follow inflationary pressures.\n\n“The abolition of the creeping tax increase is a historic step. With this, we ensure that a salary increase actually remains for all those who work hard every day to live on and is not eaten up by moving up to a higher tax bracket,” Chancellor Karl Nehammer said on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to calculations by the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO) and the Institute for Advanced Studies (IHS), the creeping tax increase is worth €1.85 billion.\n\nFrom 1 January 2023, two-thirds of the revenue will flow back to taxpayers automatically in the future via income tax and deductions. The remaining third of about €600 million benefits those on low and medium incomes, for example, through relief measures.\n\nThe government’s plans include raising the marginal amounts of the lowest two pay scales above the inflation rate. According to the think tank Agenda Austria, however, the government “could have had more courage”.\n\nSocial and family benefits are also to be adjusted in line with inflation starting next year.\n\n“Together with the short-term benefits such as inflation compensation, climate bonus and electricity price cap, this results in a comprehensive package of short-term and long-term measures,” said Social Minister Johannes Rauch.\n\n(Laura Kabelka | EURACTIV.de)",
    "Cli­mate change threat­ens ice caves in Aus­tria": "There are several thousand documented ice caves worldwide, and Austria is one of the countries with the highest density of ice caves -- but only a few have been studied in detail. Over the past few years, a team of researchers from the Universities of Innsbruck and Belfast has now analysed in detail eight ice caves with a descending morphology in Tyrol, Styria, Upper Austria and Carinthia, choosing a comparative research approach. \"There are already some good studies on single ice caves. However, this was the first time a comparative analysis was carried out and we focused on the ice development in several caves that are also in comparable settings: similar altitude and a steep to vertically sloping geometry,\" explains Tanguy Racine from the Quaternary Research Group around Christoph Spötl at the Department of Geology. His dissertation dealt with the topic in detail. Ice bodies in these caves are formed from solid precipitation: snow falls and slides into the cave in winter and then subsequently turns to ice at low temperatures.\n\nCharlotte Honiat and Tanguy Racine from the Department of Geology pack ice samples in the Tyrolean Guffert Eisschacht for further analysis in the laboratory.\n\nSimilar development of ice caves and glaciers\n\nUsing the radiocarbon method, the team determined the age of the ice layers in the caves, which are often many metres thick: \"To date the ice, we focused on the tiniest inclusions of wood in the ice layers. The age of these wood fragments, which fell into the caves from the outside, can be determined precisely,\" Tanguy Racine explains the procedure. The large database of a total of 107 dates of wood inclusions from the ice draws an accurate picture of the increase and decrease of ice in the ice caves -- the so-called mass balance -- and this over a period of up to 2000 years in the past. This approach enabled the team to prove the hypothesis that historically documented glacier advances, such as during the \"Little Ice Age,\" are also represented in the increase in ice mass in ice caves and coincide in time. \" We can document comparable ups and downs in the development of ice in ice caves and glaciers for the period of the last two millennia. For both, it is essential how much snow falls in winter and how warm the summers are. The results also show us that a large part of the underground ice in Austria originates from the \"Little Ice Age\" between about the 15th and 19th centuries,\" says the geologist.\n\nMassive declines in the last decades\n\nIn the recent past, the balance of ice caves is clearly negative: \"Glaciers are not alone in showing an above-average negative mass balance especially in the last decades. Ice caves have also been severely affected by the consequences of rising temperatures and declining precipitation,\" says Tanguy Racine. \"We are seeing a rate of ice retreat that has not been observed in any period in our measurement period over the last 2000 years. To give a few examples: Monitoring in the Guffert Eisschacht in Steinberg am Rofan showed a decline of almost three metres in the snow surface between 2019 and 2021, while Eisgruben Eishöhle at Sarstein in Upper Austria has lost 10 metres of ice thickness within 40 years. The ice loss in Kraterschacht in the Sengsen Mountains of Upper Austria is 20 metres in 20 years.\" The explanation for this development, analogous to the glaciers, is human-induced climate change. \"Especially for the medium-sized and smaller ice caves, we have to assume that they will massively lose ice mass or even become completely ice-free in the next few years to decades,\" Racine clarifies. \"The clock is ticking loudly.\"\n\nThe Innsbruck researchers plan to selectively take ice cores from alpine ice caves in the coming years and store them cooled in order to preserve the valuable climate information for science in the long term.\n\nThe studied Austrian caves are: Tyrol: Hundsalm Eis- und Tropfsteinhöhle; Guffert Eisschacht Styria: Bärenloch Eishöhle; Tremml-Schacht Upper Austria: Eisgruben Eishöhle; Kraterschacht; Hochschneid Eishöhles Carinthia: Großer Naturschacht",
    "An Unlikely Saint for Our Times: Blessed Karl of Austria": "\n\nInterview Transcript\n\nAn upcoming symposium in Dallas, Texas will look at the life of Blessed Karl of Austria, the last Habsburg Emperor who was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 2004. What can we learn from this man?\n\nLinks:\n\n• Blessed Emperor Karl Symposium\n\n• Blessed Karl of Austria website\n\n• Blessed Charles of Austria: A Holy Emperor and His Legacy (book)\n\nWatch on Odysee:\n\n\n\nWatch on YouTube:\n\n\n\nTranscript:\n\nEric Sammons:\n\nAn upcoming symposium in Dallas, Texas, will look at the life of Blessed Karl of Austria, the last Habsburg Emperor, and who was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 2004. What can we learn from this man today? That’s what we’re going to talk about on Crisis Point today.\n\nHello, I’m Eric Sammons, your host, and the Editor-in-Chief of Crisis Magazine. Before we get started, I just want to encourage people to subscribe to the channel, to like this episode, let other people know about it, and follow us on social media @CrisisMag.\n\nSo our guest today has had a devotion to Blessed Karl for about five years now. His name is David Ross, and he is the host of the Blessed Karl Symposium to be held this year on October 15th in Dallas, Texas. And we’ll talk more about the symposium in a little bit, but I want to first start talking about Blessed Karl himself, and people might notice who follow this podcast, that I recently had a change in my background.\n\nAnd, in fact, the change was that I have a Blessed Karl bust behind me now. So you can tell I have an interest in this subject as well. Now I want to start by saying, it might seem odd to modern Americans that there’s a growing veneration, or growing devotion to this man. After all, he was a leader of a country we were at war with in WWI. He was a Monarch and we’re in America, we’re very much for democracy. And also, by our standards, he was a failure, in the sense that he wanted to bring about peace, he wasn’t able to do that. And so it seems like a strange person for modern Americans who loved success, we love democracy, definitely on our side in every war. Why do you think there is a growing devotion, just in a nutshell, why do you think there’s a growing devotion to this man?\n\nDavid Ross:\n\nWell, good morning, Eric. Thank you so much for having me on the show. It’s an honor to be with you. I think the answer is this, it’s really what is going on today in our country. In Blessed Karl’s time, and you’re talking about a young man who was the emperor of a vast empire, when there were forces against him… anti-Catholic bigots, communists, Masons, modernists, everybody working to destroy his empire, which is a very Catholic empire, and replacing these good institutions with intrinsically evil ones. And does that not sound like today? So when I would read about Blessed Karl, I thought this is so applicable. It’s so relevant today. How did he navigate through it? And what was so remarkable is that he always stayed on mission. He didn’t lose the faith. He was a very temperate man. He couldn’t be beguiled by luxury. He was not a stranger to pain and difficulty. He was the perfect man for the job, but he was rather outnumbered and overwhelmed, but he kept his joy the whole time.\n\nAnd joy… the devil wants to take our joy away, which is that choice of an inner gladness of heart, and the devil’s after that, because he’s taken so much away from us, but not everything. There’s every reason for hope. And so I found it very interesting. How did this man stay on mission? And he so stayed on mission, and keep his joy, and his faith when his empire, which was hundreds of years old, came collapsing down around him. And so when I read about him, I’m pulled into his story and I smile, because the devil isn’t going to take away our joy. And especially after men, he is… and a prime example for men, for fathers, husbands, and leaders, how he guided his family and the other provinces, which made up the empire, and he did it with a smile and he would not have his joy taken away. And I find it very, very inspiring and very relevant for today.\n\nEric Sammons:\n\nIt was interesting in Crisis Magazine, just this week, we had article by Father Robert McTeigue about comparing the… he calls it the Guns of August. He’s comparing August 1914 with August 2022. And he actually was making the parallel between the two times. And he particularly mentioned Blessed Karl. And he said, we don’t have a Blessed Karl today. So the one good thing they had back then we actually don’t even have that. So it was somewhat of a sobering read. But I do think there’s a lot of, like you were saying, a lot of connections on similarities between the two times. Now, let’s take a step back for a second. And I just want to briefly, let’s talk about a little bit about the Habsburgs, because he is the last Habsburg Emperor. There’s obviously still Habsburgs alive today, but that name has a certain mystique and also a certain… I think there’s a certain bias against it. And with Americans, can you speak just briefly about the family and kind of what it means in connection with Catholicism and in the life of Blessed Karl?\n\nDavid Ross:\n\nYes, I can touch on that. The Habsburgs originated from, today what is North Switzerland. And they succeeded the governance of the Holy Roman Empire, which started on Christmas Day in the year 800 when Pope Leo III crowned Karl der Grosse, Karl the Great, Karles Magnos. And the last Emperor is Karl… our man, Blessed Karl. And so the Habsburgs started to rule this empire in the late 13th century, 1270, something like that. And well, this predates Protestantism. So this was all Catholics, or countries which were soon to be converting to the faith, but perhaps most of them already were. And so this is the only Christian faith at the time, the Apostolic Church. And so monarchy was the normal mode for governance of these territories. And the borders changed throughout the years. I mean, for one time, well, if you’re including the Holy Roman Empire, almost the entirety of Europe, not all of it, that came to an end in the early 1800s.\n\nAnd then what took its place, and the Habsburgs were still on the throne, was the Austrian Empire, which went into 1867 when it merged with the Kingdom of Hungary. And Kingdom of Hungary was a very large kingdom itself. It ruled for hundreds of years, and this is what’s called the dual monarchy. And that started in… that merger, if you will, took place in 1867, and this is commonly referred to as the Austro-Hungarian Empire. And so the Hapsburgs, not all of them, were beautifully Catholic people. Some were rather shameful to the faith. Some were very superb to the faith… just like then, just like now. But what’s interesting is that, the longest reigning Kaiser… Kaiser’s German for emperor, was Franz Joseph, who reigned for almost 70 years until he died in 1916. His successor was supposed to be his nephew, Franz Ferdinand. Franz Ferdinand was a devout Catholic, and Franz Joseph was too, but Franz Ferdinand also was, and he was next in line and he was assassinated in 1914.\n\nAnd that is why, a month later… that was June 28, 1914, and it triggered WWI July 28th, one month later, 1914, WWI, and we’ll talk about that, because I know right now you’re not asking me about that, but I have a lot to say about that. And so when the old Kaiser died well into his eighties in 1916, Blessed Karl took over. He was always a very devout Catholic man, a boy. In fact, when he was about five years old, there was very little chance he was ever going to come to the throne because there was at least five men, depending on how you calculate it, in line before him and their male offspring.\n\nSo it made a Hungarian nuns’ prophecy that he was going to be Emperor one day, so laughable, so far fetched, but she said, “I assure you, he is going to be Emperor, and he’s going to be persecuted. And the gates of hell are going to be tormenting him. So we need to pray for him”. So she started the Gebetsliga, in German, the Prayer League, which still goes on today. And the head of the North American branch of it is actually one of our speakers. So I answered a little bit more than what you asked.\n\nEric Sammons:\n\nThat’s okay. Yeah. Well, it’s easy to get excited about Blessed Karl and just keep on going. I know how that is. So let’s talk… so he’s basically the inheritor, of course, of the Holy Roman Empire. But at the time that he became Emperor, it’s the Austro-Hungarian Empire, but let’s talk a little bit about his upbringing. So now, obviously we know that that Blessed Karl was a devout Catholic, but was he raised from birth as a devout Catholic? Was his family, his parents, were they devout Catholics? What was his upbringing like?\n\nDavid Ross:\n\nYes. His upbringing was thoroughly Catholic. The Habsburg family were absolutely Catholic. His mother was very devout. His father had some rough edges around it. He seemed to have fallen more under the wing of his mother, but he also had tutors and he had a very academically rich upbringing. He went to institutional schools, as well as private tutoring. And he was known for always being, even as a boy, very merciful, very virtuous, always serving others.\n\nFor instance, there’s one story about after he and Zita married, October 21, 1911… see, that’s his feast day. He died in April 1st, which normally is a Saint’s feast day. But Pope St. John Paul II, who is named after Karl… remember that Pope’s name is Charles, Karol, named after Karl actually, picked the date of their marriage to be his feast day. Well, soon after they married, he and his young bride, Zita, were assigned to go live somewhere else in the empire because he was in the military, and he had to go to his post.\n\nOn the way there, their car breaks down in front of a house, and the lady comes out and recognizes his military uniform and said, “You’re in my son’s unit”. “Yes, I am”. She doesn’t recognize who he is. “Would you take something for him”? “Be happy to.” “Here’s a little bit of bread and some money.” “Gladly”. So he drove without ever telling the woman who he was. He drove to his unit, looked up her son, and gave him the bread with the money, and he put more money into it. And didn’t tell the woman. But the son reached back to his mother and said, “You’ll never know who that was”. That is so Karl.\n\nThere’s other examples. For instance, when he was Emperor, he ordered the royal carriages to load up with vessels of milk, to hand deliver to the hungry children during WWI, to give them milk. He ordered that everybody put on rations during the war. He included his own palatial staff, even himself. They all had to eat the same amount of food of what the soldiers were, out in war, very meager food offerings. This explains… I gave some when he was younger and then older, this explains how he was. There’s even a gardener who tended the palace gardens, who remembered him as a boy, how he was always trying to give money and do services for the servants. That’s him. So it’s really no surprise. And if you read all the books that I got a hold of, all about Karl, you can see, it’s no wonder that he is a Saint. I mean, he really always was.\n\nEric Sammons:\n\nYeah. And I think we need to realize… of course, it’s very difficult for every one of us to be humble. I mean, that’s our… pride is the base sin of all of us, and it’s very hard to be humble, but to try to imagine growing up as Karl did, even though he was maybe fifth or something in line at first, I mean, it’s equivalent to somebody like Prince Harry in the British royal family. And then, of course, he ends up becoming kind of Prince William as far as his status. And think about growing up like that, where you are in this situation where you’re kind of above everybody, is the natural thing. A lot of us might then tend to revel in that, and become very prideful about that. And I think… and you see, of course, in the history of royal families marks a lot of the bad ones, that’s exactly what they do.\n\nSo I think it’s very telling that Karl, from a very young age, he never let that become something, a point of pride for him, but it was more of a point of service for him. And I love the story about him going off with, running an errand for someone. That’s great. But I also want to bring up then, part of his upbringing then, it was as a soldier. And so what was his military service, because sometimes you get situations where somebody in a royal family, they kind of have almost just a… it’s a more perfunctory service. But I believe, if I’m not mistaken, Blessed Karl actually did have a lot more than that. He was actually intimately involved as a soldier. Am I right?\n\nDavid Ross:\n\nYes. Yes. That was his job. If I can simplify it that way. He was a military man, and that was his constant work. And if you go online and see lots of pictures of Blessed Karl, you’ll see many of them in soldiers uniforms, with the troops. He was known, even while he was Emperor for two precious years, he was Emperor, it’s fascinating. All this talk. We’re still here talking about Blessed Karl who was on the throne for two years, but we’re no longer talking about all these forces at that day, who were much bigger than him in a way, at least influentially. No symposiums about him. No symposiums about the anti-Catholic president Woodrow Wilson. And this is 100 years later, but Blessed Karl… Karl would visit the troops, while Emperor, literally in the trenches, visiting them, bringing them food, bringing them good cheer. And he spent his whole time on the throne, those precious two years, working for an end to the war. He was against the war.\n\nIf I can just add this, because people might say, you know what started the war? If they’re so good, then why is there a war? Well, the heir to the throne was assassinated. The Kaiser’s nephew was murdered in cold blood at point blank range. He and his wife, Franz Ferdinand and Sophie, in Sarajevo, Bosnia. And that’s a whole other talk, but they were assassinated by people that already were troublemakers for the empire, the Serbians. And so Austria gave Serbia a list of requirements they had to do, okay? You have to do this, that, this or that, or we’re going to invade. And they agreed to almost all of them, but the Kaiser was old and frail and his generals muscle him into launching excursions into Serbia proper. And that’s what started it.\n\nSo Austria invaded Serbia, which was allied to Russia. So Russia invaded Austria. Germany was allied to Austria. So Germany invaded Russia, and Germany sent a note to both France and Russia. France, you must declare your neutrality in this problem with Russia, and Russia, you must stand down. Well, they didn’t get an answer at all. So Germany attacked France through Belgium. Well, England, which wasn’t particularly allied with Serbia or with Russia, but was with Belgium, and attacked Germany. And that is WWI. Italy was actually allied with Austria, but England and France promised Italy, if they would join England and France, the entente, that they would get a chunk, a free real estate deal. They’d get a chunk of Austria, which they now have. It’s Sud Tyrol, in the far north. And so Italy went against Austria, and then ironically.\n\nSo Karl spent his time, instead of prosecuting the war, offering peace. Pope Benedict, at the time, gave him a peace plan, offered peace, but it was rejected because they saw that as a weakness, and they thought we could crush this man, and get his lands rather than take his offer of peace. And that caused the death of a million more men and Woodrow Wilson deliberately would not talk to Karl. He would only speak to the agitators in the different empires, the Austrians, the Hungarians, the Czechs, the Polish, the dissidents who were exiled elsewhere, which actually helped crumble the empire because he wouldn’t… in other words, Wilson already rejected the legitimacy of this 650 year old empire. And all of this is during Fatima, 1917. Keep in mind, when our lady told the children pray for peace… this is in context of WWI, and ironically Blessed Karl ended up, and his remains still are, on the Portuguese island of Madeira. Again, a little more than what you asked for.\n\nEric Sammons:\n\nOh, that’s all good. That’s all good. So why don’t you give me… so just to make sure we recap here. So WWI has started before Blessed Karl is the Emperor. And like you said, it was basically a domino effect. One thing led to another led to another. Now all of a sudden we have all of Europe is it war, and eventually United States also enters into it. And it really was the war to end all wars, as it was called, and it was just a horrible thing. And can I tell by your tone of voice, you share the same opinion as me about Woodrow Wilson. I wish Americans realize he probably ranks as the worst American president ever. And I’m not going to get on a whole tangent against him, because I could, but just terrible in so many ways. It’s unbelievably. But let’s talk about Blessed Karl though, who’s the good leader back then.\n\nSo he becomes Emperor in the midst of WWI. It’s not like, all of a sudden, that he can just day one say, okay, we’re out of it now. That’s not how it works because he has his alliances with Germany. And it’s just not something that can be done. However, from day one, from the moment he became Emperor, he said his goal was peace. His goal was to end the conflict. What were some of the practical things that Blessed Karl tried to do during the war to bring peace about?\n\nDavid Ross:\n\nAnd it was hard, because his ally, who was much stronger than him, was the German Empire, and the German Empire was not a very old empire. It’s just another long history about the Holy Roman Empire, then the German Confederation. But it was a big empire and Kaiser Wilhelm II, was very powerful and his generals were very powerful, and the growth of the Austrian empire was due to marriage, actually not to war. And so I just don’t really think the Austrians were very skilled at war making. But every time Blessed Karl… and he had to confer with the German Kaiser because they were literally enmeshed. I mean, their soldiers were mixed, literally side by side in the trenches. So he couldn’t just pull them out. That was one thought, why don’t we just tell all the Austrians to come home? We’re just going to stop.\n\nWell, they were in the trenches with the Germans, side by side, because they’re both speaking German. Also, it was feared, and not unreasonably, that Germany would just take over the Austro-Hungarian Empire itself. It was a strange bedfellow for Austria. So Karl continually sent messages and met with the Kaiser Wilhelm in Germany… “Let’s end this”. “No, my generals are telling me we can win this”. “I don’t think so. Let’s end this now. Plus men are dying, and for what? Let’s end this”. Well, he wouldn’t. So it was hard for… and it took me some time on just all the different books I’ve read, to get my mind around this, why he couldn’t just stop. And it took several books and a couple of readings to understand, it wasn’t that easy, because their troops were so intertwined with the German troops and their fear that Germany would take over Austria and Germany’s refusal. So that was the main reason why he couldn’t just arbitrarily sue for a separate peace, as they call it.\n\nNow the biggest, most reported effort that Blessed Karl made, was a separate peace that he offered to France and England. He finally did reach a point where he was willing to make a separate peace outside of Germany, but he kept it a secret from Germany and some of the French, some of the English agreed with it, but some didn’t. And when the Germans found out, it really blew up and it made Karl look bad. Let me just say now Karl was not a great warrior. Never said he was.\n\nAnd a study of Karl looks like a study of Christ, and it just takes my breath away at how relevant it is today. And we’re not going to be able to cover it. The symposium website, by the way, in case someone’s waiting now is, blessedkarl.org… Karl with a K, org, not com. Blessedkarl.org. So Karl kept doing this. He kept contacting the Italians. Let’s stop the French. Let’s stop the English. Let’s stop… not the Russians, because Russia attacking… now consider this, Russia attacking Austria, back in July, August of ’14 at the very beginning, it’s really what started WWI. When Austria went into Serbia, which now we say we wish they didn’t, but when they did that, that wasn’t WWI. It’s when Russia attacked Austria. Ironically, within a year, couple years, three years, the Russians are out of the war, because the Bolsheviks took over, and Lenin was in hibernation, in Switzerland, and he wanted to go into Austria, and Karl would not allow him to use the Austrian railway because he knew what the communists would bring to the world.\n\nYou talk about prophecy, a prophetic vision. It was the Germans who let Lenin in, to Russia, through Germany, because they thought it would be good to destabilize the Russians. Well it did. Oh brother did it. And now for 100 of years, these 100s of years, this 100 years, this moral mess that the world is in, historians believe it’s because of the fall of the Habsburg Empire. Some say, because this man did not stay on the throne, it was the dam that kept it all in. When he was removed, it all burst. And because people say, how did we get into this? Most historians believe that the end of WWI, was that line drawn in the sand. The dam bursting.\n\nSo that’s… but the empires that he was warring with… which is ironic, because some of them were relatives, because these Royal houses intermarried. They were all friends of his. Anytime there was a Royal wedding or a funeral, the Kaiser would send Karl because he was so lovable. So the irony is that he was in charge of fighting these people. Well they just continued to refuse his offers of peace. And because they thought, why take peace and end the war, when we can take his country and end the war? So, that’s the medium answer to your question?\n\nEric Sammons:\n\nOkay. So now let’s get to the fact that the end of the empire, the end of him being Emperor… now he did not abdicate. I know that. So how did it happen? Why did it happen? Why did he have to leave leadership of the Austro-Hungarian Empire?\n\nDavid Ross:\n\nWhy did he have to leave? Is that what you said?\n\nEric Sammons:\n\nYes.\n\nDavid Ross:\n\nOkay. Well, eventually the war did come to an end, and the Masons, communists, anti-Catholics, socialists, took over. They organized a takeover because the empire was comprised of Austria, Hungary and Croatia and Slovenia and Bosnia, Herzegovina, and part of Ukraine and Poland and the like. Well, inside of all of these… I don’t know any country where everybody agrees 100% with their leader, right? I mean, I don’t know any human in the world who’s perfect today. So there were factions, there were always malcontents, and they approached England, France, and the United States, and said help us set up a new government. So that’s what I’m saying. Woodrow Wilson, awful man, horrible man, he would only meet with them, to further destabilize the empire.\n\nSo they got what they wanted. The war is finished. Kaiser Wilhelm abdicated, and took, today what would be hundreds of millions of dollars worth of wealth, and scrammed. Blessed Karl didn’t, because he was a devout Catholic. And while the throne of Austria did not require a kind of vow to God, the coronation of the Kingdom of Hungary did. The coronation of the king of Hungary did. And so it was rather liturgical. The bishops were there. It was in the cathedral, and he had vestments on, and he made a promise to God. I will not abandon my people. And a good father does not abandon his people, his children. A good father does not frighten his children. A good father does not let his children go scattered. Where is Papa? Where is Papa? He stays. And he defends. So he made a promise to God, and a father does not abandon his children. So Karl never could. And mind you, the context of this is, the Romanov family in Russia, who had just been assassinated a year before, knowing that could happen, he still would not abdicate.\n\nToday, maniacs are still obsessed with the idea. People who don’t even care about this issue, they still want to pursue the claim that he abdicated, to show that he renounced God and his children, but he didn’t. 100 years, they’ve been trying to manufacture evidence that he did. And he didn’t. Because a lot of people say, what does it matter? It matters because Blessed Karl lived as an Emperor and a Catholic. Even on his deathbed, he called his son, the Crown Prince Otto, and he wouldn’t let the children come to him, because he was afraid they would get a disease, and you need to see how an emperor and a Catholic dies. This man was through and through Catholic. And that’s why I say he’s so relevant to men today. You men can learn from Karl, how he navigated life through such trials and tribulations and humiliations and calumny, how he guides his family, how he guides his responsibilities, how he doesn’t abandon his duties.\n\nAnd that’s why I keep saying he is so relevant today. So the communists wanted him to do that because he was so popular. They knew that most of the people were behind him, but the powerful people weren’t, okay? So they wanted him to abdicate because it would be so quick and simple, but he wouldn’t, because they were afraid a civil war. If the people would have what they wanted, they would pick Karl and it might lead to civil war. And then the communists, the Masons, the anti-Catholic bigots and radical Republicans and rugged individualists, they would lose it away. And so that’s why they needed him to abdicate, but he didn’t. And wouldn’t because of the reason I said.\n\nEric Sammons:\n\nNow, what was it… so after he left office, I guess we’ll say, after… he didn’t really leave office. After he left the country, I guess, is a better way to put it, and he stopped ruling the country, his life was actually very short after that. But tell me a little bit about then what was his life like before, and leading up to his death after he had left running the empire?\n\nDavid Ross:\n\nYes. Yes. Yes. And let me just insert this. I try not to make this a regurgitation of all the ills he went through, and then a regurgitation of all the ills we are going through. My point is, times are tough now. Let’s not pretend that isn’t so. They are tough now, but there is a victory to be had, in looking at the saints and that’s what the saints are for. They can help us get to Jesus. Blessed Karl’s life helps me, and a lot of other men, get to Jesus. Read about it, and find out, come to the symposium, etcetera, but read about it and find out. And that’s why the veneration of this Saint certainly isn’t the end. It’s a means to the end, which is Jesus in heaven.\n\nSo, he was exiled to Switzerland. I mean, he’s actually holed up in a castle. There are attempts on his life, together with a request for abdication, which he wouldn’t. Finally, the British sent a Catholic German and… the British sent a British Catholic general, rather, to take him and escort him to Switzerland. So he went to Switzerland with his family, and that is, I believe, ’19. The war ended in ’18, and this is ’19. Out of Switzerland, and before this happened, he put a Naval Commander… Austria today doesn’t have any Navy. They don’t… they’re not, have any seas, seashore, but back then they did. He put a man on the throne in Hungary. Remember Karl is Emperor of Austria, King of Hungary. He put that man as a Regent, hold my place, coming back. He’s exiled into Switzerland and goes back to Hungary, unannounced, to tell the Regent, “I’m here”. “What are you here for”? “I’m here to take over again”. “Not now. Now’s on a good time. You need to come back another time”. And it was just awful.\n\nKarl had heart attacks. He had trouble in planning. And so he left. He didn’t even have a weapon with him. He went back to Switzerland. A few months later, he made another incursion into Hungary, this time by airplane, for the first time in his life, he’s on an airplane with Zita. He tried to take the throne again, but the Regent would not let him. And Karl could see a civil war. This was a very short, abbreviated version. He could see a civil war was going to happen, though most Hungarians supported him, the people in power didn’t. So the British… Switzerland would never receive him again. So the British first shipped him to… they put him on a ship, and they couldn’t get anybody to captain the ship because they were all Karlists here, Blessed Karl. They try to get a Croatian to do it, but they were so loyal to it. So they found a Serb, who were historically against the Empire.\n\nThey first shipped into Constantinople and Turkey, and then shipped him 2000 miles away to the Portuguese island of Madeira, which was more off of the coast of Western Africa than it is Europe. And he arrived in November of ’21, and three and a half months later, without seeing his children, he finally were given his children who were still in Switzerland. He got his children, and Zita, went to Switzerland on February 3rd, brought them back and arrived in Madeira on February 3rd. And Blessed Karl died April 1st, 1922.\n\nWhat happened is, a few things. First, you’ve got the Spanish flu, sorry, the Iberian peninsula norality. Yeah, you get it. And did he maybe get some of that? But he was high in a mountain, which was always in clouds and a very cold house with no heat, no electricity. And he caught a cold, shivers. Maybe the Spanish flu, certainly a broken heart. His granddaughter Princess Maria-Anna, one of our speakers, said that her grandmother, the Empress, said he died of a broken heart. I mean, if you read about all the things he went through, that’s why I say, wow, this is like a modern day life of Christ, all those things, it killed him literally.\n\nAnd so he died on April 1, 1922 at 12:25 PM, at the age of 34, almost 35, with a few last words on his lips, if I can tell you. First he’s receiving communion daily, he’s going to confession multiple times. He declares again, “I did not abdicate. I would never abandon my people, but God wants me to lay down my life for my people”. Who does that sound like? Then he calls in Otto, as I said, his first born son of eight children, and actually was the last one to die about 10 years ago or so, almost 100 years old, “Come and see how a Catholic and an Emperor dies”.\n\nThen he says to his wife, “Let my peoples know, I forgive them all”. And he had much to not forgive and much to forgive. And he did. And then he said to his wife, “Why can’t we go home”? He starts to hallucinate and “Why can’t they just let us go home”? Then he looks at his wife and says, “I will love you endlessly”. And then he looks at the crucifix and says, “Jesus”, and dies at the age of 34, leaving seven children and a pregnant wife, while the socialists and Austria make a law, called the Habsburgs Law.\n\nHabsburgs are not allowed to go back to Austria. They’re not allowed to set foot in Austria. After they’ve been running the country for 650 years. And so they all spread out in different countries. For instance, you’ll see this picture of, on February 3rd, when Zita comes back from Switzerland, bringing the children, that he hasn’t seen in three and a half months, he’s holding a little boy. That’s two year old Rudolph, who is the father of our speaker, Princess Maria-Anna von Habsburg- Galitzine, who lives in Texas by the way, that is her father. When he grew up and become a man, he moved to New York and fell in love with a Russian Countess who was Orthodox.\n\nYou had to go through special tricks and maneuvers to marry a non-Catholic. And so the Catholic Rudolph, married Countess Xenia, and who married them was an obscure priest… you might know him by the name of Fulton Sheen.\n\nEric Sammons:\n\nThat’s amazing. So they scattered all over. And I just want to finish before we talk about the symposium. So Empress Zita, she lived for quite some time after that. And you mentioned how the Habsburgs were not allowed back in Austria, but Empress Zita did come back, right? 1989 was her funeral… wasn’t it in Austria? Did she go back there?\n\nDavid Ross:\n\nYes. They allowed her. She died well in her nineties. She died in 1989 and her funeral was… she was allowed to eventually go back. The Crown Princes Otto was allowed to go back. They wanted him to sign an abdication form, but he wouldn’t, but he did sign a form saying that he has no intention of running the government or something like that. I don’t know. I don’t know everything about Blessed Karl, but he was allowed to go back. And when his mother died, Servant of God, Zita, her funeral was in Vienna Austria, only if her family pays for it, the government is not paying one shilling, penny for it. So they all had to pay for it.\n\nAnd there was eight children. Otto was one of them. I mentioned Rudolph, there’s six more children. They scattered, some are in Hungary. The great, great, great grandson of the old Kaiser, Franz Joseph, who died in 1916, he’s one of our speakers. He’s a guy, my age. He is Hungary’s Ambassador to the Holy See, believe it or not. He’s a husband, a family man. They have six children. He’s one of our speakers. He is Edward from Habsburg, and his talk, he is going to talk about, in context of Blessed Karl, how do you live in a world like today? And he’s a diplomat and he’s a dad and a father and all those children, how does he do it? So he is going to have a unique and interesting way of intertwining those two, Blessed Karl-ism and 22- ism. And what does that look like?\n\nBut our speakers and study about Karl, there’s joy there. As Bishop Sheen says, there’s no better time to be Catholic. And the harder the time is, there’s no better time to be Catholic. This is really when we can show, how a Catholic lives and how he dies, and how he faces these challenges and how he will not allow himself to be intimidated to deny his faith. There never was a time in recent memory and generations to apply Blessed Karl to the times. And this is now. Again, it’s more than what you asked, but I’m so filled with joy about it.\n\nEric Sammons:\n\nYes. And this is great. This is the enthusiasm is showing. I like it. And so you’ve mentioned two of the speakers. They’re going to be there. Who are the other speakers are going to be at the symposium?\n\nDavid Ross:\n\nWell, one is, I mentioned the Archduke Ambassador at Edouard von Hapsburg. I mentioned Suzanne Pearson.\n\nEric Sammons:\n\nYou mentioned the granddaughter, also.\n\nDavid Ross:\n\nOkay. So Princess Maria-Anna, yes, the granddaughter, she’ll be there. She’s not giving a speech or a talk, but I will interview her. She even lived with her grandmother, Zita. We have an amazing interview and some people report to me that it’s their favorite part of it, but it’s playful. It’s historical. It’s interesting. She can talk about what it was like living with Zita, her grandmother, and give us some answers, which are not in books, from just living with the venerable lady. Suzanne Pearson, and she is at, emperorcharles.org. She is the delegate of the North American Emperor Charles Prayer League, that that Hungarian nun I talked about, started in 1892, that’s still going on. She’s one of our speakers, expert in all things Karl.\n\nWe have a well known and prolific American author by the name of Charles Coulombe. That’s spelled C-O-U-L-O-M-B-E. He is a very interesting man and author in that, he’s written many historical books, many books on history, and history that you’ve never heard before. For instance, one on American history called Puritan’s Empire. Well, he’s written a book about Blessed Karl. He’s right now, living in Vienna, working on another doctorate degree. That’s it, brother.\n\nEric Sammons:\n\nI got it right here.\n\nDavid Ross:\n\nI don’t even have to find it for you.\n\nEric Sammons:\n\nCharles is actually one of the contributing editors of Crisis Magazine. We had him on a few weeks ago on the podcast.\n\nDavid Ross:\n\nYes. Yes. I’m not surprised to hear that. He’s sought after. He offers an interesting dimensional insight to the subject matter that you just don’t get from everybody. And he’s in Austria doing deep, intense research, on the Habsburgs, and what was going on. He’s working on a book now about, Servant of God, Empress and Queen Zita, Crown Prince Otto. He is one of our speakers. We’re so fortunate to get him because he almost couldn’t come when he thought I wanted to bring him on Blessed Karl’s feast day, which is October 21st. And the event isn’t… the event is a week before, about a week before, October 15th. So lastly, and certainly not lastly, is Bishop Athanasius Schneider. I’m sure 101% of your viewers knows who he is. He has a bold pastor. He is coming as a spiritual director to speak a little bit about Blessed Karl, but also give us some reasons for hope that Christ Wins. You have that new book of his from a couple years ago, Christus Vincit?\n\nEric Sammons:\n\nThat’s right. Yes I do. It’s sitting right over there in the bookshelf.\n\nDavid Ross:\n\nOkay. I’ll take your word for it. So that man has seen it all. He is intimately deep into the world. He has a tough life, too. And what’s interesting about these speakers is, these are people that have suffered, and you usually have more to learn from people who have suffered, but they’re not going to be at our symposium to offend the moral sensibilities of children. I’ve told my speakers, please don’t… we don’t want to hear a regurgitation of all the ills. We already know it. Our speakers are going to come to give you reasons for joy, to smile. The devil wants you to be nervous. He wants you to be glued to the news. He wants you to be obsessed with it. He wants you to be depressed, and he wants you to lose your faith and joy. And we’re not going to let him do that. And these speakers are going to give us an insight about how we can do that. So we should leave the symposium, smiling and full of joy. Hallelujah.\n\nEric Sammons:\n\nAmen. Amen. Well, I would just want to say, I’m looking forward to attending… yes, everybody watching us know I am attending this symposium. I can’t wait to get down there and hear all the speakers and meet the different people and things like that. So what I’m going to do is… so it’s October 15th. It’s just a one day symposium, a Saturday in Dallas, Texas. And I’m going to put the links to the proper places where you can find out more about it, buy tickets, things like that. I just highly recommend it. Obviously if you’re in the area of Dallas, really, you got to make it. It’s not very expensive. It’s just one day. And even if you’re traveling like I am, from another location, I really do think it could be worth it for so many reasons.\n\nDavid Ross:\n\nLet me add to that. I can’t tell you how many people from different states outside of Texas are coming. This is an unusual high percentage. They’re coming from all four corners of the country. Just recently, I was mentioning something like that to Bishop Schneider, and he said, “I have a message for people who are coming. And he says, I want you to not let your faith be shaken by societal disruptions. Be strong in your faith. I’m coming to bring you joy. And I want to see you all in Dallas”. That is his message for us. And there are many priests coming. There might be a couple of bishops coming. There’s an unusual high quantity of priests coming.\n\nAnd again, it is not an event that’s going to depress you. I don’t want people depressed. We got that enough. We’re going to be pumped. We’re going to reclaim our joy and look, consider this, Eric, our political fortunes, they come, they go, they come back, they go away again. Our material possessions, too. But through it all, like Karl, we’re going to keep our joy. The devil wants to take that. He’s not going to shake our faith. We are not going to lose our joy. And I hope that’s what this symposium is going to bring to you, and anyone else who wants to come. blessedkarl.org.\n\nEric Sammons:\n\nAmen. Amen. Well, okay, we’ll end it there. I really appreciate you coming on the program, David, this is great.\n\nDavid Ross:\n\nThank you.\n\nEric Sammons:\n\nI mean, I’m even more enthusiastic now. I want October 15th to come even sooner, but hopefully it will come when it comes. So I’m looking forward to it. Again, thank you. For everybody else watching, I just encourage you to consider attending the conference. If you can’t make it for any reason, pray for its success, that all the speakers get there fine, all the attendees get there, fine, everything goes smoothly. I know what it’s like. I’ve organized conferences myself and symposiums in the past. I know… a lot of work, so I know you’re very busy. So I really appreciate you taking your time out to come on the program here.\n\nDavid Ross:\n\nMy pleasure. Thank you brother. Thank you.\n\nEric Sammons:\n\nOkay, until next time everybody, God love you.",

    "Austria in violation of EU labour market laws": "The European Commission has notified the Austrian government of its failure to signal the transposition of new EU labour market directives, kickstarting the bloc’s infringement procedure that could end at the European Court of Justice.\n\nOn Wednesday, several EU countries were found violating EU law. In the case of Austria, two new laws regulating the labour market were not properly transposed into domestic law, a requirement with directives.\n\nVienna failed to do so for the 2019 law on transparent and predictable working conditions, which is meant to bolster workers’ rights to information about their job. Workers in precarious, informal forms of employment stand to benefit from this.\n\nThe government also failed to ensure a 2019 law that was designed to further the work-life balance of parents and carers. The directive introduced paternity leave and a minimum of ten free days for fathers.\n\nAustria is far from alone in failing to meet the demands of EU law. In all, 24 EU countries have failed to notify full transposition of the latest batch of the ten new EU laws. Italy, Lithuania and Estonia were the only countries not to receive a letter on Thursday.\n\nVienna has been given two months to respond or address the issue before the Commission takes the next step, a “reasoned opinion.”\n\n(Nikolaus J.
