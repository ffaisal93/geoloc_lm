    "Ebola Disease caused by Sudan virus - Uganda": "Outbreak at a glance\n\nOn 20 September 2022, Uganda health authorities declared an outbreak of Ebola disease, caused by Sudan virus, following laboratory confirmation of a patient from a village in Madudu sub-county, Mubende district, central Uganda.\n\nAs of 25 September 2022, a cumulative number of 18 confirmed and 18 probable cases have been reported from Mubende, Kyegegwa and Kassanda districts, including 23 deaths, of which five were among confirmed cases (CFR among confirmed cases 28%). This is the first Ebola disease outbreak caused by Sudan virus (SUDV) in Uganda since 2012.\n\nDescription of the outbreak\n\nOn 20 September 2022, the health authorities in Uganda declared an outbreak of Ebola disease caused by Sudan virus (SUDV), after a case was confirmed in a village of Madudu sub-county in Mubende district, central Uganda.\n\nThe case was a 24-year-old male who developed a wide range of symptoms on 11 September including high-grade fever, tonic convulsions, blood-stained vomit and diarrhoea, loss of appetite, pain while swallowing, chest pain, dry cough and bleeding in the eyes. He visited two private clinics, successively between 11-13 and 13-15 September without improvement. He was then referred to the Regional Referral Hospital (RRH) on 15 September where he was isolated as a suspected case of viral haemorrhagic fever. A blood sample was collected on 17 September and sent to the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) in Kampala where RT- PCR tests conducted were positive for SUDV on 19 September. On the same day, the patient died.\n\nResults of preliminary investigations identified a number of community deaths from an unknown illness in Madudu and Kiruma sub-counties of Mubende district reported in the first two weeks of September. These deaths are now considered to be probable cases of Ebola caused by SUDV.\n\nAs of 25 September 2022, a cumulative number of 36 cases (18 confirmed and 18 probable cases) have been reported from Mubende (14 confirmed and 18 probable), Kyegegwa (three confirmed cases) and Kassanda (one confirmed case) districts. Twenty-three deaths have been recorded, of which five were among confirmed cases (CFR among confirmed cases 28%). Of the total confirmed and suspected cases, 62% are female and 38% are male. There are currently 13 confirmed cases hospitalized. The median age of the cases is 26 years (range 1 year to 60 years). A cumulative number of 223 contacts have been listed.\n\nEpidemiology of the disease\n\nAccording to the International Classification of Disease for filoviruses (ICD-11) released in May 2019, Ebola disease is now sub-categorized depending on the causative virus. Outbreaks of Ebola disease caused by Sudan virus are named Sudan Virus Disease (SVD) outbreaks. Prior to May 2019 all viruses causing Ebola disease were grouped together. Based on the results of laboratory tests, this outbreak is caused by Sudan virus.\n\nSudan virus disease is a severe, often fatal illness affecting humans. Sudan virus was first reported in southern Sudan in June 1976, since then the virus has emerged periodically and up to now, seven outbreaks caused by SUDV have been reported, four in Uganda and three in Sudan. The estimated case fatality ratios of SVD have varied from 41% to 100% in past outbreaks.\n\nThe virus is introduced into the human population through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals such as fruit bats, chimpanzees, gorillas, monkeys, forest antelope or porcupines found ill or dead or in the rainforest. The virus then spreads through human-to-human transmission via direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with either blood or body fluids of a person who is sick with or has died from SVD or objects that have been contaminated with body fluids (like blood, faeces, vomit) from a person sick with SVD or the body of a person who died from SVD.\n\nThe incubation period ranges from 2 to 21 days. People infected with Sudan virus cannot spread the disease until they develop symptoms, and they remain infectious as long as their blood contains the virus. Symptoms of SVD can be sudden and include fever, fatigue, muscle pain, headache, and sore throat later followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, symptoms of impaired kidney and liver function. In some cases, the patient might present both internal and external bleeding (for example, bleeding from the gums, or blood in the stools).\n\nThe diagnosis of SVD can be difficult, as early nonspecific manifestation of the disease may mimic other infectious diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever and meningitis. Confirmation is made using numerous diagnostic methods including RT-PCR. Supportive care - rehydration with oral or intravenous fluids - and treatment of specific symptoms improve survival.\n\nThere are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of Sudan virus disease.\n\nUganda has reported four SVD outbreaks, in 2000, 2011 and 2012 (two outbreaks). Uganda also reported a Bundibugyo virus disease outbreak in 2007 and an Ebola virus disease outbreak in 2019.\n\nPublic health response\n\nCoordination\n\nThe Ministry of Health (MOH) established a National Task Force, with WHO providing technical support\n\nThe Incidence Management Team was activated both within the MOH and the WHO country office\n\nThe MOH Incident Commander has been deployed to Mubende District to support response efforts in the affected region\n\nWHO is supporting the orientation of the leadership at the Regional Referral Hospital and the district health team on early identification and case management\n\nA response plan is being developed and priority actions have been identified\n\nSurveillance and Laboratory\n\nWHO has supported the activation of surveillance structures in districts\n\nContact tracing and active case finding are ongoing\n\nWHO has deployed a technical team in Mubende district to support surveillance\n\nCase Management\n\nWHO has supported the assessment of the isolation unit at the regional referral Hospital and dispatched an Ebola disease kit and tent for the isolation of patients\n\nWHO has deployed a central team of experts to support the establishment of a treatment unit in the Regional Referral Hospital\n\nInfection prevention and control (IPC) teams were deployed to support capacity building of health workers in IPC and the establishment of screening and triage at all health facilities in affected districts\n\nCommunication and Risk Communication\n\nAs part of the communication and risk communication activities, WHO provided technical support for the organization of the press conference on Ebola and the development and dissemination of a press statement by the Ministry of Health\n\nCurrently, WHO is supporting the review of Information, Education and Communication (IEC) material for dissemination to the public\n\nWHO risk assessment\n\nUganda has experience in responding to Ebola virus disease and Sudan virus disease outbreaks, and necessary action has been initiated quickly. The current outbreak is the first Ebola disease outbreak caused by Sudan virus in Uganda since 2012.\n\nIn the absence of licensed vaccines and therapeutics for prevention and treatment of Sudan virus disease, the risk of potential serious public health impact is high. Community deaths and care of patients in private facilities and hospitals and other community health services with limited protection and infection prevention and control measures entail a high risk of many transmission chains. Investigations are ongoing to determine the scope of the outbreak and the possibility of spreading to other districts. Importation of cases to neighbouring countries cannot be ruled out at this stage.\n\nAccording to the information currently available, the overall risk has been assessed as high at national level considering: (i) the confirmed Sudan virus and the lack of an authorized vaccine (ii) the possibility that the event started three weeks before the identification of the index case and several transmission chains have not been not tracked; (iii) patients presented at various facilities with suboptimal infection, prevention and control (IPC) practices including inadequate use of personal protective equipment (PPE); the patients died and were traditionally buried with large gathering ceremonies; (iv) although the country has developed an increased capacity to respond to Ebola outbreaks over recent years, and has a local capacity that can be easily mobilized and organised with available resources to mount a robust response, the system could be overwhelmed if the number of cases increases and the outbreak spreads to other sub-counties, districts and regions, as the country simultaneously responds to multiple emergencies, including anthrax, COVID-19, Rift Valley fever and Yellow fever, as well as flooding and prevailing food insecurity.\n\nIn addition, the outbreak was detected among individuals living around an active local gold mine. Mobility among traders of this commodity is likely to be high, and the declaration of the outbreak may cause some miners already incubating the disease to flee.\n\nThe currently affected Mubende district has no international borders. Nevertheless, the risk of international spread cannot be ruled out due to the active cross-border population movement. In addition, investigations are ongoing to establish transmission chains and the scope of the outbreak is yet to be determined.\n\nAt Regional and Global levels, the overall risk has been assessed as low.\n\nWHO advice\n\nEffective outbreak control relies on applying a package of interventions, including case management, surveillance and contact tracing, an optimal laboratory service, implementation of infection prevention and control measures in health care and community settings, safe and dignified burials and community engagement and social mobilization. Community engagement is essential to successfully controlling outbreaks. Raising awareness of risk factors for Ebola infection and protective measures that individuals can take is an effective way to reduce human transmission.\n\nEarly initiation of supportive treatment has been shown to significantly reduce deaths from Ebola disease. There is a need to strengthen surveillance and other response activities to contain the possibility of exponential spread.\n\nBased on available evidence the ERVEBO vaccine — used in the recent responses against the Ebola virus disease outbreaks — will not provide cross-protection against the Sudan virus disease.\n\nThe Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) vaccine called Zabdeno/Mvabea against Ebola has only been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) against Ebola virus disease and has not been tested against Sudan virus disease. This vaccine is administered on a two-dose schedule and requires 56 days between the two doses. The first dose provides protection against the Zaire ebolavirus and the second dose was designed to provide protection against other species of the virus, including Sudan. However, this multiantigen protection has not been demonstrated with clinical data. Even if the vaccine was tested and proved to be effective against Sudan ebolavirus, it would only provide protection some days after the second dose is administered. This means the vaccine is not appropriate for outbreak response.\n\nWHO advises against any restrictions on travel and/or trade to Uganda based on available information for the current outbreak.\n\nFurther information\n\nCitable reference: World Health Organization (26 September 2022).

    "Uganda holds first ever commemoration service for murdered chief justice": "26 September 2022 John Semakula\n\nKampala, Uganda\n\nUgandans have held the first ever commemoration service for former Chief Justice Benedicto Kiwanuka who was kidnapped and killed by Dictator Idi Amin in 1972.\n\nThe commemoration service held on Thursday at Lubaga Cathedral in Kampala was one of the activities conducted in the week to commemorate the life of a man considered by many in Uganda as an icon of justice and democracy whose murder affected Uganda’s pace of becoming a just and democratic nation.\n\nPresident Yoweri Museveni (left) arriving for the Benedicto Kiwanuka Commemoration Day at the High Court in Kampala on Wednesday. PICTURE: State House Picture.\n\nKiwanuka was one of the early leaders in the independence movement of Uganda and led the country as Prime Minister in the transition between colonial British rule and independence in 1962. He was also the President of the Democratic Party, one of the country’s two main Independence political parties. Kiwanuka was appointed Chief Justice in 1971, the year Idi Amin captured power through a military coup.\n\nHe is one of the thousands of Ugandans who were slaughtered during Amin’s reign of chaos and terror. Kiwanuka’s remains have never been located since 1972.\n\nIn a 2018 editorial titled \"Remembering Benedicto Kiwanuka\", Solomon Muyita, the senior communication officer with the judiciary in Uganda, observed that despite his short-lived period in office, Kiwanuka left an indelible mark in the country’s legal fraternity.\n\n“His mastery of the law, impartiality and zeal for the rule of law have inspired many over the decades,” Muyita wrote. “He fiercely and above self, protected the rights of all for which he paid the ultimate price with his life.”\n\nIn his book, Uganda Since Independence: A Story of unfilled Hopes, author Phares Mutibwa asserted that Amin murdered Kiwanuka because he perceived him to be a potential rival leader. Eyewitnesses reports indicate that the army seized Kiwanuka from the High Court although Amin’s military denied the allegations, insisting that government impostors then were behind his disappearance.\n\nDuring last Thursday’s commemoration service, Kiwanuka was praised for his exemplary leadership while a priest, Fr Richard Nyombi, said there had been calls for the Catholic Church to have Kiwanuka canonised.\n\nArchbishop Augustine Kasujja, a former Apostolic Nuncio, said in a sermon that “we cannot speak of peace and justice as human beings without real effort and determination to create an ethical and moral background for our society\". He urged the flock to emulate Kiwanuka.\n\nIn his remarks, Uganda’s current Chief Justice, Alfonse Owiny-Dollo, noted that people like Kiwanuka are very rare in the world today.\n\n“They come to serve a purpose, which is discovered long after they are gone. When you study Uganda’s political history, then you understand the importance of such people.”\n\nRev Emanuel Sita, the archdiocese’s Department of Peace and Justice, said that Archbishop Paul Ssemogerere had decided to hold a memorial mass for Benedicto Kiwanuka on the day he is believed to have been killed as part of its activities marking Peace Week, which ran from 1st to 9th September.\n\n“Besides being the son of the Catholic Church, Benedicto was also an active and practicing parishioner of Lubaga Cathedral Parish,\" he said.\n\nWe rely on our readers to fund Sight's work - become a financial supporter today!\n\nOn Wednesday, Uganda's judiciary held a commemoration to mark the 5th Benedicto Kiwanuka’s Day. President Yoweri Museveni was among those who attended, saluting the former chief justice for being forthright and truthful by opposing chauvinism and the adoption of a tribal agenda in favour of a national position and unity.\n\nBut Museveni said Kiwanuka should not have accepted to work under Amin from the start.\n\n“Kiwanuka turned out to be a martyr under circumstances he should not have been in the first place,” Museveni said.\n\nThe main opposition political figure in Uganda, Robert Kyagulanyi, alias Bobi Wine, said during the service that Benedicto Kiwanuka’s Day came at the time when Uganda was still struggling with political challenges similar to those that existed in Amin’s regime and that supporters of his political party, the National Unity Platform, are being kidnapped, tortured and imprisoned by the state.",
    "Uganda: Opposition kicks off Consultations on Copyright Law": "Opposition MPs have started holding stakeholder engagements with a view of improving a draft private Members’ Bill that seeks to amend the 2006 Copyright and Neighbouring Rights Act.\n\nThe Bill is sponsored by the Shadow Minister for Culture and Performing Arts, also Mawokota North MP, Hillary Innocent Kiyaga (NUP).\n\nThe first stakeholder meeting was held on Friday, September 23, 2022, at Parliament under the chairmanship of the Leader of the Opposition in Parliament (LOP), Hon Mathias Mpuuga, and drew the participation of officials from the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs led by the Deputy Solicitor General, Pius Biribonwoha, Uganda Registration Services Bureau (URSB) and representatives from the arts industry.\n\nThe proposed amendment seeks to close gaps in the 2006 law to recognize and protect the rights of a composer of artistic work and to streamline the registration of copyrights among others.\n\nThe Registrar General, Mercy Kainobwisho told the meeting that while her agency, URSB recognizes that there are gaps in the existing law coupled with implementation challenges, there is no need for a Private Members’ Bill her entity had already engaged Uganda Law Reform Commission to process an amendment that would lead to the domestication of international treaties on copyright and audiovisual performances.\n\n“The provisions of this Bill and the proposed amendments of the current Act may be parallel to the steps URSB is taking to amend the Act,” Kainobwisho said.\n\nHer submissions were however challenged by MPs, Abdulhu Byakatonda (Ind., Workers), Geoffrey Kayemba Solo (NUP, Bukomansimbi South) and Kiyaga. Their concerns were amplified by artistes, Hannington Bugingo (comedian) and Sylver Kyagulanyi from the Copyright Institute.\n\n“We wish to have this law amended in the areas of regulation, administration and protection. Regulation is so pertinent because we already have an existing issue with [Uganda Communications Commission] UCC,” Kyagulanyi said in reference to the stage plays and public performance rules which were announced by UCC in 2019.\n\n“We the creatives need to be regulated but what UCC is doing is an exhibition of the gap in the current law. UCC is using a 1964 draconian law – The Stage Plays and Public Entertainment Act which ought to be repealed. UCC would be within their mandate if they try to regulate broadcast but are trying to [stretch their mandate] to the regulation of everything including creativity and creative work,” he added.\n\nThe meeting later agreed to a harmonization of the positions of the two sides and hold joint consultations to have the legislation processed within the current financial year.\n\n“With these very good proposals, if we don’t sit and agree on the issues as we have heard them, we [risk] talking about the 2022 law the same way we are talking about the 2006 law,” Biribonwoha said.\n\nDistributed by APO Group on behalf of Parliament of the Republic of Uganda.",

    "Inter-Agency Situation Report - Uganda Refugee Emergency (9 - 15 September 2022) - Uganda": "Uganda continues to receive new arrivals from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and South Sudan, through the Southwestern and Northern borders. The security situation in all operational areas is unpredictable as armed conflicts are still active in DRC and South Sudan.\n\nHeavy rains are causing delays and postponement of service delivery, flooding of settlement areas and damage to shelters as well as latrines.\n\nThe new arrival trends from South Sudan and DRC are high, putting pressure on available facilities at collection points and transit centres across the operation. The average latrine coverage ratio is 1:20 individuals. Due to the high numbers, it is now 1:434 individuals. The holding capacity at Nyakabande transit centre (Kisoro district) is overstretched by 87 per cent (capacity of 7,200 with 13,465 individuals currently).\n\nLokung collection point in Lamwo district, is over stretched by 261 per cent (capacity of 560 with 2,019 individuals currently), while Kagoma reception centre (Kikuube district) by 97 per cent (capacity of 1,000 holds 1966 individuals). The pressure is partly attributed to lack of core relief items (CRIs) affecting relocation to settlements. There is need for additional funds to cater for procurement of CRIs.",
    "Uganda rejects UN definition of abortion as a human right": "Uganda has joined several other African countries to oppose the contentious United Nations Human Rights Committee’s definition of abortion as a human right.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines abortion as termination of pregnancy prior to 20 weeks gestation.\n\nDr Jesca Nsungwa, the Commissioner for Maternal and Child Health at the Ministry of Health, told this publication yesterday that abortion in Uganda is illegal and that the country does not support UN definition of the act as a human right.\n\n“We don’t promote or support abortion in Uganda. We are pro-life and, therefore, we oppose that definition,” Dr Nsungwa said in telephone interview, “There are many things that are promoted as a human rights including homosexuality but we do not support them given our laws, culture and morals, “she added.\n\nInternational media reports indicate that a United Nations resolution defining abortion as a human right and advancing gender ideology was passed early this month, and was backed by majority of Western countries, but was rejected by others, especially from Africa.\n\nAccording to fsspx news, the resolution’s focus on abortion and gender ideology was criticised by 33 countries, mostly located in Africa.\n\nIt reported that among the 32 nations that joined Nigeria in supporting amendments to strike abortion and gender language from the resolution were Uganda, Cameroon, Ethiopia and Senegal. The Philippines, Nicaragua, Russia and a handful of Middle Eastern countries also joined the effort.\n\nSenegal’s representative condemned the inclusion of abortion as a method of family planning and argued that the word ‘gender’ should only refer to “social relations between men and women.”\n\nThe Deputy Speaker of Parliament, Mr Thomas Tayebwa, in April said that he would promote and protect human rights, including fighting abortion.\n\n“I promise the Parliament and the people of Uganda that I will do things that will give respect to God. Personally, I have values that I believe in. We must respect the lives of every individual including the unborn. I’m pro-life,” Mr Tayebwa emphasised.\n\nArticle 22 of the 1995 Constitution provides for the right to life and Article 22(2) clearly states that no one has the right to terminate an unborn child except if authorised by law.\n\nDr Nsungwa also said unsafe abortion is a vice that must be fought to save the lives of women and girls. According to the Ministry of Health, Uganda loses about 16 women and girls on a daily basis and complications arising from unsafe abortion account for about 22 percent of deaths.\n\nWHO abortion stand",

    "US Overtakes Uganda in Buying Kenyan Goods": "New figures from Kenya's National Bureau of Statistics show the United States has overtaken Uganda as the largest buyer of Kenyan goods.\n\nThe numbers from Kenya's National Bureau of Statistics show that between January and June 2022, Kenya's exports to the United States totaled 38.8 billion Kenyan shillings — the equivalent of about $321 million.\n\nUganda's imports from Kenya dipped to about $300 million.\n\nAccording to the report, the jump was caused mainly by increased sales of Kenyan clothing apparel to the U.S.\n\nEconomists such as Ken Gichinga say the figures are a sign of Kenya’s deepening bilateral relationship with the U.S., including increased direct flights to New York.\n\n\"Americans have a bigger purchasing power for products in Kenya,\" Gichinga said. \"You find that American investors will find it a very good time to be able to purchase assets and buy things in Kenya because now, the market is in their favor.\"\n\nUganda has been the biggest buyer of Kenyan exports for over a decade. But a Kenyan publication, Business Daily, reports that Uganda's imports from Kenya have dropped as investors set up Ugandan factories to manufacture goods previously imported from Kenya, such as edible oils and cement.\n\nWangari Muikia, a Kenyan economist, said the country's strong relations with the U.S., backed by the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), will likely continue to thrive as the new government of President William Ruto is keen on more American partnerships.\n\nIn his visit to the United Nations General Assembly this week, Ruto met with U.S. State Department officials and pitched for increased business between the two nations.\n\n\"The new government is signaling pushing for greater trade with the U.S., with President Ruto meeting with the U.S. trade officials this week,\" Muikia said. \"Most excitingly in tech, where Kenya's Silicon Savannah is excelling now, a market like the U.S. will open up business for Kenya and the region.\"\n\nKenya is among African nations benefiting from a U.S. shift in foreign policy as it scales up its presence on the continent. The U.S. trade office said the two countries are developing a road map of engagement in agriculture, digital trade, customs procedure and other areas.",

Refugees are provided with plots of land for housing and cultivation. Refugees and host communities access the same health facilities, and their children attend schools together.\n\nImportant gains in refugee self-reliance and economic inclusion are now at risk due to severe underfunding for UNHCR's operations in the country.\n\nBy the end of August, UNHCR had received just 38 per cent of its 2022 funding requirement of US$343.4 million to respond to the needs of refugees in Uganda, as determined at the start of this year.\n\nThe funding gap has strained UNHCR's capacity to provide critical support, including basic humanitarian assistance, child protection services, civil registration, and livelihood opportunities.\n\nRefugees are seeing a sharp reduction in support for income-generating activities, including for agricultural inputs that are critical to cultivating allocated land.\n\nChildren, especially girls, face a high risk of dropping out of school as UNHCR will be unable to pay teachers’ salaries, and already crowded classrooms will increase in size. With no more funding to procure soap and hygiene kits for women and girls, their health and access to education will be negatively affected. UNHCR cannot afford to purchase new stocks of medicines for health centres, while progress in reducing child and maternal mortality will regress, and infant malnutrition will increase.\n\nUNHCR and its partners need urgent financial contributions to meet the urgent needs of new refugee arrivals in Uganda, to upgrade the reception capacity and basic infrastructure of refugee settlements and prioritize the relocation of refugees to more suitable facilities.\n\nKisoro, in southwest Uganda, has received most new arrivals from the DRC. At the Nyakabande transit centre, refugees – overwhelmingly women and children – face substandard and crowded conditions which expose them to risks, including gender-based violence.\n\nFor more information on this topic, please contact:",
    "Uganda pays first installment of $325m war reparations to DRC": "The International Court of Justice asked Uganda to pay reparations for its troops’ occupation of DRC back in the 1990s.\n\nUganda has paid $65m in the first instalment of the $325m it was ordered to pay the neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) as compensation for losses caused by wars in the 1990s when Ugandan troops occupied Congolese territory.\n\n“It’s true we have paid $65m as the first instalment,” finance ministry spokesman Apollo Munghinda said on Monday. The payment was made on September 1, he added.\n\nThe DRC government’s spokesman, Patrick Muyaya, confirmed to Reuters news agency that the first of the five instalments had been received.\n\nIn a case first brought against Uganda in 1999, DRC asked the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to compel Uganda to pay it $11bn as reparations for the deaths, looting and general economic damage caused by Uganda’s military occupation of parts of DRC in the 1990s.\n\nAfter lengthy proceedings, the ICJ, United Nations’ highest court, ruled in 2005 that Uganda had violated international law by occupying parts of eastern DRC and supporting other armed groups during a conflict that raged from 1998 to 2003.\n\nThe court, which deals with disputes between states and whose rulings are final and cannot be appealed, ordered the two parties to negotiate reparations. In 2015, however, the DRC told the court that the talks had stalled.\n\nThe ICJ judges finally ruled in February this year that Uganda should pay $325m in five yearly instalments of $65m, starting in September this year.\n\nThe ICJ broke down the compensation into different categories of damages. It assessed $225m for “loss of life and other damage to persons” that included rape, conscription of child soldiers and the displacement of up to 500,000 people.\n\nUgandan soldiers who had been fighting rebels in DRC for the previous three years crossed back into Uganda at the Mpondwe border point on October 15, 2001.\n\nThe court assessed another $40m for damage to property and $60m for damage to natural resources, including the plundering of gold, diamonds, timber and other goods by Ugandan forces or rebels they supported.",
    "Uganda: Is the First Lady flying above the vice president?": "Ugandan First Lady and Minister of Education and Sports Janet Kataha Museveni forced her way into politics in 2006 as a member of parliament, something that President Yoweri Museveni and other high-ranking members of the ruling party never supported.

    "Government of Uganda signs MOU for geothermal development": "Government of Uganda signs MOU for geothermal development\n\nKasese, Kaberole, Uganda (source: CleanSource Energy Partners)\n\nCarlo Cariaga 5 Sep 2022\n\nThe Government of Uganda has signed an MOU with ASKA Group for the development of a geothermal power project at Katwe-Kikorongo, Kasese District.\n\nThe Government of Uganda, represented by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development (MEMD), has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Canada-based ASKA Infrastructure Development (ASKA Group) for a potential geothermal power project in Katwe-Kikorongo, Kasese District. Work on this project is expected to proceed over the next 18 months and will be funded completely by the Canadian government and other international credit development agencies.\n\nKatwe-Kikorongo had already been previously recognized as one of the major potential geothermal areas in Western Uganda. Uganda has estimated geothermal resources of up to 1,500 MW from 24 areas in the Ugandan Rift System.\n\nMinister of State for Energy Hon. Okaasai Opolot pointed out the geothermal potential of Uganda particularly because of its location along the East Africa Rift Valley. This point was supported by ASKA Group President Kamaal Samji, who mentioned the presence of steam in the ground in places like Kasese.\n\nEnergy Ministry Permanent Secretary Eng. Irene Batebe noted that ASKA will be expected to conduct feasibility studies as part of the project. The work will also include securing the required licenses and permits. However, Batebe assured that the Ministry will help in supporting this process by providing all the necessary information or facilitating the authorization process if needed.\n\nDuring the meeting between ASKA Group and the Ministry, Okaasai mentioned that power generation companies in Uganda can now independently generate, transmit, and distribute power to the end-user. This makes investments in the country’s power sector attractive while also empowering the population who rely on power to have stable and sustainable livelihoods.\n\nThe project is also expected to generate jobs for Ugandans. East Africa Project Liaison Salim Janmohamed assured the Minister that there will only be a maximum of 10 experts involved in the project and the rest of the employees will be locally hired and trained to meet international standards.\n\n“As climate is changing, we need to take a proactive role to diversify to clean energy. The project will provide clean energy for Uganda,” said ASKA Group CEO Dinu Samji, further stating that the project is in line with the global transition towards clean energy.\n\nSource: Uganda Update",

    "‘I watch people for signs’: the project finding and treating Uganda’s diabetic children": "On a night bus out of Kampala, the Ugandan capital, a 12-year-old child was constantly asking her uncle for water. She drank so much that finally she wet herself. Dankan Onzima, on his way home from a conference, was sitting behind the girl.\n\n“I felt bad and touched with what was happening to her,” Onzima says. “I had to wait until my destination, but they were going beyond my stop, so I asked the driver to give me two minutes to talk to the caretaker of the child and the driver allowed.”\n\nHe asked the girl’s uncle to take her to the diabetes clinic at Arua regional referral hospital, in northern Uganda, where Onzima works as a “warrior coordinator”, helping children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) – or warriors, as the hospital refers to them – get treatment and learn to use an insulin pen.\n\nQuick Guide A common condition Show The human toll of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is huge and rising. These illnesses end the lives of approximately 41 million of the 56 million people who die every year – and three quarters of them are in the developing world. NCDs are simply that; unlike, say, a virus, you can’t catch them. Instead, they are caused by a combination of genetic, physiological, environmental and behavioural factors. The main types are cancers, chronic respiratory illnesses, diabetes and cardiovascular disease – heart attacks and stroke. Approximately 80% are preventable, and all are on the rise, spreading inexorably around the world as ageing populations and lifestyles pushed by economic growth and urbanisation make being unhealthy a global phenomenon. NCDs, once seen as illnesses of the wealthy, now have a grip on the poor. Disease, disability and death are perfectly designed to create and widen inequality – and being poor makes it less likely you will be diagnosed accurately or treated. Investment in tackling these common and chronic conditions that kill 71% of us is incredibly low, while the cost to families, economies and communities is staggeringly high. In low-income countries NCDs – typically slow and debilitating illnesses – are seeing a fraction of the money needed being invested or donated. Attention remains focused on the threats from communicable diseases, yet cancer death rates have long sped past the death toll from malaria, TB and HIV/Aids combined. 'A common condition' is a new Guardian series reporting on NCDs in the developing world: their prevalence, the solutions, the causes and consequences, telling the stories of people living with these illnesses.

Thank you for your feedback.\n\nAs Onzima suspected, the girl had T1D and is now receiving free insulin and has a glucometer to keep track of her blood glucose levels.\n\n“Now I am happy that the child is under treatment,” says Onzima. “I closely monitor people around me for any ignored signs and symptoms of T1D.”\n\nOnzima, 24, was diagnosed at the Arua clinic in 2015 – a day he calls “the happiest moment of my life” – after months of not understanding what was wrong. At one point, typhoid and malaria were suspected. It left him feeling “lost, alone and scared, urinating all the time, scared to be outside my house just in case I urinate on myself, losing weight”.\n\nAlthough Onzima now has to carry a glucometer and insulin flex pen, the treatment meant he could pursue his education – he is now in his final year at Uganda’s Muni University.\n\nNurse Jeofrey Ojilong with a young patient at a camp in Lira, Uganda. Photograph: Oscar Ntege/Sonia Nabeta Foundation\n\nThe Arua clinic is among 31 facilities across Uganda participating in a new scheme helping T1D patients, spearheaded by the Sonia Nabeta Foundation (SNF). The foundation uses Uganda’s network of motorcycle taxis, or boda-bodas, to deliver insulin and other supplies to patients in the most remote areas.\n\nThe Covid pandemic and lockdown exacerbated the vulnerabilities of low-income children with T1D, making it impossible for some to access medication.\n\n“In Uganda, the lockdown comprised of a public transportation ban and a 2pm curfew for cargo deliveries. Uganda [had] the world’s longest school lockdown and some of the most stringent Covid restrictions,” says Vivian Nabeta, SNF’s founder.\n\n“In normal circumstances, children from low-income households face difficulties accessing essential supplies from their healthcare centres. Our data has revealed that children sometimes travel up to 5.5 hours round trip to get to and from the clinic for essential supplies, with the major part of the trip on foot.”\n\nOnzima said the use of boda-bodas has bridged the distribution gap, and transformed “how the warriors manage their sugar levels”.\n\n“With home visits, we get to see the warrior in his or her home, see the food he or she eats, see the family and understand better how the warrior is living and how we can help,” he says.\n\nWarrior coordinators Dankan Onzima and Mustapha Abdallah at the diabetes clinic in Arua. Photograph: Sonia Nabeta Foundation\n\nThe SNF was set up in 2016 after Nabeta’s sister, Sonia, died due to hypoglycemia, a T1D complication. Initially, she began organising four-day peer-to-peer education camps, and helped with scholarships for primary school students, before launching the boda-boda project last year, reaching 2,000 children.\n\nMore than 420 million people across the globe have diabetes, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, according to the World Heath Organization. A chronic and metabolic disease characterised by elevated levels of blood sugar, diabetes is responsible for about 1.5 million global deaths a year.\n\nType 2 diabetes, the most prevalent form, is often linked to lifestyle choices, whileT1D is a genetic condition often developed during childhood in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin by itself.\n\n“In Africa, children with T1D face suboptimal outcomes and premature deaths due to a variety of reasons, including lack of access to essential medical supplies and – perhaps most importantly – the failure to address the social determinants of health, including factors like poverty, psychosocial barriers, education,” Nabeta says. Only four paediatric endocrinologists operate across Uganda.\n\n“Our work has illustrated that it is not enough to provide insulin, syringes and a glucometer if the child is surrounded by abject poverty, food insecurity, illiteracy and other barriers towards good clinical outcomes. It has illustrated that addressing the social determinants of health and psychosocial barriers is paramount,” says Nabeta.\n\nShe said children have died from a hypoglycemic attack simply because families did not have any sugary item at home to stop it, while in other households distrust over modern medication has to be overcome.\n\nOne 17-year-old died, despite being on the SNF programme, because his family took his insulin away, resorting to “traditional medicine or going off to prayer crusades hoping the child will be healed”.\n\nProssy Lanyero, a teenage T1D patient at Lacor hospital clinic in Gulu, gets drugs through the boda-boda project. “Transport used to be a very big problem because I am a good distance away from the clinic,” she says.\n\n“I used to have a hard time following my appointment date. I used to ask the nurse to give me insulin for two or three months, but it would go bad because I have no refrigerator to properly store the insulin. I would use the bad insulin anyway because of transport problems,” she says.\n\n“In the past my family used to carry most of the burden of my care and I would feel bad but I feel that some of the weight has been lifted so now they can focus on my other needs too.”\n\nLucy Akwero, the mother of a 14-year-old T1D patient in Amuru, says her family struggled to find money for hospital travel – and her son even stopped going to school because it.\n\n“We were always anxious and worried, and my son was sad and hopeless,” she says. “Sometimes I would even sell our own food when it is approaching my son’s clinic appointment day. We do not have to worry about clinic appointments any more, my son now speaks good English, he is confident and happy.”\n\nSign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:",
    "Uganda, Kinshasa extend military operation in eastern DR Congo": "By JONATHAN KAMOGA More by this Author\n\nUganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo have announced an extension of their joint military cooperation that saw the two countries’ armies launch an offensive against the Allied Democratic Forces rebels holed up in eastern DRC.\n\nAccording to a statement from the Uganda People’s Defence Forces (UPDF), the extension was signed Thursday by the defence ministers of both countries in the DRC capital of Kinshasa.\n\n“Uganda and DRC jointly extend operations in eastern DRC following a joint ministerial review meeting of ministers of Defence of both countries in Kinshasa. The ministers also approved Standard Operating Procedures for handling ADF combatants who defect or surrender,” the statement reads in part.\n\nAccording to UPDF deputy spokesperson Col Deo Akiiki, the new extension will span two months as have the previous ones since the start of the operation.\n\n“The ongoing operations are normally reviewed after every two months by CDFs who then make recommendations to ministers of Defence,” he said.\n\nThe statement adds that the ministers reviewed the current situation in eastern DRC and ongoing joint operation code named Shuja, following the third meeting of Chiefs of Defence Forces that happened recently in Kampala.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUganda’s technical team was led by Maj Gen Dick Prit Olum, while FARDC was represented by Chief of General Staff Gen Célestin Mbala.\n\nIn November last year, the UPDF and their Congolese counterparts the Forces Armées de la République Démocratique du Congo (FARDC) launched a joint offensive against the ADF rebels.\n\nKampala sought Kinshasa’s permission to pursue the rebels, accusing them of orchestrating several assassinations of government officials, suicide bombings and recruiting of Ugandans to their ranks.\n\nThe ADF has been an anti-Uganda terrorist group since mid-1990s, but recently established links with the Islamic States of Syria and Iraq (ISIS).\n\nThe United Nations says the group is responsible for about 200 killings and displacement of 40,000 people in DRC from the 155 attacks they carried out in 2020 alone.\n\nThe joint operation is currently in its third phase, according to Maj Peter Mugisa, the spokesperson of the UPDF mountain brigade. This third phase involves chasing down fleeing insurgents who fled when officers of the joint military operation bombarded their hideouts.\n\nThis phase also includes securing communities, and recruiting and training local defence units that are left behind to thwart possible attacks from the rebels.\n\n“For the past one month, we have been pursuing these rebels to wherever they have been running and we are still doing exactly that,” Mugisa said.",
    "Whatever happened to the teens who endured the world's longest COVID school closure?": "Whatever happened to the teens who endured the world's longest COVID school closure?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Esther Ruth Mbabazi for NPR Esther Ruth Mbabazi for NPR\n\nAbout This Series Over the next week, we'll be looking back at some of our favorite Goats and Soda stories to see \"whatever happened to ...\"\n\nIn January 2022, Uganda ended the longest pandemic school lockdown in the world. As the country's roughly 15 million school-going children were summoned back to class, we spoke with six youths from poor families in one of the largest slums in Kampala, the capital city. The teens shared their feelings about returning to school after almost two years and their dreams for their future. For some, family hardships meant they couldn't afford the school fees that would enable them to return. Now, eight months since the reopening, we returned to their community of Kamwokya and were able to reach five of the six teens we profiled to learn how they are faring.\n\nThere are definitely happy stories among the teens we'd interviewed early this year.\n\nKusemerwa Jonathan Henry, age 16, is a busy kid – enrolled in school but still running the small business he started during the pandemic. With some financial help from his dad, he opened a fruit and vegetable stand that is going strong. By a Kamwokya roadside, Henry sorts fresh mud-covered Irish potatoes. \"I continue to balance my school term and work. So, it's been easy to do both,\" he says. The next term in Uganda starts on September 5, and once class is in session, he'll work at the stall after school. \"Even though there was a lot to cover, I've picked up real fast. I've been studying hard.\"\n\nBabilinda George, Henry's father, can't hide his pride for his son's efforts. The teen has already saved enough to pay for the next term's full tuition, he says. George only has to contribute a little bit for supplies and extras. \"He makes my life easy.\"\n\nBut the matter of school fees has been an obstacle. At Kololo Senior Secondary School , which several of the teens attend, tuition, supplies and uniforms cost roughly $135 for each of the three school year terms.\n\nAnd global events have contributed to a bumpy back-to-school for several of our Kamwokya teens. Once the Ukraine war began, Uganda's fuel prices shot up and in turn affected prices of food and everyday essentials. So school fees were out of reach for some of the teens' families. In some cases the students we interviewed have not been able to start school – or risk being sent home if their families made an initial payment but haven't been able to cover all the costs.\n\nMary Goretti Nakabugo, the executive director of Uwezo Uganda, a nonprofit organization working to promote equitable quality education, says that many parents are struggling to make ends meet. \"For some of them, it might be a choice between survival and sending back children to school.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Esther Ruth Mbabazi for NPR Esther Ruth Mbabazi for NPR\n\nKisakye Melissa, now age 15, is one of the teenagers who has yet to return to a classroom since the reopening of school. Her mother earns money by handwashing clothes for locals. During the shutdown, Melissa helped. But they didn't earn enough money for the tuition due when schools reopened. And as 2022 wore on, fewer people dropped off laundry, so Melissa had nothing to do. Her mother sent to a nearby village to help her grandmother with daily tasks.\n\nAfter reading about Melissa's family in the February article that NPR published, African Girls Can, a nonprofit organization training women entrepreneurs in Uganda and elsewhere, hoped to sponsor Melissa. But the organization only supports secondary school students, and Melissa has yet to complete primary education. At age 15, she's only in the equivalent of roughly grade five. She must complete grade seven before entering high school.\n\n\"I feel bad and it scares me that if I ever get the chance to return to school, I will be too old. Children will laugh at me,\" Melissa says. However, she now has reason to hope that scenario won't come true. Her mother went to Sharp Primary School in Kamwokya and asked whether the school would accept tuition payments \"in small bits,\" she says. It was this possibility of returning to school that brought Melissa back from her grandmother's village to Kamwokya. The school agreed to the arrangement, and so finally, she will go back to class at the start of the September term.\n\nNakabugo hopes other schools prove as flexible: \"We are not saying that schools should not charge but they should accept installments. Because parents also need to know that schools cannot run without money.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Esther Ruth Mbabazi for NPR Esther Ruth Mbabazi for NPR\n\nNaigaga Rebecca Mercy's parents came up with some tuition money but ended up short of what was needed for her full tuition and supplies. \"Even if the balance is just 1 cent, they will send you home,\" says the 14-year-old. In August, \"I was sent back home just a few days before the final term examinations,\" she explains.\n\nMercy was ultimately able to sit for some exams but not others. Schools sometimes make this kind of allowance to encourage families to pay off their remaining balance. Mercy's father earns a monthly salary as a factory worker, but it isn't enough for rent, tuition and other basics. This month, Mercy says her father must prioritize rent, which means that her school will not receive the expected deposit at the start of the September term. \"When school reopens, we are given one month before we are sent home,\" she says. She is determined to do \"whatever it takes\" to become a doctor or lawyer. \"I like school. I have to achieve my dream.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Esther Ruth Mbabazi for NPR Esther Ruth Mbabazi for NPR\n\nTusiime Agnes's parents also were not able to pay fees in full. They paid only half tuition, which was enough for the now 15-year-old Agnes to return but not enough for the school to provide lunch. It's footwear that is most worrisome for this upcoming term, though. The school requires black leather dress shoes, \"which I don't have,\" she says. \"If you wear anything else, you are stopped right at the gate.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Esther Ruth Mbabazi for NPR Esther Ruth Mbabazi for NPR\n\nJoel Joseph is also worried about staying in school for the next semester. His single mother's small grocery shop was just shut down. \"The owner of the place she was renting sold it out and she had to leave. So, money is going to be a problem.\"\n\nDuring the lockdown, Joseph rented a small partition within a shop in order to sell clothes, but he says he had to close the business down because he doesn't have time for it when school is in session.\n\nHowever, at least for the moment, the 17-year-old feels that he is on track to pursue a career as a mechanical engineer specializing in robotics. At his school's science fair, he submitted two entries — a toy missile launcher vehicle and a bag that can charge a mobile phone on the go. \"When the judges made their choice,\" he says proudly, \"I won the title 'Mr. Creative.' \"\n\nHalima Athumani is a digital and broadcast journalist based in Kampala, Uganda.

    "Uganda parliament considers organ transplant revolution": "The Ugandan Parliament is considering a bill that would make it possible for the first time to perform organ transplants in this East African country. A small revolution that would transform the lives of thousands of people waiting for surgery.\n\nIf the legislation is approved, Uganda will join African countries such as South Africa, Tunisia, and Kenya, which already have the regulations and health facilities in place to allow organ transplants to take place in their countries.\n\nIndia and Turkey are currently the most popular destinations for Ugandan kidney patients. Only close relatives are allowed to be donors and travel must be approved by the Uganda Medical Council - to avoid organ trafficking or people being forced to offer their organs.\n\nIf Parliament approves the new measure, the process should be simpler and the cost of surgery and recovery could be reduced to about $8,000 instead of $30,000 for a transplant abroad.\n\nProponents of the measure say Uganda needs special legislation to create a safe framework, subject to strict regulation, to ensure there is no abuse. Among them is Dr. Kharya, from the Centre for Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy in India. According to him, Uganda already has a good base in terms of a blood bank and laboratories.\n\nThe proposal calls for the creation of a national waiting list of organ recipients and the establishment of specialized transplant centers throughout the country. An operating theatre has already been set up at the main national hospital in Mulago, Kampala.\n\nOrgan banks will also be established for those who wish to donate, not just kidneys.",

    "Uganda condemns EU resolution slamming oil pipeline": "**Uganda slammed a resolution by the European Union’s Parliament calling for a halt to extractive activities in protected ecosystems in an oil pipeline project. The Deputy Speaker of the Ugandan National assembly slammed a \"deliberate misrepresentation of key facts\" in the resolution.\n\n**\n\nBy 2025, Uganda will have its oil coming out of the East Africa Crude Oil Pipeline as planned. The comments of leader Yoweri Museni reaffirmed his determination to have the project completed.\n\nHis reaction came Friday following a resolution by the European Union’s Parliament urging the international community \"to exert maximum pressure on Ugandan and Tanzanian authorities, as well as the project promoters and stakeholders,\" to stop oil activities around Lake Albert.\n\nUganda is estimated to have recoverable oil reserves of at least 1.4 billion barrels. In February, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation and TotalEnergies said that the total investment would be more than $10 billion. They have partnered with the Uganda National Oil Company, and the Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation\n\nThe national assembly issued a statement asserting Uganda’s sovereignty and condemning the EU parliament’s resolution. \"The resolution is based on misinformation and deliberate misrepresentation of key facts on environment and human rights protection. It represents the highest level on neo-colonialism and imperialism against the sovereignty of Uganda and Tanzania\", Thomas Tayebwa, the Deputy speaker of the assembly said.\n\nKampala says oil wealth can lift millions. When environmental Ngos like Friends of the Earth evaluated that over one hundred twenty thousand people will lose land to make way for the project.\n\nUnfair compensation\n\nCompensation was also an issue. If Ugandan civil society had already voiced that disclosed compensation was not fair, the resolution doubled down. Saying that some landowners \"had their homes destroyed to facilitate the construction of access roads or the processing plant, others have had all or part of their land requisitioned and have lost the free use of their properties and thus their means of subsistence, without prior payment of fair and adequate compensation; whereas the compensation paid is often far too low to allow farmers whose land has been expropriated to buy comparable land on which to continue farming [...]\". It, therefore, called for the authorities to \"compensate promptly, fairly, and adequately, as provided for in the Ugandan Constitution and as promised by the companies\" , \"those evicted or denied access to their land\" and \"people [who] lost property and land\".\n\nThe text also expressed its \"grave concern about the human rights violations in Uganda and Tanzania linked to investments in fossil-fuel projects, including the wrongful imprisonment of human rights defenders, the arbitrary suspension of NGOs, arbitrary prison sentences\".\n\nMuseveni said TotalEnergies had assured him that the pipeline — which would link oil fields in western Uganda to the Indian Ocean port of Tanga in Tanzania — would proceed but warned on Twitter that \"if the French energy group was to choose to listen to the EU Parliament, Uganda shall find another partner.\"",

    "Unlocking press freedom in Uganda: What must be done": "In 2018, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) global press freedom index placed Uganda 125th out of 180 nations—a grim rank the country held for three consecutive years.\n\nBy 2022, the East African nation of more than 44 million people had nosedived seven places as practitioners in Uganda’s fourth pillar of democracy continued to be threatened with a record overt and covert forms of repression from State actors.\n\nNow, the nation’s status of independent journalism falls far away from RSF’s description of free press. RSF defines media freedom as “the effective possibility for journalists, as individuals and as groups, to select, produce and disseminate news and information in the public interest, independently from political, economic, legal and social interference, and without threats to their physical and mental safety.”\n\nReturn to democratic path\n\nWith Uganda’s media freedom shrinking, her journalism has found a grim position contrary to the suggestion of Marxist philosopher Antonio Gramsci, who postulates that “history teaches, but has no pupils.”\n\nIn this case, a pupil of Uganda’s media historiography, fourth-year journalism and communication student at Makerere University, Ms Belinda Birungi, is “extremely scared to go missing once admitted into media practice.”\n\n“I am fearful of police and army brutality. Besides, they’re many grey areas in our Constitution that can be used against you,” says the 22-year-old Ugandan.\n\nEndless crackdowns on media houses have subdued the likes of Ms Birungi to self-censorship.\n\n“Security forces have snatched our courage to present the wrongs of society… I mean the courage to write objectively,” said Ms Birungi, who was interning at the country’s leading independent newspaper, Daily Monitor, at the time of this publication.\n\nBetween coming to terms with a brutal state capture of the media and surviving, Ms Birungi “prefers other things to becoming part of over 40 journalists killed globally every year.”\n\nIn reply to Ms Birungi’s concerns, the head of postgraduate journalism studies at Uganda Christian University (UCU), Ms Annette Kezaabu, underscores that “harassment and criminal sanctions are dangerous to journalism.”\n\nShe adds that one way of dealing with this is to ensure “cases of journalists should be handled as civil wrongs like in most liberal societies.”\n\nAlthough enshrined under Articles 29 and 41 of the Ugandan Constitution, repeated violation of press freedoms, profoundly by security forces, has raised questions over what appears to be a crisis of legitimacy.\n\nBut Kezaabu, who also leads the Uganda Pornography Control Committee at the Ethics and Integrity Ministry, says “the laws in place are sufficient and don’t require a constitutional rewrite.”\n\n“We should use the laws to tighten where security has made inroads, but there are things that we don’t talk about that are maybe an error of compromised journalists,” she says, adding, “Journalists must abide by accepted ethos for their freedom’s sake.”\n\nKezaabu, however, admits that interpretation or application of the law against journalists may be one-sided to suit the wishes of its enforcers or the jury.\n\n“There’s need to return the country to a democratic path to safeguard human freedom, including the one of expression,” she urges.\n\nFurther, Kezaabu acknowledges that use of anti-terrorism laws and a litany of other decrees against free speech are a clear loop of claw-back clauses in the Constitution.\n\n“It is incumbent upon media houses and journalists to know when not to overstep their mandate to avoid clashing with authorities by, for instance, promoting nudity,” she advises.\n\nArriving at a similar argument, Aga Khan University School of Media and Communications graduate lecturer Alex Taremwa “believes without social responsibility to audiences, the media lose the values that make their duty to society important.”\n\nMr Taremwa argues that breaching the universally known media mandate and standards may instantly birth the horrors that have defined the industry in the eyes of individuals like Ms Birungi.\n\nNew business models\n\nOne of the other challenges press freedom in Uganda faces is that there are more than 200 radio stations and more than 30 televisions in Uganda. The number is impressive. At least superficially. Nearly 70 percent of these stations are, however, owned by either deep state or legislators, according to an African Centre for Media Excellence 2022 survey.\n\n“They control the broadcast narrative and that breaks journalism’s will to mirror society,” observes 2019 BBC Komla Dumar award-winning investigative journalist Solomon Sserwanja.\n\nTo evade the proprietor censorship oriented by political and commercial interests, Mr Sserwanja moots alternative business models to run media operations.\n\n“…for instance, media houses can go after full subscription and run away from advertisers whose commercial advertising interests may force media houses to filter serious stories,” he told this publication on September 6.\n\nFair pay for journalists\n\nThe ability for journalists to report freely is also hampered, for many reasons, by the poor pay journalists are given. In Uganda, pay cheques of journalists have steadied below $200 (about Shs760,000) per month amid lack of newsroom investment by media moguls.\n\nAt least each senior editor contacted from five different (both) state and private media houses reasons that “equipping reporters is an essentiality for free press in a digital evolution.”\n\nFor 25-year-old Soft Power News journalist and digital assistant Muhamadi Byemboijana, “press freedom starts internally with employers ensuring fair pay for journalists.”\n\nHe adds: “Some press corps are battered because the tormentors have no respect for their low paying profession.”\n\nIn addition to that, because of the poor pay, many journalists will take bribes to manage the cost of living. A Ugandan journalist, who preferred anonymity, on September 7 confessed to accepting a “small bribe to kill a story.”\n\n“I killed a match fixing story involving the national cricket team because I felt unprotected, including by the media house I work for. Eventually, I accepted pay from the sports fixers,” the television sports scribe said in an interview.\n\nThis is why fair pay, although it might be a difficult subject to talk about, must be looked into to allow journalists do their work well. Mr Taremwa, in agreement of this, states that “like any other [human] right, good pay definitely increases the quality of freedom-enjoyment and eliminates the threat of bribery or blackmail, which endangers one’s journalistic autonomy.”\n\nCivic engagement\n\nAnother challenge to press freedom is the fact that the audiences for whom they write may not be critically aware of the role of the media.\n\nOver the last two decades, several media houses have emerged in almost all Ugandan regions—usually with screaming headlines critical of the State, signalling the possibility that media freedom has made some gains to be preserved.\n\nHowever, by 2013, an absolute militaristic approach under the Museveni presidency had outpaced his classical conservative National Resistance Army (NRA) post-guerilla war promise of a “free press” in 1986.\n\n“The public cannot say it enjoys freedom if information is being hidden from them. To move our press freedom higher than like 65 percent, awareness should be created in the public domain regarding the fundamental importance of journalism,” Kezaabu says.\n\nTo protect what he describes as his endangered freedom on duty, Mbale City-based Step FM talk show host Eric Mwasame, 30, wants “journalism recognised as a fundamental pillar of development.”\n\n“Society, especially politicians, take us as people who fight governments or mere antagonists, which is untrue. That should change,” Mr Mwasame says.\n\nSimilarly, Kampala City resident Peninah Rukundo singles out “civic engagement as a crucial enabler of free speech.”\n\nWhile the challenges to press freedom remain, some of these solutions can begin to pave the way for a media that is able to do its job robustly, which in turn provides the nation a good service.\n\nForming associations\n\nFor many professions, associations help push their agenda and enable them to have a listening ear from the powers that be. In the case of the media, however, a tiny sliver of Uganda’s hundreds of journalists subscribe to press associations that largely exist only in name in a complex political environment. This has discouraged many from joining them.\n\n“I want to know what these associations are doing for journalism by their actions and then I’d join them,” freelance journalist Daniel Emukule, 39, reacts when asked why he’s not conformist to any press association.\n\nWorryingly also, the near absence of Fourth Estate unions—as tens of journalists are continuously persecuted—has compelled at least eight out of 10 reporters interviewed by this newspaper on September 7 to describe existing press associations as “state-linked and inoperative.”\n\nForming strong and respected media unions and, or associations would, therefore, provide much needed support.\n\n“In areas where relative press freedom exists, working associations are vocal against injustices targeting journalists and that’s why vibrant ones are essential for press freedom,” the head of postgraduate journalism studies at Uganda Christian University (UCU), Ms Annette Kezaabu, emphasises.\n\nMr Sserwanja, 35, who left his job at a top media house in Uganda to become chief executive officer at the African Institute for Investigative Journalism (AIIJ), holds that the country needs more such establishments that protect threatened media practitioners.\n\n“All of us (stakeholders) have a role to play to better journalism in this country. The future of journalism relies on collaborations by entities that lead conversations against media repression,” he says.",
    "Uganda, Tanzania and Rwanda force France to deal with them like partners and not former colonies": "The Scramble for Africa is a term used for the events that happened during the period between 1881 and 1914. In this short period of time the Western European powers colonized most of Africa. Europeans controlled a mere 10 percent of Africa by 1970 and by 1914 they controlled roughly 90 percent of Africa with Ethiopia (Abyssinia) and Liberia remaining independent. Although France later invaded Ethiopia and captured it for 5 years (1936 to 1941).\n\nThe question here is why we are talking about the Scramble for Africa?\n\nIts answer lies in recent talks hosted by France on Rwanda and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) relations.\n\nMacron hosts talks on DRC and Rwanda tensions\n\nRecently President Emmanuel Macron hosted talks between Rwandan President Paul Kagame and DRC’s President Felix Tshisekedi amid tensions between the two East-African neighbors regarding rebel problems on their common border.\n\nOn the sidelines of UNGA at Newyork, Macron hosted this meeting to solve the problem of M23 rebels which are wreaking havoc in Democratic Republic of Congo. The President of DRC has also denounced at tha UNGA that the M23 rebels are backed by Rwanda. He also asked the UN to support the African-led mediation.\n\n#RDC_Rwanda_France #UNGA77 I 21.09.2022 #NewYork\n\nCommuniqué conjoint de la Rencontre trilatérale #RDC #Rwanda #France\n\nA l’initiative du Président Emmanuel Macron, les Présidents Félix Tshisekedi, et Paul Kagame, se sont entretenus ce mercredi 21/09/22 à New York. pic.twitter.com/f6fmDmiMoP — Présidence RDC 🇨🇩 (@Presidence_RDC) September 21, 2022\n\nThe state-owned France 24 quoted the French Presidency as saying; The three leaders together “noted their concerns about the resurgence of violence in the east of the DRC,”\n\nUganda and Tanzania oil pipeline and its strategic importance\n\nThe focal point here is the controversial East-African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) which will be the largest heated oil pipeline in the world when constructed. The $10 billion project includes French energy giant TotalEnergies, Uganda National Oil Company (UNOC) and Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC) and other minority shareholders as well. The project includes transportation of oil from Lake Albert to Tanzanian port city.\n\nThe oil will be drilled from the Lake Albert basin on the border of Uganda and Democratic Republic of Congo which was first found by a British oil company Tullow Oil in 2006. In April 2020, Tullow oil sold its stake to TotalEnergies and it took almost two years for the French multinational to secure investors for the project.\n\nNear Lake Albert the project developers will together construct oil wells, a crude oil refining plant, underground oil pipelines and other infrastructure in the districts of Nwoya and Bullisa for domestic oil utilization.\n\nThe stakeholders in the EACOP include TotalEnergies (62%), UNOC (15%), Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation TPDC (15%) and CNOOC (8%).\n\nAs per the claims by the investors the EACOP will generate approximately 14,000 direct and 45,000 indirect jobs during the construction and production phases with $1.7 billion worth of business creation for the local contractors.\n\n(Extraction and transportation of oil through EACOP, Source: Global oil and Gas exit list)\n\nThe West which together (EU and USA) accounts for 32% of greenhouse emissions as compared to Africa which is 3.8% is today despising African countries for constructing oil pipelines citing Environmental concerns. The IMF recently suggested the African countries to slow down on macroeconomic reforms, which can be summed up as suggesting the African nations to “stay poor forever”.\n\nAnd when the whole West altogether is after Africa scrambling for its resources, Tanzania and Uganda together chose France to give its project’s construction responsibilities. They both effectively forced France to come to the table as equal partner and not as high-handed master. African nations such as Tanzania know that France in general and EU in particular are in dire need of energy and are taking full advantage of the ongoing EU and Russia sanction-energy powerplay.\n\nFrance forced to recognise African countries as Equal Partners\n\nIt is pertinent to note that the EU is struggling with an energy crisis in the aftermath of the Ukraine-Russia conflict. The energy crisis is so severe that the EU has to resort to burning wood to meet its energy demands. But France’s strategic move to invite the Presidents of DRC and Rwanda for lunch on the sidelines of UNGA is to secure its foothold in the region. France acting as a mediator in resolving the conflict between the DRC and Rwanda will help it secure its energy needs, whether they are oil or gas.\n\nAll these turn of events have proven the point that gone are the days in which the borders of African countries were decided in European capitals. This move of Macron can set an example for other European powers that they have to get out of their colonial slumber and start treating African countries as equal partners and not as the subjects of former colonies.\n\nStaying in Africa is not easy\n\nIt is a well-documented phenomenon that in today’s Africa, no power can stay if the people of Africa are not in its support. The non-state actors and other disturbing elements in most of the countries make it impossible for any foreign power to even establish its presence. China tried to gain a foothold on Africa by using its cheque-book diplomacy but failed miserably. It is estimated that China spent $148 billion between 2000 and 2018 in loans to African countries which has made it the biggest bilateral lender in Africa. Despite spending almost 150 billion dollars China failed to gather support in the African continent.\n\nLearning from the past mistakes of European powers and recent blunders of the Chinese, France has come up with a solid plan which includes treating the African countries with respect and not like masters. Still the European powers which sanction countries on the drop of a hat, need to learn the lesson that if they keep African countries as former colonies, the African nations will never come on their side.",

    "Nyege Nyege music festival in Uganda is back on – but morality police are watching": "First staged in 2015, the globally touted Nyege Nyege Festival in Uganda is a four-day dance party and a major tourism drawcard that caters to lovers of electronic dance music. After a three-year break due to COVID-19, the 2022 festival is taking place from 15-18 September in Uganda. Over 300 deejays and performers will participate across seven stages, with 10,000 revellers expected to attend. But Nyege Nyege nearly didn’t happen. Uganda’s parliament banned it – and not for the first time – on the grounds that it promotes “sexual immorality”. Eventually the prime minister gave it the go-ahead. Tourism lecturer Amos Ochieng has studied the festival and explains its ongoing dilemma.\n\nWhy is Nyege Nyege so controversial?\n\nThe festival promotes electronic dance music and was established by promoters Arlen Dilsizian and Derek Debru to meet the demand among young Ugandans for all-night dance partying. Even though Nyege Nyege is promoting the theme of environmental conservation and inclusivity this year, it has been the subject of moral outrage and heated debate. The controversy has a lot to do with its name – Nyege Nyege – and the choice of a large new location at the banks of the Nile river, at Itanda Falls, a venue reportedly five times larger than before.\n\nIn the Luganda language of Uganda, “nyege nyege” is interpreted as an irresistible urge to dance. One dictionary defnition says it means “an intensive feeling for the urgency in need for intimacy, closure and physical exploration”. However, in the Kiswahili language of the larger region, “nyege nyege” is slang for “horny, horny” and is used in relation to sexual urges. As a contemporary and popular musical event, Nyege Nyege is, according to one study, intended to “create intense and affective aesthetic experiences for its participants”.\n\nDuring a recent parliamentary session a member of parliament ardently argued for its cancellation. Parliamentarians, religious and opinion leaders, human rights activists and some government officials have publicly questioned the integrity of the event. They believe it is a breeding ground for sexual immorality. The Speaker of the Ugandan parliament declared it banned just over a week before it was to be held.\n\nControversially, in just less than 24 hours, an emergency meeting chaired by the prime minister cleared the event to take place. She argued that it was too late to cancel as thousands of tourists were expected for the festival. A banning would cause financial losses. She assured the public that the event would take place under strict guidelines, including no underage guests and no nudity.\n\nThe roots of the resistance to the festival lie in the fact that Uganda is a conservative country with a strong position of Christian morality and a wish to preserve “traditional values”. Homosexuality, for example, is outlawed in the country under a law inherited from the British during the colonial period. The Sexual Offences Bill of 2021 criminalises same-sex relations, sex work and a range of other offences.\n\nIn 2018, the Nyege Nyege Festival was cancelled by Uganda’s ethics and integrity minister on moral grounds but was later cleared to continue. This could be seen as part of government’s commitment to turn Ugandan music and local entertainment into economic goods forming a core part of the creative tourism industry segment. After all, the production of specialised music has a cohesive role in creating local identities and touristic images and products. These can be promoted and marketed to diversify Uganda’s tourism product base.\n\nThe key challenge, though, is that these controversies only mirror the lack of coordination between government departments and agencies. This is the seventh edition of the event. Why should responsible authorities wait until just a few days to the event before raising concerns? If the event can potentially destroy cultures, why not come up with a clear policy and ban it completely or modify it? There is an urgent need for Uganda to develop regulatory guidelines instead of being reactionary.\n\nWhat role does the festival play for tourism?\n\nMusic and dance are a growing part of the creative tourism industry. Like other festivals and cultural displays they are part of the everyday spaces of leisure, a source of artistic expression and audience pleasure.\n\nRegarding the current controversy, I would think that organisers and enthusiasts are actually loving it. There are indications that they are getting free publicity in mainstream and social media. The ping-pong game by the government appears to create increased curiosity and the #NyegeNyege hashtag has been trending on social platforms. Uganda has one of the youngest populations in the world and young Ugandans are strongly influenced by social media.\n\nAllowing Nyege Nyege to continue also reflects Uganda’s preparedness to handle large numbers of tourists in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. The event will provide opportunities for the sale of locally produced materials for improved local livelihoods. As an opportunity for cross-cultural interactions, Ugandan cultures could feature prominently.\n\nThe electronic dance music community is a new niche with enthusiastic promoters recruiting new members to build a like-minded community. This community boasts diverse audiences with diverse artistic tastes and consists of smaller (local, translocal or virtual) groups of musicians, fans, promoters and the like.\n\nSo the festival is a growing leisure activity in Uganda with a moral dilemma.\n\nWhat is the future for an event like Nyege Nyege?\n\nUganda, with its strong religious and cultural foundation, will continue to challenge the promotion of Nyege Nyege.\n\nLocal music articulates issues around identity, conformity, performance, status, community, subculture, high culture, technology, power relations, education, place and space. How best can all these aspects be integrated to embrace the electronic dance music community for a sustainable tourism industry in Uganda – while still preserving the sanctity of cultural values?\n\nThe government departments and agencies responsible for tourism should work with the organisers to draw the best alternatives to promote and conduct the event, and still preserve our cultures. Unless they do, I expect that the event will continue to receive backlash.",

    "Bedford netball star earns maiden international call up for Uganda series": "22-year old Ellie Rattu, already an England youth player and a star of London Pulse franchise, has been granted her first full international call up for a three-match series against Uganda in October.\n\nRattu is already an England international at youth level, having played for the Under-17’s, Under-19’s and the Roses but is now in line to make her full debut against the world’s seventh ranked side.\n\nThe three match series takes place at Nottingham’s Motorpoint Arena and London’s Copper Box Arena, a location familiar with Rattu, where she plays franchise netball for London Pulse.\n\n“Don’t you find out now?”\n\nMost players are on edge finding out if they’ve made the cut for their first international call up, but the atmosphere in the Rattu household seemed fairly relaxed on finding out the news.\n\n“I think I was in bed and my Mum came in and said, ‘Oh, don’t you find out now?’ And I was like, ‘No, Mum, not yet.’\n\n“And then I checked my phone, and it was there. So I had to go back downstairs and say that I had found out.”\n\nEllie is no stranger to the big occasion; she has competed in the sport’s first ever franchise league with London Pulse, making 38 appearances for the Pulse since their inception in 2019.\n\nDespite the meteoric rise to success, Ellie is under no illusions to the tough nature of the challenge in front of her, accepting she will have to be patient for her chances.\n\n“I think being on tours from Under-17 and Under-19’s with England and the Roses Academy definitely prepares you for understanding what it’s like to be away from home for that period of time and being in camp for a long period of time. All you are doing is netball,” she explained.\n\n“So I think that’s been really, really beneficial. But I think it’s always going to be a shock going up to international standard.\n\n“It’s not like playing your age group, it’s the top dogs, it’s the best in the world.\n\n“It’s definitely going to be a shock to the system, but hopefully one that I can manage.”\n\nCoverage on Sky Sports\n\nThe three-match series is due to be covered by Sky Sports from 5th to 9th October, with Rattu hopeful of making an appearance.\n\nHer game has improved under the tutelage of London Pulse Performance Director, Lisa Alexander, hugely experienced in the netball world after nine years as head coach of the Australian Diamonds.\n\n“She just is very good at talking about the little one percenters,” said Rattu of Alexander.\n\n“You know that it’s not just on court, it’s everything that builds up around that.\n\n“So it’s how you prepare, your sleep, your mindset and everything else. So I think it’s learning those sorts of things off the court and how they will then translate on court as well.\n\n“But equally all the technical work that we’ve done with Pulse in the past couple of years, those connections, a lot of the girls from Pulse are playing this series, so having connections should prove helpful on court.”\n\nWhatever transpires for Ellie in October, her rise through the ranks are sure to see her don the England jersey at some point in the future, however, all in Bedford will be keeping their fingers crossed for October.\n\nEngland have already beaten Uganda this year; securing a semi-final spot in the Commonwealth Games with a 56-35 win against the African side before losing to Australia in the last four.\n\nTickets to see the Vitality Roses in action against Uganda are still available from the England Netball website.",

    "The tragedy of Bobi Wine": "How the ideological poverty of Uganda’s leading opposition figure makes him subversive to our national interest\n\nTHE LAST WORD | ANDREW M. MWENDA | Uganda’s leading opposition figure, Robert Kyagulanyi, hereinafter referred to by his stage name, Bobi Wine, is a disaster of unmitigated proportions. He claims to be opposed to the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP). I wonder whether he even knows what this project is about and the length to which the governments of Uganda and Tanzania and the International Oil Companies (IOCs) went to ensure that all social and environmental issues pertaining to this project are addressed. For a person who aspires to lead Uganda, Bobi Wine comes across as not just ignorant and reckless, but also dangerously subversive to Uganda’s interests.\n\nBobi Wine and that army of emotional desperados who rally around him have legitimate grievances against the government of President Yoweri Museveni. Many of them have been unfairly and unjustly jailed without trial, tortured in illegal detention facilities and killed. Sometimes their only crime has been to voice opposition to the government. I feel their pain and stand with them on those grievances. However, to use these grievances to join forces with foreign groups hostile to our vital national interests is unforgivable. Museveni is a transient figure in Uganda’s politics and the clock is ticking towards the evening of his stay. But Uganda will stay here forever.\n\nHere are the facts about Uganda’s oil sector, which I think Museveni and his government, have handled well. Government has gone to great length to ensure that the exploitation of Uganda’s oil meets the best international environmental, legal and social standards. We have two oil areas. Tilenga is the northern field between Nwoya and Buliisa districts. They have two blocks which will produce most of the crude oil, about 190,000 barrels per day. The key assets are a) the wells that will produce the crude and b) the central processing facility that will clean up the crude by separating water, gas and other impurities like mud. Once cleaned it is put in c) a pipeline that will transport it from the fields to Hoima. The idea is that all the crude will be gathered in Hoima and the EACOP will begin from there. Then there is a Kingfisher, which is in the southern fields and the process is the same as above.\n\nFor each of these facilities, detailed Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) was done. The ESIA looks at the environmental impacts that the project will cause. Once the impact is identified, you seek to avoid certain impacts and those that cannot be avoided you work to mitigate. For instance, some of the wells in Tilenga are in the national park where wild animals reside. When drilling a rig, it makes a lot of noise. To mitigate this, government and IOCs will bring in a silent rig that will drill without noise.\n\nThe ESIA report is then taken to the district for its officials, civil society and academia to see the avoidance and mitigation measures agreed on and make comments. Then public hearings are held and people come and make their contribution. Once this information is gathered, the report is improved and submitted to NEMA. Then their experts study the report, make comments and sit with IOCs and UNOC representing government and negotiate the final changes to make to the documents. It is after this that NEMA approves the document and gives you a certificate that you begin implement the ESIA.\n\nThen in come the financing institutions – these include export credit agencies, development finance institutions, commercial banks and insurance companies. These are sensitive to environmental and social issues. Especially banks want to avoid risks. They send their experts – independent auditors in the field who audit the resettlement action plan, the legal regime, the technical design of the production and processing facilities etc. In Uganda’s case, these found Uganda’s ESIAs to be among the best in the world and the projects passed on all aspects. For EACOP, the project is oversubscribed by financiers at 120% – proof that Uganda has done an excellent job.\n\nThe law that Uganda has deals with carbon emissions from the project. Uganda has a law that bans flaring. When you produce crude oil, it comes with, among other things, gas. If you separate gas, you must find something to do with it. In many countries, they just burn it (flaring). But this emits a lot of carbon. Uganda decided not to burn the gas but will convert it into Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) and Uganda will be producing 100,000 metric tons per year. Currently, the consumption of LPG in Uganda today is only 25,000 tons per year.\n\nThe pipeline will need to be heated. Initially the plan was to use crude to heat the pipeline. This would generate a lot of carbon. It was decided to build four solar farms to generate electricity for 80% of the pipeline. The other 20% will be heated by power imported from the Ugandan grid, which is 80% hydro. UNOC will plant 40 million trees which is aimed at offsetting the carbon that the project will generate that will not have been offset by the clean energy. Total is also planting 100,000 trees. Effectively the project will be almost as carbon neutral as it can get. This has lasted years.\n\nThe resettlement plan has also been audited and approved by experts and found to meet international standards. Once the route was identified, governments of Uganda and Tanzania and IOCs went and met with all those people to be affected by the project. In terms of numbers (Uganda side), there are 3,648 project affected persons in the ten districts. Of these, only 4% are going to be required to be relocated, and these can choose to be given cash compensation or have a new home built for them.\n\nFor those who have chosen cash compensation, every district has a committee that independently establishes the rates for their assets – house, trees, crops etc. This is on top of the value of the land. The chief government valuer supervises this process and ensures that values are harmonised across the districts. After this, the government hired Centenary Bank to go to the villages to do financial literacy training. People were trained, they opened bank accounts and compensation is now at 60%. Government has also added a disturbance allowance of 30%. And for most of the project affected persons, government has added a 15% uplift allowance for delays. This same process was also conducted in Tanzania where it was easier because their land tenure system is simpler. So what exactly is Bobi Wine’s concern?\n\n****\n\namwenda@independent.co.ug",

    "Uganda: Farmers switch to organic fertilizers as price of chemical hikes": "As is customary, Joseph Wagodoma is on his way to his patch of land in Kayunga, central Uganda. If the farmer and his wife are used to tending their bean garden, somehting has changed for the couple. In the past few months, the yhave switched to organic fertilizers. Like many food producers, they are hit by global shortage in crop fertilizers caused by sanctions on Russia, bad weather and cuts in export.\n\n\"What inspired me to turn to organic fertilizer was the price of chemical fertilizer, Wagodoma says. I had no other source of money to continue with it. The small harvests we were getting would only cater for basic household needs, so by the start of the planting season, you have no money for fertilizers to prepare your garden with.\"\n\nAbout 15 km away from Joseph's farm, workers are collecting a organic waste delivery in a Kampala warehouse. The Marula Proteen company spearheads the organic fertilizer initiative.\n\nThe company's CEO and founder Tommie Hooft explains how the process works: \"We shred all the waste we ferment it in drums and the fermentation makes the waste soft and then the soft waste is fed to our maggots for a period of 7 to 8 days. The maggots that eat it their enzymes consume it they are breaking down all the waste. and in the essence the larva poo is the fertilizer and it is similar to what happens in nature, in nature some thing dies and it rots and it gets eaten by maggots and then it goes into the soil, so that's the process we are mimicking.\"\n\nA rapidly scaling project\n\nWhen the idea of ProTeen was born in late 2017 in the brains of the CEO and his advisor Ludivine Berouard, they were preoccupied by the animal feed and sustainability challenges Ugandan farmers faced.\n\nThey discovered that \"poultry farmers [were] no longer able to access fishmeal, their primary source of poultry feed\" because of \"overfishing in Lake Victoria which [had led] to reduced availability, high cost and low quality of fishmeal\".\n\nAccording to Food and Agriculture Organization, Russia stood as the world’s top exporter of nitrogen fertilizers, the second leading supplier of potassium fertilizers and the third largest exporter of phosphorous fertilizers. The consequences of the Russia-Ukraine conflict have turned the tables and ProTeen's mission has become more necessary as ever.\n\n\"30 to 40 % of the total chemical fertilizer available isn't there anymore and Europe needs it, Brazil needs it, the U.S. needs it, Tommie Hooft says. It is going to places other than Uganda other than Africa. So in our case we don't just have the opportunity to sell organic fertilizer we also have an opportunity to teach farmers how to use organic and start managing their farms in a more organic way.\"\n\nMarula Proteen has also partenered with residents who farm the short-lived but fertile insect. The company provides farmers with 5-day-old larvae that they rear to generate their own fertilizers.\n\nMuhammad Magezi a worker with Marula Proteen, says since the introduction of the black soldier fly initiative, farming communities are rushing to adopt the method. \"We are receiving a lot of positive feedback from our farmers because in the beginning before the introduction of this technology they used to use synthetic fertilizers which are more expensive on market and BSF black soldier fly rearing provides a cheaper alternative\", Magezi reveals.\n\nMarula Proteen prides itseft of providing a clean and safe fertilizer which can improve the soil.\n\nLarvae farming programs exist in countries including Nigeria and Kenya.",

Twelve participants from the Field,\n\nArea, and Country Offices attended the training.\n\n• The training helped strengthening their capacity by giving them foundational guidance on PSEA and gender-based violence and assisting them in reviewing their terms of reference to understand roles and responsibilities.\n\nAgriculture and Market Support (AMS)\n\n• Agriculture and Market Support (AMS) and Supply Chain (SC) together with a team from the Regional Office Nairobi and Head Quarters carried out a price transmission study to determine the factors behind prevailing bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and imbalances that prevent smallholder farmers and other actors from benefiting from local and regional food procurement. The following ten districts participated in the study: Kampala, Mubende, Mityana,\n\nKamwenge, Kikuube, Kiryandongo, Kitagwenda, Kyegegwa,\n\nKyenjojo, and Masindi. Results from the study will guide the implementation of the Local and Regional Food Policy and the introduction of the traceability tool.\n\n• AMS continued to build the capacity of the smallholder farmers, both refugees, and nationals, to transform their groups into agri-businesses. The focus here is on supporting the development of farmers' business plans, linking them to buyers as well as food safety and quality, and taking advantage of the various emerging markets in the country.\n\nStrengthening national capacity for Emergency Preparedness and Response\n\n• In July 2022, WFP partnered with Excel Hort – a consultant Agribusiness Incubator to support the establishment of two incubation hubs in Southwestern Uganda.

    "Access to Clean Energy for refugees Uganda Case Studies - Uganda": "INTRODUCTION\n\nProvision of clean and affordable energy is a catalyst for sustainable development in all countries of the world. Access to energy increases safety, improves the provision of health services, enhances access to education and economic opportunities.\n\nRefugees worldwide face great challenges accessing energy. But innovative interventions by the humanitarian sector, together with affected communities, host governments, UN country teams, and a wide range of partners from various sectors, can improve access to energy.\n\nUNHCR’s Global Strategy for Sustainable Energy 2019- 2025 aims to enable refugees, hosts communities and other persons of concern to meet their energy needs in a safe and sustainable manner, while also addressing health, protection and environmental concerns rising from access to energy. In line with the existing framework, UNHCR has adopted the World Health Organization (WHO) definition of clean energy based on the impact on health. Fuel and technologies are considered clean only if they achieve WHO targets for particle matter (PM) and carbon monoxide (CO) emission. In addition, UNHCR defines the use of biomass in combination with improved technologies while moving as a transitional solution while moving towards more sustainable and cleaner practices.\n\nThe UNHCR energy strategy is part of the actions and parameters set in the Operational strategy for climate resilience and environmental sustainability 2022-2025, to respond to the growing global climate emergency. Guided by the Strategic Framework for Climate Action (SFCA), UNHCR focuses on mitigating the impact of cli- mate change and environmental degradation on forcibly displaced people and their host communities, sup- porting sustainability by preserving and rehabilitating the natural environment in displacement settings and minimizing the environmental footprint of humanitarian assistance.\n\nThis report presents case studies of clean and transitional energy interventions in refugee settlements implemented by UNHCR and partners in Uganda. Energy-related approaches from these case studies can be adapted and replicated in other refugee-hosting countries, as a means of meeting basic needs of people in displacement, improving their well-being and, when possible, creating sustainable livelihood opportunities through the provision of energy. The following case studies are based on experiences in refugee situations but can be adapted to internal displacement situations as well.\n\nInnovative interventions [...] can transform the lives of those who've been forcibly displaced, helping them to build better futures for themselves and their families."
