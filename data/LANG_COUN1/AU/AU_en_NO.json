    "2 more arrests in deadly attack during Norway Pride festival": "Two more suspects have been arrested in connection to a deadly shooting during the Norwegian capital’s annual LGBTQ Pride festival\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Two more suspects have been arrested in connection with a deadly shooting during the Norwegian capital’s annual LGBTQ Pride festival, police said Monday. The total number of suspects is now at four.\n\nA 42-year-old Norwegian citizen originally from Iran was arrested shortly after the June shootings in Oslo’s nightlife district that killed two people and wounded more than 20. A second Norwegian man in his 40s is being sought, police said Friday.\n\nOn Monday, police said two more suspects — a man in his 40s with Somali citizenship and a Norwegian national in his 30s — were arrested Sunday. Both are known to the police, authorities said, adding that they are residents of Oslo.\n\nThey faces preliminary charges of “complicity in an act of terrorism,” police said.\n\nThe suspect who has not yet been detained, Arfan Bhatti, is believed to be in Pakistan. Norwegian police said that, “to ensure the best possible cooperation with the Pakistani authorities, we had officials from the Oslo police district in Pakistan a short time ago. ”\n\nBhatti allegedly posted online statements about killing gay people. Media reports said he knew Zaniar Matapour, the main suspect in the June 25 attack that the Norwegian Police Security Service has called an “Islamist terror act.”\n\nMatapour who according to Norwegian media arrived in Norway with his family from a Kurdish part of Iran in the 1990s, faces preliminary charges of murder and attempted murder.\n\nThe names of the suspects arrested Sunday were not given.",
    "New Polish gas pipeline from Norway to reach full capacity ahead of schedule": "Poland’s new pipeline bringing Norwegian gas via Denmark and through the Baltic Sea – which is due to open this week – will be able to transport up to twice as much gas as previously planned this year due to the faster-than-expected progress of work.\n\nThe Baltic Pipe, which is seen as a key element in Poland’s diversification away from Russian energy sources, is due to begin transporting gas this Saturday, 1 October, with an initial capacity equivalent to 2-3 billion cubic metres (bmc) per year.\n\nIt was then expected to reach its full capacity of 10 bcm of gas per year at the start of 2023. However, on Saturday Danish gas system operator Energinet announced that work “is progressing so well” that full capacity is due to be reached by the end of November this year.\n\n“We are pleased to announce that a major part of the vast project has [already] been completed and is ready for use,” said Torben Brabo, Energinet’s director of international relations.\n\n“Due to an extraordinary effort on the part of everyone involved, we were able to lay the remaining pipelines faster than expected,” he added. “Full commissioning can therefore take place ahead of time.”\n\nLater on Saturday, the Polish government’s commissioner for strategic energy infrastructure, Mateusz Berger, confirmed the news to the Polish Press Agency (PAP) and revealed that the accelerated schedule would allow up to twice as much gas as planned to be imported in the final quarter of 2022.\n\nA day earlier, Norway’s state-owned energy giant Equinor had announced that it has entered into a 10-year agreement to sell 2.4 billion cubic metres (bcm) of natural per year – around 14% of Polish annual consumption – to Poland’s state gas firm PGNiG via the Baltic Pipe.\n\nPGNiG, which has booked around 80% of the pipeline’s capacity, said that its own output from the Norwegian shelf – estimated at around 3 bcm this year and 4 bcm annually in coming years – will make up most of the gas transported through the pipe, reports Reuters.\n\nThe Baltic Pipe, construction of which began in 2020, is around 900 kilometres long in total and is being built at a cost of at least €1.6 billion, reports PAP. Around €250 million of that total has been provided by the European Union.\n\nNorway’s Equinor has entered into a 10-year agreement to sell natural gas to Poland that will cover around 15% of Polish annual consumption. The gas will be transported through the new Baltic Pipe, which is due to open next week https://t.co/ZXRdv7uBtP — Notes from Poland 🇵🇱 (@notesfrompoland) September 24, 2022\n\nIn June, it was announced that the longest onshore element of the pipeline, 191-kilometre stretch running across Poland, had been completed ahead of schedule. The following month, Poland’s gas system operator, Gaz-System, revealed that the pipeline had been connected to the Polish and Danish transmission systems.\n\nThe pipeline is part of Poland’s long-running efforts to diversify away from Russian energy supplies. That included the opening of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Świnoujście in 2015 and another planned floating LNG terminal in Gdańsk.\n\nAfter Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Polish government accelerated such efforts, announcing that it would end all Russian energy imports this year. Subsequently, in April, Russia’s Gazprom cut off its supply of gas to Poland after Warsaw refused its demand to pay in roubles.\n\nMain image credit: Gaz-System press materials",

    "Kindred will stay in Norway and appeal daily fines": "Kindred has announced that it will remain in the Norwegian market, and appeal regulator Lotteritilsynet's decision to impose daily fines on its operations.\n\nLotteritilsynet announced that it would pursue the fines – of NOK1.198m (£103,700/€116,000/$111,700) for every day its Trannel subsidiary continues to operate in Norway – earlier this month.\n\nThe fine would come into effect three weeks from the day the regulator decided to issue it – which would be 5 October.\n\nEarlier this year, Lotteritilsynet warned Kindred to withdraw form the Norwegian market or pay this fine, but Kindred said it would stay in the market as the operator did not believe it was in breach of any laws.\n\nOn 23 September, Henrik Tjärnström, CEO of Kindred, said that Kindred will appeal the fine.\n\n“We will appeal the decision of the Lotteritilsynet regarding the issuance of this sanction fee and will continue operating as usual, as long as the legal process is ongoing,” said Tjärnström. “We want to see how it pans out.”\n\nTjärnström said that Kindred disagrees with the idea that it is operating in Norway illegally. While only two busnesses are licensed by Norwegian authorities to offer online gambling, Tjärnström argued that Kindred was permitted to operate under European law as it holds a licence in Malta and is therefore covered by free movement of services in the European Economic Area.\n\n“We dispute the claim that we have operations in Norway,” he continued. “We are licensed in Malta and believe that Norwegian customers under current European economic legislation have the right to play on foreign sites if they wish.”\n\n“There is nothing that sets Norway apart from other European states in that respect.”\n\nTjärnström also reiterated his belief that Norway would soon begin steps to create a fully regulated model where private operators can apply for licences.\n\n“Again, time will tell as the process proceeds,” said Tjärnström. “But we are not doing anything wrong in Norway today.”\n\n“We accept traffic from Norwegian customers who find us in Malta and that is part of the legal framework that in our opinion prevails here. That’s our position.”\n\n“We are confident that we are doing nothing wrong and look forward to moving towards a locally regulated market in Norway as well.”\n\nIn July, Kindred lost an earlier lawsuit regarding the fine and its presence in Norway, though it then took this to a higher court to be appealed.",
    "Norway Wind Farm Might Close—Because It’s Too Windy": "Parts of wind turbines have fallen in strong winds in Northern Norway. The Norwegian government has threatened to close down the wind farm unless improvements are made.\n\nNorway is no stranger to renewable energy. Despite the economic boom of oil and gas, much of the country’s domestic energy use comes from hydropower. Recent years have seen more wind turbines pop up across the country.\n\nBut there have been problems. Local opposition has delayed or even stopped many projects. Now, technical problems at a large wind farm in the north of Norway threaten its closure.\n\nSince 2020, at least seven objects from the wind turbines at the Ånstadblåheia wind farm near Sortland have fallen to the ground in strong winds. The Norwegian Directorate of Water and Energy (NVE) is taking the situation seriously.\n\nIn fact, NVE has given formal notice that the facility will be closed if it cannot be repaired by 10 October. “We record repeated falling objects from the turbines linked to strong winds. This should not happen,” said NVE section manager Anne Johanne Kråkenes to NRK.\n\nA very windy location\n\nThe 14 turbines of Ånstadblåheia wind power plant are located on a hilltop in Sortland municipality, part of the Vesterålen islands.\n\nVesterålen is known for high winds and harsh weather.\n\nThe northern archipelago is known as a very windy place, so in theory wind turbines are the ideal solution for sustainsble energy.\n\n“The weather and wind in Vesterålen is probably one of the toughest things you can subject such machinery to,” said a power plant spokesperson to NRK.\n\nUnder normal operating conditions, Ånstadblåheia produces around 140-150 gigawatt hours of electricity a year. This corresponds to the annual energy consumption of around 7,500 Norwegian households.\n\nAn unusual situation\n\nAny wind power plant located on the coast of Northern Norway must be designed to withstand strong winds and harsh weather.\n\nNevertheless, strong winds and falling ice have caused the cover, panels and other parts to fall to the ground. This presents an onvious danger to local people and animals.\n\nNVE described the situation as “unusual” and something they have not seen at other similar wind power plants. “They have made some improvements. But we note that unwanted incidents still occur,” said Kråkenes.\n\nTechnicians are now busy installing new covers at the wind power plant. But its very much the last chance for the wind farm. Many locals wouldn’t be disappointed to see its closure.\n\nUnhappy locals\n\nEditor of the local newspaper, Morten Berg-Hansen, said many people were skeptical about the wind farm.\n\n“In the last two years it has not been safe to travel on the mountain. Although the facility is now being equipped for the future, and the surrounding area made safe, the reputation is damaged,” he said.",

    "Norway August Oil Production Rebounds": "grandriver\n\nA guest post by Ovi\n\nTypically, the POB posts have a theme. However, due to EIA schedule changes for issuing their reports and missing EIA reports, this post contains oil production updates for several Non-OPEC countries, plus the September DPR report. The country updates come from a combination of official country websites and news articles.\n\nThe Norway Petroleum Directorate (NPD) reported that production rebounded from June to July to 1,664 kb/d and then rose to 1,773 kb/d in August. (Red markers.). According to the NPD: “Oil production in August was 3.1 percent lower than the NPD’s forecast and 4.7 percent lower than the forecast so far this year.”\n\nThe rebound from the June low is due to the end of summer maintenance and possibly the start up of the second phase of the Johan Sverdrup field along with some other small fields.\n\nAccording to OPEC: “For 2022, production growth is expected to decrease by 43 tb/d y-o-y to average 2.0 mb/d. Norwegian liquid output dropped by 12% in 2Q22 to 1.74 mb/d, mainly because of maintenance at offshore platforms. In addition to some small start-ups, growth is expected in 4Q22, following the return from maintenance and second-phase production start-up of the Johan Sverdrup field.\n\nFor 2023, Norwegian liquids production is forecast to grow by 0.24 mb/d, unchanged from the previous month, to average 2.2 mb/d. Plenty of projects, from small to large, are scheduled to ramp up in 2023 in the Njord, Nova, Ringhorne, Alvheim, Oseberg and Snohvit fields. However, Johan Sverdrup is projected to be the main source of increased output for the year, making up roughly 35% of total Norway’s crude and condensate output.”\n\nChina reported that its output decreased in August to 3,989 kb/d, a drop of close to 200 kb/d from June. (Red markers)\n\nChina may be close to its current maximum production level of close to 4,000 kb/d. To offset declines, the national oil company is investing in conventional wells and also drilling for Shale Oil. See Below.\n\nAccording to OPEC: “Natural decline rates are expected to be offset by the Chinese national oil company’s considerable investments. Tianjin, Xinjiang, Heilongjiang, and Shaanxi were the main producing provinces in the first half of the year. Chinese companies expect additional growth through more in-fill wells and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects.\n\nFor 2023, y-o-y growth of 30 tb/d is forecast for an average of 4.5 m/d, with Bozhong 29-6, Wushi 17-2 and Kenli 10-1N planned to come on stream under the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC). At the same time, ramp-ups are expected from the Changqing, Jilin and Liaohe projects, which are managed by Petro China. The new projects will slightly offset declines from the mature onshore production base.”\n\nAccording to this source, China’s CNOOC has found shale oil in its South China Sea exploration well for the first time.\n\n“CNOOC believes that the Beibu gulf contains 8.76 billion barrels of shale oil, and claimed that the wildcat well flowed 20 cubic metres/day (m³/d) (125.8 b/d) of shale oil and 1,589m³/d (56,092 ft^3/d) of natural gas, which the Chinese oil giant is calling a commercial discovery.”\n\nAccording to this source, August production fell after rebounding in July. The article just reports Crude oil production. Consequently the August number shown in is an estimate based on the percentage drop and a typical C + C to C ratio using earlier EIA data.\n\n“The fall in output was due to a sharp decline in production in the giant Kashagan oil field after a gas leak early in August, as well as planned output curbs in the Tengiz field due to regular maintenance.”\n\nMexico’s oil production increased by 10 kb/d in August to 1,797 kb/d. This is the third increase since May. Note that the red markers will be reduced by the EIA by close to 80 kb/d. Pemex reported production for May was 1,775 kb/d. The EIA reduced it to 1,695 kb/d, a reduction of 80 kb/d, due to a different definition for C + C.\n\nAccording to this source, August production fell by 30 kb/d from July’s output of 10,460 kb/d to 10,430 kb/d. In addition, this source revised down the original June output from 10,760 kb/d to 10,667 kb/d, a downward revision of 93 kb/d.\n\nAccording to this source, UK production dropped in May to 701 kb/d and then rebounded in July to 734 kb/d. Clearly UK production is in decline.\n\nGuyana added an additional 30 kb/d of production in August to reach new high of 390 kb/d. According to the chart below, the operating companies appear to be ahead of schedule on production.\n\nGuyana production schedule.\n\nThis chart shows Saudi Arabia’a oil stocks starting in 2019. In October 2015, SA had 326 million barrels in storage. Between then and January 2019, their stocks were reduced by 126 M barrels. During most of 2021, stocks bounced around 132 M barrels. In 2022, they have slowly risen to 142 M barrels in July\n\nOn September 23, 2022, WTI settled below the psychological level of $80/b. OPEC has stated that $80/b Brent is a fair price for both producers and consumers. More recently, some OPEC spoke persons have indicated their preferred level has drifted up to $90/b.\n\nRigs and Fracs\n\nThe rig story continues to be that the US Rig count has been holding steady at close to 545 rigs for the past seven weeks. In the week ending September 26, the rig count was unchanged from the previous week at 545. That was down six rigs from July 29 when 551 were operating.\n\nThe Permian rose by 1 rig to 322 and is down 9 rigs from a high of 331 on July 1. Note that 59% of the Hz rigs are located in the Permian.\n\nTexas dropped by 2 to 304 and is essentially unchanged relative to May 20 when 303 were operating.\n\nAfter New Mexico dropped 7 rigs in the first week of August to 96, the rig count has slowly increased to back above 100 to 101. The general trend in the New Mexico Permian has been to add an average of 0.57 rigs per week. This contrasts with the overall Permian trend shown above which has been in a slight down trend.\n\nFrac spreads have not shown any growth over the last six months. A high of 290 was reached on February 25 and was not surpassed till July 29, 295. For the week ending September 23, 1 frac spread was added for a total of 288.\n\nDrilling Productivity Report\n\nThe Drilling Productivity Report (DPR) uses recent data on the total number of drilling rigs in operation along with estimates of drilling productivity and estimated changes in production from existing oil wells to provide estimated changes in oil production for the principal tight oil regions. The September DPR forecasts production to October 2022 and the following charts are updated to October 2022.\n\nAbove is the total oil production projected to October 2022 for the 7 DPR basins that the EIA tracks. Note that DPR production includes both LTO oil and oil from conventional wells.\n\nThe September DPR report has downwardly revised the April to September production forecast. The original forecast for August 2022 was 9,069 kb/d. The revised estimate for August is 8,845 kb/d, a downward revision of 224 kb/d. Of the 224 kb/d, 59 kb/d can be attributed to the DPR revising the Bakken April output down by 59 kb/d due to the April/May storm.\n\nThe DPR is projecting that oil output for October 2022 will increase by 132 kb/d to 9,116 kb/d. From April’s output of 8,352 kb/d to October’s 2022, output in the DPR basins is forecast to increase by 764 kb/d or by an average of 127 kb/d/mth.\n\nPermian output continues to increase. In October, production is expected to increase by 66 kb/d to a new high of 5,413 kb/d. From May to September, production is forecast to increase by 346 kb/d or at an average rate of 69.2 kb/d/mth. If the Permian were part of OPEC, at 5,413 kb/d it would be the second largest producer after Saudi Arabia.\n\nDuring August, 416 wells were drilled and 435 were completed in the Permian. (Note that August is the latest data for DUC info). The completed wells added 378 kb/d to August’s output for an average of 870 b/d/well. The overall decline was 292 kb/d which resulted in a net increase for Permian output of 86 kb/d. Of the 435 completed wells, 336 were required to offset the decline. The completion of 19 extra DUCs over the drilled wells contributed 16.5 kb/d of the overall 86 kb/d increase.\n\nOutput in the Eagle Ford basin has been showing an increasing trend since March 2022. For October, output is expected to increase by 26 kb/d to 1,250 kb/d. At the beginning of the year, 43 rigs were operating in the EF. As of September, 66 are operational and accounts for the increasing production.\n\nThe DPR forecasts Bakken output in October to be 1,204 kb/d an increase of 21 kb/d from September.\n\nThis chart shows the Bakken’s output as reported by the North Dakota government. July production was reported to be 1,027 kb/d down 28 kb/d from June. The DPR Bakken chart above shows July production to be 1,143 kb/d, 16 kb/d higher.\n\nOutput in the Niobrara continues to increase slowly. October output increased by 9 kb/d to 657 kb/d.\n\nDUCs and Drilled Wells\n\nThe number of DUCs available for completion in the Permian and the four major DPR oil basins has continued to fall every month since July 2020. Prior to July 2020 more wells were drilled than were completed. The last two data points show how the use of DUCs continues to slow and is further illustrated in the next chart.\n\nWhile this chart is titled “Excess of Completed Wells over Drilled”, it could also have been called “Monthly change in DUC completion rate” because the excess of completed wells in a given month is equal to the change in the DUC completion rate.\n\nIn these four primarily oil basins, the change in monthly completion rate of DUCs started slowing after peaking in March 2021. In August 2022, 9 fewer DUCs (2,571 to 2,562) remained than in July. Similarly the monthly completion rate for DUCs in the Permian continues to fall. In August, the number of remaining DUCs fell by 19 (1,180 to 1,161). Note that since Permian excess wells were greater than in all four basins combined, a few basins drilled more wells than were completed. For instance in the Niobrara, 119 wells were drilled and 110 were completed.\n\nIn the Permian, the monthly completion rate has been showing signs of slowing since the recent March peak of 444. This is consistent with the frac spread chart shown above where there has been no growth in frac spreads since February.\n\nIn August 435 wells were completed, 4 fewer than in July and 9 fewer than in March. During August, 416 new wells were drilled, a decrease of 2 over July. This is the first time that there was a MoM drop in drilled wells. The gap between drilled and completed wells in the Permian has reached a new current low of 19 DUCs, which is the same as reported in the previous chart.\n\nOriginal Post\n\nEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.",

    "NEP Norway Expands SMPTE ST 2110 Operation": "NEP Norway Expands SMPTE ST 2110 Operation\n\nStory Highlights\n\nMediaproxy has continued its working relationship with outside broadcast and playout facilities group NEP by supplying its LogServer software for SMPTE ST 2110 recording at its Norwegian operation.\n\nNEP Norway first began using Mediaproxy software in 2017, when it chose LogServer for its next generation compliance recording on the SDI channels distributed from its playout center. This replaced a custom-built system and when the company needed a logging system for new ST 2110 services, the decision was taken to expand the installation, which was facilitated thanks to easy software-based integration for uncompressed IP video sources.\n\nThe new channel platform was installed in the second quarter of this year and as well as compliance monitoring it is also used to check problems on already-broadcast programs, while the As-run feature provides a record for advertisers of what has been sent to air.\n\nMediaproxy LogServer is a software-based IP logging and analysis system that supports SMPTE ST 2110, NMOS and SCTE ad-insertion. Delivering reliable compliance monitoring and recording of program output to meet broadcast standards and regulations, it can integrate seamlessly with cloud, virtual or on-premises workflows. The platform also supports video, audio and real-time data from sources including 4K, HDR, 10-bit, HEVC, TSoIP, SMPTE 2110, Zixi and SRT.\n\nNEP Norway technical manager Rune Olsen sees the key benefits of LogServer as being its ease of use and stability, plus excellent support from Mediaproxy. “The software has worked without a hitch from the get-go and Mediaproxy is very fast in responding to any questions we may have,” he says. “The interface is also very easy and efficient to use.

    "Drones, AiRMOUR in Norway started report validation procedures": "Development of life-saving drone services proceeds with validations – AiRMOUR’s first round of flight demonstrations began last week in Norway\n\nAiRMOUR intends to validate the research carried out in the project through real drone flights in Stavanger (Norway), Helsinki (Finland) and Kassel (Germany)\n\nThe validations include several use cases of life-saving services.\n\nAiRMOUR is a research and innovation project focused on the development of urban air mobility.\n\nThe objective of the three-year project is to meet the needs of emergency medical services and to provide guidance to municipalities on opportunities for drone services.\n\nTECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION AT THE SERVICE OF FIRE BRIGADES AND CIVIL PROTECTION OPERATORS: DISCOVER THE IMPORTANCE OF DRONES AT THE FOTOKITE BOOTH\n\nA total of 13 partners from six countries (Finland, Sweden, Norway, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands) are participating in the project, which is funded by the EU’s Horizon 2020 programme.\n\nIn the first half of the project, the AiRMOUR team researched potential use cases in the medical field, tried to identify the place of these new drone services in the existing medical system and analysed potential aerial risks, among other things.\n\nNow the project will proceed to validate the research with real drone flights organised from this autumn to spring 2023.\n\nThe first flights took place on 21 September in Stavanger, Norway, before continuing to the cities of Helsinki, Finland, and Kassel, Germany.\n\nAiRMOUR’s validation flights involve the use of two different types of drones (Ehang 216 and Falcon L400) and the transport of medical equipment and emergency medical services personnel\n\nPersonnel deliveries are most likely to take place using test dummies.\n\nThese types of new and innovative services are intended to be a useful addition to the existing medical system.\n\nThe objective of the validations is to move from less demanding flights and circumstances to more demanding ones, in order to increase the overall understanding of what is possible within the European regulatory framework for urban air mobility, with current operational capabilities and user requirements.\n\nThe expectation is to gain a great deal of new cutting-edge knowledge in terms of social aspects (e.g. public acceptance, commercial viability) and also technological aspects, such as airborne risks, ground risks, patient risks, airspace limitations and landing infrastructure – and much more, as determined within the framework of our work on AiRMOUR success criteria, which precedes all validations,’ says AiRMOUR project coordinator Dr Petri Mononen of VTT, Technical Research Centre of Finland.\n\nMultiple use case demonstrations\n\nDuring AiRMOUR’s first validation flights in Stavanger, operator Ehang Scandinavia will fly a defibrillator over a lake to a person suffering a heart attack.\n\nIn November, weather permitting, deliveries of other emergency medical products such as an EpiPen, adrenaline or specialised medical equipment will be tested in Helsinki.\n\nThe final phase will take place in Kassel, Germany, in spring 2023 and will focus on transport between medical facilities, i.e. ‘A-B flights’. In Luxembourg, validations will be carried out in the form of simulations.\n\nOur first validations primarily serve to collect a lot of data for further analysis, but more importantly they serve as benchmarks for subsequent ones, to make sure we are on the right track in terms of operational capabilities in compliance with regulations,’ says Mononen.\n\nAccording to Mononen, all lessons learnt from the first AiRMOUR validations will influence and improve subsequent ones\n\nAfter collecting all the data from the validation operations, the project will move on to the final analysis and reporting phase to produce the main scientific contributions.\n\nThe contributions will include significant insights, advice and suggestions for the rest of Europe to support the safe and effective emergence of urban air mobility,’ he said.\n\nThe drones used in the AiRMOUR test\n\nEhang Falcon L400\n\nLogistics drone with a maximum weight of 24.5 kg and a maximum payload of 5 kg to carry.\n\nDiameter approximately 1.2 metres\n\nAUTOMATIC flights with safety pilots who can take remote control if necessary\n\nIntav Expo 720×90 Aside Logo\n\nTypical operations up to a distance of 25 km\n\nMaximum flight speed 90 km/h\n\nOperations in AiRMOUR project will be performed as VLOS and BLOS in Specific Class, SAIL II with improved containment\n\nEhang 216\n\nVTOL for passengers\n\nApproximately 5.6 metres in diameter\n\nNo pilot on board\n\nMaximum payload weight 600 kg\n\n2 passengers or 220 kg payload\n\nAUTOMATED flights with safety pilots who can take remote control if necessary\n\nTypical operations up to 30 km distance\n\nMaximum flight speed 120 km/h\n\nOperations within the AiRMOUR project will be performed in accordance with EASA regulations and require the aircraft to achieve Design Verification.\n\nRead Also:\n\nEmergency Live Even More…Live: Download The New Free App Of Your Newspaper For IOS And Android\n\nAiRMOUR Helps European Cities With Healthcare Drones (EMS Drones)\n\nBotswana, Drones To Deliver Essential And Emergency Medical Supplies\n\nItaly / SEUAM, The Drone For Transporting Drugs And Defibrillators, Starts Testing In October\n\nMozambique, UN Project To Use Drones For Post-Disaster Search And Rescue\n\nFotokite At The Service Of Firefighters And Security: The Drone System Is In Emergency Expo\n\nIvory Coast, Medical Supplies To Over 1,000 Health Facilities Thanks To Zipline Drones\n\nNigeria: Delivery Of Drugs And Medical Supplies To Be Carried Out Using Zipline Drones\n\nDrones That Save Lives: Uganda Breaks Down Geographical Barriers Thanks To New Technology\n\nFotokite Flies At Interschutz: Here Is What You Will Find In Hall 26, Stand E42\n\nDrones And Firefighters: Fotokite Partners With ITURRI Group To Bring Easy Aerial Situational Awareness To Firefighters In Spain And Portugal\n\nUK / Queen Elizabeth’s Funeral, Security Comes From The Sky: Helicopters And Drones Keep Watch From Above\n\nRobotic Technologies In Forest Firefighting: Study On Drone Swarms For Fire Brigade Efficiency And Safety\n\nFotokite Tethered Drones: A Synonym Of Safety For Big Events\n\nSource:\n\nAiRMOUR",
    "Norway renews commitment to World Heritage Leadership": "Initiated in 2016, the World Heritage Leadership Programme aims to improve heritage practices in the culture and nature sectors. It provides guidance and tools to conserve World Heritage effectively and fosters networks for peer learning.\n\nWorld Heritage Leadership empowers heritage practitioners across the globe with the tools and capacity to deliver excellence in the management of the planet’s most iconic places,” said Grethel Aguilar, IUCN Deputy Director General. “IUCN is proud to collaborate with ICCROM, and our many partners, on such a valuable initiative for the World Heritage community. We thank sincerely Norway for their continued engagement and support for this vital work.”\n\nIn its first phase running up to 2022, the programme successfully completed new and updated resources seen as essential for the effective management of World Heritage sites. These include the recently launched Guidance and Toolkit for Impact Assessment in a World Heritage context. The programme also held numerous courses in different regions and on various topics, such as nature-culture linkages, disaster risk reduction, and community engagement.\n\nIn its second phase, the World Heritage Leadership Programme will focus on strengthening regional networks, working with various actors and institutions from the local to global levels. One of its main aims will be to multiply capacity-building opportunities for heritage practitioners and improve access by delivering them in diverse languages and contexts.\n\nManaging World Heritage in the 21st century is a complex task and we need to build our own capacities to do our jobs better,” said ICCROM Director-General Webber Ndoro. “The best way to do that is to learn from each other and support each other, tapping into a global family working together to protect and conserve World Heritage. We extend our deep gratitude to Norway for recognizing the pressing need to continue developing present and future generations’ capacity to care for our precious World Heritage.”\n\nWorld Heritage sites are internationally recognised as places so valuable to humanity that they must be protected from one generation to the next. They include iconic sites such as the Great Barrier Reef, Machu Picchu, or the West Norwegian Fjords. Despite their high profile, they face increasing pressure from various threats such as natural disasters, conflict and unsustainable development. Climate change is the top threat to the 252 natural World Heritage sites listed up to 2020, according to the IUCN World Heritage Outlook.\n\nNorway’s continued support for World Heritage Leadership recognises that practitioners involved in the conservation of these exceptional sites have a crucial role to play in ensuring their effective management. Its commitment to the second phase of the programme extends to strengthening the capacity of heritage professionals of the next generation.\n\n“World Heritage properties are global common goods. Norway attaches particular importance to the capacity-building work to ensure that all countries are enabled to preserving and benefitting from their own cultural and natural heritage,” said Aleksander Øren Heen, State Secretary at the Norwegian Ministry of Climate and Environment. “Good, long-term management of a nation’s cultural and natural heritage is essential for sustainable development.”\n\nThe new phase of commitment was announced at the World Heritage Leadership Forum on 21 September 2022. High-level delegates at the event reflected on how capacity building has contributed to the first 50 years of implementation of the World Heritage Convention, and how to strengthen it in the future.",

Use the free Adobe Acrobat Reader to view this PDF file\n\nSummary:\n\nThe economy bounced back strongly from the first wave of Covid-19 pandemic, and the recovery is well entrenched in 2022. However, risks to the outlook are considerable, given the uncertainty over spillovers from the war in Ukraine, the intensity of the pandemic globally, and in Europe, in particular, and supply bottlenecks. Given the strong fundamentals, Norway is relatively shielded and there are both upside (higher energy prices and export volumes) and downside risks (lower demand from Europe for non-energy exports). The forecast is especially sensitive to where energy prices settle, whether energy supply to Europe will be disrupted, and Norway’s capacity to increase gas supplies to Europe.",
    "Norway’s ’Salmon Eye’ Opens in Hardangerfjord": "Accessible only by ferry, the floating exhibition space is designed to inform visitors about aquaculture and the future of the seafood industry.\n\nEide Fjordbruk is an established salmon producer in Norway’s Hardangerfjord region. The third-generation owners Sondre and Erlend Eide wanted to remember their father while creating something of value.\n\nSalmon Eye launch event in the Hardangerfjord, Photo: Kvorning Design.\n\nThe result? Salmon Eye, a new floating installation and forum space that’s designed to educate visitors on sustainable seafood, fish farming and the production of Norwegian salmon.\n\nSeafood is a huge success story for Norwegian industry, second only to oil and gas. The export value of salmon is twice the amount of all other fish combined. However, there are critics of some of the industry practices.\n\nThe idea for the project began in 2019. Kvorning Design‘s experimental plans were revealed in 2021 and the building completed in August 2022, in time for the unveiling event in the Hardangerfjord earlier this week.\n\nExperimental design becomes a reality\n\nBold architectural designs are nothing new these days, especially in Scandinavia. But very few of them actually become a reality.\n\nSalmon Eye exhibition centre in the Hardangerfjord. Photo: Kvorning Design.\n\nDanish firm Kvorning Design stated their gratitude to the Eide family for their trust and cooperation with the design and communications firm around the realization of the experiential design for Salmon Eye.\n\nThe basis for the design was a fish eye with a hole on top of the architecture. Based on this, the curved, floating architecture and art installation is covered in 9,500 stainless steel plates designed to imitate the appearance and colour of fish scales.\n\nSalmon Eye weighs 1,256 tonnes and is 25 meters in diameter. Also designed by Kvorning Design, the interior features 650 square metres of space. It’s divided into four floors, one of which is underwater.\n\nSalmon Eye as an educational space\n\nThe forum element of Salmon Eye is an immersive audio-visual space designed to inform visitors about the aquaculture of sea farming and what harms and protects the sea and its species.\n\nSalmon is an important export industry for Norway.\n\nAccording to Eide, it is designed to help visitors recognise the ocean as an important food source, educate them on seafood practices of today and what future standards in aquaculture might look like.\n\nPlanned events include talks that aim to inspire, share ideas, and discuss the importance of sustainable aquaculture with its guests.\n\nEide’s environmental push\n\nThe Salmon Eye is undoubtedly a passion project for the brothers Sondre and Erlend Eide, the third generation in the family’s business. With some critical of the environmental impact of salmon farming in Norway, Eide is hoping to change people’s minds.\n\nEide Fjordbruk was the first fish farming company to produce carbon-neutral salmon, and the first to present environmental accounts. The company has introduced all-electric boats and facilities.\n\nThe firm will shortly unveil a new technology known as “Watermoon”, which it states enables farming in the fjord and sea with no negative impact on the environment or climate.\n\nWhat do you think of the Salmon Eye?",
    "Coastal mayors from Norway’s Centre Party warn on salmon tax rumours": "Fish farming companies in Norway are bracing themselves for a possible new “salmon tax” next month.\n\nThe Oslo Labour coalition government will present the country’s national budget on 6 October and there are widespread reports that taxes on aquaculture industry profits will be hiked.\n\nThe reports led at the weekend to several Centre Party mayors urging the government not to proceed with such a plan.\n\nThere is no doubt that salmon farm profits have increased substantially this year on the back of soaring prices, but so too have costs, notably for energy, feed and labour.\n\nFish farming and conventional fishing provide an economic lifeline for many of Norway’s coastal communities.\n\nMayor Sigrun Wiggen Prestbakmo, who represents the Salangen municipality in the Troms and Finnmark region, told the national broadcaster NRK that the government should put an end to the tax rise rumours, saying it would be robbery on such communities.\n\nShe said: “I have told the municipal minister that if this is implemented, he must prioritise crisis packages along the coast, but the Ministry of Finance will not discuss what is in the budget until it is presented next month.”\n\nPrestbakmo said: “the state must find another way to plug the hole in the state budget”, arguing that “if the government responds by slapping on more taxes then many jobs along the coast will be depleted within a few years”.\n\nGovernment spokeswoman Therese Riiser replied: “Tax and duty changes will be presented in the state budget on 6 October. We will not comment on what it will contain until then.”",

    "Norway’s Family Immigration Permit Explained": "There’s a lot of confusion out there about the family immigration permit offered by Norway. Here’s what you need to know.\n\nAs anyone who has done it will surely agree, moving to any country is a complicated process. There’s a lot of different categories of residence permits with many terms and conditions, ifs and buts.\n\nOne of those conditions is related to whether you can bring your family with you or not. A work permit is an individual permit and doesn’t automatically mean your partner or other close family member can accompany you.\n\nIf you’re planning on moving to Norway to work, your partner or children can usually join you but they will need to apply for a different permit.\n\nIntroducing family immigration\n\nNorway’s immigration rules offer a specific residence permit available for family members of someone who already holds a residence permit. This is known as family immigration.\n\nThere’s a lot of misinformation out there about what family immigration means. For example, we are often contacted by people who have Norwegian ancestry and assume the family immigration permit applies to them. This is not the case.\n\nThis article rounds up the basic principles of family immigration in Norway. The rules are different depending on the country of citizenship of the people involved, the family relationship, and the type of residence permit held by the person already living in Norway.\n\nAs always, the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration (UDI) has all the official information. You should verify what applies to your own circumstances on their website, as there are too many exceptions and conditions to cover every single on in this post.\n\nWho can apply for family immigration?\n\nThere are several categories of relation who can apply for a family immigration permit.\n\nPartners\n\nFirstly, if your spouse, long-term partner or cohabitant holds a residence permit in Norway, you are eligible to apply. You can usually do this at the same time as your partner applies for a skilled worker visa, and you should get your answer at the same time.\n\nMarriages of convenience and forced marriages are not permitted. Both partners must also have plans to live together in Norway. In the case of cohabitants, they must have lived together for at least two years and both be over the age of 24.\n\nIf the partner with residence in Norway is not an EU/EEA citizen, they must usually prove an income of NOK 300,988 per year and cannot have received financial aid from Nav in the prior 12 months.\n\nThere are reductions and/or exemptions to the income requirement for those who have been granted asylum in Norway. This is especially true within the first year as a refugee.\n\nChildren\n\nFor EU/EEA citizens, children under the age of 21 can join a parent or parents living in Norway by using the registration program for EU/EEA nationals.\n\nFor non-EU/EEA citizens, children under 18 can join a parent or parents living in Norway. The parent must have an income of at least NOK 300,988 and hold a valid work permit or study permit. If only one parent is living in Norway, the other parent must give their consent.\n\nAs with the rules for partners, there are exceptions to the income requirements for successful asylum seekers who wish to bring their children to Norway, but this must be done within the first year.\n\nParents\n\nFor EU/EEA citizens, a parent, grandparent, or great-grandparent who is already being supported by the family member in Norway is eligible to apply for family immigration. This doesn’t apply for those holding study permits.\n\nAs per the terms of the EU/EEA registration program, the parent will need to get a job, start a program of study, or prove they have sufficient funds.\n\nNon-EU/EEA parents of adult children living in Norway are usually not permitted to apply for family immigration. However, exceptions are made for a single parent that has no parents, children, or great-grandchildren in their home country. In this case, the income requirement applies to the child living in Norway.\n\nIt’s also possible for a parent to apply for family immigration in order to visit an adult child for up to nine months. This permit cannot be renewed, but it can be applied for again after one year of the permit expiring.\n\nOther family members\n\nThe rules for other family members coming to Norway vary considerably. As a general rule, other family members cannot join non-EU/EEA citizens living in Norway.\n\nUDI states that exceptions to this are assessed but they would only be granted when “strong humanitarian considerations” apply.\n\nFor EU/EEA citizens, it’s possible for siblings without care providers to apply for family immigration. This also applies for family members with serious health problems and nursing needs, if the person living in Norway is the only person that can provide care.\n\nMoving to join a Norwegian citizen\n\nIf the family member already living in Norway is a Norwegian citizen, some of the rules are a little different.\n\nNon-EU/EEA spouses and cohabitants can apply for family immigration as long as they have previously lived together, are expecting a child together, or are planning to get married in Norway within the next six months. The income requirement applies to the Norwegian citizen.\n\nSimilar rules apply for parents and children of Norwegian citizens. In addition, a person who had a Norwegian parent when they were born can apply for family immigration, but they must prove an income of NOK 278,693. The Norwegian parent must have held Norwegian citizenship at the time.\n\nWhat can you do with a family immigration permit?\n\nIn general, family immigration permits allow you to work in Norway. They also allow you to apply for permanent residence after five years, should you meet the other requirements.\n\nEventually, you would be able to apply for Norwegian citizenship, should you meet all the other criteria such as language ability.\n\nSome people given family immigration permits can access free Norwegian language lessons, but do have an obligation to complete them. Free lessons are not available to those who do not have an obligation to complete them, including EU/EEA citizens.\n\nHow to apply for family immigration\n\nThe application process begins online at the UDI website. Depending on your circumstances you may be able to hand in the required documents at a police station in Norway, or at your nearest Norwegian Embassy or Consulate.\n\nApplicants must pay a substantial application fee. At present, this is NOK 10,500 for a first-time applicant. Renewals are a lot cheaper, and there are lower fees for some categories.\n\nThe documents you need for your application will be made clear to you during the application process on the UDI website.\n\nHow long does family immigration take?\n\nThere is no single waiting time for family immigration applications. It depends on many factors including the type of residence permit the person in Norway has, your family relationship, and where you hand in your application.\n\nIn very general terms, 3-4 months is common, but it can take up to 10 months in some cases.\n\nIf you submit an application for family immigration at the same time as your family member submits one for a work permit (for example), you should recieve the responses together.\n\nIn some cases, UDI may conduct additional investigations to verify identity and other circumstances. This could include an interview with the Norwegian police and even a DNA test to verify a family link. The waiting time for these cases varies considerably.\n\nIt is possible to appeal against a rejection, but this process is also a lengthy one. UDI states a waiting time of up to 12 months for appeals.\n\nProblems with family immigration permits\n\nEarlier this year, UDI identified several cases of fraud in family immigration applications. These included false income and employment claims.\n\nBoth UDI and the Immigration Appeals Board (UNE) sometimes see issues with the size of the salary and whether the job even exists. This most commonly occurs with construction jobs and the hospitality and service industry.",
    "Hurtigruten Norway launches its first hybrid ship": "Hurtigruten Norway has launched its first environmentally-upgraded battery-hybrid powered ship, MS Richard With. It is the first of seven in the Coastal Express fleet to be upgraded, and now features technology that will significantly reduce both CO2 and Nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions.\n\nAs part of a major effort to make Hurtigruten Norway’s fleet more sustainable, the company has invested nearly 100 million Euros towards green upgrades that will be implemented by early 2024.\n\nThis move follows its sister company, Hurtigruten Expeditions, introducing the world’s first battery-hybrid powered expedition ship, MS Roald Amundsen, in 2019. The expedition cruise brand now has three battery-hybrid powered ships in its fleet.\n\nBecoming a green company means investing in efforts with documented effects, such as the ones we are doing now. As a result, by next summer, we will have three upgraded hybrid ships sailing the coast, and our entire fleet will be more energy efficient, cutting CO2-emissions by 25% and NOx by 80%\n\nsaid Hedda Felin, CEO of Hurtigruten Norway.\n\nMS Richard With has gone through extensive upgrades and been retrofitted with battery packages, brand new engines, and new propulsion systems at Myklebust Yard in northwestern Norway. All Hurtigruten Norway’s seven ships will also be fitted with SCR systems that cut NOx emissions by a massive 80% by early 2024.\n\nThis is one of the largest environmental upgrades of its kind in Europe, and the largest in Hurtigruten’s history. The fact that we have made these upgrades at Myklebust Yard, with as much Norwegian technology as possible, is no coincidence\n\nMs. Felin stated, adding that “our goal is to get to zero emissions, and the work to plan the next generation zero emission vessels has already started. Until that technology has been pioneered, we are investing heavily in giving our existing fleet a green upgrade with the best technology available today, but our plan is to have the first emission-free ship in our fleet by 2030, and we’re working hard on achieving that.”",
    "To keep arming Ukraine, Norway may drop munitions stocks below required levels": "WASHINGTON — Norway is considering letting stocks of key munitions drop below their required levels, accepting greater vulnerability in the short term as the price the northern European nation is willing to pay to keep up the flow of weaponry to Ukraine.\n\nThe move would coincide with a longer-term push to raise the required baseline for munitions stockpiles to new, higher levels down the road. In other words, Norway is prepared to take on short term risk to keep Russia tied up in Ukraine, while looking to expand stockpiles in the future when munition production is more readily available.\n\nThe idea was still conceptual, and would need approval of Norway’s parliament. But Norwegian defense minister Bjørn Arild Gram, speaking to a small group of reporters while in Washington this week, said that getting the balance right between present and future planning is going to be a major focus over the coming months.\n\n“We are more looking how we can increase the stocks from previous levels. But we are looking into if you can take even more from our stocks in the short term to support Ukraine. And to then to refill it,” he said. “Obviously we want to increase that even more, but maybe in the short term, we are donating.”\n\nAn aide to the minister noted that “we are at the point where we are looking to go lower because of the situation [in Ukraine] of course, but … longer term that is certainly pointing to an increase. So maybe [taking on] more risk now” with an eye towards the future.\n\n“More and more it will be about cooperating with industry and purchasing new equipment,” Gram added.\n\nRELATED: Norwegian air chief: Russia isn’t ’10 feet tall,’ but don’t discount it\n\nThere is growing concern on both sides of the Atlantic about munition stocks and how quickly industry can replace the weapons being donated to Ukraine. In July, the defense minister from The Netherlands described the situation as everyone “standing in line at the ammunition factories” and called for more coordination among industry. The Pentagon plans to host a meeting of European armaments leaders to figure out how best to coordinate such efforts, even as US firms struggle to keep up with demand for some of the highest-profile weapons being used by Kyiv.\n\nFor Norway, the majority of what has been sent to Ukraine was equipment that was being phased out of active use by the Norwegian military, Gram said. According to a Norwegian fact sheet, the following gear has been either shipped or is in the process of being shipped to Ukraine:\n\n4,000 M72 anti-tank weapons\n\n1,500 bulletproof vests, 5,000 helmets, 15,000 field rations, 1,000 protective masks with filters, 2,000 sleeping bags, 10,000 sleeping mats, some night vision equipment and some clothing\n\nApproximately 100 Mistral air defense missiles and a number of launchers\n\n22 M109 howitzers, including related gear, spare parts and ammunition\n\nMLRS long-range rocket artillery system, provided by a partnership between Norway and the United Kingdom\n\n14 Iveco LAV III Armored Vehicles\n\nApproximately 160 Hellfire missiles with supporting equipment\n\nIn addition to the MLRS, the Kingdom has teamed with the UK on three initiatives: training Ukrainian forces in the United Kingdom, jointly funding the acquisition of the Norwegian micro-drone Black Hornet system (Norway is contributing NOK 90 million, or $8.5 million USD, to that effort), and contributing NOK 400 million ($38.4 million) to a UK-led fund for procurement and transportation of weapons to Ukraine.\n\nAsked what might come next, Gram declined to go into detail.\n\n“Beyond that, I won’t speculate too much in what can be future donations,” he said. “It will be a mix of what we take from our own stocks, what we buy from the industry, what we finance to other countries supplying Ukraine.

    "Wang Yi Meets with Foreign Minister Anniken Huitfeldt of Norway": "On September 21, 2022 local time, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with Norwegian Foreign Minister Anniken Huitfeldt on the sidelines of the United Nations (UN) General Assembly in New York.\n\nWang Yi said, pragmatic cooperation between China and Norway has made positive progress in recent years. Last year, bilateral trade increased by nearly 40 percent year on year. Free trade agreement (FTA) negotiations have entered the final stage, and a new version on avoidance of double taxation will soon be signed. In the face of world changes and chaos, stability and confidence are more important than gold. The two sides should respect each other and treat each other as equals, increase understanding and eliminate misunderstanding, maintain the sound momentum of sound and stable development of China-Norway relations, strengthen exchanges at all levels, and promote pragmatic cooperation to achieve more results. China is ready to work with Norway to strengthen communication and coordination in the United Nations and other multilateral institutions and jointly practice true multilateralism.\n\nHuitfeldt said that the Norwegian side is pleased that the two sides have overcome the pandemic and continued to advance bilateral relations. Norway and China have great potential for cooperation in such areas as climate change response, economic transformation, renewable energy, and green development. Norway looks forward to speeding up FTA negotiations and continuing to conduct constructive cooperation with China.\n\nWang Yi expressed, China has played an important role in promoting the conclusion of the Paris Agreement. China will continue to show its responsibility as a major country and shoulder its due responsibility for the future of humanity. We stay committed to the path of green, low-carbon, and sustainable development, and have set two ambitious goals of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality to achieve the largest reduction in carbon emission intensity in the world. We vigorously develop renewable energy, with electricity generated by wind and solar power ranking the first worldwide, as well as the world's largest production and sales of new energy vehicles. Developed countries are expected to honor their commitments and provide financial, technological, and capacity-building support to developing countries.\n\nHuitfeldt said that Europe is deeply worried about the current situation in Ukraine and hopes that China will play an important role. Wang Yi expounded on the principled position of the Chinese government and stressed that what President Xi Jinping has proposed that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries must be respected, the purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be fully observed, the legitimate security concerns of all countries must be taken seriously, and all efforts that are conducive to the peaceful settlement of the crisis must be supported is the fundamental guide for China in dealing with the Ukraine issue. The international community should support all efforts conducive to peace, and cope with the challenges brought by the spillover of the crisis to world economic recovery. China will continue to play a constructive role in promoting peace talks in its own way.",

    "Norway open to gas price caps": "Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, left, with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres at the U.N. Gernal Assembly in New York | Craig Ruttle/Pool/EPA-EFE\n\nNEW YORK — Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre says his country is open to the previously unthinkable step of imposing price caps on gas to rein in Europe’s energy crisis.\n\nAs political leaders, activists and philanthropists piled on the pressure Wednesday to act to limit climate change at U.N. General Assembly events, Støre told POLITICO that “no solution should be off the table,\" when asked about a push by some European governments for gas price caps.\n\n\"No proposal, no idea\" is off limits, he said. \"We really have to work on this together.\"\n\nStøre sees Europe’s energy crisis as the key plank of what he called “Putin’s war on Europe. They have a military campaign in Ukraine, and they have an energy war in Europe.\"\n\nWhile many European governments support a price cap — including Italy, Poland Belgium, Greece and Sweden — some governments, like Germany, have concerns. With gas in short supply and high demand, some exporters may be tempted to send their gas to other parts of the world if the EU imposes a price cap.\n\nStøre himself is skeptical that a price cap would achieve its aims, “because the danger of doing that is that you may limit supply,” instead of nudging consumption down, he said. He prefers to soften the pain of high energy prices through “redistribution mechanisms,” such as tax credits or welfare payments.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez told POLITICO earlier this week that other radical policy options need to be considered. Sánchez thinks governments need to learn from COVID-19 pandemic responses and coordinate better. “Why don't we centralize gas purchases, as we did with the vaccines?” he said.\n\nNorway, a major fossil fuel exporter, is struggling to balance the effects of Russia’s war in Ukraine alongside the country’s commitment to go green.\n\n“These very high energy prices in Europe are not good for Norway,” Støre said. “These are our allies and partners. We are not served by their economies being rocked,” he added.\n\nWhile high prices drive up Norway’s tax revenues — oil and gas companies pay a 78 percent tax to the Norwegian treasury — they drive up domestic prices too. But Støre is undeterred when it comes to making Norway transition to green energy. “We need to scale up the energy transition,” he said.\n\nSánchez is backing Norway, telling fellow leaders not to get distracted by Russian President Vladimir Putin’s energy tactics: “We have a bigger crisis with climate change,” he told POLITICO.\n\nFor now, that transition is unaffordable in many parts of the world. A new Global Leadership Council, co-chaired by Støre and Rockefeller Foundation President Rajiv Shah, aims to change that.\n\n“Six billion people live in energy poverty, and as long as they are energy poor, that will be a major stumbling block for us moving forward on climate,” Støre said.\n\nThe council met for the first time Wednesday and is part of the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet. Its members include World Bank President David Malpass, International Energy Agency boss Fatih Birol, the heads of development banks and Bank of America’s Anne Finucane.\n\nOther groups in New York for the U.N. General Assembly are pushing to change the tone of climate debates, worried that climate action is increasingly becoming a victim of political polarization.\n\nHannah Jones, CEO of British Prince William's Earthshot Prize for environmental work, said this fear is a driving force behind the prince’s climate activism. “He felt really clearly that if we didn't bring urgent optimism into the conversation, we risk people shutting down on us, and not being able to move forward and not take action,\" Jones said.\n\nThe prince had planned to be in New York to announce the winners of the Earthshot Prize, but the trip was canceled due to the death of his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nFight over the future\n\nThe fraught nature of climate debates was on full display Tuesday.\n\nClimate activist and former U.S. Vice President Al Gore tore into Malpass, demanding his replacement as World Bank president for what Gore described as a lack of climate action at the bank.\n\nSpeaking onstage in New York, Malpass repeatedly declined to say he agreed with the scientific consensus that the planet’s climate is changing dangerously. “I’m not a scientist,” Malpass said.\n\nNon-state actors also launched a deluge of climate commitments Wednesday. Amazon and Water.org announced a partnership to provide access to safe water for 100 million people, while a coalition of large companies including Ikea and Unilever committed to taking their most polluting vehicles off the road, and transitioning toward zero-emissions vehicles by 2040.\n\nAntha Williams, head of Bloomberg Philanthropies, which hosted the Earthshot Innovation Summit Wednesday, said the world needs action at all levels to have any hope of sticking to the Paris climate agreement. “We need multilateral collaboration between nation states now more than ever, but they alone are not going to get it done,” she said.\n\nJones sees the process of identifying the local solutions from Earthshot Prize winners as an important step to change on a bigger scale. \"We are a global search engine. We scour the earth for incredible solutions with an eye to diversity and representation,\" Jones said.\n\nThe goal, she added, is “finding those solutions from the Global South by people that wouldn't be walking down Sand Hill Road [in Silicon Valley] and bumping into a venture capitalist.”\n\nU.N. Secretary-General António Guterres will push national leaders to make further commitments at an informal leaders roundtable on climate action.\n\nStøre offered fulsome praise to the climate efforts of U.S. President Joe Biden, including the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act. “I can only salute him,” Støre said.",

    "How Norway Get So Rich": "How Norway Get So Rich\n\nNorway is one of the wealthiest and most advanced economies in the world.\n\nEdited by the author\n\nIn 2021, Norway’s GDP per capita was 89k dollars, one of the highest in the world.\n\nNorwegian citizens enjoy free education. It continues to rank highest in the happiness index along with Sweden and Denmark.\n\nOver the four or five decades, Norway’s economy had massively transformed and changed itself from fishing to the oil industry.\n\nIn 2022, Norway’s economy ranked 14th in the economic freedom index.\n\nIn Norway, The life expectancy for men is 81 and for women is 84. which ranks 17th in the world. This longevity is because of improved economic growth and a quality healthcare system.\n\nSo what factors led to Norway’s enormous economic growth, which improved the lives of every Norwegian?\n\nOil and Gas Industry\n\nPhoto by Benjamin Massello on Unsplash\n\nNorway is the 12th largest oil-producing nation in the world. It is the fifth largest oil exporter and the third largest gas exporter.\n\nOn 25 Feb 1958, a letter from the geological survey of Norway to the Norwegian ministry of foreign affairs stated that the chances of finding Oil off the Norwegian coastline were negligible.\n\nWhen natural gas reserves were found in the Netherlands, Most people speculated that oil reserves can be located in the north sea.\n\nIn 1963, Norway declared any oil found off its coastline belonged to them. In April 1965, Norway started selling exploration drilling licenses.\n\nPhillips petroleum purchased an exploration license and began drilling. Try after try they were finding nothing, So Philips gave it the last try which will go deeper, and in 1969 the first found oil was extracted from the north sea and was in massive quantity.\n\nNorway was quickly producing more oil per resident than any other country. The oil sector was becoming a booming industry in Norway. thousands of new jobs were created. With the blessing of oil, Norway was transforming itself from an economy based on fishing to an oil-based economy that would bring billions of dollars into the economy.\n\nBut the Norwegian government wanted every Norwegian citizen to reap the profit from the oil discovery, not a private company.\n\nAfter all, it was in Norway land where oil and gas were discovered, So the Norwegian must also get the rewards.\n\nOn 14 June 1972, the Norwegian parliament voted to establish a state-owned oil company Statoil and the Norwegian petroleum directorate as the industry regulator.\n\nIt gave Norway power and benefits over the profit that it would earn from its oil. It created a new source for government spending.\n\nBut Norway was reluctant to spend all the money it was earning from oil revenues because it knew oil won’t last forever. Norway wanted to find a way to secure its wealth when the oil ran out.\n\nSovereign Wealth Fund\n\nIn the 1980s, when oil prices plummeted, and oil-rich economies went into recession.\n\nNorway learned a valuable lesson at that time. When an economy is at the mercy of a single commodity price, It can make the economy highly unstable as the price of a commodity moves up or down. The solution was to diversify and stabilize the economy.\n\nIn 1995, the government established a sovereign wealth fund, also known as the government pension fund of Norway, funded with oil revenues.\n\nMost oil-rich countries remain poor because they started spending more today than saving for tomorrow.\n\nNorway knows that oil will not be there forever. It is a limited resource. They have to stabilize their economy and eliminate oil dependence if they want to remain wealthier in the long term.\n\nThis state-owned investment fund invests in the stock market and financial markets around the world.\n\nThis state-owned investment fund cannot invest in Norway because its purpose is to diversify the Norwegian economy by investing in international businesses. So if an economic recession occurs in Norway, state-owned investment funds are protected from it.\n\nNorway is a perfect example of a person who wins a lottery, and instead of spending all the money today, he saves and puts it in the financial market to grow the money slowly and steadily.\n\nThis method may be dull for most people, but it is the most effective way to build wealth and remain wealthier in the long term.\n\nToday, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund is the largest in the world, with 1.36 trillion dollars in assets.\n\nNorwegian law restricts the government from withdrawing funds funded by oil revenue because that money is for the people of Norway.\n\nThe government can only withdraw a 3% return earned by a fund during a year.\n\nIn December 2021, the fund was worth about 250k dollars per Norwegian citizen.\n\nAlthough, Norway citizens can’t take that money because it is invested in the financial market for the long term to survive without oil.\n\nNorway’s sovereign wealth fund owns 1.5 of all the world’s listed companies. The fund invested in over 9,123 companies in 73 countries.\n\nConclusion\n\nOne of the reasons why most oil-rich countries remain poor is that they tend to spend more today and save less for tomorrow.\n\nThey made their economy heavily dependent on oil, and any downturn in the oil prices takes their economy into crisis.\n\nWhen countries discover large oil reserves, They tend to reduce taxes on citizens and give more money to the people than before.\n\nWhen Government spending is financed by oil revenue, It can go down when the oil price goes down, Which can reduce the control of their economy because they can’t control the oil prices, so when oil prices go down, their public spending goes down with it. Which also slows down the economy.\n\nOil companies would employ a large part of the oil-rich country’s labor force, and when the price of oil goes down, oil companies will cut back on expenses and lay off workers, which can cause economic crises in the oil-rich country.\n\nNorway, despite being blessed with huge oil and gas reserves. It continues to finance its government spending by imposing high taxes on Norwegian citizens. Also, people are willing to pay high taxes for certain benefits like the free quality education system, which made Norway one of the most educated countries in the world.\n\nBenefits of healthcare services could get free if the amount is up to a certain level. in 2021, the amount was 264 USD, and any medical treatment above that amount is given for free and financed by the Norwegian government.\n\nNorway didnt make the mistake of using oil wealth for today and not saving for tomorrow.\n\nThe Norwegian government saves their oil revenue and invests in their state’s investment fund, which would invest in international companies and diversify their wealth from oil.\n\nSo when the oil reserve is no longer, they could depend on their trillion-dollar fund, the largest sovereign wealth fund in the world, This is why Norway gets so rich, and many oil-rich economies remain poor.\n\nPhoto by Oliver Cole on Unsplash\n\nContinue Reading:",

    "What to eat and drink in Norway": "Abundant seafood, regional specialties such as reindeer, and an ever-growing trend towards cutting-edge cooking using hyperlocal, seasonal ingredients make eating in Norway a locavore’s delight. Whatever your favorite flavor of culinary experience, your taste buds are covered here, from Norwegian staples in down-to-earth cafes to up-to-the-minute gastronomic trends in sleek surroundings.\n\nIt’s worth noting that many restaurants change their menus regularly (sometimes weekly), which is excellent for seasonal variety, but it does mean that some famous Norwegian classics might not be available year-round. Here’s what to eat in Norway.\n\nGo wild for reinsdyrstek (roast reindeer)\n\nReindeer is something every non-vegetarian visitor to Norway should try at least once, but you'll likely want to order it again as it’s one of the tastier red meats. It’s exceptionally lean with a gamey flavor, but it’s much milder than venison – have it roasted for a tender treat. It will typically be served with mashed potatoes, peas and lingonberry jam.\n\nThe vast majority of the reindeer in Norway are raised by traditional Sami herders in the north of the country. They’re effectively wild, making reindeer a sustainable, healthy option if you choose to eat meat.\n\nWhere to try it: Unsurprisingly, you’ll find that reindeer is more prevalent on menus the further north you go. Head for Emma’s Drømmekjøkken in Tromsø or Du Verden Matbar in Alta.\n\nGet local insight on destinations all over the world with our weekly newsletter delivered to your inbox.\n\nFish soup is a classic and cozy favorite in coastal Norwegian towns © Olga Mazyarkina / Getty Images / iStockphoto\n\nWarm your frozen fingers with a mug of fiskesuppe (fish soup)\n\nNorwegians are huge fans of this warming soup, generously loaded with chunks of fish such as salmon and cod, shrimp, root vegetables and cream. Given the abundance of the soup’s ingredients locally, it’s often one of the least expensive items on the menu, but it’s no less tasty and filling for it – especially when you mop it up with a hunk of warm fresh bread.\n\nWhere to try it: It’ll be on the menu in restaurants and cafes in any coastal town (and inland, too), but Bryggeloftet is Bergen’s oldest restaurant and a particularly atmospheric option.\n\nFårikål, or lamb stew, is Norway's national dish © kristerleon / Shutterstock\n\nDiscover the simple flavors of fårikål (lamb stew)\n\nThis simple, hearty stew is Norway’s national dish. There are only a few ingredients – various cuts of lamb, lots of cabbage, water, and some salt and pepper – so using top-quality meat and having the patience to let it simmer for hours is what will make for a mouth-watering meal.\n\nFårikål is a comforting family one-pot wonder, usually eaten with boiled potatoes and flatbrød (a kind of crispbread). These days restaurants sometimes offer a twist on the classic, perhaps with extra veggies or by adding beer for a richer flavor.\n\nWhere to try it: Look for restaurants specializing in old-school Norwegian fare, such as Kaffistova in Oslo. It tends to feature on seasonal menus in autumn, and there are few better places to try Norwegian lamb dishes than on Lofoten – try Børsen Spiseri.\n\nCelebrate with a bowl of bidos (Sami reindeer stew)\n\nIn the far north, particularly if you're fortunate enough to be invited to a Sami celebration, you'll come across this traditional stew made with reindeer, carrots and potatoes, all slow cooked together for maximum taste. It’s traditional for Sami people to eat this flavorful meal at weddings and other special occasions.\n\nWhere to try it: You’ll find this dish on restaurant menus across Finnmark, particularly in Kautokeino and Karasjok, home of the Sami parliament. But for the full cultural experience as well as a plate of bidos, plan your trip around Sami Week in Tromsø.\n\nBrunost, or brown cheese, has a caramel-like flavor with a fudge-like texture © Elena Graham / Shutterstock\n\nTry savory-sweet brunost (brown cheese)\n\nMade with whey, cream and goat's and/or cow's milk, brunost isn’t so much a Norwegian staple as a national institution. This (technically-not-cheese) cheese has a tangy yet sweet, caramel flavor and a fudge-like texture.\n\nGudbrandsdalsost (produced by the company Tine) is arguably the most famous kind and is made using a combination of goat's and cow's milk. Geitost uses only goat’s milk, while fløtemysost uses only cow’s milk. Whatever the variety, if you like the unusual taste, eat it for breakfast on a slice of bread or a waffle.\n\nWhere to try it: Pick up a block from Norwegian supermarkets and farm shops or try it at your hotel’s breakfast buffet.\n\nSnack on some chewy tørrfisk (stockfish)\n\nIf you visit the Lofoten Islands, you’ll see row after row of wooden racks laden with Atlantic cod drying for months in the brisk Norwegian air. It’s common to eat tørrfisk as a snack (like a fishy jerky), washed down with some beer. It’s also often rehydrated by soaking it in water, then baked, grilled or used in soups.\n\nWhere to try it: You won’t have any trouble sourcing tørrfisk on Lofoten. Sample the specialty at Bacalao, a casual harbourside place in Svolvær.\n\nSavor the flavor of Gravlaks (cured salmon)\n\nSalmon is ubiquitous in Norway, and this particular incarnation sees it marinated in sugar, salt, brandy and dill, giving it a rich, powerful flavor and a melt-in-the-mouth texture. It’s typically served in thin slices, either with a simple salad or a creamy dill sauce.\n\nWhere to try it: Look out for it at seafood restaurants such as Fisketorget in Stavanger.\n\nNorwegian waffles can be enjoyed with both sweet and savory toppings at any time of day © Michele Ursi / Shutterstock\n\nDiscover that any time is vaffel (waffle) time\n\nThis is a treat you’ll likely be familiar with, but the Norwegians have elevated the humble waffle to top-tier status. Even Oslo’s three-Michelin-starred Maaemo has been known to serve them – gastronomy-style, of course.\n\nThin, fluffy and oh-so-irresistible Norwegian waffles are usually served in heart-shaped slices. Vafler are perfect for breakfast, brunch, as an afternoon snack or for dessert, and are eaten with a variety of sweet and savory toppings. Smother them with your favorite jam, top them with ice cream or add some slices of brunost for double Norway points.\n\nWhere to try them: The proprietor may be Swedish, but that doesn’t stop Haralds Vaffel in Oslo from offering up what could well be the best waffles in the country.\n\nEat elusive multebær (cloudberries)\n\nThese tart amber-colored berries are highly prized and considered a delicacy, growing one per stalk on open swampy ground. The season is fleeting – from July to mid-August – and some cloudberry patches are zealously guarded in Norway. Have them in the decadent dessert multekrem (cloudberry cream) – a confection of cloudberries, whipped cream and sugar – or try warm cloudberry jam dolloped over vanilla ice cream.\n\nWhere to try them: Keep your eyes peeled and forage them when you’re out hiking. Otherwise, pick up some frozen cloudberries or cloudberry jam in Norwegian supermarkets.\n\nThough usually enjoyed on special occasions and holidays, Aquavit is a yearlong favorite spirit in Norway © brittak / Getty Images / iStockphoto\n\nSay skål and supp some aquavit\n\nThe national spirit, aquavit (akevitt in Norwegian), is a potent dose of Norwegian culture made from potatoes and caraway liquor. The name is derived from the Latin aqua vitae, the 'living waters. Although caraway is an essential ingredient, various modern distilleries augment the spicy flavor with any combination of orange, coriander (cilantro), anise, fennel, sugar and salt. Smoother than vodka but nonetheless fiery, the spirit is typically aged for three to five years (sometimes longer) in oak barrels, which give it a caramel color.\n\nNorwegians often drink it on special occasions such as Christmas, Norwegian Constitution Day (17 May) and Midsummer, but it’s perfectly acceptable to quaff it at any time of year.\n\nWhere to try it: Many restaurants and bars carry a large selection of aquavits, including Baklandet Skydsstation in Trondheim. For a truly special experience, book ahead for a tasting session at boutique distillery Inderøy Brenneri at Berg Gård in Inderøy. To buy a bottle to take home, you’ll need to go to one of the state-run liquor stores called Vinmonopolet.\n\nVegetarians and vegans\n\nAs with many European destinations, the availability and quality of vegetarian and vegan options in Norway have improved dramatically in recent years. Most restaurants will offer vegetarian dishes, and, increasingly, many will have a vegan choice, too. Sometimes this may be a simple pasta dish, but you'll also find creative crepes and salads (although vegans won't appreciate the widespread use of cheese).\n\nIn general, the rule is that the larger the town, the more choices there are for animal-free fare. In most cities, you needn’t be limited to just one or two options on a restaurant menu; the selection of specialty vegan and vegetarian restaurants is growing in Norway. Food halls like Oslo Street Food often have a flavorful selection of meat-free, dairy-free dishes from various vendors. Or, for a push-the-boat-out experience, go to Bellies in Stavanger, who have elevated plant-based cuisine to high art.\n\nOther foods worth trying\n\nPinnekjøtt (dried, salted lamb ribs) It’s traditionally eaten at Christmas, so you’ll probably struggle to find pinnekjøtt (pronounced pee-neh-shot) the rest of the year, but don’t pass up the chance to try this salty festive delicacy if you see it on the menu.\n\nLutefisk (dried cod, reconstituted with water and lye) More common in homes than restaurants and something of a staple for older folk, lutefisk is often eaten along with bacon.\n\nRaspeballer (potato dumplings, also called potetball or komle) A welcome starchy accompaniment to many a meat dish.\n\nKjøttkaker (meatballs) Meatballs obviously aren’t unique to Norway, but the Norwegian version (literally translating to ‘meat cakes’) tends to be bigger and come with a generous glug of gravy.\n\nSaltlakris (salty licorice) Also not peculiar to Norway, saltlakris is a Nordic taste sensation. It’s popular in the country as an alternative to sweet candy and as sprinkles for ice cream.\n\nKeeping an eye on your kroner\n\nWe’d be remiss if we didn’t touch on the fact that eating out in Norway can be prohibitively expensive, and even ‘budget’ options will have you counting every krone. Try shifting your main meal to the middle of the day – many great restaurants offer lunch specials that are just as tasty and varied but tend to be kinder on your wallet.",
    "St. Olaf to host Queen Sonja of Norway": "St. Olaf to host Queen Sonja of Norway\n\nHer Majesty Queen Sonja of Norway is set to make a stop at St. Olaf College during a visit meant to highlight the strong ties between Norway and Minnesota’s Norwegian-American community.\n\nDuring her visit to the college on Friday, Oct. 14, Queen Sonja will meet with St. Olaf students, faculty members, the Board of Regents, and members of the Norwegian-American Historical Association.

    "‘Selfish’ Norway accused of Ukraine war-profiteering": "Hansson, a former leader of the Norwegian Green Party, isn’t buying the government’s argument | Hakon Mosvold Larsen/AFP via Getty Images\n\nPress play to listen to this article Voiced by Amazon Polly\n\nOSLO — Norwegian opposition party lawmaker Rasmus Hansson has a harsh message for his country’s government: The war in Ukraine isn’t a fair reason to demand higher gas prices.\n\nSanctions-hit Russia is weaponizing gas deliveries, hoping to hurt Ukraine's EU allies now scrambling to cut their reliance on Russian energy exports. That's sending the price of natural gas soaring — up sevenfold over the last year.\n\nNow Norway has supplanted Russia as the EU's largest source of gas, and torrents of cash are pouring into the country.\n\nOslo expects around €94 billion in net income from its petroleum industry this year, a rise of around €65 billion from last year. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, which manages the country's petroleum earnings, has a current value of around €1.2 trillion, or around €250,000 per citizen.\n\nThat flood of money is turning into both a domestic and a foreign political problem.\n\nThe Nordic state’s center-left government — made up of the Social Democrats and Center Party — says it has shown solidarity with a 1.4 billion cubic meter production hike at three key fields in March, which is sending more gas to the EU. It argues Norway shouldn’t be blamed for market forces beyond its control.\n\nBut Hansson, a former leader of the Norwegian Green Party, isn’t buying the government’s argument.\n\nHe called it “morally wrong” to profit from price rises driven primarily by war and argued that Norway also risks damaging relations with key European trading partners by forcing them to pay such high gas prices.\n\nToo much money?\n\n“We think Norway is being short-sighted and too selfish,” Hansson said in an interview in his office overlooking the parliament in the capital Oslo. “We are getting a windfall profit which is very big, but the question is does that money belong to us as long as the most obvious reason for that price increase and that extra income is the disaster that has befallen the Ukrainian people?”\n\nHansson wants to see the extra money go into a solidarity fund that would be used to rebuild Ukraine after the war. He said experts should set what should be considered a “normal” gas price and everything above that should be seen as war profits and given away.\n\nBrussels has a similar idea. During an emergency summit of EU energy ministers last week, several countries called for setting a price cap on all gas coming into the EU; the European Commission wants such a measure directed only against Russia.\n\nOn Wednesday, Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen said she was discussing a “task force” with Norway to look at “how are we able to lower, in a reasonable manner, the price of gas.”\n\nSo far Norway isn't biting. Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre has repeatedly said he would not back a price cap on gas exports.\n\nHansson is also finding it difficult to get much traction for his idea in the Norwegian parliament, where his party, which only holds three of 169 seats, has met resistance from both the government and other opposition parties.\n\nCommission President Ursula Von der Leyen said she was discussing a “task force” with Norway to look at “how are we able to lower, in a reasonable manner, the price of gas.” | Monasse/Getty Images\n\nBut in other corners of Europe his argument is beginning to resonate.\n\nNorway should share the “gigantic” profits it has made as a result of higher oil and gas prices, especially with Ukraine, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said earlier this year.\n\nTeresa Ribera, Spain’s minister for ecological transition, recently called the prices being paid to Norway for gas “disturbing.”\n\nIn written comments to POLITICO, Norwegian Foreign Minister Anniken Huitfeldt said Europe is facing a supply crisis, and Norway’s primary duty is to pump more gas.\n\n“Norway has been asked by the EU and our European partners to step up its production to cover as much of the shortfall from Russia as we can and we have done our utmost to do so,” Huidfeldt said.\n\nShe said Russia has deliberately distorted gas prices by shutting off supplies to Europe and was seeking to harm European consumers as part of its war against Ukraine. Norway and its European customers have a shared interest in “normalizing the prices and ending the distortion of the energy market,” she said.\n\nHuidfeldt said there were “many suggestions under discussion” but declined to say what those ideas were or which she favored.\n\n“I’m hesitant to go into specific proposals at this time,” Huidfeldt said. “One should carefully evaluate the implications of different measures so that the result is not a reduction of supply or less focus on energy savings.”\n\nMerry Norwegians\n\nSo far neither the cash influx nor the increase in gas prices seems to be worrying many Norwegians.\n\nThe government will allocate about €1 billion for a scheme that pays 90 percent of household electricity bills when wholesale prices rise above prescribed levels.\n\nMeanwhile, the wider economic outlook also appears comparatively benign, with unemployment around 3 percent and house prices still ticking up despite higher interest rates.\n\nOn the streets of Oslo, war and Europe’s energy crisis seem a long way away.\n\nLast week, near the city’s new €225 million museum housing the works of Edvard Munch, bathers enjoyed the last of the summer heat on an artificial beach.\n\nIn a nearby park close to parliament, Penny Heymans, a 76-year-old pensioner, handed out anti-war leaflets for a group called Grandmothers for Peace.\n\nShe said she was struggling to get much attention from passersby and she noted that Norwegians seemed happy to accept the gas price windfall and not question the deteriorating regional security picture behind it.\n\n“People are not really that engaged in what’s going on,” she said. “They feel like they are doing fine so why bother rocking the boat.”\n\nHansson, for one, is bothered that Norwegians seem unwilling to question their own good fortune.\n\n“It’s probably not good for people to be too rich,” he said. “They start to think they have a God-given right to stay that way.”",

    "Norway says ‘no’ to a gas price cap": "One implication of the Russian gas shut-off is that Norway has now become the EU’s largest single supplier of natural gas. According to the country’s energy ministry, they are expected to export 122 billion cubic metres of gas south to the EU over the course of 2022. This compares with the 155 billion cubic metres of gas which the union imported from Russia in 2021. Getting gas from Norway is obviously preferable to Russia: Norway is a friendly country, and Nato ally, and has gone out of its way to facilitate as much exports to the EU as possible. Over the summer, the country’s government effectively put a stop to a strike by gas platform workers that would have cut exports by around 60 per cent.\n\nBut Norway isn’t doing this out of the kindness of its heart. The Norwegian government and Equinor, the state-owned oil and gas company formerly known as Statoil, have struck rich. In the second quarter of this year, the firm made $17.6 billion (£15.2 billion) in pre-tax earnings, and returned $3 billion (£2.6 billion) to its shareholders. Since the Norwegian government owns two thirds of Equinor’s shares, that’s a pickup of $2 billion (£1.75 billion) in three months, or about $372 (£322) for each Norwegian man, woman and child.\n\nNaturally, Equinor’s cash-strapped buyers have looked at this windfall profit, and wondered if their northern neighbours might show some solidarity. But while the Norwegian government has said it would like to help, it has poured cold water on the idea of doing it through a discount on the price of gas. Jonas Gahr Støre, Norway’s prime minister, said of price negotiations that\n\n\n\n\n\n‘We enter the talks with an open attitude, but are sceptical about a maximum price for gas. A maximum price will not do anything about the fundamental problem, namely that there is too little gas in Europe.’\n\nHis point here is twofold. Firstly, liquefied natural gas imports still account for more of the EU’s gas consumption than Norwegian pipeline-supplied gas does. Capping the price of that gas is practically impossible unless governments or the EU agree to pay the difference between the cap and whatever the prevailing market price for gas is, like the UK has done.\n\nSecondly, some sort of price signal maintenance is arguably important to ensure buyers reduce the demand, since the problem is in fact not having enough gas. If you don’t let prices do that, the alternative is rationing.\n\nWhile talks between Norway and the EU continue, it’s probably safe not to expect any price-capping. The Norwegian government is clearly not keen to limit its revenues in order to support what they see as a pointless endeavour. The broader lesson here is that there will be no easy answers to the energy crisis’s economic impact. The EU will collectively face tough decisions, and asking allies for help can only go so far.\n\nGot something to add? Join the discussion and comment below.",

One visitor also found an extraordinary place to stay for a working vacation.\n\nNorwegians are fond of saying: “There’s no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothes”. The same goes for accommodation.\n\nIdeal location for a working vacation. Photo: Thomas Hornall.\n\nDuring a weekend getaway to Storfjorden in May, the rain fell in great sideways sheets, killing any hopes my partner and I had of long hikes.\n\nAfter months working in a Glasgow office, I dreaded being stuck inside. But even with dark-sky downpours, we spent the day safely cocooned in one of four glass-walled cabins, nestled between towering mountains.\n\nAn extraordinary escape\n\nWe stayed at Kilsti Compact Lodge, near the town of Eidsdal in the north west Sunnmøre region. It was recently featured on Channel 4’s Extraordinary Escapes in the UK.\n\nThe resort enjoys awe-inspiring panoramic views over the Storfjord and into the World Heritage Tafjord. I felt my clenched-fist mind relaxing rapidly with the dramatic beauty of the landscape.\n\nTafjord in Norway.\n\nDespite the rain – which would typically ruin my trip – we loved sitting inside our oasis reading, chatting, listening to music and watching the granite showers sweep by the fog-shrouded peaks.\n\nEven with unlucky weather, the little comforts here still made our trip well worthwhile.\n\nThey included a glass-windowed sauna (I came out a new man), a kitchenette, Wi-Fi, Hästens horsehair double beds, a glass panel in the bedroom roof for stargazing and a great outdoor area including a fire pit for grilling.\n\nKilsti Compact Lodge near Eidsdal. Photo: Thomas Hornall.\n\nAnother little detail I loved is the darkened glass in the wetroom, allowing you to enjoy the stunning view while showering without being seen from the outside.\n\nUnfortunately, it was too wet and unpredictable to go rafting in the valley of Valdallen, or complete one of the many hikes in the local area.\n\nA detour to Geiranger\n\nInstead, we drove around half an hour to the World Heritage site Geirangerfjord, widely considered Norway’s “jewel in the crown”.\n\nGeiranger and the Geirangerfjord. Photo: David Nikel.\n\nOne of the country’s most famous images, it stretches more than 20km and is surrounded by mountain peaks and steep cliff faces, all cut through by gushing waterfalls, including the “Seven Sisters”.\n\nThe town of Geiranger itself is charming and busy with sightseers.

Photo: Thomas Hornall.\n\nThe cabin living area is roomy and comfortable with a table as a makeshift desk, while the sliding doors are perfect to let in some immaculate mountain air if it gets a bit warm. I also found the backdrop excellent for sparking creativity.\n\nWhen it gets snowy, by all accounts there’s still plenty to do here, including freeride powder skiing, cross-country skiing, and even guided snowshoe walks.\n\nLike everything in Norway, it’s not exactly cheap, but a nights’ stay for two comes in around $300-350 per night (up to $390 in the high season of June-Aug) which I found reasonable enough.\n\nMy cluttered mind underwent the mental equivalent of a Marie Kondo clean-up, everything put back into its rightful place through the natural beauty of this area.\n\nElsewhere in the Storfjord region\n\nOne of Norway’s best-known scenic drives, the snaking mountain road Trollstigen (The Troll’s Path), is around an hours’ drive north.\n\nIt’s also around a 30km drive to the Tafjord, the site of a devastating tsunami in 1934.\n\nFirst up on my next visit to the region will be a drive on the Atlantic Road, an engineering marvel dubbed “the world’s most beautiful drive”, which takes you right out to the ocean’s edge.",
    "Granath v Wright: Systematic bullying of Craig Wright slammed as Norway trial concludes": "The Granath v Wright trial in Norway is over, with much of the trial’s final day spent with Halvor Manshaus and Halvard Helle of Schjodt giving their closing arguments for Dr. Craig Wright’s defense. The outcome is now in the hands of the Judge.\n\nBut first, the plaintiffs finished their own closing arguments. Ørjan Salvesen Haukaas of DLA Piper was dismissive of the witness testimony provided by the defense, saying the only witness who corroborated Dr. Wright’s story was Stefan Matthews, whose strong self-interest in Dr Wright’s identity as Satoshi Nakamoto means his statement is “absolutely not trustworthy whatsoever.”\n\n“In total, based on the evidence, we find that the court must find proven that Mr. Wright has not written the Bitcoin white paper, has not written the Bitcoin code, and never had access to Satoshi Nakamoto’s private keys or their Bitcoin,” Haukaas said.\n\nHaukaas quoted from case law to argue that Granath’s statement was not remarkable on the internet or on Twitter. As a public figure, Dr. Wright must tolerate more than others might, and that this was especially so given Dr. Wright’s own use of language online.\n\nThen came Manshaus and Aarseth’s closing arguments, which among other things amounted to a scathing review of Granath’s tweets and the case he put forward against Dr. Wright these past days in Oslo.\n\nManshaus said that this wasn’t a case where Granath made a single statement in the context of a heated, reciprocal debate: it was a lasting, well thought through and reckless campaign designed for others to take part. Dr. Wright was called a scammer, a fraud, and mentally ill: “Quite simply, this is bullying put into a system.”\n\nManshaus had powerful words against Granath’s justification—that there is already a wide consensus that Dr. Wright is a fraud—delivered via his own testimony and that of the three crypto ‘experts’ he produced. “As we see it,” Manshaus told the court, “the only consensus is an understanding between bullies that hunt together.”\n\nGranath’s other justifications similarly fall away. The idea that these words are ‘okay’ because it’s the internet, or it’s how people talk on crypto Twitter, were contradicted by Granath’s own witnesses, none of whom would endorse Granath’s use of language and tone.\n\nManshaus said that Granath’s statements are not exonerated by the European Convention on Human Rights’ protection over freedom of expression. Granath’s campaign was in part designed to strangle debate and suppress Dr. Wright’s ability to take part in it.\n\nHalvard Helle said that there are layers of rationalizations from Granath’s side which must be “peeled off.” At the end of the day, it was pure hate speech online: while Dr. Wright has engaged in debate through Twitter and in person, that has never been the case with Granath. Before Granath decided to launch his campaign against Dr. Wright, the two had never interacted.\n\n“For [Dr Wright], this came as lightning from a clear sky,” said Helle.\n\nGranath’s claimed factual bases for his statements were also rebutted. Things like Granath’s reference to the ATO documents from Kleiman are irrelevant to this question if Granath didn’t have those things in his mind when he labelled Dr. Wright a swindler and a fraud.\n\nOn the contrary, Helle and Manshaus both made the point that Dr. Wright had presented documentary evidence to the court as well as first-hand witnesses who are far better placed to testify about Dr Wright’s often mysterious history than Granath’s experts. And the people who were actually present for the only proof Dr. Wright has yet been willing to conduct—Jon Matonis and Gavin Andresen—both were convinced. Where a common refrain from Granath’s witnesses was that Dr. Wright was not at all what they imagined as Satoshi, Gavin Andresen had said that he found Dr Wright’s ‘prickly’ personality to accord very well with his own image of Satoshi—and who would know better than Andresen?\n\nHelle also highlighted the method to Granath’s madness online: to behave as provokingly and shockingly as possible in order to spread his message in the most efficient way possible. This can be seen from his tweets about Wright, but also from the rest of his Twitter timeline. Helle showed the court tweets from Granath which had the former school teacher asking why “Putin, Assad and Ahmadinejad make so much more sense than Western leaders,” and saying it was “hard to verify how many Hitler had killed.”\n\nNow, we wait\n\nThe seven days spent in court have been illuminating. We finally heard from the man in charge of the Hodlonaut account in person, giving a window into what was behind his social media campaign against Dr. Wright.\n\nIt wasn’t pretty. Putting flirtations with Holocaust denial aside, the court saw that Granath’s Twitter campaign has given oxygen to widespread attacks on Dr. Wright—both personally and commercially—perpetrated by the likes of the Bitcoin Plebs group that Granath was grilled about during his testimony on Wednesday.\n\nHowever, the court also saw something more positive: Dr. Wright’s associates from his former life as an audit professional giving sworn testimony about their experience with Dr. Wright, with some going as far as to fly from Australia to Norway to do so. All were effusive in their praise of Dr. Wright’s technical skill and professional competence, and each had interesting details about the kinds of things Dr. Wright was working on and talking about in the lead up to Bitcoin’s public reveal: blockchain based security systems, permissionless payments and the need for a global platform of digital cash that could be used by anybody. This is to say nothing of the testimony from Dr. Wright’s cousin, Max Lynam, who swore that he and his father had run the Bitcoin software on their home computer from 2008 until the end of 2011.\n\nThe contrast between the case of the plaintiff and that of the defendant couldn’t have been starker, but it makes sense: Granath’s narrative is based in cryptoland, where highly cynical and offensive groups like Bitcoin Plebs are a fact of life, and cursory internet sleuthing can credibly stand-in for hard evidence and eye witness testimony. On the other hand, Dr. Wright’s represents a dose of the reality that the rest of the world lives in, where the word of highly credentialed professionals and civil servants are given weight over that of faceless critics hiding behind Twitter accounts.\n\nHow the Oslo District Court will weight all of this is yet to be seen. The Judge indicated that a judgment might come in early November, so the answer may not be far off.\n\nWatch Granath vs Wright Satoshi Norway Trial Coverage Livestream Day 7:\n\nwidth=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\n\nNew to Bitcoin?

But as summer turns to autumn (“høst” in Norwegian), another kind of beauty spreads across the landscape.\n\nThe Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Terra satellite acquired an image (left) on September 20, 2022. Though the calendar said it was the final day of summer, many of the trees, shrubs, and grasses had turned from green to autumnal brown and gold.\n\nFor comparison, the second image (right) shows the same area on June 29, 2022. In this early-summer view, acquired by MODIS on NASA’s Aqua satellite, snow was still melting away and vegetation was greening in the summer sunlight.\n\nTrees and shrubs change color when cooler air temperatures and fewer sunlit hours trigger them to slow and stop the production of chlorophyll—the molecule that plants use to synthesize food. As the green pigment fades, various yellow and red pigments become visible.\n\nColors change early in Norway’s northern latitudes, as sunlight wanes faster and cooler air temperatures arrive sooner. Elevation matters too. Cooler temperatures upland generally cause vegetation to change color on the mountains before descending into the valleys.\n\nIn some places, green will linger. Forests of evergreen trees, such as spruce and pine, are common in glacial valleys, especially in eastern Norway. But among these forests there are color-changing deciduous trees mixed in, such as birch, ash, rowan, and aspen.\n\nClear satellite views of Norway are uncommon, as the region is frequently covered by clouds. And views of autumn color here are especially fleeting. Snow is already beginning to cover more of the Scandinavian Mountains compared to late August, and it will eventually blanket most of the region.\n\nNASA Earth Observatory images by Lauren Dauphin, using MODIS data from NASA EOSDIS LANCE and GIBS/Worldview.

    "Norway and the Geopolitics of Battery Minerals – PRIO Blogs": "Batteries are as essential to the “green” energy transition as wind parks, solar power, and electric cars. These green energy technologies all require vast amounts of minerals. Norway has the potential to be an important new supplier of batteries, but it has been surprisingly silent on the issue – until now.\n\nFor some years, experts worldwide have pointed to a discrepancy between supply and demand in minerals critical for the ‘green’ energy transition. Commodities like lithium, graphite, cobalt, and nickel are essential to produce batteries. But the global Covid-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine have pointed to serious bottlenecks in the supply of these critical minerals.\n\nChina has dominated the battery supply chain and is expanding its control over the various steps in that chain, from mining to refining to manufacturing batteries in China and abroad. Mining is often concentrated in poorer countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where 70% of the world’s cobalt is sourced. Such concentration heightens the dependency of European industries on resource-rich countries. The war in Ukraine has further aggravated mineral and metal supply issues, as Russian nickel supplies are now largely off-limits to Western battery manufacturers. Mineral self-sufficiency in Europe seems like a pipe dream, given the few mining sources and refining projects that currently exist on the continent.\n\nArendal … is also one of three sites where large-scale battery cell production is planned.\n\nTo address this highly political and strategic issue, the European Union has been mapping supply chains in order to develop strategies to access these materials. And Norway has begun to address the issue of the geopolitics of critical mineral supply. At this year’s Arendalsuka, an annual political festival, the topic added some pepper to last year’s battery euphoria. The southern Norwegian town of Arendal not only hosts Norway’s democratic dance floor, as the festival often is called, it is also one of three sites where large-scale battery cell production is planned. With the aim to make Norway nothing less than a “green industrial and energy giant” through battery production and other “green” technologies, the Norwegian government launched its battery strategy in June 2022.\n\nHow does Norway approach the critical raw material challenge?\n\nThe Minister of Trade and Industry, Jan Christian Vestre, not only wants Norway to become a battery giant but also a sustainable mining nation. His ministry is currently developing a new mineral strategy which promises both more mining as well as recycling of minerals and metals. However, the few planned mining projects are contested. A “less visible” form of extraction proposed is seabed mining, spearheaded by the Petroleum Directorate. Internationally, though, this type of mining is highly disputed and not recommended by the EU.\n\nAs in many other European countries, establishing a robust mining sector in Norway will take time, is politically challenging due to its impacts, and would probably not satisfy the expected demand in time. Realistically, that leaves the Norwegian battery actors relying on raw materials from outside Europe for some time.\n\nIn a panel debate on critical raw materials at Arendalsuka, Parliamentarian and former Minister of Climate and Environment, Ola Elvestuen (V) acknowledged that the East-West polarisation will make cooperation on mineral and metal supplies unavoidable: “We will have to be more strategic in our partnerships with Africa, South America and Southeast Asia. That is an essential component in the biggest challenge we are in, to protect freedom and democracy and to reach our climate goals”.\n\nIt remains to be seen what role strategic partnerships will be given when Norway’s mineral strategy is launched later this year. Despite the wish to be more self-reliant, we should be realistic and recognise Norway’s dependence on mining elsewhere, particularly in the Global South, if battery production is to become a relevant industry for the country.\n\nAnna-Sophie Hobi is a PhD candidate at NMBU and associated with the Green Curses project at PRIO.",

    "Indonesia and Norway give REDD+ deal another go after earlier breakup": "Indonesia and Norway have embarked on another REDD+ scheme that will see the latter pay the former to keep its forests standing, after a previous attempt failed because of lack of payment.\n\nIndonesia is home to the third-largest expanse of tropical rainforest in the world, and the bulk of its greenhouse gas emissions comes from land-use change, forest degradation, and deforestation.\n\nOfficials from both countries say it’s of mutual benefit to both countries, and to the world, to preserve Indonesia’s forests boost their capacity to sequester carbon from the atmosphere.\n\nUnder the new deal, payments still outstanding from the previous agreement, which was terminated in 2021, will be honored.\n\nJAKARTA — Indonesia has signed a new climate deal with Norway that will see the Nordic country pay the Southeast Asian one to keep its forests standing. The deal comes a year after Indonesia terminated a nearly identical scheme between the two countries over the lack of payments.\n\nLand-use change, forest degradation, and deforestation account for the bulk of Indonesia’s greenhouse gas emissions. The idea behind the new deal (and the previous one) is that by slowing or outright preventing forest loss, Indonesia will be able to preserve what’s currently the third-biggest expanse of tropical rainforest on Earth (behind the Amazon and the Congo Basin). Measurable progress on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, a mechanism known as REDD+, will then be eligible for payment under the deal with Norway.\n\nThe new partnership is enshrined in a memorandum of understanding signed by Indonesia’s minister of environment and forestry, Siti Nurbaya Bakar, and Norway’s minister of climate and environment, Espen Barth Eide, on Sept. 12.\n\nSiti said the intention to form a new partnership was conveyed by Norway in a letter dated Aug. 5.\n\n“Indonesia under the leadership of [President] Jokowi [Joko Widodo] has made great strides and I have to happily announce that we see Indonesia as a world leader on global issues that we’re discussing today,” Eide said. “It’s good for Indonesia, it’s good for Norway, it’s good for the planet because all of our efforts to reduce our emissions from energy, from the industry, from transport, would all be in vain if we don’t look after the carbon sink we already have.”\n\nRewarded for reducing emissions\n\nThe centerpiece of Indonesia’s forest policy is its “FOLU Net Sink 2030 Operational Plan,” an ambitious bid to transform its forests into a major carbon sink by 2030, absorbing 140 million metric tons more CO2 than they emit into the atmosphere.\n\nIndonesia has long been among the world’s top emitters of greenhouse gases from deforestation, forest fires and peatland destruction, but its deforestation rate has declined in recent years. According to official data, Indonesia’s deforestation rate in 2019/2020 was 115,500 hectares (285,400 acres), an almost 90% drop from 1.09 million hectares (2.69 million acres) in 2014/2015.\n\nThis progress came during the period when the previous agreement between Indonesia and Norway, signed in 2010, was still in place.\n\nIn 2019, Norway agreed to pay 530 million krone ($56 million) for Indonesia preventing the emission of 11.23 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) through REDD+ in 2017. But by 2021, Norway still hadn’t paid, prompting Indonesia to terminate the REDD+ agreement.\n\n“Indonesia and Norway had cooperation on environment, with REDD+ agreement in 2010, and it was very unfortunate [that] we cannot continue this cooperation,” Indonesia’s foreign minister, Retno Marsudi, said during a joint press conference with Norwegian officials in Jakarta on Sept. 12. “But we learned a lot from the REDD+ cooperation and continue to be constructive in our engagement.”\n\nBuilding on their long-standing partnership on environmental issues and past experiences, Norway and Indonesia have entered a new agreement, Eide said.\n\n“[We are] learning from our shared experience in the past and moving towards something that I think is really and genuinely promising,” he said at the press conference.\n\nBustar Maitar, CEO of Indonesian environmental NGO EcoNusa Foundation, said he’s optimistic the new climate partnership will further strengthen efforts to achieve the FOLU Net Sink target by 2030 and other climate actions.\n\nWhat to expect\n\nThe details of the new deal will be ironed out in a new contribution agreement, set to be signed in the next three to four weeks, Eide said.\n\n“And I would like to underline that this is just around the corner and that this is very promising work based on the MOU that we needed to sign in order to complete the contribution agreement,” he said.\n\nWhat’s clear, though, is that Norway’s International Climate and Forest Initiative (NICFI) will channel the payments directly to Indonesia’s Environment Fund. And the $56 million outstanding that Norway had agreed to pay Indonesia back in 2019 will be paid under the new partnership.\n\nEide said Norwegian payments for Indonesia’s REDD+ achievements made from 2016/2017 to 2019/2020 will be based on the existing measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) protocol, a system set up by Indonesia to account for its progress in reducing emissions.\n\nPayments for results generated from 2020/2021 onward will be based on a mutually agreed updated MRV protocol.\n\n“The first results-based contribution will amount to USD 56 million for verified emission reductions in the forest year” 2016/2017, or August 2016 through July 2017, Norway’s Ministry for Climate and Environment said in a press statement. “Additional results-based contributions will be [made] annually as emission reductions are verified for subsequent years.”\n\nThe new partnership differs in scope from the previous Indonesia-Norway REDD+ agreement, according to Indonesia’s environment minister Siti.\n\n“It is not just about the result-based contribution agreement, it encompasses a broader engagement on climate and forest issues in Indonesia,” she said at the press conference. “The MOU is also to emphasize the importance of deliverable, tangible and direct benefits for the community, and for the progress of Indonesia.”\n\nTo prevent this new deal from being abruptly terminated like the last one, it will be based on mutual respect and mutual understanding, complete with an MRV protocol that’s mutually agreed on by the two countries, said Dida Migfar Ridha, the head of foreign partnerships at Indonesia’s environment ministry.\n\n“This [partnership] is built together in accordance to Indonesia’s characteristics. For instance, we’re based on local community and Indigenous peoples, [and] we have internal regulations [on those issues],” he said on the sidelines of the press conference. “What’s most important is mutual trust and respect by paying attention to existing regulations, especially since [the new partnership] is carried out in Indonesia.”\n\nBanner image: Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae).

    "UK trumpets roaming caps for travellers to Norway, Iceland and – maybe one day – Liechtenstein": "U.K. residents travelling to Norway or Iceland will soon have their mobile roaming fees capped, representing part of a recent trade agreement between the countries.\n\nThe U.K. signed a free trade agreement last July with Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, a triumvirate of markets notable for the fact that they are not members of the European Union (EU), but the adjacent European Economic Area (EEA), which essentially extends the EU single market to a handful of additional countries in the European Free Trade Association (EFTA).\n\nPost-Brexit Britain\n\nEU and EEA residents have been able to use their domestic data, voice and SMS bundle allowances throughout the region since new roaming pricing rules came into effect back in 2017, which was a major game-changer for tourists and business travellers alike. However, with its official exit from the EU in January 2020, those rules no longer applied to U.K. residents, leaving it up to individual mobile networks to decide whether to charge excesses for those traveling abroad. While some networks did promise not to change anything, the reality is that most have reintroduced some form of charges or restrictions — meanwhile, the EU recently committed to keeping roaming fees at bay for another decade.\n\nSo it’s against that backdrop that the U.K.’s latest announcement will likely be met with something akin to a cold shrug. It’s also worth noting that the agreement doesn’t necessarily ditch roaming fees completely, as it merely “caps” the charges — no information has been provided on what these caps will be.\n\nThe resulting legislation from this agreement isn’t expected to be in place until next year, after which the U.K. said that it plans to “work with mobile operators to ensure that the savings secured from this cap are filtered down to consumers.”\n\nA curious omission in all of this is the Principality of Liechtenstein, which while part of the free trade agreement signed last year, doesn’t in fact feature in this roaming pact. The reason, apparently, is due to Liechtenstein not being party to “mobile roaming provisions due to their capacity.” The U.K. is keen to point out that this could change at a future point in time. So that’s something.",
    "Pulpit Rock: How To Get To Preikestolen In Norway": "Norway's iconic Preikestolen hike is one of the most popular day trips from Stavanger, especially among international visitors. Here are your options for how to get to Pulpit Rock.\n\nHiking the mountains and fjords of Norway has long attracted people from across the world to Scandinavia. Fuelled by photos shared on social media, Pulpit Rock is somewhere that has achieved new levels of popularity over the last two decades.\n\nIt's absolutely one of the most popular day trips from Stavanger. While you can't describe the Preikestolen hike as easy, it's far from extreme and also much shorter than many of Norway's other most famous hikes at about 3 hours roundtrip.\n\nThis makes it an extremely attractive travel destination for those visiting Stavanger and the fjord Norway region.\n\nTo make the most of your time, planning how to get from Stavanger to the Preikestolen trailhead is something that should be done in advance. Several tour operators run bus trips to Pulpit Rock, or you can make your own way there.\n\nBefore I go on, I'll just briefly mention the name. The Norwegian name for the clifftop is Preikestolen but the English name Pulpit Rock is just as commonly used by tour guides and the travel industry. We'll refer to both in this article.\n\nWhere is Pulpit Rock?\n\nAlthough often listed as one of the best things to do in Stavanger, Preikestolen is actually quite some distance away.\n\nThe clifftop overlooks the Lysefjord to the east of Stavanger. By car, the trailhead is about 39km from downtown Stavanger, so getting there needs some thought.\n\nOf course, a Preikestolen hike doesn't have to be a day trip. It's also possible to stay near the trailhead in lodges, cabins or campsites, or by wild camping in the surrounding areas.\n\nHow to get from Stavanger to Pulpit Rock\n\nI'm going to assume that most people planning the hike are going to be basing themselves in Stavanger. With lots of other things to do such as exploring the picturesque old town, Stavanger is a great choice as a base.\n\nWhen researching this trip, you may find some out of date information that talks of complicated journeys involving a ferry.\n\nWhile the ferry between Stavanger and Tau does still run, the journey to Preikestolen no longer requires it. Since its opening in December 2019, the 14.4km-long subsea Ryfylke Tunnel has made getting to the trailhead from Stavanger easier than ever.\n\nPreikestolen by car\n\nIf you have a car, driving to the trailhead is now easy and ferry-free via the Ryfylke tunnel. It should take about 40 minutes to complete the 38km journey. Bear in mind there is quite a hefty toll payment for the tunnel.\n\nPreikestolen Fjellstue and the parking lot at the Pulpit Rock trailhead.\n\nLeave Stavanger by crossing the Stavanger City Bridge on route 13 towards the north. You'll soon come to the Ryfylke Tunnel. Once through the tunnel, keep driving through Jørpeland and watch for the left turn on to the signed road up to the Preikestolen trailhead.\n\nParking can be an issue at high season, so plan to arrive early. There are 1,000 spaces managed by the Preikestolen 365 Foundation, together with 20 electric charging stations.\n\nAccording to the Foundation, “on the busiest days, the parking areas fill up and can be temporarily closed in the middle of the day.”\n\nParking costs NOK 250 for the day for cars, while electric car charging also comes with a fee. If you are staying at some of the trailhead accommodation, they may offer free parking.\n\nPreikestolen by bus tour\n\nAt least two companies run bus tours to Preikestolen from Stavanger. While they may seem expensive, such tours can be more convenient than driving and do offer value when you consider all road tolls and parking fees.\n\nNote that these trips are not guided hikes. They are bus transport to the trailhead only. Transport must be booked online in advance.\n\nSign on the trail to Pulpit Rock.\n\nThe best known bus transport is offered by Go Fjords. They offer departures from central Stavanger at 8am, with a matching return departure from the Preikestolen trailhead at 2pm. There is also a 10am/4pm departure.\n\nPulpit Rock Tours offer more departures and a more flexible return system. This is an option worth considering if you are planning an overnight stay.\n\nPreikestolen by public bus\n\nIf you are on a budget, there is a public bus that gets you most of the way to Preikestolen. Part of public transport in Stavanger, bus 100 operated by Kolombus runs throughout the day from central Stavanger to Jørpelandsvågen in Jørpeland.\n\nFrom Jørpeland, you would need to walk 8km (with a substantial uphill stretch) to Basecamp or take a taxi. The cost of a taxi will likely negate any savings you made by taking the public bus.\n\nOf course, you could thumb a lift from others heading to Pulpit Rock, but you do this at your own risk.\n\nStaying overnight at Pulpit Rock\n\nIf you are on a bus tour or drive yourself mid-morning from Stavanger, you're going to find the trail busy. Many keen hikers choose to camp close to the trailhead or along the trail itself in order to get the best possible experience in the morning or evening.\n\nAlso known as Basecamp, Preikestolen Fjellstue is the best-known accommodation at the trailhead. The striking architecture of the mountain lodge is an attractive place to stay the night before an early hike, or the night after an evening hike.\n\nAccommodation is basic yet fitted to a high standard. You can rent equipment such as hiking jackets, boots, poles and snow shoes should you forget to bring anything, or should weather conditions not be as your expected. Parking is free for guests.\n\nOther accommodation close to the trailhead includes Hikers' Camp, which is managed by Basecamp and offers 24 wooden tents. Mattresses are provided but guests must bring their own sleeping bags.\n\nThere's also some accommodation farther away in Jørpeland. About 4km away from the trailhead, Preikestolen Camping offers year-round space for pitching your tent or parking your campervan, caravan or RV."
