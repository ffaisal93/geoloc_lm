    "Chile baloney": "What a lot of baloney Will Lilley writes in saying Allende ‘brought it upon himself’ when he was overthrown in a military coup by the brutal General Pinochet, backed by Henry Kissinger and the CIA in Chile, 1973.\n\nAllende was the first socialist president to be elected democratically through the ballot box in South America. That is, he and his colleagues played the game of the ruling class, the colonial powers of the US, France, the UK, and Australia. And won the election fair and square. Thisy represented the expressed ardent desire of the majority of the Chilean people to distribute the wealth of their country much more fairly amongst the people. That did not sit well with the wealthy elite and American corporations used to ripping off Chile. So they backed Pinochet and the CIA’s coup against Allende. The ‘communistas’ had to be destroyed, rooted out like they were vermin, for fear Allende’s example, like the Sandinista revolution and ‘Poder Popular’ (People Power) in Nicaragua a decade later, would spread to other impoverished nations of South and Central America, and other poor nations of the world.\n\nI was in Chile making a film in 1985 and I had firsthand experience of the murderous nature of Pinochet’s secret police who detained and tortured; they even used Alsatian dogs trained to rape women political prisoners. After the coup in ’73, Pinochet and his feared secret police rounded up ‘leftists’ like me (and many others in our Byron community) and tortured and ‘disappeared’ them. These were artists, writers, journalists, Montessori school teachers, architects, actors, and musicians who dared to want a better world for themselves and their kids. The murdered ‘leftists’ children, like the Stolen Generation here, were adopted out to childless Chilean army officers and the wealthy elite, never told who their real parents were.\n\nWill Lilley, in the ‘democracy’ (!) we live with here in Australia, you are free to peddle your sympathies for murderous fascists like Pinochet, Kissinger, Soeharto in Murdoch’s rags – he’ll believe you. He’s part of the mega-rich and ruling elite of the world. But please, don’t defile The Echo’s pages with your re-writing of history and denigrating the struggle and sacrifice of their lives by the Chilean people – a process they are still actively engaged in today with re-writing Pinochet’s Constitution.\n\nDavid Bradbury, Wilsons Creek\n\n♦ Read Damian Kassabgi’s response here.",
    "Chile: Improve productivity, social protection and boost revenues for a sustainable recovery, says OECD": "23/09/2022 - Chile has achieved an impressive recovery from the COVID-19 crisis, but the pandemic has hampered past progress in reducing poverty and social disparities.\n\n\n\n\n\nChile needs structural reforms to boost productivity, social protection and tax revenues, while tackling short-term challenges such as high inflation, according to a new OECD report.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latest OECD Economic Survey of Chile welcomes progress on significant reforms including a universal basic pension and plans for a fairer tax system which can generate higher revenues. Measures to drive higher productivity, improve competitiveness, get more Chileans into quality jobs and to improve social protection coverage should also be a priority, the Survey says.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Chile is taking important steps towards strengthening its tax base and is closing gaps in social protection,” OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann said, presenting the Survey in Santiago alongside Minister of Finance Mario Marcel. “Complementary reforms to raise productivity and investment would help to generate stronger growth, more jobs and deliver additional income to enable Chile to invest further in economic and social progress.”\n\n\n\n\n\nChile’s solid institutions and prudent management of public finances enabled a strong fiscal response to the pandemic and a vigorous recovery. The Chilean economy grew by 11.9% in 2021, far outpacing OECD and regional peers. The Survey projects growth slowing to 1.9% in 2022 as global growth slows and inflation, now at a 30-year high, curtails purchasing power. Thanks to a swift monetary policy response, inflation should return to target in early 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nChile’s tax revenues at just 21% of GDP are very low by international standards, with close to a third of the workforce in informal jobs with only a fifth of Chileans paying personal income tax. The Survey welcomes a planned reform which would bring the tax intake closer to the Latin American and OECD averages of 28% and 34% respectively. Greater tax revenues would help strengthen the resilience of public finances and importantly help finance rising social needs.\n\n\n\n\n\nChile’s longer-term growth outlook will depend on its ability to address structural growth bottlenecks including weak competition and low investment in research and development to promote innovation.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter many years of convergence, Chile’s income and productivity gap to advanced economies is again widening. The Survey recommends simplifying cumbersome regulations and licensing procedures which hold back new firm entry and investment, increasing investment in new technologies and expanding access to high-quality education.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is also scope to diversify Chile’s exports, still dominated by the mining industry, and to improve trade facilitation and the efficiency of border procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\nChile has one of Latin America’s most comprehensive social protection systems, but the pandemic highlighted gaps in coverage, particularly for informal workers. Enhancing social protection coverage for all, including via pensions, access to health services and basic income support, can help to reduce these gaps. The Survey recommends raising pension levels while applying progressive contribution rates and unifying social assistance programmes to achieve a wider coverage. Future social benefit reforms should also pay particular attention to how they affect the incentives for creating formal jobs.\n\n\n\n\n\nChile is making significant progress on sustainable energy, with renewable sources now accounting for 47% of electricity generation as solar and wind energy have gained importance. Looking ahead, Chile has a much higher potential in renewable energy generation, far exceeding domestic needs.\n\nSee an overview of the Survey with key findings, charts and summaries in English and Spanish (this link can be included in media articles)\n\nFor further information, journalists are invited to contact Catherine Bremer in the OECD Media Office (+33 1 45 24 80 97).\n\nWorking with over 100 countries, the OECD is a global policy forum that promotes policies to preserve individual liberty and improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.",
    "‘It’s a miracle’: Gran Abuelo in Chile could be world’s oldest living tree": "In a secluded valley in southern Chile, a lone alerce tree stands above the canopy of an ancient forest.\n\nGreen shoots sprout from the crevices in its thick, dark trunks, huddled like the pipes of a great cathedral organ, and water streams down its lichen-streaked bark on to the forest floor from bulbous knots in the wood.\n\n“It was like a waterfall of green, a great presence before me,” remembers the climate scientist Jonathan Barichivich, 41, of the first time he encountered the Gran Abuelo, or “great-grandfather”, tree as a child.\n\nBarichivich grew up in Alerce Costero national park, 500 miles (800km) south of the capital, Santiago. It is home to hundreds of alerces, Fitzroya cupressoides, slow-growing conifers native to the cold, wet valleys of the southern Andes.\n\n“I never thought about how old the Gran Abuelo could be,” he said. “Records don’t really interest me.” However, Barichivich’s groundbreaking study has shown the 100ft (30-metre) giant could be the world’s oldest living tree.\n\nIn January 2020, he visited the Gran Abuelo with his mentor and friend, the dendrochronologist Antonio Lara, to take a core sample from the trunk.\n\nThey were able to reach only 40% into the tree as its centre is likely to be rotten, making a complete core unattainable. Yet that sample yielded a finding of about 2,400 years.\n\nUndeterred, Barichivich set about devising a model that could estimate the Gran Abuelo’s age. Taking the known ages of other alerces in the forest and factoring in climate and natural variation, he calibrated a model that simulated a range of possible ages, producing an astounding estimate of 5,484 years old.\n\nThat would make it more than six centuries senior to Methuselah, a bristlecone pine in eastern California recognised as the world’s oldest non-clonal tree – a plant that does not share a common root system. Some clonal trees live longer, such as Sweden’s Old Tjikko, a Norway spruce thought to be 9,558 years old.\n\nBarichivich takes a core sample from a tree stump. Photograph: Salomón Henríquez\n\nBarichivich believes there is an 80% chance the tree has lived for more than 5,000 years – but some colleagues have poured scorn on the findings. They assert that complete, countable tree ring cores are the only true way of determining age.\n\nThe climate scientist hopes to publish his research early next year. He will continue to refine his model but waves away the “colonialism” present in the field.\n\nThe Gran Abuelo isn’t just old, it’s a time capsule with a message about the future Jonathan Barichivich\n\n“Some colleagues are sceptical and cannot understand why we have revealed the finding before formally publishing it,” he said. “But this is post-normal science. We have very little time to act – we cannot wait one or two years, it could already be too late.”\n\nBarichivich believes ancient trees may help experts understand how forests interact with the climate.\n\n“The Gran Abuelo isn’t just old, it’s a time capsule with a message about the future,” he said. “We have a 5,000-year record of life in this tree alone, and we can see the response of an ancient being to the changes we have made to the planet.”\n\nIn January, Barichivich, who works at the Laboratory for Climate and Environment Sciences and Environment in Paris, won a €1.5m European Research Council starting grant he describes as the “holy grail” for a scientist.\n\n\n\nHe has embarked on a five-year project to assess the future capacity of forests to capture carbon, hoping to add tree-ring data from thousands of sites around the world into climate simulations for the first time.\n\n\n\nMore than a third of the planet’s vegetated surface is covered by forests, capturing carbon dioxide during photosynthesis, but current models are only able to make estimates for 20 or 30 years into the future.\n\n\n\nBy adding data for xylogenesis, the formation of wood, Barichivich believes he could provide 100-year predictions for climate change – and revolutionise our ability to understand and mitigate its effects.\n\n“If tree rings are a book, then for 40 years everyone’s just been looking at the cover,” he said.\n\n‘Bit by bit, the tree is dying’\n\nBarichivich poses with Gran Abuelo. The climate scientist has embarked on a five-year project to assess the future capacity of forests to capture carbon. Photograph: Salomón Henríquez/the Guardian\n\nIn an office surrounded by varnished samples, fragile cores and wood shavings, Barichivich’s mentor Antonio Lara, 66, has spent his career working to reconstruct temperature, precipitation and watershed levels throughout history.\n\n\n\nLara, a professor at the Faculty of Forest Sciences and Natural Resources at Chile’s Austral University in the southern city of Valdivia, has been able to prove that alerces can absorb carbon from the atmosphere and trap it for between 1,500 and 2,000 years in standing dead trees. Buried alerce trunks can hold carbon for more than 4,000 years.\n\nHe has also pinpointed exact climatic events by translating tree rings into numbers, which can then be read like a barcode. “The great-grandfather tree is a miracle for three reasons – that it grew, that it survived, and then that it was found by Jonathan’s grandfather,” Lara said.\n\n\n\nIn the mid-1940s, Barichivich’s grandfather, Aníbal Henríquez, arrived from the southern city of Lautaro to work for the forestry companies felling the lahuan, as the alerces are known in the Indigenous language Mapudungun, his native tongue.\n\nHe went on to become the park’s first warden, but many giant alerce trees had already fallen victim to loggers before Chile made it illegal to cut them down in 1976.\n\nAlerce shingle was used as currency by local populations throughout the 1700s and 1800s and the wood was commonly used in construction. The famous Unesco-protected wooden churches on the island of Chiloé are built from alerce trunks.\n\n\n\nHenríquez happened upon Gran Abuelo while out on a patrol in the early 1970s. Although he was reluctant to disclose the find at first, word soon got out and people began to arrive: now, more than 10,000 tourists trek down to the small wooden viewing platform next to the tree each summer.\n\nAlerce shingle was used as currency by local populations throughout the 1700s and 1800s. Photograph: Krystyna Szulecka Photography/Alamy\n\nOther alerces in the valley fell victim to loggers or forest fires, leaving the gnarled tree standing alone. “Bit by bit, the tree is dying,” said Marcelo Delgado, Barichivich’s cousin who works in the park as one of five full-time rangers. “People jump down from the platform to peel off bark to take as a souvenir.”\n\n\n\nFootfall around the base of the tree has also damaged the thin layer of bark on its roots, affecting nutrient uptake. After 29 other trees were vandalised by tourists, Chile’s national forestry corporation, which manages the country’s national parks, closed the trail indefinitely.\n\n\n\nBarichivich hopes that by showing that Gran Abuelo is the world’s oldest tree, he could raise the alarm about the urgency with which we must protect the natural world. While the scope of his research is far broader, Barichivich insists the national park in which he grew up is where he belongs.\n\n\n\nWhen he was eight years old, his grandfather disappeared on a routine patrol out in the snow. His body was found two days later. Another uncle, also a park ranger, later died in the park.\n\n\n\n“It seems like it’s a family tradition,” Barichivich said. “The same fate probably awaits me, dying with my boots on out in the forest. But first I want to unlock its secrets.”",

    "‘My Imaginary Country’ Review: Chile in Revolt": "The most powerful images in “My Imaginary Country” are of the demonstrations in the streets of Santiago, Chile, that began in October 2019. Hundreds of thousands of Chileans took to the streets, at first to protest a subway fare increase, and eventually to demand sweeping changes to the nation’s economic and political order. They were met with tear gas, baton charges and plastic bullets aimed at their eyes. Some fought back with cobblestones chiseled from the street, which they hurled at the police.\n\nTo watch scenes like that in a documentary film — or, for that matter, on social media — is to experience a strong sense of déjà vu. What happened in Santiago in 2019 and 2020 feels like an echo of similar uprisings around the world; in Tehran in 2009 (and again this week); in Arab capitals like Tunis, Damascus and Cairo in 2011; in Kyiv in 2014; in Paris at the height of the Yellow Vest movement in 2018. Those episodes aren’t identical, but each represents the eruption of long-simmering dissatisfaction with a status quo that seems stubbornly indifferent to the grievances of the people.\n\nAccompanying the exhilaration that these pictures might bring is a sense of foreboding. In almost every case, these rebellions ended in defeat, disappointment, stalemate or worse. The buoyant democratic promise of Tahrir Square in Cairo has been smothered by a decade of military dictatorship. Ukrainian democracy, seemingly victorious after the Maidan “revolution of dignity,” has since faced internal and external threats, most recently from Vladimir Putin’s army.",
    "Chile: Rejection of New Constitution — Paradox of Democracy? Or, Wait and Watch?": "62% of voters in Chile rejected the proposed constitution last Sunday. It may seem paradoxical. How could they reject a constitution that would guarantee\n\n50% reservation for women;\n\nEducation, Health and Social Security and care for all are state responsibility; and also\n\nRights of Indigenous communities or nations or tribes (by whatever name they be called) would be documented for the first time in Chilean history declaring the country as Plurinational and Multi-cultural (rights of indigenous people of 11 nations e.g., Mapuche, Aymara, Quechua and etc and if some other tribe wants to declare its right as a nation it would also be included);\n\nWater will be declared as a Human Right and no personal property will be allowed;\n\nNatures’ Rights would be recognised and Climate Change would be declared as an immediate concern and so on so forth\n\nIn recent past, Chile voted 78% for a new constitution in October 2020. Chile also elected a 35-years-old ‘leftist’ once ‘student-leader’ as President in December 2021.\n\nTens and hundreds of thousands of Chileans burst out in mass-protest starting from October 18, 2019 that continued in some form or other till the Covid restrictions came. Fare-rise in mass transport system, price rise of all essential commodities, intolerably high inequality – all these led masses of people to burst in anger. Government was compelled to propose some changes. More than half citizens came to vote in Oct-2020 referendum and 78% demanded a new constitution. Then came election for constituent assembly that would wite constitution. Next, in end 2021 presidential election made a change in government. This year the proposed new constitution was printed and was made available for the public to read and reflect.\n\nThe new constitution talked of some good measures; some of which are mentioned above. Besides, there are — *mother’s right of having baby (or not), which de facto means abortion would be legalised; *instead of ‘democratic republic’ (República Democrática) Chile would be called a parity centred democracy (Democracia Paritaria).\n\nPeople did burst out spontaneously. Political forces also steppe in. People in the streets started saying ‘NO’ to many aspects of this society – from which in some way a People’s Charter can also be prepared. The Gilet Jaunes in France could formulate a 42-points Charter of Demands in 2019 by participation of hundreds of thousands via social networks and also actual meetings. More than a century ago the Working Women’s Day rally starting from factories in Russian capital started a movement for #peace, #bread and #8-hours-day, and the movement within few days demolished centuries old Monarchy in Russia and de-facto brought democracy. In places the political organisations can also formulate charter of demands taking clue from the people.\n\nIn Chile the composition of the elected constituent assembly shows the social dilemma that was going on, as much as those are (at all or partially) reflected in votes. Out of 155 seats, 17 were reserved to be elected by and from the Indigenous people. Among the rest, 138, the right-wing grouping Vamos por Chile got 20.56% of votes to get 37 seats, whereas the so-called left-wing grouping Apruebo Dignidad got 18.74% votes and acquired 28 seats. Three various “independent” groupings, if counted together, got almost 39% votes and got 62 seats. If we try to understand why Chilean voters behaved like this, some information in this regard might be interesting: Analysing the results obtained from an opinion poll “Criteria” (can be had at https://www.criteria.cl/descargas/Agenda_Criteria_Julio_2022-7b5hR.pdf) Noam Titelman writes ‘82% of the people wanted that the writers of the new constitution should not be of any political party’ such was their disdain or lack-of-faith regarding existing political parties there, whereas, ‘in contrast demand for ordinary people are to be member of constituent assembly fell from 37% (Oct 2020) to 20% (in July 2022), but support for ‘experts’ rose from 63% to 80%’.\n\n(¿Adónde fue a parar el apoyo al proceso constituyente chileno? Noam Titelman https://nuso.org/articulo/Chile-plebiscito-constitucion/)\n\nBut other things also changed and have been changing.\n\n(1) Covid restrictions brought a phase of people-NOT-in-streets. It also immensely increased the hardship of live for commoners. There were some governmental help programmes like AFP (help from pension fund, roughly from June 2020 to April 2021), then IFE (Ingreso Familiar de Emergencia, emergency relief, from April 2021 to December 2021) — according to that CRITERIA survey, except this period more than a third of the Chileans were feeling their personal economic situation was deteriorating. Except for the emergency relief period, more than half of Chileans were unsatisfied and worried about the way country was going.\n\n(2) The way the constituent assembly and parties were working were seen differently by different section of the people. A survey in which the famous IPSOS also participated, “¿Cómo vemos el proceso constituyente?” (available at https://espaciopublico.cl/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Informe-sexta-entrega-Resultados-Encuesta-y-Focus-Group.pdf) done in July 2022, some very important aspects can be seen:\n\nAs to ‘how much informed you are regarding the working of the constituent assembly’ (¿Qué tan informado/a se siente usted respecto del trabajo que realizó la Convención Constitucional?) the porer the economic group the less they were informed, as they felt.Among the lowest economic strata (D and E) only 26% thought they knew what was going on.\n\nNot only that, the Director of CONADI (National Corporation for Development of Indigenous Population) told that the Mapuche Population did not realise what was written in the text of the constitution! (https://www.theclinic.cl/2022/09/05/director-conadi-declaraciones-triunfo-rechazo/)\n\n(3) In the same survey it was noted that there were some domains regarding which there were confusions in public mind. Surprisingly, Health, Education and Pension – all were within this ‘confusing’ category! According to Macarena Segovia and Paulina Toro (in “Los cuatro días clave que llevaron al Rechazo al tope de las encuestas y los cinco meses de campaña para mantener esa ventaja” 05.09.2022 https://www.ciperchile.cl/2022/09/05/los-cuatro-dias-clave-que-llevaron-al-rechazo-al-tope-de-las-encuestas-y-los-cinco-meses-de-campana-para-mantener-esa-ventaja/) the right-wing exploited some blanks and some indecisions regarding pension funds and other social security measures, and turned the table. According to them $116.7 millions were spent in Facebook campaign to malign the proposed constitution and to increase confusions. In another article of Cipher Chile (https://www.ciperchile.cl/2022/08/26/las-cinco-organizaciones-fantasmas-que-pagan-los-avisos-del-rechazo-en-las-radios-mas-populares/), we find some ‘ghost organisations’ that spend $144 millions in FM Radio advertisements to conduct a tirade against the proposed constitution. These all trued to show how badly the country and the people would fare if the proposed constitution come into effect.\n\n(4) Claudia Heiss, Head of Ciencia Política, Universidad de Chile and Javier Couso, Professor and Constitution specialist at Universidad de Utrecht praised the Pension, Health and (social) Care measures proposed in the constitution. Professor Couso said that the proposed system may take Chilean health system to be like the NHS of UK (https://www.eluniverso.com/noticias/internacional/seis-grandes-cambios-que-marca-la-nueva-constitucion-propuesta-para-chile-nota/). But the right-wingers could create such confusions so as to distract many citizens.\n\nThe proposed constitution did mention such rights. But still there were haziness and that was due to the fact that how all these would be done, how the cost will be borne and etc. After the constitution articles there comes some pages describing “Transitory Dispositions” and in the twenty-seventh clause we find that the President will place bills regarding “Social Security System and Care System, within a period of twelve months; National Health System, within eighteen months; and the National Education System, the Public Education System and the Integrated Public Land System, in twenty-four months” after the constitution comes into effect. \\\n\n(5) In the capitalist sectors some anxieties were already there: for example, according to some estimation the cost of such social ventures may be in between 8.0% and 14.5% of the GDP, 25-40 million dollars (https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/internacionales/11-claves-para-entender-el-plebiscito-para-la-nueva-Constitucion-de-Chile-20220902-0075.html). Private sectors in mining were also not happy. These may explain the right-wing’s vehement campaign for the NO in the referendum.\n\nBut what next?\n\nNicolás Tobar Jorquera wrote in Ciper yesterday, September 6: “In these first days it must be emphasized that nobody has won anything yet. The results of September 4 do not favour anything more than anomie, and it is very difficult to build a stable house out of the mud. (¿Quién ganó con el Rechazo? https://www.ciperchile.cl/2022/09/06/quien-gano-con-el-rechazo/) Seen from some other way too will give the same impression – Chile did not celebrate after the referendum besides so,e scattered jubilations of staunch NO-sayers in some neighbourhoods of the capital.\n\nThe President, the government, the constituent assembly may shuffle and reshuffle, do changes. Already it was seen how the right-wing media interfered (and won) in the recent-most cabinet reshuffle, dropping a probable deputy minister of interior, a ‘communist’, for his anti-militarist tweet of 2011! But ultimately things will depend on the masses of the toilers who started the process of change in October 2019. Their actions were halted due to Covid restrictions and accompanying financial difficulties, and of course there were constitutional illusions everywhere and Chile is no exception. But dissatisfaction is increasing as at least the July-August opinion polls saw. It is too early to predict.\n\nSandeep Banerjee is a researcher from Kolkotta",

    "Misinformation abounds as Chile prepares to vote on new constitution": "Chile is heading towards a historic plebiscite on a new constitution to replace the document drawn up during Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship, but the vote will take place amid a climate of uncertainty driven by a storm of falsehoods and divisive campaigns.\n\nFor weeks, television advertising spots, street canvassers and social media campaigns have attempted to sway opinion towards the two options which will appear on the ballot this Sunday: “approve” or “reject”.\n\n“We’re inundated with a tsunami of information,” said former advertising executive Eugenio García, 69, “Nowadays, it’s hard to tell what’s true, false, biased or malicious.”\n\nGarcía helped craft the campaign calling on Chileans to say no to eight more years of Pinochet’s rule in a previous plebiscite in the spring of 1988. They did so by a narrow margin.\n\n“There are similarities between then and now in that they want to change the moral fabric of the country,” said García, “But what is at stake this time is actually far greater – it is part of a global change.”\n\nOver 12 months, a democratically elected gender-equal convention, representing a vast range of agendas and political stances, worked to draft the new constitution.\n\nThe result of the process, presented in July, is a remarkably progressive document enshrining gender equality and Indigenous rights, expanding social protections and guaranteeing environmental protection.\n\nHowever, criticism has been levelled at its shake-up of the political system, which detractors argue was not the cause of the country’s discontent. Others have labelled the proposed constitution a “wishlist” of rights that will be hard to put into practice.\n\nPolling has consistently suggested that Chileans will reject the proposal in the referendum, in which everybody aged 18 or over must vote.\n\nBut if the constitution is approved, it will replace the 1980 document which, despite significant reforms, retains the ideological fingerprints of the Pinochet dictatorship under which it was drafted without democratic input.\n\nMapuche Indigenous people hold flags of approval of the new constitution in Temuco, Chile, this month. Photograph: Mario Quilodran/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAn insidious trend of misinformation has weighed heavily on the process since October 2020, when Chileans voted overwhelmingly in favour of drafting a new constitution.\n\n“With the first plebiscite there was a boom of misinformation,” said Valentina Matus, the editor of Contexto Factual.\n\n“Even though there wasn’t anything written yet, they were already saying that you could have your house taken away,” remembered Matus.\n\nDuring a televised campaign in 2021, a rightwing party falsely claimed that the new constitution would change Chile’s national anthem, flag – and even the name of the country.\n\nOnline, the daily swirl of false announcements and misleading interpretations of the text have made fact-checking difficult.\n\n“There are constant examples of statements that I don’t consider outright lies, but rather exaggerations,” said Eduardo Arriagada, an adjunct professor at the Pontifical Catholic University’s communications faculty in Santiago.\n\n“Constitutions don’t usually give details, they give broad definitions and allow for a range of scenarios for the law to sort out later, but that leaves them open to interpretation.”\n\nPredictably, the most emotive topics have been foregrounded.\n\nIn May, Senator Felipe Kast claimed that under the new constitution, abortion would be permitted up to the ninth month of a pregnancy. The text enshrines reproductive rights, but explicitly leaves the details up to the law.\n\nAnother recurring falsehood has been that private property could be confiscated under the new constitution.\n\nAmong the more outlandish claims, a website whose design mimicked that of the constitutional convention claimed that deprivatising the country’s water rights would outlaw the sale of bottled water and bags of ice for summer barbecues.\n\nIn response to a wave of false social media posts, one congressman even presented a bill in late July that would sanction sharing fake news about the constitution with a fine of around 33m pesos (£31,000).\n\n“From day one, the campaign against the new constitution manipulated what I said and sowed lies,” said Elisa Loncón, who represented the Indigenous Mapuche people in the convention and was elected its first president.\n\n“What they want is to silence and minimise us. All of the Mapuche women in the convention were subject to these attacks.”\n\nPeople demonstrate against the draft of the new constitution in Santiago at the weekend. Photograph: Martin Bernetti/AFP/Getty Images\n\nConfidence in the process was also rocked by scandal when a delegate was dishonourably excluded from the convention in September last year.\n\nA newspaper investigation revealed that Rodrigo Rojas Vade had falsely claimed to suffer from a rare form of leukaemia – the premise for his election as a campaigner for serious illnesses – and eventually resigned his seat.\n\nMore recently, activists on the fringe right have copied the tactics of the far-right leaders Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro, attacking Chile’s electoral service and hinting that they may not accept the result of the referendum.\n\nDespite the campaign, few seriously doubt the integrity of Chile’s electoral process. In its 2022 country report on Chile, the Freedom House NGO gave Chilean democracy a rating of 94 out of 100 – the second highest in Latin America – concluding that “Chile’s electoral framework is robust and generally well implemented”.\n\nBut efforts to allow Chileans to make an informed choice on Sunday have often met with resistance.\n\n“With misinformation getting there first, it’s hard to make sure the truth or fact-checking has the same reach,” said Matus.\n\n“Lies about emotional subjects will always outrun efforts to debunk them.”",
    "‘Only Way Out Is Emancipation’: Mapuche Ponder Future As Chile Rejects Constitution": "The Latin American Left is regrouping. On July 19, 2021, Peru’s National Elections Jury announced the official results of the 2021 presidential elections, declaring Pedro Castillo as President of Peru. An important voting survey in Brazil has revealed that Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva would outperform neo-fascist President Jair Bolsonaro in all scenarios for the 2022 elections in the country. Colombia is in socio-economic turmoil, creating a potential opening for the election of Gustavo Petro – a left-wing politician. In Chile, the result of elections held on May 15-16, 2021, for the 155-member new constituent assembly has thrust progressive candidates to the forefront of national politics. All these dynamics will regionally strengthen the leftist governments already in power in Argentina, Bolivia, Cuba, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. An anti-neoliberal shift in Latin America’s political compass carries global significance.\n\nImperialism\n\n\n\nLarge swathes of humanity who live in the peripheries of the world system have been witnessing a deadly process of absolute immiseration. Imperialism has restricted the economic growth of the periphery to mineral and agricultural sectors in order to assure raw materials for advanced capitalist nations. Hence, most Third World economies are heavily dependent on the export of primary commodities. In Latin America, such primary commodities account for the majority of exports for nearly all countries. While Latin American countries export primary goods to the Global North, they tend to re-import manufactured products from these same countries. The value added to these manufactured commodities – typically constructed from the primary inputs imported earlier – generates profit for northern countries while maintaining Latin American countries in a perpetual trade deficit.\n\nWhile some countries in the periphery have facilitated a degree of industrialization through the surpluses accumulated from export-led growth, the disarticulated structures of these economies persists. The imperialist states’ monopolies – technological, financial, natural resources, communications, and military – has meant that there has been a lack of any significant indigenous technical development. Even to the extent that industrial growth has occurred, it has been based on the import of capital and technology, which has considerably reduced the dynamic effects on the economy that are usually associated with industrial growth. Moreover, a relocation of the locus of value creation from the core to the periphery means that the core relies less and less on the unprofitable exploitation of its own workers. Instead, the metropole increasingly divides the world into what has been labeled as Southern “production economies” and Northern “consumption economies.”\n\nThe main driver behind this process is undoubtedly the low wage level in the South. Entrenchment of extroverted economies like these has generated cut-throat competition amongst Southern firms for foreign capital. What we have now is a global race to the bottom, marked by a deathly spiral of exchange rate devaluations, hyper-low taxes and depressed wages. Multinational corporations based in the capitalist core have unendingly feasted on this wretchedness, fattening their profits from the extreme exploitation of the Third World’s large labor reserves. As such, the structure of today’s global economy has been profoundly shaped by the allocation of labor to industrial sectors according to differential rates of national exploitation. Thus, only the outward form of value transfers from the South to the North has changed, with the unequal exchange of products embodying different quantities of value steadily continuing. A large pool of precarized workers has been created, which consistently remains enmeshed in networks of informal economy, being forced by the productive configurations to enrich foreign capitalists and nourish the parasitic nature of the comprador bourgeoisie.\n\nInternational Finance Capital\n\n\n\nThe continuation of the international division of labor and the creation of dependent industrialization has been complemented by the hegemony of international finance capital. Prabhat Patnaik writes:\n\n“In the current phase of imperialism, finance capital has become international, while the State remains a nation-State. The nation-State therefore willy-nilly must bow before the wishes of finance, for otherwise finance (both originating in that country and brought in from outside) will leave that particular country and move elsewhere, reducing it to illiquidity and disrupting its economy. The process of globalization of finance therefore has the effect of undermining the autonomy of the nation-State. The State cannot do what it wishes to do, or what its elected government has been elected to do, since it must do what finance wishes it to do.”\n\nThe interests of the financial oligarchy lie in strongly opposing state expenditure financed either by taxes on capitalists or by borrowing – the only ways of financing through which the state can effect a net expansion in aggregate demand. Financial interests are against deficit-financed spending for a number of reasons. First, deficit financing is seen to increase the liquidity overhang in the system, and therefore as being potentially inflationary. Inflation is anathema to finance since it erodes the value of financial assets. Second, financial markets fear that the introduction of debt-financed spending – which is driven by goals other than profit-making – will render interest rate differentials that determine financial profits more unpredictable. Third, if deficit spending leads to a substantial build-up of the state’s debt, it may intervene in financial markets to lower interest rates with implications for financial returns.\n\nUnder these circumstances, even moderate welfarism has become a danger to the neoliberal order. Whereas the welfare state in the immediate post-War era served the ruling class by warding off the threat of communism, in the neoliberal era – where accumulation by dispossession has become the predominant mode of capitalist growth – even the most modest of demand management policies have had to face intense political opposition. Taking into account the internationally polarizing and nationally suffocating results of global capitalism, the slow resurgence of the Latin American Left will provide an avenue for the advancement of an alternative agenda.\n\nThe Experience of the Pink Tide\n\nFirstly, progressive governments in the continent have always tried to tackle relations of dependency, as is discernible from their experience in power during the Pink Tide. In opposition to metropolitan control over mineral resources and plantations, the Latin American Left consolidated the public sector which displaced the dominance of foreign capital. These arrangements ensured that the revenues coming from the primary commodity sector were no longer siphoned off by the rich but were diverted towards the poor. The assertion of control over financial resources and their redirection toward social developmentalism was coupled with the uneven promotion of sovereign forms of industrialization, trade and finance through various initiatives like the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, the Union of South American Nations and the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of our America.\n\nBefore the public sector and regional groupings could be fully used for developing domestic heavy-industry base and technological capability, the commodity boom itself collapsed. This external event did not allow the Left’s redistributive strategy to transform into concerted attempts at changing the productive forces. However, the fact that a politico-ideological project of independence was advocated stands as a testimony to the fruitful possibilities contained in the Pink Tide. Industrialization, social welfare, and the nation came together in the notion of sovereignty; industrialization was not posed simply as a means by which Third World capitalists could accumulate capital more effectively, but as a means of improving the nation as a whole.\n\nMoreover, a programme of selective delinking was supported which allowed Latin American governments to self-determine which sector of the economy could be safely opened up. They could differentially open up a sector where foreign capital was needed to supplement local capital in whole or in part. As part of this blueprint of economic self-determination, clear-headed campaigns were initiated to resist pressures to liberalize the financial sector. In fact, Latin America’s leftist governments tended to increase the level of capital controls instead of merely adapting to the constraints imposed by financial globalization. The reregulation of cross-border financial flows was part of a coordinated effort to obtain further macroeconomic policy autonomy and attend to the interests of impoverished constituencies.\n\nThe existence of capital controls enabled the Latin American Left to temporarily soften the impact of the end of commodity boom. One of the visible ways that the collapse of primary commodity prices makes itself felt is through a shortage of foreign exchange to finance necessary imports. This gives rise to inflation, to currency depreciations which further aggravate inflation, and to shortages of essential goods. Further, the reduced incomes -a result of the slump in the primary commodity demand – cause recession, stagnation and unemployment. The conservation of foreign exchange for importing essential commodities, and the prevention of outflow of foreign exchange by wealth-holders hedging against exchange rate depreciation, become extremely important. Towards this end, the Latin American Left’s regulatory management of banks and foreign trade proved to be crucial in mitigating the effects of changing global conditions.\n\nSecondly, Latin American leftist governments extensively used planning and welfare policies, such as conditional cash transfers (CCTs), financed through the receipts of economic growth and the taxation of rising commodity exports. Under a new socio-economic structure of accumulation, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rates increased and social conditions improved, reversing the adverse consequences of neoliberalism and cementing popular support for the Pink Tide administrations. The GDP per capita of Latin America and the Caribbean rose by 31% between 2003 and 2013, poverty rates fell from 32 to 17%, and the country-average of the Gini index of household per capita income in Latin America fell by 0.06. All this stood in complete contrast to the past implementations of harsh austerity programs and fiscal niggardliness which were intended to restore government’s “credibility” and return to the elusive cycle of growth led solely by private investment.\n\nThe implementation of welfare policies needs to be looked in the specific context of contemporary capitalism. In a global situation marked by the hegemony of international finance capital and calcified hierarchies, the unleashing of successful poverty alleviation schemes, increase in minimum wages, strengthening of labor regulations and the weakening of deficit targets were not acceptable to the elites who saw these policies as a precursor to more radical shifts. Thus, in an era of finance capital where even the most basic welfare spending runs contrary to the interests of an inflation-fearing financial oligarchy, the Latin American Left’s fiscal expansionism and consolidation of social policies constituted a sharp attack on neoliberal interests.\n\nPresent-day fluctuations in the balance of forces in Latin America hint towards a revival of the Left. We need to comprehend these fluid tectonic plates of popular power from an actively political perspective. Building a socialist society in a Third World country, in which – despite its wealth of natural resources – there remains immense poverty and hideous inequality is a hard task. Moving against the powerful tide of reactionary forces and helping the oppressed classes to overcome social humiliation requires a long gestation period. In short, the entrance of the Global South subaltern on the stage of history is a richly textured pathway of socialized autonomy which never follows a linear or perfect course of economic reconstruction. Most of the times, the width of populist culture and depth of working class power intersect to generate a multi-sided trajectory of revolution. As Vladimir Lenin himself said, “Whoever expects a “pure” social revolution will never live to see it. Such a person pays lip-service to revolution without understanding what revolution is.” Thus, in the current conjuncture, we need to show solidarity with Latin America’s renascent Pink Tide which promises to deal a blow to imperialist capitalism.\n\nThis article first appeared in the Orinoco Tribune.",
    "In Chile's desert lie vast reserves of lithium — key for electric car batteries": "ATACAMA DESERT, Chile — In the middle of the desert in northern Chile, massive pools of Caribbean blue water sit next to what appear to be snowdrifts.\n\nBut this is a lithium mine.\n\nThe pools are filled with salty groundwater that contains lithium. It's a key component in the rechargeable lithium-ion batteries for electric cars, solar panels and other green technologies.\n\n\"It's really, really a beautiful place,\" says Marcelo Valdebenito, a public relations officer for Albemarle Corp., the Charlotte, N.C.-based chemical company that operates the mine. \"This is the lithium that powers the world.\"\n\nIndeed, the world is hungry for the silvery-white metal. The International Energy Agency is projecting a more than 40-fold increase in demand for lithium by 2040. Lithium prices have hit record highs this year.\n\nDespite growing concerns about the environmental impact of lithium extraction, skyrocketing demand is good news for mining companies in Chile. The South American country is the second-largest lithium producer after Australia. And Argentina, Bolivia and Chile are known as the \"lithium triangle,\" together holding more than half of the world's proven lithium reserves.\n\nAnnual production at the Albemarle mine has increased from 22,000 tons to 84,000 tons since 2016, says Ignacio Mehech, the company's country manager in Chile.\n\n\"We are growing as the demand is growing and today we are a much bigger company,\" Mehech told NPR, adding that the company now has 1,000 employees in Chile, up from 250 five years ago.\n\nSouth America could power up\n\nEven so, the region's lithium output is just a fraction of what it could be, leading to fears of an eventual bottleneck in world supplies.\n\nBolivian President Luis Arce has pledged to make his country \"the world capital of lithium\" and supply 40% of global demand for the metal by 2030. But due to technological challenges and community resistance, as well as heavy state intervention in the economy, the industry has been slow to develop. Production in Bolivia remains negligible.\n\nEconomic turmoil has kept Argentina from opening more mines.\n\nMeanwhile, Chile has high taxes and strict mining regulations, says Mehech. The red tape for production permits involves securing approval from the nation's nuclear energy commission since the metal can be used in nuclear power and weapons.\n\n\"It is very difficult and that's why you don't see more lithium companies in Chile,\" Mehech says of Albemarle, which he says is one of just two companies producing lithium in Chile.\n\nMining raises environmental concerns\n\nBut some Chileans prefer a go-slow approach.\n\nThey include microbiologist Cristina Dorador, who has spent years studying the salt flats of the Atacama Desert. She says lithium mines extract huge amounts of groundwater. Ten-times saltier than seawater, this brine is then placed in enormous evaporation pools. After 18 months, the resulting 6% lithium solution is then turned into a white lithium powder and exported for use in batteries.\n\nDorador says removing so much groundwater will inevitably make the Atacama Desert — home to Chile's lithium mines — hotter and drier. She recently co-authored an investigation linking lithium mining to an 11% reduction in the local flamingo population over the past decade.\n\n\"With so much pressure from the world to produce more lithium,\" she says, \"the price is going to be paid by Chile's environment.\"\n\nWhy not make the batteries, too?\n\nAnother critic is Andrés Díaz, who directs the Center for Energy and Sustainable Development at Diego Portales University in Santiago, the Chilean capital. Instead of just lithium, he thinks Chile should produce and export higher-valued lithium-ion batteries that the country currently imports from Asia at a steep cost.\n\nTo move in that direction, Albemarle signed an agreement with the Chilean government to spend $300 million on research and development here by 2043.\n\n\"For us, it doesn't make any sense to export lithium and then buy from other countries batteries with a material that we produced at the very beginning,\" Díaz says.\n\nMehech acknowledges that lithium mining uses a lot of groundwater but claims the tradeoff is worth it. He points out that the amount of water required to produce enough lithium for an electric car battery is about the same amount needed to produce a half pound of beef or 11 avocados.\n\nThe avocados, he says, will last for just a few days, \"but a lithium battery lasts for 10 years and then you can recycle it.\"\n\nCopyright 2022 NPR.

    "Blog: Chile's Boric wasted an opportunity for Palestine at the UN General Assembly": "Chilean President Gabriel Boric may currently be the most outspoken leader in Latin America on Palestinian rights and Israeli violations. However, his rhetoric leaves much to be desired. It, in turn, raises questions about how Chile – the country with the largest Palestinian community in the region – can differentiate itself from other countries to become a model to follow, rather than following international consensus over the two-state compromise and Israel's security narrative.\n\nIn his first address to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), Boric spoke about Palestine's right to freedom and sovereignty while mangling his message by including a false equivalence with Israel that eliminates the colonial context. \"[Palestinian people] should yield to their inalienable right to establish their own free and sovereign state. In the same way, [let's] guarantee Israel's legitimate right to live within secure and internationally recognised borders,\" Boric asserted.\n\nBoric's speech was pronounced \"politically correct\", while noting that Chile's stance has always advocated for the recognition of Palestinian people's rights and Israel's rights while promoting the two-state compromise, like the rest of the international community. In which case, Boric's activist stances as president are unlikely to leave any impact on Chilean diplomacy. Under Boric, the Chilean government is advocating for the same stance that his predecessor Sebastian Pinera adhered to, which is a bonus for Israel, despite the grievances Israeli media aired upon Boric's electoral victory.\n\nREAD: The EU should stop exploiting Palestinian NGOs\n\nDays before his UNGA speech, Boric postponed accepting the credentials of the new Israeli ambassador to Chile, Gil Artzyeli, in response to the Israeli forces' killing of 17-year-old Palestinian Odai Trad Salah in Kufr Dan near Jenin. However, his stance, which made headline news in major media outlets worldwide, was diminished by the UNGA speech that attempted equivalence between the coloniser and the colonised while simplifying, to the point of obliteration, the reason why Palestinians are deprived of a state, possibly permanently.\n\nBoric is not unaware of the Palestinian plight as a result of Zionist colonisation. Neither is he oblivious to the fact that Palestinians and the indigenous people of Chile – the Mapuche – have suffered similar forms of aggression because of governments criminalising their struggle for land reclamation and political autonomy. Yet, it is possible that, as president, Boric's activist stances will be mellowed by diplomatic requirements, such as abiding by the two-state compromise, which has failed Palestinians and become defunct in all but international rhetoric.\n\nPrior to the presidency, Boric stood out as one of the most vocal activists in Chile. As president, Boric is navigating a complex reality that includes the legacy of Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship and ties to Israel during that period, as well as the country's reliance on securing military and surveillance equipment from Palestine's oppressors.\n\nTo cast Israel and legitimacy together is an aberration, particularly when using such descriptions to balance advocating for Palestinian rights. Boric wasted an opportunity at his first UNGA speech to call out Israel's colonial violence and how it invalidates legitimacy. It is not up to the international community to guarantee Israel's existence, but Boric knows that Chile can play a pivotal role in ensuring that the international community gravitates towards the legitimacy of the Palestinian people's political demands.\n\nREAD: Chile President refuses Israeli ambassador's credentials over Israel's killing of Palestinians\n\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Monitor.",

    "Chile’s progressive new constitution rejected by voters after campaign marred by misinformation": "Despite recently electing Chile’s most progressive president in the shape of former student protest leader Gabriel Boric, voters in the country have now rejected his most important reform. A plebiscite held on September 4 to replace the constitution imposed during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet with a progressive new one led to a solid no vote. This has effectively halted Boric’s agenda for reform.\n\nThe final ballot stood at 62% rejecting (Rechazo) the proposed document and just 38% approving (Apruebo). It was a result that directly contradicted the initial plebiscite held in 2020 when 78% of voters backed the idea of a new constitution, after which Eliza Loncon, an indigenous left-wing academic was elected to oversee a constitutional convention to write the document.\n\nRead more: Chile: election of progressive indigenous academic to oversee constitutional reform is a blow to right-wing establishment\n\nThe decision to rewrite the constitution came after months of political upheaval in 2019-20 caused by a crisis of inequality. Protests over metro fares in the capital, Santiago, developed into a mass social movement encompassing feminists, environmentalists, indigenous groups and anti-neoliberal activists calling for progressive socioeconomic change.\n\nThe new document was certainly radical, with a range of political and social reforms guaranteeing a range of social rights including housing, social security, health, work and access to food. There was also a range of proposed environmental reforms making fighting climate change a state duty and requiring the state to protect biodiversity, native species and natural spaces.\n\nPolitical reforms included an element of direct democracy, gender parity, indigenous rights and a restructuring of the bicameral parliamentary system to give the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house) more power at the expense of the Senate.\n\nConceding defeat, Boric said: “I’m sure all this effort won’t have been in vain, because this is how countries advance best, learning from experience and, when necessary, turning back on their tracks to find a new route forward.”\n\nThe “no” vote has not only halted the implementation of a new constitution, it has also forced a cabinet reshuffle. Boric has removed some of his more progressive ministers, including former interior minister Izkia Siches, a doctor of indigenous descent who helped shape Chile’s pandemic response.\n\nIn place he has brought in figures from Chile’s traditional political class such as Carolina Toha, a minister in former president Michelle Bachelet’s first administration. This hints at a shift toward centrist politics.\n\nAs such, the newly elected president seems increasingly fragile and politically isolated, with a much-reduced mandate.\n\nMany commentators have been baffled by the referendum result, wondering how citizens that had galvanised across the nation for political change, have settled for a constitution enacted by one of Latin America’s most brutal dictators.\n\nFearmongering and misinformation\n\nFake news became a defining feature of the “rechazo” campaign which, in turn, the mainstream Chilean media was more than happy to amplify for clicks and views. One such story, propagated by far-right politician Felipe Kast who Boric defeated in the 2021 election, claimed that abortions would be legalised for up to nine months into pregnancy.\n\nKast also claimed, before retracting the story, that Venezuelan president Nicola Maduro had supported the draft constitution. Kast circulated on his Twitter feed a video purporting to back this claim. He subsequently withdrew the claim and apologised.\n\nOther “half-truths” circulating on TikTok, Instagram and Twitter were that private property would be expropriated, insurance funds could not be inherited, and that uniformed police would be abolished. An early 2022 survey found that 58% of Chileans had been exposed to some form of misinformation.\n\nAnother line of attack focused on the people involved in writing the new constitution, who some critics argued were not representative of the whole of Chilean society but had a majority from the left. One critic, Kenneth Bunker, said the quota system to ensure that indigenous groups were properly represented on the drafting body, also didn’t represent the conservative side of Chilean politics.\n\nEPA-EFE/Alberto Valdes\n\nCiper, an investigative media outlet, found that most of those who voted against the new constitution did so because of false information.\n\nCiper surveyed 120 people across 12 districts of Santiago and found that the main reasons for rejecting the new constitution were people’s fear of having their property expropriated, scare campaigns about unrestricted abortions and the spectre of indigenous people having more rights than the rest of the nation. None of these are accurate reflections of the proposed reforms.\n\nIt’s a devastating blow for progressive politics in Chile. As the 50th anniversary of the military coup that ended the last progressive government in 1973 draws closer, it seems the country is no closer to shaking off Pinochet’s social and economic legacy.",

But disaster struck for Rosberg, when a software glitch meant RXR missed the deadline to make the grid for the climax – the first time in two seasons that the inaugural champion team hadn’t raced in the final.\n\nThat meant Chip Ganassi Racing made a surprise last-minute appearance as first reserve, joining Acciona Sainz and Abt Cupra – plus McLaren which had qualified by winning the so-called (and as it turned out suitably-named) ‘Crazy Race’.",
    "Chile rejects its new constitution": "Chile rejects its new constitution\n\nChile has voted a resounding NO to a proposed constitution that would have put a focus on social issues and gender parity, enshrine rights for the indigenous population, and address climate change.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nIn Chile, a special assembly has spent the past two years writing a new constitution, and it was supposed to replace the current one that dates back to the country's military dictatorship. But yesterday, voters soundly rejected the new constitution in a referendum and then celebrated in the streets of Santiago.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF CAR HORNS HONKING, CHEERING)\n\nMARTIN: NPR's John Otis is just back from a reporting trip to Chile, and he joins us now. Good morning, John.\n\nJOHN OTIS, BYLINE: Good morning. It's good to be here.\n\nMARTIN: So people clearly excited. Tell us what this rejection means.\n\nOTIS: Well, the rejection means a huge blow for Chile's president, Gabriel Boric. He was a really big supporter of this new constitution. But nearly 62% of Chileans voted against it, compared to just 38% in favor. In fact, the outcome became so clear so quickly that the campaign for approval conceded defeat less than two hours after the polls closed.\n\nMARTIN: Wow. I mean, they clearly didn't have the right political temperature on how this was going to go over with voters. Why was it so controversial, this new constitution?\n\nOTIS: You know, some have called it the world's most progressive constitution. For example, it would have vastly expanded rights for Indigenous groups and created more protections for the environment. It would have made - it would have mandated universal health care, as well as the right to decent housing, education and pensions, and it calls for gender parity in government and legalized abortion. But Chile is actually quite a conservative place. Married couples couldn't even get divorced in Chile until 2004.\n\nSome of this new constitution might have hurt the economy because, for example, stricter environmental rules might have put the brakes on the copper and lithium mining industries. It would have meant higher taxes to pay for a lot of these new government benefits included in the constitution. There was also a disinformation campaign that spread lies about it. And finally, you know, the best constitutions are usually short and to the point, but this one was really long. It had 388 articles, and it was - just ended up being too much for voters to digest.\n\nMARTIN: Yeah. So if you could just step back for a moment, explain what was behind this movement to draft a new constitution in the first place?\n\nOTIS: Well, there were two reasons. First, anti-government protests back in 2019 nearly brought down Chile's government. To calm the waters and to address protesters' concerns about poverty and inequality, a special assembly began writing a new constitution. The other reason is that the current one was written back in 1980. That's when dictator Augusto Pinochet ruled Chile. Democracy was restored in 1990. And when most countries go through such momentous political changes, they write new rules of the game, new governing guidelines, but Chile never really got around to that until now.\n\nMARTIN: So, I mean, what happens? Is the effort to change the constitution dead at this point?\n\nOTIS: It's not dead. President Boric went on Chilean TV last night and claimed that the effort to forge a new constitution isn't over. Let's take a listen.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT GABRIEL BORIC: (Speaking Spanish).\n\nOTIS: So Boric is saying here that he plans to meet with Congress and civil society in the coming days to try to start this process all over again. This was expected because in spite of last night's rejection, polls show that Chileans don't like their Pinochet-era constitution either. But Boric has said whoever drafts the next version of the constitution, they're going to have to come up with something that unites Chileans rather than divides them, like this one did.\n\nMARTIN: John Otis reporting for NPR.

    "Proposed new rules regarding foreign tax credits in Chile": "Chile has a unilateral and a bilateral foreign tax mechanism.\n\nThe unilateral tax credit mechanism is applicable for countries that have not signed a double tax treaty with Chile. It applies only to certain kinds of foreign-sourced income and is limited to a maximum rate of 35%.\n\nThe bilateral tax credit mechanism applies to foreign-sourced income earned from a country with which Chile has a double tax treaty. It applies to all kinds of income included in the treaty and is also limited to a maximum rate of 35%.\n\nSince the corporate income tax rate is 27%, if the foreign tax credit exceeds this amount, the difference up to 35% can be used against final taxes (surtax in the case of Chilean individuals and additional withholding tax in the case of foreigners earning Chilean-sourced income).\n\nAlso, if a foreign investment is held through different layers abroad, Chilean tax law allows the use of foreign tax credits, even if the corporate taxes are paid by entities indirectly held abroad, as long as the distributing entity is domiciled in the same country and it holds directly or indirectly an equity interest of more than 10%.\n\nUnder a tax change in 2020, if the corporate income tax is paid in a third country, different from the distributing country, corporate income taxes paid can also be used as a credit in Chile, as long as the distributing entity holds directly or indirectly an equity interest of more than 10% and the third country has an enforceable double tax treaty with Chile or an exchange of information agreement.\n\nThe bill\n\nIn March 2022, Gabriel Boric became the Chilean president. In his presidential programme, he announced a very ambitious tax reform that was presented before the Congress on July 7 2022.\n\nAmong the proposed amendments, the bill states that the current maximum foreign tax credit of 35% should be reduced to 27% and should only be applicable to corporate income tax and not to final taxes. Also, the indirect tax credit mechanism is proposed to be fully repealed.\n\nIf this is approved, in the author’s opinion, foreign investment and using Chile as a business platform will become less attractive, since the amount of foreign tax credits will be significantly lower, increasing the Chilean tax burden.",
    "How Chile is putting its ageing refrigerators out to pasture": "Rosa Cordero, who is diabetic, remembers a time when she couldn’t store her insulin safely. Her refrigerator was old and unreliable, and she never knew if the temperature was cool enough to store the drug.\n\nNot only was the fridge imperilling her insulin supplies, it was also causing her food to rot, driving up her electricity bills, and hurting the environment.\n\nCordero, who lives in Santiago, the capital of Chile, does not have a lot of money to spend on appliances. But thanks to United for Efficiency (U4E), a United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)-led initiative backed by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), she was able to secure a new, energy-efficient refrigerator.\n\n“It gives me so much joy to have a new fridge. I’ve never had a new one before; now I can keep my insulin fresh,” said Cordero, who added the fridge costs about US$7 a month to operate, down from US$30 for her old one.\n\nIn 2018, U4E established a programme in Chile, with support from Fundación Chile, the Ministry of Energy and private companies such as Hisense, Samsung and Whirlpool, to help consumers access new, energy-efficient refrigerators.",
    "What's next for Chile after voters rejected a new constitution": "What's next for Chile after voters rejected a new constitution\n\nNPR's Ari Shapiro speaks with Antonia Laborde, a reporter for El País in Santiago de Chile after voters in the country rejected a new constitution. Now the country must consider a new path forward.\n\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\n\nNow that voters in Chile have rejected a new constitution, where does the country go from here? The proposal was full of progressive ideals - universal health care, Indigenous rights, abortion protections. And voters shot it down on Sunday by a margin of more than 20 points. Antonia Laborde is a correspondent in Santiago for El Pais, and she's here to talk about the path forward. Welcome.\n\nANTONIA LABORDE: Hello. Thank you for inviting me.\n\nSHAPIRO: President Gabriel Boric is already talking about a process that would lead to another constitutional proposal. And today he announced a new cabinet. How does he believe a second attempt to pass a new constitution would go differently from the first?\n\nLABORDE: Well, President Boric has called the leaders of the political parties and Congress to define how they will continue the constitutional process that he obviously supports. But it will be the Congress that defines the rules of this new game. Now, Boric may stand out a bit and focus more on governing. Surely we will see the president more focused on security and economic issues now.\n\nSHAPIRO: I'm curious what voters are telling you. When you talk to Chileans, what do they tell you about their reasons for rejecting the new constitution?\n\nLABORDE: Well, I heard the most enlightening thing in a town called San Pedro de Melipilla. This was the municipality of the metropolitan region that had participated the least in the entry referendum in October 2020. On that occasion, the vote was voluntary. And the people had to answer whether or not they want any constitution. On Sunday, the vote was mandatory. I can say two things here. There was a huge lack of information. They knew little, and what they knew was often not true. And second, for many, it was a referendum on the management of Boric, not the constitutional proposal.\n\nSHAPIRO: Two years ago, four out of five Chilean voters wanted to scrap the old constitution. So do you see a contradiction between that vote and this one? Is there a way to move forward and bridge those two realities?\n\nLABORDE: Well, in my point of view, since the riot of 2019, the political class is much more polarized than the citizens. People took the streets massively to protest against the inequalities in this country. Later, they may simply choose to change the Constitution. For me, the division is in the elite and not in the streets. The people want changes, but they simply felt that the constitutional proposal didn't suit them.\n\nSHAPIRO: How big of a factor was misinformation?\n\nLABORDE: Well, it was undoubtedly an election marred by fake news. The people against the proposal say that the new constitution will eliminate the flag, that it will be possible to abort up to nine months of pregnancy. Another recurring falsehood was been the private property will be confiscated under the new constitution. You know that we're living in times when social media campaigns are full of fake news, and it's very difficult to stop them. But save that, I think that it's important to clarify that the 3 million-plus voters who reject the proposal can't be attributed to fake news alone only.\n\nSHAPIRO: Yeah. This was a major blow to President Boric. Is he the man to lead the country into its next chapter? Do you think he can recover from this?\n\nLABORDE: Well, I think that this is an opportunity for Gabriel Boric. He can become the president who leaves behind a new constitution. So we may see decisions that are not very popular for the hardest left but more helpful for agreements. So we will see.\n\nSHAPIRO: That's Antonia Laborde, a journalist based in Santiago reporting for El Pais. Thank you very much.\n\nLABORDE: Thank you.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SLUM VILLAGE SONG, \"FALL IN LOVE\")\n\nCopyright © 2022 NPR. All rights reserved.

    "FIFA rejects Chile appeal over Ecuador's 2022 World Cup place": "Chile had claimed Ecuadorian player Byron Castillo was ineligible to play during tournament qualifiers. Christian Alvarenga/Getty Images\n\nChile has lost its appeal to FIFA to replace Ecuador at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, the world football governing body announced on Friday.\n\nFIFA dismissed Chile's argument that Ecuador player Byron Castillo was actually Colombian and ineligible to play in tournament qualifying, in which Castillo made eight appearances for Ecuador.\n\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, MLS, more (U.S.)\n\nFIFA said its appeal judges \"deemed that on the basis of the documents presented, the player was to be considered as holding permanent Ecuadorian nationality in accordance\" with football's legal statutes.\n\nThe verdict, which upholds a FIFA disciplinary ruling from June and will likely be taken to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), keeps Ecuador on track to play in Qatar -- they face the hosts in the opening game of the World Cup in Doha on Nov. 20. The Netherlands and Senegal are also in Group A.\n\nHowever, Chile's legal challenge can continue.\n\nThe Chilean football federation has said it intends to appeal against FIFA's verdict to sport's highest court -- CAS in Lausanne, Switzerland -- which can organise an urgent hearing and ruling ahead of the World Cup.\n\n\"This is a dark day for football and for the credibility of the system,\" Jorge Yunge, general secretary of the Chilean Football Federation, said.\n\n\"The footballing world heard a player who helped Ecuador qualify for the FIFA World Cup admit he was born in Colombia and that he gained an Ecuadorian passport using false information. No wonder he refused to participate in the FIFA hearing. What does it say about [the] appeal committee that, confronted with all this, still they fail to act?\n\n\"Of course, we will refer this to the Court of Arbitration for Sport because the weight of evidence is clear, and we urge the appeal committee to deliver the grounds of the decision very quickly because there were enough unjustifiable delays and postponements in this case.\"\n\nChile claimed to have evidence proving Castillo is Colombian and should not have appeared for Ecuador.\n\nChile prepared its case after the World Cup draw was made on April 1, and after FIFA and Qatari organizers sold thousands of tickets and accommodation rooms to Ecuador fans.\n\n\"I have never seen in my entire life as a lawyer an injustice like this one,\" said Eduardo Carlezzo, lawyer for the Chilean Football Federation.\n\n\"There are a huge number of documents that, alone, prove without any reasonable doubt that the player was born in Colombia. In addition to that, everyone heard his confession, given during an official investigation carried by the own Ecuadorian Federation. Furthermore, the player joked with the system by not attending a hearing and nothing of that produced any effect. What else is needed?\n\n\"It clearly seems that anything we could be able to file would not be enough to validate the claim. Sad day for football and for the fair play. The message is clear: cheating is allowed. We will appeal to CAS.\"\n\nHad Ecuador forfeited all eight games Castillo played, Chile would have risen to the fourth automatic qualification place in the South American qualifying group. Ecuador would have dropped out of contention.\n\nFIFA's legal statutes include a section on national team eligibility when a state government has granted citizenship to players.\n\n\"Any person holding a permanent nationality that is not dependent on residence in a certain country is eligible to play for the representative teams of the association of that country,\" according to the statutes.\n\nThe appeal hearing on Thursday was held remotely from Zurich with only the three judges present. The chief judge overseeing the case was Neil Eggleston, an American who served as White House counsel in the second administration of Barack Obama.\n\nThe FIFA appeals committee rarely overturns a ruling by the football body's disciplinary committee.\n\nChile has filed complaints against an opponent's player in back-to-back World Cup qualifying tournaments.\n\nIn the 2018 World Cup qualifying group, Bolivia forfeited two games in which it fielded an ineligible player as a late substitute. FIFA received complaints from Chile and Peru regarding Bolivia defender Nelson Cabrera, who was born in Paraguay and had previously played for Paraguay's national team.\n\nBolivia lost an appeal at CAS, which said FIFA was right to investigate even when protests were filed weeks after the games were played.\n\nThat case ultimately harmed Chile. Three extra points awarded to Peru lifted it above Chile and into an intercontinental playoff that it won to advance to the 2018 tournament in Russia.\n\nFIFA then wrote stricter rules for the 2022 World Cup requiring all players in qualifying games to produce a \"valid permanent international passport\" for inspection by match officials.",

The winning Seafood Team Leaders will experience the pristine marine environment and sustainable efforts that will allow them to educate our guests about salmon and mussel farming in Chile.\"\n\nThe U.S., the leading market for salmon\n\nGrabois explained that, in the case of salmon, Chile is the second-largest exporter in the world and that the United States is the leading market for this product. \"Given the conditions of the southernmost sea in the world, the Chilean salmon has unparallel characteristics in terms of freshness,\" he said.\n\nAccording to him, \"Chilean salmon is a food with a high content of protein and unique flavor that provides a highly nutritious, healthy, and sustainable diet. Besides, it is easy to cook and quite versatile.\"\n\nFood innocuousness and sustainability are other features of this product. \"More than 70% of the salmon companies in Chile are certified for their good practices,\" he added.\n\nThe ProChile representative stressed that \"this industry plays a key role in the development of the South of Chile, not only due to the jobs that are created —70 thousand people work in this sector— but also due to the innovations of the goods and services that are exported to the rest of the world.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Chilean mussel is a high-quality product that is 100% natural, hatched in the cleanest and coldest South Pacific waters that come from Antarctica. \"It is a healthy, nutritious, and delicious product that represents the best of the Chilean shellfish,\" said Pedro Ovalle, president of the Commercial Committee at AmiChile, the mussel farmers association.\n\n\"Just like salmon, most companies that produce mussels have innocuousness and sustainability certification,\" added Ovalle. He also highlighted that \"the U.S. market leads the industry's export growth, with a 3.7% annual rise between January and July of 2022, compared with a 12.7% drop in global terms.\"\n\nGrabois invited people who live in Indiana, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia to visit the nearest Giant Eagle to learn about the more than 30 available products, among them fresh salmon, frozen salmon, Coho salmon, ready-to-eat salmon, dressed salmon, stuffed salmon, and mussels.\n\n\"Both salmon and mussels can be cooked and eaten with other Chilean products that are very well-known worldwide, such as olive oil, wine, and fruits,\" said the ProChile representative.\n\nAbout ProChile:\n\nProChile is an institution of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that promotes the sale of Chilean goods and services worldwide.\n\nThrough a network of more than 50 international offices and 16 offices in different regions of Chile, teams of specialized professionals work to strengthen the country's position in international markets, spread opportunities to invest in Chile, and promote tourism.

    "Chile’s Millennial President Is a New Kind of Leftist Leader": "Gabriel Boric climbs into the back of the gigantic black SUV waiting outside his house. It’s a cold morning in mid-August—winter in Santiago—and the Chilean President is enveloped in a slightly-too-long gray coat, making him look even younger than his 36 years. As the car rolls through city streets, windows down, pedestrians spot him on his way to work and let out whoops or an affectionate “Presi!” Boric laughs and waves, but then bows his head to nervously scan the front pages of Chile’s newspapers.\n\nThere’s plenty to be nervous about. Since taking office in March, Chile’s youngest-ever leader has been shepherding his country through a moment of historic uncertainty. For decades, Chile was touted as Latin America’s economic success story, with a business-friendly, small-government model creating relative wealth, and political stability, for its 19 million inhabitants. That narrative, however, concealed a long-simmering anger among many ordinary Chileans who, with little government support and expensive private services, struggle to make ends meet. In 2019, anger erupted: a small subway-fare hike set off massive, messy, months-long protests over inequality. Then politicians agreed to replace Chile’s constitution, a dictatorship-era document that underpins its market-driven economic system.\n\nRead More: Read the Transcript of TIME’s Interview With Chile’s President Gabriel Boric\n\nBoric, Chile’s most left-wing leader in half a century, owes his presidency to that upheaval. He was elected in December 2021, promising to lead Chile’s transition into the fairer country demanded by protesters. Five months into his term, it’s crunch time: in a Sept. 4 referendum, Chileans will vote on whether to approve a new constitution that offers sweeping progressive reforms, from a new health system to tighter controls on the mining industry. Supporters, including Boric, say it would make Chile a more democratic country and guarantee equality for marginalized groups; opponents say it would destroy the economy.\n\nAnd so the millennial President finds himself guiding his country through a kind of midlife crisis. “It’s a lot of responsibility, for sure,” Boric says after arriving at his bright, cluttered office in La Moneda, Chile’s presidential palace. “But I wake up every morning excited to keep working on this.”\n\nPhotograph by Luján Agusti for TIME\n\nBoric’s rise is part of a regional shift to the left. After a decade of right-wing domination, leftists have recently won power in five of Latin America’s six largest economies, many on platforms to fight inequality. The largest, Brazil, may join them after October elections.\n\nBut Boric is also something new. An older generation of Latin American leftists, including many still active today, have often made troubling sacrifices—disregarding the environment, democracy, or human rights—in pursuit of a socialist society. Boric says those issues are a core part of his progressive ideology. And although he became famous in Chile in his 20s as a shaggy-haired, radical student leader, today’s Boric is no firebrand—even if some may want him to be. “I think that as a society we should aspire to forms of organization that go beyond capitalism, but it’s not like I can say, ‘Capitalism ends today,’” Boric says, rapping the table with his knuckles, in a brief imitation of more militant figures.\n\nIn person, Boric is warm and quick to laugh, but he’s not relaxed. There’s an intensity buzzing beneath the surface. Over the course of several hours with TIME in La Moneda, he sometimes carries a pen and paper to take notes, listening with a furrowed brow. When he hears criticism, he scrunches up his face as if chewing on a hard math problem. Sometimes he agrees. “You have to keep doubting yourself, and listening to others, or you’ll forget why you’re here,” he says, in a rapid tumble of Chilean Spanish. “Sometimes that means going a little more slowly. I always say: we’re going slowly because we’re going far.”\n\nHow far depends on the Sept. 4 vote. Some Chileans have a growing sense that Boric is letting their country go off the rails: inflation is at a 28-year high, the peso’s value at an all-time low, and violent crime is surging. Boric’s approval rating stands at 38%, and polls now suggest that a majority of voters plan to reject the new constitution—a major blow to his agenda. Whatever happens, the world is watching the young President. “If Boric succeeds, I think it will have tremendous influence beyond Chile’s borders,” says Brian Winter, editor in chief of Americas Quarterly. “It will show that a new kind of leftist leader is possible.”\n\nBoric checks his phone in the corridor of La Moneda presidential palace on Aug. 12. Luján Agusti for TIME\n\nBoric grew up in Punta Arenas, a city of roughly 116,000 in remote southern Patagonia, where the wind blows so fiercely that streets have railings to stop people falling. The eldest of three boys, Boric was more bookish than his brothers, spending hours as a child reading novels brought home from work trips by his father, a Chilean engineer of Croatian descent—hence the pronunciation Bor-itch. Adventure stories were his favorite: tales of charming pirates, and children battling monsters.\n\nBut when he was 12 he came across a fantastical story that didn’t make sense to him. It was 1998, and Augusto Pinochet, the dictator who ruled Chile for 17 years, had just been arrested in London. Boric saw a group of women protesting on the news: they said Pinochet had made their relatives disappear. How could he make someone disappear, Boric wondered, if he wasn’t a magician?\n\nRead more: Chile Is Trying To Shed the Last Remnants of Its Pinochet-Era Dictatorship\n\nHe traded novels for history books to find the answer: in 1973, Chile’s military, led by Pinochet, had violently overthrown the country’s democratically elected Marxist President, Salvador Allende, installing a right-wing regime in his place. Pinochet was aided by the Nixon Administration, which was set on halting the spread of left-wing ideology during the Cold War. By the time Chile’s dictatorship ended in 1990, it had tortured and imprisoned nearly 30,000 opponents and executed 2,279. A further 1,162 victims would never be found.\n\nLearning about Pinochet sparked Boric’s political interest in his teens. He soon discovered other ways in which Chile’s dark past still loomed over its present. Pinochet, with the help of a group of right-wing U.S. economists, had turned his country into a laboratory for neoliberalism—a philosophy that sees free-market capitalism as the solution to all of society’s problems. (Decades later, during his election campaign, Boric would pledge that “if Chile was the cradle of neoliberalism, it’ll also be its grave.”) Pinochet shrank the role of the Chilean state, favoring private enterprise in the provision of education, health care, pensions, and even water.\n\nChile’s system has since lifted millions out of poverty. From 2000 to 2017, the share of Chileans living on less than $5.50 a day fell from 30% to 6.4%, per the World Bank. “That was important. But at the same time we were building a really unequal society,” Boric says. The cost of living has surged, and services exist in a two-tier system, where only those with money can access quality. For instance, 6 in 10 Chilean students pay to attend high school; Boric and his brothers were among them. “When I knew the history, I understood that the privileges that you have in a society as unequal as Chile are sustained by the fact that others don’t have them. It made me really angry.”\n\nHe expressed his anger as many teenagers do: he wore grungy pants and a lumberjack shirt, and grew out “the little facial hair I could,” he says. He got into punk and rock music: Pearl Jam, Metallica, Tool, Chile’s Los Prisioneros, and Argentina’s Charly García. (He still listens to music “almost constantly” and says rock dominates his playlists, despite the reputation he gained as a “Swiftie” when he tweeted support for Taylor Swift, after meeting her Chilean fan base: “They adopted me. I like Red, Folklore, ‘Cardigan.’ But it’s not the style of music I’m most into.”) Over meals, Boric would debate politics with his centrist father, and share “mediocre” poems he had written.\n\nBoric also found ways to act on his feelings. In 2000, at 14, he helped relaunch Punta Arenas’ high school student union, at a time when Chile was experiencing a revitalization of the student movement. A once potent political force, it had been repressed by Pinochet before petering out in the 1990s in a period of relative political apathy. Boric’s generation brought it roaring back. At 20, while studying law at the University of Chile in Santiago, he joined months of marches and building occupations by school and college students, demanding a fairer education system.\n\nBoric in 2012 with student leaders, including future official spokesperson Camila Vallejo, right. Fernando Lavoz—NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\nBoric became well known in 2011, when he was 25. That year, during another mass mobilization of hundreds of thousands of students, he was elected leader of Chile’s national federation of student unions. After his victory, an excited Boric told reporters that young people were tired of “the government and the political class, who want to commercialize all aspects of our lives.” A movement was coming, he said, “which would transform not only education, but the entire country.”\n\nThat movement had a few victories over the next few years. In 2013, four prominent figures from the student movement, including Boric, won seats in Congress, which was then made up of 158 legislators. But change was frustratingly slow, even under center-left President Michelle Bachelet (2014 to 2018). That’s partly because of Chile’s rigid constitution, written under Pinochet in 1980. Though it doesn’t explicitly endorse neoliberalism, it acts as a kind of ideological straitjacket by making many legislative changes dependent on approval by a constitutional court and a large majority in Congress. Those are hard to come by, thanks to an electoral system designed to produce stalemates. In 1979, the constitution’s writer said he aimed to “restrain whoever is governing” so that “if our adversaries get into power, they’ll be forced to take actions not so different to the ones we’d want.”\n\nFor a long time it seemed nothing could blast through that stagnation. Then, from October to December of 2019, roughly 3 million Chileans—some 16% of the population—took to the streets, led by students and other young people. The protests were sometimes violent; city centers were smashed up and set alight, and police responded brutally. Around 30 people died and hundreds were imprisoned by the government of right-wing President Sebastián Piñera. The period is now known as the social explosion.\n\nRead More: I Was Shot and Lost My Sight for Protesting Inequality in Chile. We Need to Keep Demanding Justice\n\nBoric, then in his second term as a Congressman, joined some of the protests, sharing many of the organizers’ concerns. But he was no longer the activist of his 20s. “We couldn’t just be agitators,” he says. “We had to offer an alternative, something to channel the conflict in some direction.”\n\nThat thinking led Boric, in November 2019, to champion an agreement with Piñera and other politicians to hold a referendum on whether or not to launch a project to replace the Pinochet-era constitution. It was controversial: left-wing politicians largely rejected the deal, fearing a constitutional process led by Piñera, a 72-year-old billionaire, would be designed to prevent real change, and represent a betrayal of the imprisoned protesters. In December 2019, a group of young protesters attacked Boric, emptying beer cans over his head while he sat on a park bench in Santiago. “You sold us out,” they shouted. In a video of the incident, Boric remains still. “I was reflecting in that moment,” he recalls. “They were accusing me of something that I didn’t believe I had done. And I still don’t. But it was hard, and it wasn’t the only time.”\n\nFor many, though, Boric’s willingness to work with political rivals legitimized him as a viable leader. Chile held that first referendum in October 2020, with 78% of voters opting to replace the constitution. Then the time came to replace Piñera as well, at scheduled 2021 presidential elections. In a surprise result in July 2021, a left-wing electoral coalition chose Boric as its candidate, over a Communist Party politician who had opposed the deal. In December, at the second round of the presidential election, Boric won 56% of the vote—a lead of 12 percentage points over José Antonio Kast, a far-right lawmaker with ties to the Pinochet regime.\n\nStephania Escobar, a handicraft seller at a central Santiago market in her 50s, was among those who voted for Boric. “It’s a big collective task we have on our hands. But he’s like a bridge,” she says, “a bridge to the changes we want to make.”\n\nWhen asked to describe their new President, many Chileans speaking to TIME use the word cercano (close) because Boric’s political style is less formal than most. He talks openly, for example, about his struggles with obsessive-compulsive disorder, which led him to check into a psychiatric clinic in 2018, and which still manifests in small gestures he makes at public events. He speaks candidly with TIME about gaining weight during his campaign, prompting him to start boxing in the mornings before work.\n\nRead More: Chile’s Protest Reflect Our Unequal Times\n\nBoric also lives physically closer to ordinary Chileans. The country has no official presidential residence, and previous leaders, largely elected in their 60s and 70s, have favored posh neighborhoods to the north of Santiago. After his election, Boric and his partner Irina Karamanos—a 32-year-old feminist activist he began dating in 2019—moved into a modest house in Yungay, a central neighborhood. Their neighbors are families and students living in subdivided, run-down buildings, and crime rates are high. The President’s team grumbles that he insists on walking to buy bread nearby, causing a minor security headache. Boric has also tried to make his office more approachable. He reopened a public square outside La Moneda that was previously cordoned off, and speaks with crowds gathered there most days.\n\nSome of it can feel a little contrived. But Tomás Boric, 29, the President’s youngest brother, says the down-to-earth image reflects what he saw growing up. “Most people spoke to me like a kid, but Gabriel never did,” he says. “He listened to me. He gave me his time. He does that for everyone.”\n\nBoric celebrates his victory with supporters on election night on Dec. 19. Felipe Figueroa—SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images\n\nBoric now finds himself at the helm of a bold social experiment. For decades, Latin America’s vast gap between rich and poor—one of the largest in the world—has stunted economies and fostered disruption: rapid swings from right to left, guerrilla wars, strongmen, coups, and corruption. In Chile, many hope that rewriting the constitution could address inequality in a uniquely democratic way—and perhaps serve as an example for other nations. “I feel so lucky to have been born at this time,” says Ericka Ñanco. Elected to Congress in November at age 29 to represent the southern Araucanía region, she is one of the youngest members of Boric’s coalition. “In other eras, the dreams of young people were crushed. Now we have the opportunity to change things.”\n\nThe new constitution was drafted by an assembly of 155 representatives, chosen at a special election in May 2021: 77 are women, and 17 are from Chile’s Indigenous communities, proportional to their 13% share of the population. Proponents of the new constitution say it imagines a better country, one that balances economic development with workers’ rights, environmental protections, and gender equality. It particularly emphasizes the rights of marginalized groups, including the autonomy of the Indigenous peoples, who were not even recognized in Pinochet’s constitution, over their own cultures, land, and institutions. The document calls for drastic changes to Chile’s political structures, as well as new national health care and education systems (private operators would remain, but with more oversight). In August, an international group of prominent progressive economists said the draft “prepares Chile for a new century of equitable growth.”\n\nNot everyone is sure of that outcome. Winter of Americas Quarterly says “the hope is that Chile is able to achieve developed world status in the next 10 or 20 years,” if it can reduce inequality, a major barrier to development. “I think that’s very much on the table. But the fear is that Chile will lose what made it an imperfect success story over the last 30 years.” That is, it could trade its stable market-driven economy for the stagnant, inflation-prone chaos of its neighbor Argentina, hurting poor as well as rich Chileans.\n\nRead More: Gabriel Boric: The Leftist Millennial Who Could Lead One of Latin America’s Wealthiest and Most Unequal Countries\n\nFor Kenneth Bunker, a Chilean pollster, the new constitution has too many flaws to accept. He sees it as a mishmash of the 155 assembly members’ diverse priorities. “It over-regulates so much that there will be a lot of fights about enacting it.” There are also specific concerns: a plan to abolish the Senate, for example, would leave many pieces of legislation subject to only one chamber’s approval, undermining Chile’s consensus-based political culture. Conservatives are also worried about the breadth of proposed spending: the Economist dubbed the document “a fiscally irresponsible left-wing wish list.” Some in Chile argue the document does not accurately reflect the wishes of the general population because turnout for the elections for the constitutional assembly was only 43%. More than half of the representatives chosen came from left or center-left blocs. Many others were progressive-leaning independents, while less than a third came from the right, according to Chilean media.\n\nBoric accepts that some parts of the text need more clarity before they become the law of the land. “There are always things that could be improved, and we’re having that debate,” he says. “But it’s a big step forward for Chile.” He is urging voters to approve it, promising Congress will reform the document after it passes.\n\nIt’s unclear if that will happen. Alongside legitimate debate, opponents of the new constitution have mounted a powerful misinformation campaign on social media and in paper leaflets. Among the false claims circulating are that the draft would abolish Chile’s police force, ban the sale of bottled water, allow abortion at any stage of pregnancy, and outlaw private property. Given the actual text runs to 170 pages of academic language, many voters are relying on others to interpret it for them. The most ardent opponents claim that adopting it would be Chile’s first step toward becoming the new Venezuela—whose socialist economy has imploded over the past decade—and that Boric is enthusiastically leading them down that path.\n\nIt may be true that Chile’s Communist Party makes up a fifth of Boric’s coalition in the lower house of Congress. But the President himself belongs to the more center-left Social Convergence Party, and his aspirations lie closer to European-style social democracy. “I don’t see a state controlling everything like in the socialisms of the 20th century, which failed,” he says. “We have to take ownership of that failure.”\n\nDeeply marked by the memory of the Pinochet regime, Boric is outspoken about violations of democracy and human rights—whether they come from the right or left. He has criticized far-left leaders in Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua who have embraced authoritarianism—a break from older leftists in the region, who tend to keep quiet about abuses on their own side. That attitude frustrates Boric, he says with a sigh. “I can’t get outraged when rights are violated in Palestine but not in Nicaragua, because when the defense of human rights is partial, it loses legitimacy. In Chile, we’re going to do things differently.”\n\nThe president peeks out from the balcony of the presidential house, Palacio de la Moneda, Aug. 12—the same one he used for his speech on the day of his inauguration as president. Luján Agusti for TIME\n\nWalking around the extravagantly upholstered furniture and high-ceilinged corridors of La Moneda, a museum-like colonial building where Presidents have worked since the 1800s, Boric can look a little out of place. He could be a hipster barista, with his trendy beard and tattoos peeking out of his shirt, or maybe a young -professor— a studious type who reels off suggested reading lists on request.\n\nMany Chileans seem happy to have a young President. But Boric is also battling a perception that he and his team, which includes several former student activists, are inexperienced. Some episodes feel like minor misfires: in rethinking the role of First Lady, Boric’s girlfriend briefly renamed her office “Irina Karamanos’ Cabinet,” leading to claims that she was personalizing the institution. Some feel ridiculous: right-wing media attacked Boric for leaving his fly down at an official meeting. (“Now I’m always worried when I’m getting out of the car,” he says.)\n\nBut Boric has also made some serious U-turns. In April, bowing to pressure from his left, he proposed allowing Chileans to withdraw money from their pension pots, despite having expressed fears that such moves worsen inflation. (The plan was rejected by Congress.) “He seems to draw a line in the sand. And then something happens and he has to follow others back over it,” says Bunker.\n\nThe most serious stumble so far has been on security. As a Congressman, Boric condemned Piñera’s decision to deploy the military to Araucanía, where small separatist groups from the Indigenous Mapuche community are engaged in a violent conflict with forestry companies. Security forces have killed several Mapuche people in high-profile cases. But in April, Boric remilitarized the region’s roads. The apparent about-face left the impression that Boric’s team doesn’t know what it’s doing, according to Salvador Millaleo, a Mapuche lawyer. “They did not prepare enough,” he says. “They underestimated both the importance and complexity of this issue.”\n\nBoric says his government “may have been a bit headstrong” in its initial approach to the conflict. “I am still convinced that the state of emergency is not the solution,” he says. But, he adds, “I am the President of all Chileans. So sometimes I have to do things I don’t like.” He pauses and, speaking slowly, disagrees that his U-turns indicate a failure of leadership. “Changing your position isn’t a weakness, as long as it’s coherent with your principles. I’m more concerned about people who can never change their mind.”\n\nBoric is hoping Chileans have not changed their minds about rewriting the constitution, though. If voters approve the new draft on Sept. 4, the national transformation Boric wants will begin in earnest: Congress will embark on a years-long project to draft new legislation. If they reject it, as polls suggest they will, Boric says the huge mandate from the October 2020 referendum will still apply: Chile would start again from scratch, holding elections for a fresh constitutional assembly to write a new draft. If that happens, parts of his agenda may be left in limbo.\n\nBut Boric says there’s still a lot he can do for Chile in the meantime. His government has pushed through a 17% minimum wage hike, and recently announced a bill to cut the workweek from 45 to 40 hours. In July, they unveiled a major tax reform to raise levies on high earners, capital gains, and mining companies. And after Congress approved a climate law in March, Boric’s Environment Minister, a climate scientist, has begun drawing up Chile’s plan to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\nRead more: An Indigenous Rights Leader Is Trying to Rewrite Chile’s Constitution to Put its Ecosystems First\n\nBoric also has wide discretion over foreign policy. He says he wants to refocus regional relationships away from 20th century ideological alliances, toward cooperation on climate action. A key aim is to band Latin America together “under one voice” to pressure richer countries to cut their emissions faster. That could include “making the exports of raw materials or clean energy conditional on changes in consumption behavior in more developed countries,” he says. (Chile holds major reserves of copper and lithium, essential for renewable technologies like electric cars.) He wants to attend October’s U.N. climate conference in Egypt to begin those discussions, he says. “Everyone has a responsibility, but some are more responsible than others. And we have to demand they meet theirs.”\n\nWhen Boric was preparing for his presidential portrait in the run-up to his inauguration in March, he and his team looked at those of all his predecessors. Each one seems to fit their era: 19th century colonial liberators in their military uniforms; early 20th century land barons in refined bow ties. Then Allende in 1970, slouching in a chair: unaware of what would happen to his government three years later. Next, Pinochet, another military man, severe and confident of his hold over Chile. Finally, the slick-suited statesmen—and woman—of the neoliberal era.\n\nBoric was sure of one thing: he wouldn’t wear a tie. He had long eschewed them, causing a minor sensation in the Chilean press. The dress code for leaders has changed over the centuries, he says, from “French kings in high heels and stockings” to “Barack Obama sitting on top of his desk.” He’s pretty confident that in 20 years, more Presidents will have nixed the tie. “I’m part of a transition here.”\n\nHe ended up with a photo in which he looks a little stiff, standing in front of the Pacific Ocean. It’s impossible to know what teleological meanings people will draw from it in a few decades. Is this the President defeated by a referendum a few months into his term? The one who blew up Chile’s economy and lost control of its security? Or the one who transformed his country and created a new model for Latin America’s left? On this, Boric is less willing to make predictions. “You can’t worry about how history will unfold,” he says. “If you do, you’ll get dizzy.”\n\n— With reporting by Solcyre Burga and Anisha Kohli/New York\n\nWrite to Ciara Nugent at ciara.nugent@time.com.",

    "Chile’s environmental watchdog opens new overproduction case against Australis": "Chile’s environmental watchdog opens new overproduction case against Australis\n\nChile’s Superintendency of the Environment (SMA) has opened a new sanctioning process against Australis Mar for exceeding the authorized production limits at one of its grow-out centers – the seventh such action taken by the environmental watchdog against the salmon-farming firm.\n\nAustralis Mar is a division of Puerto Varas, Chile-based Australis Seafoods, which was acquired in 2018 by Chinese foodservice giant Joyvio, a subsidiary of Legend Holdings.\n\nSMA's latest investigation pertains to Australis’ Punta Lobos center, located in the Kawésqar National Reserve, in Chile’s southernmost region of Magallanes – an area that has been at the center of national attention, including a documentary produced by National Geographic that called for the reserve to be declared a national park, a move that would effectively ban salmon production there. According to the latest documents filed on SMA’s national information system for environmental control, SNIFA, Sernapesca – the country’s fisheries and aquaculture service – found that during the November 2017 through August 2019 production cycle the Punta Lobos center produced a total of 7,777 metric tons (MT) of Atlantic salmon, surpassing its environmentally permitted limit of 4,320 MT by 80 percent, or 3,457 MT.\n\nSMA has six other sanctioning processes currently ongoing against Australis Mar: one for alleged violations at a salmon farm in the Biobío region, two for violations at grow-out centers in the Aysén region (Salas 5 and Costa), and three for alleged violations in the Magallanes region (Córdova 3, Estero Retroceso and Morgan). All three of Australis’ Magallanes farms involved in the sanctioning process are located within the Kawésqar National Reserve. The new case in Punta Lobos joins cases of alleged overproduction at Australis’ Córdova 3, Morgan, Estero Retroceso, and Costa farms.\n\n“Regarding the SMA notification on alleged faults at the Punta Lobos farming center, located in the Magallanes region, related to a production cycle begun in 2017, the company is reviewing the background information that the authority has provided us to-date in order to collaborate and provide all the information that is necessary, thus building a correct and timely proposal for the compliance program if the observed deviations are confirmed,” Australis said in a statement sent to SeafoodSource.\n\nAccording to current Chilean salmon-farming regulations, companies facing sanctions can agree to join an improvement program, which must include measures aimed at promoting satisfactory compliance with all environmental regulations. If Chilean authorities approve the proposal and the company adheres to the plan for a set period of time, the administrative sanction can be waived.\n\nHowever, in the same accusatory document, SMA said it had also detected overproduction in the current cycle underway at Punta Lobos, which began in October 2021 and which is expected to end in January 2023. In August 2022, SMA found the Punta Lobos center had reached 4,443 MT of biomass, exceeding its limit by 123 MT, or 3 percent over the allowed maximum in its permitting documents.\n\n“It should be noted that the previous cycle (2017-2019) reached overproduction at 14 months, out of a total period of 18 months, obtaining an average harvest weight of 7.3 kilograms. In the case of the current cycle (2021-2023), overproduction was reached in the eleventh month, obtaining an average weight of 3.7 kilograms for each specimen, so it is highly likely that upon reaching the end of the current cycle, the Punta Lobos grow-out center will register even higher levels than the overproduction registered in the 2017-2019 cycle,” the document, which was signed by Jaime Jeldres García, the investigating prosecutor in SMA’s Department of Sanctions and Compliance, said.\n\nThe two infractions attributed to Australis at the Punta Lobos center are categorized by SMA as serious, meaning the company faces a punishment that could include the revocation of the farm’s environmental permit, immediate closure of the farm, and a fine of up to the equivalent of CLP 3.62 billion (USD 3.9 million, EUR 3.9 million).\n\nAccording to the SMA document, yet another breach detected by Sernapesca at Punta Lobos in March 2022 is related to the non-authorized use of physical mechanisms for the application of nanobubbles to modify oxygen levels in the farming center’s seabed. This, however, is considered a lesser infraction compared to overproduction.\n\nAmid growing questions in Chile around the environmental sustainability of the country’s USD 5.2 billion (EUR 5.2 billion) salmon-farming industry, including by Chile President Gabriel Boric, regulatory authorities have stepped up their scrutiny of the industry’s operations. In July 2022, SMA filed a complaint against salmon farmer Marine Farm for overproduction and alteration of the seabed at operations of the salmon grow-out center Isla Partida, located in the Aysén region.\n\nIn a separate case, Punta Arenas, Chile-based salmon farmer Nova Austral faces sanctions that may cost it up to 20 percent of its total production capacity. After determining the farmer had overproduced at three of its centers – Cockburn 14, Cockburn 23, and Aracena 10 – SMA moved to revoke the environmental licenses for the three farms, all located in the Alberto de Agostini National Park. Nova Austral has said it may be forced to shut down its Chilean operations if the sanctions are implemented.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Chile’s Superintendency of the Environment",
    "Human mobility in Chile: Coordination and response of UNHCR, partners and donors during 2021 - Chile": "PROLOGUE\n\nThe last two years of the pandemic have been devastating. Border closures increased the departure of people from countries where they suffer persecution, intolerance or human rights violations. In fact, just considering Venezuela, there are already 6 million human beings who left their home in search of a safer place to restart their lives.\n\nThe risks have been dramatic. During the journey, many of them faced conditions that put their lives in check, such as extreme climates, complex geographies, in addition to human trafficking and trafficking criminal networks. In addition, the increase in xenophobia is added as an unfortunate consequence of this situation.\n\nThis scenario has challenged us to strengthen international cooperation and intensify our capacity to respond to this crisis, because poverty and inequality have increased in the region, affecting the most vulnerable people, such as refugees. Thousands of them continue to rely on humanitarian aid to eat and sleep, while access to education and health are a privilege for many families.\n\nThat is why fostering effective local integration becomes one of the biggest challenges to offer long-term solutions that guarantee health, education, housing, among other essential services for refugee and migrant people.\n\nThe world is living in complex times and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the displacement generated by the armed conflict is an unfortunate example that justifies the existence of agencies such as UNHCR to protect people. In addition to this situation that marked the beginning of 2022, in Latin America we continue to face the COVID-19 pandemic and the largest exodus in the history of our region.\n\nFor our Southern Cone region, and especially for our Regional Office covering Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay, obstacles to access to territory and refugee status determination procedures were of great concern in 2021. In this regard, UNHCR advocated to the governments to maintain entry exceptions for people in need of protection, in addition to resuming asylum procedures and implementing alternative options for refugee and migrant people to virtually register their applications or adopt remote interview modalities, among other exceptions.We also work in coordination with civil society, government human rights institutions and public defenders to ensure access in specific cases identified by the office. We made strategic progress with specialized partners who have identified cases, provided support and intervened with the authorities in order to guarantee access to territory and refugee status determination procedures.\n\nSince 2020, thanks to the impact of UNHCR, Uruguay has maintained entry exceptions to authorize access to the territory of people in need of international protection and guaranteed access to the determination of refugee status, RSD procedure, which it does not happened in the other countries. In addition, UNHCR supported the Permanent Secretariat of the National Refugee Commission (CORE) in the development of an abbreviated procedure to analyse and resolve the asylum applications of Venezuelans, which was approved and implemented. The CORE recognized 189 Venezuelan nationals during 2021.\n\nFollowing UNHCR’s advocacy and proposals, Argentina adopted a protocol for conducting remote refugee status determination interviews.In the case of Paraguay, it continued to apply a prima facie approach to Venezuelans and other nationalities, recognising 2,148 Venezuelans and 653 Cubans during 2021.And in Chile, thanks to the support of our donors and the excellent coordination work with our partners, important advances were made that you will know in the next pages.Thus, we can proudly say that the Southern Cone reached great achievements.\n\nIn 2021, together, Argentina, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay, supported more than 15,000 people with health consultations; more than 12,000 with non-food items; 5,000 people with shelter and temporary accommodation; and more than 13,500 with cash assistance. More than 21,500 people were able to obtain counselling and 28,000 were provided with legal assistance. And a particularly relevant fact for our operation: we support more than 200 victims of the scourge of gender violence. Numbers are important because they give a true dimension to the work in the territory, although even more important are the people behind the numbers.\n\nBut we still have a big task ahead of us. The emergency is not over and the work, especially with the host communities, is more necessary than ever. To meet all these needs, we must continue to work as a team. That is why I invite and motivate all the actors of society so that we do not lower our arms. The world is giving us a great lesson and responding with a gesture of humanity and solidarity is the great door to continue saving lives.PROLOGUE / JUAN CARLOS MURILLOUNHCR /HUMAN MOBILITY IN CHILE",
    "Urfa Chile Makes Everything Better, Including This Chocolate Bar": "This is Highly Recommend, a column dedicated to what people in the food industry are obsessed with eating, drinking, and buying right now.\n\nDried chiles were a staple in my household, and my mother always kept three kinds in our pantry: pul biber (flaked chile), kırmızı toz biber (powdered chile), and Urfa biber. The latter, also known as Urfa chile, is my absolute favorite of the three. It’s a souvenir I bring back in bulk whenever I visit my family in Turkey, and I use it on almost everything: Turkish-style poached eggs, fresh salads and mezze, and even leftover pizza. Grown in the hills surrounding Urfa in southeastern Turkey, it’s a purplish-black spice that packs a smoky kick and subtle sweetness, adding serious depth and nuance to any dish or snack—including my favorite Spring & Mulberry chocolate bar.\n\nThere are a lot of fancy chocolates on the market, but Spring & Mulberry is the one I always keep stocked in my snack cabinet. Made with 72% cacao and sweetened only with dates, Spring & Mulberry’s chocolate bars comes in five flavors: Pure Dark Chocolate; Mixed Berry; Medjool Date, Pecan, and Himalayan Salt; Lavender, Bee Pollen, and Rose Petal; and—my go-to—Mango, Urfa Chili, Black Lime.\n\nEach chocolate bar is visually striking, with flecks of smoky Urfa chili flakes from Spicewalla and succulent mango slices pressed into the bar like mosaic tiles. The first time I picked one up at dinner party shop Big Night in Brooklyn, I thought, “Maybe it’ll taste like chocolate-covered dried mangoes.” But when I snapped a piece off and popped it into my mouth, it summoned a bewitching savory sweetness followed by a delightful kick, unlocking a core memory. That one bite transported me right back to my mother's kitchen, where I could always smell the spice in the air.\n\nThanks to the generous amount of dried fruit, the chocolate bar itself is pretty hefty. While I have eaten a whole bar in a single sitting, two squares are usually more than enough to satisfy if I’m in need of a chocolate pick-me-up. The combination of the chocolate and mango tastes heavenly, but it’s the Urfa chili flakes that seal the deal for me. With each bite, I’m reminded of my summers in Turkey—even if I’m just sitting on the couch with my partner in Newark.",
    "Why Chile’s Energy Future Is Everyone’s Energy Future": "This is the second mine from Escondida, Escondida Norte, in Northern Chile. The copper production of ... [+] Escondida is the biggest in the world. (Photo by Oliver Llaneza Hesse/Construction Photography/Avalon/Getty Images) Getty Images\n\nChile is a nation that is incredibly rich in natural resources. In particular, it is rich in two minerals that are most needed by renewable energy and electric vehicles: Copper and lithium.\n\nChile has long been the world’s largest producer and exporter of copper, the super-conductive metal that is integral to pretty much every device, gadget, appliance and means of transportation that creates, uses or moves electricity. Other than oil, copper is perhaps the single most important mineral resource that enables our modern way of life. In 2021, Chile produced 2-1/2 times as much copper as Peru, the second leading global producer.\n\nAlong with Bolivia and Argentina, Chile is also one of three South American nations whose borders intersect in the highly-elevated salt flats basins known as “the lithium triangle,” the world’s largest resource of brine-based lithium. Like copper, lithium is ubiquitous in our lives, although few humans are actually aware of its presence.\n\nA general view of Laguna Colorada located in the Eduardo Abaroa Andean National Fauna Reserve in the ... [+] highlands of San Luis, near the border with Chile, in the Uyuni salt flats, Bolivia on October 7, 2009. The Uyuni salt flats are estimated to contain 10 billion tons of salt - of which 25,000 tons are extracted every year - as well as 100 million tons of lithium, making it one of the largest global reserves of this mineral, according to state officials at the Bolivian Mining Corporation (COMIBOL). The salt flats are a major tourist attraction in Bolivia, with around 60 thousand tourists visiting them every year, where one can find various types of flamingos, giant cacti, geysers, hot springs, volcanoes and colorful ponds. AFP PHOTO/Martin Bernetti - MORE IN IMAGE FORUM (Photo credit should read MARTIN BERNETTI/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images\n\nMost prominently, lithium is used in the lithium-ion batteries we all use in our daily lives, and which are the battery of choice for electric vehicles, and currently dominant in the realm of providing storage backup for wind and solar power.\n\nThis energy transition literally cannot happen without cheap and plentiful supplies of these two critical minerals. As governments of the west attempt to subsidize wind, solar and EVs into critical mass, demand for these two minerals is projected to explode in the coming decades. Copper demand is expected to at least double by 2035, according to an S&P Global study, while the International Energy Agency projects lithium demand to escalate by an almost unimaginable 4,000% by 2040.\n\nThus, in a very significant way, Chile’s energy future is everyone’s energy future.\n\nBut that energy future is about to become quite murky as Chileans prepare to approve a new national constitution on September 4. The draft document is 178 pages long - 7 times the length of the U.S. constitution - and contains 11 chapters and 388 articles. It is a radical shift from Chile’s existing constitution, one so extreme that it has been described by The Economist as “a “fiscally irresponsible left-wing wish list.”\n\nOf particular interest in the draft constitution where mining for copper and extraction of lithium are concerned is Article 145, which reads as follows:\n\nMineral Statute\n\nArticle 145.\n\n1. The State has absolute, exclusive, inalienable and imprescriptible dominion over all mines and mineral substances, metallic, non-metallic, and deposits of fossil substances and hydrocarbons existing in the national territory, with the exception of surface clays, without prejudice to the ownership of the land on which they are located.\n\n2. The exploration, exploitation and use of these substances shall be subject to a regulation that considers their finite, non-renewable nature, intergenerational public interest and environmental protection.\n\nWhile the constitutional convention that drafted the document debated inclusion of an overt nationalization of the country’s mineral extraction industries, it ultimately rejected the proposal. But some observers are concerned that this mineral statute, along with other provisions in the draft, are designed to facilitate the implementation of a de facto nationalization led by current President Gabriel Boric, who has advocated for such a move.\n\nWhile current Chilean law provides for all subsurface minerals to be owned by the government, the mining and extraction of these mineral resources are conducted under concessions made during the presidency of Augusto Pinochet to giant mining companies like Rio Tinto and BHP, along with state-owned mining company CODELCO. A full nationalization of the industry would almost certainly result in disruptions that would inhibit the ability of Chile to grow its mineral production to meet the needs of the energy transition.\n\nRecent polling data indicates Sunday’s referendum vote is likely to fail. But as we have seen in the U.S., the U.K. and elsewhere in recent years, polling data has a disturbing tendency to be wrong.\n\nLike it or not, Chile’s energy future is everyone’s energy future. Sunday’s vote is a key event to the future progression of this energy transition.",
    "MARAD working with Chile to improve security at ports": "In addressing port security in Guyana, Minister of Public Works Juan Edghill has said regulations, training and enhanced inspections of vessels must be balanced to avoid wasted investment.\n\nThe Minister was speaking at the opening of a port security workshop on Monday, when he expounded on illegalities at the country’s entry ports and said this is an issue that the government is continuously trying to tackle.\n\nThe workshop focuses on Port Security and was facilitated after discussions between the Public Works Minister and the Chile Ambassador to Guyana Juan Manuel Pino Vasquez.\n\nThe booming oil sector has created opportunities for Guyana. However, it has also created a new avenue for illegal activities, especially at the border. With this in mind, the Minister said port security needs to be of paramount importance.\n\n“We don’t have people who are properly oriented and trained and equipped with particular world views and perspective to ensure the safety and security of our nations’ sake, it will be a waste of investments,” the Public Works Minister said.\n\nTherefore, he added, “Our government must balance its investment in hardware as well as in human resource development, capacity building institutional strengthening and it is in that collaborative spirit that we engaged Chile in a continuing engagement of the developing of our human resource capacity and strengthening our institution.”\n\nFurther, Edghill said there will be newer monitoring systems in place to ensure that the staff working at ports are not turning a blind eye. One such initiative is part of discussions the Minister is having with MARAD.\n\n“There are a number of new initiatives that we are wondering and deliberating on. And one of the key initiatives that they (MARAD) are talking to me about is ensuring that the people who work at all of our ports are not just cleared by their employer but also cleared by MARAD.”\n\n“We have to prevent the movement of illegal goods through our port…We are working on ensuring that we see everything that happens in all our ports by putting in the necessary infrastructure. We have to ensure that the people who work there are not facilitating illegalities,” he explained.\n\nThe Minister also noted that in order to become better, Guyana must embrace international best practices. As such he expressed gratitude to the government of Chile for extending training of practices used in Chile to Guyanese.",
    "Former Chilean police captain found guilty of assault for blinding woman": "A former Chilean police special forces captain has been found guilty of assault after permanently blinding a woman he shot in the face with a teargas canister during a wave of protests in 2019.\n\nThe court in the capital Santiago found that Patricio Maturana had committed “unlawful coercion resulting in serious and very serious injuries” to Fabiola Campillai who was walking to a bus stop when she was struck. The public prosecutor has requested a 12-year prison sentence.\n\nThe incident happened on 26 November 2019, amid a police crackdown on street demonstrations which had shaken the country. Campillai was on her way to work a night shift at a factory in Santiago.\n\nAs she turned a corner, she was hit in the face by a teargas canister fired by Maturana, one of a group of officers huddled beside an underpass.\n\nCampillai was permanently and irreversibly blinded by the impact, which left her requiring weeks of surgeries and deprived her of her senses of taste and smell.\n\n“[Maturana’s] intention was not to use the weapon according to its [purpose] – to disperse and dissuade crowds with teargas – but rather to do her harm,” said prosecutor Marcela Nilo as she read out the verdict on Thursday.\n\nPolice protocol at the time dictated that teargas cylinders, which were frequently used to quell the often violent protests, should be discharged at a 45-degree angle.\n\nHowever, Maturana, who was only dismissed eight months after the incident following an internal police investigation, shot directly at Campillai from just 50 metres away and at an angle of between zero and five degrees, the court heard.\n\nCampillai’s ordeal has seen her become one of Chile’s most recognisable victims of police brutality, and she was elected as an independent senator representing Santiago in legislative elections in November 2021.\n\nBoth Chilean and international human rights organisations have condemned the heavy-handed police response to the 2019 protests, which left 30 people dead and an estimated 3,000 injured.\n\nChile’s interior minister, Izkia Siches, who assumed the role in March this year when 36-year-old Gabriel Boric became Chile’s youngest ever president, said that the government has “a strict commitment to human rights and particularly the victims”.\n\nCampillai and other members of her family are suing the state for damages separately, seeking more than 2.2bn pesos (£2.1m) in compensation.\n\nMaturana will be sentenced on 10 October.",

Downside risks have materialized, including a tightening of global financial conditions, a slowdown in global growth, and a substantial drop in Chile’s terms of trade. Domestic economic policies are appropriately being recalibrated to mitigate risks and preserve macroeconomic stability, while supporting vulnerable groups. The authorities will continue leveraging on Chile’s very strong fundamentals and policy frameworks to implement an ambitious reform agenda in a challenging external environment."
