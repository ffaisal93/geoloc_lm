    "Germany sued over air pollution levels": "German citizens are suing their government over its failure to bring down air pollution levels to limits recommended by the world's leading scientists.\n\nThe seven claimants, supported by environmental organisations ClientEarth and Deutsche Umwelthilfe [German Environment Help], last week launched the case in the Federal Administrative Court — Germany's highest court.\n\nStudent or retired? Then this plan is for you.\n\nThey argue German law breaches their fundamental rights, since it allows air-pollution levels to be four to five times higher than those the World Health Organization (WHO) deems acceptable.\n\n\"Air pollution may not often be named the official cause of death, but it claims lives — and causes long-term diseases, including cancer, heart problems, shortness of breath and strokes,\" said one of the claimants from Munich, who suffers from asthma.\n\n\"I am now suing for my right to breathe clean and healthy air.\"\n\nThe claimants all come from the country's four most-polluted cities: Berlin, Dusseldorf, Munich and Frankfurt.\n\nWhile the EU set legally-binding air quality standards to tackle air pollution in 2015, the WHO lowered its levels in 2021 — prompting campaigners to urge the EU to align its legislation with science.\n\nThe EU is currently reviewing its main air-quality law, with a proposal expected to come in October.\n\nBut its implementation will not be immediate, meaning EU member states will not be obliged to comply with more strict thresholds for several years.\n\nOver 90 percent of the EU's urban population is exposed to high levels of fine-particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide and ozone above those recommended by the WHO, according to the European Environment Agency.\n\nAnd it is estimated that reducing air pollution to WHO-recommended levels in the EU could prevent 51,213 premature deaths each year.\n\nThere are currently ongoing infringement procedures against 18 member states for failing to implement current EU air-quality rules — including referrals to the European Court of Justice against Romania, Greece, Malta, Italy, and Austria.\n\n\"What's needed here is simple — alignment of national air quality laws with the science laid out by the world's leading experts. This is the bare minimum our leaders should be doing to protect people,\" said Irmina Kotiuk, a lawyer from ClientEarth.\n\nIn the past, climate litigation has successfully led to a reduction in air pollution in Germany.\n\nBetween 2018 and 2019, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels were reduced in several German cities where legal cases over air pollution had been undertaken by environmental groups.\n\nIn the EU, over 400,000 people die prematurely every year as a result of breathing toxic air.",
    "Bundesbank Sees Grim Future As Inflation Starts Ravaging German Economy": "Bundesbank sees grim future as inflation starts ravaging Europe’s largest economy – Photo: Shutterstock; Mo Photography Berlin\n\nGermany’s economy is seen heading into a recession by the end of 2022, hurt by tight energy supply that has raised inflation across Europe.\n\nWith no signs of the Russia-Ukraine war deescalating in the near term, Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, said the nation’s real gross domestic product (GDP) is set to shrink for three straight quarters from July 2022 to March 2023.\n\nIs recession in Europe's biggest economy imminent? In this article we talk about factors that could indicate a possible Germany recession, along with a German economy forecast for the near term.\n\nWhat is a recession?\n\nWhile a recession typically describes a period of decline in economic output, it has no official definition.\n\nEconomists have differed in their views when defining a recession as there have been numerous occasions when economies have undergone less intense and short-lived periods of economic contraction.\n\nThe most widely quoted and well-defined explanation of recession is from Geoffrey Moore, of the National Bureau of Economic Research, which is as follows:\n\n“A recession is a period of decline in total output, income, employment and trade, usually lasting six months to a year and marked by widespread contractions in many sectors of the economy.”\n\nGoing by this definition, an economy is said to technically be in a recession if its real GDP contracts for two consecutive quarters. This is also known as a technical recession.\n\nWhat is your sentiment on DE40? 12207.7 Bullish or Bearish Vote to see Traders sentiment! Market sentiment: Bullish Bearish 71% 29% You voted bullish.

Give DE40 a try Start trading or Try demo\n\nIs Germany in a recession right now?\n\nLet’s look at the quarterly GDP growth rate data published by Eurostat to see whether a recession in Germany has begun.\n\nGermany posted quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) real GDP growth of 0.8% in the September 2021 quarter, after which real GDP growth rate came in flat in the quarter ended December 2021.\n\nIn 2022, the economy of Germany grew 0.8% QoQ in the three months ended March 2022. The latest Eurostat data for the June 2022 quarter showed that Germany’s real GDP inched 0.1% higher over the previous quarter.\n\nThe economic data showed Germany did not enter a technical recession, as of June 2022.\n\nEurostat is expected to report preliminary flash GDP estimates for the September quarter on 31 October 2022.\n\nRussia-Ukraine war and European energy crisis\n\nEurope has suffered more than the rest of the world in its fight against inflation due to its over-dependence on Russian energy imports. Historical data compiled by Eurostat showed Russia was the biggest exporter of natural gas and crude oil to the European Union (EU) in 2020.\n\nToday, hostilities between Russia and Western nations following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 have led to an energy supply crisis in Europe.\n\nNord Stream 1, a natural gas pipeline operated by Russian state-owned company Gazprom that runs from Russia to Germany, has seen multiple shutdowns in 2022, sending energy prices soaring in the EU.\n\nWith winter months approaching amid “extremely tight” gas supply and no signs of the Russia-Ukraine war ending, the outlook looks bleak for European households and industries who may be forced to reduce energy consumption in order to manage limited supplies.\n\nAdding to concerns was Russia’s President Vladimir Putin’s announcement of a “partial mobilisation\" that could call upon an additional 300,000 reservists to serve in the war.\n\nAnalysts at research firm S&P Global expected Russian aggression to be met with harsh economic sanctions in December, which could have a “major impact” on commodity supplies and prices.\n\nIn a bid to reduce its dependence on Russian energy imports, European authorities have been actively increasing diplomatic ties with natural gas suppliers like Norway, Azerbaijan and Egypt to lock in new gas supply for the winter, said S&P Global in a separate note.\n\nUS30 29,285.00 Price -1.150% 1D Chg, % Trade now Swap Short: Swap Long: Long position overnight fee -0.0139% Short position overnight fee 0.0041% Overnight fee time 21:00 (UTC) Spread 2 Trade now DE40 12,207.70 Price -0.800% 1D Chg, % Trade now Swap Short: Swap Long: Long position overnight fee -0.0063% Short position overnight fee -0.0018% Overnight fee time 21:00 (UTC) Spread 1.0 Trade now US500 3,654.50 Price -1.200% 1D Chg, % Trade now Swap Short: Swap Long: Long position overnight fee -0.0138% Short position overnight fee 0.0041% Overnight fee time 21:00 (UTC) Spread 0.9 Trade now NIFTY50 16,994.80 Price -1.410% 1D Chg, % Trade now Swap Short: Swap Long: Long position overnight fee -0.0043% Short position overnight fee -0.0035% Overnight fee time 21:00 (UTC) Spread 5.0 Trade now\n\nTo meet Germany’s energy needs, the county, Europe’s biggest energy consumer, has turned to crude oil from Canada, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Cameroon and Libya.\n\nGermany’s inflation remains elevated\n\nWhile inflation in most parts of the world has shown signs of easing, the latest inflation data revealed that Europe recorded its fastest pace of annualised price growth ever in August 2022 at 9.1%\n\nDespite the recent fall in crude oil prices to below $100 a barrel, energy items were the biggest contributors of European inflation in August, followed by food, alcohol and tobacco and services.\n\nAdding to the worries was core inflation data, which includes volatile items like energy and food prices, showing no signs of easing. Core inflation in Europe scaled a fresh peak of 5.5% in August 2022.\n\nInflation in Germany, as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, increased at an annualised rate of 8.8% in August 2022, higher than its previous peak of 8.7% recorded in May 2022. The Bundesbank noted in its September report:\n\n“This development was mainly fuelled by price increases for unprocessed food but the strong price dynamics likewise continued for processed food and for industrial goods and services.”\n\nHeadline inflation in Germany has increased at a rate of over 8% for four consecutive months since May. The bank added:\n\n“The inflation rate is likely to move into double-digit territory over the next few months overall.”\n\nECB raised interest rates for the first time since 2011\n\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) has been among the most dovish global central banks in 2022. The ECB maintained its negative interest rate regime until July 2022.\n\nThe ECB hiked rates for the first time in over a decade in late-July as it implemented a 50 basis points (bps) rate hike to take policy rates from negative 0.5% to 0%.\n\nThe central bank followed that by hiking its policy rates by 75bps on 8 September, its single largest rate hike since the formation of the European monetary union, according to ING.\n\nFollowing the historic rate hike, Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, was sceptical about how “monetary policy can bring down inflation that is mainly driven by (external) supply-side factors”, according to the recent note:\n\n“At the same time, the size of today’s rate hike will not determine whether or not the eurozone economy slides into recession and will also not make the recession more or less severe.\n\n“Any recession in the eurozone in the winter will be driven by energy prices and not by interest rates.”\n\nThe ECB will have to balance hiking rates to control inflation without hampering economic growth in Germany and other EU nations.\n\nGermany recession outlook for 2022 and beyond\n\nThe Bundesbank said in a mid-September update that the German economy is seeing “mounting signs” of sliding into a recession.\n\nAccording to the Bundesbank, the real GDP of Germany is likely to decrease in the September quarter and is seen shrinking significantly in the final quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023, noting:\n\n“High inflation and uncertainty regarding the supply of energy and its costs will affect not only gas and electricity-intensive industries and their export business and investment, but also private consumption and those service providers dependent on it.”\n\nHaving seen the Euro Area Purchasing Managers' Index (EA PMI) enter contraction territory in September, ANZ Research said in a note:\n\n“The EA PMIs indicated a broadening of the slowdown. Although the Q3 GDP data won’t be released for another month, a European recession may be a reality as the energy crisis, effects of high inflation and heightened anxiety over the war in Ukraine bite.”\n\nThe ECB said in its September report that it expected the real GDP growth to “slow down significantly in the third quarter” due to inflation pressures and rising interest rates:\n\n“Overall, real GDP is expected to contract by 0.1% in the last quarter of 2022 and remain flat in the first quarter of 2023.”\n\nFinally, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expected Germany’s real GDP to grow at 1.2% in 2022 and fall to 0.8% in 2023.\n\nWhen looking at Germany recession forecasts, it’s important to bear in mind that analysts’ forecasts can be wrong.

    "Lindner raises doubts on Germany’s gas levy": "German Finance Minister Christian Lindner questioned whether the gas levy would lead to lower energy prices for consumers | John MacDougall/AFP via Getty Images\n\nGerman Finance Minister Christian Lindner has questioned if efforts to help the country's energy companies tackle soaring energy costs would lead to lower energy prices for local consumers.\n\nSpeaking to German newspaper Bild am Sonntag, Lindner, the head of the country's liberal Free Democratic Party, said the so-called gas levy, the plan to charge Germans a fee to compensate energy companies for skyrocketing wholesale energy costs because of the war in Ukraine, may not be the best way to handle the global energy crisis.\n\n\"We have a gas levy that increases the price,\" Lindner said in an interview published on Sunday. \"But we need a gas price brake that lowers the price.\"\n\nThe gas levy, which is due to come into force on October 1, became a political hot potato between members of Germany's coalition government as soon as it was first proposed by Robert Habeck, the country's energy minister and member of the Green party.\n\nDespite rising cost-of-living concerns for average German voters, the levy was designed to help profit-making energy companies, some of which have recorded blockbuster income amid rising global prices for natural gas. Estimates suggest an average German four-person household will pay €480 more a year to cover the planned levy.\n\nLindner raised concerns about whether such a surcharge would have the designed effect of helping to support those energy companies, often smaller outfits, that were struggling to pay rapidly increasing wholesale energy prices.\n\n\"It's less a question of law when it comes to the gas levy, but more and more of a question of economic reasoning,\" Lindner said. \"A gas price brake must help everyone in the economy quickly.\"",
    "Germany Considers Price Caps As Energy Crisis Worsens": "Germany looks to cap the prices of electricity and natural gas to help households and businesses reel from the soaring energy prices, The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, quoting German government officials.\n\nAccording to the Journal's sources, the plan for price caps in Europe’s biggest economy could become official in the coming weeks if the EU doesn’t agree on a price cap for the entire bloc.\n\nElsewhere in Europe, in the UK, for example, there is a price cap on energy bills that energy providers can charge to customers. The new UK has just announced that it would cap the annual energy bills for households at $2,700 (£2,500) for two years.\n\nUnlike the UK cap on prices, and a similar measure introduced in France, the cap in Germany would rather impose a levy on electricity-generating firms that charge more than a certain amount, yet to be determined, the Journal’s sources say. The money collected from the levy on producers would be later distributed to the operators providing energy to the end users, which would allow for lower power prices for end users.\n\nMany energy-intensive industries and companies in Germany are already feeling the pinch from the soaring natural gas and electricity prices. Some have curtailed production or stopped entire production lines, many others plan to do so.\n\nSigns are mounting that the German economy is slipping into recession, which will deepen as we head into the winter months amid the ongoing natural gas and energy crisis, Bundesbank, the central bank of Germany, said in its monthly report last week.\n\nAlso last week, the German government, energy giant Uniper, and Uniper’s majority shareholder, Finland-based firm Fortum, signed a deal under which Germany would nationalize its largest gas importer, in a move aimed at preventing a collapse of the German energy and gas suppliers.\n\nBy Michael Kern for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",
    "Russia and Germany to fall into recession as global economic outlooks darkens, OECD predicts": "Russia's invasion of Ukraine, soaring energy bills and record-breaking inflation have thrown the global economy into disarray, triggering an \"extended period of subdued growth,\" according to the latest forecast by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\n\nGermany, the EU's industrial powerhouse, is projected to fall into recession next year.\n\n\"The global growth outlook has darkened,\" the OECD said, in a report titled \"Paying the Price of War\"released on Monday morning.\n\nThe study paints a bleak picture of the world economy: business confidence, disposable incomes and household expenditure all plummet while the costs of fuels, food and transportation surge.\n\nInflation has become \"broad-based\" and will gradually ease throughout 2023, but still remain exceptionally high, as tighter financial conditions resulting from steep hikes in interest rates slowly yield results.\n\nFor Europe, the forecast is particularly gloomy in the event of a colder-than-usual winter: underground gas storage would be depleted and energy prices would soar, prompting shortages and industrial paralysis.\n\n\"This would push many countries into a full-year recession in 2023,\" the OECD says in the event of winter disruptions and enforced gas reductions.\n\nThe organisation also warns of the possibility that the sanctions against Russian oil, one of Moscow's top revenue sources, could prove \"more disruptive than anticipated.\"\n\nThe EU-wide embargo will take effect at the end of the year, taking about two million barrels per day of Russian crude and refined products off the market.\n\nIf Russia is unable to reroute these supplies to other regions, international prices will shoot up, adding even more pressure on the already-volatile energy supply chains.\n\n\"The global economy has lost momentum this year,\" the report notes. \"After bouncing back strongly from the COVID-19 pandemic, a return to a more normal economic situation appeared to be in prospect prior to Russia’s unprovoked, unjustifiable and illegal war of aggression against Ukraine.\"\n\nRussia and Germany head into recession\n\nOf all the countries analysed in the report, Russia is by far the worst-hit: the country, which has been hit by unprecedented Western sanctions, is projected to contract by 5.5% in 2022 and by 4.5% in 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, Germany will end this year with a 1.2% positive expansion but will decline by 0.7% next year. Recession fears are looming large over the country, which until early this year was a large consumer of Russian gas and is now scrambling to find alternative suppliers.\n\n\"The signs of a recession for the German economy are multiplying,\" Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, said last week.\n\nA recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of decline in gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nThe other European economies included in the OECD's study fare slightly better. France, Italy and Spain will see modest growth rates in 2023, at 0.6%, 0.4% and 1.5%, respectively, which means they could too fall into recession at one point but still end the year with moderate positive growth.\n\nThe eurozone will expand by 3.1% in 2022 and by a meagre 0.3% in 2023. Inflation will average 6.2% next year, over three times the 2% target desired by the European Central Bank.\n\nThese pessimistic estimations could deteriorate if the energy crisis takes a turn for the worse.\n\n\"Significant uncertainty surrounds the projections. More severe fuel shortages, especially for gas, could reduce growth in Europe by a further 1.25 percentage points in 2023,\" the OECD says.\n\nSpeaking before the European Parliament on Monday afternoon, ECB President Christine Lagarde also struck an ominous note and warned \"uncertainty remains high.\"\n\n\"The outlook is darkening,\" she told MEPs. \"We expect activity to slow substantially in the coming quarters.\"\n\nBeyond the bloc, the OECD expects the United States to grow by 0.5% next year, while the United Kingdom will post a 0% rate, meaning it will neither expand nor contract.\n\nJapan, Canada, Argentina, Brazil, South Africa and Mexico will all see limited rates, below the 2% mark.\n\nChina, a driving engine of the world economy that is pursuing a strict zero-Covid policy, will expand by 3.2% in 2022 and then speed up to 4.7% in 2023.\n\nOn the other hand, Saudi Arabia appears to enjoy an economic boom, \"buoyed by high energy prices.\" The oil-rich country is estimated to swell by almost 10% this year and 6% next year.\n\nOverall, the world economy will grow by 3% in 2022 and 2.2% in 2023, a downward revision compared to the previous OECD estimate.",

    "Germany takes baby from gay foster parents after Türkiye intervenes": "A Turkish-German family hailed Germany's decision to scrap the decision for adoption of their baby by gay parents after Türkiye intervened in the case following the family's opposition.\n\nIn May, the 10-month-old boy was handed over to Jugendamt, the German child welfare office, on the grounds that the mother, allegedly suffering from psychological problems was unfit for parenting and the infant was underdeveloped. Despite parents’ protest, the office did not retract the decision and the case was widely covered in Turkish media. The family, who lives in Duisburg, has said their child was given to a gay couple living near Cologne. They claimed that it was not an isolated case and that many other Turkish families had the same problem. A.K., the mother, has claimed she was allowed to see her son only once a month and called upon Turkish authorities to help her.\n\nA.K. said after the decision that Jugendamt apparently “felt the pressure” after media coverage of her case. “(Türkiye’s) Family and Social Policy attache’s office in Düsseldorf found us a lawyer and Minister of Family and Social Policy Derya Yanık personally took interest in the case,” she said, expressing her gratitude. A.K. stated that she also received many messages of support on social media. “We hope Jugendamt does not make another mistake and places my son at least with a Turkish family so he would not be deprived of the opportunity to learn Turkish culture and language,” she said.\n\nTurkish Ministry of Family and Social Policy had suggested two Turkish volunteer foster parents for E. earlier. The ministry has said in a recent statement that they hoped their request would be considered. The ministry also said that they attached importance that host countries considered lifestyle choices based on cultural and moral norms in such cases while assessing the foster care process for Turkish children.\n\nThe ministry, whose work was largely confined to Türkiye, had expanded its activities abroad in recent years. It seeks to promote the adoption of Turkish children in expat communities abroad by Turkish foster parents. Minister Derya Yanık has recently announced that some 200 Turkish children have been returned to their biological parents since 2015 in Germany thanks to the work of their attache offices in the European countries. First lady Emine Erdoğan also spearheads efforts to promote the foster parenting process among Turkish families abroad. Her campaign has seen 599 families volunteering to be foster parents in European countries.\n\nIn force since 1924, the Jugendamt was established to protect children but has become notorious for targeting the children of immigrant families. It gets paid by the German state according to the number of children it takes care of, and some foster parents manipulate childcare issues for their own economic interests. Such factors undermine the operation of the institution, which was originally founded with goodwill. Immigrant families in the country are scared to take their children to the hospital or psychologists because sharing their problems may mean they will inform the Jugendamt, which takes the custody of the children from their families. For instance, the child of a Turkish family with the surname of Toprak was forcibly taken when they took him to a hospital after he had chips stuck in his throat, while other families’ children were taken away because they allegedly spoiled their children and showed excessive attention. Germany currently hosts the largest number of Turkish immigrants, mostly descendants of \"guest workers.\"",

    "Striking health care workers in Germany: “Privatization was a big mistake!”": "A 24-hour warning strike Tuesday at the University Hospital of Giessen and Marburg (UKGM) has once again exposed the disastrous working conditions in Germany’s nursing profession. And this is not their first strike. In recent weeks, both nursing staff and clinic employees have struck four times at UKGM, causing significant cancellation of treatments and operations.\n\nIn Germany’s first privatized university hospital, the more than 9,000 employees are not only fighting against staff shortages, overwork and poor pay, but also against the threat that entire departments will be outsourced to subsidiaries and subcontractors and that apprentice nurses at the hospitals will no longer be taken on as staff after their training.\n\nHealth care staff from Marburg at the rally in Wiesbaden, September 21, 2022 (Photo WSWS)\n\nThe Asklepios group, which took over UKGM owner Rhön-Klinikum AG two years ago, is known for the rudest outsourcing and wage slashing at its clinics. The founder and main shareholder of Asklepios is multibillionaire Bernard Grosse Broermann, who in addition to other clinics, rehabilitation centers, etc., owns, among other real estate, a luxury hotel chain.\n\nRhön-Asklepios can rely on the cooperation of the state government in Hesse. In 2006, the government merged Justus Liebig University Hospital Giessen with Philipps University Hospital Marburg and then sold it to the Rhön Group. Since the takeover by Asklepios, the government has bound itself to participate in investments of up to half a billion euros in UKGM over the next 10 years.\n\nIn May, however, the Group unexpectedly terminated the corresponding “letter of intent” when it became clear that the war in Ukraine would drive up the costs of energy and new buildings. The state government immediately gave its assurance that it would share the additional financial burden. They would be “taken seriously” and “communal solutions would be found,” promised Science Minister Angela Dorn (Green Party).\n\nNevertheless, Rhön-Asklepios has refused to make any tangible promises regarding jobs, wages and the hiring of trainees. The 2017 collective employment agreement, which includes a complete ban on outsourcing and protection against dismissal, expires at the end of the year.\n\nIt is in this situation that the coalition government in Berlin is pushing ahead with its highly risky war policy. The German government is supplying Ukraine with ever more devastating weaponry in the fight against Russia, setting up a €100 billion “special fund,” not for care, but for the Bundeswehr (armed forces). And the working population, already struggling with inflation, must bear the cost.\n\nHospital workers are thus right to be worried and alarmed. On Tuesday, they showed once again the fighting potential that nursing staff collectively have and the support they can build on in the population. A case in point: a petition for the renationalization of the two university hospitals has received over 18,000 signatures.\n\nBut the warning strike also showed that this fight can no longer be left to the responsible service sector union, Verdi. It is—together with the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the Left Party (Die Linke)—the biggest obstacle to achieving job security, the prevention of war and the pandemic and the protection of quality health care in the future.\n\nWhat is required are independent rank-and-file committees, such as already exist among teachers and auto workers in the US, Sri Lanka and also among auto workers and nurses in Germany. They have the task of taking the struggle of care workers into their own hands and linking it with the struggle of other care workers and laborers. They do not focus on the profits of the corporations, but are dedicated to the health, safety and future of the workers.\n\nVerdi is systematically isolating the struggle at UKGM from other labor struggles in the nursing sector. Within the last year, workers at several other university hospitals have gone on strike for weeks at a time. After Berlin’s Charité and Vivantes struck, the university hospitals in North Rhine-Westphalia went on strike for 12 weeks before Verdi smothered the protest by selling the workers out. At Frankfurt University Hospital, too, employees are ready to strike because there is no relief whatsoever on the way. The same nursing crisis prevails everywhere.\n\nAnd the next wave of the coronavirus is already looming. The pandemic has brought previously existing grievances to a head and made them broadly visible. “It is not the strike, rather the normal state of affairs that endangers the patients,” a nurse in the Ruhr area succinctly put it. In Giessen in the fall and winter of 2020–2021, at the height of the pandemic wave, up to 110 COVID-19 sufferers were hospitalized at a given time, 45 of them in intensive care units, mostly on ventilators. The situation was similar in Marburg.\n\nSince then, the employees have been working at or near their limits for almost three years, many having quit their jobs. Some have become seriously ill themselves and some have died. While a new pandemic wave with devastating consequences is threatening in the fall, monkeypox is spreading worldwide and polio is returning.\n\nIn this inflamed situation, Verdi only ever stages useless whistle protests and 24-hour strikes. In association with the Left Party, the union is leading the workers around by the nose. On Tuesday, Verdi organized a rally in Wiesbaden in front of the state parliament building to give politicians a platform for their lies and excuses.\n\nNo more than 120 employees from the two clinics took part. Together with journalists, full-time trade unionists and politicians, they surrounded the stage on which the health experts from the Greens, the CDU, the SPD and the Left spoke one after another. Amid boos, Minister for Science and the Arts Angela Dorn (Greens), claimed that she, too, had “always been against privatization.”\n\nThe spokesman for the Hesse Left Party made it clear what goals are behind its campaign of “Return the hospital to public ownership!” He said, “Anyone who does not seriously consider this possibility is also a bit helpless when facing the corporation. We demand that there must be public money, state funds, only in exchange for public influence.”\n\nThat translates as: The demand is intended as leverage for the government’s negotiations with Rhön-Asklepios. It makes clear that the Left Party and Verdi do not themselves consider the “demand” for a return to public ownership—which they humbly address to the Christian Democrat-Green state government—to be in any way realistic.\n\nIn conversations with the WSWS, participants from the university hospitals made it clear that the workers are slowly losing patience with these protest and stalling tactics of the Verdi leaders, who themselves sit on all the supervisory boards.\n\nTwo operating room nurses from Marburg, employees of over 20 years, confirmed, “We have now reached the point where working conditions are worse than ever. … After privatization, we lost our Christmas bonus. But what is being expected of us today goes far beyond that, especially because the staffing situation is so strained.”\n\nA nurse responsible for training young nurses said, “We train a lot, we put our hearts and souls in it—clearly, since we are not getting extra time off for it. But the market is empty, and if conditions are that bad, young people won’t stay with us.” She added, “What I don’t understand is why we don’t actually strike together with the Frankfurt University Hospital?”\n\nFrido, who has worked in the transport service in Marburg for more than 11 years, said, “So far these warning strikes haven’t achieved anything at all. That’s my impression. The politicians don’t have any interest in talking to us. Privatization was a big mistake, but the government is not willing to correct the mistake.”\n\nHis colleague added, “We are at the bottom, the lowest link in the chain. The transport service has been continuously understaffed for a long time. Some of us are now doing the work of two, sometimes three people. But we are not compensated for it. Amongst ourselves, we’ve been talking about mileage pay, because some of us have health problems from constantly walking and being on our feet far too much. That has gotten a lot worse.”\n\nWhen asked about the suggestion to fight together with nurses in Frankfurt, the Ruhr area and Berlin, Frido said, “That would be better: you can only achieve something together. If we stay isolated, they won’t take us seriously at all. Why did we come here anyway?”\n\nThe World Socialist Web Site and SGP support the building of independent rank-and-file committees.

    "The Rising Risk Of Russian Oil Spills In Scandinavia": "The narrow waterway between Denmark and Sweden – a key chokepoint for oil supply from Russia’s western ports – will see the risk of oil spills increase when the EU sanctions against Russian oil exports by sea enter into force at the end of this year.\n\nThe UN agency International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the Danish maritime authorities strongly recommend the use of a specialized pilot on ships passing through the Danish straits with its many islands. Although not obligatory, the recommendation is widely followed by the industry, with pilots being used on 95% of all 196 oil tankers that crossed the Great Belt, the main channel in the straits, last month, per data from the Danish Maritime Authority cited by the Financial Times.\n\nHowever, the EU sanctions against Russian oil exports by sea would in theory ban the provision of EU maritime transportation services to vessels carrying Russian oil, including specialized pilots from Denmark to help navigate the Danish straits. This, if not addressed, could raise the risk of dangerous and environmentally-disastrous oil spills from ships that would not use a specialized pilot or try to go dark and circumvent the sanctions.\n\n“Failure to comply with the rules and recommendations of the IMO will not only pose an environmental risk to Danish territorial waters. It will also pose a risk to the safety of navigation and the crew members on board the ships,” the Danish Maritime Authority told FT.\n\nThe authority and the IMO “highly recommend” the usage of pilots on ships traveling through the Danish straits, but still, the Danish Maritime Authority told Bloomberg Opinion columnist Javier Blas earlier this month: “In conclusion, Denmark cannot prevent oil tankers from passing from the Baltic Sea to the high seas.”\n\nAnalysts believe that there could be a compromise or some sort of solution to this situation because it’s estimated that around 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) of Russian crude passes through the Danish straits from Russia’s Baltic Sea ports en route to the Atlantic.\n\nBy Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",
    "Putin is mobilizing. Germany and France are unlikely to step up": "John R. Deni is a research professor at the U.S. Army War College’s Strategic Studies Institute and a non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. He’s the author of “Coalition of the unWilling and unAble.”\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin’s recent decision to partially mobilize Russian reservists represents a significant escalation in his war against Ukraine.\n\nOver the coming weeks and months, this could inject as many as 300,000 additional Russian troops into the Kremlin’s war effort — and just as Ukraine has achieved some battlefield success. Increased Western assistance is now vital for Kyiv to leverage and expand its gains and build up defensive positions, before additional Russian forces enter the fight. But not all Western powers have been pulling their weight in this regard — especially Paris and Berlin.\n\nThe Franco-German engine has powered the European Union for over 70 years. Today, however, that engine has stalled in the face of the greatest challenge confronting European security since the end of World War II. The Continent’s most powerful economy and its most powerful military are failing to meet the moment. And, unfortunately, odds that either will change course within the timeframe necessary to help Kyiv achieve its objectives are low.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, top political leaders in both France and Germany appeared to recognize the scale of the crisis. French President Emmanuel Macron immediately highlighted the damage Russia had done to European peace and stability, noting that in its response, the West would “be without weakness” in the military, economic, and energy domains. Meanwhile, new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz declared Putin had destroyed the European security architecture, arguing that the Russian invasion had marked a turning point, and it was now time to support Ukraine to “the best of our ability.”\n\nSince those early days, though, the actions of Europe’s political dynamic duo have failed to match their own rhetoric. Germany has been dragging its feet on sending the kinds of military equipment other allies have been providing Ukraine for months. After promising to deliver multiple launch rocket systems, self-propelled howitzers and air defense systems, the glacial pace of delivery has cast doubt on Berlin’s commitment. Moreover, Germany’s sheer unwillingness to send heavy armored forces — like tanks and infantry fighting vehicles — has prompted criticism from Ukrainian leaders, who accuse Berlin of backtracking.\n\nMeanwhile, France has been willfully curtailing its assistance in hopes of playing the role of neutral arbiter when the shooting stops. Macron irreparably damaged his claim to European leadership when he called on Ukraine to avoid humiliating Putin, and from an operational perspective, while the country has provided offensive weapons to Ukraine, it has reportedly sent less than even Germany, and trained an extraordinarily small number of Ukrainian troops compared to others like the United Kingdom.\n\nClearly, these leading European countries have both failed to rise to the occasion — but for two very different reasons.\n\nFor over a half century, Germany has pursued a cooperative change-through-trade approach to Russia. Now, having finally woken up to Moscow’s zero-sum approach — and its corresponding disdain for cooperation with the West — Berlin is attempting to reverse its long-standing strategy. But change is never easy, especially in Germany, so the effort to overcome entrenched, conventional national security wisdom goes two steps forward, one step back.\n\nFor France, however, the dynamic in question isn’t change but the opposite — status quo.\n\nResidual illusions of French grandeur lie at the heart of Macron’s efforts to walk an elusive middle ground between the West and Russia. Across much of the Continent, France’s leading role in pursing European “strategic autonomy” in recent years has been seen as a thinly veiled attempt to resuscitate French greatness and promote the country’s own interests. However, in trying to position France as a practically minded, neutral arbiter between Ukraine and Russia, Macron has instead undermined Paris’s reputation as a defender of Western values and interests.\n\nUnfortunately, as this French pursuit of greatness continues to endure and 50 years of German foreign policy won’t be changed overnight, neither of these European powers is likely to play a leading role in helping Ukraine in the short run. This is particularly problematic at the moment, as Kyiv is eager to keep up the momentum after the serious battlefield success realized by its forces.\n\nAlthough the news from the Kharkiv region of northeastern Ukraine has been remarkably positive for Kyiv in recent days, there are still many reasons to think Russia is far from being knocked out of the conflict.\n\nFor one thing, Ukraine’s progress in the south — where it had begun shifting resources from Kharkiv — remains slow and arduous. Additionally, Moscow retains the ability to conduct precision long-range strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure. Most importantly, though, Russia still holds both qualitative and quantitative military advantages over Ukraine in terms of both manpower and equipment.\n\nFor all these reasons — especially given Putin’s partial mobilization — the war will most likely continue to unfold over the coming months, if not years. Ukraine is unlikely to remain in the fight without significant long-term Western aid, precision weaponry in particular, which they have already been using to good effect, targeting Russian supply lines and logistics. But they will need more — particularly if outmatched in troop numbers later this year.\n\nThe United States, the U.K., Poland, and other allies are all currently providing substantial training, equipment, expertise and intelligence. And in response to Putin’s mobilization, both France and Germany have an opportunity to do so as well — but whether and when they will fulfill their potential remains to be seen.",
    "Germany loses another glacier as warm temps melt Alpine ice": "Germany lost one of its few remaining glaciers this summer as exceedingly warm weather ate away Alpine ice at a faster pace than feared, a scientific report released on Monday showed.\n\nThe Bavarian Academy of Sciences said the state's Southern Schneeferner had lost its official status as a glacier due to rapid melting of its once sprawling ice sheet.\n\n\"The Schneeferner's ice thickness shrank significantly in large swathes and in most places no longer measures even 2 meters (6.5 feet),\" the academy said in its latest findings.\n\nIt said even the thickest spot was now diminished to less than 6 meters compared to around 10 meters in 2018. The surface area of the glacier halved during the same period to about one hectare.\n\n\"That leads us to conclude that the remaining ice will completely melt away in the next one to two years,\" the academy said.\n\nIt said that the dramatic shrinkage meant that the periodic measurements carried out by the academy since 1892 would now be suspended.\n\nThe loss means Germany has only four remaining glaciers: Northern Schneeferner and Hoellentalferner on its highest mountain, the Zugspitze, and Blaueis and Watzmann in the Berchtesgaden Alps.\n\nRapid glacier melt in the Alps and elsewhere, which experts say is being driven by climate change, has been increasingly closely monitored since the early 2000s.\n\nBavaria's Environment Ministry said last year in a bombshell report that Germany could lose its last glaciers within the decade as climate change gathered pace.\n\nScientists had previously estimated the glaciers would be around until the middle of the century.\n\nA global study released in April 2021 found nearly all the world's glaciers are losing mass at an ever-increasing pace, contributing to more than a fifth of global sea level rise this century.",
    "Refugees: German cities are reaching their limits": "A bitter wind blows across the empty sports fields on the road out of Herzogenrath-Merkstein, a small community in the far west of Germany near Aachen. A few brown leaves whirl over the green grass of the soccer field; the red-colored sand of the running track is wet. On the once-white plaster of the gymnasium, someone has written \"SVS Merkstein,\" the name of the local sports club, in black paint.\n\nBut no sports activities are taking place here at the moment. Instead, the hall is being used to house refugees from the war in Ukraine. In early August, partitions were used to set up temporary accommodation for 80 people. Now the space is full — as are all the other accommodation facilities for refugees in Herzogenrath.\n\nPastor Frank Ungerathen and his team help the refugees in the small community of Herzogenrath\n\nAbout a kilometer down the road from the hall, the refugee advice team sits together for a meeting at the Protestant parish of Lydia. Pastor Frank Ungerathen has just told his colleagues that a second gymnasium will be converted this week. He learned this from the city's social welfare office, which is responsible for taking in and caring for the refugees.\n\nHe and his team had hoped that the situation would not again reach the point it did during the refugee crisis of 2015/2016, when people also had to be accommodated in gym halls and even tents. But there is simply no more housing available in the small city of about 50,000 residents.\n\n\"The housing market has totally dried up,\" said Mahkameh Robatian, who leads the advice center. Private offers to take in refugees are also rare. \"The high prices of gas and electricity mean that people often decline because it becomes too expensive for them,\" said volunteer Olga Meier.\n\nIn any refugee accommodation in Aachen, at least two people share a bedroom\n\nHelpers overwhelmed\n\nSince Russia invaded Ukraine and the first refugees from the war arrived in Germany, the advice center has been working nonstop. Its staff hold talks, make phone calls to authorities, help fill out forms, organize language courses, look for apartments and arrange cooking classes and meetings over coffee and cake. They encourage, advise, comfort and, when necessary, also look after children.\n\nA city like Herzogenrath normally received about 50 to 60 new refugees per year, estimated the pastor. \"Now, 400 war refugees from Ukraine arrived in the space of three months — and we currently have 530,\" he said. In addition, about 850 people who fled from 20 other countries have also arrived. \"Some have found jobs in the meantime, many have not — and the need for integration does not stop there.\" The municipality cannot cope with this on its own.\n\nIn Aachen, 20 kilometers (12 miles) away, the situation looks no better. At the start of August, Mayor Sibylle Keupen pulled the emergency brake and announced that the city would not accept any more war refugees or asylum-seekers for the time being. All emergency accommodation centers were full, including eight gym halls.\n\nAachen Mayor Sibylle Keupen has said many refugees are here to stay, and need permanent accommodation\n\nMost of the more than 4,000 Ukrainian refugees who are registered in Aachen and receive financial support have found accommodation privately. This is also because Aachen already had a relatively large Ukrainian community before the war.\n\nIt is mostly people from African countries, along with a few Syrians and a handful of Ukrainians, who live in a \"container village\" made of prefabricated buildings that were set up on a former sports ground in the city's south in 2016. The small rooms, each with their own cooking facilities, showers and toilets, are in hot demand because they offer privacy. Up to 120 people can live there, but a third of the containers are currently leaking and therefore uninhabitable. Attempts are underway to repair them.\n\nThe city authorities in Aachen are working flat out to convert vacant commercial properties into accommodation. The plan is that the refugees should have moved out of the gyms in a few months, by the end of autumn.\n\nA Dutch company sets up makeshift accommodation to house refugees\n\nLocal authorities feel abandoned\n\n\"We are now in a situation where we realize this war will probably go on for a long time yet — the people will stay here, and they need something other than a sports hall,\" said Keupen. \"These are families, these are different ethnic groups, different age groups, who all clash together there — that is also an explosive social force that we must moderate. That is very difficult if we do not have more small-scale accommodation options.\"\n\nThe mayor supports the demand from the German Association of Towns and Municipalities, which represent the interests of city and district authorities, for a refugee summit. The federal government must better control the distribution of people across the country, as well as step in financially, she believes.\n\nUkrainian children go to school in Germany\n\n\"We need an orderly system to really provide people with — and this is the important thing for me — not just a roof over their head and a bed, but more. They need a place at school, or day care: they also need psychosocial care, especially when it comes to families and children who are dealing with war-related trauma,\" she said.\n\nThese are all things that throughout Germany are just as hard to come by as an available apartment — for which the refugees are competing with the rest of the population.\n\n\"Most landlords say no straight away, or hang up when they hear about refugees,\" said Michaela Lee, who is responsible for administration at the refugee help center in Herzogenrath.\n\n\"I am always so glad when I manage to find an apartment for a refugee,\" she added. \"Or an apprenticeship, after I have helped write hundreds of applications.\" That is her motivation.\n\nThis article was originally written in German\n\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

    "Germany still confident about World Cup hopes despite lean run of form": "A proud footballing nation on a lean run of just one win in six games. A humiliating defeat at home against Hungary. And above all, a sense of stasis and frustration, a lack of creativity, the suspicion that for all the talent and trophies in this team, it remains considerably less than the sum of its parts.\n\nGermany and England may share a common predicament, but as they prepare to meet on Monday night only one of these nations is currently racked by existential crisis. And curiously, it’s not the one that has bombed out of its last two international tournaments.\n\nAs Germany slipped to defeat in Leipzig on Friday night, the mood was defined more by indifference than insurrection. The few pockets of boos were drowned out by the sizeable Hungarian contingent, celebrating their first competitive win over Germany since 1985. Nobody was calling for Hansi Flick’s head on a platter. Nobody was writing off the World Cup. Instead, an implacable calm reigned, a sense that whatever their travails, this team will inevitably come good when it matters. “The coach has it under control,” Joshua Kimmich insisted.\n\nNot that there wasn’t a certain disgruntlement at the defeat, Germany’s first under Flick. It took 37 minutes to register a shot on target, and even if they improved later on, chances remained cherishably rare. “The first half was just shit,” admitted Jonas Hofmann with impressive bluntness. Flick, for his part, was prepared to take his share of the blame for a bold tactical experiment in which Hoffman – normally an attacking midfielder – played at right-back. “It didn’t work that well,” Flick conceded.\n\nBut the most telling comment of all came from the stand-in captain Thomas Müller. “You notice that many of us are not going through the easiest phase at our club,” the veteran forward said. “We did not bring our power on to the pitch.” All of which essentially confirmed what many outside the camp have long suspected: that when Bayern Munich sneezes, Germany gets a cold.\n\nWere he minded to do so, Flick could draw his entire front six from the current champions: Müller, Serge Gnabry, Leroy Sané and Jamal Musiala in the forward positions, Kimmich and Leon Goretzka behind them, with Manuel Neuer in goal. In practice Musiala is more likely to be an impact substitute. Neuer and Goretzka were absent on Friday with Covid issues. But the Bayern influence is indelible, not least in the form of Flick himself, who coached the club to their most recent Champions League in 2020.\n\nThomas Müller was part of the Germany side that lost in the last 16 to England at Euro 2020 Photograph: Michael Sohn/AP\n\nMüller’s words were the first real admission of what many outside the camp have long suspected: that the problems at Bayern under Julian Nagelsmann, where the champions have gone four games without a win, are beginning to bleed into the national team. The lack of a focal point up front. The inability of wingers Sané and Gnabry to hit a consistent run of form. A certain slowness in the build-up. An imbalance between defence and attack, with Kimmich often the man caught out.\n\nAnd with just two months until Germany begin their World Cup campaign against Japan, perhaps the most pressing question remains unanswered: who starts up front? Timo Werner? Kai Havertz? Nobody? Werner is currently the man in possession – Flick is a fan of his speed, his work-rate and aggression off the ball – but has scored in just one of his last six games. Lukas Nmecha of Wolfsburg is highly rated but not (yet) a consistent scoring threat. Which is why there is increasing speculation that there may still be time for a late bolter such as Niclas Füllkrug of Werder Bremen or Nils Petersen at Freiburg to make the plane.\n\nNone of which, curiously enough, seems to have made the slightest dent in Germany’s confidence. There appears to be a broad assumption that once the minor issues have been tweaked and the tournament mentality kicks in, Germany will be fine. “They are all competitive players, all winners,” trilled Oliver Bierhoff, now the team director at the German FA. Flick was of a similar mind: “Maybe the defeat came at the right time, rather than at the World Cup,” he observed.\n\nThere is a stark contrast here to England’s wall of wailing, and perhaps it is one that speaks to the respective footballing maturity of these two nations. In England we remain essentially incapable of analysing the national team without resorting to the register of crisis, hyperbole and ultimacy: he’s done, she’s finished, they’ll never win a thing, it’s coming home.\n\nImagine if it were Southgate who had failed to reach the quarter-finals in 2018 and 2021, who had been drawn in a group with Spain, who still didn’t have a recognised striker, who was dangerously beholden to a single struggling club. By contrast, you sense Germany are perfectly happy to leave the worrying to others.",
    "The politics of Germany’s Zeitenwende": "Germany’s Zeitenwende still has a long way to go Karl-Peter Schwarz\n\nAn economic downturn could threaten support for reducing a trifecta of dependencies: energy imports from Russia, exports to China and the United States for security.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Angela Merkel arrive for a press conference on August 20, 2021, in Moscow. In 2021, the last of Ms. Merkel’s 16 years as chancellor, Germany imported 55 percent of its natural gas from Russia. In the wake of Russia’s war in Ukraine and the Kremlin’s use of energy as a political weapon, Berlin wants to drastically reduce this dependency. © Getty Images\n\n× In a nutshell Germany faces difficulties undoing the mistakes of the Merkel-Schroeder eras\n\nDefense spending, despite increases, remains short of NATO’s 2 percent goal\n\nHigher energy prices may weaken the public’s willingness to support Ukraine\n\nChancellor Olaf Scholz’s speech in the Bundestag on February 27, 2022, was a watershed event in German history.\n\nMr. Scholz spoke of a “turning point” – Zeitenwende in German – triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “The world after that is no longer the same as the world before,” the German leader said. The statement gave the impression that Germany had suddenly become aware of its responsibilities. From now on, the nation of 83 million people, with Europe’s largest economy, would no longer entrust its security to the United States alone, its energy supply to Russia and its economic growth to exports to China.\n\nThis turnaround is primarily about German-Russian relations, the need to strengthen defense capability and deterrence, and secure energy supplies. Mr. Scholz announced he would provide the Bundeswehr with a credit-financed special fund of 100 billion euros. That is a significant amount, but to meet the expectation that NATO members invest at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product (GDP) in defense, an additional 25 billion euros would have to be spent annually, adjusted for inflation.\n\nMajor overhaul needed\n\nThe change required is enormous. In 1989, Germany invested 2.7 percent of its gross domestic product in national security, and by 2014, it was only 1.1 percent. Only since 2017 has the share risen again – in 2021, it was 1.5 percent. However, 41 percent of this was spent on personnel and pension entitlements. In France, 26.5 percent of defense funds go to equipment; in Germany, only 16.87 percent do. On the day of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Bundeswehr Inspector Lieutenant General Alfons Mais, the highest-ranking officer of the German Army, said that the army had been severely weakened after years of austerity and is no more up to the task.\n\nUnder Mr. Scholz’s predecessors, Gerhard Schroeder (1998-2005) and Angela Merkel (2005-2021), German foreign and security policy assumed that the nation was surrounded only by friends. This misjudgment led to a security policy recklessness that manifested itself in the neglect of the Bundeswehr. When the U.S., the United Kingdom, Poland and other NATO partners supplied Ukraine with heavy weapons, the Bundeswehr was already in such a deplorable state that it could not comply with the Ukrainian government’s requests.\n\nHowever, national security is only one of the many ruins Ms. Merkel has left to the Scholz government. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s threat to cut off gas supplies would not be nearly as effective if Germany had not done everything it could to make itself economically blackmailable. Udo Di Fabio, a former judge with the Constitutional Court, delivered a devastating verdict on German energy policy:\n\nNo country with a keen sense of the mechanics of foreign power relations would have actively promoted or passively accepted such a massive energy dependence on Russia as Germany under chancellors Schroeder and Merkel. Criticism from the U.S. of projects such as Nord Stream 2 was politely forbidden, criticism from the Baltic states was not taken seriously. The Federal Republic pursued an almost romantic energy policy.\n\n× Facts & figures Germany’s 3 major vulnerabilities In trade, defense and energy, Germany has been highly reliant on three nations – China, the United States and Russia, respectively. But the government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz has promised to overhaul Germany’s natural security strategy to reduce dependencies in each area. (Sources: International Energy Agency, Federal Statistical Office of Germany, Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.) © GIS\n\nSelf-inflicted wounds\n\nReduced Russian oil and gas supplies are hitting Germany particularly hard today because rising global demand is accompanied by a politically engineered shortage that began long before the sanctions against Russia. Germany has been suffering from the consequences of self-inflicted economic wounds that have dominated energy policy since Ms. Merkel embraced the positions of the Greens.\n\nIn 2011, she used the destruction of four reactor units in Fukushima, caused by an earthquake and a tidal wave, as a pretext to order Germany’s withdrawal from the peaceful use of nuclear energy. The nuclear and coal-fired power plants were gradually shut down, and domestic gas extraction by fracking was dispensed with, citing possible environmental damage.\n\nAnother concession with which the chancellor drew the left-wing opposition to her side was the opening of borders during the migration crisis of 2015-2016. Compared to the Greens, the party Die Linke and the left wing of the Social Democrats, she thus distinguished herself as an ally in the “fight against the right.” The informal party coalition on which the chancellor relied ranged from the left-wing fringe to the Greens to deep into the CDU, which lost its conservative and Christian-democratic brand core.\n\nRevising wrong decisions that have accumulated over five legislative periods would overwhelm any government, even if the parties supporting it had not been involved in setting those misguided policies.\n\nToday, German parties have to say goodbye to a series of apparent certainties that have been questioned for more than 20 years only on the fringes of the party spectrum branded as populist. To revise wrong decisions that have accumulated over five legislative periods would overwhelm any government, even if the parties supporting it had not been involved in setting those misguided policies.\n\nThe three parties in the Scholz government had helped shape Germany during these two decades. The Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the Greens governed under Mr. Schroeder of the SPD from 1998 to 2005. Twice, from 2005 to 2009 and 2013 to 2021, the SPD belonged to a grand coalition with the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) under Ms. Merkel. The Free Democratic Party (FDP) had been Ms. Merkel’s junior partner in the black-yellow coalition from 2009 to 2013. All three parties of the “traffic light” coalition and the CDU, as the largest opposition party, played a part in the drama that turned the economically strong and politically self-confident Germany of Helmut Kohl (who served from 1982-1998) into a less reliable and crisis-prone partner for the Western world.\n\nThe conditions supporting the German export industry have deteriorated significantly following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war.\n\nRectifying misguided policies\n\nThe responsibility for the mistakes and omissions of the Merkel era lies first and foremost with the CDU. Friedrich Merz, who emerged from the turmoil as Ms. Merkel’s successor as the new CDU chairman, had been the chancellor’s most prominent opponent within the party for years. So, it was not too difficult for him to support the turnaround that Mr. Scholz announced in the Bundestag. To prevent conflicts in the party, however, he has so far avoided criticizing the former chancellor, who had shaped the profile of the CDU and still enjoys significant support in it. To stand openly against them would be understood as a concession by the new CDU chairman to the Alternative for Germany (AfD), the only party in the Bundestag to have opposed them on almost all issues.\n\nMs. Merkel’s popularity was evident in a poll conducted three weeks before the federal election in September 2021. In it, 80 percent of those surveyed approved of her job. That judgment reflects the economic upswing experienced by Germany during her chancellorship.\n\nRobust German growth had been the result of an exceptionally favorable combination of several factors, led by cheap energy from Russia. But other factors contributed to the boom times: an upswing in the global economy, particularly from rising demand in China, the wage restraint of German workers and the weak external value of the euro. The higher tax revenues financed the expansion of the welfare state, the energy transition and a climate policy that was executed without regard for the industry’s concerns.\n\nMeanwhile, the conditions supporting the German export industry have deteriorated significantly following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war. The International Monetary Fund revised downward its growth forecasts for 2022 and 2023. In May 2022, it estimated Germany’s 2022 growth at around 2 percent; by July, the projection was only 1.2 percent. Numerous small and medium-sized enterprises, especially in the tourism and gastronomy sectors, have had to close due to the Covid lockdowns. It is feared that many companies will not survive the increased energy prices and the reduction of gas supplies in autumn and winter.\n\nTo relieve consumers, the government has thus far made 30 billion euros available. On September 4, the German chancellor announced an additional 65 billion-euro relief package, with Mr. Scholz finally acknowledging the obvious: “Russia is no longer a reliable supplier of energy.” It represents a sharp departure from the failed strategy of “change through trade.”\n\nThe situation has kept changing dramatically. On September 5, the German government even agreed to continue operating until April 2023 two of the remaining three nuclear power plants that had been scheduled to close at the end of the year. Also on that day, the Kremlin said it is stopping gas supplies to Europe through Nord Stream until Western sanctions are lifted against Russia.\n\nSee also\n\nWill support for sanctions hold?\n\nNevertheless, the party Die Linke and the AfD are planning a “hot autumn” for the government. There were violent protests when Chancellor Scholz wanted to explain the federal government’s plans at a citizens’ meeting in Neuruppin on August 18. Unlike Ms. Merkel, who largely eluded debate, Mr. Scholz strives to establish contact with the citizens. However, he lacks charisma, and he keeps as many options open as possible in his statements. The chancellor is wary of the tense relations in the coalition with the Greens and the FDP and tries not to provoke the left in his own party, whose influence has increased after the Bundestag election.\n\nMeanwhile, the approval ratings of the traffic light coalition are falling. In a survey at the beginning of August 2022, only 14 percent of respondents said they were “very satisfied” with the government’s work, while 37 percent said they were “very dissatisfied.” Satisfaction with the chancellor has also slumped. Recent polls also show his SPD party losing popularity as the Greens gain.\n\nOpposition to supporting Ukraine is particularly strong in the SPD. Not only Mr. Schroeder but Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and numerous other Social Democrats are known for their pro-Russian stance, which was not questioned in the party until after the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. If the energy crisis in winter leads to mass social protests, the pressure on the government to lift or at least mitigate the sanctions against Russia is likely to increase, as demanded by Die Linke and the AfD.\n\nIn the CDU, too, more voices want to force a change of course. The spokesman of this current movement is Saxon Prime Minister Michael Kretschmer, who is pushing for quick negotiations to “freeze” the war because sufficient Russian gas flows in the coming years are essential to keep social peace in Germany. There has been a debate even in the FDP since Wolfgang Kubicki, vice president of the Bundestag, proposed activating the Nord Stream 2 pipeline as soon as possible. The FDP chairman Christian Lindner and numerous other politicians of the party have spoken out vehemently against it.\n\nOnly the Greens have thus far resisted the temptation to question the turnaround in Russia policy announced by Mr. Scholz in the Bundestag. Among the German parties, only they had spoken out against Nord Stream 2 from the outset. In the German Bundestag, the Greens campaigned even more than the CDU and FDP to support Ukraine against Russia with the supply of heavy weapons.",
    "How will Germany line up at the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022?": "Germany go in search of equalling five-time world champions Brazil as record FIFA World Cup winners when they land in Qatar this winter, but who will be taking the field when their campaign gets underway and how will Hansi Flick be setting out his stall?\n\nFollowing a two-year spell at Bayern Munich in which Flick collected two Bundesliga titles, DFB Cup, UEFA Super Cup, FIFA Club World Cup and UEFA Champions League trophies, the 57-year-old took his country's reins in August last year.\n\nTypically, of a coach who led Bayern to an unprecedented sextuple, Flick took to international duty in fine fashion.\n\nPredecessor Joachim Löw finished his tenure with two losses, a defeat and just one win as Germany exited the UEFA Euro 2020 championships at the last-16 stage to old foes England.\n\nOne of Flick's first decisions was to immediately reinstate Thomas Müller to his side and the fresh face of a new coach saw the team hoover up eight successive victories. Now with 14 games under their belt, the former shopkeeper's side still boast an impressive run of results (W9, D4, L1) and they again look a force to be reckoned with.\n\nWatch: Tireless Thomas Müller\n\nIt shouldn't come as a surprise when you consider that Flick served as Löw's assistant when Germany claimed a fourth world title in 2014.\n\nSince taking the big job, the national team have scored in 13 of those 14 matches and hit four or more goals on six occasions, including a 9-0 demolition of Liechtenstein as Germany made light work of qualification for Qatar.\n\nOption 1\n\nAs was the case during his spell in the Bayern hotseat, Flick has settled on a 4-3-2-1 formation for all but one of his games in charge, instead opting for a 3-4-2-1 in the 1-1 draw with England in June.\n\nInterestingly, versatile defender Thilo Kehrer has started most frequently under Flick, with the former Schalke man beginning on the right and left of Germany's defence four times apiece and at centre-half in his three other starts.\n\nHe's clearly a player trusted by his coach and his versatility will be a major asset in tournament football, but Kehrer is most likely to start from the bench when Germany are at full strength.\n\n- /\n\nWant more Bundesliga Action?

I understand that I can withdraw my consent(s) at any time. * Required * Required\n\nFar more certain is the place of captain Manuel Neuer, who will again be his country's No.1 going into what will be the 36-year-old's fourth World Cup.\n\nNeuer has started between the sticks in nine of Flick's 14-game tenure, just behind clubmates Joshua Kimmich and Leroy Sane, as well as RB Leipzig frontman Timo Werner, in the ranks for most frequently in Flick’s starting XI.\n\nAntonio Rüdiger has emerged as the first-choice pick at centre-back, leaving Borussia Dortmund duo Nico Schlotterbeck and Niklas Süle to jostle for the place alongside him, while Jonas Hofmann has been a regular selection at right-back, largely for his attacking instincts to provide extra width. On the opposite flank, Leipzig left-back David Raum is in pole position ahead of Robin Gosens and Christian Günter.\n\nIn front of them, Kimmich has been partnered in equal amounts by Leon Goretzka and Ilkay Gündogan, and it appears a straight shootout between the latter two as to who lines up alongside Bayern's No. 6.\n\nFlick's tenure so far has suggested that Müller and Sane are fairly certain of starting berths, but there is such fierce competition for places that the attacking spots remain up in the air.\n\nFormer Bayer Leverkusen starlet Kai Havertz hasn't yet nailed down a spot of his own but his ability to play anywhere in attack, coupled with the fact he is naturally left-footed, could help his cause.\n\nWatch: The best of Manuel Neuer\n\nSerge Gnabry scored four times in Flick's first four matches but has started just two of Germany's last nine.\n\nConsidering Gnabry's previous success under Flick for club and country, as well as his record of a goal approximately every 125 minutes in international football, and his more natural ability to operate from the flanks, you would imagine he and Sane would line-up either side of Müller in an all-Bayern supporting cast.\n\nIf fellow Bayern attacker Jamal Musiala continues his fine early season form, however, he could well get the nod from Flick, although Gnabry’s greater experience is likely to be valued highly at the World Cup, with Musiala set for a role as an impact substitute.\n\nGnabry has also operated through the middle for his country, but it looks far more likely that Werner and Havertz will vie for the opportunity to lead the line. On current evidence, Werner's movement off the ball and lighting pace look the better fit.\n\nWatch: Timo Werner - RB Leipzig take II\n\nOption 2\n\nGermany's strength in depth is remarkable, with world-class options in reserve at every station on the pitch.\n\nBarcelona custodian Marc-Andre ter Stegen has filled in for Neuer when the captain hasn't been present, and the long-standing back-up will surely be next in the pecking order in Qatar, his shot-stopping qualities and ability with the ball at his feet making him a reliable alternative.\n\nWith Hofmann having elbowed his way into the starting XI at right-back, West Ham’s Kehrer is next in line on the right of defence. The sheer number of times he has been picked by Flick indicating a place on the plane is virtually assured.\n\nFlick named Süle as a guaranteed starter against England in the Nations League at the end of September in Rüdiger’s absence, indicating that he will be among the first XI at the World Cup. If the 57-year-old’s tenure at Bayern is anything to go by, he likes to keep a settled team and avoid too much rotation in terms of personnel and formation, so a Rüdiger-Süle axis looks to be Germany’s centre-back duo in November.\n\n- /\n\nConsequently, Schlotterbeck is first in line as a replacement, alongside Freiburg’s Matthias Ginter, whom Flick recently praised for being “in very good shape”. At left-back, Gosens looks slightly ahead of Günter for the first reserve berth, although that could all change over the coming weeks with Gosens’ playing time limited at Inter, while Günter continues to shine for Freiburg in the Bundesliga and Europa League.\n\nGoretzka has struggled with injury in the early part of 2022/23 but is a high-calibre alternative for central midfield, with Wolfsburg’s Maximilian Arnold a reliable option – and a left-footer to boot, although he is slightly more defensive-minded.\n\nOnce again it is in the attacking third that Flick is really spoiled for choice. He singled out Musiala for praise ahead of the Nations League tie with England, hailing the 19-year-old’s development over the last couple of years.\n\n“From the first time he trained with the first team at Bayern you could see how talented he was,” the tactician said. “His progress has been great and he is brilliant in tight spaces. He’s got a good feeling for space and is a really good dribbler. He’s very good defensively and wins a lot of balls for us. I’m happy he plays for Germany.”\n\nWatch: All of Musiala's Bundesliga goals so far in 2022/23\n\nMusiala has usually been the first attacking substitute under Flick, although Kai Havertz and Marco Reus will likely have something to say about that in Qatar. The latter, in particular, will be raring to go as he is currently on the sidelines for a few weeks with an injury sustained against Schalke on Matchday 7. And we all remember how he missed the 2014 triumph due to an injury right before heading to Brazil.\n\nLukas Nmecha offers a different threat to Werner up front. Whereas the Leipzig forward is a blur of pace and movement, his Wolfsburg counterpart brings greater physicality at 6’1” and is equally lethal with either foot: last season he scored three with his left, three with his right and two headers for the Wolves.\n\nOption 3\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Flick has only employed a 3-4-2-1 formation once in his 14 games at the helm, but he is a pragmatist unafraid to change if necessary.\n\nIn this variation, Schlotterbeck’s composure in possession and ability to play accurate, raking diagonal balls from the back would fast-track him into the starting XI. Hofmann and Raum would be given license to explore the final third of the pitch, albeit with the brief to stay wide and drag deep-lying opposition defenders out of position in the absence of a more traditional winger like Sane or Gnabry.\n\nGündogan would play higher up than Kimmich to overload the centre alongside Müller and Musiala, who probe on the edge of the area looking for gaps to exploit Werner’s speed.\n\n- /\n\nOption 4\n\nAll of which leaves us with a purely hypothetical fourth option. Injuries to any of the above would open the door to a number of squad regulars, who could form an imposing side in their own right.\n\nKevin Trapp’s star rose in the wake of Eintracht Frankfurt’s Europa League triumph in May, Lukas Klostermann and Jonathan Tah have plenty of experience at the highest level for Leipzig and Leverkusen respectively, while former Bochum defender Armel Bella-Kotchap has impressed since his summer move to Southampton and recently received his first senior call-up.\n\nFurther forward in central midfield, Florian Neuhaus and Anton Stach are experienced Bundesliga pros, if slightly green at international level, while the likes of Julian Brandt, Julian Draxler and Karim Adeyemi would normally be the first names on the teamsheet in almost any other national side.\n\n- /\n\nFor Flick the only remaining question would be who to take as a third striker? Niclas Füllkrug has been consistently good for Werder Bremen over the past 18 months and is currently the leading German scorer in the Bundesliga. His aerial threat should not be overlooked, particularly if the side are chasing the game late on.\n\nIt is perhaps a coin toss between him and Dortmund teenager Youssoufa Moukoko. While still raw, he has pace to burn and former BVB teammate Erling Haaland once even claimed he was better than him at the same age. He would be familiar with the Dortmund contingent already in the squad but a handy wildcard to have nonetheless: attacking players with the ability to produce a moment of magic from nothing are highly prized commodities.",
    "Germany Announces €10 Million in New, Additional Funding to Support Education Cannot Wait’s Education Response in Ukraine, Bringing Total Contributions to €330 Million - Ukraine": "24 September 2022\n\nNEW YORK/BERLIN\n\nIt is our common responsibility to ensure that all children and youth have access to quality education.’ – Svenja Schulze, Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany\n\nRussia’s war in Ukraine has severely impacted access to education for approximately 7 million children. In response to that, the Government of Germany announced today €10 million in new, additional funding to Education Cannot Wait at the Global Citizen Festival.\n\nGermany is the largest donor to Education Cannot Wait, the United Nations global fund for education in emergencies and protracted crises, with almost €330 million in total funding to date.\n\n“The international community urgently needs to increase its investments in education. Global Citizens, thank you for raising your voices to call for more support for Education Cannot Wait, so that all young people everywhere in the world will have access to quality education: this will enable us to end extreme poverty - now,\" stated Svenja Schulze, Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany.\n\n“Thank you, Germany! Your inspiring leadership and strong support has taken Education Cannot Wait to the next level. Education is the most crucial investment to make today, to build a more equal, prosperous and peaceful future for all! Through global and local partnerships, we can deliver on our promise of quality education for crisis-affected children and youth, ensuring that no one is left behind,” said Yasmine Sherif, Director of Education Cannot Wait.\n\nThe new contribution connects to Education Cannot Wait’s First Emergency Response grants in Ukraine. The current investments are managed by Save the Children and UNICEF and focus on protecting the wellbeing of Ukraine’s conflict-affected girls and boys, while also ensuring continuous access to education and psychosocial support.\n\nSchools across Ukraine have been the target of repeated attacks throughout the seven-month war. Recent government reports indicate that as many as 2,300 educational institutions had been hit, and over 280 have been destroyed. Millions of refugees have fled into neighboring countries, straining resources, ripping families apart, and denying children and adolescents to their inherent human right to 12 years of quality education.\n\nWith the war in Ukraine, massive displacement in Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and Asia, the compounding impacts of the climate crisis, and global economic uncertainty, the world is facing a worsening global education crisis.\n\nShocking new analysis from ECW indicates that 222 million crisis-impacted girls and boys are in need of urgent education support – up from previous estimates of 75 million in 2016.\n\nIn response to the global education crisis, ECW launched its Case for Investment and 2023-2026 Strategic Plan during this year’s United Nations General Assembly. To make good on promises outlined in the Sustainable Development Goals (especially SDG4 – Education For All), Safe Schools Declaration and other international accords, the Fund is rallying donors and strategic partners to mobilize US$1.5 billion in funding to reach at least 20 million crisis-impacted children and adolescents over the next four years through its #222MillionDreams campaign.\n\nEducation Cannot Wait’s High-Level Financing Conference will take place in Geneva in February 2023. Hosted by Switzerland and Education Cannot Wait – and co-convened by Germany, Niger, Norway and South Sudan – through the 222 Million Dreams campaign, the conference calls on government donors, private sector, foundations and high-net-worth individuals to turn commitments into action by making substantive funding contributions to ECW.\n\nNote to Editors\n\nAbout Education Cannot Wait (ECW):\n\nEducation Cannot Wait (ECW) is the United Nations global fund for education in emergencies and protracted crises. We support quality education outcomes for refugee, internally displaced and other crisis-affected girls and boys, so no one is left behind. ECW works through the multilateral system to both increase the speed of responses in crises and connect immediate relief and longer-term interventions through multi-year programming. ECW works in close partnership with governments, public and private donors, UN agencies, civil society organizations, and other humanitarian and development aid actors to increase efficiencies and end siloed responses. ECW urgently appeals to public and private sector donors for expanded support to reach even more vulnerable children and youth. The Education Cannot Wait High-Level Financing Conference, co-hosted by ECW and Switzerland, and co-convened with Germany, Niger, Norway and South Sudan, will take place February 16-17, 2023, in Geneva.\n\nOn Twitter, please follow: @EduCannotWait, @YasmineSherif1, @KentPage\n\nAdditional information available at: www.educationcannotwait.org\n\nFor press inquiries:\n\nAnouk Desgroseilliers, adesgroseilliers@un-ecw.org, +1-917-640-6820\n\nKent Page, kpage@unicef.org, +1-917-302-1735\n\nFor other inquiries: info@un-ecw.org\n\nPress Office of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development\n\nPhone: +49 / (0)30 / 18 535-28 70 or -24 51\n\nEmail: presse@bmz.bund.de",
    "Nord Stream 2 pipeline pressure collapses mysteriously overnight": "Authorities in Germany are trying to establish what caused a sudden drop in pressure in the defunct Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, with a spokesperson for its operator saying it could have been a leak.\n\nThe pipeline has been one of the flashpoints in an escalating energy war between Europe and Moscow since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February that has pummelled western economies and sent gas prices soaring.\n\nNord Stream 2’s operator said pressure in the undersea pipeline dropped from 105 to 7 bar overnight.\n\nThe Russian-owned pipeline, which was intended to double the volume of gas flowing from Vyborg, Russia, under the Baltic Sea to Germany, had just been completed and filled with 300m cubic metres of gas when the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, cancelled it shortly before Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nEuropean countries have resisted Russian calls to allow Nord Stream 2 to operate and accused Moscow of using energy as a weapon. Russia denies doing so and blames the west for gas shortages.\n\n“We are currently in contact with the authorities concerned in order to clarify the situation. We still have no clarity about the causes and the exact facts,” said a statement from the German economy ministry.\n\nThe pipeline’s Swiss-based operator, which has legally been wound up, said it had informed all relevant authorities and that the leak, if that were the cause, could not have been at the landing point in Lubmin, northern Germany. “If it were in Lubmin, you’d have heard it,” the spokesperson said.\n\nGazprom referred questions about the incident to the Nord Stream 2 operator.\n\nGermany has informed the Danish authorities about the incident and is trying to establish whether the drop in pressure occurred in German waters. Danish authorities have asked ships to steer clear of a five nautical mile radius off the island of Bornholm.\n\nRussia has cut off gas supplies to several countries and halted flows through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline under the Baltic Sea, accusing western sanctions of hindering operations.\n\nThe suspected leak did not have an immediate impact on gas trading amid signs that Vladimir Putin’s efforts to disrupt energy supplies in Europe this winter will be thwarted.\n\nThe price for British wholesale gas for delivery this weekend dropped nearly 24% to 160p a therm on Monday, with the price for delivery on Tuesday down 17% at 190p a therm.\n\nPrices have tumbled in recent weeks as Europe has made progress in filling up storage facilities for this winter and intervened in the energy market to protect consumers.\n\nThe day-ahead price has fallen sharply since the 589p a therm seen a month ago after Russia’s Gazprom began to throttle flows through the key Nord Stream 1 pipeline.\n\nAsked about the potential leak in Nord Stream 2, Tom Marzec-Manser, the head of gas analytics at Independent Commodity Intelligence Services, said: “In terms of European supply, no one in the market seriously thinks it could become operational and a route to market for Russian gas, so it should have no impact on the price. It’s not a lost supply route – it’s a lost white elephant.”\n\nAnalysts said the fall back in prices was due to a collection of factors including progress in filling up storage facilities. Prices have also fallen due to an increase in wind power generation and signs that routine annual maintenance on Norwegian gasfields has gone to plan without need for further outages.\n\nMarzec-Maser said: “The fact that wind generation has kicked in and there’s plenty of wind power across the continent has eased the pressure on the amount of gas-fired generation required, particularly given the issues with hydro and nuclear.”\n\nLow water levels in southern Norway have disrupted supply of hydroelectric power, while French nuclear power stations have faced problems, including the rising temperature of river water.\n\nMarzec-Maser said concerns remained over how Europe would be supplied next year when storage facilities are likely to be empty and Russian gas is potentially unavailable, unlike earlier this year when efforts to import more gas began.\n\nThe fall in wholesale gas prices should reduce the cost to the UK government of its cap on energy bills. The government has set a £2,500 limit on average household bills, a policy that could cost more than £100bn.",
    "Trent Alexander-Arnold’s World Cup hopes hit by Germany game omission": "Gareth Southgate has cast doubt over Trent Alexander-Arnold’s World Cup hopes by leaving the defender out of England’s Nations League fixture against Germany on Monday night.\n\nThe Liverpool right-back is one of five players who have been omitted from the fixture as the competition’s rules mean Southgate must trim his 28-man squad down to 23 names on matchday. Jarrod Bowen, Fikayo Tomori, James Ward-Prowse and the suspended Jack Grealish have also been left out. Brentford striker Ivan Toney has been included and will hope to win his first cap when England play their final game before their World Cup opener against Iran on 21 November.\n\nHowever, the absence of Alexander-Arnold has raised eyebrows and could mean England look increasingly likely to fly to Qatar without a player who is seen as one of the best in the world in his position. He was an unused substitute during last Friday’s 1-0 defeat to Italy and the fact that he will not feature again on Monday suggests he is running out of time to win Southgate over.\n\nAlexander-Arnold, who has been a shaky presence in Liverpool’s defence this season, has rarely been at his best for England and has struggled to establish himself as one of Southgate’s regulars. The England manager has plenty of options in his position, with Kyle Walker, Reece James and Kieran Trippier all pressing for inclusion, and it appears that doubts over Alexander-Arnold’s defensive qualities are working against him.\n\nEqually there is an argument that Southgate could solve his side’s creative woes by tapping into the Liverpool player’s outstanding passing and crossing. However, that looks an increasingly unlikely prospect. Southgate is expected to stick with his 3-4-3 system against Germany and Alexander-Arnold has not looked comfortable when he has played as a right wing-back at international level.\n\nIf there is encouragement for Alexander-Arnold it is that Southgate planned to pick four right-backs at Euro 2020 only for injury to rule the 23-year-old out of that tournament. But when Southgate was asked about Alexander-Arnold at his pre-match media conference on Sunday, it was notable that he ended up speaking about the other right-backs at his disposal.\n\n“I think he’s a fantastic footballer and he of course adds, as a lot of the other players do, different qualities to the game,” Southgate said. “He does have a fantastic range of passing. We’re blessed with different profiles of player in that position.\n\nGareth Southgate says of his selection decisions at right-back: ‘It’s a really difficult position … ultimately I’ll be judged on the outcome.’ Photograph: Alex Morton/Getty Images\n\n“If we play with wing-backs, Trippier and Reece James are also exceptional with the ball, in different ways, and we’re always having to look at the full package with everything and assess the players on all of their attributes.\n\n“They’ve all been to Champions League finals, some of them have been to the latter stages of major tournaments with us. Trent’s won the league, Trippier’s won the Spanish league, Walker’s won the English league. There are so many good attributes about them, it’s a really difficult position to make decisions on, but we have to go with the ones we believe, and ultimately I’ll be judged on the outcome.”\n\nSign up to The Fiver Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It has not been an easy fit. Southgate was also asked if Alexander-Arnold is too much of a defensive risk. “I don’t see risks,” he insisted. “At Liverpool, they find a way of playing that brings the best out of his attributes and that’s what we’re all trying to do with every team. You’re trying to build a team that accentuates the positives, and within the group protects yourselves against how the opponents might come from you.”\n\nSouthgate added that he was “lambasted” for trying to use Alexander-Arnold’s passing by experimenting him with a midfielder during England’s victory over Andorra at Wembley in 2021.\n\nThe manager is under huge pressure before England host Germany. The Euro 2020 finalists are winless in five matches and Southgate, who has admitted his job will be at risk if the World Cup is a failure, is seeing many of his selection decisions called into doubt.\n\nThere has also been a backlash about the omission of Tomori. The defender is playing at a high level for Milan every week and won the Serie A title last season, but he was also an unused substitute against Italy.",
    "Germany records immense growth in GCC visitors in first half of 2022": "With 318% increase of traffic in 2022, the GCC is the second largest overseas source market for inbound tourism to Germany\n\nGermany’s cultural offerings continue to entice visitors globally with data-driven campaigns proving particularly successful in attracting Emirati travellers\n\nDubai, UAE – The German National Tourist Board (GNTB) has revealed the country recorded a 318 per cent increase on overnight stays from Gulf nationals in the first six months of 2022 when compared to the same period last year*.\n\nGCC nationals were responsible for more than 335,000 stays in H1 2022, compared with a little less than 81,000 in 2021. Such figures confirm the region’s position as representing the biggest growth from an Asian source market.\n\nWhile tourism numbers may not have returned to pre-pandemic levels yet, the promising growth demonstrates the countries strong recovery as it continues to attract tourists.\n\n“The GCC is the top Asian source market, therefore it’s unsurprising with our recent campaigns that there has been such a strong increase,” said Yamina Sofo, director of sales and marketing at the German National Tourist Office, the regional office of GNTB. “Pandemic recovery has long been top of mind and it’s encouraging to see that both longstanding and first-time travellers are increasingly keen to explore everything that Germany has to offer.”\n\nOverall, the Asian source markets have recorded a 252.3 per cent increase in overnight visitors, a jump from just over 217,000 to just under 800,000 in 6 months. The surging increase demonstrates a dedication and determination to travel internationally, despite some countries continuing to implement travel restrictions during the first half of the year.\n\nTo further drive interest in travel to Germany in the remainder of 2022, GNTB has announced the launch of its ‘Feel Good’ campaign, which encompasses a plethora of guiding tips highlighting the country’s eco initiatives that provide conscious tourists with adequate tools and information to reduce their carbon footprint during their travels.\n\nA recent survey by D/A, the Dubai-based consumer insights company, revealed the UAE’s interest in travel has shifted post-pandemic, with relaxation in natural surroundings proving most popular, followed by cultural experiences. The German.Local.Culture campaign, which has been running across the GCC from 10 March, put a focus on driving awareness of the huge number of traditional experiences Germany has to offer, including national crafts and customs, local fare, and the diversity of the history-rich cities, while the Embrace German Nature which ran from 21st April highlighted the plethora of outdoor, nature-focused activities. Aligning with market wants, the campaigns directly attributed to higher footfall from the GCC, said Sofo.\n\nMore details on Germany’s current ‘Feel Good’ campaign: www.germany.travel/en/feel-good/sustainability.html\n\nMore details on Germany’s current ‘German.Local.Culture’ campaign: www.germany.travel/en/campaign/german-local-culture/home.html\n\nMore details on Germany’s ‘Embrace German Nature’ campaign: www.germany.travel/de/trade/marktbearbeitung/globale-kampagnen/embrace-german-nature.html\n\n*2022 inbound figures to Germany from GCC compared to 2019 figures are -36.7 per cent.\n\n-Ends-\n\nAbout the GNTB\n\nThe German National Tourist Board (GNTB) is Germany’s national tourism organisation.

    "England v Germany and a probable two-month long social-media tantrum": "THE NATURAL NATIONAL ORDER\n\nWales are off to their first World Cup in 64 years. Norn Iron have finally won, actually won, a game in the Nations League. And Scotland are currently on a three-match winning tear-up, dangerously close to significant achievement for the first time since 1872. What is all this? Do none of the old certainties apply any more? The Fiver feels so old and confused. Imagine how thankful we are, then, for the recent efforts of Gareth Southgate and his England team. The last few years of success and excitement haven’t sat well with us at all, you see. It’s been extremely discombobulating. So it’s very comforting to see England drifting back towards their old sweet spot, a couple of notches above rank incompetence, hovering just below the middle, between underwhelming and meh. Ah, that’s better. Like sinking into an old armchair with no seat cushion, or a tepid bath.\n\nNot that everyone is as chuffed as The Fiver with the way England are carrying on at the minute. Jude Bellingham was the only player who bothered to turn up for the game against Italy on Friday night, and yet another Nations League defeat was inevitable against 11 men. After England’s relegation from League A was confirmed, Southgate went over to thank the travelling support only to be met with two words: trenchant abuse. All of which means that, while Monday’s Wembley showdown with old pals Germany is now technically academic – Germany can’t win the group, while England are doomed – everyone knows full well how much is riding on it. Can England put on a show to avert an 80,000-strong lid-flipping catastrophe and two-month-long social-media tantrum?\n\nWe’re betting heavily on Perhaps Not. Southgate goes into England’s final game before their Human Rights World Cup campaign full of his trademark positivity, promising to “keep doing the right things every day to keep improving. For me, it’s a great challenge to lead the team through a moment like this.” Whether he’d have hand-picked the Germans for the game that will dictate the national mood for the entirety of autumn is another matter. Germany may have just lost at home to Hungary, but they also recently put five past Italy. Should England be unable to snap their five-game winless sequence against a team who have only lost one of their last 14, the pressure on Southgate could become almost unbearable. Most of the noise will certainly be unlistenable. Good luck, then, England: here’s to a morale-restoring win.

    "Germany lags far behind on gender equality in agriculture, study finds": "Germany is lagging far behind its EU counterparts when it comes to the share of farms being managed or passed on to women according to a new study, which points to the far-reaching consequences this has on their financial security.\n\nRead the original German story here.\n\nOnly 11% of farms in Germany are managed by women, according to a recent nationwide study conducted by the Thünen Institute and the University of Göttingen on behalf of the German agriculture ministry.\n\nOn top of that, only one in five of the people set to inherit or otherwise take over farms are women, the study added.\n\n“The results show that women in rural areas are performing tasks of systemic importance, but are at the same time often not very visible in terms of financial matters,” explained Agriculture Minister Cem Özdemir at an event where the results of the study were presented on 22 September.\n\nSpecifically, the study points to an imbalance between women’s far-reaching responsibilities on farms and how this is reflected legally.\n\n83% of the women farmers surveyed said they work on their family’s farm, while almost three-quarters said they are also involved in strategic and entrepreneurial decisions. But only in very few cases is this contribution also reflected legally, as evidenced by the low proportion of female farm managers.\n\n“In contrast to many other countries, de facto joint farm management is not recorded statistically in Germany,” according to the report.\n\nFinancial insecurity\n\nThe consequences on the financial security of women farmers are far-reaching.\n\nThe report’s authors point out that divorce, separation or the death of their partners could plunge female farmers into financial insecurity, stressing that this has ramifications for women’s healthcare and old-age provision.\n\nIn case of divorce or death, for example, “the risk of female old-age poverty is significantly higher and still too few are covered by contracts or wills,” President of the German Rural Women’s Association Petra Bentkämper stressed in a statement.\n\n“These risks must be talked about openly,” she added.\n\nThe study’s authors are thus urging women on farms to start taking care of social security coverage, together with their partners, at an early stage.\n\nAt the same time, the report calls on insurance providers to “examine the risk of possible pension gaps for women with different employment histories” and to draw their attention to solutions for this.\n\nIn France, for example, the government passed a pension reform at the start of February that is set to benefit women farmers.\n\nGerman women still face 'greater hurdles' in EU farm fund access German women tend to benefit less than men from the support programmes of the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), Juliane Vees, the first vice-president of the German Association of Women in Agriculture, told EURACTIV Germany in an interview.\n\nTackling gender inequality\n\nTo tackle the root cause of gender inequality in the agricultural sector, the study’s authors stress it is necessary to address underlying barriers to entry such as outdated gender images and traditional inheritance practices.\n\n“In order for more women to take over and manage farms, a fundamental change in agricultural traditions is necessary, coupled with more educational work at agricultural educational institutions,” explained Janna Luisa Pieper from the University of Göttingen at the study’s presentation.\n\nIt is important that the educational work is not only directed at women, said Pieper: “Gender-equitable agriculture concerns everyone.”\n\nIn addition to counselling, education and mentoring services, the experts also believe that support programmes must be created or adapted to make it easier for women to start their own agricultural businesses even without inheriting a family farm.\n\nBut while Germany does support young farmers in setting up their own businesses, it is not doing enough for female entrepreneurs in the agriculture sector, according to the European Commission.\n\nIn its observation letter on Germany’s National Strategic Plan for the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform, the EU executive said the country needed to pay more attention to issues such as the “income gap between the sexes” or “the gender gap among farm managers, especially young farmers.”\n\nMore detailed data needed\n\nHowever, data on the income gap in Germany’s agriculture sector is very scarce.\n\nThe report presented last week, for example, is the first nationwide study on the situation of women in agriculture for which associations, like the LandFrauenverband, had long campaigned for.\n\nThe authors are thus calling for collecting more detailed data on the topic to identify better and address women’s obstacles in the field.\n\n“Even if we have been aware of many things for a long time, we need figures and evidence to be able to initiate changes politically,” said LandFrauenverband’s Bentkämper.\n\nWomen farmers 'essential' for future, says French agriculture minister An increasing number of women in France are entering the agricultural world, dominated by men for so long. EURACTIV France takes a closer look at the role of women farmers in the country.\n\n[Edited by Natasha Foote/Nathalie Weatherald]",
    "Germany nationalises biggest gas importer to avert supply crisis": "Germany has agreed to nationalise its biggest gas importer, Uniper, to avert a crisis as it battles energy shortages resulting from Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\nThe deal builds on a rescue package agreed in July, when Berlin took a 30% stake in the company, and includes a capital injection of €8bn (about £7bn) of government money.\n\nUniper had been controlled by the Finnish state-owned energy company Fortum, which welcomed the announcement. It said Berlin would buy its shares for €500m, giving the state a 98.5% stake in the gas company.\n\nFortum’s chief executive, Markus Rauramo, said: “Under the current circumstances in the European energy markets and recognising the severity of Uniper’s situation, the divestment of Uniper is the right step to take, not only for Uniper but also for Fortum.\n\n“The role of gas in Europe has fundamentally changed since Russia attacked Ukraine, and so has the outlook for a gas-heavy portfolio. As a result, the business case for an integrated group is no longer viable.”\n\nHe said Uniper’s losses caused by Russia’s limiting natural gas supplies to European countries supporting Ukraine had reached almost €8.5bn. Missing deliveries from Russia have had to be replaced with expensive supplies from the open market, where prices for gas have risen sharply.\n\nUniper, which also owns the Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station in Nottinghamshire, posted an overall loss of £12bn in August, and has seen its share price collapse by 90% in the past year.\n\nEurope is reliant on gas to heat homes, and to generate electricity to power factories, raising fears of business closures, rationing and a recession as the weather turns cold.\n\nCountries across the continent have scrambled to counter soaring gas and electricity prices, to help households and businesses, and to secure their energy supplies for winter, including by filling their natural gas storage.\n\nSign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Berlin's proposal is to ban EU citizens from the boards or supervisory boards of Russia’s government-owned companies.\n\nRead also: Zelensky appoints new ambassador to Germany\n\nThe German authorities argue that in this way, it would be possible to hinder the Kremlin's attempts to increase political pressure on the EU member states and restrict corruption.\n\nAt the same time, the ban is not expected to extend to the European-based subsidiaries of Russian companies.\n\nIt should be recalled that the ex-Chancellor of Germany, Gerhard Schroeder, had worked as the head of the board of directors of Rosneft until he quit in May 2022. Schroeder is considered Putin’s “friend,” while his work for the Russian regime bore reputational costs for Germany.\n\nAs reported earlier, the eighth package of sanctions is unlikely to include a cap on Russian oil prices.",

    "Can Germany’s economy minister keep the lights on this winter?": "That Robert Habeck, Germany’s economy minister in his recent, pre-ministerial life, wrote a children’s book in which a girl called Emily experiences “how exciting a night-time power cut can be” may yet come back to haunt him.\n\nThese days, Habeck is charged with the daunting task of ensuring that the lights do not go out in for real in Europe’s largest economy. And even if Germans have been hoarding candles and camping stoves, just as not so long ago they were doing with toilet paper and pasta, they consider the prospect of a blackout and cold homes to be scary rather than exciting. Reports of people illegally felling trees for fuel have brought back memories of postwar squalor, when Berlin’s Tiergarten park was stripped bare as Germans tried to keep warm.\n\nBut a blackout is not so unrealistic since Moscow closed down the Nord Stream 1 pipeline more than a week ago. Habeck was in danger of appearing more than a little triumphalist when he remarked to the Bundestag on Thursday that “we’ve now been independent of Russian gas for a week”; it was not him, or Germany, but Putin who reduced Moscow’s leverage on Europe via energy supplies.\n\nWhile the cutoff may perhaps have helped to ease a little the conscience of many Germans who have felt that every time they turned on the shower they were supporting Russia’s war, more responsibility lies on Habeck’s shoulders right now than any other minister, even Chancellor Olaf Scholz. He must also try to keep the economy going amid gloomy predictions that owing to soaring energy costs and high inflation the country will slide into recession next year.\n\nBakers in northern Germany on Thursday turned off their lights in protest at the way they had been excluded from the government’s unwieldy sounding Energiekostendämpfungsprogramm, to provide help towards the bills of energy intensive industries, from glass to wallpaper manufacturers. “Lights today, ovens tomorrow?” was the slogan posted on the door of a bakery in the well-to-do Hamburg district of Blankenese. “Bread could yet become a luxury good that only rich people can afford,” the owner said, desperate for recognition that her gas provider had cancelled her contract and she was facing a monthly gas bill that had gone from €3,800 (£3,300) to €8,000.\n\nJust a few months ago many people were regularly glancing at the coronavirus figures. These days it’s the Gasspeicher-Füllstand – gas storage filling level – that attracts feverish attention. On Friday the 47 subterranean facilities around the country were 87% full, thanks to imports from other countries, namely Belgium, Norway and the Netherlands. It sounds high but is only part of the picture as when full, the facilities hold just 28% of the total amount of gas Germany uses in an average year. The aim is for 95% capacity by 1 November, but a harsh winter or any technical mishaps could cause the stores to empty well before winter is out. And there is also next winter to think of, when the stores will probably be empty with no Russian gas in sight.\n\nIndustry has already reduced its usage by more than a fifth (but with consequences – ammonia production is down by about 70%) and is currently “saving” about 300 gigawatt hours a day. Considering gas use can shoot up to 5,000 GWh on cold winter days, this is just a drop in the ocean.\n\nEnergy specialists say that despite Scholz’s insistence that Germany would have enough energy to get through the winter, it is too early to be optimistic. Already in a colder than usual September, consumption has been higher than expected.\n\nHouseholds are being urged to reduce their consumption by about 20% but the expected higher household bills that might encourage savings have in many cases not yet landed on the doormat. The government, careful not to appear alarmist, has done little so far to encourage domestic saving and the focus has instead been on turning swimming pool temperatures down or switching off illumination of the Brandenburg Gate. Habeck has frequently made a point of saying that he has reduced his showers to a minimum and fitted a water-saving shower head, but is also wary of appearing condescending.\n\nHope lies in the liquid gas that Germany expects to receive via two state-chartered floating terminals at Wilhelmshaven and Brunsbüttel, due to go into operation at the turn of the year, and a third by a private consortium in Lubmin. Energy market experts warn however that demand for LNG could be fierce in winter, particularly from Asia.\n\nA mild winter could have a significant impact but pressure is now growing on the coalition government from within its own ranks – the pro-business FDP – and the opposition conservatives, for a reversal of Angela Merkel’s 2011 commitment made in response to the Fukushima disaster to withdraw from nuclear power.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The decision has attracted ridicule and scorn: Green supporters are wary this might mark the slow return to nuclear and, added to the schlamassel, a Yiddish-derived term for a mess, one of the plant’s operators has called the plans “technically unworkable”. Some have said the operator is simply angry at the financial loss that being in “standby” rather than fully operational mode means for his company.\n\nBut in immediate terms, Germany now faces nothing less than weighing up which is greater – its angst over atomic power or a blackout.",

I write “Lederhosen”.\n\nIt’s not that they look silly (though they do). It’s not that they mark me out instantly as a tourist (they don’t, actually; plenty of locals are wearing them). It’s – and I’m sorry, there’s no non-invasive way of saying this – the chafing.\n\nFortunately, there is a lubricant-cum-emollient-cum-anaesthetic available, in one-litre (two-pint!) doses, as I’m attending the opening weekend of Oktoberfest 2022.

    "Germany’s Die Linke on verge of split over sanctions on Russia": "Germany’s Die Linke could split into two parties over the Ukraine war, as the ailing leftwing party’s indecisive stance over economic sanctions against Russia triggered a series of high-profile resignations this week.\n\nThe German Left party’s future has hung in a precarious balance since it snuck into the national parliament last autumn under a special provision for parties that win three or more constituency seats. Should three of its 39 delegates resign from the party, Die Linke would lose its status as a parliamentary group and attached privileges over speaking times and committee memberships.\n\nParty insiders say such resignations are a matter of when, not if, after a week of vicious public in-fighting over a speech in which the former co-leader Sahra Wagenknecht accused the German government of “launching an unprecedented economic war against our most important energy supplier”.\n\nSupporters of Wagenknecht, a controversial but prominent figurehead, are already hatching plans for a breakaway party to compete in the 2024 European elections, the German newspaper Taz reported this week.\n\nSuch a split would be likely to spell the end of Die Linke, 15 years after it was founded in a merger between the successor to East Germany’s Socialist Unity party and former Social Democrats disillusioned by their party’s direction under Gerhard Schröder, and just under a decade after it formed the largest opposition force in the Bundestag’s 2013-17 term.\n\nIn her speech last Thursday, Wagenknecht had called chancellor Olaf Scholz’s left-leaning governing coalition “the stupidest government in Europe” because it imposed sanctions on Russia, which supplied over half of Germany’s gas needs before the start of the war in the spring.\n\n“Yes, of course the war in Ukraine is a crime”, Wagenknecht said. “But how dumb is the idea that we can punish Putin by pushing millions of German families into poverty and destroy our economy while Gazprom makes record profits?” The speech was greeted with applause not only by the Linke leadership but also by delegates of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD).\n\nWagenknecht no longer holds any official positions in Die Linke, but was nominated to be its sole speaker in the recent parliamentary session on the national climate budget.\n\nIn the run-up to the speech, Die Linke’s parliamentary co-chair Dietmar Bartsch had reportedly urged Wagenknecht to avoid calling for an opening of Nord Stream 2, the Russian gas pipeline project that was halted shortly before the invasion of Ukraine in February.\n\nWhile the 53-year-old did not mention Nord Stream 2, her “economic war” comments proved incendiary. Even though the German government has used similar language to describe its standoff with the Kremlin over gas deliveries, Wagenknecht suggested that the act of aggression in this conflict had been initiated by the west.\n\n“The thesis that the federal republic of Germany is leading an economic war against Russia reverses cause and effect”, said Bodo Ramelow, the Left party state premier for Thuringia. “The phrase ‘the USA’s economic war against Russia’ is Kremlin propaganda”, said Martina Renner, a former deputy leader of the leftwing outfit.\n\nWhile Die Linke has broadly opposed the delivery of heavy weapons to Ukraine, it voted in favour of economic sanctions against Russia in May, and a party congress in June condemned Putin’s war of aggression in Ukraine as “imperialist”.\n\nSplits in the leftwing party, present since Die Linke’s founding, have become increasingly entrenched in recent years.\n\nThe biggest and most bitter split is between reformists who see the party’s future in a space where different union and social justice movements overlap, and those more traditional, nationalist leftists gathered around Wagenknecht, who accuse what they call the “lifestyle left” of having betrayed the party’s traditional working-class base.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With the party’s parliamentary status in a fine balance, there have until now been few attempts to rock the boat by seeking an open conflict.\n\nWagenknecht had ended her speech by calling for the resignation of the minister for economic affairs, Robert Habeck. Instead, her contribution triggered the resignations of two high-profile members.\n\nUlrich Schneider, the head of the German welfare association Der Paritätische, on Monday announced via Twitter he had handed in his membership over the party letting Wagenknecht take the podium. “That was too much”, said Schneider, who heads Germany’s largest umbrella organisation of self-help initiatives in the area of health and social work.\n\nFabio di Masi, a former Linke MP who had remained its most prolific financial expert even after standing down as an MP last year, said a day later he was also handing in his membership, as he no longer wanted to bear responsibility for the “blatant failure of key actors in this party”.\n\nThe draining of support is reflected at a grassroot level. According to internal party figures seen by the Guardian, Die Linke has lost more than 3,000 members – or 5.5% of its total membership –in the first half of this year.\n\nAfter gaining 4.9% of the vote at federal elections last September, the leftwing party has failed to make it over the electoral threshold at five consecutive state elections.",
    "Germany must shake off its habit of finding excuses for inaction": "A German decision to send Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine would send a powerful signal to the Kremlin, Constanze Stelzenmüller writes. This article originally appeared in the Financial Times .\n\nLife: it’s unfair. German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht gave a long-prepared speech in Berlin on Monday, in which she laid out her thinking on strategy. She asserted confidently that Germany was destined by “our size, our geographical location, our economic power, in short our heft” to be a “leading power in Europe, whether we like it or not.”\n\nThe strategic adversaries uppermost in Lambrecht’s mind are, however, at home. She is striving to assert her authority at a time when the Foreign Ministry is writing Germany’s first ever national security strategy. It does not help that leaders of her Social Democratic Party (SPD)’s parliamentary group are vocal skeptics of what some pointedly refer to as “chic bellicism,” or a fashionable taste for war.\n\nLambrecht’s task is to remind them forcefully that the Zeitenwende, or turning point, promised by SPD Chancellor Olaf Scholz in a landmark speech after Russia’s attack on Ukraine needs to be sustained and funded. Especially for the armed forces.\n\nUnfortunately, her audience — including Germany’s allies — was interested in a different question: how Berlin’s destiny to lead relates to Ukraine’s urgent requests for more heavy weapons. Contrary to the fears of many — and the hopes of some — across the west, Kyiv’s armed forces have achieved an astonishing rout of the invaders, regaining more territory in a week than Russia captured in five months.\n\nCaution remains warranted. But for the first time, a Russian defeat appears possible if Ukraine can press its advantage across the long frontline. As Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told his German counterpart Annalena Baerbock, this is impossible without armored infantry carriers and battle tanks.\n\nLambrecht, echoing Scholz, parried that no other ally had delivered Western-built infantry fighting vehicles or main battle tanks; that this would deprive NATO allies of German protection; and that Germany would never “go it alone.” Also, such weapons deliveries would represent an “escalation” — meaning Russian President Vladimir Putin could then consider Germany a direct participant in the conflict. This is the brightest of red lines for Scholz’s three-party ruling coalition.\n\nCue yet another fierce Berlin brouhaha over heavy weapons deliveries. Ricarda Lang, co-chair of Scholz’s Greens coalition partner, tweeted that “the time for hesitancy is over.” Parliamentary defense committee chair Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann of the Free Democrats, the third coalition partner and herself something of a lethal weapon, demanded immediate deliveries of German Marder infantry carriers and Leopard 2 tanks.\n\nMore unusually, the U.S. Embassy in Berlin waded in with a three-part tweet thread: the U.S. appreciates German contributions; allies should support Ukraine “as much as possible”; each country is free to decide on the manner of its support (this last part blew up a smokescreen deployed for months by the German government).\n\nTranslated from diplo-speak: love you, Berlin, but please, please grow a pair and stop pretending we’re telling you what to do.\n\nIn truth, the government’s position is untenable. Other allies have sent armored infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine. Some have sent tanks, mostly modernized Soviet-era versions. The 24 Gepard armorred air defense systems and 10 Panzerhaubitze 2,000 howitzers Berlin has sent to Ukraine, plus much other kit, have, by Kyiv’s admission, made a real difference in its counteroffensive. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg is asking allies to prioritize deliveries to Ukraine. As for red lines, the Russian ambassador opines they were crossed a while ago.\n\nThe only serious concern about Leopard 2 tanks is that they are sophisticated machines which would require three or four months of training. But the Ukrainians are fast learners and Russia still occupies a fifth of their territory. Deciding to send the tanks now would send a powerful signal to the Kremlin that Germany won’t be intimidated.\n\nDuring the Cold War, leaders of a partly sovereign West Germany intoned a trinity of compelling reasons (Zwang) why they absolutely could not do something: rules, allies, and facts (Normzwang, Bündniszwang, and Sachzwang). Usually, it meant they absolutely didn’t want to.\n\nMore than 30 years later, after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the regaining of full sovereignty, it’s a disingenuous habit Germany needs to shake off. It’s certainly unworthy of a country that aspires to leadership in Europe.",

    "Germany to rebuild bridge over Rhine that collapsed during WW2": "Officials in Germany have announced plans to rebuild a bridge over the Rhine that collapsed days after its capture by US soldiers in the final weeks of the second world war.\n\nThe bridge at Remagen, which featured in a 1969 film of the same name starring George Segal, Ben Gazzara and Robert Vaughn, focusing on the heroism of the allies’ final advance into Germany, could be standing again within a decade, town planners have said.\n\nThe suspension bridge, known locally as the Ludendorff Brücke, which was 325 metres long and six metres wide, would be reserved solely for pedestrians and cyclists, and stand as a monument to the victims of war, including those who died when it collapsed almost 80 years ago.\n\nIn a poll of locals in 2020, 91% voted in favour of rebuilding the bridge, with many saying that if only from a purely pragmatic point of view they were keen on a crossing over the Rhine. There is no river crossing for about 27 miles (44km) and only a limited number of ferry boats.\n\nMarc Bors, a trade and industry promoter for the town of Remagen, which has a population of 17,456, said an engineer had been commissioned to draw up plans to reconstruct the bridge that were “viable and realistic”.\n\nWhen it collapsed, all that remained of the bridge – which was built during the first world war by Russian prisoners of war to facilitate the delivery of personnel, equipment and supplies to German troops on the western front – were the towers on its western bank in Remagen, which were converted into a peace museum, and those on the eastern bank in the village of Erpel, which are used as a performing arts space.\n\nLocal communities have signalled their readiness to help finance the project, expected to cost around €22m, including restoration of the remaining towers, but they have also asked the state of Rheinland-Pfalz and the federal government for funds, citing the symbolic importance of the project “which extends far beyond the region”, the town said in a statement.\n\nThe US army crossed the bridge on 7 March 1945 after the retreat of the Wehrmacht from France, the first opportunity they had to cross the strategically vital Rhine. German forces’ attempts to blow it up by placing explosives at strategic points along the bridge failed, and allied engineers succeeded in removing the explosives before capturing the bridge.\n\nIt collapsed 10 days later, killing 28 army engineers. Ten of the bodies were never found, thought to have been swept away in the strong current of the river. The bridge, along with other hastily constructed pontoon bridges, allowed the US army to transport about 125,000 troops along with tanks, artillery and other vehicles over the river towards the east. Historians agree that its capture helped to shorten the war, which ended two months later, on 8 May.\n\nThe Bridge at Remagen was filmed in the central Bohemian town of Davle, in what was then Czechoslovakia.",
    "Musiala happy with choice to represent Germany": "Born in Stuttgart, Musiala spent a significant part of his childhood in England and was with Chelsea from 2011 until 2019, while he also captained the Three Lions at youth level.\n\nHowever, he returned to Germany in 2019 to join Bayern Munich and elected to represent Die Mannschaft last year.\n\nMusiala will now face off against the side he could have represented on Monday and made it clear he has no regrets about the decision on his international allegiance.\n\n\"I feel good to be here in England. I am very motivated. England are a very strong team and my past makes me want to play even more,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't know exactly how many times I've played at Wembley. I've been to school tournaments here before and made it to a final there twice. The atmosphere at Wembley is always great.\n\n\"It wasn't an easy decision and I thought about it for a long time.

Some England fans are definitely not happy with my decision but that shows that I play well.\"\n\nFlick has confirmed Musiala will start for Germany in its UEFA Nations League dead rubber at Wembley and heaped praise upon the 19-year-old.\n\n\"When he trained for the first time, you immediately noticed what a talent he is. His development is fantastic,\" he declared.\n\n\"He can hold his own well in a small space and has a strong feeling for the space. He is also very strong at dribbling, which is why he can solve situations for us.\n\n\"In addition, he is very skilled defensively and has many ball wins. I'm glad he's playing for Germany.\"",
    "‘What is Berlin afraid of?’ Ukraine presses Germany for more military kit": "Ukraine has ramped up the pressure on Germany to deliver more military hardware as Kyiv pursues its counter-offensive in the east and south against Russian forces.\n\nThe Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, accused the German government of ignoring Kyiv’s requests for Leopard tanks and Marder infantry fighting vehicles.\n\nHe said Berlin had only given “abstract fears and excuses” over why it was not providing more equipment.\n\nKuleba tweeted: “Disappointing signals from Germany while Ukraine needs Leopards and Marders now, to liberate people and save them from genocide.\n\n“Not a single rational argument on why these weapons cannot be supplied, only abstract fears and excuses. What is Berlin afraid of that Kyiv is not?”\n\nHe was speaking on Tuesday after a meeting with his German counterpart, Annalena Baerbock, in Kyiv at the weekend.\n\nThe Green party politician, who had travelled by night train for her second visit as foreign minister to the Ukrainian capital, pledged further support from Germany, saying the advances made by the Ukrainian army in pushing Russian forces back were a “good argument” for the west’s delivery of weapons.\n\nBut when pushed by Kuleba to specifically support the delivery of Leopard 2 tanks, Baerbock said: “We’re already delivering heavy weapons.”\n\nShe then listed the weapons systems Germany had already sent to Ukraine, referring to its multilateral exchange programme and the agreements it has with other western partners, adding: “I know that time is of the essence.”\n\nBaerbock is believed to want to step up German participation but must first win the support of the other parties in the three-way coalition government.\n\nOthers in her party, led by the co-leader Omid Nouripour, backed calls for a speedy delivery to Ukraine of Leopard tanks. “Everyone in the government knows that even more would be possible,” Nouripour told a German newspaper.\n\nAnton Hofreiter, a leading member of the Green party, said in an interview with Mediengruppe Bayern: “Sooner or later, we will have no other choice than to deliver modern, western battle tanks to Ukraine.”\n\nHe said Russia had largely destroyed Ukraine’s armaments industry. At the same time, the old Soviet tanks that Ukraine possessed offered “bad protection” against Russian attack, Hofreiter added.\n\n“I believe we should be delivering Leopard tanks as quickly as possible in order to prevent Ukrainian soldiers from dying unnecessarily,” he said.\n\nMembers of the pro-business Free Democratic party and the opposition conservative CDU/CSU alliance have also backed the calls.\n\nOnly the Social Democratic party of the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, is seen to be hesitant. He has repeatedly said there should be no “deutscher Alleingang” (meaning Germany going it alone), which has been the backbone of Germany’s foreign policy since the second world war, but is increasingly being interpreted, from Kyiv to Washington, as potentially hazardous and feeble indecision in the current circumstances.\n\nScholz’s hesitation is seen by some as a wariness over further exacerbating tensions with Moscow and nervousness about an energy crisis that is being used by groups on the left and right to turn some of the electorate away from supporting Ukraine.\n\nOn Monday, Scholz insisted that the weapons Germany had delivered – including Gepard anti-aircraft guns, howitzers and Mars rocket launchers – “are actually contributing to the fact that it is now possible in the battle on the eastern front to change the outcome just in the way that we are seeing right now”.\n\nEven as initial reports of the Ukrainian counter-offensive were trickling in last week, the defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, ruled out increasing weapons supplies to Ukraine, saying Germany’s stocks were depleted and that it needed to keep supplies to ensure the country can defend itself until it could use a €100bn (£87bn) package pledged by Scholz in February to purchase more equipment.\n\nAmy Gutmann, the US ambassador to Germany, urged the German government on Sunday evening to commit to sending more weapons, telling the public broadcaster ZDF that while she welcomed and admired how Germans had supported Ukraine so far, “my expectations are even higher”.\n\nBerlin has repeatedly pointed to Washington’s hesitancy in delivering certain types of weaponry – from tanks to fighter jets – to defend its own restraint.",
    "Germany and France put energy diplomacy at the top of their agendas": "European governments are entering the final stretch of the race against the clock as they compete against Putin for a winter of reliable energy security. This last quarter of 2022 is witnessing a strong prioritisation of energy diplomacy by EU executives, as evidenced by the upcoming visits of the Macron government's Prime Minister Elizabeth Borne to Algeria and this weekend's visit to the Middle East by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\n\nFrom Berlin, the Social Democrat chancellor once again promised to control electricity and gas prices this winter. The nightmare of Scholz's government since he took office has been Germany's energy supply, which has been deeply dependent on Russia for decades. Since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, the German leader's poll ratings have plummeted, not least because of the links of several members of his team to the Russian government - links that the German government has worked to deny by firmly supporting Ukraine in the conflict, supplying major arms packages, including Gepard anti-aircraft systems among other weapons systems.\n\nPutins Krieg stellt auch uns vor viele Herausforderungen: Hungersnöte verhindern, Energieversorgung sichern, die hohen Energiepreise abfedern und für #Entlastungen bei den Bürgerinnen, Bürgern und Unternehmen sorgen. All diese Aufgaben lösen wir gemeinsam. #KanzlerKompakt. pic.twitter.com/FFMMDhYDGB — Bundeskanzler Olaf Scholz (@Bundeskanzler) September 24, 2022\n\n\"We want to ensure that electricity prices are brought down again by changing the market model. And we want to see to it that gas prices come down,\" Scholz said in a video published in the chancellery's media on Saturday. The German government has been juggling for months between sanctions against Russia and the search for new ways of obtaining gas supplies. Already earlier this summer, the Scholz government's energy minister, the Green Robert Habeck, travelled to Qatar to meet with his counterparts and reach agreements to increase the supply of non-liquefied gas to Germany. The Middle East solution seems more promising for now than the Medcat pipeline, which remains blocked by France despite the intention of Spain, Portugal and the European Commission to implement it.\n\nScholz has a busy weekend ahead of him with plans to visit the Arab Gulf states. According to information from Birgit Jennen for Bloomberg, citing sources in Scholz's cabinet, the German chancellor is all set to finalise the signing of several LNG and hydrogen supply deals during his tour.\n\nThe visit will take him to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, accompanied by a \"high-level\" business delegation, of which the German government has not provided many more details. According to the same Chancellery sources, Germany has been trying for months to reach a long-term agreement to open up supply channels with Saudi Arabia.\n\nPHOTO/Presidencia de Rusia - Russian President Vladimir Putin receives German Chancellor Olaf Scholz at the Kremlin amid the crisis in Ukraine, 15 February 2022\n\nIt was also revealed that negotiations with the United Arab Emirates are very close to concluding another hydrogen supply agreement to reduce dependence on Russia in the long term. If these prognoses come true, Scholz would keep his word and the Social Democratic leader could regain some of those points lost in the public eye behind closed doors.\n\nElizabeth Borne back in Algiers\n\nFrom Paris, the Matignon hotel, the headquarters of Macron's prime minister, it was reported that Elizabeth Borne will travel with a large delegation to Algiers on 9 and 10 October. This is the fifth meeting between the French and Algerian governments since Macron's state visit in August.\n\nThis time, the Prime Minister will discuss the gas dossier, which is why she will travel in the company of senior officials from ENGIE, the public gas company, and will meet with delegates from Sonatrach, as well as the Prime Minister of Tebboune, Aïmane Benabderrahmane. The French government announced last week that significant progress would soon be made in negotiations to increase gas supplies to France from Algeria.\n\nPHOTO/GOUVERNEMENT FRANÇAIS - EHitherto Prime Minister Jean Castex passes the baton to the new head of government Élisabeth Borne during the ceremony at the Matignon Palace\n\nAccording to French channel Europe 1, Borne's visit to Algiers could lead to a 50 per cent increase in Algerian gas exports to France. According to French public data, the French energy mix is 20% dependent on gas. In this distribution, Algerian gas represents between 8% and 9% of the total, figures that could change if Europe 1's information is true.\n\nIf these new agreements are approved, France advocates transporting gas by sea, the same method that experts close to the Elysée recommend using instead of investing in the Mecat pipeline.",

    "Is Germany's economy too dependent on China?": "The Port of Hamburg, Germany's biggest seaport, is considered the country's gateway to the world. But above all, it is a gateway to China, which is the port's largest customer. In the first half of 2022 alone, more than 1.3 million containers from China arrived here.\n\nNow, Chinese shipping giant COSCO wants to take a 35% stake in the harbor, and its operators would like that, too. They say this would make the container terminal a prime transshipment hub in Europe for the world's largest shipping company. But the Economy Ministry in Berlin has reservations and may not approve COSCO's investment in the Hamburg Port. The dispute over COSCO's involvement illustrates how rethinking ties with China impacts the German economy.\n\nGermany's dependence on Russian gas has proved to be a weak point following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This realization has led the government to revisit the country's relationship with China as well. Some 5,000 German companies operate in China today.\n\nHow to deal with an autocracy that has been Germany's largest trading partner for years? How to deal with the country that EU documents refer to as a \"partner,” a \"competitor” and \"strategic rival” — with the balance shifting toward the latter?\n\nHabeck: 'The naivety towards China is over'\n\n‘End of naivety'\n\nGerman Economy Minister and Vice-Chancellor, Robert Habeck from the Green Party, has already announced a \"more robust trade policy\" toward China. \"The time of naivety toward China is over,\" Habeck declared in mid-September after a meeting of G7 economy ministers.\n\nBack in May, Habeck denied the VW Group guarantees for investments in China. That came as a shock: For decades, German companies' business in China had been backed by guarantees on both investments and exports.\n\n\"In the near future, if German companies want to invest, if they trade with China, they are likely to do so at their own risk and will no longer be able to rely on government guarantees and safeguards,\" says China expert Tim Rühlig of the German Council on Foreign Relations (DGAP). He sees a change of course: the German government \"no longer wants to provide incentives for German companies to expand business in China,\" Rühling tells DW in an interview.\n\nBut that does not stop them from doing so anyway. According to a study by Jürgen Matthes, an economist with the German Economic Institute (IW), the German industry invested around €10 billion in China in the first half of this year alone — a record figure.\n\nCar manufacturers and chemical companies in particular are continuing to seek a foothold in the Chinese market. According to a study published by the Rhodium Group in mid-September, the four German industrial giants — carmakers VW, BMW, Mercedes and chemical company BASF — alone account for a third of European direct investment in China.\n\nVolkswagen is one of the major German investors in China\n\nOr is the dependence overestimated?\n\n80% of European investments are made by just 10 large European companies, according to Jörg Wuttke, president of the European Chamber of Commerce in China. \"The others are not leaving China, but are currently interested in other countries for new investments and are also thinking about diversification,\" Wuttke observes.\n\nEurope's top ten companies, however, are heavily reliant on China, he warns, pointing to dependence on China for imports of rare-earth elements, preliminary products for the pharmaceutical industry, and for photovoltaic systems. But dependence on China is fundamentally different from reliance on Russian energy, he says: \"We have a pipeline with oil and gas from Russia. But from China, we have a 'pipeline' with toys, furniture, sports equipment, clothing, shoes. Most of those products — I would say 90% of them — are easily replicable elsewhere.\"\n\nAround 3% of German jobs depend on exports to China, economist Matthes points out. \"That's over 1 million jobs. That is a considerable number, but over 45 million people are employed in Germany today,\" he says, and concludes: \"On a macroeconomic level, the dependence on China as an export market is relevant, but it's not as huge as media reports often make it out to be.\"\n\nImportant for the energy transition: Solar cells from China\n\nPressure from the Green Party\n\nNevertheless, within Germany's new center-left coalition government of Social Democrats (SPD), neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP) and environmentalist Greens, the latter in particular are putting pressure on companies to rethink their ties with China.\n\nAt the beginning of September, Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told business leaders: \"We can't afford to just hope that things won't be so bad after all with these autocratic regimes.\" The Green Party politician, who stands for \"a values-based and feminist foreign policy,\" announced the development of a new China strategy as part of a new National Security Strategy. \"It is important to the German government and to me personally that we transfer what we have learned from our dependence on Russia to our new China strategy,\" she says.\n\nThe Economy Ministry is considering ways to encourage companies to turn to other Asian countries, instead of China. Government investment and export guarantees are being reappraised. The government-owned KfW Bank is to examine whether it could scale back its China program and instead offer more loans for business in countries including Indonesia.\n\nLast year, the Federation of German Industries (BDI) was already debating rules for foreign trade policy cooperation with autocracies. It suggested a \"concept of responsible coexistence in foreign economic policy and clear boundaries for any cooperation.\"\n\nFor many managers, however, the change of course in the Economy Ministry goes too far.\n\n\"Government support and protection of German companies' business in China must remain, in principle,\" Friedolin Strack, chief executive of the Asia-Pacific Committee of German Business (APA), told the news agency Reuters.\n\nChinese investments should be welcome in Germany and Europe, he insisted. Whether this should also apply to the specific case of COSCO's entry into the Hamburg Port, however, Strack did not want to say.\n\nThis article was originally written in German.\n\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

    "England and Germany involved in mad 3-3 draw in Nations League": "Gareth Southgate's substitutions inspired an incredible comeback from England, but Nick Pope's mistake handed Germany a draw in the Nations League.\n\nLoading…\n\nEngland went into Monday night's game in their worst form since before Southgate took over as manager, with real pressure mounting on him for the first time.\n\nLast week's loss to Italy had seen them get relegated from the Nations League top group, after failing to win their opening five games.\n\nThe match against Germany was to be their last before the World Cup, and they were in need of a huge boost, having only scored once from open play in recent games.\n\nThe hosts had slightly the better of the first half, with Luke Shaw's excellent ball creating the best chance for Raheem Sterling, but the teams went into the break at 0-0.\n\nIt was Germany who took the lead in the 52nd minutes after Harry Maguire, selected despite lots of criticism, gave away a penalty with a sloppy challenge on Jamal Musiala.\n\nAnd the Manchester United captain was criticised again in the 67th minute, when he lost possession high up the pitch, which eventually saw the visitors double their lead, with Chelsea's Kai Havertz scoring.\n\nEngland however then scored three times in 12 minutes to complete what was an incredible comeback, thanks to Southgate's substitutions.\n\nLuke Shaw pulled one back for the Euro 2020 finalists, his first international goal since that final 15 months ago against Italy, kicking off a mad spell. S\n\nubs Bukayo Saka and Masoun Mount combined for the second, the Chelsea man scoring the equaliser, after incredible work from the Arsenal winger.\n\nHarry Kane then netted the third from the penalty spot, after Jude Bellingham was fouled on the edge of the box, by Borussia Dortmund teammate Nico Schlotterbeck.\n\nIf Southgate and the players, thought they'd finally get their win they were very much mistaken, with Hans Flick's side still having seven minutes of normal time to get an equaliser of their own.\n\nThey only needed four, with Havertz doubling his tally for the night in the 87th minute, but it was all down to a keeping error from Nick Pope.\n\nSerge Gnabry shot from outside the area, and it looked a relatively simple save for the keeper, but the Burnley number one was only able to parry the ball back into Havertz path, with the Chelsea forward tapping in for the equaliser.\n\nThe Newcastle United number one was only deputising in goal due to Jordan Pickford's injury, though it may still inspire some, especially Arsenal fans, to call for Aaron Ramsdale's inclusion in the starting line up.",

    "Five ways a groundbreaking €9 rail pass changed Germany": "While most Germans likely thought they were just living their lives, every weekend getaway, every metro journey to work, every bus ride to the store, and every train trip to a lake to beat this summer’s unprecedented heat was one small part of a gigantic experiment: Germany’s €9 train ticket.\n\nDesigned to offer relief against rising inflation and encourage sustainable travel, it allowed unlimited use of local and regional transport throughout the country.\n\nThe June-August programme, which did not include high-speed rail lines, proved incredibly popular. Over three months, 52 million tickets were sold, according to Germany’s association of public transit companies (VDV).\n\nSo, given its scope, how did the experiment change Germany?\n\n1. Public transport was accessible to everyone\n\nRail travel in Germany has become quite expensive, often prohibitively so. Deutsche Bahn (DB), Germany’s national rail provider, offers regional rail day passes at the state-wide level starting at €22. These are only good if you stay within one state, while national day passes start at €42.\n\nFor those not planning a single day packed with travel, individual regional rail trips are typically more expensive than the passes. Germany’s high-speed \"ICE\" trains cost even more.\n\nThese prices make rail travel unobtainable for many.\n\nYet for a few months, public transport was opened up to a population much more representative of the whole public.\n\n“With the €9 ticket, for many families going on a weekend getaway suddenly became a real possibility. Simply hopping on the train on a Saturday and taking a ride,” Moritz Ehl told Euronews.\n\nEhl is a coordinator at Mobility for All, an organisation in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate that pushes for more accessible transport.\n\n“Families, retirees, and people living in poverty all suddenly had new opportunities for their leisure time, along with the ability to fully participate in society,” said Ehl.\n\nThe programme didn’t just make a rare holiday possible for many struggling with poverty, it eased the financial pressure of everyday life.\n\nGermany’s Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs uses a countrywide cost of living estimate to determine monthly allowances for the roughly seven million Germans receiving social assistance, which includes unemployment, welfare, and retirement benefits.\n\nAs of 2022, the estimate only allows for €39.01 a month for all transportation expenses. The average cost of a monthly local rail pass in German cities is €80.60.\n\n“That means you can maybe take a couple of single rides, but every time you need to really think about whether you can afford the ride. Whether it’s to the doctor, to go shopping, or even to work… All of that is unrealistic for just [€39],” said Ehl.\n\nGiven that even local public transit is out of reach for so many in Germany, it’s no wonder then that Berlin’s local transport authority reported a 14% increase in ticket sales from May 2022.\n\nGermany's €9 rail pass shown alongside fuel prices. Credit: Reuters\n\n2. Some Germans gave up their cars\n\nThe €9 ticket initiative was introduced as part of a larger inflation-relief programme, but it also clearly had climate-related goals as well.\n\nBoosting public transport usage and encouraging drivers to leave their cars at home and hop on trains -- not an easy task in car-loving Germany -- was a key goal.\n\n“Looking at some of the studies that are already out there, it’s not just people that already use public transport [that bought the tickets], there are new users as well,\" said Dr Eva Heinen, a transport researcher at the Technical University of Dortmund, told Euronews. \"Overall, you also see a reduction of car use during the programme,”\n\nAccording to VDV, 10% of the €9 ticket trips replaced vehicle use. They estimate this prevented roughly 1.8 million tonnes of CO2 from entering the atmosphere.\n\nDr Heinen, who is working on a study of the programme’s impact, expects further, independent studies to come in within the next few months.\n\nWhile Dr Heinen argues that rural communities, often poorly-served by public transport, did not benefit as greatly from the programme as urban regions, its broader disruptive nature cannot be discounted.\n\n“You can't underestimate the effect of breaking habits or building new habits,\" she said. \"People will not just suddenly wake up and think ‘you know what, I think I’m going to change’. You need to trigger this sometimes.”\n\nWhile it’s clear there will be a follow-up to the €9 ticket, it was not immediately introduced at either the national or regional level. Dr Heinen expressed concern that this delay might be just long enough to break some newly-developed green transport habits.\n\nA train passes a railroad crossing surrounded by floodwaters from rain and melting snow in Nidderau near Frankfurt, Germany, Wednesday, Feb. 3, 2021 Credit: AP\n\n3. Public transport is back on the climate agenda\n\nWhether it’s about massive government subsidies for purchasing or producing electric vehicles, or the unending battle surrounding introducing a speed limit to Germany’s famed autobahn highway system, much of the debate around reducing transport emissions in Germany is centred on cars.\n\nDr Heinen told Euronews that she’d welcome a shift in focus away from technical innovations in cars towards a push to change larger transport habits.\n\n“I hope it has changed the discourse. Because there’s been a lot of focus on technical improvements. If you want to encourage public transport, subsidising [ticket cost] is definitely one way to go, the other is improving service, which is better in some areas than others,” she said.\n\nNow that the €9 ticket’s extreme popularity has captured the public imagination, and debate about its extension has been ever-present in recent political discourse, mass transport and its role in reducing emissions are at the fore.\n\nStill, Dr Heinen points out that in order to reach its climate goals, Germany might have to do more than simply make public transport more appealing.\n\n“There’s also a lot of offering more choice and hoping that will result in people making the best decision,\" she told Euronews.\n\n\"That alone doesn’t reduce CO2 emissions.\n\n\"I think if you really want to reduce emissions, unfortunately, you need some measures that push people away from the car.”\n\nA train passes flowers near the rails in Frankfurt, Germany, early Wednesday, June 23, 2021 Credit: AP\n\n4. Germany can skip bureaucracy when it wants to\n\nBureaucracy is deeply entrenched in German society and while Kafkaesque quests to find the right stamp for paperwork can be a borderline-comic inconvenience, thick ribbons of red tape can have serious implications on policy implementation.\n\nEhl has experienced this first-hand at the policy level. When Mobility for All lobbied for a state-wide ticket affordable to recipients of social assistance in Rhineland-Palatinate, even supportive politicians and transport policymakers claimed having one ticket for all five transit authorities in the state was simply unrealistic.\n\n“Then, boom, you get the €9 ticket, which hadn’t even been on the political agenda before,\" he told Euronews.\n\n\"But it proved that you could have a Germany-wide ticket with just a couple of months of preparation. And it showed what’s possible when the political will is there,” he told Euronews.\n\nFor three glorious months, the same, easy-to-order ticket worked everywhere in the country. The time spent staring at transport maps, wondering if you would cross an inner-state border and need an additional ticket, was simply obliterated. It wasn’t just that the ticket was extremely affordable, or that you could take it anywhere. It was also incredibly simple to use.\n\n“I think convenience is an element that hasn’t been discussed as much. It’s not just down to price. If we think about the major aspects that shape why people adopt certain modes of travel, time, effort, and costs are major aspects,” said Dr Heinen.\n\nWhile the national government mulls a successor initiative, some local governments are introducing their own reduced ticket schemes. Berlin, which is launching a city-wide €29 monthly ticket from October to December to act as a bridge until a national ticket is offered again, will help reduce the financial weight of local travel. But the second that riders leave the ticket’s jurisdiction, they will once again be faced with the headache of sorting another ticket for the same ride.\n\n5. The state can help if the political will is there\n\nLike much of Europe, Germany is facing a cost-of-living crisis, with heating and gas prices spiking just as the country prepares for winter. While German politics in recent decades has often been marked by belt-tightening, highlighted by the introduction of a constitutionally-mandated balanced budget in 2009, the €2.5 billion transport ticket initiative shows Germany is capable of big spending to ease economic pain.\n\nAccording to a study by the German Economic Institute, a private research institute in Cologne, inflation in Germany would have been 2% higher without the €9 ticket. With a successful model for staving off inflation, Germans know the state can provide help when there is adequate political will.\n\nRising costs are likely to affect public transport providers as well, only exacerbating the situation.\n\n“A big risk for public transport are rising energy costs. You don’t want to know how big energy bills are for these public transport providers. So there’s the question of who will pay for that,” Dr Heinen said to Euronews.\n\nDer Spiegel has reported Munich’s local transport authority is planning to raise ticket prices by 6.9%, while Deutsche Bahn is contending with €2 billion in rising energy costs and is likely to announce price hikes starting next year.\n\nThose prices may get shunted onto the German state instead of passed down to transit riders. The German government has announced it is planning to bring back a reduced-price, national rail ticket, albeit at a significantly higher price – somewhere between €49 and €69.\n\n“For anyone who already has a rail pass and pays €90 or €100 a month, even a €69 ticket would bring a lot of savings,” said Ehl.\n\n“We see anything that encourages public transport use as positive,” he continued. “But we don’t see it as fair if every household, regardless of income, pays the same for a ticket. There are a lot of people who can’t afford a €49 ticket.”\n\nPaying around €60 for a monthly ticket might not feel like a bargain when many have gotten used to the €9 price point. Germans now know that what was once an inconceivably cheap ticket is a real possibility. And with expenses only expected to keep climbing this winter, they also know that the state can help fight inflation when it wants to.\n\nLessons learned?\n\nWith Spain adopting a free transport programme to close out the year and plenty of other European countries weighing similar initiatives on both the national and local level, it seems other countries have learned from Germany’s €9 ticket experience.\n\nWhile the lessons from the ambitious experiment are clear, it’s not as obvious just how many of them Germany will heed. That’s what will determine whether millions in Germany took part in a grand, once-in-a-lifetime experiment this summer, or if they helped shape the future of German transport.",

    "Germany signals willingness to take in Russians fleeing Ukraine war conscription": "Several German government ministers have indicated that under specific conditions, Germany is ready to take in Russians fleeing the \"partial military mobilization\" ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"Deserters threatened with serious repression can, as a rule, obtain international protection in Germany,\" Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said in an interview with the daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.\n\n\"Anyone who courageously opposes Putin's regime and thereby falls into great danger, can file for asylum on grounds of political persecution,\" she said.\n\nGerman Justice Minister Marco Buschmann tweeted using the hashtag \"partial mobilization\" that \"apparently, many Russians are leaving their homeland — anyone who hates Putin's path and loves liberal democracy is welcome in Germany.\"\n\nMeanwhile, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock praised Russian anti-war protesters and added that no one inside the country can continue turning a blind eye to what's happening in Ukraine because \"every Russian is now going to be at risk of being drafted into this war.\"\n\nGerman Bundestag parliamentarian Robin Wagener of the Greens told DW that it has always been a \"cause of the West to open borders to those fleeing from regimes,\" like those seen in the former Soviet Union.\n\n\"When I hear [Ukrainian] President Zelenskyy saying saying directly to Russian young men, 'protest against the regime, fight it or flee.' Then there needs to be a place to flee to,\" he said.\n\nWagener added that under European law, persons fleeing from military service, when this military service is also linked to war crimes, have the right to asylum.\n\n\"We should keep to that and have our arms open for those fleeing,\" he said.\n\nRussia cracks down on protests against mobilization\n\nRussia denies exodus of young men\n\nOn Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov downplayed reports of draft-age men from Russia fleeing en masse after Putin's announcement.\n\n\"The information about the hype at airports and so on is very much exaggerated. ... There is a lot of fake information about this. We need to be very careful about this so as not to become a victim of false information on this matter,\" he said.\n\nSince Putin declared a \"partial mobilization\" of reservists, flights for the coming days from Russia to visa-free countries including Armenia, Turkey, Azerbaijan and Serbia have sold out entirely. Lengthy lines were reported at Russia's borders with Georgia, Finland, Kazakhstan and Mongolia.\n\nProAsyl calls for admission of deserters\n\nThe German-based human rights organization Pro Asyl also called for countries to grant asylum to deserters and conscientious objectors from Russia and Belarus.\n\n\"According to EU law, those who escape a war that violates international law have a right to asylum and protection. In this sense, Germany and Europe must now unbureaucratically organize the admission of the people who vote with their feet against the Russian war of aggression,\" the head of the European department of Pro Asyl, Karl Kopp, told the Rheinische Post newspaper.\n\nSince February 24, Germany has taken in around 1 million Ukrainians fleeing Russia's invasion, but also welcomed Russian dissidents. According to Faeser, 438 Russian dissidents, including journalists, have also benefited from an accelerated process to obtain protection in Germany.\n\nHowever, she pointed out that political asylum is not automatically granted; applicants are first subjected to security checks.\n\nThe European Commission also said people fleeing partial mobilization in Russia have the right to claim asylum in the European Union. \"This is an unprecedented situation,\" Anita Hipper, an EU spokesperson responsible for migration said.\n\nAccording to Hipper, the applications would need to be considered on a case-by-case basis. She added that work was ongoing with EU member states to find a joint approach.\n\nOn Wednesday, officials from the EU's Baltic member states said they will not offer refuge to any Russians fleeing Moscow's partial mobilization.\n\nEarlier this week, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania closed their borders to most Russian citizens in response to the wide domestic support in Russia for the war in Ukraine.\n\ndh/wmr (AFP, dpa)\n\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

    "Pressure mounts on Germany’s Scholz to send tanks to Ukraine": "The warning shots are getting closer and louder.\n\nIn a heated parliamentary session on Thursday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz received stark signals from his coalition partners that they expect him to ramp up weapons supplies to Ukraine at what is becoming an increasingly critical inflection point of the war.\n\nWhile his government coalition bought him a little more time in the Bundestag debate and temporarily fended off a critical parliamentary motion expressing a lack of faith in his military support for Ukraine, it is now looking more and more likely Scholz will have to respond to the calls for Europe’s biggest economy to pull its weight when it comes to arming Kyiv more decisively.\n\nWitheringly, opposition lawmaker Florian Hahn from the center-right Christian Social Union fumed that Germany was only “number 18 in the world” when comparing its military aid for Ukraine relative to the economic output. Hahn noted that Estonia was far ahead of Germany in supplying arms instead of keeping them for national defense, “even though they have a direct border with the Russian Federation.”\n\nThe center-right Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU) opposition block had requested a vote on a Bundestag motion that urges the government to “immediately” allow the export of German battle tanks and infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine. That would have been tantamount to a vote of no-confidence in Scholz’s Ukraine strategy, since the chancellor has repeatedly ruled out such deliveries as long as other Western allies don’t deliver similar heavy gear.\n\nThe opposition’s maneuver was particularly dangerous for Scholz and his Social Democratic Party (SPD) because leading politicians from his coalition partners, the Greens and the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP), have also demanded the delivery of German Leopard battle tanks and Marder infantry fighting vehicles.\n\nTiming is now of the essence. Ukraine is appealing for more weapons as it launches bold counter-offensives against the Russian invaders in the east and south of the country, while Russian President Vladimir Putin is vowing to throw hundreds of thousands of new soldiers into the conflict and is holding fake referendums in occupied territories to incorporate them into Russia.\n\nA vote on weapons deliveries in the Bundestag would have risked revealing fatal cracks in the government unity and could even have led to a defeat of Scholz in parliament.\n\nFollowing a heated 50-minute debate, however, the majority of SPD, Greens and FDP lawmakers voted to send the opposition’s motion to the foreign affairs and economic affairs committees for further discussion. That effectively delays a plenary vote on the text for a few weeks.\n\nStill, the government now also faces the risk of renewed pressure next week as the opposition “could request a plenary vote” on another tanks-for-Ukraine motion that the CDU/CSU initially put forward in June but which was also delayed at the time by delegating it to committee level, the CDU’s Roderich Kiesewetter told POLITICO.\n\nThe SPD’s foreign policy spokesperson Nils Schmid argued that Thursday’s delay of the vote was justified because the opposition was merely orchestrating a political attack, hoping to weaken the government’s unity.\n\nScholz, who was not present at the debate, had said in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly in New York on Tuesday that Germany would support Ukraine “with all its might: financially, economically, with humanitarian aid and also with weapons.”\n\nPressure from coalition partners\n\nThe most striking part of Thursday’s debate was the intensity of criticism from within the ranks of Scholz’s own coalition. Senior lawmakers from the Greens and FDP expressed clear disapproval of the chancellor’s position and stressed that they want Germany to send more heavy arms.\n\n“As Free Democrats, we believe that in the current military situation, in which Ukraine is reclaiming its territory, piece by piece, we must supply at least the Fuchs armored transport vehicle and the Marder infantry fighting vehicle — and if the situation requires it, the Leopard main battle tank as well,” said the FDP’s Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, chair of the Bundestag’s defense committee.\n\nCrucially, Strack-Zimmermann cited the “Zeitenwende” — a historic shift in German foreign and security policy that Scholz announced in February in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — to argue that Scholz shouldn’t justify his reluctance to send tanks by arguing that other allies like the U.S. weren’t sending modern tanks to Ukraine either.\n\n“Zeitenwende doesn’t just mean doing more for the German armed forces, it also means taking leadership and not waiting for our partners to take uncomfortable decisions from us,” she said.\n\nThe Greens’ co-leader Omid Nouripour delivered a broadside against concerns among Social Democrats that the delivery of tanks to Ukraine could trigger an “irrational” escalation by Putin — a fear that was most recently expressed by the SPD’s Secretary General Kevin Kühnert.\n\n“There are arguments that I cannot follow,” Nouripour told the Bundestag. “That our weapons would lead to an escalation presupposes that the Russian side needs excuses for escalation. That is grotesque. Of course they don’t need excuses, the aggression is there,” Nouripour said in reference to Putin’s announcement on Wednesday to mobilize up to 300,000 reservists.\n\nSpent cartridges at a former position of Russian troops in the Kharkiv area, Ukraine, September 22, 2022 | Oleksandr Ratushniak/EPA-EFE\n\nMoving up from No. 18\n\nGermany has so far sent 30 Gepard anti-aircraft tanks, 10 Panzerhaubitze 2000 howitzers and three Mars multiple rocket launchers, as well as various lighter weapons, to Ukraine, according to a government list.\n\nFollowing growing pressure at home and from allies, Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht announced last week that Berlin would also send 50 “Dingo” armored vehicles and two more Mars rocket launchers — contradicting her own arguments from a few days earlier that Germany could not spare any further weapons in support of Ukraine.\n\nStill, despite these increases, Johann Wadephul, deputy chair of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group, argued that Germany had a historical and moral obligation to step up its support for Ukraine.\n\n“If, in the light of mass graves in Bucha and Izium, we are serious in saying: ‘Never again! Germany must ensure that something never happens again’ — then we have to go a decisive step further here,” he said.",
    "Can AI stop rare eagles flying into wind turbines in Germany?": "Small in size, sensitive of constitution and with only 130 breeding pairs surviving locally in the wild, the lesser spotted eagle of the Oder delta lives up to its name. In Germany, key questions over the country’s energy future hang on the question of whether artificial intelligence systems can do a better job of spotting the reclusive animal than birdwatchers do.\n\nLesser spotted eagles (named after the drop-shaped spots on their feathers) are fond of riding thermals over many of the flatlands earmarked for a mass expansion of onshore windfarms by a German government under pressure to compensate for a pending loss of nuclear power, coal plants and Russian gas.\n\nBecause lesser spotted eagles in mid-flight are unused to vertical obstacles, and keep their eyes focused on mice, lizard or frog-shaped prey below, conservationists say, they are known to occasionally collide with the rotor blades of wind turbines. German researchers list eight dead specimens found in the vicinity of windfarms since 2002, a small but not insignificant number given the species’ endangered status in the country.\n\nA controversial reform of the federal nature conservation act, pushed through by Olaf Scholz’s coalition government earlier this summer, slashes red tape around building windfarms near nesting sites, but banks on AI-driven “anti-collision systems” as one way to minimise such accidents.\n\nSoftware engineers in Colorado are feeding hundreds of thousands of images of the airborne clanga pomarina into an algorithm. Linked to a camera system perched atop a 10-metre tower, the trained-up neural networks of the US company IdentiFlight are expected to detect eagles approaching from a distance of up to 750 metres and electronically alert the turbine.\n\nThe turbine will then take 20-40 seconds to wind down into “trundle mode” of no more than two rotations each minute, ideally giving the eagle plenty of time to navigate safe passage between its slowly moving blades.\n\nIdentiFlight spent three years testing its anti-collision systems at six supervised sites across Germany, and says its neural network boasts rates of more than 90% for recognising and classifying red kites, the first birds of prey it has been trained in for German territories. While fog, rain or snow can reduce the system’s effectiveness, the makers say, low visibility also decreases the eagles’ appetite for airborne hunting raids.\n\nThe system is expected to detect eagles approaching from a distance of up to 750 metres. Photograph: IdentiFlight\n\nThe system is expected to be certified for spotting sea eagles in the coming weeks, with validation for their lesser spotted relatives scheduled for 2023. “From our point of view, the system could be a good solution,” said Moritz Stubbe, a business manager trying to bring anti-collision systems to German wind parks. “We are waiting for the green light.”\n\nThe technological solution is also meant to solve a political conundrum for the Green party, the second-largest party in the three-way coalition government and driving force behind the new nature protection law. By keeping the peace between those of its supporters who define ecological politics predominantly as safeguarding biodiversity and those who prioritise mitigating the climate crisis.\n\nWind energy in Germany underwent a massive boom after Angela Merkel announced the phase-out of nuclear power in 2011, with windfarms currently providing about a quarter of the country’s electricity needs. But the expansion plans have stalled for the past four years, at about 30,000 turbines providing just over 60,000 megawatt hours a year.\n\nWind power companies complain that planning applications take longer and longer, with not only environmentalists but locals opposed to turbines having learned to use natural protection laws to stymie their plans.\n\nEven before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine upended decades of German energy policy, Scholz’s government had announced its intention to reverse the trend: it has plans to increase electricity from renewables by 80% over the next eight years, and to commit Germany’s 16 federal states to provide 2% of their landmass for wind energy over the next ten. Experts say this would amount to an additional 16,000 turbines by 2030, or 38 a week.\n\nTo reach these targets, Germany’s Green-run environmental ministry has for the first time drawn up a conclusive list of 15 birds it deems at risk of colliding with turbines. Those animals that did not make the list, such as the black stork, cannot be cited to stop a planning application. But even those that did make the grade are now protected to a lesser degree.\n\nWindfarms can in the future be built outside a 1.5km radius around the nest of the lesser spotted eagle, for example, down from 3km. In the north-eastern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, conservation officers said this is likely to affect 10 nesting pairs.\n\nWind park developers may still be obliged to take additional measures to protect the at-risk birds, such as by switching off turbines while fields in the vicinity are being harvested, thus attracting birds of prey on the lookout for newly exposed field mice.\n\nSwitching off turbines for an entire breeding season, however, will no longer be allowed, and rotor blades are not allowed to be kept at standstill if the farm’s energy production is diminished by 4-8% as a result, depending on the location.\n\n“It’s a catastrophe”, said one nature protection officer who did not want to be named, suggesting the legislation was likely to be disputed and thus bog down planning applications rather than unleash turbine builders. Some lawyers argue the new act violates European environmental law; the German Wind Energy Association (BWE) vehemently disagrees. Court action looks predestined.\n\n“As a society, we have to start asking ourselves some basic questions,” said Wolfram Axthelm, BWE’s chief executive. “Do we want to build windfarms because we want to mitigate climate change and protect the environment as a whole? Or do we want to save every individual bird?”\n\nThe number of birds killed by wind turbines, he said, was dwarfed by those that perished after flying into windows, being run over by cars or being caught by domestic cats. “We have to concentrate on the population as a whole.”\n\nClanga pomarina is named after Pomerania, the historical region on the southern shore of the Baltic Sea. In Germany, the lesser spotted eagle’s population has declined by a quarter since the 1990s, not mainly due to wind turbines, but to a gradual disappearance of the woodland-meets-wetland habitats where the birds like to nest.\n\nFurther to the east, in Estonia, Lithuania and Slovakia, the species is still thriving. The International Union for Conservation of Nature red list of threatened species lists the lesser spotted eagle’s global population as stable, with an estimated 40,000-60,000 mature individuals remaining in the wild."
