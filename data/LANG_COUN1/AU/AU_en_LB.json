    "Lebanon parliament passes 2022 budget that falls short of IMF reform": "Sept 26 (Reuters) - Lebanon's parliament passed the 2022 budget on Monday using an exchange rate for customs tax revenues that lies far below the market value of the Lebanese pound, falling short of economic reform measures that would pave the way for an IMF deal.\n\nAn agreement with the lender of last resort is seen as a first crucial step for Lebanon to begin exiting a three-year financial implosion that has left most people poor and plunged the country into its worst crisis since the 1975-90 Civil War.\n\nAn April staff-level agreement between Lebanon's government and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said authorities should increase revenues to fund the crippled public sector and allow for more social spending by calculating customs taxes at a \"unified exchange rate\".\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nBut parliament endorsed a rate of 15,000 pounds to the dollar, while the market rate sat at around 37,000.\n\nOfficials view the approval of a higher exchange rate for imports as a move that would be unpopular in the heavily import-dependent country.\n\nThe budget - adopted with just three months left in the year - calculated expenditures at 41 trillion Lebanese pounds, or just $1.1 billion at the market rate on Monday, and revenues at 30 trillion Lebanese pounds.\n\nIts hard-currency value marks a massive drop from the 2019 budget, the last before the crisis, which was worth more than $16 billion - a result of the depreciation of the Lebanese pound by more than 95% since that year.\n\nThe 2022 budget tripled salaries for all public sector workers, including the army and security forces, many of whom now earn less than the equivalent of $50 per month.\n\nIbrahim Kanaan, a lawmaker who heads parliament's budget committee, told Reuters the back and forth between officials over the customs rate had cost the country valuable time.\n\n\"We spent six months (on the budget)... and up until tonight, they were still dancing between different rates. This is not healthy,\" he said.\n\nThe IMF had no immediate comment.\n\nLast week it noted that progress towards reforms had been \"very slow\" and said delays in approving the 2022 budget meant that focus must now turn to the 2023 budget.\n\n\"This should be based on realistic macroeconomic assumptions, with the necessary revenue raising measures, including the use of a realistic exchange rate... for all tax purposes,\" it said.\n\nSibylle Rizk, director of public policies at advocacy group Kulluna Irada, said the 2022 budget did not put Lebanon on a path towards fiscal accountability, and would not afford the government the funds to invest in key social expenditure.\n\n\"It's an extremely regressive budget in one of the most dire periods for Lebanese society,\" she said.\n\n\"It shows that... Lebanon now has a zombie state. Authorities show no willingness to start key reforms to put the country back on the track of fiscal and debt sustainability and provide basic services to the population,\" she said.\n\nThe government has said the 2022 budget was supposed to be corrective but that the 2023 budget would include deeper reforms.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nReporting by Timour Azhar; Writing by Timour Azhari and Nayera Abdallah; Editing by Grant McCool and Mark Potter\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
    "Lebanon: Syrian Refugee Apparently Tortured to Death": "Click to expand Image Bashar Abed Al Saud © 2022 Private\n\n(Beirut) – Lebanese authorities should transfer the prosecution of security force members charged in the torture and murder of a Syrian refugee from inherently unfair military courts to the ordinary criminal courts, Human Rights Watch, Legal Agenda, Amnesty International, and MENA Rights Group said today.\n\nMembers of State Security, one of Lebanon’s intelligence agencies, allegedly tortured Bashar Abed Al Saud, 30, after his arrest on August 30, 2022. He died from his injuries on August 31. On September 2, after news of Al Saud’s death and photographs of his bruised body circulated in the media, the Military Prosecutor Judge Fadi Akiki, arrested and charged a State Security officer and three other members with torture and referred them to the Military Investigative Judge Najat Abu Shaqra. They are being investigated in the military justice system, which lacks independence and includes judges appointed by the defense minister.\n\n“Al Saud’s death during his detention at State Security requires a fair and comprehensive investigation in front of the ordinary judiciary, as the military justice system cannot bring justice for his family,” said Ghida Frangieh, head of litigation at Legal Agenda.\n\nOn September 8, Al Saud’s family submitted a torture complaint to the Cassation Public Prosecution through their lawyer Mohammad Sablouh. The prosecutor, Judge Ghassan Oueidat, referred the case as a violation of Lebanon’s anti-torture law to the military prosecutor. On September 15, Al Saud’s relatives resubmitted a request to refer the file to the ordinary criminal courts, but Judge Oueidat also referred that request to the military prosecutor.\n\nReferring the investigation to the military court is contrary to international law, as interpreted by treaty bodies, and article 15 of Lebanon’s Code of Criminal Procedure, which states that crimes that members of the judicial police commit while carrying out their duties as assistants to the public prosecution fall solely under the jurisdiction of the ordinary judiciary.\n\nFurther, Lebanon’s 2017 anti-torture law also states in its preamble that the regular judiciary alone “has the power to prosecute, investigate, and try” crimes of torture, “excluding any other exceptional criminal courts.” When debating the anti-torture bill in September 2017, Parliament members agreed that there was no need to include this explicitly in the proposed law in light of article 15 of the criminal procedure code.\n\nThe jurisdiction of ordinary criminal courts over torture complaints is fundamental to ensuring that victims of crimes under international law, like torture, or human rights violations have the right to an effective remedy, the organizations said. The structure of the military judicial system in Lebanon and its legal procedures mean that security force personnel will not be prosecuted before a competent, independent, and impartial court.\n\nMost military court judges are military and security services officers, appointed by the defense minister, and are not required to have a law degree or legal training. Human rights organizations and the media cannot monitor military trials without prior permission from the presiding judge. In addition, the Military Justice Law does not allow victims to participate in the trial, and at most considers them potential witnesses.\n\nA member of Al Saud’s family told the organizations that at around 8 p.m. on August 30, about six or seven security agents wearing military clothing arrested Al Saud at his home in the Shatila camp in Beirut, without identifying their agency or saying why he was being arrested. They did not present a judicial arrest order, the relative said.\n\nAl Saud’s relative and Sablouh, his lawyer, said that Al Saud was not allowed to call his family or have a lawyer present during his interrogation, in violation of his due process rights under international law and Lebanon’s Code of Criminal Procedure. His relative said that they did not know Al Saud’s whereabouts until they received a call on September 3 telling them to collect his body from the Tebneen Public Hospital in south Lebanon.\n\nThe authorities had transferred Al Saud to the Nabatieh hospital in south Lebanon at around 7 a.m. on August 31, where a forensic report that the organizations reviewed found that Al Saud died as a result of “the stoppage of the central nervous system due intense pain and suffering from violence and severe beatings, which ultimately led to the stopping of his heart and blood circulation.” The forensic report also stated that the doctor found:\n\nblueness and redness in the head near the left ear, a bleeding wound on the right side of the lower lip, remnants of blood in the nostrils, signs of several burns all over the body, many signs indicating the use of a whip or an electric wire in the upper extremities, back, chest, abdomen and lower extremities up to the feet, and swelling in the testicles.\n\nPhotographs and a video of Al Saud’s body, which the organizations reviewed, corroborate the forensic report, and show large parts of his body covered in bruises, whip marks, cuts, and burns.\n\nOn September 2, a Lebanese newspaper Al Akhbar publicized the news of Al Saud’s alleged torture and death, prompting State Security to issue a statement claiming that its forces had arrested Al Saud after members of an Islamic State (ISIS) cell identified him as an accomplice, and that Al Saud had confessed to fighting with ISIS. The statement conceded that Al Saud had died, but it did not address the torture allegations and stated that the agency had referred the case to the “competent judiciary.”\n\nOn September 5, State Security released another statement accusing some media outlets of “slandering” the agency and stating that the file had been transferred to the military judiciary and that maximum penalties would be imposed against anyone found to have violated orders.\n\nHuman Rights Watch wrote to State Security and the Cassation Public Prosecutor, copying the military prosecutor, on September 6, asking for clarification around the scope of State Security’s mandate in policing suspected terrorism cases and its detention authority; the circumstances and legality of Al Saud’s arrest and detention; and any action that State Security or the prosecution had taken to investigate, suspend, or discipline any State Security member involved in the arrest, interrogation, or alleged torture and ill-treatment of Al Saud. As of September 26, Human Rights Watch has not received a response.\n\nMENA Rights Group submitted Al Saud’s case to several United Nations human rights experts, including the Special Rapporteur on Torture, the Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions, and the Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers.\n\nThe Cassation Public Prosecution has previously referred torture complaints to the military judiciary in apparent violation of the law. This includes a torture complaint that the actor Ziad Itani submitted in October 2018 against members of State Security, as well as torture complaints from 17 protesters against the security forces in December 2019 in the context of Lebanon’s nationwide protests. The military prosecutor and cassation public prosecutor agreed in April 2019 to transfer Itani’s complaint to the ordinary courts. No one has been charged in these cases.\n\n“Impunity for torture remains commonplace, with dozens of complaints regarding torture and other ill-treatment filed under the 2017 Anti-Torture Law rarely reaching court and most closed without an effective investigation,” said Diana Semaan, Amnesty International’s Acting Deputy Director for the Middle East and North Africa. “It is about time that the Lebanese authorities begin to implement the anti-torture law, investigate all allegations of torture and other ill-treatment, and hold the perpetrators accountable.”\n\nThe Lebanese authorities should seriously investigate complaints related to crimes of torture and respect the jurisdiction of regular courts over these crimes, the organizations said. The public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation, the government commissioner at the military court, and the military investigative judge should immediately transfer the file about the investigation into Al Saud’s death to the competent and ordinary criminal judge, the investigative judge in the south, to ensure compliance with Lebanese law and the right of his relatives to an effective remedy.\n\nFurther, Lebanon should allocate funds to allow the five members of the National Preventative Mechanism against Torture, who were appointed in July 2019, to fulfill their mandate.\n\n“The shocking images of Al Saud’s bruised and gashed body should send a strong message to the Lebanese authorities that they need to be doing much more to combat torture in detention,” said Aya Majzoub, Lebanon researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Those responsible for Al Saud’s torture and death should be brought to justice in fair and transparent judicial proceedings.”",
    "Daily blackouts put Lebanon’s ancient artefacts at risk": "Electricity – in short supply in Lebanon – is needed to preserve many of the National Museum of Beirut’s priceless archaeological treasures.\n\nBeirut, Lebanon – The severe power shortages plaguing Lebanon are not only hitting homes and private institutions, but are also affecting major cultural centres and putting priceless exhibits at risk.\n\nThe National Museum of Beirut experienced even worse blackouts than usual over two weeks in August, receiving only one or two hours a day of state-provided electricity, with no funds for generator fuel.\n\nFootage shot by tourist Mariella Rubio that showed visitors viewing the museum’s archaeological wonders by phone flashlight made waves on social media.\n\n“The experience was paradoxical, because of course seeing the museum completely blacked out was sad – it was the perfect metaphor for the whole country – but at the same time, I have to admit that the feeling of being in the museum in that situation was somehow magical in a twisted way,” Rubio told Al Jazeera.\n\n“They didn’t charge us or any of the visitors because of the absence of light,” she said. “It gave me the opportunity not only to enjoy the museum in a different way, but to also have a perfect comprehension of what the real situation of the country, economy and energy system is like.”\n\nEl Museo Nacional de Beirut completamente a oscuras por la enorme crisis energética que asola el país. Los visitantes tienen que hacer la visita con linternas. Piezas de incalculable valor arqueológico en absoluta oscuridad (Hilo) pic.twitter.com/buG5IrMVlt — Mariela Rubio (@marielarubio) August 9, 2022\n\nThe Culture Ministry says it has resolved the situation for now by providing the museum with funds to buy generator fuel, which is essential for protecting the exhibits requiring climate control.\n\nBut while the situation may be stable for now, when the funds run out, a new plan will be needed to secure the museum’s survival.\n\nOpening hours have been restricted to cut down on fuel consumption.\n\nLike most businesses and institutions in Lebanon, the museum faces challenges because of the economic meltdown that began in 2019. Blackouts are a daily occurrence in Lebanon now, with state power providing only one hour a day in most areas.\n\n“You have to fight and to continue – especially because, despite the lack of electricity, we had between 150 and 250 people visiting daily,” museum director Anne-Marie Afeiche told Al Jazeera.\n\n“We are dealing with problems like everyone – with the [salaries of the] guards, the employees, issues paying for the maintenance or cleaning – but we are still standing,” she added.\n\n“Like the country, we don’t know what will happen tomorrow.”\n\n‘This is our treasure, our heritage’\n\nOpened in 1942, Lebanon’s principal archaeology museum currently displays about 1,300 artefacts from a collection of 100,000 pieces ranging from prehistoric times to the Roman, Phoenician, Byzantine, and Mamluk periods.\n\nFor the museum’s stone objects, climate control is not an issue.\n\nBut for items such as frescoes, mummies and textile, metal or organic artefacts like Bronze Age weaponry and Roman leather armour, temperature and humidity control – and therefore power – is essential.\n\nAfeiche said the museum is closely monitoring sensitive objects for damage or changes.\n\n“These collections cannot be replaced. This is our treasure, our heritage, and we have to take care of it in the best way.”\n\nShe said it is often the fluctuations between hot and cold and wet and dry caused by blackouts that pose the biggest dangers.\n\n“So really, we dodged the bullet, as it was only two weeks with very bad power situation and now things are better.”\n\nThe International Alliance for the Protection of Heritage in Conflict Areas (ALIPH) has been working with the museum since the 2020 Beirut port blast, pledging $5m to aid cultural institutions and monuments damaged in the explosion or threatened by the country’s challenges.\n\nThe museum’s generators were damaged in the blast and are still not fully repaired. The power situation in Lebanon has only worsened since the port blast, amid a plummeting currency and skyrocketing fuel prices.\n\nIn November 2021, ALIPH provided $15,000 for fuel purchases, to ease the pressing power issues.\n\nWhen those funds ran out and the museum was once again without regular power, ALIPH reassessed the situation and approved a grant of $130,000 in February 2022 to be used for solar power installation, to be implemented by Paris’s Louvre Museum in coordination with Lebanon’s General Directorate of Antiquities (DGA).\n\n“It’s a necessity and we know how much the DGA is struggling with preserving the objects and keeping the museum at certain levels, in terms of temperature and humidity,” ALIPH project manager David Sassine told Al Jazeera.\n\n“The most favourable [scenario] is to keep any object in very stable conditions, [otherwise] ageing of these elements will be catalysed in a big way.\n\n“Instead of restoring the generators when it’s unsure that there will be enough fuel supply, we chose a more sustainable approach focusing on renewable energy to make sure the museum is autonomous in terms of the power supply.”\n\nDespite the urgency of the project, the solar panels cannot be installed until the council of ministers officially approves the grant and all the technical aspects are mapped out.\n\nSassine believes that the approval will be signed soon and the panels may be installed by December, but ultimately the timeline rests on the expediency of the Lebanese government.\n\nALIPH has now approved another grant of $15,000 for fuel, to help keep generators on until the solar system can be installed.\n\nIn the meantime, the DGA and the Ministry of Finance decided in September to raise entry prices for all museums and archaeological sites managed by the government to generate more income for maintenance and other expenses.\n\nThe museum will have to rely on locals with access to dollars or tourists and expats to keep afloat, especially with the influx of visitors into Lebanon in recent months.\n\nAfeiche says the museum relies primarily on income from the museum’s shop and other facilities for most maintenance and cleaning expenses.\n\n“The National Heritage Foundation built an extension to the museum [in 2020], which will eventually be inaugurated with a cafeteria,” she added.\n\n“It’s always the [shop], the restaurants and the cafeteria that helps the museum sustain [itself]. It’s not very often that ticketing is the main income.”\n\nThe extension, which had its inauguration delayed due to the pandemic, does not have an official opening date yet. Afeiche is optimistic that, with the addition of a café and the solar power installation, the National Museum will thrive once more and safeguard Lebanon’s historical treasures.\n\nThe museum hopes to make the most of an uptick in tourism this year, with COVID restrictions worldwide easing and the devaluation of the Lebanese pound, including a lot of expats.\n\n“We had a lot of Lebanese visiting and I’m always very proud when they do, because these Lebanese often live abroad and when they come back to see the family, they feel like coming to the National Museum, with their friends or friends coming with them,” Afeiche said.\n\n“It’s very important to give back the sense of national pride and heritage that they have.”",

(AP Photo/Bilal Hussein)\n\nBEIRUT -- Lebanese army retirees scuffled with parliamentary guard troops as they briefly broke through a cordon leading to Parliament in downtown Beirut during a rally Monday. They were protesting their decimated monthly pay amid the country's economic meltdown.\n\nThe troops managed to push the crowd back and fired teargas, forcing the elderly retirees to turn away from the street. After a short while, they gathered nearby to continue their protest and demand higher pay. They later dispersed.\n\nHours after the protest, Parliament passed the 2022 budget, a key demand by the International Monetary Fund, with 63 legislators voting in favor, 37 voting against and six abstaining. The new budget will calculate customs tax revenue at 15,000 Lebanese pounds to the dollar at a time when the black market rate is more than double that at about 37,000 pounds to the dollar. Since the meltdown began three years ago, the customs tax revenue was calculated at the official rate of 1,500 pounds to the dollar.\n\nAccording to the new budget, government expenditures stand at 40.9 trillion pounds ($1.1 billion) at the parallel market rate, while revenue stands at 30 trillion pounds ($810 million). The government also approved a 200% salary increase to civil servants and civilian and military retirees on condition that their monthly income does not exceed 12 million pounds ($324).\n\nThe rally came as banks in this crisis-hit Lebanon partially reopened Monday following a weeklong closure amid a wave of heists in which assailants stormed at least seven bank branches earlier this month, demanding to withdraw their trapped savings. The Association of Banks in Lebanon had said last Monday it was going on strike amid bank holdups by depositors and activists.\n\nPublic sector workers and retired officers and soldiers frequently protest in Lebanon, demanding better wages and pensions. However, scuffles with active officers are a sign of the ongoing meltdown and growing chaos in the tiny Mideast nation.\n\nLebanon’s cash-strapped banks had last closed for a prolonged period back in October 2019, for two weeks, during mass anti-government protests triggered by the crisis. That year, the banks imposed strict limits on cash withdrawals, tying up the savings of millions of people.\n\nThe country’s economy has since spiraled, with about three-quarters of the population plunged into poverty. The Lebanese pound has lost over 90% of its value against the dollar.\n\nThe frustrations boiled over this month, with angry and desperate depositors — including one armed with a hunting rifle — started holding up the banks. One of them, Sali Hafez, broke into a Beirut bank branch with a fake pistol and retrieved some $13,000 in her savings to cover her sister’s cancer treatment.\n\nHowever, only a handful of bank branches opened Monday — accepting only customers with prior appointments for corporate transactions. The partial reopening was to continue indefinitely, until banks can secure the safety of their employees.\n\nCrowds of anxious Lebanese gathered around ATM machines.\n\n“I've been here for three hours, and they won't let me in or schedule an appoint,” Fadi Al-Osta told The Associated Press outside a bank branch in Beirut. “The security guards can let us in one at a time and check for weapons. Isn't that their job?”\n\nGeorge al-Hajj, president of Lebanon's Federation of Bank Employees Syndicates, said branches have downsized, to have a larger number of security guards per branch.\n\n“Our goal isn't to harm anyone, but we want to go to work feeling safe and secure,” al-Hajj said. “We're also human beings.\"\n\nTensions were simmering in the southern city of Sidon, where State Security forces armed with assault rifles stood outside some bank branches. Some police officers and army soldiers, whose salaries have lost over 90% of their value, unsuccessfully tried to break into a bank branch to collect small cash bonus recently granted by the government.\n\nDepositors' Outcry, a protest group that has supported bank heists to retrieve savings, said Monday it was committed to a “war on the banks” but that it had also called for a meeting with the bankers to find solutions so that “depositors can live with dignity.\"\n\n“We will continue organizing actions, including strong actions that will target and shock the banks,” said the group’s media coordinator, Moussa Agassi.\n\nLebanon's talks with the International Monetary Fund on a bailout have progressed sluggishly, with authorities failing to implement critical reforms, including restructuring the banking sector and lifting banking secrecy laws. Last week, a visiting IMF delegation criticized the government’s slowness to implement desperately-needed financial reforms.",
    "Lebanon: US proposal for maritime border deal with Israel to be sent by end of week": "An American proposal to resolve a maritime border dispute between Israel and Lebanon is expected to be sent to Lebanese President Michel Aoun in the coming days, his office said Monday.\n\nAccording to a statement posted to Twitter by the Lebanese presidency, US mediator Amos Hochstein’s written offer of a border demarcation will arrive at Aoun’s desk before the end of the week.\n\nThe statement also said the deputy speaker of Lebanon’s parliament, Elias Bou Saab, briefed Aoun on his recent talks with Hochstein in New York.\n\nNo details were provided about the expected proposal.\n\nThe maritime dispute relates to some 860 square kilometers (330 square miles) of the Mediterranean Sea that include lucrative offshore gas fields.\n\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms\n\nThe US-brokered talks on rights to the area, the subject of long-running negotiations between Jerusalem and Beirut and repeated threats from the Hezbollah terror group, have appeared to make progress in recent weeks.\n\nOn Sunday, Israel’s Channel 13 news said security officials believe a deal will be reached in the next two weeks.\n\nThe television report followed talks Prime Minister Yair Lapid held on preparations to produce gas from the Karish field, amid Hezbollah threats to attack Israel if it begins drilling there before a maritime border deal is reached.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah said last week that his Iran-backed terror organization’s missiles were “locked on” Karish.\n\nLebanon claims that the Karish gas field is in disputed territory, while Israel says it lies within its internationally recognized economic waters.\n\nEarlier this month, Lapid’s office vowed Israel would go ahead and extract gas from Karish with or without a deal on the maritime border with Lebanon. Those comments came hours after Aoun said that indirect talks with Israel to end a maritime border dispute are in their “final stages.”\n\nA spokesperson for Lapid issued a statement later that day saying: “Israel believes that it is both possible and necessary to reach an agreement on a maritime line between Lebanon and Israel, in a manner that will serve the interests of the citizens of both countries.”",

Unicef said 10 children appeared to be among the dead.\n\nFamilies in Lebanon held a second day of funerals on Saturday after they were handed bodies of relatives on Friday night through the Arida border crossing with Syria. Others still await the bodies of their relatives.\n\nIn Tripoli, anger mixed with grief as relatives received news of the death of loved ones.

It comes at a time when the small Mediterranean nation is in desperate need amid an unprecedented economic meltdown.\n\nUkraine is one of the world’s major global grain suppliers but the war has blocked most exports. This led world food prices to soar in a crisis, including in Lebanon. The Lebanese are heavily reliant on Ukraine grain products, which accounted for 60% of Lebanon's supply.\n\nIn early August, a Syrian ship that Ukraine said was carrying stolen Ukrainian grain left Tripoli after officials in Lebanon allowed it to sail following an investigation. The Syrian-flagged Laodicea had been anchored in Tripoli for days, with 10,000 tons of wheat flour and barley.

Now they are in a new life. I hope it's much better than this one here.\"\n\nThe tragedy has underscored soaring poverty in northern Lebanon, and Tripoli in particular, that is driving ever more people to take desperate measures three years into the country's devastating financial collapse.\n\nIt has also brought into focus stark inequalities that are particularly acute in the north: Tripoli is home to a number of ultra-rich politicians but has enjoyed little in the way of development or investment.\n\nWhile many of Lebanon’s sectarian leaders have spent money in their communities to shore up political support, residents in Tripoli say their area has been neglected despite the wealth of its politicians.\n\nAs mourners gathered to pay their respects in Tripoli's impoverished Bab al-Ramel neighbourhood, many voiced anger at the city's politicians including Najib Mikati, Lebanon's billionaire tycoon prime minister.\n\n\"We're in a country where politicians just suck up money, talk, and have no regard for what people need,\" El Maneh said.\n\nTripoli, Lebanon's second city with a population of roughly half a million, was already Lebanon's poorest before the country plummeted into financial crisis, the result of decades of corruption and bad governance overseen by ruling elites.\n\nMohanad Hage Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Center said Tripoli had seen no major development efforts since the 1975-90 civil war despite the political rise of rich businessmen from the city.

    "The race for Lebanon's next president": "Analysis: Plagued by political fragmentation and an economic crisis, Lebanon's upcoming presidential election has yet to produce a consensus candidate that can unite the country.\n\n\n\nThe new parliament formed in May is preparing to elect the next president of the Lebanese Republic, who will be in charge for the next six years.\n\nPresident Michel Aoun is expected to leave office by 31st October, and the election of a new president represents a crucial test bed for political parties to gauge alliances and outline the political direction of the country.\n\nBy convention, the president of Lebanon is a Christian Maronite, and the main responsibility is to serve as a symbol of the nation's unity. The presidency plays an active role in the country's political life as it can exercise several prerogatives before, during, and after the formation of the government.\n\nIn parliament, a president is elected by way of a secret ballot and a two-thirds majority in the first session, with an absolute majority in subsequent rounds. This election of the incoming Lebanese president comes amid the most critical moment of Lebanon's post-civil war history.\n\n\"No political bloc gained a substantial majority in the general elections held in May, and the parliamentary fragmentation hasn't helped in the search for a consensus candidate\"\n\nPolitical instability, corruption, and an ongoing multidimensional economic crisis that erupted in late 2019 have torn apart the country's social fabric, making a recovery for any government tough.\n\nPrime Minister-designate Najib Mikati has yet to form a government, and his lineup of ministries presented to President Aoun didn't convince the latter to give the green light for establishing the new cabinet, although Mikati has made assurances in recent days that the new government is set to be formed before President Aoun's term ends.\n\nNo political bloc gained a substantial majority in the general elections held in May, and the parliamentary fragmentation hasn’t helped in the search for a consensus candidate.\n\nIn the last few weeks, several names started to circulate that could be potential candidates at Baabda Palace, the official residence of the President of Lebanon, although no political party has yet endorsed an official candidate. The goal of major political parties is to find a common candidate able to receive consensus.\n\nThe two major Christian Maronite parties, the Free Patriotic Movement (FPM), founded by incumbent President Aoun and led by his son-in-law Gebran Bassil, and the Lebanese Forces (LF), led by Samir Geagea, are likely to be confrontational over the competition for the next president.\n\nSeveral local newspapers named both Bassil and Geagea as potential candidates, although some experts argue that they have little chance of assuming the role. Nevertheless, it is necessary for any candidate who wants to run for the presidency to receive political endorsements from one or both Christian Maronite parties.\n\nThe endorsement of the presidential candidate from one or both major Christian Maronite parties is necessary to have political legitimacy and may be decisive in understanding the strength of foreign political influence in the country.\n\nThe FPM is allied with Iran-backed Hezbollah, while Geagea's LF takes an anti-Hezbollah position and is widely seen as Saudi Arabia's main Lebanese ally.\n\nSami Nader, political analyst and Director of Levant Institute for Strategic Affairs (LISA), explained to The New Arab that Lebanese presidents elected since the end of the civil war had allied with different regional powers.\n\nLebanese President Michel Aoun sits between Prime Minister Najib Mikati and Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri during a ceremony marking the 78th anniversary of Lebanon's Independence Day in Beirut on 22 November 2021. [Getty]\n\n\"What will be the share of the Iranian and the anti-Iranian camp? I don't think Geagea or Bassil can be elected because the degree of opposition of other camps is thick. Geagea has an excessive anti-Iranian stance, while Bassil is under US sanctions,\" he said.\n\nBut beyond unofficial candidates Geagea and Bassil, other names are popping up.\n\nSuleman Antoine Frangieh, current President of the Christian Maronite party the Marada Movement, and grandson of the former Lebanese President Suleiman Kalaman Frangieh, is seen as a suitable solution to find common ground between parties, although he is considered affiliated with the 8th of March alliance, which is allied with Hezbollah.\n\nImad Salamey, associate professor of Political Science and International Affairs at the Lebanese American University (LAU), told The New Arab that Frangieh has a high chance of being endorsed.\n\n\"Frangieh has a kind of international consensus [...] however, he should ensure sufficient support, particularly from the FPM, securing the party at least one-third of the future government. But in this scenario, he may face opposition from other parties. He could also be elected without the support of the FPM and by being supported by the LF. This would be a better choice because the international community will support such a choice, but this is hard to achieve,\" he said.\n\n\"Possible scenarios for the presidential election also include President Aoun remaining in office if a government is not formed before the end of his term\"\n\nHowever, Hezbollah is the party that still has the upper hand in the Presidential election.\n\nEven though in May's elections it obtained fewer seats than in previous general elections, it still retains most of the parliamentary seats with its ally, the Amal Movement. The Iran-backed Shia party said it is open to a consensus president and seems to be playing for time in officially endorsing any candidate.\n\nMichael Young, a senior editor at the Malcolm H. Kerr Carnegie Middle East Centre, told The New Arab that both Hezbollah and Amal are waiting for a candidate that can bring consensus.\n\n\"They are avoiding endorsing someone because they want to find a candidate upon whom everyone can agree,\" he said.\n\nIn the meantime, the Progressive Socialist Party (PSP) 's leader Walid Jumblatt met in August with Hezbollah officials to discuss several domestic issues, signalling a possible political rapprochement between the two parties that could have an impact on the presidential election.\n\nSalamey explained that Jumblatt is playing matchmaker, trying to forge an alliance between the LF and Hezbollah and Amal's political bloc.\n\n\"Despite the rhetoric, both opponents have been working together in previous governments and are in the same parliament today, working together in parliamentary committees,\" he said.\n\nNader said that Jumblatt could be the kingmaker in consultations to nominate a presidential candidate as his party can vote for both anti- or pro-Iranian candidates, while other political camps are vertically divided.\n\nYoung highlighted that although Frangieh considers himself a compromising candidate, not every party shares the same view.\n\n\"Both the FPM and LF don't consider him a consensus candidate. However, their position could be tactical because what they want to do is grasp if they can influence him to impose their conditions on him. For instance, Bassil may ask him to name a new commander of the Army, a new governor of the central bank, and obtain control over certain ministries,\" he said.\n\nA man holding a photo of Hassan Nasrallah, leader of Hezbollah at the Hezbollah Political Party Rally on 13 May 2022 ahead of the parliamentary elections. [Getty]\n\nIn August, Ziad Hayek, former secretary general of the High Council for Privatisation and Partnerships (HCPP) and current resident of the World Association of PP Units and Professionals, and Tracy Chamoun, Lebanon's former Ambassador to Jordan and granddaughter of former President Camille Chamoun, officially presented their presidential candidacy.\n\nAccording to Young, other personalities, such as Neemat Frem, a politician and businessman, Jihad Azour, the Director of the Middle East and Central Asia Department at the International Monetary Fund, and General Joseph Aoun, commander of the Lebanese Army, may emerge as consensus candidates, although they don't have a political base inside the parliament.\n\n\"I consider General Aoun one of the most realistic options, but several conditions need to be implemented. To be elected, it would be necessary to change part of the constitution because a civil servant can be a candidate only if they have retired two years before the candidacy. However, that part of the constitution is open to more interpretations as that wasn't applied when Michel Suleiman became President in 2008,\" he said.\n\nHowever, possible scenarios for the presidential election also include President Aoun remaining in office if a government is not formed before his term ends.\n\n\"He hasn't been a national unifier and divided the nation. Everyone looks at Aoun's presidency as a big failure\"\n\nIn 2016, Lebanon experienced an extended power vacuum when the parliament took more than two years and 46 rounds to elect Aoun as president, during which time the government assumed presidential duties.\n\nNader explained that Aoun could manoeuvre the presidential election, saying that if there is no official government he will not leave office because a caretaker government cannot assume presidential duties.\n\n\"However, I don't think this is a likely scenario because international stakeholders will oppose it,\" he said, adding that there is disagreement over the constitutional interpretation on this matter.\n\n\"A caretaker government with presidential powers may not be considered legitimate by Aounist ministers, who may decide not to participate in it,\" he said.\n\nFor now, a potential candidate still needs to secure the endorsement of the FPM or the LF, which are currently trying to block each other's initiatives.\n\n\"How can you convince the two largest Christian Maronite blocs to support a third candidate, and at what condition? FPM and LF would support a third candidate if this would be committed to strengthening the political positions of those parties,\" Young said.\n\nAsked about Aoun's legacy during his presidency, Young told The New Arab it had been a disaster.\n\n\"What Aoun did in the last three years has been trying to secure the election of his son-in-law to power, but he failed. This shows he wasn't looking for a legacy but behaved like any member of the political class by putting in power someone from his family. He hasn't been a national unifier and divided the nation. Everyone looks at Aoun's presidency as a big failure,\" he said.\n\nDario Sabaghi is a freelance journalist interested in human rights.\n\nFollow him on Twitter: @DarioSabaghi",
    "Maritime gas dispute risks conflict between Lebanon and Israel": "Beirut, Lebanon – Karish is a relatively small untapped gasfield in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, but its location between Israel and Lebanon means that it could lead to a new conflict between the two neighbours.\n\nWhile Lebanon’s President Michel Aoun said on Monday that United States-brokered negotiations over the exploration of Karish had reached the “final stages”, Israel is expected to begin preliminary work on Tuesday to start extracting gas, a move that Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah called a “red line” on Saturday.\n\nFor its part, Israel’s Defence Minister Benny Gantz has said if Hezbollah harmed an offshore rig in Karish, “the price will be Lebanon”.\n\nThe two countries have a history of conflict, most notably when Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 during the latter’s civil war, as well as the 2006 Lebanon War.\n\nMany fear that the dispute over where exactly the maritime border crosses Karish could unintentionally ignite a new fight.\n\nHowever, it appears as though the current tension may be more about appearances than actual preparations for war.\n\n“It’s pure politics, to be able to say that any deal that comes in, Hezbollah had a role in it, and they defended the rights of Lebanon,” said Laury Haytayan, MENA director of Natural Resources Governance Institute.\n\n“They want to bring back the idea that their power and weapons are used in the national interest and not in the Iranian agenda, reshaping the narrative that they protect Lebanon’s wealth,” Haytayan told Al Jazeera.\n\nAccording to Haytayan, the two countries also view the maritime border dispute differently; while Lebanon sees it as an energy and economic issue, Israel sees it as a security issue.\n\n“For Israel, it’s very important to deal with this to take away one element of tension and possible escalation with Hezbollah,” Haytayan said. “If Lebanon starts exploration and has its own oil and gas, Hezbollah won’t be able to threaten Israel’s platforms any more because it would be: you threaten my platform, I threaten your platform.”\n\nLine in the sea\n\nWhile both sides agree that the rich gasfields in the Eastern Mediterranean should be divided, the question is over where the line should be.\n\nIn 2020, Lebanon attempted to submit a new interpretation of the border that would have given it the northern part of Karish, which is estimated to have $1.3bn worth of gas.\n\nThat was rejected by Israel and the US, and negotiations stalled for nearly two years.\n\nThis year, Lebanon dropped the 2020 border proposal, and the two countries are expected to compromise on a border position similar to the Hof line – originally proposed in 2012 by then-mediator Frederic Hof – which gives all of Karish to Israel and most of the South Saida Prospect, or Qana field, to Lebanon.\n\nHowever, negotiations have hit a sensitive point pertaining to where, on land, the maritime border starts, which could have implications on territorial delineation and sovereignty.\n\nA senior government official close to the negotiations told Al Jazeera that Beirut has asked Israel to “clarify” what the latter has labelled “security issues” regarding the land border.\n\n“If it’s a security issue there won’t be a problem and we will reach an agreement because there will be an arrangement, [but] we cannot agree on any modification on the land or any consequence that would lead to any modification of the land [border],” the source said.\n\nAfter his last visit to Beirut on September 9, US mediator Amos Hochstein said progress was made, but that “more work needs to be done” in the coming weeks to reach an agreement.\n\nHowever, as the negotiations drag on, there is more potential for their collapse.\n\nHezbollah has threatened to attack a ship sent to Karish by Israel, and on July 2 Israel said it shot down three drones headed towards the gasfield launched by Hezbollah.\n\nMeanwhile, Energean, the company licensed by Israel to extract gas from Karish, has announced it will start imminently, with Israel under added pressure to increase its energy output after it signed a deal with the European Union to export gas for the first time, as the bloc seeks alternatives to Russian energy.\n\n“Until now the negotiations are going in the right way, it’s normal to go back and forward in negotiations,” the Lebanese official added.\n\n“There is progress, but I don’t know if the progress means we will reach an agreement.”\n\nSolution for Lebanon’s economic crisis?\n\nAt home, the Lebanese government has sold the promise of the Qana field as the light at the end of a financially-collapsing tunnel, despite experts warning that no deal can be a substitute for the urgent reforms needed to stabilise Lebanon’s economy.\n\nInternal oil production would ease the country’s deep energy crisis, which has seen residents coping with little, if any, state-run electricity. Politicians have also sold it as a leveraging tool to negotiate an International Monetary Fund loan from a stronger position.\n\nHowever, if negotiations with Israel fail, Lebanon will be left to convince the French energy company Total, which owns the contractual rights to exploit the area, to operate in a disputed area, something the company has said is not willing to do.\n\nIn addition, if oil and gas are found in Qana, it may still fall within Israel’s Exclusive Economic Zone, meaning that further negotiations would be needed.\n\nFunding would also be needed to restore decrepit power infrastructure, and the use of the Arab Gas Pipeline to export to other Arab countries.\n\nAnd, according to Diana Kaissy, an advisory board member at the Lebanese Oil and Gas Initiative, the existence of oil and gas in Qana is still uncertain.\n\n“We cannot say a field exists unless you drill and you find that reservoir,” Kaissy told Al Jazeera. “So far no drilling has happened and no reservoir was found, and so the existence of Qana is just a name given to an idea to what we might find when we drill.”",

    "Sectarian Political Settlements in Lebanon": "Throughout its history, Lebanon has survived on political and social settlements and compromises. A familiar pattern has emerged: tussles, negotiations, and sporadic quarrels erupt and last for a while, followed by a compromise which produces relative stability for a short period of time until the premise upon which the settlement was achieved collapses, and chaos ensues once again. The factors influencing these settlements are usually internal ones; nevertheless, external powers and regional conflicts have also played a significant role in shaping the Lebanese state and ensuring its survival.\n\nAs Lebanon faces the worst economic crisis in its modern history, a central question that has always preoccupied the Lebanese people is coming to the forefront of the national debate: Is Lebanon at a crossroads that will lead to a radical change in the system of governance? Will the country ever be able to rid itself of the disintegrating and corrupt regime that has led the country astray for far too long? Answering these questions requires an examination of the establishment of the Lebanese state, as well as the internal and external factors that laid its foundations. Such an examination also provides clarity about the nature of the settlements the regime tends to make and the factors that might produce them.\n\nFirst, the Lebanese regime is an edifice built on a delicate sectarian balance that, if shaken, can cause conflict and dangerous polarization that may easily lead to bloodshed. A case in point is the speech delivered by Michel Aoun, Lebanese president and former military general, upon his return to the country following the withdrawal of Syrian troops in 2005. In this speech, Aoun attacked the corruption of the then-ruling government and announced that any reform should begin by restoring the representation of Christians in all decision-making processes and in all state institutions. His announcement immediately led to a conflict within the ruling regime, resulting in government paralysis and producing the infamous presidential vacuum that lasted from 2014 to 2016.\n\nBased on popular opinion, the entry into power of the Free Patriotic Movement (FPM), a Lebanese Christian political party founded by Michel Aoun, led to a change in the balance of the sectarian quota system that the state follows religiously. When Aoun demanded the restoration of the Christian share in the Lebanese state—a share that was overtaken by the political forces of the Future Movement, the Amal Movement, and the Progressive Socialist Party—it led to the outbreak of a fierce political conflict between these forces that persists today.\n\nSecond, there are several factors that determine the balance of power between the conflicting sects. These include the demographic size of a sect, its financial and military capabilities, its external alliances, and the ability of a sect’s political leadership to mobilize a united front. These dynamics affect the balance of power when a compromise or a settlement is being negotiated, and they also determine the distribution of political quotas among the sects. For example, the unity of a sect behind a single political leadership gives it the power to veto any political or economic decision. However, if the sect is divided into several poles, the approval of one of its poles for a government decision is enough to confer sectarian and national support. Similarly, if a party enjoys external financial support that enables it to improve the social and economic conditions of its community, its popularity increases as the community unites behind it. This strengthens the party’s negotiating position and allows it to impose its conditions when political settlements occur.\n\nThird, experience has shown that changes in the balance of power lead to compromises in quota distribution, as illustrated by the Taif Agreement, the Syrian presence, and the Doha Agreement. The Lebanese would not have reached the Taif Agreement had there not been a shift in the balance of power at a regional level. The collapse of the Soviet Union and Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait prompted influential countries like Saudi Arabia, Syria, and the United States to accelerate a settlement to end the Lebanese Civil War and to focus their efforts on the war in the Gulf.\n\nThe Syrian military and political presence in Lebanon—a direct result of an agreement between Syria and the United States which saw Syria support Washington's war on Iraq, with Washington handing over the Lebanese file to Syria in return—continued until 2005 and played a pivotal role in establishing the settlement produced by the Taif Accord. When the US declared its second war on Iraq, however, a rift in the relations of the two allies culminated in the expulsion of the Syrian forces from Lebanon after the assassination of Rafik Hariri in February 2005.\n\nFurthermore, when in May 2008, Hezbollah Armed members raided Beirut and large swathes of Mount Lebanon in an attempt to dominate the decision-making of the Lebanese state, a new shift in the balance of power occurred, putting pressure on the regional parties to reach a settlement that deterred what they perceived to be “Hezbollah’s domination of the state,” especially after they failed to dismantle the resistance communications network. To avert the imminent danger of civil war and to end the crisis as soon as possible, the disputing parties were brought to the negotiation table in Qatar, and the Doha Agreement for Lebanon was reached. Thus, once more, it is clear that the desperation of a situation forces the involved parties to find an appropriate solution that allows the country to enjoy relative—albeit fragile—political stability that could last a decade or more.\n\nA review of Lebanon's political and sectarian conflicts demonstrates that no matter the severity of the crisis, tensions between various religious sects remain the greatest obstacle hampering reform efforts. For example, the sectarian conflicts that erupted between the Druze and Christians in the nineteenth century led to the establishment of a sectarian custom by which political positions, public offices, and public funding were distributed among sects according to a specific quota system. Later, when the Lebanese civil war ended, no reform process was adopted to address the sectarian causes of the war. Ironically, Lebanon’s political system institutionalized sectarianism and enshrined it in constitutional texts, allowing the ruling regimes to persevere and become more powerful through sectarian conflicts. This strange phenomenon is even more evident when Lebanon is hit by a crisis, such as the current financial one, that forces the Lebanese people to turn to their sectarian leaders for protection, including social and economic services.\n\nThe effect of this long history of sectarian complexity was reflected in the failure of the cross- sectarian demonstrations of October 2019 to exploit a historic moment in which a wide swath of Lebanese were united in their demand for reform and political change. The leaders of these demonstrations were not attentive to the fact that the sectarian issue was lurking in the darkness, waiting to ignite like embers under ashes, and that the process of extinguishing it would require great effort, organization, and a clear vision. A few days into the demonstrations, the sectarian discourse returned, and the demonstrators began to retreat into their sectarian cocoons once more. In addition, bickering political parties and civil society associations tried to exploit these demonstrations to achieve political victory over their opponents, leading to their discreditation in the public eye.\n\nAs demonstrated by the results of the first parliamentary elections since 2019, there is no doubt that the economic and financial crisis that has assailed Lebanon in recent years will have a significant impact on the Lebanese political scene. The election results have yielded major political change as traditional political parties either lost their sizable representation or were forced out of parliament entirely. However, despite the severe economic crisis and continuing political turmoil, average Lebanese voters have remained loyal to the traditional sectarian forces—the same forces they have accused of enshrining corruption and of causing the crisis!\n\nThis paradoxical behavior is the direct result of the weakness of the Lebanese state and its inability to provide even the most basic services to its citizens who were left to survive a collapsing economy, decaying infrastructure, and a financial crisis on their own. In the absence of a strong centralized government, sectarian forces rushed to fill the vacuum left by the state by providing social, financial, and health services, while also restoring and dominating the sectarian discourse they revived after the demonstrations.\n\nMichel Foucault argues that the success of political forces in subjugating the masses is rooted not in their ability to use military force or the force of law, but in what is termed “power/knowledge,” or the use of knowledge to convince people of their orientations and policies. Through this, the masses are dominated by an emotional mobilization discourse that mimics the collective consciousness of the sect and perpetuates a culture of fear of “the other” that enables politicians to pose as the saviors and protectors of the sect. Lebanese politicians usually benefit from the collective memory of their community by constantly invoking the heroism they claim to have exhibited in defending their sect during the civil war.\n\nIn conclusion, the intensification of the financial and economic crises does not mean that the sectarian Lebanese regime is dissolving or that it is on the verge of falling. Despite the demonstrations of October 2019, and the failure of the political class to develop a recovery plan in the three years since, the sectarian system remains steadfast, feeding on crises that, in turn, further entrench sectarianism. In fact, the system derives its strength and continuity from these very crises.\n\nAbbas Assi holds a PhD in International Relations from the University of Leeds in Britain, an MA in International Studies, and an MA in Political Economy from the University of Sydney in Australia.

    "‘No evidence’ of navy ramming in April Lebanon boat disaster": "An investigation conducted by an Australian NGO says the boat is largely intact, but families dispute the findings.\n\nA report examining the deadly sinking of a boat carrying migrants and refugees off Lebanon in April has found that the wreck of the boat was intact, appearing to contradict claims from victims’ family members that the boat was deliberately rammed by the Lebanese navy, and placing an Australian NGO at the centre of a continuing controversy over who was to blame.\n\nApproximately 40 people are believed to have died in the incident on April 23, which occurred off the coast of Tripoli, in Lebanon’s north, where the country’s economic crisis has hit particularly hard.\n\nThe Australian NGO AusRelief, which contracted a Pisces VI submarine to attempt to retrieve the wreck and the bodies, has come under heavy criticism, with families saying that the team left Lebanon without completing their mission, and also accusing the Lebanese Armed Forces of obstructing justice for not sharing high-resolution images of the wreck with them.\n\nHowever, photos taken by the submarine, which were included in a report finalised a week after the mission ended its work on September 2, and which Al Jazeera has seen, appear to show an intact vessel, supporting the report’s findings.\n\nThe report states there was no damage to the bow, stern, port side or starboard side, but that there was some damage to the anchor bow roller so that the anchor chain splice had become dislodged.\n\n“It’s black and white to us,” the mission director of AusRelief, which has a number of Australian-Lebanese members, Tom Zreika told Al Jazeera.\n\n“The damage to the anchor line shows in my opinion, that boat was involved in a collision, but it wasn’t a bigger boat causing the damage,” he said.\n\n“My observations are that boat rammed the navy vessel [because] the [damage] is consistent … with the height of the marks on the [navy’s] SS Beirut where there are two white marks on the latter third of the boat.”\n\nThat would be consistent with the Lebanese navy’s version of events: that the boat crashed into one of three navy vessels that had gone out to attempt to turn it back.\n\nThe report also states that the bodies found – which include a woman who appears to have been attempting to break out of a window with her baby – were in danger of disintegration if the mission attempted to move them.\n\nIn response to the report, a lawyer representing some of the victims’ families, Mohamad Fadi Sablouh, told Al Jazeera that it did not contain anything new, and had the same “bad quality photos” that had been taken by the submarine and that they had been shown before.\n\n“They said they would give the families a video and we did not see any video and the photos are not in focus except the women and the baby,” Sablouh said, insisting that the submarine could take 4k resolution images, which should have been provided.\n\n“They said there was damage on the front [of the boat] but the photos didn’t focus on the front.”\n\nA source at the Lebanese Armed Forces, who did not wish to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media, said that the navy had not tampered with the photographs and videos taken by the AusRelief mission.\n\n“It’s not us, we didn’t take anything from AusRelief, we didn’t keep any copies for the navy of anything, any document, any picture, we just took two or three pictures from the screen of the laptop when the Pisces VI team was showing us just to say we found the boat, that’s why we took those picture, and those pictures were on the army website.”\n\nCover-up allegations\n\nSablouh had previously told Al Jazeera that the victims’ families had become even more certain the boat was hit by the Lebanese navy, causing it to sink, due to how the armed forces had handled the photos emerging from the submarine dives.\n\nThe lawyer, who has become an unofficial spokesman for the victims’ families, claims that families were restricted from attending a press conference at the end of August in Tripoli.\n\n“I felt something was being concealed and they want to close up everything … I wanted to see the photos, so they took me into the control room to view them, but most of them were not in high resolution,” Sablouh said.\n\nThe source at the Lebanese Armed Forces said that the families had not been invited in order to not “make it a [media] circus”.\n\nSablouh says he tried to push a local Tripoli politician, General Ashraf Rifi, to obtain higher-quality images and videos from the armed forces, but was told that they were still being edited together.\n\n“It’s now been 10 days and still we didn’t get the videos,” Sablouh said. “Why would the military montage the videos instead of us receiving the raw videos from the submarine?\n\n“Why are the people in question, which is the military, supervising everything that is happening in this investigation?”\n\nThe Lebanese Armed Forces has not yet replied to an official request for comment.\n\n‘Stuck in the middle’\n\n“We’re advocates for refugees, we never envisaged that we would be put in the middle of two opposing parties, and to make a determination, that wasn’t our role,” Zreika said, lamenting where the AusRelief team finds itself, and stressing that it had not taken sides.\n\n“Our role was to purely come in and locate the bodies and if we couldn’t recover them, give them a service, it wasn’t for the sake of making a legal determination on who was at fault.\n\n“The bottom line for us was to do this purely humanitarian task of giving honour and respect to the refugees,” Zreika added. “Refugees are not garbage, they’re not the refuse of a country, the Lebanese people are suffering and this is the net effect of it.”\n\nDue to the continuing investigation to determine why the boat sank, the AusRelief and Pisces VI team were required to hand over all images of the wreck and bodies – 10 of which were visible including women, children and infants – to the Lebanese Armed Forces and the attorney general immediately after arriving back to shore.\n\nAusRelief also says that its contract with the submarine owner and operator was only for seven days – which had been completed.\n\nAusRelief explained that, due to the way the boat was sitting flat on the sea bed “acting like a suction cup”, the only way to float it to the surface with airbags would be by using an unmanned robotic vehicle to dig a trench around the boat, empty the silt under the hull, and then thread the balloons through it, requiring a professional deep sea salvage team using floating sheerleg cranes, and costing an estimated $9m.\n\nThe mission has already cost $650,000.\n\nLawyer Sablouh said he had been informed the boat was stuck in the seabed “like cement”, and that a body had disintegrated when the mission attempted to retrieve it. Still, he emphasised that clear videos, proving what had been described, had not been shown.\n\n“Why isn’t there just a video of that attempt so they can clear everything, so everything becomes clear, so there’s progress in this investigation,” he asked.\n\nAusRelief said that the information gathered from survivors and authorities, prior to sending out the submarine, suggested that the boat would be broken into two pieces due to a collision, or floating stern up or bow up, meaning that the equipment and team they had contracted would have been able to lift the boat.\n\nThreats\n\nThe Australian-Lebanese team had planned to spend a further week in the country, though as the tension between the armed forces and the families increased, Zreika says he was told by navy officials that their safety could not be guaranteed. The armed forces source told Al Jazeera that the group had been threatened by three brothers from Tripoli who owned the boat, and who also had family members on board who died.\n\n“These are real and perceivable threats, what we went through are not made up and if the army is impotent to protect us, then we had to make our own decisions to protect ourselves,” Zreika explained, while stating that other AusRelief staff remained in Lebanon and were continuing the organisation’s work.\n\nSablouh said he has not heard of any threats being made to the team but confirmed that the sunken boat was owned by the three brothers – who he does not represent.\n\nThe source in the Lebanese Armed Forces claimed that the family was involved in smuggling, and may have been forcing the other families to blame the navy for ramming the boat in order to get compensation for those killed, as well as to avoid manslaughter charges themselves.\n\nSablouh denied that the family wanted compensation, saying that the military general had already offered money to the family who owned the boat, but that it had been rejected.\n\nThe lawyer said that the family in question were “just like anyone in Lebanon wanting to flee” and questioned why the navy did not intercept the boat before it left the shore, considering that intelligence services had images of when the boat was boarded and set sail.\n\n“Why did they let it reach where it did before stopping it, and why is this the only boat stopped from the many that try to do the same thing?” Sablouh said.\n\nHe further added that if the family – whose names Al Jazeera has withheld for security reasons – had issued threats, the Lebanese security forces should have organised a conference at the end of the mission to explain the findings to the families.\n\nAs for the families, Sablouh said, they believe this is just another example of the lack of justice in Lebanon for victims.\n\n“Just like the Beirut Port explosion, they’re letting the people who did what they did get away with it and bring no justice to the victims and the families,” Sablouh said. “The case should have been investigated without the military, who are seen as the perpetrator.”",

    "In Lebanon, drinking water has become a luxury that few can afford": "An unlicensed water distributor working for a private company operates in the neighbourhood of Sin el Fil in Beirut. Lebanon the third most threatened nation in the world by drinking water scarcity, according to the World Resources Institute.\n\nTeressa Walid is a mother of three who works as a nurse in the epidemiology department of Rafik Hariri University Hospital, Lebanon’s largest public hospital, located on the outskirts of Beirut. Like most Lebanese, she is struggling to survive in the midst of the worst financial crisis in the country’s history, which has seen a substantial deterioration in living conditions. Electricity, clean water, medicine and fuel are in short supply, the Lebanese currency has lost 90 per cent of its value and inflation has soared to triple digits. As a result, more than 80 per cent of the country’s population now find themselves living below the poverty line.\n\n“We shouldn’t have to pay to drink water, but our government has forced us into this situation. Bottled water is considered an essential commodity in Lebanon. There’s no alternative for drinking water,” says Walid, as she waits in line at a water treatment and distribution facility to fill her containers with the life-sustaining liquid.\n\nWalid has an afternoon shift at the hospital and her husband “works all day” to pay for the expenses, so she takes her car to collect the water containers. She could also have the company deliver them to her home but the bill would be 25 per cent more to cover the cost of petrol, so she prefers to pick them up herself and save money that will help her cover other basic needs.\n\nWalid’s family lives in the Choueifat neighbourhood in the southern suburbs of Beirut, where there has been no running water for weeks. Water cuts are common in the summer, she explains, but they have never been “this long and continuous”. According to a UNICEF report, amid frequent power outages, per capita water supplies have decreased dramatically since the beginning of the crisis, falling short of the 35 litres a day considered to be the minimum acceptable quantity.\n\nAs a nurse, Walid is particularly concerned by the lack of health controls for tap water: “It’s no good for taking a shower or washing food. It comes out dirty, smells bad and is causing our children to contract diseases. We don’t have any of our basic rights. The state should at least provide us with clean drinking water so we can live,” she says.\n\nHalf a salary, just for water\n\nWith this basic public service lacking, many Lebanese households have been forced to rely on private companies and water tankers for access to running water. The same is true for electricity: due to power cuts in the public grid, inhabitants have to rely on expensive private generators to provide at least 12 hours of electricity per day to their homes.\n\nIn addition to the financial instability shaking the country, Lebanon’s public institutions lack the liquidity to import fuel - on which almost all of the country’s electricity production depends, and which they purchase in dollars. This has led state-owned utility provider Électricité Du Liban, which controls 90 per cent of the country’s electricity production, transmission and distribution, to cut electricity supply to three hours a day.\n\nThis in turn affects drinking water supply networks, as electricity is needed for pumping water and operating water treatment plants. While the lack of fuel is one of the main factors accelerating the drinking water crisis, Hicham Richani, former president of the water companies’ union, explains that the root of the problem lies in “government mafias that wanted to monopolise water”.\n\nLebanon is a country with abundant water resources. It has snow-capped mountains that feed 16 perennial rivers – which flow uninterrupted all year round – with a combined annual river flow of between 2,151 and 3,900 million cubic metres.\n\nBut despite these natural resources, years of dysfunctional administrations and poor policies on the use and maintenance of water reserves had by 2019 made Lebanon the third most threatened nation in the world by drinking water scarcity, according to the World Resources Institute (WRI), a Washington-based NGO.\n\n“The Lebanese government chose to privatise the water by licensing several dozen bottling companies, the majority of which are operated by multinationals Nestlé and Pepsi, rather than invest in water infrastructure,” says Richani. Since Lebanese have no other choice but to buy drinking water, the current crisis has seen the emergence of a parallel market, with hundreds of local companies operating illegally and offering much cheaper but poorer quality water.\n\nA 2016 study by Blominvest Bank shows that the bottled water business in Lebanon has been a growing market for years. The licensed bottling companies alone account for an annual production of between 700 and 800 million litres of water. If illegal companies were counted, the figure would be much higher. The annual profit from this business is around US$300 million, and continues to grow with each year.\n\n“Since 2012, we’ve been fighting for more licences to be issued and for more competition in the market, but licensing has remained a personal dispute between the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Industry, which has yet to be resolved,” explains Richani. The veteran trade unionist sums up the drinking water crisis in two words: “Simply inaccessible”.\n\nSpiralling inflation in the country has caused the price of bottled water to rise dramatically, with Lebanese consumers paying three to five times more than they did a year ago. According to UNICEF’s calculations, a family of five drinking about two litres of bottled water per person per day would need to spend 6.5 million Lebanese pounds (US$4,300) a year on water.\n\nIn other words, given that the average Lebanese salary now ranges from 900,000 to one million Lebanese pounds (between US$600 and US$660), a family in this situation would need to spend just over half their salary on drinking water.\n\nAs a result, many families who can no longer afford to pay nearly US$5 for a 12-litre container of water from licensed companies are now buying their bottled water from unlicensed sellers for US$1 or US$2, even when it means putting the health of their loved ones at risk.\n\nAccording to its most recent report on the water crisis in Lebanon: “One year ago, UNICEF warned that the water system was at breaking point. While a total collapse of public water supply networks has so far been averted, the crisis has not been resolved and millions of people are affected by the limited availability of clean and safe water.”\n\nMigration, the climate crisis and untreated wastewater\n\nIn addition to the collateral damage caused by the energy crisis and mismanagement of water supplies, other factors have contributed to water stress. Lebanon, it should be recalled, has been host to nearly 1.5 million Syrian refugees for more than a decade. As the refugee population has increased, so have water demand and consumption. However, while their arrival in the country coincided with a 20 per cent increase in domestic water consumption, the refugee population has only increased national water stress (an indicator that measures the need when demand for this essential commodity exceeds the available quantity) by 6 per cent.\n\nOther factors such as climate change and drought have also contributed to water scarcity. According to a study by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), renewable water resources available in Lebanon have fallen below the water stress threshold of 1,000 cubic metres per capita per year. In fact, according to data from 2017, water availability then was already at around 704 cubic metres per capita per year, leaving Lebanon facing significant challenges in securing potable supplies.\n\nIn addition, due to the lack of wastewater monitoring, tons of rubbish and industrial waste are dumped into the sea and the country’s rivers in certain areas, polluting the available resources. One of the most dramatic examples is the Litani River in the Beqaa region, Lebanon longest river and an essential source of its socio-economic development since the construction of the Qaraoun dam in 1959.\n\nToday, however, “the levels of contamination are so high that the dammed water is not suitable for cultivation,” says Yousef Antoun, director of the Litani River Authority, a public institution that acts autonomously to implement irrigation, drinking water supply and electricity generation projects. Each year, the upper Litani basin receives about 45.5 million cubic metres of domestic wastewater and another 3.7 million cubic metres of industrial wastewater, which is discharged into the river without any treatment.\n\nAntoun warns that “better planning for the responsible use of water resources is urgently needed, as high levels of water pollution have put biodiversity, agricultural production and the health of the Lebanese population at risk”.\n\nDespite an ambitious US$800 million plan announced by the government in 2016 to clean up the Litani River and Lake Qaraoun, financed in part by loans from the World Bank and other donors such as USAID and the UN, there has been “very little progress in implementing these projects,” Antoun says.\n\n“If factory inspections aren’t being carried out there is little we can do,” complains Azhara Yousef, a laboratory technician at a treatment plant on the banks of the Litani. “The water from the river is very polluted. We lower the toxicity level here by 1,000 points, but if we don’t stop the waste discharges, it simply gets polluted again,” she says.\n\nWhile short-term solutions to the crisis remain elusive, its socio-economic consequences are catastrophic. For many of the families across the country who live below the poverty line, receiving their water ration has become a daily battle.",

    "Conn. restaurant Villa of Lebanon makes Big E debut with ‘fresh’ alternative": "Villa of Lebanon, a family-owned and operated Lebanese and Greek food restaurant based in South Windsor, Conn., has been making its Big E debut and has already been attracting many customers, old and new, to its food stall.\n\nRun by Ali Alhusseini, the business has set up operations in the Young Building at The Big E, adjacent to the many vendors selling ranges of items from home goods, to clothing, jewelry, art, knick-knacks and plenty more.\n\n“It’s a very high volume traffic area,” Alhusseini said of his business’ fairgrounds spot, providing shoppers with ready accessibility and also tantalizing tastes and smells as they look for their next best purchase.\n\nAlhusseini said many customers familiar with the business, who often frequent it in Connecticut, have stopped by “every day” to chat, buy some food or wish Alhusseini and his staff well.\n\n“[Customers] like the idea to have someone they are used to,” Alhusseini said.\n\nAs a testament to this, during a conversation with MassLive one such fan of the restaurant happened to pass by mid-interview to compliment the business and greet Alhusseini.\n\nBut it’s not just those who already know Villa of Lebanon that are being drawn in by its menu variety on display or the aromas of freshly prepared meats wafting in the air.\n\n“It’s very hard to pass by and you don’t want to eat,” Alhusseini said.\n\nAmong the wide assortment of menu items there are vegetable-based dishes such as chickpea salad, hummus, baba ghanoush, falafel and grape leaves as well as meat options such as seasoned shish-kebabs, spicy shawarma, kebeh and gyro meat fresh off of the rotisserie.\n\n“It’s very fresh as you see, healthy food,” Alhusseini said, providing an alternative to deep-fried options located elsewhere on the fairgrounds.\n\nThe menu at Villa of Lebanon also rotates daily, according to Alhusseini, who at the end of last week had put out trays of sweet-tasting baklava, coated in pistachio and walnuts — catching the eyes of several passersby who specifically requested it.\n\nIn addition to food, the stall also features a smoothie bar offering cool, blended refreshments made with fresh fruits such as strawberries and mangoes.\n\nAmong the most popular menu options has been Villa of Lebanon’s lunch special consisting of three items — one meat dish and two side orders — of a customer’s choosing for $15, Alhusseini said.\n\nAlhusseini said that business and sales have been “very successful” throughout its first week at The Big E and he said he’s thankful to the fair’s organizers for providing Villa of Lebanon a location to set up shop.\n\n“It’s a good opportunity for people to expose their restaurants,” Alhusseini said of Villa of Lebanon’s debut, adding that he enjoys the challenge of expanding the business’ reach and visibility among new clientele.\n\n“Even though [the restaurant industry] is a tough business, it’s how you make it, how you look at it, how you work at it, how much dedication you give give it and love for the food — that’s what is great,” Alhusseini said.\n\nThe restaurant opened at its current location at 575 John Fitch Blvd. in South Windsor, Connecticut, in 2008, but Alhusseini said he has been a chef for 42 years and first opened Villa of Lebanon in 1979.\n\nAlhusseini, who is originally from Lebanon, said he was actually born in a restaurant owned by his parents — and after getting his education in the U.S., he eventually decided to go back to his roots and go into the restaurant business himself locally.\n\nThe restaurant will remain at The Big E until the fair’s closing day on Sunday, Oct. 2.",
    "Lebanon: Transfer investigation into death in custody of Syrian refugee to the civilian justice system": "The heart-wrenching death in custody this week of Bashar Abdel-Saud, a Syrian refugee who was tortured, must serve as a wake-up call to the Lebanese authorities to address torture in their detention facilities, said Amnesty International today.\n\nLebanese judicial officials have announced an investigation by the military prosecution, however Amnesty International is calling for the investigation and trial to take place before the civilian justice system.\n\n“Bashar Abdel-Saud cruelly died while in the custody of Lebanon’s State Security agency – the images of his bruised, gashed body offer a distressing reminder of the need to urgently implement the 2017 anti-torture law. It is unacceptable for torture to be continuing to occur in Lebanese detention centres and with such brutality – the authorities must put a stop to it immediately,” said Heba Morayef, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa.\n\n“While it is a positive measure that a group of security personnel have been remanded in custody for questioning, under human rights law standards, military courts should restrict their jurisdiction to that of military offences by military personnel. To ensure transparency and impartiality, Abdel-Saud’s case must urgently be referred to a civilian court. His family deserves justice and reparations for their tragic loss.”\n\nSecurity officers arrested Abdel-Saud from his home in Beirut on 30 August, without presenting an arrest warrant. According to Mohammed Sablouh, the lawyer assigned to Abdel-Saud’s case, the family received a call from a State Security official four days later on 3 September, asking them to collect his dead body from their headquarters in Tebneen, Southern Lebanon. Sablouh and the family refuse to collect the body before they receive an independent and comprehensive forensic report from the doctor who has examined the body.\n\n…the images of his [Bashar Abdel-Saud] bruised, gashed body offer a distressing reminder of the need to urgently implement the 2017 anti-torture law. Heba Morayef, Amnesty International\n\nFollowing the uproar caused by leaked pictures and videos revealing bruises and gashes covering Abdel-Saud’s body article, State Security issued a statement saying that he had been arrested for possession of a fake 50$ bill and that he had “confessed” to being a member of ISIS before he died. They also said that the case would be investigated internally.\n\nOn 2 September, the government commissioner of the Military Court examined the body and ordered the detention of five officers in the State Security branch in Tibneen, including the Lieutenant in charge and the officers suspected of committing torture.\n\nMohammed Sablouh told Amnesty International that the authorities had thus far accused Abdel-Saud of three things: “they said he had fake currency, they said he used and dealt with Captagon, and they said he was a member of ISIS. All these are lies. We need a transparent investigation in the civilian court to know what has happened and who is to be held accountable.”\n\nBashar Abdel-Saud was 30 years old when he died and had three children, including a one-month old child. He had defected from the Syrian army eight years ago and moved to Lebanon to work as a porter. He lived with his family in the Sabra and Shatila camp for Palestinian refugees in Beirut.\n\nHis experience of torture was not an isolated one. In March 2021, Amnesty International released a report documenting an array of violations against 26 Syrian refugees, including four children, held on terrorism-related charges between 2014 and early 2021. Among the violations were unfair trial and torture, which included beatings with metal sticks, electric cables and plastic pipes. Authorities failed to investigate the torture claims, even when detainees or their lawyers told a judge in court that they had been tortured.\n\nAbdel-Saud’s case echoes that of Ziad Itani, a Lebanese actor who was arrested by the State Security agency in December 2017 on trumped-up charges of spying for Israel before being tried before a military court. Itani said State Security officers subjected him to severe torture, including beating him with electric cables, tying him up in metal chains, kicking and punching him in the face, and threatening to rape him. He filed a complaint against them in November 2018 but no further steps have been taken to effectively investigate his torture.\n\n“During Lebanon’s last review by the UN Human Rights Council in 2021, the Lebanese government committed to implement the anti-torture law, investigate all allegations of torture and other ill-treatment, hold the perpetrators accountable, and nullify confessions under torture. Yet impunity for torture remains commonplace, with dozens of complaints regarding torture and other ill-treatment filed under the 2017 Anti-Torture Law rarely reaching court and most closed without an effective investigation. It is time for this to stop.” Said Heba Morayef.\n\nBackground\n\nLebanon ratified the Convention Against Torture (CAT) and its Optional Protocol in 2000 and 2008 respectively. In compliance with its obligations under the CAT, Lebanon passed an anti-torture law in 2017, which makes torture a criminal offence.\n\nUnder international human rights law, military personnel should be tried before military courts only for breaches of military discipline. Under the Lebanese anti-torture law, the power to prosecute, investigate and try is granted exclusively to ordinary civilian courts. Also, the prohibition of torture applies regardless of the nature of the alleged crime.\n\n**Correction** Security officers arrested Abdel-Saud from his home in Beirut on 30 August, not 31 August.",

Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight “I am worried something might happen to me in the street,” the 66-year-old said, adding that she suffers from cancer, heart disease and diabetes. “I would usually call my children or anyone. Now, I cannot recharge my phone account.”\n\nIt’s just one more symptom of Lebanon’s unfolding economic crisis that the United Nations said last year had plunged 82 percent of the country into poverty. Amid some of the worst inflation in the world, the value of the Lebanese pound has plummeted by 90 percent.\n\nWhen the Ministry of Telecommunications decided on July 1 to bring fees in line with the rising cost of operations, the price of mobile phone service quintupled while internet broadband fees more than doubled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe caretaker minister of telecommunications, Johnny Corm, defended the spike, saying it is necessary to keep the sector afloat amid the country’s economic collapse. But it also meant that the rest of the population, whose real wages have nosedived with the currency, can’t afford their phones, which are used for a variety of essential tasks, including accessing the internet, checking when electricity is available and ordering from the pharmacy or grocery store.\n\nOf course, phone use also depends on whether there is even service. Last week, employees at the country’s two mobile phone companies, Touch and Alfa, went on strike over wages. On Wednesday, they were joined by employees of the main telecommunications provider, Ogero. The result has been disruptions in internet and cellular communications across the country, even completely shutting it down in some places.\n\nLocal media outlets reported Thursday that Corm had threatened to send the army into the service centers where employees are holding sit-ins if work didn’t restart.\n\nIn late 2019, Lebanon’s economy was crippled. As the currency crumbled, inflation on food reached 332 percent, the highest in the world over the summer, according to an August report from the World Bank.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe high prices for phone use also mean many lower-income families can’t reach the aid agencies and nongovernmental organizations that could help them. Mercy Corps, an international humanitarian aid organization, said it received 70 percent fewer calls and requests on its hotline in July than in previous months.\n\nElie Yaacoub, an analyst on a Mercy Corps team that compiled a report on the crisis, said other humanitarian organizations have reported a similar drop in calls. He added they are all trying to set up a free hotline, but that decision requires a judicial order — and judges in Lebanon are on strike.\n\nEmbrace, a local nonprofit organization that operates Lebanon’s main suicide prevention hotline, has had an increased number of callers asking operators to call them back because receiving calls is free, said Mia Atwi, the group’s president and co-founder.\n\nThose relying on mobile data for their jobs are also drastically affected. Omar al-Aridi, a driver for a ride-hailing application, said the cost of the data package he needs for work ballooned sixfold under the new rates.\n\n“We are paying a lot, and the product is very small,” he said. His employer does not cover data expenses, leaving him to pay them on his own.\n\nBefore the crisis, the telecommunications sector was a major source of revenue for the Lebanese state, and its history is plagued by accusations of corruption and lack of transparency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an April report, the country’s Court of Audit revealed that between 2010 and 2020, Lebanon’s telecom sector registered $6 billion in expenses for the telecom firms, Touch and Alfa, which the audit characterized as excessively high compared with similar markets.\n\n“Expenses for what? Who spent what? Who did they get permission from?” said Mohamad Najem, executive director of SMEX, an organization that works on advancing digital rights in Lebanon and the Arab region. SMEX is asking for a forensic audit to be conducted.\n\n“We want to know exactly not just how this money was spent, on what basis it was spent, why it was spent, who they got permission from, whether this was the best decision, who took this decision, etc.,” he said.\n\nAs internet service, described by the United Nations as a human right, is priced out of reach for many, there are fears for the future. The younger generation in particular is struggling to find affordable internet to do schoolwork and university projects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I’m just hoping I will be able to afford it,” said Karen Jamal, a 20-year-old graphic design student who is already working several jobs to pay for her studies.\n\n“Some programs that I use need internet to work; that is gonna be a bit difficult,” she added. “I’m starting to sit in some cafes and Starbucks and such just to use the WiFi.”\n\nGhosn, the cart seller, who has witnessed much of Lebanon’s turbulent modern history in her life, had hoped the new generation would not have to deal with such a crisis.\n\n“They made us live through wars, and now they killed our children with the economy.

    "Lebanon central bank stops fuel subsidies, prices set to rise": "The central bank decision means black market exchange rates have to be used, as the country’s economic crisis continues.\n\nLebanon’s central bank says it has stopped providing dollars for gasoline imports, a move that will likely lead to higher and more volatile prices as well as increased pressure on the local currency, which continues to lose value as the country’s economic crisis shows few signs of abating.\n\nThe central bank said last year that it would stop providing dollars at heavily subsidised exchange rates due to a dwindling supply of foreign currency reserves, but it continued to do so at a sub-market rate on its Sayrafa exchange platform.\n\nHowever, in recent weeks, the number of dollars provided via Sayrafa has been gradually reduced as part of a wider plan to end subsidies for most goods amid a financial collapse that has entered its fourth year.\n\nReuters reported that a central bank spokesperson said on Monday that importers would now have to source dollars from the black market, where the Lebanese pound is trading at approximately 35,000 pounds to the dollar. The Sayrafa rate last week was about 28,000 pounds.\n\n“If there is more volatility in the exchange rate there will be more volatility in the fuel price,” Maroun Chammas, a member of the Association of Petroleum Importing Companies, said.\n\nThe price for 20 litres of gasoline jumped by 20,000 pounds on Monday, a significant increase compared with regular daily fluctuations of a few thousand pounds in the weeks prior.\n\nBlack market prices\n\nGas Station Owners’ Syndicate spokesperson George Brax said gas station owners would now price fuel at the country’s “parallel market rate” – also known as the black market rate.\n\nChammas said importers had so far been able to source all the dollars they needed from the black market and that gasoline pumps would continue to accept payment in Lebanese pounds at the daily black market rate.\n\nLebanon’s crippling economic crisis has plunged three-quarters of its population into poverty and decimated the value of the Lebanese pound against the dollar by about 90 percent. The World Bank has described the collapse as one of the worst the world has seen in the last 150 years.\n\nFor years, Lebanese authorities have been working to replace subsidies on fuel, medicine, and wheat with a targeted cash-assistance programme, that would cost a fraction of the price of subsidies annually.\n\nHowever, despite securing a World Bank loan to fund it a year ago, the programme has not been properly implemented, leaving hundreds of thousands of families in need and without any safety net to soften the blow of price hikes.\n\nThe small Mediterranean country’s economic crisis over the past three years has been blamed on decades of corruption, wasteful spending, and nefarious financial planning at the hands of its ruling political parties and partners in the private sector.",

    "Bachir Gemayel: Lebanon’s past and future": "اضافة اعلان\n\nSymbols matter, because they shape people’s collective psyche. But symbols also distort history.\n\nBachir Gemayel was president of Lebanon for 21 days, until he was assassinated almost exactly 40 years ago.He was, however, Lebanon’s most important president because for large groups of the Lebanese he was a dream and the embodiment of the promise of the modern state of Lebanon that was established a century ago in 1920.But for other large groups of Lebanese he was a nightmare and the manifestation of an insoluble problem at the core of the modern state.The division of the groups is largely sectarian. The vast majority of those who see Gemayel as a dream are the Christian Maronites, the closest Eastern Christians to the Roman Catholic Church. The vast majority of the people who regard him as a nightmare are Muslims.Yet, the lines blur, and there are those of other religions, and without any religion, who cross to the other camp and see him as a president who could have moved Lebanon beyond the decay and blood of the past 40 years of the country’s history.Blood featured heavily in Gemayel’s story, and he was a leader of a militia that was accused of a number of the most horrendous massacres of the Lebanese Civil War.For his admirers, however, he was not merely a warrior. He was a savior.In the early 1970s, large groups of Palestinian fighters were expelled from Jordan, following the 1970 “Black September” battles between the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Jordanian armed forces, and came to Lebanon. The fighters joined tens of thousands of Palestinian refugees who had been in the country since the 1948 war.For many in Lebanon, especially the country’s Christians, the influx threatened Lebanon’s delicate demographic and social balance.The threat seemed particularly grave because the Palestinian leadership found an ally in Kamal Jumblatt, the preeminent Lebanese Druze leader of the time and one of Lebanon’s most sophisticated 20th-century minds. The meeting between the Palestinians and Jumblatt, and behind him an array of socialist forces was for most Lebanese Christians a tsunami that could wipe out their special position in Lebanon.The Maronites, the followers of Mar Maron, one of the most intriguing monks in the entire history of Eastern Christianity, felt compelled to act. They had for centuries been largely farmers in Mount Lebanon, most of them under the authority of Druze clans.The situation changed in the 17th and 18th centuries when demographic trends and successive revolts altered the power dynamics in Mount Lebanon in favor of the Maronites. But the greatest momentum behind Maronite power came from Ibrahim Pasha, the son of Mohamed Ali Pasha, the founder of modern Egypt, who took control of the entire Levant in the 1830s. Throughout that decade he made a Maronite leader, Bachir Al-Shihabi, his viceroy in Mount Lebanon.But Maronite power remained contested. Mount Lebanon witnessed acute violence in the second half of the 19th century, and by the end of World War I it had become clear that France, which had come to control the entire Levant, was keen to establish order by creating sectarian-based statelets in the region.It was the Maronite Church, however, along with a select group of Sunni Muslim families from Beirut, that lobbied France for the creation of a national state. Modern Lebanon came into existence in 1920.The new state’s key positions were distributed between the Maronites and Sunni and Shiite Muslims, with a special position reserved for the Druze. But from its beginning, modern Lebanon was a Maronite project, and it gave rise to Lebanon’s golden age during the 1950s and 1960s, especially after liberal, cosmopolitan Egypt was coming to an end after the fall of the Egyptian monarchy in 1952.Lebanon emerged as the center of free Arab media, the financial hub of the region, the birthplace of the most daring art and culture in the entire Arab Mashreq, and the destination in the region for entertainment of every sort.For the vast majority of Maronites, this Lebanon — a project that encompasses diversity but that is anchored in the Maronite view of Lebanon as the core of Eastern Christianity — was under threat because of the influx of tens of thousands of Palestinians. It was aggravated because Yasser Arafat, the then leader of the PLO, was establishing himself as the de facto ruler of large parts of the country, and Jumblatt was determined to transform Lebanese politics by ending the supremacy of the Maronites and the “Christian Right” as it was then called.This was the moment when Gemayel rose to power. He organized his followers, attracted thousands of young Christian Lebanese around him, obtained funds and arms from near and far, and fought tenaciously and brutally to promote his cause. The blood that was spilled as a result included that of many Christian Maronites, particularly those from rival political dynasties. He was, in a slight distortion of the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche’s idea, a perfect example of the “will to power”.However, for many, Gemayel’s most memorable decision was to ally himself with Israel. Perhaps he and the Christian Maronite leaders of the time who supported him felt they had no other option. They felt they were facing an existential threat, and indeed at one moment in 1976–1977 Jumblatt, supported by Palestinian forces, was on the verge of dealing the Maronites and the Christian Right a devastating defeat.It was only the categorical refusal of then Syrian president Hafez Al-Assad to allow such a defeat to take place that gave the Christian Right another chance in the fight.Gemayel seized the opportunity that Syria had provided him, but he calculated that Israel could help him more. He became the political darling of then Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin and a close friend of future Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon. It was Gemayel’s alliance with Israel that spearheaded the latter’s invasion of Lebanon in 1982, which ended the presence of the PLO in the country and secured him the Lebanese presidency.Many who worked closely with Gemayel say that he intended to enforce the withdrawal of Israeli and Syrian forces from Lebanon, to strengthen the institutions of the state by eliminating all the militias including the one he had himself set up, and to forge a new governing structure for the country, one that would reconcile all Lebanese to the notion of a unified state.Perhaps he did indeed intend to do these things. But his rule did not last long enough for these intentions to be translated into facts on the ground.Interestingly, outside Lebanon, Gemayel was then quickly dispatched to the margins of history. Even in Israel, although Sharon continued to consider him as a dear friend, Lebanon-focused analysts at Israel’s external intelligence agency Mossad held derogatory views of his character.Inside Lebanon, however, Gemayel lives on as a symbol. For some, he is an icon of the Maronite presence and determination to sustain their understanding of the idea of modern Lebanon. For others, he symbolizes a quintessentially narrow identity that could never be reconciled with those of the other major communities living in the country.Symbols matter, because they shape people’s collective psyche. But symbols also distort history. This is particularly problematic in Lebanon because the inherent sectarian tensions and opposing views about the essence of the Lebanese project, the Lebanese idea, remain not far beneath the surface and the decay of the state over recent decades.Liberating Gemayel’s legacy from the symbols and legends surrounding him, and subjecting it to serious assessment, could be the beginning of forging a new understanding among all Lebanese of their history over the past 40 years.Blurring emotions into false historicity will only propagate the confinement of the Lebanese psyche into conflicting narratives of imagined versions of the past. The result would be a clash of identities that could ultimately seek diverging futures.Tarek Osman is the author of Islamism: A History of Political Islam (2017) and Egypt on the Brink (2010).

    "Sabra and Shatila massacre: What happened in Lebanon in 1982?": "Israeli-backed Phalange militia killed between 2,000 and 3,500 Palestinian refugees and Lebanese civilians in two days.\n\nIt was one of the most harrowing massacres committed in the Lebanese civil war, a conflict known for its brutality.\n\nShatila, a Palestinian refugee camp, and the adjacent neighbourhood of Sabra are located southwest of Lebanon’s capital city Beirut.\n\nThe refugees were victims of the 1948 Nakba, or “catastrophe” in Arabic, fleeing the violent ethnic cleansing of Palestine by Zionist militias as Israel was formed.\n\nBut between September 16 and 18, 1982, the refugees, now living in Shatila and Sabra, along with Lebanese civilians, were attacked by a right-wing Lebanese militia, in coordination with the Israeli army.\n\nBetween 2,000 and 3,500 people were killed.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nIn June 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon during the country’s 15-year civil war (1975-1990), with the stated aim of destroying the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which had been based in Beirut and was launching attacks on Israel from southern Lebanon.\n\nThe PLO withdrew from Lebanon by September 1, 1982. Assurances were provided by the United States and a multi-national force that the remaining Palestinian refugees and civilians would be protected.\n\nTwo weeks later, the Israeli military besieged Sabra and Shatila and provided cover for their allies, a right-wing Lebanese militia called the Phalange, to carry out the mass killings.\n\nThe killing continued for 43 hours, from 6pm on Thursday, 16 September, until 1pm on Saturday, 18 September.\n\nWhile accurate figures on the number of people killed are difficult to ascertain, estimates have put the death toll at between 2,000-3,500 civilians.\n\nTestimonies from the mass killing describe horrific acts of slaughter, mutilation, rape and mass graves. Images from the aftermath were aired on television worldwide and caused global outrage.\n\nWhat led to this?\n\nMore than 100,000 Palestinians, mostly from the northern areas of historic Palestine, were expelled and fled to Lebanon during the 1948 Nakba.\n\nThe PLO, an umbrella of Palestinian political parties created in 1964 with the aim of liberating Palestine through armed struggle, moved its base of operations to Beirut after it was pushed out of Jordan in 1970.\n\nIn 1969, an Egyptian-brokered agreement between the PLO and the Lebanese army, the PLO’s Armed Struggle Command assumed control over the 16 Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon, enabling it to carry out operations on Israel from southern Lebanon.\n\nThe Lebanese civil war broke out in 1975 mainly between the Lebanese Front (LF) – a coalition of right-wing Christian Maronite parties backed by Israel and the United States – and the Lebanese National Movement (LNM), a coalition of secular leftists, pan-Arab Sunni and Shia Muslims, and the PLO. Syria also invaded.\n\nIsraeli forces, led by then-Defence Minister Ariel Sharon, invaded Lebanon in June 1982, laid siege to Beirut and heavily bombarded the city, where the PLO headquarters were located.\n\nThe multinational force that arrived after the PLO’s withdrawal from Beirut on September 1 was supposed to stay for 30 days. However, they pulled out early, on September 10.\n\nOn September 14, 1982, Bachir Gemayel, the Lebanese president-elect and leader of the Lebanese Forces, was assassinated in Beirut.\n\nThe next morning, Israel invaded west Beirut and prevented anyone from exiting the refugee camps. Israeli forces then allowed the Phalange, who blamed the PLO for Gemayel’s death, to enter Sabra and Shatila and carry out the massacre.\n\nWhat followed?\n\nThe United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution declaring the massacre an “act of genocide”.\n\nThe PLO moved its headquarters to Tunisia before the 1993 Oslo Accords were signed with Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA) was created.\n\nThe Sabra and Shatila massacre is remembered as one of the most traumatic events in Palestinian history and its memory is commemorated annually by Palestinians in Lebanon and in Palestine.\n\nThe event continues to highlight the plight of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon today, who now number 479,000, according to the UN.\n\nAbout 45 percent of them live in the country’s 12 refugee camps, which suffer from overcrowding, poor housing conditions, unemployment, poverty and lack of access to basic services and legal aid.\n\nPalestinians in Lebanon are banned from working in as many as 39 professions, cannot own property, and face numerous other restrictions.\n\nWho was held accountable?",

    "Lebanon Flotilla Rallies at Israel Sea Border Ahead of Talks": "Lebanese protesters Sunday sailed down the country’s coast in dozens of fishing boats and yachts toward Israel, days before a U.S. envoy is expected in Beirut to continue mediating in a maritime border dispute between the two countries.\n\nLebanon and Israel, which have been officially at war since the latter's creation in 1948, both claim an area of some 860 square kilometers (330 square miles) of the Mediterranean Sea. Lebanon hopes to exploit offshore gas reserves as it grapples with the worst economic crisis in its modern history. Lebanon and Israel kicked off maritime border talks almost two years ago.\n\nSunday's flotilla carried Lebanese flags and banners, with slogans in Arabic, French, and Hebrew expressing what they say is Lebanon’s right to its maritime oil and gas fields.\n\n“We are demanding our right to every inch of our waters,” Aya Saleh, one of the protesters on a fishing boat, told The Associated Press. “And we are sending a message from the Lebanese people.”\n\nLebanese and Israel navy vessels were present, though no tensions occurred.\n\nAmos Hochstein, a senior adviser for energy security at the U.S. State Department, has shuttled between Beirut and Jerusalem to mediate the talks. He was last in Beirut in July, when he informed Lebanese officials of Israel's response to a proposal Lebanon made in June, and signaled optimism after his trip.\n\nAccording to Lebanese President Michel Aoun’s office, Hochstein notified adviser and deputy parliament speaker, Elias Bou Saab, that he will visit Beirut later this week. Lebanese media have speculated that both countries could soon reach an agreement.\n\nHowever, tensions between Lebanon's Iran-backed militant Shiite group Hezbollah and Israel have also simmered in recent months surrounding the border talks.\n\nThe Israeli military in early July shot down three Hezbollah unarmed drones flying over the disputed Karish gas field in the Mediterranean.\n\nLebanese caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati criticized Hezbollah, saying the move could pose risks to the country. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in an interview that month said the militant group can locate and strike Karish and any other Israeli gas field.",
