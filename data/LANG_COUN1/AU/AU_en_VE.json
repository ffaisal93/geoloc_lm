    "Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)": "CARLOS FARÍA TORTOSA, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Venezuela , spoke against the campaign to discredit and stigmatize his country for challenging neoliberal globalization and its opposition to the modern version of colonialization. The aim of this campaign, he elaborated, is to create political and economic conditions which prevent alternatives to capitalism’s imperialist and predatory system. Accused of being a dictatorship and a failed State, Venezuela has experienced attempts to destabilize its democracy including assassination, invasion, seditious movements and a parallel government, 913 sanctions and the theft of its foreign assets. Denouncing the sanctions as crimes against humanity, he proclaimed they “have never been able to break the will of our people”. Such acts of piracy have, however, left a deep wound. While political propaganda points to forced migration as an example, he noted that 60 per cent of Venezuela’s migrants return voluntarily because of exploitation, mistreatment and persecution in other countries. Urging accountability over the “millions of resources that were supposed to be there to help Venezuelan migrants”, he called upon multilateral organizations to guarantee the rights of all migrants around the world and warned all of the outbreak of xenophobia, the rejection of the poor, hate crimes, hate speech and intolerance.\n\nInstead of surrendering to the conditions imposed upon its people, Venezuela is working towards social peace and has implemented an economic plan to open up new sources of wealth through tourism, industrialization, entrepreneurship and farming development. Expressing concern over the impact of various global conflicts on food security, he shared his country’s stance that the only way to overcome global hunger and poverty is through a return to sustainable agriculture. Venezuela will help other countries and, as an Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) member, wants to assist in the current energy emergency.\n\nUrging countries to prioritize diplomacy and dialogue over military confrontation, he pledged his country’s support for an international commission to facilitate dialogue between the Russian Federation and Ukraine. Venezuela rejects all military provocation and economic sanctions against the Russian Federation and the hate campaign against the Slavic people. He attributed the loss of trust in the international community to the United States’ 2001 invasion of Afghanistan and referenced the imperialism and supremacism which led to unnecessary bloodshed in Iraq, Haiti, Yemen, Somalia, Libya and Syria and continues to lay waste to international law. Warning of the rise of a global security surveillance state which deprives citizens of privacy and turns democracies into “infocracies”, he called for the defence of truth and the application of reason and common sense as the antidote to collapse. The North, he continued, “must recognize that the unipolar, colonialist system cannot adequately respond to the problems and needs that they themselves have created [in] harming humanity, animal life and the planet” and must accept new Powers and new leadership of China, the Russian Federation, India, Iran and Türkiye. Venezuela hopes the Assembly recognizes and respects the peoples of the world, addresses the injustices against the Saharawi people and the Palestinian people, puts an end to illegal economic sanctions and political persecution against Nicaragua, Cuba, Iran and the Russian Federation and helps Argentina regain sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands*.",

    "Humanitarian Assistance to Respond to the Venezuela Regional Crisis - Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)": "The United States announced today nearly $376 million in new humanitarian assistance to respond to the needs of vulnerable Venezuelans in Venezuela, Venezuelan refugees and migrants, and their generous host communities across the region. This announcement makes good on our commitments under the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection and demonstrates our solidarity with the Venezuelan people and our ongoing commitment to strengthening the international response to this crisis. This humanitarian assistance includes more than $181 million through the State Department’s Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration and more than $194 million through the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\nOur assistance supports the most vulnerable among the more than 7 million Venezuelans with critical needs inside Venezuela, the nearly 6.8 million who have sought refuge in 17 countries across the region, and the host communities that have welcomed them.

    "Venezuela: Humanitarian Response Plan 2022 - 2023 (August 2022) - Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)": "Part 1:\n\nResponse Plan Overview\n\nTARGET POPULATION 5.2M\n\nREQUIREMENTS (US$) - 2022 $795M\n\nOPERATING PARTNERS 125\n\nPROJECTS 145\n\nThe 2022-2023 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) provides the framework for action in Venezuela and aims to respond to the priorities established and presented in the plan. It focuses on providing assistance and strengthening the provision of essential services, livelihoods, and protection, as prioritized by level of vulnerability.\n\nAccording to the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and Caribbean (ECLAC) estimates, 2021 saw Venezuela close a cycle of accelerated recession following a cumulative contraction of 75 per cent in the last eight years. While in 2022 the economy is expected to grow, it will take time for this to result in significant improvements in access to basic services, restored livelihoods, and reduced protection risks.\n\nThus, the HRP seeks to address the most pressing needs by focusing on six priority areas: public health, nutrition, food security and livelihoods, human mobility, protection risks, the provision of and access to services, and access to education.\n\nThe multi-year plan’s activities and projects also seek to build capacities at the institutional, community, and individual levels to improve the provision of essential services, restore livelihoods, and strengthen resilience and the capacity to recover of the most vulnerable people. This is particularly important in a context where the economy stabilized in 2021 and moderate growth is expected for 2022. The focus of the HRP, as outlined in the sectoral plans, seeks to promote the link between humanitarian action and development, including actions that may help Venezuela achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). With its focus on assisting the most vulnerable population, humanitarian action is an instrument that contributes to sustainable development under the fundamental premise of leaving no one behind.\n\nThe HRP 2022-2023 has been developed under the framework of the UN General Assembly Resolution 46/182, that respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity and national unity of States, with assistance provided in line with the humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, independence and neutrality. In this regard, all the humanitarian organizations that are part of the Plan are committed to the Joint Operating Principles for Venezuela (see annex) and the national legal framework. The humanitarian response places the most vulnerable population at its center and considers the needs differentiated by age group, gender, and diversity.\n\nThis document has been prepared by the Inter-Cluster Coordination Group (ICCG), under the supervision of the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT). It is based on consultations since the end of 2021 with the authorities of the Government of Venezuela, as well as other key stakeholders.\n\nBased on demonstrated operational capacity, HRP partners will seek to assist 5.2 million people over the next two years, including 50 per cent women and girls and 50 per cent men and boys. Children and adolescents represent 40 per cent of the target population. Most of the plan’s activities will take place in eight states: Amazonas, Apure, Bolivar, Delta Amacuro, Falcon, Miranda, Sucre, and Zulia. The geographic prioritization will be revised periodically and coordinated with the national authorities.\n\nGiving continuity to the previous HRPs, the three strategic objectives of the 2022-2023 plan are:1) contribute to the well-being of the prioritized population by age group, gender, and diversity through a multisectoral humanitarian response and with a rights-based approach; 2) reduce vulnerability and strengthen recovery capacities and resilience of the prioritized population by age group, gender, and diversity; and, 3) strengthen institutional and community mechanisms to prevent, mitigate, and respond to the protection risks of the prioritized population. These three objectives will be promoted in line with humanitarian principles, a rights-based approach and gender equality.\n\nAdditionally, the HRP will seek to promote preparedness, risk mitigation, and response to natural or man-made disasters. In 2021, Venezuela experienced heavy rains and floods that affected some 95 municipalities. With forecasts that climate change will continue to affect weather patterns, there is a need to complement the State’s efforts, both in response to these situations and in building capacity for preparedness and risk mitigation, integrating gender and intersectoral approaches.\n\nThe 2022-2023 HRP seeks to achieve these objectives through 145 projects carried out by 125 organizations (United Nations agencies and national and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs)). These work in a coordinated manner through eight Clusters and two Areas of Responsibility (AoR), under the leadership of the HCT, and in coordination with the national authorities and in line with the national legal framework.\n\nImplementing these projects requires mobilizing US$795 million in 2022. Efforts are ongoing with the donor community to facilitate resource mobilization and rapidly increase funding for the response. The plan´s implementation also requires maximum support from and coordination with the authorities to increase its impact.\n\nThe HRP´s objectives and approach will be the basis for the response in 2022 and 2023, with an update of the plan scheduled for the end of 2022 to revise the projects and financial requirements for 2023, considering possible changes in the context.",

Four years later, we are now on our feet producing and we have a very good export offer for the people of Colombia,” the Venezuelan president added.\n\nSource: Telesurenglish.net\n\nICS Brings Venezuela’s Economic Recovery To Light\n\nThese data were released today by the head of the ICS, Juan Villamizar, who reported the results of a survey showing that 57.3 percent of Venezuelans believe the country’s economy is recovering.\n\nOf the 1 225 people surveyed in 22 states across the country between August 8 and 12, 30.1 percent see the progress of the economic recovery as certain and 27.2 percent see it as somewhat certain. 16.2 percent believe it is somewhat false and 24.2 percent believe it is false in its entirety, according to the ICS chief’s statements.\n\nA 51.5 percent attributed the growth of the economy to the President Nicolás Maduro’s management and 40.4 percent to entrepreneurs, businessmen, remittances, foreign investment, traders and exports.\n\nSource: Telesurenglish.net\n\nMinister Says That Venezuela Ready To Sell Oil Worldwide\n\n“That if it is the Serbian Government or it is the U.S. Government, or it is any Government of the world or any country, even, or any company of any country, because there are also private companies that may be interested in buying crude, excellent,” the official answered when consulted by Sputnik Agency in a press conference.\n\nAt the end of June, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic admitted that his nation must find alternatives to Russian oil due to supply difficulties associated with Western sanctions against Moscow for its special military operation in Ukraine, so he considered Venezuela as an option to supply its market.\n\nMeanwhile, President Nicolás Maduro said in mid-August that in one year, the country could increase its oil production to 3 million barrels per day and stressed that the growth projection is maintained despite the sanctions imposed by the United States in 2017.\n\nAccording to the Government, the sanctions against state-owned Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) prevent any transaction in that country’s financial system, from financing to the purchase of spare parts or maintenance contracting.\n\nIn this sense, the Minister said that the limitations for commercializing Venezuelan crude oil in the international market are associated with the sanctions imposed on PDVSA by the U.S. Government.\n\nFurthermore, El Aissami asserted that there is no internal legal mechanism in the country that limits the commercialization of crude worldwide; he insisted that this is the nature of the state-owned oil industry.\n\nSource: Telesurenglish.net\n\nPresident Maduro Rejects Attack Against Cristina Fernandez\n\nVenezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro strongly repudiated the attack against Argentina’s Vice President Cristina Fernandez-Kirchner, whom a man tried to shoot around her home on Thursday night.\n\n“We send our solidarity to VP Cristina Fernandez-Kirchner in the face of the attempt on her life. We strongly repudiate this action, which seeks to destabilize the peace of the brotherly Argentine people. The Great Homeland is with you, comrade!”, Maduro tweeted.\n\nMinutes earlier, Venezuelan Foreign Affairs Minister Carlos Faria posted a message expressing on behalf of his country the repudiation of the attack against the Argentine vice president.\n\n“From the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, we repudiate the nefarious attack against Cristina Fernandez-Kirchner by an individual who tried, in vain, to shoot her. We reject this act of violence and we stand in solidarity with the brave Cristina.

    "For asylum seekers, Manhattan is only part of a harrowing journey": "“We have clients that wait four, five, six years for an asylum hearing,” said Schulman.\n\nGonzalez is mindful of employment.\n\nHe will need to obtain a work authorization. Although he initially said he’d take whatever work he could get – construction, or sales in a store ideally – in a follow-up interview he declined any questions about work.\n\nHora said that in her experience, immigration judges did not penalize asylum applicants if it was clear they’d worked before they were legally allowed to, reasoning that it was a necessity.\n\n“No judges ever said anything,” said Hora. “No asylum officer.”\n\nWhat judges do care about, she said, is something known as “good moral character,” or GMC for short. She advises her clients to pay their taxes in order to establish their GMC. In lieu of having a Social Security number, some immigrants do so through use of an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number.\n\nFor Gonzalez and others arriving in the U.S., Hora said obtaining work, lawful or not, is not challenging.\n\n“Employers are getting desperate,” she said. “They need someone to hire right now.”\n\nAlthough Gonzalez is tight-lipped about his job prospects, he’s clear about his obligations.\n\n“Everything in our country is really bad,” he said, and his hope is that he can help his family back home.\n\nThat includes his youngest daughter, who is about to turn 11 and whose name is tattooed on his upper arm. He asks her to be patient, reminding her that “everything is a process, so I'm going through the process.”\n\nThe Darien Gap\n\nGonzalez’s journey to the U.S. took two months, and involved seven or eight days traversing the Darien Gap, a notoriously dangerous stretch of Colombia and Panama, where many travelers have succumbed to the rough terrain or violence.\n\n“It’s the most dangerous jungle in the world,” Gonzalez said, citing the lawlessness as well as the crocodiles, venomous snakes, and other wild animals.\n\nDuring this time, the trio rarely slept, his nephew said, relying on the sugar rush from a constant supply of sweets and candies to stay alert. He was especially concerned for the safety of his girlfriend. They declined to be identified in this story for fear of jeopardizing their asylum claims.\n\nThe young woman said she’d left high school at the age of 16 due to Venezuela's economic crisis, which caused the country's economy to contract by 80%, pushed its inflation to the highest levels in the world, and rendered its currency almost worthless, with government workers earning the equivalent of $1.50 per month. She spent much of the last five years outside of Venezuela, working at various jobs including a restaurant in Peru and a cell phone store in Colombia.\n\n“I came to this country because of the economy,” she said, “to get a better future for myself and my family.”\n\nHer boyfriend had his own problems. He was the oldest of four brothers and wanted to help his mother, whose health had declined, but his part-time job at a store only brought in $10 a week.",

    "Office of High Commissioner Describes a Climate of Repression in Belarus, a Deterioration of the Human Rights Situation, Serious Violations, and Rampant Impunity": "Human Rights Council Concludes Interactive Dialogue with the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine\n\nNada Al-Nashif, Acting United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, this afternoon updated the Human Rights Council on the Office of the High Commissioner’s examination of the situation of human rights in Belarus, saying that two years on from the August 2020 contested presidential elections, the climate of repression continued with a deterioration of the human rights situation, involving serious violations of civil and political rights, and rampant impunity.\n\nMs. Al-Nashif said the Office’s examination showed a massive crackdown on civil society, the media, political opposition, and trade unions, as well as on the exercise of the rights to freedom of expression, association, peaceful assembly, and participation in public affairs.\n\nSince the last update in March, Ms. Al-Nashif said the number of detained people on what the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights had reasonable grounds to believe were politically motivated charges grew to 1,296, from 1,085 as reported in March. This included opposition candidates, political activists, human rights defenders, trade union activists, journalists and protesters. Authorities had raided the premises of civil society organizations and the homes of human rights defenders, undertaking arbitrary arrests and detention.\n\nIn addition, Ms. Al-Nashif said that trials against members of the political opposition, civil society activists, protestors, persons arrested near to protests, and journalists, were conducted in closed hearings, lacking respect for due process and the right to a fair trial. Of particular concern were amendments brought to the Criminal Code extending the death penalty to “attempts to carry out acts of terrorism and murders of government officials or public figures”. Dozens of political activists had already been charged with these crimes. Ms. Al-Nashif urged an immediate moratorium on the use of the death penalty.\n\nBelarus, speaking as a country concerned, said once again there had been a presentation that was not only far removed from reality, but deliberately distorted, leaving a sovereign State no other choice but to ignore it. Belarus would abide by the principles of impartiality and neutrality. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights should instead investigate the presidential elections that took place in the United States, and issue similar reports. The sources and authors of the report were one.\n\nBelarus said that people who broke the law were handed down sentences by the Courts, for specific offences or crimes. The report did not mention those who were pardoned, or those who walked free, or the upcoming amnesty. Belarus was carrying out constitutional transformations calmly and peacefully. Belarus welcomed all States to determine their own path of development.\n\nIn the ensuing discussion, some speakers said the human rights situation in Belarus was appalling. There were currently more than 1,300 political prisoners behind bars, and the authorities continued imprisoning and torturing persons for exercising their human rights, including their right to freedom of expression. The authorities had developed a widespread system of repression. Without a functioning independent judicial system, basic human rights such as the right to peaceful assembly and protest as well as the freedom of expression could not be protected and thus could not be realised.\n\nOther speakers said the report was part a dangerous trend, namely interference in the sovereign affairs of a State, and was part of an attempt to manipulate the Human Rights Council in a context of political interest, demonising a sovereign State, aiming for forced political change. The selected targeting of countries was unacceptable.\n\nSpeaking in the interactive debate were Estonia on behalf of a group of the Nordic-Baltic countries, Luxembourg on behalf of a group of countries, European Union, Finland, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Norway, Switzerland, France, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Ireland, Germany, Australia, Cuba, Austria, Venezuela, Malta, Russian Federation, China, Syrian Arab Republic, Czech Republic, Iceland, Estonia, United States, United Kingdom, Romania, Denmark, Republic of Moldova, Slovakia, Poland, Bulgaria, Sweden, Malawi, Albania, Latvia, Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe, Turkmenistan, Iran, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Lebanon, Nicaragua, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Cambodia, Ukraine, and Tajikistan.\n\nAlso speaking were the Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights, as well as the following non-governmental organizations: Conscience and Peace Tax International, Centre for Reproductive Rights Inc., Human Rights House Foundation, World Federation of Ukrainian Women's Organizations, Advocates for Human Rights, and International Commission of Jurists.\n\nAt the beginning of the meeting, the Council concluded its interactive dialogue with the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine.\n\nIn concluding remarks, Pablo de Greiff, member of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, said the Commission was committed to the protection of the confidentiality and safety of victims, and understood the process of accountability to include measures that improved the conditions of victims.\n\nJasminka Džumhu, Member of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, said the international community should provide assistance and support for victims, with a database for witnesses and a strengthening of forensic capacities.\n\nErik Møse, Chair of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, said concerning forced deportation and filtration, the Commission would pursue these issues. On access to other territories, it would go into Izium, and would seek access to the occupied territories.\n\nIn the discussion, some speakers noted that there had been unlawful attacks on civilians and unlawful airstrikes on civilian infrastructure which amounted to war crimes. There had been a large rise in enforced disappearance committed by the Russian Federation. Those guilty of crimes needed to be held accountable. All parties to the conflict needed to respect international human rights law and protect civilians.\n\nSpeaking in the dialogue were Ukrainian Parliamentary Commission for Human Rights, as well as the following non-governmental organizations: Conscience and Peace Tax International, Centre for Reproductive Rights, Inc., Human Rights House Foundation, World Federation of Ukrainian Women's Organizations, Child Rights Connect, International Bar Association, International Fellowship of Reconciliation, Amnesty International, World Organization against Torture, and iuventum e.V..\n\nThe webcast of the Human Rights Council meetings can be found here. All meeting summaries can be found here. Documents and reports related to the Human Rights Council’s fifty-first regular session can be found here.\n\nAt the end of the meeting, the Council met in private to discuss its complaint procedure.\n\nThe Council will next meet in public at 10 a.m. on Monday, 26 September when it will hold an interactive dialogue with the independent international fact-finding mission on the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. It will then hear the High Commissioner’s oral update on the human rights situation in Myanmar, followed by a general debate on its agenda item four on human rights situations that require the Council’s attention.\n\nInteractive Dialogue with the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine\n\nThe interactive dialogue with the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine started in the previous meeting and a summary can be found here.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn the discussion, many speakers welcomed the mandate of the Commission of Inquiry and thanked it for its work. There had been unlawful attacks by Russian on Ukrainian civilians and unlawful airstrikes on civilian infrastructure which amounted to war crimes. One speaker said that there had been a large rise in cases of enforced disappearances committed by the Russian Federation. Several persons had died as a result of torture in Russian detention facilities. Another speaker expressed concerns about recently uncovered mass graves.\n\nA speaker raised serious concerns about the forced deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia. Such children had limited ability to contact their families in Ukraine. Efforts to protect child rights needed to be prioritised.\n\nThe international community needed to support efforts to investigate war crimes, some speakers said. Those guilty of crimes needed to be held accountable. Civil society needed to continue to speak up about the atrocities being committed. The Commission should establish an international tribunal to hold Russian perpetrators of human rights abuses to account, one speaker said. All parties to the conflict needed to respect international human rights law and protect civilians. Some speakers called for the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine.\n\nA number of speakers noted that all men in Russia faced the prospect of military call-up. Such action had only been taken in Russia once before by Stalin in 1930. The right to conscientious objection to military service should be respected.\n\nA speaker said that women and girls faced barriers to accessing sexual and reproductive health care. States were obliged to ensure access to such services and provide appropriate rehabilitation for survivors of sexual violence. Humanitarian organizations needed support in providing such services.\n\nNuclear power plants had been taken hostage in the war, increasing the risk of nuclear disaster, a speaker said. Such actions were unacceptable in food producing regions, and were of deep concern.\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nPABLO DE GREIFF, Member of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, said concerning the Commission’s understanding of a victim-centred approach, the Commission was committed to the protection of the confidentiality and safety of victims, and understood the process of accountability to include measures that improved the conditions of victims. The notion of accountability was broad, and the Commission was committed to judicial accountability, but also made recommendations as to things that victims needed, probably immediately. This would come up in the next report in March.\n\nJASMINKA DŽUMHU, Member of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, said that concerning what could be done to make the situation better, the international community should provide assistance and support for victims, with a database for witnesses and a strengthening of forensic capacities. A focus would also be put on children with special needs and women.\n\nERIK MØSE, Chair of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, said concerning forced deportation and filtration, the Commission would pursue these issues. On access to other territories, it would go into Izium, and would seek access to the occupied territories. The Commission appreciated the support of the Human Rights Council and would look into its suggestions.\n\nInteractive Dialogue on the Update of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the Situation of Human Rights in Belarus\n\nPresentation\n\nNADA AL-NASHIF, Acting High Commissioner for Human Rights, updating the Human Rights Council on the Office of the High Commissioner’s examination of the situation of human rights in Belarus, said two years on from the August 2020 contested presidential elections in Belarus, the climate of repression continued with a deterioration of the human rights situation, involving serious violations of civil and political rights, and rampant impunity. The Office had observed a massive crackdown on civil society, the media, political opposition, and trade unions, as well as on the exercise of the rights to freedom of expression, association, peaceful assembly, and participation in public affairs.\n\nSince the last update in March, the number of detained people on what the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights had reasonable grounds to believe were politically motivated charges grew to 1,296, from 1,085 as reported in March. This included opposition candidates, political activists, human rights defenders, trade union activists, journalists and protesters. Authorities had raided the premises of civil society organizations and the homes of human rights defenders, undertaking arbitrary arrests and detention.\n\nSince August 2020, at least 370 organizations had made the difficult choice of closing their doors to avoid potentially facing criminal charges. Over 634 organizations were in the process of dissolution by the authorities, including virtually all human rights groups. In July 2022, the Supreme Court dissolved the Belarusian Congress of Democratic Trade Unions along with its four member organizations, effectively dismantling the independent trade union movement. Almost all independent media outlets were labelled as “extremist formations” and banned. Hundreds of social media channels and blogs had also been banned.\n\nMs. Al-Nashif said that between 9 August 2020 and 1 July 2022, more than 11,000 criminal cases were opened related to “extremism”, with penalties foreseen of up to 10 years imprisonment. There were reports of individuals facing such charges merely for subscribing to groups in social networks or Telegram channels. These measures raised serious concerns about compliance with the principles of legality, necessity, and proportionality. Trials against members of the political opposition, civil society activists, protestors, persons arrested near to protests, and journalists, were conducted in closed hearings, lacking respect for due process and the right to a fair trial.\n\nOf particular concern were amendments brought to the Criminal Code extending the death penalty to “attempts to carry out acts of terrorism and murders of government officials or public figures”. Dozens of political activists had already been charged with these crimes. Ms. Al-Nashif urged an immediate moratorium on the use of the death penalty, as a step towards the legal abolition of the death penalty, along with a clear timeline for a comprehensive review thereof.\n\nNo genuine and impartial investigations into allegations of torture and cases of deaths were being conducted in Belarus. The Office continued to receive credible reports of authorities harassing and intimidating those seeking justice in relation to such allegations.\n\nTens of thousands of people had been forced to flee to neighbouring countries. There were also reports of seizures of assets, and unlawful evictions of relatives of those who left the country.\n\nMs. Al-Nashif called on the Government of Belarus to grant unhindered access to the Office to best enable it to discharge the Council’s mandate. She also called on the Government to immediately release all prisoners arrested, charged or sentenced on politically motivated grounds, and cease all other ongoing human rights violations, including the systematic repression of civil society, independent media, and opposition groups. Prompt, effective, transparent, and independent investigations into all past human rights violations or crimes under national or international law were needed, with the provision of appropriate remedies. The international community should pursue its calls to the Government to meet its international human rights obligations, including combatting impunity.\n\nThe Office would present a detailed report and recommendations at the next session of the Council.\n\nStatement by Country Concerned\n\nBelarus, speaking as a country concerned, said once again there had been a presentation that was not only far removed from reality, but deliberately distorted, leaving a sovereign State no other choice but to ignore it. Belarus would abide by the principles of impartiality and neutrality. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights should instead investigate the presidential elections that took place in the United States, and issue similar reports. The sources and authors of the report were one. The report created the impression that the human rights entrepreneurs were vying with each other so as to vilify Belarus as much as possible.\n\nBelarus had people who broke the law, and they were handed down sentences by the Courts, for specific offences or crimes. The report did not mention those who were pardoned, or those who walked free, or the upcoming amnesty. Law enforcement officers did not differ from those in Western countries when upholding law and order, except for the restrained use of tear gas and water cannons in Belarus, where they were only used rarely, unlike in the West. The situation of the United Nations human rights work was now an open subjugation of an entire system to the task of eradicating pluralism and variety, an open intention of the West, which sought to make pariahs out of unruly States, in blatant violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nBelarus was not erecting barbed wire fences to keep migrants out, and was not closing its borders and destroying regular contact between people. The opportunity to enter Belarus freely was ever expanding. What fostered friendly relations between peoples and nations was not iron curtains, nor the sowing of chaos in their countries. Belarus had not yet become another experiment of democracy - it was carrying out constitutional transformations calmly and peacefully. Belarus welcomed all States to determine their own path of development.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn the ensuing discussion, some speakers said the human rights situation in Belarus was appalling. There were currently more than 1,300 political prisoners behind bars, and the authorities continued imprisoning and torturing persons for exercising their human rights, including their right to freedom of expression. The authorities had developed a widespread system of repression, and also targeted national minorities, mostly from Lithuania and Poland, with the exception of Russians. The crucial work of human rights defenders, non-governmental organizations and media was hampered by systematic repression. Some speakers said that all restrictive laws must be revoked. Belarus should take appropriate steps to ensure a fully functioning, independent judicial system and to address impunity.\n\nAccountability and the rule of law were an imperative cornerstone of a democracy. Without a functioning independent judicial system, basic human rights such as the right to peaceful assembly and protest as well as the right to freedom of expression could not be protected and thus could not be realised. The absence of an independent judicial system left room for human rights violations, including torture and other ill-treatment. The Belarusian regime should understand that lasting political stability could not be secured by violating human rights. Many speakers called on the Belarusian authorities to stop its brutal crackdown, release all political prisoners, and choose the path of dialogue instead of violence.\n\nBelarus should respect, protect, and fulfil human rights in compliance with its obligations under international human rights law, and fully adhere to the principles of democracy and the rule of law. Some speakers urged the Belarusian authorities to immediately and unconditionally release all political prisoners, including human rights defenders, journalists, and persons belonging to national and other minorities, and cease harassment and reprisals against individuals exercising their human rights.\n\nSome speakers also strongly condemned the human rights consequences of Belarus’ involvement in Russia’s illegal war of aggression against Ukraine and urged Belarusian authorities to adhere fully to its international obligations by stopping this involvement. Some speakers also supported international initiatives to hold all perpetrators of human rights violations in Belarus to account, including through the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Special Rapporteur, and the International Accountability Platform for Belarus, and called on Belarusian authorities to grant these mechanisms access to the country.\n\nA number of speakers said the report was part of a dangerous trend, namely interference in the sovereign affairs of States, and was part of an attempt to manipulate the Human Rights Council in a context of political interest, demonising a sovereign State, aiming for forced political change. The selected targeting of countries was unacceptable. The measures taken by Belarus to protect the constitutional order, protect and promote human rights, and ensure stability and order in the country were commended. The Council should avoid bias, selectivity, politicisation and double standards in human rights.\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nNADA AL-NASHIF, Acting United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights had tried to call attention to the massive crackdown against Belarussian civil society and independent media. It was important that support was extended to non-governmental organizations and journalists. Administrative, technical, and resource support was needed.\n\nThe Office continued to receive testimonials from detainees kept in inhumane conditions. Women were in most cases guarded by male staff. The pleas of detainees for water, food and lavatories were ignored, and detainees were often beaten for complaining. Access of lawyers to clients and files was obstructed. Hearings of high-profile dissidents were closed, and lawyers who had brought cases to United Nations human rights mechanisms were harassed and faced reprisals. There were no effective remedies for victims of these violations, and no efforts were made by authorities to hold perpetrators to account. Such perpetrators needed to be held to account through international fora. Information sharing and the provision of mutual legal assistance was helpful in this regard.\n\nMs. Al-Nashif said the use of lengthy pre-trial detention and the use of solitary confinement was of extreme concern. Belarus needed to provide unhindered access to independent monitors to detention facilities. Belarus also needed to continue to uphold the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. No one should be arbitrarily deprived of their citizenship. States needed to provide safeguards to prevent statelessness.\n\nThe Office was concerned about the crackdown on civil society. It had held regular consultations with members of civil society, who played an important role in documenting violations and providing justice for victims. The responsibility to guarantee the rule of law lay with the authorities of Belarus, and they had failed to live up to those responsibilities. It was important that human rights organizations were encouraged and strengthened through collaboration and support from regional mechanisms.\n\nThe mandate was based in Austria, and although it had not been given access to Belarus, it had conducted interviews and investigations in neighbouring countries.\n\nThe situation of human rights in Belarus had caused many to relocate to Ukraine, and since the start of the war, these people had been forced to relocate once again. The Office was working to document violations in Belarus, and encouraged online submissions through the Office’s webpage. Updated information was at the heart of the mandate’s work. The mandate would continue to consult with victims and ensure a victim-centred approach. A dynamic discussion on themes for the next report was ongoing.\n\n___________\n\nProduced by the United Nations Information Service in Geneva for use of the information media;\n\nnot an official record.

And the region can expect more uncertainty going forward, according to the report, which measured consumer price index, or CPI, changes over the periods December 2020 to December 2021 and June 2021 to June 2022.\n\n“Future inflation patterns in the region are closely linked to global inflation, as their determinants are very similar. For that reason, if the effects of the invasion of Ukraine on prices for raw materials persist, in particular for energy and food, inflation will remain high,” ECLAC said.\n\nVenezuela had the highest inflation levels at 157 per cent, followed by Argentina at 65 per cent and Suriname at 55 per cent. Jamaica’s inflation rate ranks as the third- highest in the Caribbean subregion, behind Haiti at 29.2 per cent and Cuba at 28.9 per cent. Jamaica’s inflation rate at June this year was the highest level of price rise in the English-speaking Caribbean.\n\nThe ECLAC report noted that inflation has affected the majority of countries in the region, with 29 posting increases. Only three economies – Venezuela, Cuba and St Kitts-Nevis – recorded lower inflation.

In 19 of those countries, inflation was higher in 2021 than the average between 2005 and 2019. In 2021, inflation fell in only four countries: Antigua and Barbuda, Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Guatemala and Uruguay. It also increased in the first half of 2022, excepting only three economies, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Cuba and Saint Kitts and Nevis,” the report said.\n\nIt noted too, that in the first six months this year, 28 countries reported an inflation rate that exceeded the averages between January 2005 and December 2019. As of June 2022, the ECLAC report noted, the year-on-year rate was over 10 per cent in 13 countries, and in 20 countries, it had doubled from the previous year’s rate.\n\nLooking at the subregions, the report showed that South America generally had the highest levels of price increases. This is a reality that has led to mass protests and violence in some countries there. Jamaica’s inflation level at June stands out, compared to the average rates across the English-Speaking Caribbean, although ECLAC pointed out that levels of CPI changes were affected by populations and size of economies.\n\n“Although inflationary pressure has been generalised in all the subregions, as of June 2022, the economies of South America show the highest average inflation rate, at 8.7 per cent, followed by Central America and Mexico with a rate of 7.7 per cent, while the economies of the English-speaking Caribbean have the lowest average inflation rate, at 7.4 per cent,” it said.\n\nIn keeping with central bank actions throughout the region, the Bank of Jamaica has utilised a series of measures to curb inflation, with hikes in benchmark interest rates being the most notable. It has also intervened in the foreign exchange market and tightened reserve requirements of deposit-taking institutions to mop up liquidity.\n\nThe ECLAC report noted that at least 11 nations in the region have raised interest rates as a tool to control inflation. Jamaica adjusted its rates by 550 points from 0.5 per cent to 6.0 per cent to date, which generally aligns with the other nations highlighted by ECLAC. Brazil recorded the highest rise in rates at 13.25 per cent in July, after making 11 adjustments from 2.0 per cent a year earlier. Guatemala upped rates 50 basis points to 2.25 per cent from 1.75 a year ago.\n\nHonduras did not adjust its benchmark interest rates over the 12 months to July 2022.\n\n“Authorities have responded to the upturn in inflation by tightening their monetary stance, raising policy rates and dampening growth in monetary aggregates. In March 2021, the Central Bank of Brazil began to raise its monetary policy rate, a decision followed by most of the monetary authorities in the region that opted for inflation targeting. Most of the central banks adopted similar strategies, except for the Central Bank of Honduras, which has left its monetary policy rate unchanged since October 2020. This contrasts with the Central Bank of Peru, which has revised its rate 12 times,” the ECLAC document stated.\n\nbusiness@gleanerjm.com",

    "D.C. Circuit Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act Enforcement Update (September 2022)": "Click for PDF\n\nGibson Dunn’s D.C. Circuit Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act Enforcement Update summarizes recent decisions within the D.C. Circuit that are relevant to the enforcement of judgments and arbitral awards against foreign states.\n\nThis edition summarizes:\n\n(1) the D.C. Circuit’s decision in Estate of Levin v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Nos. 21-7036, 21-7041, 21-7044, 21-7052, 21-7053, 2022 WL 3364493, addressing the attachment of electronic fund transfers (“EFTs”) by victims of state-sponsored terrorism;\n\n(2) the district court’s decision in Chiejina v. Federal Republic of Nigeria, No. 21-2241, 2022 WL 3646377 (D.D.C.), addressing the proper framework that applies when a foreign state opposes enforcement of an arbitral award by disputing the existence of a valid arbitration agreement between the parties; and\n\n(3) the district court’s decisions in ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, No. 19-0683, 2022 WL 3576193 (D.D.C.) and Tethyan Copper Co. PTY Ltd. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan, No. 19-2424, 2022 WL 715215 (D.D.C.), addressing the enforcement of arbitral awards issued pursuant to the International Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (“ICSID Convention”).\n\nD.C. Circuit Opens The Door For Victims Of Terrorism To Attach Blocked Assets Of State Sponsors Of Terrorism\n\nOn August 16, 2022, the D.C. Circuit broke with the Second Circuit and issued a significant decision for victims of terrorism in Estate of Levin v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Nos. 21-7036, 21-7041, 21-7044, 21-7052, 21-7053, 2022 WL 3364493. Ruling in favor of terrorism victims represented by Matt McGill (argued) and Jessica Wagner of Gibson Dunn, the court unanimously reversed the district court’s dissolution of orders of attachment on nearly $10 million in blocked Iranian funds. The decision opens the door for victims of terrorism to attach blocked funds of state sponsors of terrorism under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (“TRIA”) more generally.\n\nBackground\n\nVictims of terrorism often struggle to collect on judgments against state sponsors of terrorism. Even when those states’ funds surface in U.S. financial institutions and are blocked by sanctions laws, sovereign immunity can place them beyond the reach of judgment creditors. To address these enforcement challenges, Congress enacted TRIA, codified at 28 U.S.C. § 1610 Note. This law ensures that when funds of state sponsors of terrorism are blocked by sanctions, those funds remain available for “execution or attachment” by plaintiffs holding judgments against those states—”[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law.” TRIA, § 201(a).\n\nIn order for blocked funds to fall within the protection of TRIA, they must be “blocked assets of” the relevant state or its agency or instrumentality. TRIA, § 201(a). The Second Circuit, however, has adopted a narrow view of ownership in the context of EFTs, in which funds move quickly from one account to another through a series of intermediary banks. Relying on Article 4A of the Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”), the Second Circuit has held that the only entity with an ownership interest in funds blocked at an intermediary bank is the entity immediately preceding that bank in the chain of electronic transfers—even if the chain of transfers was initiated by a state sponsor of terrorism. See Doe v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., 899 F.3d 152 (2d Cir. 2018). Until Levin, however, the D.C. Circuit had not decided this issue.\n\nIn Levin, two groups of terrorism victims—including nearly 90 victims represented by Gibson Dunn (the “Owens victims”)—who hold approximately $1 billion in judgments against the Islamic Republic of Iran obtained writs of attachment against funds blocked at Wells Fargo by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) during an attempted EFT initiated by an agent of Iran seeking to purchase an oil tanker. The United States—which had earlier sought forfeiture of the same funds—intervened and moved to quash the writs. Adopting the Second Circuit’s approach in Doe, the district court granted the government’s motion, holding that the funds were not subject to attachment under TRIA because only the bank immediately preceding Wells Fargo in the chain of transfers held an ownership interest.\n\nDecision\n\nThe D.C. Circuit unanimously reversed, rejecting the Second Circuit’s reliance on UCC Article 4A in favor of a broader rule grounded in tracing principles. The court explained—as Gibson Dunn had argued on behalf of the Owens victims­—that “[w]hile [Article 4A] seeks to minimize disruptions in electronic funds transfers, OFAC’s blocking does the opposite—its purpose is to disrupt terrorist [EFTs].” Given this mismatch, the court concluded that Article 4A is a poor fit for determining ownership of blocked EFTs. Instead, the court held that ownership should be determined according to tracing principles: under TRIA, “terrorist victims may attach OFAC blocked electronic funds transfers if those funds can be traced to a terrorist owner,” and “no intermediary or upstream bank asserts an interest as an innocent third party.”\n\nJudge Pillard filed a concurrence arguing that a tracing rule—which accounts for the funds’ path through the financial system—does not, on its own, accomplish the statutorily required showing of ownership. Judge Pillard would have adopted, “instead of or in addition to tracing,” the common law rule of agency that the Owens victims proposed, which would have treated banks as agents rather than owners when they effectuate EFTs originated by state sponsors of terrorism.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit’s decision has significant implications for judgment enforcement actions brought by victims of terrorism. It clears the way for victims to attach blocked funds that would have been unreachable under the Second Circuit’s rule, and effectuates Congress’ intent to make blocked funds of state sponsors of terrorism available—”notwithstanding any other provision of law”—to victims holding judgments against those states. By creating a circuit split, moreover, the decision may provide an avenue for terrorism victims to challenge the prevailing standard in the Second Circuit.\n\nD.D.C. Reaffirms Arbitrability Disputes Do Not Implicate U.S. Courts’ Jurisdiction\n\nOn August 23, 2022, a district court in the D.C. Circuit issued a decision reaffirming that arbitrability disputes do not implicate subject-matter jurisdiction under the arbitration exception of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (“FSIA”). See Chiejina v. Federal Republic of Nigeria, No. 21-2241, 2022 WL 3646377 (D.D.C. Aug. 23, 2022). In Chiejina, Nigeria opposed confirmation of an arbitration award against it on the grounds that one of the petitioners was not a party to the underlying agreement to arbitrate. Consistent with “every case” the district court has decided on this issue, the court determined that arbitrability disputes such as this one implicate the merits of the petition and not the court’s subject-matter jurisdiction under the FSIA. The court thus denied Nigeria’s motion to dismiss, which means that Nigeria’s arbitrability challenge will have to be litigated at the merits stage under a more deferential standard of review, rather than decided de novo as an issue of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n\nBackground\n\nPetitioners seeking to confirm a foreign arbitral award issued against a foreign state typically must overcome two obstacles. First, under the FSIA, 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a), foreign states are presumptively immune from suit in U.S. court unless one of the FSIA’s enumerated exceptions to jurisdictional immunity is satisfied. One such exception, the FSIA’s arbitration exception, 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(6), provides for subject-matter jurisdiction in an action against a foreign state to “confirm an award made pursuant to” an arbitration agreement. Second, once jurisdiction is established, the petitioner must establish on the merits that the award is subject to confirmation under the applicable legal framework—typically, either the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (the “New York Convention”) or the ICSID Convention. Both Conventions limit a court’s authority to review the merits of the arbitral award or question the determinations of the tribunal that issued it.\n\nTo avoid the New York and ICSID Conventions’ limits on judicial review, foreign states often attempt to frame their challenges to enforcement of an arbitral award as raising issues of subject-matter jurisdiction under the FSIA, rather than the merits. In particular, in a number of recent cases, foreign states have argued that the FSIA’s arbitration exception does not apply—and the state is therefore immune from suit—because there is no valid arbitration agreement between the parties. The D.C. Circuit and the D.D.C. have repeatedly held, however, that issues of “arbitrability”—including the existence of a valid arbitration agreement—go to the merits rather than to subject-matter jurisdiction under the FSIA. See, e.g., LLC SPC Stileks v. Republic of Moldova, 985 F.3d 871, 877-78 (D.C. Cir. 2021); Chevron Corp. v. Ecuador, 795 F.3d 200, 204 (D.C. Cir. 2015).\n\nIn Chiejina, petitioners are seeking to confirm and enforce under the New York Convention a $2.9 million award, plus interest, issued against the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Like the defendants in Stileks, Chevron, and Tethyan, Nigeria moved to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, arguing that the FSIA’s arbitration exception did not apply because one of the petitioners was not a party to the relevant arbitration agreement. Nigeria also argued that the court lacked personal jurisdiction because the petitioners failed to properly effect service of process consistent with the FSIA’s service provision, 28 U.S.C. § 1608(e).\n\nDecision\n\nThe district court rejected Nigeria’s challenge to subject-matter jurisdiction, explaining that under the D.C. Circuit’s decisions in Stileks and Chevron, arbitrability “is a question that goes to the merits of whether the award should be confirmed pursuant to the New York Convention,” rather than “a basis on which to conclude that the Court lacks jurisdiction under the FSIA.” For that reason, Nigeria could not challenge subject-matter jurisdiction by arguing that petitioners’ claims in the arbitration were “not encompassed by the underlying agreement to arbitrate” because one of the petitioners was not a party to that agreement. Instead, the court indicated that it would address arbitrability—including the existence of a valid arbitration agreement between the parties—at the merits stage under the deferential standard for confirmation of foreign arbitral awards under the New York Convention. The decision thus reaffirms the principle that arbitrability is not an issue of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n\nThe court also addressed service of process. When a plaintiff enters into a “special arrangement” for service on a foreign state, the FSIA, 28 U.S.C. § 1608(a)(1), requires the plaintiff to attempt service through that arrangement before proceeding with other methods of service. In Chiejina, the underlying construction contract at issue in the arbitration included a notice provision specifying a method for serving notices related to the contract. Rather than follow that notice provision, the petitioner served Nigeria through a separate method applicable in the absence of a “special arrangement” between the parties. The court held that service was properly effected on Nigeria because the contractual notice provision applied only to notices that were “‘required or authorized’ by the Contract itself,” not service of process in the lawsuit. In doing so, the court reaffirmed the principle that a notice provision in an underlying contract creates a “special arrangement” for purposes of FSIA service “only where the language is ‘all encompassing’ rather than ‘confined to the contract or agreement at issue.’” Berkowitz v. Republic of Costa Rica, 288 F. Supp. 3d. 166, 173 (D.D.C. 2018) (quoting Orange Middle East & Africa v. Republic of Equatorial Guinea, No. 1:15-CV-849 2016 WL 2894857, at *4 (D.D.C. May 18, 2016)).\n\nD.D.C. Reaffirms U.S. Courts’ Obligation To Enforce ICSID Awards\n\nOn August 19, 2022, a district court in the D.C. Circuit issued a decision reaffirming the obligation of U.S. courts to enforce arbitral awards issued pursuant to the ICSID Convention. See ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, No. 1:19-cv-683, 2022 WL 3576193 (D.D.C. Aug. 19, 2022). Consistent with precedent and federal law, the court held that it had subject-matter jurisdiction under both the arbitration and waiver exceptions of the FSIA on account of Venezuela’s decision to join the ICSID Convention. In doing so, the court reaffirmed the principle that a foreign state that joins the ICSID Convention waives immunity to the enforcement of ICSID awards in U.S. court.\n\nBackground\n\nThe ICSID Convention is a treaty signed by the United States and 164 other nations of the world that provides a comprehensive framework for resolving investment disputes between participating nations and the private investors of other participating nations. The Convention provides for arbitration before an international tribunal and streamlined enforcement procedures for any resulting arbitral award. Each contracting party agrees to “recognize an award rendered pursuant to [the] Convention as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by that award within its territories as if it were a final judgment of a court in that State.” ICSID Convention, art. 54(1). The United States has implemented this treaty obligation through legislation providing that an ICSID award “shall be enforced and shall be given the same full faith and credit as if the award were a final judgment of a court of general jurisdiction of one of the several States.” 22 U.S.C. § 1650a(a).\n\nDespite this congressional mandate, foreign states often attempt to oppose enforcement of ICSID awards by challenging the U.S. court’s subject-matter jurisdiction under the FSIA. But the D.C. Circuit held in Tatneft v. Ukraine that when a foreign state joins a treaty that “contemplate[s] arbitration-enforcement actions in other signatory countries, including the United States”—as the ICSID Convention does—it “waives its immunity from arbitration-enforcement actions” under the FSIA. 771 F. App’x 9, 10 (D.C. Cir. 2019). The Second Circuit has applied this principle in the context of the ICSID Convention, holding that a foreign states “waive[s] its sovereign immunity” from enforcement of an ICSID award “by becoming a party to the ICSID Convention.” Blue Ridge Invs., L.L.C. v. Republic of Argentina, 735 F.3d 72, 84 (2d Cir. 2013). These decisions provide an alternative basis—in addition to the arbitration exception at issue in Chiejina—for establishing subject-matter jurisdiction in an action to enforce an ICSID award.\n\nDecision\n\nThe petitioners in ConocoPhillips sought to confirm and enforce an ICSID award issued against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. When Venezuela failed to timely respond to the enforcement petition, the petitioners sought entry of a default judgment, and the district court granted the motion. Although the motion was not opposed, the district court addressed subject-matter jurisdiction under the FSIA, holding that Venezuela was not immune from suit—and the court therefore had subject-matter jurisdiction—on two grounds: (1) the FSIA’s arbitration exception; and (2) the FSIA’s waiver exception, 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(1), which provides jurisdiction where a foreign state has waived its immunity to suit in U.S. court.\n\nFirst, the court concluded that when a foreign state agrees to arbitration pursuant to the ICSID Convention, the arbitration exception permits enforcement even if the state subsequently withdraws from the Convention, so long as “the relevant rights and obligations of the parties arose before [the] denunciation took effect.” This holding means that a foreign state cannot evade its obligations to parties holding ICSID awards by withdrawing from the ICSID Convention.\n\nSecond, the court confirmed that the waiver exception also applied because “Venezuela implicitly waived its sovereign immunity with respect to suits to recognize and enforce ICSID awards by becoming a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention.” The court emphasized that “[t]o hold otherwise would be to disrespect Venezuela’s choice (at the time) to be a Contracting State, and it would diminish other Nations’ ability to attract investment in the future by committing themselves to resolving investment disputes through arbitration.” The court thus referenced one of the key purposes of the ICSID Convention: By providing investors with a remedy through arbitration and strong guarantees that any resulting award will be subject to enforcement, the Convention helps contracting parties attract foreign investment. ConocoPhillips thus strengthens the chorus of decisions recognizing that parties to the ICSID Convention and other arbitration enforcement treaties waive their immunity from enforcement of arbitral awards issued pursuant to those treaties.\n\nD.D.C. Clears The Way For Landmark $6.5 Billion Judgment Enforcing Arbitration Award Against Pakistan\n\nOn March 10, 2022, a district court in the D.C. Circuit issued a groundbreaking decision on behalf of Tethyan Copper Company PTY Limited (“Tethyan”), an Australian mining company represented by Matt McGill, Robert Weigel, Jason Myatt, and Matt Rozen of Gibson Dunn in its long-running efforts to enforce a $4 billion plus interest arbitration award issued against Pakistan pursuant to the ICSID Convention. Tethyan Copper Co. PTY Ltd. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan, No. 1:19-cv-2424, 2022 WL 715215 (D.D.C. Mar. 10, 2022). In its opinion and accompanying order, the court denied Pakistan’s motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, to stay enforcement proceedings, and directed the parties to submit a proposed judgment, clearing the way for the entry, after interest and costs, of a more than $6.5 billion judgment as of this writing, which would be one of the largest judgments ever entered by the D.C. federal district court. The decision reinforces three principles concerning the enforcement of ICSID awards.\n\nFirst, the decision emphatically rejects the recurring argument that enforcement of such awards should universally be stayed while the losing party tries to vacate or set aside the award in parallel proceedings. Under the ICSID Convention, only an ICSID tribunal or committee—not the courts of any contracting state—may decide whether an award should be set aside, either through revision by the original tribunal pursuant to Article 51 of the Convention, or through annulment by an ad hoc committee pursuant to Article 52 of the Convention. Article 54 of the Convention expressly provides that ICSID awards are immediately enforceable as “final judgment[s]” even while revision or annulment proceedings are pending, and it tasks the ICSID tribunal or committee overseeing those proceedings with deciding whether a stay of enforcement is appropriate.\n\nIn TCC, Pakistan sought both revision and annulment, but the tribunal and committee overseeing those proceedings allowed enforcement to proceed. Pakistan then moved in the district court to stay the U.S. enforcement proceedings. But the district court rejected that request. The court acknowledged some prior decisions from the same district that had stayed enforcement proceedings pending set aside proceedings. In the court’s view, however, the interest in judicial economy and the potential hardship to Tethyan from a stay clearly outweighed any potential hardship to Pakistan from denying a stay. Tethyan had waited over a decade for compensation, and the court concluded that “[a] stay only prolongs justice denied.”\n\nSecond, the court rejected the state’s attempt to relitigate in enforcement proceedings jurisdictional arguments already raised before and rejected by the arbitral tribunal. Specifically, Pakistan had challenged the tribunal’s jurisdiction on the ground that there was no valid arbitration agreement, because Pakistan purportedly had not properly consented to arbitration under the ICSID Convention. The tribunal rejected the argument. In the subsequent enforcement proceedings, Pakistan attempted to renew the same objection—that there was no valid arbitration agreement between the parties—as a challenge both to the district court’s jurisdiction under the FSIA and its authority to grant full faith and credit to the award. Relying on the above-described principles from the D.C. Circuit’s decisions in Stileks and Chevron, however, the TCC court refused to second-guess the tribunal’s rulings on arbitrability—including the existence of a valid agreement to arbitrate. The court held that once such issues have been resolved in arbitration, they cannot be revisited through a collateral attack on the tribunal’s rulings, whether in the guise of a challenge to jurisdiction under the FSIA or to the merits of the enforcement petition.\n\nFinally, the court’s order, directing the parties to promptly meet and confer and submit a proposed judgment, with interest, recognizes that once the court has determined that it has subject-matter jurisdiction to enforce an ICSID award, the award holder is entitled to prompt entry of judgment as soon as interest is calculated. (In an effort to facilitate settlement, the court later granted the parties’ joint request for an extension of time to submit a proposed judgment until December 15, 2022.) If followed elsewhere, the court’s order may greatly streamline efforts by future litigants to enforce arbitral awards against foreign sovereigns in U.S. courts.\n\nGibson Dunn’s Judgment and Arbitral Award Enforcement Practice Group offers top-tier international arbitral award and judgment enforcement strategies and solutions, deep proficiency in cross-border litigation and international arbitration, and best-in-class advocacy that not only applies the law, but, time and again, has crafted and shaped new law to achieve our clients’ objectives.\n\nGibson Dunn’s lawyers are available to assist in addressing any questions you may have regarding developments at the D.C.
