    "Hungary Should Guarantee Safety of Lesbian Activists During DykeMarch": "Click to expand Image Rising anger over policies of Hungary's right-wing government filled the streets of the country's capital as thousands of LGBT activists and supporters marched in the city's Pride parade in Budapest, Hungary, July 2021. © 2021 Anna Szilagyi/AP Images\n\nHungarian lesbian activists are set to hold their second DykeMarch on October 1, the final day of the EuroCentralAsian Lesbian* Community (EL*C) Conference in Budapest. This year’s conference, “Lesbian Resistance,” will open two weeks after Serbia initially banned EuroPride 2022, the latest in a two-year spate of attacks on Pride marches and other queer events in Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Serbia, Turkey, and Ukraine.\n\nThe EL*C conference and DykeMarch come amid ongoing government harassment of lesbian activism in Hungary. In February, an appeals court ruled against Labrisz Lesbian Association, finding that an article in a pro-government newspaper likening lesbian activists to pedophiles did not injure their reputation. This reversed a lower court decision, which deemed the article to be unfounded and offensive.\n\nIn June 2021, a Hungarian law criminalized showing “any content portraying or promoting sex reassignment or homosexuality” to children, falsely conflating LGBT rights with pedophilia. In August 2021, a government decree restricted customer access to the children’s book “A Fairytale for Everyone”, published by Labrisz Lesbian Association in 2020, under a new requirement that children's books seen to “promote homosexuality” be sold only in “closed wrapping.” The Labrisz book retells traditional fairytales with queer, feminist characters.\n\n“Having the conference in Budapest means a lot to us,” said Dorottya Redai, an activist with Labrisz. “Labrisz has been fighting against the political oppression of sexual minority women since 1999. Under the current government, we work harder than ever. We hope the Conference will signal to the government that lesbian resistance is powerful and won’t be silenced.”\n\nThe EL*C conference and DykeMarch take an intersectional approach, demanding rights for migrants, refugees, Roma communities, and other minority groups. As such, organizers could be at risk vis-a-vis Hungary’s sweeping criminalization in 2018 of migrant and refugee rights defenders. That law, condemned by several United Nations Special Rapporteurs and held by the Court of Justice of the European Union to violate EU law, remains in effect.\n\nGiven these wide-ranging attacks on queer, feminist, migrant, and minority rights advocacy, Hungarian authorities should ensure that the rights to freedom of assembly, association, and expression are protected during the EL*C conference and DykeMarch, and repeal laws that criminalize the work of activists and human rights defenders.",

    "Hungary PM Orban says EU sanctions on Russia have \"backfired\"": "BUDAPEST, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Hungary should prepare for a prolonged war in neighbouring Ukraine, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Monday, sharply criticising European Union sanctions imposed on Russia which he said have \"backfired\", driving up energy prices.\n\nOrban, long at odds with the EU over some of his policies seen in Brussels as anti-democratic, urged a ceasefire to end the war and said the sanctions against Russia were dealing a blow to Europe's economy.\n\nOrban, who was reelected for a fourth consecutive term in April, now faces surging inflation, plunging consumer confidence and the prospect of a recession next year.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nHe told parliament it was no surprise that governments were falling in Europe, referring to the Italian election on Sunday following which Giorgia Meloni looks set to lead Italy's most right-wing government since World War Two.\n\n\"We can safely say that as a result of the sanctions, European people have become poorer, while Russia has not fallen to its knees,\" Orban said. \"This weapon has backfired, with the sanctions Europe has shot itself in the foot.\"\n\n\"We are waiting for an answer, the entire Europe is waiting for an answer from Brussels on how long we will keep doing this,\" he said, adding it was also time to discuss the sanctions with the United States.\n\nOrban, whose government is in talks with the European Commission to secure billions of euros in EU funds blocked over rule-of-law concerns, said his government would launch a \"national consultation\" asking Hungarians about sanctions.

    "Judy Asks: Is the EU Too Soft on Hungary?": "Caroline de Gruyter European affairs correspondent for NRC Handelsblad\n\nThe question is not whether the union is too soft. The question is what it is to do in order to protect our legal order, in Hungary and elsewhere.\n\nWe tend to treat Hungary and Poland as one. Nothing is more wrong. The current Poland is ideological and is desperate to show, clumsily, that it is a big country. Hungary knows it is small and relishes the underdog posture. The founding myth of Hungary is that of the little chaps poking their big master. This was true under the Habsburgs, during Soviet times, and now with the EU. It is a Hungarian source of pride.\n\nWhat is the EU to do, then? Firstly, as former French president François Mitterrand used to say: “give time to time.” Let time do its work. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán is more transactional than ideological: he tests boundaries in Brussels, then often retreats. He needs Brussels ultimately more than the internal posture. And no leader is for ever.\n\nAnd secondly, the European Commission needs to be strong on the legal fundamentals, not only in relation to Hungary but also in relation to other member states. The primacy of European law is routinely questioned, even in countries like France and Germany. This is lethal to the European legal order, more than anything Orbán could ever do. That is the crucial fight.\n\nDaniel Hegedus Transatlantic fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States\n\nThe European Commission went through a significant learning process in 2021–22 and has shown remarkable changes in its approach to the authoritarian developments in Hungary and Poland.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2021, the Commission clearly subordinated the protection of EU values like democracy and rule of law to short-sighted institutional and party-political interests, like consensus-building in the European Council or keeping Hungary’s ruling party Fidesz in the European People’s Party.\n\nThe European Commission hasn’t only been too soft on Hungary; it failed to realize the strategic challenge posed by autocratizing member states to the internal integrity and external perception of the EU. It fulfilled its role as “guardian of the treaties” with gross negligence.\n\nSince 2021, one can see clear attempts to exploit available political tools, like the conditionality regulation or the suspension of the European Recovery and Resilience Facility assets to put leverage on Europe’s illiberal twins and change their cost-benefit calculations regarding autocratization. This change in the Commission’s behavior was mainly triggered by political pressure from the European Parliament and “friend of the rule of law” member states like the Netherlands.\n\nHowever, exactly due to the central role of external incentives in this behavioral change, there is no guarantee that in the future the Commission will continue playing hardball with Hungary and Poland and refrain from foul compromises. The protection of European values needs continuous commitment from all stakeholders across Europe to keep its current direction.\n\nShada Islam Founder and Managing Director of the New Horizons Project\n\nThe EU’s “let’s not rock the boat” strategy toward Hungary’s Viktor Orbán is short-sighted, self-defeating, and shameful. It erodes the EU’s reputation and standing, both at home and abroad.\n\nIn the eyes of many European citizens—especially Europeans of color—the EU approach makes a mockery of the bloc’s commitment to democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. Foreign observers, meanwhile, see it as yet another demonstration of EU double standards in chiding the Global South for not respecting democratic norms while allowing one of its own member states to flout them, repeatedly.\n\nInterestingly also, while some half-hearted attempts are being made to call out the Hungarian government on key issues of independence of the judiciary and media and violations of rule of law, over the years, EU policymakers have turned a deaf ear to Orbán’s racist rants and white supremist diatribes.\n\nThere was a lukewarm reaction to the Hungarian leader’s angry denunciation of “mixed race” societies last July but it took the European Parliament and European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen about a week to gather the courage to remind Orbán—who was not mentioned directly—that such “hostile rhetoric” and “inexcusable statements” were in breach of EU treaties.\n\nSuch complacency must end if the EU is to be taken seriously as a geopolitical actor: the union can’t accommodate racism at home while urging foreign governments to stop discrimination and marginalization of minorities abroad.\n\nAlica Kizeková Head of the Asia Pacific Unit at the Centre for the Study of Global Regions, International Relations Institute Prague\n\nThe EU’s response to Hungary’s democratic backsliding has been slow and ineffective. Hungary is the only EU member that is not “free” but “partly free” according to the assessment of Freedom House, and this has been the trend for the past few years. If this trend continues and Viktor Orbán further strengthens his power, restricts the public debate, and does not provide fair conditions for the opposition to participate, then the EU could face a true embarrassment in 2024, when Hungary is bound to take on the presidency of the Council of the European Union.\n\nThe EU treaties clearly declare that decisions should be taken by twenty-seven democratic countries and if a member state that presides the union is not a full democracy, that puts the EU in a difficult position, and the union loses its credibility. It could also further encourage anti-democratic movements across Europe.\n\nIt is vital for the EU to prepare a set of clear recommendations and ensure that Hungary demonstrates tangible improvements to access the funds related to the post-COVID-19 recovery. Additionally, there should be more consultation on how to navigate the resource dependencies on Russia. For some EU member states, such as Hungary, it is not easy to cut ties completely due to the high reliance on energy resources. But it is important that they voice their positions in a manner that does not undermine the EU’s energy diversification efforts or weaken the union’s positions.\n\nPéter Krekó Director of the Political Capital Institute, Budapest\n\nSo far, the response to this question has been an obvious “yes.” Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has been able to build an illiberal hybrid regime—or, I would even say, an “informational autocracy”—with the financial support of the EU. This regime is doing its best to undermine the union’s decision-making capabilities.\n\nThe actual response to this question will be ready when we will see the EU’s decisions on two crucially important issues. The first is the freezing of about 20 percent of Hungary’s next seven-year-long budget and the second is the further (or even permanent) withholding of the Resilience and Recovery Funds.\n\nThe government seems to be ready to make concessions, promising to implement many systemic changes—for example, setting up an anti-corruption agency. Yet many in the Commission still seem to be naive enough to believe that such changes will matter. They won’t.\n\nIf there is no rule of law, more laws passed will not change the modus operandi of the regime. Systemic corruption is the engine of the Orbán regime. The engine won’t be switched off at Brussels’ request. The big question is if the hawks in the Commission, the European Parliament, and some member states in the European Council will put pressure on the members of the Commission who think a soft compromise is inevitable.\n\nWhile the Commission has largely stood by and watched as Orbán built his informational autocracy, the European Parliament—the EU’s only directly elected body—has been much tougher on Hungary. Had its stance been adopted earlier, Hungary’s democracy might be in much better shape.\n\nJacek Kucharczyk President of the Executive Board at the Institute of Public Affairs, Warsaw\n\nDemocratic backsliders in Budapest and in Warsaw have been playing a long game with Brussels. They want to ensure it continues to provide them with the funds necessary for them to consolidate their authoritarian power and ensure social peace through financial transfers to crucial constituencies, such as rural inhabitants or pensioners.\n\nVictor Orbán has played this game for much longer than Poland’s Law and Justice (PiS) de facto leader Jaroslav Kaczyński. His success has encouraged Polish authoritarian populists - acknowledged by the PiS slogan “Budapest in Warsaw”. Had Brussels been tougher with Orbán early on, his Polish counterparts in the PiS would have found it more difficult to convince the voters that they can flout European values and continue to benefit from the EU largesse. Orbán showed them that they can have a cake and eat it too.\n\n\n\nThe introduction of the rule of law mechanism has given the EU a new powerful tool of enforcing the compliance with European values. At the same time, Hungary’s pro-Putin stand after the Russian invasion of Ukraine has made it obvious to the EU political class that Orbán is not just a threat to Hungarian democracy but to the EU’s ability to respond to this war in accordance with Europe’s core values. Orbán’s latest offer of a phony compromise should not give Brussels an excuse to abandon its principled position and to release the funds he needs for his political survival.\n\nPol Morillas Director of the Barcelona Centre for International Affairs (CIDOB)\n\nAs a community of values, the EU should not compromise its most fundamental ones. Democracy, rule of law, and individual rights, particularly those of minorities, have all been questioned by Viktor Orbán’s ideology and government practices.\n\nTrue, many member states have internal flaws that prevent them from fully complying with these values. But no other compares to the way Orbán challenges the EU’s fundamental principles in the name of his particular “culture war.” Let’s be clear: Orbán’s attack on a “mixed-race” Hungary is not a form of acceptable “family-friendly” conservatism, but an outspoken and contemporary version of the politics of stigmatization.\n\nOn Ukraine, Orbán builds his current position on a longstanding attempt to cultivate links with Russia and China at the expense of the EU’s interests and common positions. He would like to be seen as a useful, impartial mediator when the time of negotiations arrive, but the rest of the EU is well aware that Orbán has promoted disrespect for the EU and its institutions, so no loyalty on his part can be expected. Hence the distance of traditional friends, such as Poland, from Orbán’s Russia policy.\n\nThe anti-Brussels alignment between Warsaw and Budapest is being tested against more material and tangible issues: security in Europe, energy dependence, and access to EU funds. The union has shown remarkable resilience as a political project when subsequently confronted with the challenges of disintegration, the pandemic, and the war.\n\nZsuzsanna Szelényi Program director at the Central Europe University Democracy Institute\n\nWe do not know yet. Viktor Orbán’s government has been intensively negotiating with the European Commission and announced concessions to strike a deal and unlock €7 billion ($7 billion) that have been frozen due to concerns about state capture and corruption. This fund is the cornerstone of maintaining Viktor Orbán’s power, and is needed more than ever before: the Hungarian currency has hit a low and inflation keeps rising.\n\nThe government promises consensus on all the Commission’s recommendations, above all on an independent anti-corruption authority. But Hungarians remain skeptical. For twelve years Orbán’s circles have managed to capture all state institutions and it would be a miracle to have a new body of checks and balances now. Instead of new legal trickeries, joining the European Public Prosecution Office would be somewhat promising, at least on the corruption front.\n\nThe Commission seems to be more determined than ever to push Orbán’s government to comply with the basic interests of the EU. But will it be persistent enough? The maintenance of the Russia sanctions policy and creating a joint European energy policy are decisive for the success of the von der Leyen Commission and also for Europe’s future.\n\nWill the Commission finally have the patience to force Orbán’s government to follow rule-based politics or will it cut negotiations short, again, with too much give?\n\nIvan Vejvoda Head of Europe’s Futures Project at the Institute for Human Sciences, Vienna\n\nThe EU has been all too slow at recognizing that there has been and continues to be a very serious issue with the erosion of democracy in a certain number of its member states. Heralded as the frontrunner in the transition to democracy Hungary for more than a decade, as an EU member state, has been curtailing rights and freedoms and the rule of law.\n\nComplacency and the “do not rock the boat” attitude of EU institutions and other member states have led to fruitlessly hoping that things would in time change. In Hungary Orbán’s grip on power, institutions and control of media had in September 2018 triggered the Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union. The EU is now blocking until further notice disbursement of the recovery funds.\n\nThe European People’s Party shoulders much of the responsibility for the slow and soft response to Hungary’s democratic backsliding. Suspended from the group in the Spring of 2019, Hungary’s ruling party Fidesz decided to leave the group before being expelled in March 2021.\n\nHungary undermines cores values the EU stands for. Importantly, what goes on in Hungary sets a nefarious example to aspiring EU candidate countries in the Western Balkans.\n\nIn light of the Russian war of aggression against independent and sovereign Ukraine and the latter’s struggle for freedom and rights, more needs to be done by EU member states and institutions to defend democracy and rights in Hungary and elsewhere.",

    "Hungarian government offering partnership to municipalities": "The government offers a partnership to municipalities and “will talk to everybody to ensure that fundamental public services are continued” in the next year, the head of the Prime Minister’s Office said on Monday.\n\nGergely Gulyás told a press conference after the general assembly of the federation of cities with county rights (MJVSZ) that the government expected its partners to economise “in return” with their resources.\n\nGulyás said Hungary’s 25 largest cities would face an extra burden totalling at 135 billion forints (EUR 131.7m) in increased energy costs next year. “This is in fact a result of major European disputes about the war and especially about the energy sanctions launched in response to the war,” he said.\n\nThe government and local authorities will have to rely on each other in this situation, Gulyas said, and asked local councils to reduce their “extra costs” but maintain “essential public services”. They would still need government assistance, he added, and said the government would talk to the municipalities and help out.\n\n“There is only one solution on the long run: energy sanctions should be replaced by a policy aimed at stabilising energy prices in Europe,” Gulyás said.\n\nGulyás called for “sensible” European policies, which “do not favour Russia, the aggressor, through soaring gas prices, but which hurt the aggressor and cause no harm to Europe”, and added that “so far the energy sanctions have proven otherwise.”\n\nRead also Hungarian local governments in big trouble, Budapest may also have a freeze break\n\nGulyás noted that national energy company MVM had recently offered municipalities various deals in which they could pay “different prices” for their energy with no obligation to pay several months in advance, but added that “issues around prices have not yet been fully settled”.\n\nKároly Szita, the head of the federation, said municipalities should work to “use the least possible amount of energy next year, but in any case less energy than in 2022”. He said fundamental services should remain, but some municipal institutions could stay closed for the winter months. He suggested talks between the government and ailing municipalities to start in the second half of October or November.",
    "The E.U. Is Finally Standing Up to Viktor Orbán": "For more than a decade, Hungary’s prime minister Viktor Orbán has been locked in battle with the European Union over the democratic rules that Brussels expects E.U. member states to uphold. His commitment to “illiberal” Christian democracy has long since become a flashpoint. An E.U. report released earlier this month accuses Orbán of transforming Hungary into an “electoral autocracy” in which the prime minister has made “deliberate and systematic efforts” to undermine E.U. values.\n\nOrbán, a talented populist who has built his public popularity by picking fights with Eurocrats, insists he is merely defending Hungarian traditional values. But he stands accused in the report of attacks on press freedom, the independence of judges and courts, academic freedom, minority rights, and the rights of asylum seekers. None of this is new, but the report dropped at a highly charged moment.\n\nOn September 15, the European Parliament voted by an overwhelmingly majority to approve that report, which not only criticized Hungary for undermining democracy and the rule of law but also the European Commission for failing to force Hungary to change course. Orbán dismissed the report and the vote as a “bad joke.”\n\nFor years, the E.U. has had few good options to force Orbán and his Fidesz party to respect the rules, because so many of its potential punishment measures against offending member-state governments require unanimous support from other EU members, allowing Orbán to rely on support from fellow populists in Poland who can use vetoes to provide him with cover. But Brussels can hold back badly needed cash from the EU budget if it can prove there is credible risk the funds will be stolen by corrupt officials within the country in question.\n\nOn September 18, the E.U. fired this shot for the first time in its history.\n\nThe European Commission formally recommended that EUR 7.5 billion in funding for Hungary be held back until its government addresses a long list of specific issues. This isn’t the only money at risk. Unsuccessful E.U. bargaining with Hungary over terms of disbursement of EUR 14.9 billion in grants and loans as part of a COVID Recovery Fund leave Budapest short of money equaling about 8.5% of the country’s GDP. That’s a big hit for a small country.\n\nOther member states will vote in November on whether to withhold these funds, and the outcome won’t require unanimity but simply a “qualified majority,” a much lower threshold that leaves Orbán without protection. If the vote is yes, as is widely expected, Budapest will have one month to respond with changes meant to meet E.U. demands.\n\nOrbán is holding a weak hand. His government is already contending with high prices, a wobbly currency, and an energy crisis. Headline inflation rose to 15.6% in August, its highest point in 24 years. Prices for staple foods like milk, bread, and poultry have surged between 40% and 65% over the past year. After an election-year spending spree to support Orbán’s most recent victory, Hungary’s budget deficit is already far worse than his government forecast. Despite that, the government has buckled to public pressure by taking on an even heavier burden. In particular, it will extend price caps on some foods and fuels until the end of the year.\n\nRead More: The E.U. Is United Against Russia, With One Exception\n\nAdding to the pressure on Hungary’s economy, fears raised by E.U. action have weighed heavily on the forint, Hungary’s currency. It’s down 16% against the EUR over the past 12 months and 37% against the US dollar. Hungary’s current account deficit more than doubled from July to August of this year.\n\nIn short, the writing on the wall is so clear that even Viktor Orbán can read it. He and his party are still plenty popular at home. He can get by a while longer by blaming the E.U. and the war in Ukraine for Hungary’s economic problems.\n\nBut a rough winter looms, as Hungary, one of the countries most deeply dependent on energy supplies from Russia, scrambles for help. Failure to get prices under control could well start to cut into his support. Hungary needs that money, and it will have to jump through dozens of hoops to get it. Orbán’s government has already moved to begin meeting E.U. demands. On September 19, it sent parliament an anti-corruption bill. More such moves are in the works or will be soon.\n\nMore broadly, this is the opening salvo in a bid by E.U. officials to become much tougher with the governments of member states that flout Union rules on core values like rule of law. Brussels doesn’t want this fight to escalate, but it knows that other members are watching to see if these newly tough measures have teeth. Orbán will try to do as little as possible to unlock the funds his government needs. The E.U. doesn’t want a crisis that inflicts pain on Hungary’s people, but its leaders know they need to send a message that will be received across Europe.\n\nThe two sides will probably reach a deal, though it will surely take time. There will be many devils in many details that must be managed. The E.U. escalation is just the opening salvo of a much longer bureaucratic battle ahead.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com.",
    "Hungary Wants to Host Italian Super Cup": "Italian newspaper La Repubblica reported over the weekend that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has offered 8 million euros to the Italian Football Federation if Hungary hosts the next Italian Super Cup (Supercoppa Italiana), according to Index, a Hungarian news site, which contacted the Prime Minister’s Office in this regard.\n\nAccording to the Italian newspaper, a few weeks ago, the Hungarian Prime Minister proposed the idea of Budapest hosting the Italian Super Cup, and the Italian Football Federation is reportedly considering the offer.\n\nThe out-of-town venue would not be new, with Saudi Arabia hosting the 2018 and 2019 Super Cups, and the country is also planning to host the upcoming match on January 18, 2023. However, according to La Repubblica, this could easily change and the federation could decide to host the match in Hungary instead.\n\nRelated article 0:1 - Hungarian Team Beats Dull Germany in Leipzig Ádám Szalai's goal keeps Hungary in top position in the group of deathContinue reading\n\nEven though the original article mentioned Budapest as a possible venue, several media outlets reported that the Hungarian Prime Minister offered to host the match at the Pancho Aréna in Felcsút, close to his home. However, this might be an error, since the Pancho Aréna can only accommodate 3,500 people. The Hungarian offer probably stands for the Puskas Aréna in Budapest which can host more than 67,000 fans.\n\nBudapest would be a good alternative, if only because Hungary is significantly closer to Italy than Saudi Arabia.\n\nSo the fact that teams and fans would have to travel less to the Hungarian capital is not a negligible factor. The Italian Super Cup will be played between Inter Milan and AC Milan, and according to media reports, both teams would prefer Hungary as the venue.\n\nLa Repubblica reports that the decision about the football match could be heavily influenced by the result of the Italian elections on Sunday.\n\nThe Italian coalition of right-wing parties won the election by a large margin, as a result of which Giorgia Meloni, the leader of the Brothers of Italy (FdI) party and an ally of Viktor Orban, is likely to become the next Italian prime minister.\n\nMeanwhile, Hungary and Italy will play against each other today in Puskás Aréna in the Nations League. The teams are in competition for first place within their group, which is now led by Hungary after defeating Germany on Friday.\n\nFeatured photo via MTI/Illyés Tibor",

    "New German chain has entered Hungary, threatening competition": "The new German chain TEDi has recently opened its fourth store in Hungary. The product categories sold in the stores are similar to those of Pepco and KiK, which means that competition might be in trouble now.\n\nTEDi offers everything from cosmetics, home furnishings, decorations and toys to office supplies and pet food. The chain might be new and Pepco and KiK might be already very well-established stores in Hungary, TEDi has a rather bright future in Hungary. Pénzcentrum has taken a look at where the competition among the industrial goods chains stands.\n\nHow many stores does each chain have in Hungary?\n\nTEDi has four stores in Hungary: in Budapest at the Savoya Park and in the XVIII. district, as well as in Székesfehérvár and Pápa. In contrast, Pepco has 223 stores in the country, and Kik has more than 100 stores, according to their website. But TEDi could soon start a rapid expansion within Europe, not excluding Hungary.\n\nWhat kind of shops are they?\n\nAccording to Pénzcentrum, it is difficult to define the exact profile of these three chains. That is because they offer practically all kinds of goods that are needed in everyday life. TEDi’s motto, for example, “Everything decoration, party, stationery and much more” does not tell us too much. The range of goods on offer is reminiscent of the once common “hundred-forint” shops, a concept that existed abroad in the same way, as one-euro, one-dollar shops.\n\nWhat will be the future of these chains in Hungary?\n\nAlthough KiK has been present in our country since 2008, Pepco, which has been expanding since 2015, has many more stores.\n\nPepco Hungary Kft., the operator of the Pepco store network, generated net sales of HUF 68.5 billion from domestic sales in its last known financial year, from 1 October 2020 to 30 September 2021.

    "Good news: Indian summer will arrive in Hungary soon!": "It might happen that, in some weeks, you will feel better outside than inside in Hungary. That is because Hungarian public institutions will only be heated to 18 °C, while on the streets there will be 25 °C and sunshine. Indian summer will arrive in Hungary soon. Below you may read the details.\n\nThe end of this September is much colder than average, and there are a lot of rains everywhere in Hungary. That is good news because of the drought that hit Hungary hard during the summer but depletes our bank account. The heating season started in many places in Hungary because of the extra low temperatures, so people have to pay their increased energy bills earlier than people previously thought. Indian summer may ease that burden for a while soon, rtl.hu reported.\n\nIn Hungary, summer is hot and dry while autumn is windy and rainy but not extreme cold. However, hot weather can return even in October. The characteristic of such days is that, despite morning fogs and rains, late morning and afternoons are nice and warm, perfect for a jogging program or a trip. Therefore, it is not unusual to see people going to work, and school in jackets and returning home wearing only a T-shirt.\n\nRead alsoHungarian international airport to close in October\n\nThat is because on windless days, the sun waves reaching our body can raise even 10 °C on our general feeling of heat.\n\nThis year the Indian summer will not be long, rtl.hu says. Furthermore, we must wait for it for a while. Until Sunday late afternoon, the weather will be dry and cold. Afterwards, rains will start everywhere in Hungary. The temperature will rise next week, but rains will also remain.\n\nMiddle-term forecasts show that the weather will turn dry again next weekend, while the temperature will continue to rise. Though uncertainties are significant in longer-term prognoses, rtl.hu believes that hot weather may arrive in early October for a couple of days. That would mean 20-25 °C daily maximums and a lot of sunshine.\n\nRead alsoBudapest’s traffic to be paralyzed Monday evening – details here\n\nUnsure, longer-term forecasts say that there will not be tremendous rain in Hungary in October, the weather will be dry but not too warm.\n\nIn Hungary, we use the term “vénasszonyok nyara” for the Indian summer. That is because in the villages, older women could not sit in front of their houses during the summer heat, only in early autumn, when the weather was still hot but not scorching. Therefore, fall became their summer when they could talk, gossip and enjoy the sunshine.\n\nSource: rtl.hu",
    "Hungary Will Continue Issuing Visas to Russians, Foreign Minister Says": "Peter Szijjarto, the Hungarian Foreign Minister, has confirmed that his government will continue issuing Schengen visas to Russian nationals, despite the ongoing sanctions imposed on the latter and talks for an eight package of restrictions being on the way.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n“It’s a somewhat more complex and slow procedure compared to when there is such a treaty. But even when there’s no agreement, it doesn’t mean we don’t issue visas. Of course, we will continue doing so, in accordance with the procedure,” Szijjarto said in New York, attending the UN General Assembly.\n\nThe EU agreed on July 31 to discontinue the agreement with Russia, which simplified visa issuance to Russian citizens, SchengenVisaInfo.com reports.\n\nPoland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania later introduced restrictive measures to Russian tourists, including visa issuance, later also joined by Finland. On the other hand, Germany and France opposed a blanket ban on Russian tourists entering the zone.\n\nSpeaking regarding these measures, the Minister said that those sanctions imposed on Russia haven’t proved to be any successful, and they are, in fact, harming Europe, citing the sanctions as the reason why inflation has increased, utility bills, gas and food prices are soaring, putting the continent’s economy into recession.\n\nSzijjarto said for Kossuth Rádió, a Russian media, that an agreement reached with EU leaders in the most recent meeting for an eighth package had failed as no proposal was made, let alone a final decision.\n\n“We will not approve any decision that harms Hungary’s national interests. The security of our energy supply remains a red line. Any sanction that puts our energy supply at risk is unacceptable for us,” he said.\n\nHe also noted his disappointment for his “Western colleagues” that don’t want to negotiate, while Szijjarto values dialogue and negotiations. According to him, if the EU closes diplomatic channels, there could be no end to the war in Ukraine.\n\nRussia’s Gazprom is delivering 5.8 million cubic metres of gas to Hungary on a daily basis, in addition to volumes regulated in the country’s long-term contract. Hungary’s reserves now contain enough gas to cover 41 per cent of annual consumption, considerably more than the 23 per cent that Europe currently covers as a whole, as Szijjarto said.\n\nThese declarations follow the proposal of the European Commissioner for Budget, Johannes Hahn, to cut funding to Hungary, as the country is failing to align its politics with those from the EU. More specifically, €7.5 billion designated to Hungary will be cut off, as the country is also lacking in respecting democracy, in addition to refusing to impose sanctions on Russia.",

    "Hungary tightens abortion access with listen to ‘foetal heartbeat’ rule": "Hungarian women seeking an abortion will be obliged to “listen to the foetal heartbeat” before they can access the procedure, according to a new decree issued by the government of the far-right prime minister, Viktor Orbán.\n\nThe new regulation is due to come into force on Thursday.\n\n“Nearly two-thirds of Hungarians associate the beginning of a child’s life with the first heartbeat,” the interior ministry said on Monday.\n\nSince Orbán came to power in 2010, his government has pushed “traditional family values” and introduced a series of measures aimed at boosting the country’s falling birthrate. However, it had not previously attempted to amend Hungary’s relatively liberal abortion laws.\n\nSimilar legislation has been introduced in many southern US states, such as Texas and Kentucky, requiring women to hear the “foetal heartbeat” before accessing abortion as part of “informed consent”, even though doctors say use of the term “foetal heartbeat” is medically inaccurate.\n\nThere have been no changes to Hungary’s abortion laws since 1992. According to current legislation, terminations can be carried out in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy on medical or social grounds. In cases where the foetus is not viable, it can be performed at any point in the pregnancy.\n\nHowever, a woman seeking an abortion needs a letter from a gynaecologist confirming the pregnancy, and has to visit family services twice, at least three days apart, where she is given counselling on adoption and state benefits for mothers. Only then can she access a referral for an abortion at a hospital.\n\nThe new legislation is an extension of the government’s anti-abortion policies, aimed at boosting the birthrate, said Noá Nógradí from Patent, a Hungarian women’s rights organisation.\n\n“In Hungary, abortion is widely accepted in society. Statistically, two-thirds of Hungarians would not like to see further abortion restrictions,” she said. “So the government cannot outlaw the procedure overnight. But taking a series of small steps towards restriction can pass more easily.”\n\nNógrádi added that legal abortions had become increasingly difficult as the compulsory counselling sessions were becoming more aggressive and difficult to schedule.\n\n“You can readily observe in the government’s communication that it has become more hardline in terms of assigning women the role of birth-givers and care providers,” she said\n\nMost medical experts regard the term “foetal heartbeat” as misleading when referring to the early weeks of pregnancy. The sound heard during early-term ultrasounds is generated by the ultrasound machine.",
    "Hungary’s clean energy transition is the key to reach energy independence": "Hungary’s transition to clean energy can enable it to achieve greater energy security and independence as it navigates the supply challenges that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has created for countries across Europe, according to a new in-depth policy review by the International Energy Agency.\n\nHungary has a strong starting point for its energy transition thanks to rapid growth of solar PV and a solid base of nuclear power. But it still has considerable work ahead to achieve its objectives for emissions reductions and energy sovereignty.\n\nSince the IEA’s last in-depth energy policy review in 2017, Hungary has increased its climate ambitions. In 2020, it became one of the first countries in Central Europe to put a carbon neutrality goal for 2050 into law and presented a long-term National Clean Development Strategy the following year. Hungary is aiming for 90% of its electricity generation to come from low-carbon sources by 2030.\n\nHowever, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has created a new set of energy security challenges in Europe. In response to the current global energy crisis, Hungary declared a state of energy emergency in July 2022 that allowed the government to increase domestic gas and coal production, secure additional gas imports from Russia and increase the output of the Mátra coal power plant. The government is also considering extending the lifetime of the four reactors at the country’s Paks nuclear power plant, which guarantees almost 50% of Hungary’s electricity supply.\n\n“Prioritising energy efficiency and renewables is a pragmatic approach that aligns with Hungary’s energy and climate goals in the short term and the long term. It can avoid increases in both fossil fuel imports and emissions,” said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol as the IEA released the report today.\n\nAttila Steiner, Hungary's State Secretary for Energy and Climate Policy, said: “Hungary has a strong commitment to renewables. As the next step, the government's priority is to upgrade the national grid to be capable of integrating the rapidly growing electric capacity generated by weather-dependent energy sources. However, to guarantee supply security and reach our ambitions climate goals, it is imperative to maintain or even increase our reliable and emission-free nuclear capacity as well.”\n\nAs a landlocked country, Hungary is today heavily reliant on Russia for natural gas, oil and nuclear fuel imports and new nuclear investment. The IEA review calls on Hungary to reduce fossil fuel consumption and diversify its energy sources towards a broader portfolio of renewables by drawing on the considerable potential of its wind and geothermal energy resources as well as extending the lifetime of existing reactors, where safety permits.\n\nAt the same time, Hungary should make the best use possible of its energy market interconnections, which it has significantly increased in recent years, to get energy supplies from diverse routes, sources and suppliers. The IEA report highlights that Hungary has a critical role to play in the major task of improving Central and Eastern European countries’ links to regional gas storage sites and new LNG terminals elsewhere in the European Union.\n\nThe IEA report recommends that the Hungarian government adopt additional targets and policies to lower fossil fuel consumption, increase energy efficiency and promote investment in clean energy technologies, skills and jobs. Paying close attention to ensuring a fair transition, including providing adequate support for people and communities associated with the Mátra coal plant, will be crucial to secure a smooth phase-out of coal.\n\n“A stronger focus on investment in clean energy technologies is critical,” Dr Birol said. “Hungary has a huge opportunity to develop hydrogen for industrial sectors. Continued investment in developing its solar PV, geothermal and wind resources will allow Hungary to reduce its reliance on natural gas and coal in both heating and power generation. Hungary possesses the technologies it needs to advance its transition toward a clean and more secure energy system, which in turn will improve regional energy security.”",

    "Hungary’s ‘pro-Russia’ stance was inevitable": "Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán traveled to Moscow for the funeral of Mikhail Gorbachev. His attendance leaves Europe questioning if Hungary is pro-Russia | Evgenia Novozhenina/AFP via Getty Images\n\nWilliam Nattrass is a freelance journalist and commentator based in Prague.\n\n“Hungary condemns Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.” The words sound unequivocal, but in the context of Hungary’s actions, do they ring true?\n\nAs European allies send weapons to Ukraine and try to minimize their dependence on Russian energy, Hungary has been taking a starkly different path. So far, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has refused to send military aid to Kyiv, and he recently concluded a new gas deal with the Kremlin to help Hungary weather the winter. He’s also more open to continuing normal diplomatic relations with Russia, traveling to Moscow for the funeral of Mikhail Gorbachev, who he said helped Central Europe “rid itself of Communism peacefully, without loss of life or blood.”\n\nWithin Europe, the country stands out like a sore thumb. And with broad support for Orbán’s non-interventionist policy, the question of involvement in the war isn’t even a major wedge issue domestically. So, is it reasonable to claim that Hungary is “pro-Russia”?\n\nThe short answer is no. Hungary’s ambivalent stance is the inevitable result of a combination of domestic political influences, as well as its complex relationships with Russia, Ukraine and the West. In many ways, it is the story of the country’s recent history.\n\nThe main problem with the simple pro-Russia label is that Hungarian attitudes toward Russia and Russians are far from friendly. Perceptions of Russia are still colored by Soviet forces crushing the Hungarian uprising of 1956, just as the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia haunts Czechs and Slovaks to this day. Even Orbán himself was a fervent anti-communist campaigner in the twilight years of the Eastern Bloc.\n\nPro-Russia social currents are also arguably much weaker in Hungary than among its Slavic neighbors. Nationalist movements in Slovakia, Serbia and the Czech Republic often share a sense of ideological kinship with Russia, one linked to suspicion of the West, seeing Ukraine’s pro-Western policy as something akin to a betrayal of Slavic identity.\n\nHowever, such interpretations of the war don’t exert the same sway in Hungary because Hungarians aren’t Slavic — neither do they nurture positive attitudes to Russians in general.\n\nSo how, then, to account for the country’s current pro-Russia stance?\n\nFirst off, it’s important to highlight that Hungarians have strikingly negative attitudes toward Ukraine. While Russia has harmed Hungary at various times in the past, Ukraine is seen as wronging Hungarians in the present.\n\nRelations between Budapest and Kyiv took a dramatically negative turn in recent years, when Ukraine introduced restrictions on national minorities intended to combat Russian influence. Hungarians claim minority communities in Transcarpathia — a region of Ukraine ceded by Hungary after World War I — faced hostility because of these policies.\n\nSince then, Orbán has been accused of fostering resentment. Tensions flared in 2018 over a video that apparently showed diplomats illegally issuing Hungarian passports to people in Transcarpathia. Later, in 2019, Hungary was accused of trying to influence the outcome of elections in the region, and blocked Ukraine’s NATO membership negotiations over the row.\n\nToday, from the Donbas to Kosovo, events are again proving the potency of nationalist narratives over lost territory and peoples separated by the claimed injustices of history. Yet, in the context of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the simple fact that many Hungarians have negative views of both Russians and Ukrainians is pertinent.\n\nAnd while these views have clearly influenced Hungarian government policy on both military aid and sanctions, other historical, economic and cultural factors have played their part as well.\n\nMany Hungarians worry about the gravitational pull that wars can have on neighboring countries. In the early 1990s, Hungary only narrowly escaped being sucked into the wars in the Balkans, after it was revealed that Budapest had been supplying tens of thousands of Kalashnikov rifles to Croat forces.\n\nOrbán’s economic model built around geopolitical ambivalence has influenced the country’s resistance to energy sanctions as well. Orbán describes Hungary as a “transit economy,” which can only thrive by drawing investment and opportunities from both East and West.\n\nIn this context, German-Russian energy cooperation is paradoxically believed to be fundamental to Hungarian national security. Orbán argues that the German-Russian energy axis remains the only way to stop Eastern Europe from becoming “dependent on the Americans” for energy and military protection. Though, his warning against American energy dominance does seem bizarre given that Hungary, Germany and others have had few qualms about relying on Russia.\n\nFinally, the economic arguments against cutting Russia off dovetails with Hungary’s growing cultural rift with the West. The progressive values rejected by Orbán are also mocked by Moscow, and Orbán has portrayed the country as emblematic of traditional mores. “Russians speak an old language. When we listen to them, it’s as if we are hearing the sounds of the past,” he said.\n\nWith Orbán presenting Western progressivism to Hungarians as dangerous, it should come as no surprise that Russia’s more traditional cultural values exert a certain appeal. As Attila Demkó, head of the Center for Geopolitics at Budapest’s Mathias Corvinus Collegium, says: “After 12 years of pressure from the EU and the West,” many Hungarians fall into the trap of feeling that “if the West is ‘bad,’ there must be some ‘truth’ in what Russia is doing.”\n\nAnd as Orbán voters believe they’ve been demonized by their supposed Western allies in recent years, why, they might ask, should they back a sanctions program?\n\nHungary’s stance on the Ukraine war isn’t based on popular pro-Russia social currents. Rather, it is the result of historical and recent political factors, many of which have been shaped by Orbán himself.\n\nSimply put, Hungary isn’t pro-Russia. But even so, President Vladimir Putin’s invasion hasn’t made it pro-Ukraine either.",

    "Hungary breeds unquiet on Ukraine’s western front": "Orbán himself is advocating for a change of course in Ukraine | Attila Kisbenedek/AFP via Getty Images\n\nPress play to listen to this article Voiced by Amazon Polly\n\nBUDAPEST — The Western alliance is pledging to support Ukraine till the bitter end. Hungary is openly calling on Kyiv to give up.\n\nAcross Europe, capitals are funneling Ukraine weapons to fuel a critical counteroffensive. And they’re broadly insisting Ukraine will decide when it is time to start peace negotiations.\n\nNot Hungary.\n\nThough Hungary is a member of both NATO and the European Union, it has declined to join other Western allies in providing Kyiv with military support. Instead, it has banned weapon deliveries from crossing through Hungary into next-door Ukraine.\n\nWhile Budapest has signed off EU sanctions, it first insisted some of them be watered down. And even as fighting raged in eastern Ukraine this summer, Hungarian officials traveled to Moscow to negotiate a deal for extra gas supplies.\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán himself is advocating for a change of course in Ukraine. The West’s focus, he said in a speech in July, “should not be on winning the war, but on negotiating peace and making a good peace offer.”\n\n“The task of the European Union is not to stand alongside either the Russians or the Ukrainians, but to stand between Russia and Ukraine,” he said.\n\nWestern assistance, he has argued, is only prolonging the conflict. “Sanctions and arms deliveries won’t lead to results,” Orbán told local radio in August. “When one rushes to put out a fire, one doesn’t bring along a flamethrower.”\n\nOrbán’s stance on Ukraine — coming as European leaders worry about war fatigue and a winter of spiking energy prices and inflation — has raised concerns in Kyiv and abroad that Hungary could prove to be the West’s weakest link as it seeks to manage the largest military crisis in Europe since World War II.\n\nOfficials acknowledge that Budapest does not always stand alone, with other capitals sometimes sharing at least part of Hungary’s concerns. But as the EU and NATO allies seek new ways to support Ukraine in a longer-term conflict, Budapest’s reluctance will be a persistent thorn in the Western alliance’s side.\n\nOrbán “doesn’t give a damn about Ukraine,” said András Simonyi, a former Hungarian ambassador to NATO and the United States.\n\nHungary’s position on the war “is not just a nuisance — this is a threat,” he said. “I don’t think NATO or the European Union is taking this seriously. And I think it’s a mistake.”\n\nCloser to the Kremlin than Kyiv\n\nSince returning to power in 2010 Orbán has nurtured closer ties with the Kremlin | Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n\nHungary and Ukraine may share a border, but Budapest has long put more emphasis on its relationship with Moscow.\n\n“Hungary’s Ukraine policy has always been to a certain extent subordinated to Hungary’s Russia policy,” said András Rácz, an associate fellow at the German Council on Foreign Relations. He pointed to energy dependency and investments in Russia as driving Budapest’s calculus.\n\nOrbán began his political career as an anti-Soviet liberal. But since returning to power in 2010 he has nurtured closer ties with the Kremlin, holding frequent meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin and striking a controversial deal with a Russian state-owned company to expand an existing nuclear power plant. On August 26, more than six months into Russia’s full-scale assault on Ukraine, Hungary issued a permit for the project to go ahead.\n\nAt the same time, Hungary’s relationship with Ukraine, particularly over the past five years, has been rocky.\n\nBudapest has repeatedly clashed with Kyiv over education and language policies it says are infringing on the rights of over 100,000 Hungarian speakers living in western Ukraine. As a result, prior to Russia’s full-scale invasion, Budapest repeatedly blocked NATO from holding ministerial-level meetings with Ukraine.\n\nMuch of Orbán’s Ukraine strategy — both before and after February 24 — is driven by Hungarian domestic politics.\n\nBlaming Kyiv — and the West — for the war plays into Orbán’s electoral narrative, said political scientist and re:constitution fellow Edit Zgut-Przybylska. “It nicely fits the Euroskeptic populism of Fidesz, claiming that the corrupt imperialist West is endangering stability in Central and Eastern Europe,” she said.\n\nAhead of an election this past April, officials from the ruling Fidesz party claimed — falsely — that Ukraine was trying to meddle in the proceedings. In his victory speech, Orbán even cited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as one of his adversaries.\n\nOrbán also seems to be playing a longer geopolitical game, banking on the rise of like-minded forces on both sides of the Atlantic, according to Simonyi, the former ambassador.\n\nThe prime minister — under fire from Western allies for undermining Hungary’s democratic institutions — often speaks about a relative decline in western power and the need to build relationships in other parts of the world.\n\nThe results of the upcoming congressional midterms in the United States, Orbán said in his radio interview, “could influence U.S. foreign policy — including on the question of war and peace. I’m counting on this happening.”\n\nSimonyi said Orbán is seeking the “best of all worlds” — an American populist, right-wing government that would leave him alone, as well as relationships with Russia and China, which don’t care what happens domestically in Hungary.\n\nWar changes everything — for a time\n\nWith the West rallying behind Zelenskyy, Orbán has had little choice but to fall in line | Nicolas Maeterlinck/BELGA MAG/AFP via Getty Images\n\nFor the moment, however, Russia’s February assault has changed the calculus. With the West rallying behind Zelenskyy, Orbán has had little choice but to fall in line.\n\nWhen EU leaders agreed to grant Ukraine candidate status, opening the door to eventual EU membership, the Hungarian leader did not stand in their way. And while Hungary doesn’t allow weapons to cross into Ukraine, it does permit them to transit to other NATO countries, from where they can continue their journey toward the frontline. Budapest also quietly backed using an EU fund to reimburse countries sending Kyiv military equipment.\n\nHungarian officials say their country is in line with the Western alliance. “There are many myths about the Hungarian position,” said one senior Hungarian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He described Budapest’s stance on sanctions, especially when it comes to energy, as a reflection of the country’s “geographic and economic realities.”\n\n“We were not the only ones having national caveats,” the official said.\n\nBut there are still concerns. “Hungary is performing only the necessary minimum,” said Rácz, of the German Council on Foreign Relations. “I think it’s not breaking the consensus, it’s not breaking the unity,” he said. “It is weakening the unity.”\n\nOfficials fret over an alliance straining\n\nBudapest’s response to the invasion has already further isolated the Hungarian government within Europe | Anatolli Stepanov/AFP via Getty Images\n\nBudapest’s response to the invasion has already further isolated the Hungarian government within Europe and cooled the country’s relationship with its closest ally, Poland.\n\nBut now, over six months into the war, the Western alliance’s unity on Ukraine is also straining. There are fissures between Europe’s Russia hawks — in particular the Baltic states — and some western capitals on issues such as Russian visa bans and how to proceed with future sanctions packages.\n\nThere is also, some officials say, a discrepancy between Washington’s expansive support for Kyiv and Europe’s relatively more modest assistance. And war fatigue fears are infiltrating capitals ahead of a tough winter.\n\nAmid this landscape, Western partners fret that Hungary — as such an outlier — risks undermining the EU’s unity and security policies.\n\n“The Hungarians are practicing their own imperial policy towards countries surrounding them where there is Hungarian minority,” said one Central European official.\n\n“Orbán needs to fund his generous social politics by selling out European security,” the official adding, describing the Hungarian government’s behavior “as a Russian and Chinese Trojan horse.”\n\nHungary, according to the official, will continue resisting some efforts to help Ukraine — but within the limits of how “they were acting until now.”\n\n“They are only thinking of themselves, only acting for themselves,” this person said.\n\nThe Ukrainian government, meanwhile, has moderated its public criticism of Hungary over the past weeks, after vocal criticism from Zelenskyy in the first months of the war.\n\nBut concerns in Kyiv persist.\n\nHungary’s leadership has put its “political internal agenda and agenda of their Russian friends forward as opposed to unity and values — unfortunately,” said Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze, chair of the Ukrainian Parliament’s committee on EU integration.\n\n“There are political forces in different European and NATO countries that actually are also working to undermine the unity,” Klympush-Tsintsadze noted, adding that in Hungary, these forces are in power.\n\nThe Hungarian government’s approach, she said, “worries me — how it will further undermine the common response.”",

    "Hungary's bakers feel the heat as bread prices skyrocket": "The cost of bread is much more expensive now in EU countries than before the start of the Ukraine conflict; both nations are major exporters of grains and fertilizers.

In Hungary, however, the price of bread rose by a whopping 66 percent during the same time period.\n\nBut the global surge in wheat prices is not the only factor driving up the cost of bread in Hungary. Record-high inflation and a weak national currency, the forint, is leaving local bakers with little options but to charge more for their baked goods.\n\nAndras Timar heads one of the largest restaurant consulting firms in Budapest. He says a major factor pushing up costs is not just ingredients - it's the rising cost of energy.

    "Hungary backs down on push to lift EU sanctions on 3 Russian oligarchs — for now": "Hungary has, for now, dropped its demand to lift sanctions imposed by the European Union on three Russian oligarchs — a push that had threatened to derail the process for renewing the penalties, as POLITICO had reported on Tuesday.\n\nThe EU must periodically review and renew its time-limited sanctions against individuals, imposed at the outbreak of Russia’s war in Ukraine, or they will lapse. Ahead of Wednesday's meeting of EU envoys, the Czech presidency of the Council of the EU reached an agreement with the Hungarians to avoid a blockade on the extension process by postponing the discussion on the three names to the next time the list must be reviewed in a couple of months.\n\nThis avoided a clash at Wednesday's meeting, according to three EU diplomats.

    "Hungary requires doctors to present women with fetal vital signs before abortion": "Owen Dyer Montreal\n\nDoctors in Hungary must provide women with “a clearly identifiable indication of fetal vital signs” before carrying out any abortion, according to a decree of the government led by Viktor Orban.\n\nThe rule came into force on 15 September, only three days after the decree was announced. Doctors must sign a document verifying that they complied with the rule for every abortion.\n\nAbortion in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy has been legal in Hungary since 1953, with later abortions permitted if fetal defects are judged probable. The Orban government wrote a new constitution in 2011 guaranteeing that “the life of a fetus will be protected from conception,” but this week’s decree is the first move to affect patients.\n\nDora Duro, a legislator with the far right opposition party Our Homeland, claimed on Facebook that it was her party’s proposal that the government had adopted. The decree broke a “decades old taboo” against “pro-life moves,” she wrote.\n\nSo-called fetal heartbeat laws have been a feature of anti-abortion legislation in the US. Early laws aimed to force the pregnant patient to listen to the ultrasound monitor in the hope that it would discourage them from proceeding with abortion. More stringent recent laws, like the Texas Heartbeat Act of 2021, prohibit physicians from providing abortion if they can detect “cardiac activity” in the fetus or embryo.\n\nHungary’s main doctors’ organisation, the Hungarian Medical Chamber, and the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) criticised the government for proceeding with no public consultation and no input from women or doctors. The new requirement “has no medical purpose and serves only to humiliate women,” said the IPPF.\n\nGynaecologists have pointed out that fetuses at the early stage of pregnancy when most abortions occur do not yet have working hearts, only clumps of cells sending electrical signals. The “heartbeat” sound is generated by the ultrasound monitor to represent these electric pulses. It is not a real sound of heart valves operating as is heard in an adult or child using a stethoscope.\n\nAs Hungary’s prime minister, Orban has employed almost no women in his cabinets, arguing that women are unable to handle the stress of Hungarian politics.\n\nHis nationalist government has stopped almost all immigration to the country, and he drew outrage in July when he said that Hungarians opposed the “mixing of races.” But with one of the world’s lowest fertility rates, at 1.45 children per woman, the approach has led to an ageing population and a declining workforce. A population of nearly 10 million today is on course to hit 8 million by 2050.\n\nOrban sought to wring more hours from the labour force with an unpopular law that allowed employers to compel overtime, dubbed the “slave law” by critics. He also offered tax incentives for fecundity, including a complete exemption from income tax for any woman who has four children.\n\nAfter winning re-election in 2018, Orban promised to “reach a comprehensive agreement with Hungarian women,” making it clear that he expected them to have more babies.\n\nHe said in 2019, “In all of Europe there are fewer and fewer children, and the answer of the West to this is migration. They want as many migrants to enter as they are missing kids, so that the numbers will add up. We Hungarians have a different way of thinking. Instead of just numbers, we want Hungarian children.”\n\nAbortion bans take effect in Indiana and West Virginia Meanwhile, in the US, abortion bans continue to be passed in conservative states following the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v Wade in June. As of 15 September two more states, Indiana and West Virginia, banned all abortions at any stage of pregnancy except in the case of rape, incest, threat to the mother’s life, or “fatal fetal anomaly,” although this last category is not clearly defined. Republican lawmakers in West Virginia, in passing their law, expressed frustration that it included exemptions for rape and incest, and lacked a criminal penalty for doctors. The Indiana law allows doctors to be imprisoned for up to six years if they provide an abortion or fail to file required reports. Thirteen states had “trigger bans” that came into effect when Roe v Wade was struck down. A further 13 are working on legislation and are likely to enact either blanket bans or bans after six weeks’ pregnancy, according to an analysis by the Guttmacher Institute.1 Republican senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina this week proposed a national abortion law that would ban the procedure after 15 weeks, which he described as a compromise solution. But his bill is unlikely to make headway in Congress, where his fellow Republicans are increasingly backing away from taking public anti-abortion stances following the negative public reaction to the Roe v Wade decision.",

    "The most beautiful Hungarian words": "Whether someone likes the Hungarian language or not, they have to acknowledge that there are some fascinating words and phrases. We have collected some of the most beautiful Hungarian words and what they mean.\n\nDezső Kosztolányi and his favourite words\n\nDezső Kosztolányi was a famous Hungarian writer and poet and lived between 1885 and 1936. According to him, the 10 most beautiful Hungarian words are láng [flame], gyöngy [pearl], anya [mother], ősz [Autumn], szűz [virgin], kard [sword], csók [kiss], vér [blood], szív [heart], sír [grave, cry]. In addition, he also pointed out that the list compiled by Paul Valéry sounds good in Hungarian, too, writes hungarianlesson.blog.hu. Paul Valéry’s list was the following: pur, jour, or, lac, pic, seul, onde, feuille, mouille, flûte. The Hungarian equivalents of these words are tiszta [pure, clean], nap [day, sun], arany [gold], tó [lake], hegyfok [promonitory, headland], egyedül [alone], hullám [wave], levél [leaf, letter], csermely [rivulet], fuvola [flute].\n\nWhat do foreigners think?\n\nAccording to femina.hu, in the early 2000s, an international speech contest was held. At this event, volunteers who did not speak the given language selected the most beautiful-sounding words of different languages. The participants proclaimed cipőfűző [shoelace] as the most beautiful Hungarian word. In another competitition, they searched for the funniest Hungarian words, and based on the opinion of tourists, cipőfűző [shoelace] was popular in this category as well. Futhermore, foreigners selected the Hungarian word bocsi [sorry] as one of the funniest words.\n\nIn which language does I love you sound best?\n\nAccording to a story (that may or may not be true), a famous Hungarian poet and linguist tricked people at an international speech contest. As népszava.hu writes, the contest focused on the question “In which language does I love you sound best?” Since it was not easy to compete with the French “je t’aime” or the English “I love you”, Frigyes Karinthy decided to avoid saying “szeretlek”, the Hungarian aquivalent of “I love you”. Instead, he thought fülolaj sounds better and tricked the foreigners by saying this means “I love you”. In reality, fülolaj means ear oil. However, as the company did not understad the word, they voted for the Hungarian word as the most beautiful one.\n\nSource: hungarianlesson.blog.hu, femina.hu, népszava.hu",
    "Russia’s Gazprom Offers Extra Gas Supplies To Hungary, Cutting Off Deliveries To Other Countries": "SOURCE:kremlin.ru\n\nHungary signed a deal with Russia for additional gas supplies in September and October. The agreement will send up to 5.8 million cubic meters of gas a day to Hungary on top of the contract quantity already in force. “Representatives of Gazprom and the Hungarian government have signed an appropriate agreement,” Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto announced on August 31. The minister pointed out that in August Hungary already received 2.6 million cubic meters of additional gas deliveries per day, which will be increased from September 1 to a maximum of 5.8 million cubic meters per day thanks to the agreement with Gazprom. More gas will reach Hungary from Serbia. Under the 15-year deal signed back in September 2021, Gazprom would ship 4.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas to Hungary annually, via two routes: 3.5 billion cubic meters via Serbia and 1 billion cubic meters via Austria. Szijjarto traveled to Moscow last month, seeking 700 million cubic meters of gas on top of an existing long-term supply deal with Russia. Gazprom started to increase gas supplies to Hungary this month, adding to previously agreed deliveries via the Turkstream pipeline. Hungary’s chief diplomat said the country would not vote for any sanctions that will make the transport of natural gas or oil from Russia to Hungary impossible. Since Russia invaded Ukraine, Hungary has obstructed the EU’s sanctions policy, notably for energy policy and military assistance for war-torn Ukraine but not only. On the same day Hungary discussed extra gas supplies with Gazprom, the Hungarian foreign minister spoke out against a possible visa ban on Russians. Hungary was one of the EU states to veto this decision. The European Union has decided not to impose a blanket ban on visas for Russian tourists, but instead to suspend a 2007 visa facilitation deal. In practice, the number of new visa applications will reduce while it will take longer to obtain visas. On August 31, when Russia announced an increase in gas supplies to Hungary, Gazprom halted natural gas supplies to Germany via the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline. Gazprom on August 18 said it would stop the flow of gas via the pipeline to Europe, citing the need to carry out repairs. German says it is impossible due to technical reasons. In recent weeks, the Russian energy major reduced the amount of gas flowing through a major pipeline from Russia to Europe to 20 percent of full capacity. Gazprom had suspended gas flows to French gas company Engie from September 1 due to failure to pay for supplies in full. This little affects France’s gas supplies. Russia now accounts for less than 4 percent of Engie’s gas imports while French gas storage facilities are now up to 90 percent full. By early November, this could be 100 percent. Unlike Germany, France has diversified its gas deliveries, taking some from North Africa and benefitting from liquefied natural gas supplies. Not incidentally, Gazprom’s recent moves have been linked to a drop in gas prices on the Amsterdam stock exchange after Germany was reported to fill its facilities faster than planned. The outage for maintenance on Nord Stream 1 means that no gas will flow to Germany, perhaps longer than until September 3. Gazprom has seen higher profits in recent months––despite the war in Ukraine and Western sanctions. The gas major said it had made a record €41.63 billion in net profit.",

    "Hungary’s Future Depends a Lot on Universities & Their Quality, Hungarian MFA Says": "The Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Hungary, Péter Szijjártó, said that the country’s future depends greatly on the universities and the quality of the work being done there.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAccording to Minister Szijjártó, the connection between higher education and economic processes is very important, SchengenVisaInfo.com reports.\n\nHe also cited the collaboration between Széchenyi István University and German engineering giant Bosch as a good example.\n\n“Speaking in Zalaegerszeg, in western Hungary, on Monday, the Minister argued that countries’ supply of skilled professionals increasingly decided the international race for investments. Minister Szijjártó attended the inauguration of Széchenyi István University’s incubation and lodging building at the ZalaZone science park next to Europe’s largest vehicle test track,” a statement issued by the government noted.\n\nThe Minister explains that there is currently “fierce” global competition to secure investments amid the ongoing crisis.\n\nHe also pointed out that tax rates and political stability could be critical in such competition, revealing that Hungary’s nine per cent corporate tax rate was the lowest in Europe. At the same time, he said that Hungary offers a predictable and politically stable environment.\n\n“The quality of human resources is becoming the key factor in the race for investments. It’s not an exaggeration to say that Hungary’s competitiveness and future are greatly dependent on universities and the quality of the work being done there,” the Minister added.\n\nMoreover, in March, the Minister of innovation and technology László Palkovics revealed that the government has helped with 200 billion forints or €539.0 million in developing infrastructure and science parks in twenty Hungarian universities, which are either run by the state or by foundations supported by the government.\n\nAccording to him, the financing is the first phase of a development scheme of 2,700 billion forints. In addition, projects have been funded at Budapest University of Technology, Andrássy University, University of Veterinary Sciences, four medical universities, Óbuda University, Miskolc University and Hungarian Dance University.\n\nOver 74 per cent of female applicants were accepted full-time to universities and colleges in Hungary in 2021.\n\nBesides, Hungary has almost 37,000 international students in higher education, which is precise because Hungarian universities are considered the best educational institutions that offer high-quality training in many fields.\n\nHowever, this means that this number is almost three times greater than the number of Hungarians studying abroad, thus numbering around 13,038.",
    "Hungarian minister of finance: EU’s euro billions ‘closer’": "When the government’s commitments to the European Union are enforced, disputes with the EU over the recovery fund are expected to be resolved by mid-November, Mihály Varga, the finance minister, told a conference of economists in Szeged, in southern Hungary, on Friday.\n\nAs well as the economic crisis owing to the Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine, political disputes are also having a major effect on Hungary’s economic policy, Varga noted. One such dispute is EU pressure on Hungary in respect of the recovery fund, he said. Varga said the government would have to amend next year’s budget. While 2022 and 2023 are expected to be “difficult years”, there is reason to hope that Hungary’s economic growth will be back on track by 2024, he added.\n\nThe government’s budget deficit is expected to be around 6.1 percent of GDP this year, up from the previously targeted 4.19 percent, owing to additional gas purchases to ensure the necessary reserves, he said. Inflation, skyrocketing prices of energy resources and raw materials, this year’s drought, and migration “show that the decade ahead will not be easy”, Varga said. “Those crises point to an unprecedented loan and financing crisis,” hitting countries with high debts the hardest, he added.\n\nRead also Ridiculous? Hungarian politician gave away goldfish to save energy\n\nWhile Hungary’s robust food industry can protect the country from a food crisis, its exposure to foreign energy resources makes it vulnerable on that front, he noted. The current energy price increase was an “unforeseeable” situation that “was impossible to prepare for”, he said.\n\nMedium-term economic planning will therefore have to rely on energy efficiency, he said. Accordingly, the government has taken measures to cut gas consumption and reduce heating in public buildings, and has launched energy efficiency programmes, Varga said, citing an insulation programme for residential buildings as an example.\n\nMeanwhile, the government’s crisis management programme is focusing on large corporations and small and medium-sized firms, he said.\n\nRead also Dormitory placement costs may rise at several universities in Hungary\n\nSource: MTI",

    "Hungary: Shocking confession in Roma murder case garners zero interest": "The perpetrators ambushed their victims, set their homes on fire and then shot them as they sought to escape the flames. Or they killed them in their sleep. In all, the neo-Nazi group killed six people, among them a small child, and injured a further 55, most seriously. The only motivation for their crimes was the fact that their victims were Roma.\n\nThe right-wing terrorist series of murders in 2008/2009 targeted members of the Roma community and was the gravest set of racist crimes committed in Hungary's recent history — on par with the NSU murders in Germany that killed 10, among them 9 with a migrant background, and left one injured between 2000 and 2007. Here, too, the victims were targeted because they were foreigners. The murders in Hungary were carried out in the final months of the country's Socialist-Liberal government, as Hungary drifted further into corruption and political chaos. Just months later, Viktor Orban was elected to power with a two-thirds majority.\n\nThe case of Hungary's Roma murders was never entirely solved. Nevertheless, three perpetrators were handed life sentences in 2014, and an accomplice was given 13 years in prison. Still, despite ample evidence of their guilt — including DNA samples collected at various crime scenes — all of the men involved were unflinching in their claims of innocence. Only one of the four, Arpad Kiss, considered the leader of the group and the main suspect in the case, ever spoke of the crime in public, each time proclaiming his innocence.\n\nRoma were targeted in their homes and killed in their sleep\n\nAccidental murderer?\n\nNow, out of the blue, he has given a confession. Some 13 years on, the Budapest daily newspaper Magyar Nemzet — considered an unofficial megaphone for Prime Minister Viktor Orban and his Fidesz party — has published an interview with Kiss. The interview, dated August 31, provided a confession that was just as confusing as it was shocking.\n\nIn it, Kiss said: \"The crimes took place. We committed them.\" Although he described the crimes as a \"mistake,\" he never expressed true regret or remorse. Nor did the interviewer ever bother with follow-up questions. Kiss also described the group's proclamations of innocence before the court as a \"mistake.\"\n\nAlthough he was presented as the main perpetrator and organizer of the group, Kiss denied he any leadership position. He claimed he simply wanted to help his younger brother, and only became involved in the murders by chance. The bizarre climax of the interview came when Kiss suggested the last two murders in April and August 2009 could have been avoided if investigators had worked more effectively.\n\nUnnamed accomplices\n\nBut that wasn't the only statement that made the interview so remarkable. For the first time, Kiss publicly confirmed what most who have followed the case long suspected: accomplices and supporters enabled the murders by providing cash, guns and logistics. In the interview, Kiss referred to two helpers: A local politician from the far-right Jobbik party, and an employee at a gun shop who apparently had access to confidential information from the Interior Ministry through a relative.\n\nKiss did not name names, nor did he offer further information, though he claimed to have provided details on both accomplices to Hungarian investigators back in 2020. But official investigations went nowhere. \"We were held responsible, but those two went free,\" said Kiss in the interview. \"I find that shocking.\"\n\nHungarian court jails men for killing Roma (06.08.2013)\n\nNo reaction to the interview\n\nKiss said he hopes his sentence will be reviewed. He and the two other perpetrators were handed \"life\" sentences, which means at least 40 years behind bars in Hungary. In October 2021, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that practice illegal. Should Hungary change course, Kiss could go free in 2034.\n\nAlthough the Roma murders represent a uniquely racist, far-right crime spree, reaction to the interview has been nonexistent. A few media outlets offered short summaries, but neither Orban or his fellow Fidesz politicians have addressed it, nor has anyone from the opposition party. Journalists have also remained silent.\n\n\"No political side in Hungary has any interest in completely investigating and solving the Roma murders, that is consensus,\" filmmaker and journalist Andras B. Vagvolgyi told DW. Vagvolgyi is one of the few people who know the case inside and out. He attended the trial over the course of years, and published a book on the crimes in 2016. He has even been in contact with Arpad Kiss over the years, conducting yet unpublished interviews with him and working on a film about the crimes.\n\nVagvolgyi is convinced that a fundamental investigation into the case could prove the perpetrators had accomplices in the security and intelligence communities. He said a general lack of will to get to the bottom of the case, as well as a latent antiziganism, are both impeding closure. \"Many politicians have told me that people should finally just forget about it,\" said Vagvolgyi.\n\nPoliticians don't want a new investigation, and say people should just forget about the case\n\nAccomplices let off?\n\nLiberal ex-politician Jozsef Gulyas, who together with friends and acquaintances helps survivors of the crimes, agrees. \"Sadly, hardly anyone is still interested in the case. The victims are all but forgotten,\" he told DW. Gulyas was a member of the Parliamentary Committee on National Security that investigated the case back in 2009 and 2010.\n\n\"In light of Arpad Kiss' public statements,\" said Gulyas, \"the most important thing now would be to open a new investigation and demand intelligence agencies turn over whatever information they have on the case.\"\n\nIt remains unclear if that will happen. Neither Hungarian Police nor the National Bureau of Investigation replied to a DW query on whether a new investigation was planned, nor to the question of whether the investigation of accomplices was concluded unsuccessfully, as Kiss claimed.\n\nWhat role did the ex-prime minister play?\n\nPossible evidence that intelligence services were aware of events could be potentially explosive. For instance, Istvan Csontos, an informant for the Hungarian military's KBH security office, also happened to be the getaway driver in the last two attacks. He reportedly informed his contact at the KBH of his role, but that information is said to have not been passed on. Csontos was released from prison in August, after serving a 13-year sentence. He has never publicly spoken about the case.\n\nPolitical calculus may also be behind the prominent placement of the Kiss interview in a paper that is known as an unofficial media partner of the prime minister. In the interview, Kiss accused Socialist ex-Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany of having indirectly known about the crimes and quietly profiting from them. Gyurcsany is still active in politics, and is consistently the target of attacks from Orban and Fidesz. The former prime minister has never responded to calls to explain his ties to the case.\n\nThis article was translated from German by Jon Shelton"
