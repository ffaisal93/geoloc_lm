    "Anti-Ukrainian protest in Poland attracts no participants": "A protest against the reception of Ukrainian refugees in a town near Poland’s border with Ukraine at the weekend attracted no participants. Meanwhile, another event in Warsaw – at which two nationalist MPs spoke – drew only a small crowd.\n\nFigures from the nationalist Confederation (Konfederacja) have in recent weeks been promoting the slogan “Stop the Ukrainisation of Poland”. The party, which has long been opposed to mass immigration from Ukraine, claims that Ukrainian refugees are being given “privileges” not granted to Poles.\n\nOn Saturday, the party promoted a march and protest in Warsaw against the “threats posed by the massive influx of people from Ukraine”. One of Confederation’s leaders, Grzegorz Braun, called on all “Polish patriots” opposed to the “de-Polonisation and Ukrainisation of Poland” to attend.\n\nOn the day, between 150 and 200 people turned up, report Gazeta Wyborcza and Kresy.pl. They marched from Parade Square to the presidential palace, with one placard reading: “President [Andrzej Duda], you did more in one month for Ukrainians than in seven years for Poles.”\n\nParticipants also displayed banners with the logos of far-right groups All-Polish Youth (Młodzież Wszechpolska) and the National Movement (Ruch Narodowy). Among those to speak to the crowd were Braun and another of Confederation’s leaders, Krzysztof Bosak.\n\nBosak accused the Polish government of “pursuing a policy [to support refugees] beyond the financial capacity of Polish citizens”. He pointed to the rising prices of housing and the costs of providing benefits to Ukrainians as evidence.\n\nA group of counterprotesters held signs saying “Down with fascism”, “Braun to Moscow” and “Poland is home to everyone”.\n\nPanie Pośle, moja 7-letnia siostra chodziła do polskiej szkoły w kwietniu, ale już wróciła na Ukrainę.

Jak można w czasie wojny za wschodnią granicą mówić o ukrainizacji Polski? https://t.co/exGlRVVNoQ — Alina Makarczuk (@Alina_Makarczuk) September 24, 2022\n\nOn Sunday in Sanok, a town of 37,000 in southeaster Poland near the border with Ukraine, Karolina Pikuła, a Confederation activist and associate of Braun, organised another protest against the “Ukrainisation of Poland” on the market square.\n\nHowever, during the event – which Pikuła streamed live on YouTube – no one turned up. The only interest shown was from a man who came to argue with her.\n\nAfter Polish media reported on the lack of turnout, Pikuła, who has also tried to organise other protests in the region, defiantly tweeted that “we will continue to relentlessly do our work [against] the deliberate colonisation of Poland by Ukraine” and that she “will talk even to the first passerby”.\n\nThe far right organised an anti-Ukrainian protest in the town of Sanok and precisely zero people turned up.

But they have consistently failed pic.twitter.com/0BmR1YiFcl — Daniel Tilles (@danieltilles1) September 25, 2022\n\nPoland has been the largest recipient of refugees from Ukraine, millions of whom have crossed its border since Russia’s invasion in February. It is estimated that between 1 and 1.5 million remain in the country, as well as a similar number of Ukrainians who have previously migrated to Poland.\n\nPoles have been overwhelmingly welcoming of the arrivals. A poll in July showed that 77% of the public had been involved in helping refugees, spending around 9-10 billion zloty (€1.93-2.14 billion) out of their own pockets on doing so.\n\nOther polling has shown overwhelming support for Ukraine in its defence against Russian aggression, and for the Polish government’s strong pro-Ukrainian and anti-Russian stance.\n\nHowever, from the early stages of the crisis, Confederation – which has 12 MPs in parliament – and other far-right groups have sought to raise concern about the mass influx of Ukrainians and the impact it could have economically, politically and culturally on Poland.\n\nIn recent weeks, the hashtag #StopUkrainizacjiPolski (#StopTheUkrainisationOfPoland) has often been trending on Twitter. However, analysis by the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab found that it had been boosted by “inauthentic” activity from “accounts exhibiting signs of bot-like behavior”.\n\nResearch by state pollster CBOS found that, whereas in March only 3% of the public believed Poland should not accept Ukrainian refugees from conflict zones, by July that had risen to 11%.\n\nA largely inauthentic network in #Poland pushed an anti-Ukrainian refugee hashtag to trending. Its primary accounts created a false impression regarding its relative popularity in the country.https://t.co/APAkKqr3ux — DFRLab (@DFRLab) September 4, 2022\n\nMain image credit: Karolina Pikuła/Facebook (screenshot)",
    "Poland welcomes right-wing election successes in Italy and Sweden": "Leading figures from Poland’s ruling camp, including Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, have welcomed the electoral success of right-wing and far-right parties in Italy yesterday, as well as in Sweden’s recent election.\n\nImmediately after exit polls last night predicted a victory for the Brothers of Italy (FdI) party – which sits in the same European grouping as Poland’s ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party – Morawiecki tweeted congratulations to Giorgia Meloni, FdI’s leader and the likely new Italian prime minister.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, with FdI predicted to win the election, Morawiecki had declared himself “happy that a tremor is running through the EU”, reported the Polish Press Agency (PAP).\n\nWith the likely new governments in Italy and Sweden – where the nationalist Sweden Democrats are now the second largest party – “watching the interests of nation-states…Europe is becoming a Europe of real values”, said Morawiecki.\n\nPiS chairman Jarosław Kaczyński had also declared Sunday to be “a day of hope, hope that the EU will start to change”, reports news website wPolityce.\n\nJarosław Kaczyński: Wybory we Włoszech?

Polish deputy foreign minister Paweł Jabłoński hailed FdI’s “historic victory”.\n\nDeputy justice minister Michał Wójcik, who belongs to PiS’s hard-right junior coalition partner United Poland (Solidarna Polska), said that Meloni’s victory was a “defeat for [European Commission President Ursula] von der Leyen, the representative of the anti-democratic forces in the EU”.\n\n“Abnormality in the EU is ending,” declared Wójcik. “The rule of manipulators and lunatics in the European Commission is slowly coming to an end.”\n\nPrzedstawicielka antydemokratycznych sił w UE von der Leyen doznała klęski.

    "Roger Waters gigs cancelled in Poland after Ukraine comments": "The Pink Floyd co-founder, who was booked to play in Poland in April, denies claims that he or his management cancelled events.\n\nConcerts by Pink Floyd co-founder Roger Waters have been cancelled by a venue in the Polish city of Krakow after the artist’s comments on the war in Ukraine caused a storm of criticism.\n\nWaters was to appear in Krakow in April, but Polish media reports about an open letter he wrote to Ukraine’s first lady Olena Zelenska urging her to ask her husband to choose “a different route” and criticising the West for supplying Ukraine with arms provoked a fierce backlash.\n\n“Live Nation Polska and Tauron Arena Krakow have cancelled Roger Waters’ concert,” organisers said in a statement on the venue’s website. They did not elaborate on the reason for the cancellation.\n\nOn Saturday, state-run news agency PAP reported that a spokesperson for the Tauron Arena said Waters’ management cancelled the concert without giving a reason.\n\nPoland counts itself among Kyiv’s staunchest allies, and public support for the Ukrainian cause is very high.\n\nLocal councillors in Krakow were to vote on a resolution declaring Waters “persona non grata” on Wednesday.\n\n‘Leave Them Kids Alone!’\n\nIn a social media post, Waters said it was not true that he or his management cancelled the concerts and criticised local councillor Lukasz Wantuch over the vote to declare him unwelcome in the city.\n\n“Lukasz Wantuch has threatened to hold a meeting asking the council to declare me ‘persona non grata’ because of my public efforts to encourage all involved in the disastrous war in Ukraine, especially the governments of the USA and Russia, to work towards a negotiated peace,” Waters wrote in a post on Facebook.\n\n“If Mr Lukasz Wantuch achieves his aim, and my forthcoming concerts in Krakow are cancelled, it will be a sad loss for me, because I have been looking forward to sharing my message of love with the people of Poland.\n\n“Lukasz Wantuch seems to know nothing of my history of working, all my life, at some personal cost, in the service of human rights,” Waters added.\n\nParaphrasing the words of his hit single Another Brick in the Wall, Waters also wrote: “Hey!

    "Belarusian propaganda targets Poland": "\"When Putin talks about the threat from NATO, he means the United States and possibly Britain. When Lukashenko talks about the threat from NATO, he means Poland and Lithuania,\" said Polish journalist Michal Potocki.\n\nPotocki thinks Belarus' authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenko, deems it a threat that Polish television station Belsat broadcasts from Poland to Belarus in the Belarusian language, and that the Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya is living in exile in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius.\n\nJournalist Michal Potocki has been drawing attention to the oppression of the Polish minority in Belarus\n\nLukashenko's view of Poland is primarily influenced by the events of August 2020, when there were mass protests in Belarus against the disputed presidential election, said Alexander Friedman, a Belarusian historian. \"Lukashenko believes that just because Nexta is based in Warsaw, the Polish state must be behind it,\" he said.\n\nThe Nexta media outlet, distributed via Telegram, was founded by the Belarusian activist Stsiapan Putsila, who currently lives in Warsaw. More than 2 million subscribers turned to Nexta during the protests to stay informed about what was happening. Belarus has classified the channel as extremist.\n\nBelarusian political scientist Alexander Klaskovsky stressed that Lukashenko has always been anti-Western, but said his rhetoric intensified after he \"became an accomplice in Russia's aggression against Ukraine.\" Klaskovsky said Lukashenko is simply trying to justify himself with statements like: \"If we hadn't attacked, they would have attacked us first.\"\n\nWhat lies behind Lukashenko's antipathy toward Poland?\n\nFriedman assumes Lukashenko's antipathy toward neighboring Poland developed during the Soviet era. Back then, Poland was seen as a country that still bore characteristics of the \"feudal era.\"\n\nKlaskovsky also believes Lukashenko's prejudices are based on stereotypes about the \"exploitative Polish ruling class.\"\n\n\"He thinks the Poles want to conquer half, or even all, of Belarus. Actually, there isn't a single serious politician in Poland who pursues revanchist ideas,\" said Klaskovsky.\n\nKlaskovsky said Belarusian propaganda picks on historical themes in order to manipulate people. \"There was indeed a time when the western part of Belarus was under Polish rule, and the Belarusians who lived there were not treated well. But should we reopen these wounds? Today, Poles and Ukrainians are demonstrating that historical resentments can be put aside,\" he said.\n\nPoland erects new border fence with Belarus\n\nVadim Gigin, head of the Belarusian national public association Belarusian Society Knowledge, has expressed the view that Minsk should demand reparations from Warsaw for the years 1921 to 1939, when western Belarus was part of Poland.\n\n\"This issue has arisen against the background of Polish claims against Germany and has been seized on by propagandists in Belarus and Russia,\" said historian Friedman. However, from a legal point of view, he said, Belarusian claims are completely untenable.\n\nDestruction of Polish gravesites\n\nBelarus has a difficult relationship with all its neighbors, said Klaskovsky, adding that Russia is the only one it doesn't dare confront. It does, however, trample on the Poles, in this case literally: the graves of Polish soldiers.\n\nIn July, graves of soldiers from the Polish Home Army in Belarus were destroyed, triggering outrage in Warsaw. The Home Army was a resistance and military organization in German-occupied Poland during World War II. It was made up of volunteers, whose goal was the liberation of Poland from the occupying German army. After the Soviet Red Army invaded they were disarmed; many officers were shot, or imprisoned in the Soviet gulag. Some continued their resistance, this time against communist rule.\n\nFriedman believes the destruction of the graves replicates the Soviet attitude to places of burial. \"If cemeteries are not their own but those of their enemies, they are simply destroyed,\" he said. \"That was what the Soviets did to Jewish and Catholic cemeteries, for example, and also to German ones after the war. The Belarusian state power sees the graves of soldiers of the Polish Home Army as enemy gravesites.\"\n\nAccording to Friedman, it is no coincidence that Belarusian propaganda concentrates on the Home Army, or on Poland of the 1920s, a period that occupies a special place in Polish memorial culture. \"This is an important historical period for the current conservative government in Poland, and attacking this period is also an attack on the current Polish government,\" he said.\n\nIs Belarusian propaganda achieving its objectives?\n\nFriedman: In Poland, 'Lukashenko ... is just seen as a vassal of Russia'\n\nAccording to Polish journalist Michal Potocki, the destruction of graves and demands for reparations do hurt Warsaw — and the Belarusian government knows this. Potocki also pointed out that independent organizations of the Polish minority in Belarus are being suppressed, and Polish schools are being closed.\n\nKlaskovsky refers to Lukashenko's announcement that he intended to clarify the \"orientation\" of Belarusian citizens who possessed a \"Karta Polaka,\" an identity card issued by the Polish state confirming that a person belongs to the Polish nation. More than 160,000 Belarusians with Polish roots are in possession of such a document. Lukashenko declared that these people should report to the Belarusian authorities. Klaskovsky said Lukashenko believes these people to be a so-called \"fifth column\" — Belarusian citizens whose loyalty is actually to Poland.\n\nHowever, Klaskovsky believes that, in spite of the propaganda, Belarusian society does not regard Poland as an enemy. Opinion polls indicate that the propaganda narrative isn't working; meanwhile, the rhetoric from Belarusian authorities scarcely registers in Poland.\n\n\"People do discuss it, but it's not the No. 1 topic,\" said Potocki. \"Poles talk about the economic situation and the energy crisis, and when the conversation turns to foreign policy, of course they talk about Ukraine. As far as Lukashenko is concerned, he's just seen as a vassal of Russia.\"\n\nThis article was originally published in Russian",

    "Poland turns away Russians at border": "Poland has refused entry to dozens of Russians trying to cross its land borders, saying they “may be dangerous to our country”. A particularly large number sought to enter on Wednesday and Thursday, after Vladimir Putin announced a partial mobilisation and many Russians consequently sought to flee the country.\n\nOn Monday, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia introduced new restrictions preventing the entry of most Russians. Previously, those four countries – all of which share land borders with Russia – had been the entry point for around two thirds of the million Russians who have entered the EU by land since Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking to the Polish Press Agency, Polish border guard spokeswoman Anna Michalska said that over the following days 54 Russians had been refused entry: two on Monday, nine on Tuesday, 17 on Wednesday and 26 on Thursday.\n\nHowever, between Monday and Friday 1,770 Russians were admitted to Poland while 2,342 left, reports PAP. Poland and the Baltic states’ new entry restrictions make exceptions for certain categories of Russians, including “dissidents”, “humanitarian cases”, family members and holders of residence permits in EU countries.\n\nSince Putin announced the partial mobilisation, some have suggested that Poland and the Baltic states should allow entry to Russians seeking to avoid military service.\n\nHowever, on Friday Stanisław Żaryn, the spokesman for Poland’s security services, rejected the idea. “We absolutely should not admit such people en masse,” he said, quoted by RMF24. “These are people who may be dangerous to our country.”\n\n“We do not have reliable information showing that these people want to flee because they are rebelling against the Russian government,” added Żaryn. “These people probably want to flee because they are afraid of the individual situation related to being drafted into the army.”\n\nA similar position has been taken by the Baltic states.

    "Poland condemns EU chief von der Leyen’s “scandalous, anti-democratic” remarks": "Poland’s ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party has condemned the “scandalous” remarks this week by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen about Poland, Hungary and Italy. It says they are further evidence of the EU’s “anti-democratic” interference in the domestic politics of member states.\n\nIn a speech at Princeton University, von der Leyen addressed concerns over the national-conservative governments in Budapest and Warsaw – which have regularly clashed with Brussels over the rule of law – and the potential victory of hard-right parties in Italy’s upcoming election.\n\n“If things go in a difficult direction [in Italy] – and I’ve spoken about Hungary and Poland – we have tools [to deal with it],” said the commission president.\n\nShe also referred to Poland more specifically, saying that the government there “does not want to change laws in the way we have [agreed] to restore the independence of the judiciary”. Therefore the EU “will not disburse any money…[until] they do the reforms agreed upon”.\n\n\"It is now unfolding what I was fearing but was predictable. Poland does not want to change laws in the way we [agreed] in the contract, to restore the independence of the judiciary. We will not disburse any money…[until] they do the reforms agreed upon\" pic.twitter.com/A027d3Fo7p — Notes from Poland 🇵🇱 (@notesfrompoland) September 23, 2022\n\nThe latter remarks referred to an ongoing dispute over around €36 billion in EU post-pandemic recovery funds for Poland, which the European Commission has frozen over rule-of-law concerns. Warsaw, however, insists it has met the EU’s demands and that the money is being blocked for political reasons.\n\nSpeaking today to the Polish Press Agency (PAP), Radosław Fogiel, a PiS spokesman, said that von der Leyen’s latest remarks “prove what we as PiS have been saying for a long time: that decisions concerning, for example, the [recovery funds] are purely political”.\n\n“Her speech was full of beautiful words about democracy, but when it comes down to it, it turns out that von der Leyen is openly trying to influence the democratic processes in a democratic state, suggesting that if she does not like Italians’ choice, the right tools – as she put it – will be used,” said Fogiel.\n\n“This is exactly the same anti-democratic point of view presented by the Polish opposition,” he continued. “They adhere to the principle that democracy is great provided that ‘our own’ win.”\n\n“It is clear that this is a group that has completely failed to internalise the principles of democracy and does not understand what it is all about,” Fogiel concluded. “They consider it only a facade that is to legitimise their own governments, and in fact they do not care about the choice of citizens, they do not take it into account.”\n\nFormer foreign minister Witold Waszczykowski, now a PiS MEP, also condemned von der Leyen’s “blackmail and interference in the democratic process”. He warned that they would further turn Italians against EU institutions and encourage more of them to “vote for parties that defend sovereignty”.\n\n“In the long run, it could be even worse,” Waszczykowski told PAP. “If another state is stigmatised and [targeted] with instruments beyond European law, it may come to the conclusion that it will be more comfortable outside the EU. The UK, apart from a temporary period of problems, has suffered no harm. It shows that there is life outside the EU.”\n\nPiS has in recent years sought to build closer ties with other right-wing and far-right eurosceptic parties in the EU, including Italy’s Lega and Brothers of Italy parties, which are expected to do well in the upcoming elections.\n\nThe grouping – which also includes France’s Marine Le Pen – say they want to create an EU in which member states have more power and European institutions have less.\n\nSince Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, however, such efforts have been put on hold, publicly at least, given that those parties’ generally sympathetic position towards the Kremlin is at odds with PiS’s strongly anti-Russian line.\n\nMain image credit: © European Union 2022 – Source: EP (under CC BY 4.0)",
    "What’s behind Poland’s reparation debate?": "Ever since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, Poland has received daily threats from Russian propagandists that it will be next. Yet despite these high stakes, Poland’s Law and Justice (PiS) party government has decided to start a fight with Germany—one of its closest allies—by demanding huge war reparations for the destruction caused by Hitler’s Third Reich.\n\nOn 1 September, the anniversary of the outbreak of World War II, PiS Chairman Jaroslaw Kaczynski presented a report that puts the sum of Poland’s wartime losses at US$1.3 trillion. While PiS has been talking about reparations since it came to power seven years ago, this is the first time that it has broached the topic with Germany. In fact, the issue is both formally and morally unambiguous—and the correct policy lies in the opposite direction.\n\nAfter World War II, the Allies decided that injured parties would receive material, rather than financial, reparations. German factories would be dismantled and relocated, or work done by the Germans would benefit the aggrieved states, which were divided into an 18-country ‘western mass’ and an ‘eastern mass’ comprising the Soviet Union and Poland. The eastern mass took its share mainly from the Soviet occupation zone in eastern Germany.\n\nPoland was to receive 15% of the eastern share, and on 16 August, 1945, the governments in Warsaw and Moscow signed an agreement to regulate the transfer of reparations. The USSR was to receive up to US$10 billion (at 1938 prices), but historians estimate that it eventually took US$3–4 billion—about a third of East Germany’s potential production. By this time, the USSR was also already dismantling and looting assets that had been set aside for Poland under the Potsdam Agreement.\n\nThe Kremlin then imposed a harsh condition on Poland: to receive its due share of German reparations, Poland would have to produce and export its coal to the Soviet Union at an extremely low price. In the event, this arrangement proved to be more costly than the reparations that were coming in. In 1957, Poland agreed to forgo collecting any additional reparations in exchange for ending the ruinous export condition. The allocation of German reparations for Poland had been a sham. Of the US$3 billion that the Soviets had collected (in the form of factories, ships, cars, motorcycles, bicycles and rolling stock), Poland received only US$225 million (7.5%).\n\nThen, in December 1970, Poland reaffirmed its renunciation of reparations claims under a new agreement with West Germany, which recognised the Polish border on the Oder and Neisse Rivers—in what had been pre-war Germany. Without this acknowledgement of post-war borders, the very existence of the Polish state would have been called into question.\n\nFormally speaking, then, the question of reparations is closed. And, as the Polish constitution makes clear in Article 241, ‘international agreements concluded in accordance with the previous constitutional order (including under the 1952 Constitution of the People’s Republic of Poland) are treated as ratified international agreements with prior consent expressed by law’. Citing the same documents, the German government also considers the subject closed.\n\nTo be sure, Germany does indeed owe a large historic debt to Poland. German aggression in World War II caused unprecedented destruction, including the total destruction of the capital, the erasure of innumerable Polish cultural artifacts and the deaths of six million Polish citizens (including three million who were Jewish—a fact that Kaczynski does not bother to mention). Making matters worse, the conclusion of the war forced Poland under the Soviet boot, depriving it of independence and development for the next half-century.\n\nAnyone who visited Poland in 1989 will recall how poor, grey and ugly the country was after four decades of communism. Traces of this dismal legacy are still ubiquitous today.\n\nOn the other hand, one also must acknowledge that Poland’s economic success over the past three decades would not have been possible without Germany, which was also the most enthusiastic advocate for Poland’s accession to the European Union and NATO. Yes, many Polish banks and companies are owned by entities in Germany, which is thus where the profits go. But such arrangements gave Poles access to the capital they needed to lift their country out of ruin. These mutually beneficial exchanges have fostered a spirit of reconciliation and benevolence between the two countries.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Kaczynski’s demands for reparations have evoked withering criticism everywhere except in the PiS-controlled media. Many see yet another example of the exceptional backwardness of a man who is famous for dwelling in the past. But Kaczynski apparently believes that issuing such demands will improve PiS’s position ahead of next year’s general election. And, of course, raising the issue now is a helpful distraction from the government’s struggle against rampant inflation (now more than 16%) and sky-high energy prices.\n\nStill, Kaczynski has let the genie out of the bottle. On 14 September, the Sejm (parliament) adopted a resolution, signed even by most opposition MPs, calling on Germany to pay compensation. There are two fundamental differences. First, there is no talk of reparations, which are formally unobtainable, but of compensation for losses. Second, the resolution was supported by the opposition, including Donald Tusk’s liberal Civic Platform and the Left, led by Adrian Zandberg, who said that ‘only a teaspoon was left of his family’s property’ after the war. As a Civic Platform MP explained, ‘A new Polish government will be formed next year to handle these matters properly.’\n\nKaczynski doubtless was hoping that the opposition would renounce all Polish claims to reparations. By apparently joining the bandwagon, Civic Platform can undercut his electoral strategy. But this also means that the issue has begun a life separate from and beyond what Kaczynski intended. The outcome is uncertain, but, paradoxically, the best safeguard for Germany may be Kaczynski himself, whose outrageous and legally dubious proposals for resolving such issues cannot be taken seriously.",

    "Going nuclear: Poland and Hungary on diverging energy paths": "Warsaw, Poland – Debate over the current and future role of nuclear energy has waged for years in Central and Eastern Europe. But since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, this discussion has become a key concern in regional plans for energy independence and security.\n\nFar from leading to a consensual outlook, the war itself has highlighted divided visions on nuclear energy, specifically regarding the role that Russia should play in future developments.\n\nBreaking away from legacy\n\nThe shadow of the Soviet hegemony still looms large in the sphere of nuclear energy across the entire region. Beginning as early as the late 1950’s, the USSR facilitated the development of nuclear energy within the COMECON group.\n\nOwing to this, many countries in the region today – including the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and Lithuania among others – but with the notable exception of Poland, have inherited Soviet-built nuclear infrastructure. This legacy of Russian technology and design, now administered by the Russian state-corporation Rosatom, has resulted in a continued reliance on Russia for both the maintenance of reactors and the supply of nuclear fuel.\n\nIn the current crisis, this has been a difficult situation to address.\n\nConspicuously, since the Russian invasion of February 2022, Rosatom has avoided the same sanctions applied to other Russia-based energy suppliers such as Gazprom and Lukoil. This is likely a testament to the acute dependency that European reactors still have on Rosatom and will continue to have in the near future if difficult changes are not made.\n\nUltimately, this approach has shifted responsibility to individual countries as to whether they continue to cooperate with Russia.\n\nYet even with these inherent challenges of transition, several countries on the EU’s eastern flank have already demonstrated a willingness to break away from reliance on Russia. In May Finland scrapped plans to cooperate with Rosatom in building a new nuclear plant, Hanhikivi 1, citing the risks of renewed conflict in Ukraine.\n\nSimilarly, in June the Czech Republic, which had already banned Russian tender for future nuclear development, signed a deal with both Westinghouse and France’s Framatome to supply plant fuel, replacing Rosatom.\n\nBut the two opposing cases of Poland and Hungary provide the starkest contrast in terms of how countries in Central Europe can relate to Russian dominance in the field of nuclear energy, either maintaining the status quo or setting a precedent for change.\n\nThe Polish exception\n\nIn 1989 Poland discontinued the construction of what would have been their first nuclear power plant, located in Żarnowiec on the Baltic sea. At the time Soviet influence was rapidly waning, and there was little or no will to continue such a project, in view of both the Chernobyl disaster, only three years prior, and a new energy policy diverging from the interests of what would soon become the Russian Federation.\n\nWhile this decision did ultimately prevent Poland from inheriting a nuclear legacy tied to Russia, it also deprived Poland of experience in the industry. Any future pursuit of this power source would have to work from the ground up. However, this tabula rasa left many options open as the debate around nuclear energy reappeared in following decades.\n\nIn 2014, the Polish Council of Ministers finally approved the first iteration of a long-term “Polish Nuclear Power Program” (PNP), which consolidated many years of strategic thinking to develop the sector. Energy security, and particularly energy independence from Russia, was already a key policy concern in Poland.\n\nThe Polish government is currently entertaining proposals from several foreign energy companies. In October 2021, France’s EDF submitted an offer to build 4 to 6 nuclear reactors in Poland, followed in April 2022 by a similar offer from South Korea’s KHNP and in September by the US’s Westinghouse and Bechtel. Once the final selection is made this autumn, the first plant is set to be operational by 2033, located in the Choczewo municipality of Lubiatowo-Kopalino.\n\nThe plan in its current state still faces hurdles. One notable development this summer has been the dismissal of Poland’s longtime “energy czar” and government plenipotentiary for strategic energy infrastructure Piotr Naimski. This has been largely taken as a sign of PiS party/government infighting, and a potential reshuffle of the government’s long-term strategy.\n\nThe highly ambitious schedule presented in the Polish Nuclear Power Program has also been criticized for its proposed 2033 launch date, which some say is unrealistic. That notwithstanding, Poland has made great strides in developing nuclear energy without relying on the Russian backing, which has been standard in the region for decades.\n\nHungary: by design or fait accompli\n\nIn contrast to Poland, Hungary has had a long history of nuclear development going back all the way to the 1950’s with their first research reactor coming online in 1959. At the time further progress in this sector necessitated cooperation with the Soviet Union.\n\nIn the 1960’s Hungary entered into an agreement with the USSR to build a nuclear power plant in Paks, 100 km south of Budapest. As with other countries in the former Eastern bloc, Hungary’s nuclear capacity became based on Soviet design and technology which, in itself, makes energy independence a more difficult and costly task.\n\nThis process resulted in the construction of four nuclear reactors at the Paks site with all four coming online between 1982 and 1987. Initially these reactors were designed with a 30-year operating lifetime, after which they would be due for replacement. This would have meant that they would all be replaced between 2012 and 2017.\n\nHowever, in 2005, the Hungarian parliament voted to further extend the operating lifetime of the reactors by 20 years, an extended deadline for replacement Hungary is nevertheless rapidly approaching. And while due diligence has been taken with regard to safety, relying on 50-year-old Soviet infrastructure will undoubtedly raise concerns.\n\nTo address this issue the Hungarian government began an open tender after 2010 in which several companies from the US, France and South Korea expressed interest. Even then Rosatom was a strong contender, which was further highlighted by Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban’s growing relationship with Russia’s Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn 2014, this special relationship became all too apparent as the project (which would be Paks II) was suddenly awarded to Rosatom without competition. In a follow-up, Russia agreed to finance 80% of the roughly $ 12 billion construction cost, in a move that has been called an overt purchase of political influence. Highly controversial, this decision set the stage for future rapprochement between Hungary and Russia, the effects of which are all too clear today.\n\nHungary has recently rejected demands to sanction Russia and continued to work with Russia on Paks II, with the opening of construction being announced as recently as August 2022. For Hungary the die is cast.\n\nFor Hungary, the large political and financial investment that Orban’s regime has made into Russian-built nuclear energy, and the time constraints posed by aging nuclear infrastructure, may shed some light on why Hungary has gone to such lengths to preserve its relationship with Moscow in the face of broad condemnation.\n\nFor Poland, independence from Russian nuclear infrastructure has given the country a unique opportunity to direct its own capacities and develop agreements on freer terms. The next months will show which company wins the tender for the Polish nuclear infrastructure.\n\nAs close as Hungary and Poland may have been in a number of areas, their approach to nuclear energy underlines a fundamental disagreement between the two. Embodying two distinct trajectories of nuclear development, they will likely serve as an indicator of changing times for nuclear energy.\n\nBy Nathan Alan-Lee\n\nNathan is a research assistant working with the Jagiellonian University in Krakow and a PhD student at the UCL School of Slavonic and East European Studies.

    "Tax changes related to employment in Poland from the payer’s perspective": "New regulations that have significantly changed the Polish tax system for the second time in 2022 came into force on July 1. The tax amendment, the so-called Polish Deal 2.0, modifies the personal income tax (PIT) regulations introduced on January 1 2022.\n\nBelow is a summary of the key changes introduced by the Polish Deal 2.0 with regard to the taxation of employment income.\n\nReduced PIT rate\n\nOne of the main changes is the reduction of the lowest PIT rate from 17% to 12%, applicable to income up to PLN 120,000 ($26,000). The change relates to taxpayers settling their taxes under general rules; for example, employees, freelancers, and board members. The new tax scale is to be applied to income for the entire year 2022, whereas tax remitters apply it when calculating advance tax payments on salaries paid from July 1 2022.\n\nAs of January 1 2022, the annual tax-free amount for taxpayers earning income taxed under the general rules was increased to PLN 30,000. Although the tax-free amount remains unchanged, due to the reduction of the lowest tax rate, a new monthly tax-reducing amount is lower and amounts to PLN 300 (PLN 3,600 per year).\n\nElimination of the middle-class relief\n\nWith the entry into force of the Polish Deal 2.0, the middle-class relief was repealed. The relief had been in effect since the beginning of 2022, and applied to employees who fell within the appropriate income limit, both on a monthly and annual basis.\n\nHowever, it was widely criticised due to the complicated algorithms used for its calculation, differing at the monthly and annual calculation stages. Importantly, the elimination of the relief applies to the entire year 2022. Taxpayers can still settle their annual tax for 2022 according to the middle-class relief, if it is more favourable for them.\n\nElimination of double counting of PIT advance payments\n\nWith the introduction of substantial tax changes on January 1 2022, the tax burden of many taxpayers increased significantly. This situation met a fusillade of criticism. To alleviate the situation, the Polish legislator introduced a mechanism of double counting of PIT advance payments.\n\nAccording to the obligation, a tax remitter paying income to employees and freelancers up to PLN 12,800 per month was supposed to calculate advance payments under the rules binding in 2021 and the rules of 2022 and choose the more favourable option for the taxpayer. The Polish Deal 2.0 repeals the obligation of double counting of PIT advance payments.\n\nIncreased remuneration of the tax remitter for timely payment\n\nUntil July 1 2022, the remuneration of the tax remitter for the timely payment of taxes to the state budget was 0.3% of the amount of the collected taxes. The remuneration of tax remitters calculating monthly tax advances on income taxed according to the tax scale has been increased to 0.6% of the amount of collected taxes.\n\nStatements affecting the calculation of PIT advance payments\n\nThe employer calculates PIT advances using the tax-reducing amount if a PIT-2 statement is delivered by the employee. In response to taxpayers' problems with PIT-2 statements, the legislator has provided a new solution. The taxpayer will be able to submit a PIT-2 statement to a maximum of three tax remitters, indicating that a given tax remitter is entitled to reduce the advance payment by the amount constituting:\n\n1/12 of the tax-reducing amount;\n\n1/24 of the tax-reducing amount; or\n\n1/36 of the tax-reducing amount.\n\nMoreover, the Polish Deal 2.0 will provide for the possibility of applying the tax-reducing amount on a monthly basis to the income of individuals employed under a contract of mandate or contract for specific work. The possibility is reserved only for employees at present.\n\nIn addition, the possibility to submit a request to the tax remitter not to withhold PIT advance payments – which is available, among others, to contractors and persons performing specific works – will be extended to employees. Taxpayers are entitled to submit an application if they expect that their annual income subject to the tax scale taxation will not exceed PLN 30,000.\n\nB2B contracts\n\nAn employment contract is one of the basic forms of employment in Poland. However, employees are increasingly choosing alternative forms of employment.\n\nA B2B contract can be an attractive alternative to the employment contract. This is the trend in the IT sector in Poland, where over a third of the specialists are working under B2B contracts, and paying, in general, lower PIT than employees.\n\nThe Polish Deal 2.0 also introduced many changes for entrepreneurs. One of the main amendments is the possibility of changing the form of taxation of business income (revenue) to the tax scale applied in 2022 during or after the end of the year.\n\nIn addition, the Polish Deal 2.0 introduced a possibility of partial deduction of health contributions, depending on the chosen method of taxation.",
    "Poland’s east depopulates as suburbs grow, census data show": "Eastern Poland has seen population declines over the last decade while areas around large cities have attracted more residents, newly released census data show.\n\nThe figures also show that Wrocław has overtaken Łódź as Poland’s third largest city, while Poland’s total population fell by 1.2% from 2011 to 2021, to 38,036,118 people. The number of areas in which people aged over 65 make up more than 20% of the population increased tenfold.\n\nOf the 2,477 municipalities in Poland, 1,776 had a smaller population in 2021 than a decade earlier. In 1,181, the decline in the population was larger than 5% and in 397 larger than 10%, according to the data published by Statistics Poland (GUS), a state agency, on Tuesday.\n\nThe majority of areas with the largest population declines were in the east, an area that is more rural and historically less economically developed than western parts of the country.\n\n“Most of the municipalities that recorded a large decrease in population (above 10%) are located in the areas of the so-called “eastern wall”,” wrote GUS. “A particular concentration of such municipalities can be found in the Podlaskie region.”\n\nIn Podlaskie almost half of municipalities noted a population decline over the last decade. By contrast, areas around large metropolises saw the strongest growth.\n\n“The highest population growth was mainly observed in municipalities located in the immediate vicinity of the largest urban centres, which is a result of the appeal of the large agglomerations as attractive labour markets,” said GUS, adding that the expansion of suburbs was also observed in medium-sized cities.\n\nAt the same time, the proportion of municipalities where the percentage of people aged 65 and over was higher than 20% increased significantly throughout Poland, but especially in eastern Poland.\n\nIn 2011, there were only 51 such municipalities in Poland, or 2% of all municipalities in the country. In 2021, the number of municipalities with a share of older people exceeding 20% had increased tenfold, and they already accounted for more than one fifth of all municipalities in in Poland\n\n“The ageing of the population is clearly evident,” said GUS’s president Dominik Rozkrut, quoted by news portal Money.pl. “The young are leaving, the old are getting older. This poses a major challenge for social policy.”\n\nIn the cities themselves, however, the population declined. Of the 37 cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants, only eight saw a population growth: Zielona Góra, Warsaw, Rzeszów, Wrocław, Kraków, Gdańsk, Opole and Białystok.\n\nThe remaining cities recorded losses, the largest in Katowice and Łódź (a loss of around 8%), followed by Kielce and Bydgoszcz. That decline saw Łódź lose its status as Poland’s third largest city, with its population (now 670,642) dropping below Wrocław’s (which rose to 672,929)\n\nPoland’s two largest cities remain Warsaw (1,8602,81) and Kraków (800,653), while Łódź is followed by Poznań (546,859), Gdańsk (486,022), Szczecin (396,168) and Bydgoszcz (337,666).\n\nMain photo credit: Bartosz Żygadło/Unsplash",
    "No real obstacle to receiving recovery funds by Poland says Kaczyński": "Kaczyński told a public radio station on Sunday that \"certain conditions (known as milestones - PAP) imposed by the EC have been fulfilled\" and that Von der Leyen's statement is \"outrageous since she approved this Polish allocation here, in Warsaw.\" Przemysław Piątkowski/PAP\n\nJarosław Kaczyński, leader of Poland's ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, has said there is no reason why Poland should not receive funds from its National Recovery Plan (KPO) as he commented on earlier statement by the European Commission (EC) chief.\n\nOn Thursday, Ursula von der Leyen warned that the EU's post-pandemic recovery funds will not be unlocked for Poland if the country does not bring back the independence of the judiciary.\n\nKaczyński told a public radio station on Sunday that \"At the moment, there is no real obstacle for us to receive the funds, because certain conditions (known as milestones - PAP) imposed by the EC have been fulfilled\" and that Von der Leyen's statement is \"outrageous since she approved this Polish allocation here, in Warsaw.\"\n\n\"When blackmail started from the European Parliament that she would be dismissed she later changed her mind,\" he said.\n\n\"We are entitled to these funds... but if someone wants to hit the dog, they will find the stick,\" Kaczyński added.\n\nAccording to him, \"milestones are nothing extraordinary, all countries have milestones (...) these are simply points describing subsequent things to be done.\"\n\nQuestioned whether these funds were already written off by the Polish government, Kaczyński said that \"for now the most important EU funds (structural and cohesion funds - PAP) are at a stake... and according to statements by several commissioners, including those unfavourable to us, these are not endangered.\"\n\nHe added that the government will anyway start financing projects under the KPO through its own resources.\n\n\"And if, and there are many indications of this, there is such a moment, perhaps we will have to wait, when the rule of law is restored in the European Union, then we will have this money,\" Kaczyński said.\n\nHe also argued that \"in fact, it is not about the funds but about this plan, I will call it the Scholz plan, that simply ... Central Europe would be put under... the foot of Germany.\"\n\nLater on Sunday, Kaczyński said that in the light of von der Leyen's Thursday statement he does not believe that Poland will get recovery funds from the EU now.\n\n\"This is obviously illegal and we will get this money sooner or later. I think that just after winning the elections. Now I do not think we can get this money because making further concessions does not make any sense anymore,\" he said.\n\nKaczyński did not rule out legal steps against the EC as regards the lack of payment of money from the KPO.\n\n\"We have undertaken the projects planned in the KPO. Since we have an approved plan, they should pay us. Perhaps we will sue them for this money,\" he said.\n\nThe European Commission (EC) approved Poland's KPO in early June, opening the way for Warsaw to get EUR 23.9 billion in grants and EUR 11.5 billion in cheap loans. But the EC has long been at loggerheads with Poland's ruling Law and Justice party and froze Warsaw's access to the funds until it meets several rule-of-law milestones.\n\nIn May, Poland adopted new legislation abolishing a disciplinary chamber for judges at the Polish Supreme Court, which has been at the heart of the dispute between Brussels and Warsaw. In July, a new body was set up at the Supreme Court called the Chamber of Professional Responsibility, whose judges are appointed by the president. But Brussels would like to see further steps taken including the reinstatement of judges removed from adjudication by the contested disciplinary chamber. The EC is also concerned that the new chamber may be just another \"politically controlled\" institution, similar to the body liquidated in May.",
    "Agent behind James Bond spy Vesper Lynd given new role in UK-Poland relations": "The real-life model for Vesper Lynd, the alluring spy who so entranced James Bond in Casino Royale, has a new mission. Secret agent Krystyna Skarbek, who was fictionalised as 007’s lover in Ian Fleming’s novel, is now to be the figurehead of a campaign to remind Britain of its strong cultural ties with Poland.\n\nSkarbek, who was Winston Churchill’s favourite secret agent, received the George Medal for her second world war bravery and went under the name Christine Granville in Britain. Courageous and daring, her under-recognised legacy is now to spearhead a fresh mission, officially announced next week.\n\nThe Granville-Skarbek Anglo-Polish cultural exchange will begin as an online museum and research site, run in tandem with a series of public events and exhibitions. After that, a move into a permanent physical home at the Polish Social and Cultural Association (Posk) in west London is planned.\n\n“Skarbek was a Polish aristocrat of Jewish descent and not only the first British female agent but the longest serving of any agent,” said Julia Griffin, curator of the new project. “She and her first husband, a Polish diplomat, were in Africa when war broke out. They immediately took a ship to Southampton, and Krystyna was accepted as an SOE [Special Operations Executive] agent.”\n\nEva Green as Vesper Lynd and Daniel Craig as James Bond in Casino Royale, 2006. Photograph: United Artists/Columbia Pictures/Allstar\n\nFleming, a former naval intelligence officer, had a short romance with Skarbek and was clearly beguiled when they met, telling a mutual friend, “she literally shines with all the splendours of a fictitious character. How rarely one finds such types.” His character Lynd, who was played by Ursula Andress and then Eva Green on screen, battled the villain Le Chiffre and was honoured by Bond in the creation of the Vesper, the famous “shaken not stirred” cocktail.\n\nBut Skarbek’s real-life antics were, if anything, more dazzling. As well as skiing out of occupied Poland with evidence of Nazi plans to invade Russia, she was a crucial contact with resistance operatives, ultimately enabling the liberation of France.\n\n“We know a lot about her now because of her biographer, Clare Mulley,” said Griffin. “Perhaps most famously Skarbek marched alone into Gestapo headquarters and demanded the release of two of Britain’s foremost agents, who were due to be executed. She posed as the niece of General Montgomery and persuaded the German chief to release them.\n\n“She also pioneered the tactic of biting her own tongue when she was captured, using her blood to claim she had TB and prompting her release. This became standard training.”\n\nNext month, a new portrait of Skarbek by acclaimed illustrator Andrzej Klimowski will go on show in an exhibition of his work with his collaborator and wife, Danusia Schejbal, at Posk’s gallery. Other key Polish figures in this portrait series will include Tadeusz Kościuszko, the 18th-century Polish freedom fighter admired by British poets such as Byron, Keats and Coleridge, who also went on to become a cult figure for the Pre-Raphaelite movement.\n\nThe talent of British-Polish author Joseph Conrad will also be celebrated. The young Conrad joined the British merchant navy in 1878, gaining citizenship eight years later. His 1913 novel, Chance, finally earned him notoriety after he had already written The Secret Agent and Heart of Darkness, the work that inspired Francis Ford Coppola’s film Apocalypse Now.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That came in 2004 after Poland joined the EU. Before that came war, communism and religious persecution.”\n\nGriffin, herself a Pole, adds that the impulse behind the new project is positive and not simply aimed at countering “a certain type of narrative or entrenched stereotype” in response to recent Polish immigration to Britain. The second world war will be central to the museum’s narrative, as 5% of the pilots involved in the Battle of Britain were Polish, with 303 (Polish) Fighter Squadron acknowledged as the most successful of any allied squadron.\n\nPerhaps Skarbek’s place at the head of this Anglo-Polish drive is her just reward, since she was unceremoniously dropped from the British secret service and had to take on work as a bathroom steward on passenger liners.\n\nHer relationship with crew member Dennis Muldowney led to her murder in London.

    "Today’s news round up in Poland": "Today’s news round up in Poland Kalbar/TFN\n\nStart your day with a summary of today’s top stories from Poland’s leading news sites.\n\nRz.pl – The newspaper Rzeczpospolita ran a story on Monday on how a lack of access to EU post-pandemic funding could delay investment in railway infrastructure and, as a consequence, result in layoffs by construction firms. Poland has had access to the money blocked owing to a rule-of-law dispute with the EU. The paper citied the problems of PLK, the company which manages Poland's rail infrastructure, which has launched 17 tenders but cannot sign contracts with firms owing to the lack of secure funding.\n\nTVPInfo.pl – Public broadcaster TVP ran a story on the old \"eastern Policy\" of the Polish government under Donald Tusk. TVP quoted Joanna Lichocka, an MP from the governing Law and Justice party, saying that the government under Tusk was one of the \"most pro-Russian\" governments since 1989. She also said that Civic Platform, Tusk's party, along with the Polish People's Party, had strong links with Moscow. The most shocking example of the Russian ties, she claimed, was when the government handed over the investigation into the Smolensk air disaster to Moscow.\n\nWyborcza.pl – The newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza looked at what changes the government might make to the laws governing elections in Poland. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of the governing Law and Justice (PiS) party, said this month that the opposition might rig the next election and therefore the system needed additional protection. But the newspaper said the government's track record on election laws and regulations indicates that any new laws could discriminate against opposition parties. It claimed, for example, that PiS had introduced a number of changes to the State Election Commission, which oversees the party funding of election campaigns, which means the commission is \"no longer protected from political pressure.\"\n\nTVN24.pl – The port city of Gdynia will have no Christmas market or New Year's Eve party this year because of the soaring cost of electricity, the private news network TVN24 reported. The city's government said that, faced with a huge electricity bill, it needed to cut its budget. \"We have to make savings so we decided to focus on expenditures that will not directly affect the level of public services,\" said a local government representative.",
    "Poland ‘hiding’ from spyware inquiry, EU lawmakers warn": "Poland's leading politician Jarosław Kaczyński confirmed the government has the Pegasus hacking software, but the government denied it had been used against opposing politicians | Wojtek Radwanski/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe Polish government on Wednesday faced pressure from EU officials to come clean on how it used spyware for political purposes.\n\nA delegation of members of the European Parliament met with officials of the Polish parliament — the Sejm — and other institutions this week. But the delegation got stonewalled by the government, who declined the committee's invitations to meet.\n\nThe group of EU lawmakers said the government is “hiding behind national security provisions” in its defense of using the Pegasus spyware to surveil opponents in the lead-up to the 2019 election, the head of the delegation and Dutch center-right lawmaker Jeroen Lenaers told reporters at the end of the visit.\n\nThere is no realistic scenario in which “national security requires you to use highly invasive spyware such as Pegasus against opposition politicians, against prosecutors, against lawyers,” Lenaers said.\n\nPoland is one of four countries, together with Hungary, Spain and Greece, where reports on the use of hacking software against political opposition figures, members of civil society and journalists have sparked political crises and investigations — in a series of scandals resembling the Watergate political-espionage scandal that rocked U.S. politics in the 1970s.\n\nPoland's leading politician Jarosław Kaczyński, who chairs the ruling Law and Justice (PiS), previously confirmed the government has the Pegasus hacking software, but the government has denied it had been used against opposition politicians in the 2019 parliamentary election campaign.\n\nLenaers said the government's move to decline meetings with his delegation was “a telling sign of the complete lack of importance this government attaches to checks and balances, to democratic scrutiny and to dialogue with elected representatives.”\n\nThe European Parliament is running an inquiry as part of its special committee investigating the use of the Israeli-made Pegasus software and similar hacking tools by European governments.\n\nThe chamber also wants the European Commission to step in, pressing EU member countries to ensure civil rights and implement privacy protections when using hacking tools as part of investigations and intelligence work.\n\nSophie in 't Veld, a Dutch Liberal lawmaker working on a Parliament report to impose stricter rules, said the European Commission needs “to let go of its ‘none of my business, see no evil, hear no evil’ attitude.”\n\nIn comments to a group of POLITICO reporters on Wednesday, European Justice Commissioner Didier Reyners defended the EU executive's action.

    "Poland to ask Russia to return paintings looted by Red Army in WW2": "Poland will formally ask Russia to return seven paintings from a Moscow museum that were looted by the Red Army during the second world war, the Polish culture minister has announced.\n\nPiotr Gliński said about 20 previous requests to Moscow for the return of thousands of other items stolen during the war had fallen on deaf ears. Those items included archives of the former Nazi death camp at Auschwitz, paintings by Old Masters such as Dürer, Holbein and Cranach and manuscripts by Polish authors.\n\n“Until this day [Russia’s] government has not reviewed any of the claims,” Gliński told a press conference. He added that Russia was the only country among several approached to have failed to respond to Poland on the subject.\n\nPoland’s historically strained ties with Russia hit a new low after Russia’s invasion of neighbouring Ukraine in February. Warsaw, a former satellite of the Soviet Union, supports Kyiv and is pushing for more sanctions against Moscow.\n\nThe latest art request concerns seven paintings by Italian artists that are at the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts in Moscow. They date from the 14th to the 18th century and include Two Saints by Spinello Aretino and Adoration of the Child by Lorenzo di Credi.\n\nBefore the war they were in the collections of the Czartoryski family in Gołuchów, at the Wilanów Palace, and in Poznań, Wrocław and Łódź.\n\nGliński said it was hard to estimate how much of Poland’s art and culture was destroyed or looted by occupying Nazi and Soviet troops during the war, but at the time it was believed Polish museums had lost about half their collections.\n\n“Traces of hundreds of thousands of items lead to the Russian Federation and to the former Soviet republics,” Gliński said. He added that Poland “will never stop searching for … cultural items that were looted” during the war.\n\nSince 2016, Poland has retrieved more than 600 looted cultural artefacts, but none of them from Russia, he said.\n\nAmong them are the paintings Madonna under the Fir Tree by Lucas Cranach the Elder, which had ended up in Switzerland, and Jewish Woman Selling Oranges by Polish 19th century painter Aleksander Gierymski, which was returned from Germany.",
    "After moving to cut Hungary’s funds, EU is “analysing Poland”, which has “many problems”": "After the European Commission moved to suspend billions of euros in EU funds for Hungary, a vice-president said that they also see “many problems” in Poland and are “analysing” further steps towards the country. Poland’s prime minister, meanwhile, has pledged that his government will “strongly oppose” penalising Hungary.\n\nAt a meeting yesterday morning, commissioners recommended suspending €7.5 billion of Hungary’s funds. It is the first time they have called for use of the so-called “conditionality mechanism“, introduced in 2020, which ties the disbursement of the EU budget to rule-of-law standards.\n\nThe European Commission proposed suspending €7.5 billion of funds allocated to #Hungary over rule-of-law concerns, but…also laid the ground for a possible compromise that would allow PM Orbán to keep the money. https://t.co/lDodxd02CD — Saskia Dekkers (@saskiadekkers) September 18, 2022\n\nThe decision now passes to the EU’s individual member states, with the approval of a qualified majority among them required in order to implement the cut to Hungary’s funds. Budapest can also prevent that from happening by meeting 17 commitments it has agreed with the commission.\n\nAfter Sunday’s announcement, Polish Prime MInister Mateusz Morawiecki said it is “obvious” that “Poland will strongly oppose any actions of European institutions that intend to illegally deprive any member states of funds, in this case Hungary”, reports the Polish Press Agency (PAP).\n\nJanusz Kowalski, a deputy minister in the Polish government, warned in a tweet that, after Hungary, Poland could be the next target for “the illegal deprivation of funds” as “eurocrats break the spines of sovereign states that say NO to the federalisation of the EU”.\n\nDziś Węgry, jutro Polska.

The event was organized by the Polish Alternative Fuels Association (PSPA) and hosted a record number of 1598 participants, becoming the largest-scale trade event on sustainable mobility in Poland. It effectively brought together all relevant players in the Polish mobility sector, including the automotive industry, transport companies, providers of mobility services, companies developing electromobility and policymakers from the public sector. The Netherlands’ ambassador to Poland, Daphne Bergsma, officially opened the congress, together with other dignatories, among which the mayor of Łódż, Hanna Zdanowska.\n\nDutch footprint\n\nSeizing the occasion of the NMC, the Netherlands Embassy in Poland decided to offer an \"Exhibition Participation Package\" for the Dutch private sector, under the Support for International Business Programme of the RVO, the aim being to introduce or position Dutch business in the fastly growing Polish mobility sector. The group of company representatives from the Netherlands that applied for the package turned out to be very diverse in background, scale, branch, interest and experience in Poland, resulting in serendipitous exchanges and a remarkably good vibe. We had small and large companies on board, involved in charging infrastructure (Alfen, Fastned, Volt Time, CV Charging Europe), smart energy and mobility solutions (Brenergie, LastMileSolutions), lease (Leaseplan), automotive (DAF Trucks), energy storage (e-ATEPS, StoragePartners), IT-solutions (Sourceful) and a venture capital fund (Urban Impact Ventures).\n\nActivities and visibility\n\nA total of 73 match-making meetings were held, with the invaluable suppport of Elro van den Burg of the Netherlands Polish Chamber of Commerce (NPCC). An other meet&greet-moment was the networking event hosted by the Embassy. Just before the congress, PSPA recorded a podcast in which a number of the Dutch companies presented themselves and the Economic Counsellor of the Netherlands Embassy, Sanne Kaasjager, reflected on developments and opportunities in Polish mobility. A special market survey “Poland Drives e-Mobility 2022”, commissioned by RVO and written by PSPA, provided the basis for that reflection and was also officially presented at the NMC2022. Many of the Dutch business representatives took active part in various panels. Michiel Langezaal, CEO of FastNed, made a keynote speech in the main hall. Herman Sips, representative of the Dutch ministry of Infrastructure and Water, responsible for the campaign to promote the Global MoU on electrification of heavy transport, contributed online in a highly interesting panel with representatives of leading e-truck manufacturers. The centrally-located NL Pavilion did its work by providing a “poster” for the Dutch brands and a lively meeting point. Visitors could also put on special Virtual Reality glasses with 3D-presentations of various Dutch sectors. A total of 54 people seized this new way of visualizing Dutch products and services way of doing business (and sometimes a little seasick). The abundantly present Polish media conducted 6 TV interviews with business and embassy representatives, increasing the Dutch visibility even more.\n\nOpportunities and potential areas for Dutch-Polish cooperation\n\nSo, what are the most potential areas for cooperation and growth? The analists of PSPA concluded that for Dutch investors and providers there are four areas to look at with particular interest: electrification of heavy transport, expansion of a public and private charging infrastructure, lithium-ion battery production and mobility-as-a-service. All Dutch participants where positively surprised by the potential of the Polish market and indicated a clear interest to come back next year. The Netherlands Embassy thanks all involved, especially the NPCC, RVO, the ministry of Infrastructure & Water, and especially the representatives of the Dutch companies for their interest and enthousiastic contributions.",
    "MP: Belarus does not demand any indemnity from Poland": "MINSK, 26 September (BelTA) – Belarus does not demand that Poland should reimburse the damage it caused, though Belarus has indisputable evidence proving the damange, member of the House of Representatives of the National Assembly of Belarus Sergei Klishevich told a BelTA correspondent.\n\n“If you look at the history of our relations with the Polish state, you will see that Poland caused material and non-material damage to our people, our territories. This happened not only in the 1920s-1930s but in other historical periods as well. Yet, now we are talking about the 1920s and the 1930s. And the president was right when he said that today we do not demand any indemnity from anyone for the damage Belarus suffered. We know that not only the Poles, but also the French, other states sent their troops into the territory of Belarus, tormented our people and hampered our spiritual, scientific, technical, industrial development. At the same time, today our so-called partners (although one can hardly call them this way) must understand that if there are such encroachments and threats against us - we can also calculate the damage they caused. Moreover, some historians have already done this,” Sergei Klishevich said.\n\nAll these facts do not require proof, the MP noted. “We have no doubts, and historians, no matter what political views they stick to, do not even have any disputes about the fact that during the occupation of our territory in the 1920s and the 1930s the Polish leadership deliberately hampered our development, turned us into an agricultural backyard of the Polish state and a market for its goods. This has been proven by massive evidence that was documented. These documents are kept, among other things, in our archives. We must closely study this issue, and, if necessary, make it a point in our diplomatic, economic and political relations with Poland,” he stressed. “But I am sure that it won't come to that for the simple reason that elections will be held in Poland very soon. I am sure that sensible politicians who enjoy the real support of the Polish people will come to power, and there will be no such crazy ideas as demanding something from Belarus or other states,” he said.\n\n“Today, our task as historians is to know these facts, establish where and what damage was caused by the Polish regime. And our opponents must understand that, if necessary, we can also raise these issues with the political leadership of Poland, if it keeps acting in the same way, not to mention territorial issues that are also on the agenda of the historical community and are discussed in professional circles. Yet, I do not want to delve into these issues now because Belarusians want to live peacefully together and look to the future, and not constantly take out stones from the past and throw them at each other,” the parliamentarian explained.\n\nWe respect the historical and political choice of Poland and ask for the same attitude towards us, Sergei Klishevich stated. “Yet, if they treat us like a non-state that has not yet been formed, according to some Polish leaders, we can present evidence that proves the violation of all laws, norms and rules to the Polish political leadership in order to demand compensation,” he added, “Indeed, the policy that Poland implemented in the 1920s-1930s held our state back, and quite a lot of effort was invested to help Western Belarus catch up with the BSSR in terms of cultural, industrial, and social development. Therefore, this evidence is indisputable. But again, I repeat, we, unlike the Polish state, act decently. And we demand the same respectful attitude to our choice and our history,” the MP said.",

    "Ambassador Mark Brzezinski’s Remarks about “The Role of Poland in NATO Eastern Flank Security”": "Hotel Bellotto\n\n20 September 2022\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you Deputy Marshall Włodzimierz Czarzasty for proposing this event and inviting me. And thank you to the Bronislaw Komorowski Institute and the Amicus Europae Foundation for organizing.\n\nIt’s an honor to be with you, standing alongside the founding fathers of Poland’s NATO membership.\n\nPresident Kwasniewski, President Komorowski, Ambassador Koźmiński, it is you that we are celebrating on this occasion. Poland is safe and has become an integral part of our shared security, because you knew the value of joining the most powerful collective defense organization in history.\n\nStatesmen, diplomats, and esteemed members of the audience, all of you played a role and still to do to this day. The solemn obligation NATO members make when they join the alliance doesn’t just end when you’re admitted. It takes constant work and requires great sacrifice.\n\nPresident Biden knew that Poland was up for this pledge. As a Senator he led the fight for Poland’s admission into NATO. Former United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright did too.\n\nHer crowning diplomatic achievement was helping to bring Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary into NATO. Secretary Albright passed away a few months ago. But her legacy lives on through the alliance that she modernized and expanded.\n\nWhen Poland joined NATO over two decades ago, the challenges we faced were different. NATO has had to evolve to meet the threats of the 21st century. It’s been Poland on the frontline of these changes.\n\nIn 2016, during NATO’s Warsaw Summit, member countries responded to Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea by deploying four multinational combat battalions to Poland and the three Baltic States. This represented a shift from ‘assurance’ to ‘deterrence and defense’ and some of the largest NATO deployments since the end of the Cold War.\n\nAnd when Russia began its brutal, full-scale further assault on Ukraine in February, Poland, the US, and individual member countries immediately responded by providing support that has fueled Ukraine’s latest push back against Russian forces.\n\nLast week, Ukrainians retook more than six-thousand square kilometers from Russian control in September. Putin’s plan is failing.\n\nWhile we have done so much to support Ukraine, it’s Poland that has truly risen to the moment. Poland’s rapid mobilization has inspired the world.\n\nWhat Poland and its people have done is akin to America’s response to the attack on Pearl Harbor or the Cold War era-space race. It’s reminiscent of the unstoppable spirit of brave Poles during the Warsaw Uprising and the Solidarity movement.\n\nWhen millions of people crossed the Polish borders, you welcomed refugees with open arms. You provided hope and stability for Ukrainian families who had lost everything.\n\nThis is a very important point so I want to convey it in Polish language:\n\nPolska ma wiele mocnych stron.\n\nPolska ma silną gospodarkę.\n\nPolska ma potencjał innowacyjności.\n\nTeraz zobaczyliśmy jeszcze: zdolność do szybkiej reakcji całego społeczeństwa i mobilizacji.\n\nTo znaczy: czasami kryzys może opóźnić reakcję.\n\nAle nie w Polsce. Tutaj w lutym mogliśmy zobaczyć zdolność do szybkiej mobilizacji całego społeczeństwa.\n\nAmeryka miała podobne doświadczenia:\n\nAtak na Pearl Harbor zmobilizował Amerykanów do szybkiego działania w przemyśle wojskowym.\n\nDrugi przykład, to: Lot na Księżyc w 1969 r. spowodował ogromny rozwój technologiczny.\n\nKryzys na Ukraine spowodował ogromną mobilizację w Polsce.\n\nTo daje nadzieję na głębokie zmiany.\n\nAnd it’s Poland that continues to help the United States and our allies and partners in getting Ukraine the supplies it needs.\n\nPoland has also sent $1.8 billion in military aid to Ukraine. You donated many tanks. You sent artillery and ammunition.\n\nPoland has become a military, economic, and humanitarian hub for Ukraine.\n\nAt the same time Poland has been busy shoring up its defense modernization program at lighting fast speed. Billions of dollars are being deployed to purchase trusted U.S. military equipment, Abrams tanks, Patriots, HIMARS, F-35s, and the latest announcement – nearly 100 Apache Helicopters.\n\nIf Russian tanks threaten an inch of NATO territory, those Apache helicopters will stop them in their tracks. Apache helicopters are an armored vehicles worst nightmare. They are tank killers.\n\nThis equipment ensures U.S., Polish, and NATO troops can mesh and train together. It allows our soldiers to work as one.\n\nFurthering that cooperation is the establishment of a permanent U.S. Forward Command Headquarters in Poznan, now appropriately named “Camp Kosciuszko”. A first for the United States in Poland. A first for us in Central Europe.\n\nThis is permanent: it’s a historic tectonic shift. V Corps will coordinate all our land forces in Europe, bringing together any and all capabilities necessary to defend Poland and our NATO Allies.\n\nAdditionally, at the NATO Summit in Madrid, President Biden announced more commitments to bolster European security. This includes the establishment of a support Army garrison headquarters in Poznan, along with a field support battalion in Powidz which will maintain U.S. Armored Brigade Combat Team’s worth of equipment. All here on Polish land on a permanent basis.\n\nAnd that’s not all. Together we are building more than 100 military infrastructure projects in Poland. These support U.S. troops rotating through Poland, provide additional locations to hold joint training exercises, and allow the United States and NATO to even more quickly flow forces to Poland in the event of a crisis.\n\nPoland also showed great foresight working to secure its energy security. The United States stands ready to be a secure supplier of civilian nuclear energy. By selecting U.S. technology, Poland would make another key strategic decision to safeguard its energy security for the century ahead.\n\nI tell you all of this because of the message it sends – that we are together and ready for anything. When it comes to helping Ukraine defend itself, when it comes to making sure that there’s significant pressure on Russia to end this aggression, we are united. It’s our greatest strength.\n\nAnd the anchor for it all – those NATO accession talks twenty-five years ago.\n\nI lived here before Poland was a member of NATO. In the early 1990’s, I was a Fulbright scholar in Warsaw. I remember how things felt back then, the uneasiness. That has changed. Poland is a case study for the benefits of NATO expansion.\n\nPoland is not anxious or nervous. Poland is confident and secure because of NATO. Because we stand together. An attack on one is an attack on us all. Quite simply we have each other’s backs.\n\nAnd now Finland and Sweden will have the same reassurances. I lived in Stockholm for four years, where I had the honor to serve as U.S. Ambassador to Sweden. What an historic shift! The fact that two traditionally non-aligned countries have made the decision to join NATO speaks to the power of collective defense.\n\nIn an almost unanimous vote, the Polish Sejm has backed NATO enlargement to include Finland and Sweden. The United States Senate also overwhelmingly approved Finland and Sweden’s accession into NATO. Bipartisan support, in a day when disagreement and differences can be found at every turn in politics, shows that NATO is something we can all agree on.\n\nAnd just think – Putin thought he would divide us, instead, we have never been more united. NATO is the cornerstone of it all. This brings to life the words President Harry Truman shared in 1949 when the organization was founded. He hoped that NATO “would create a shield against aggression.” And it has. Because for NATO success is gauged not by wars won but by wars that are prevented and stifled.\n\nI can confidently say that in the twenty-two years that Poland has been a full member you have met your obligations and some. It’s no longer about Poland proving it belongs in NATO instead it’s that NATO wouldn’t be what it is without you.\n\nNATO and Poland need each other. The United States of America and Poland need each other. I am working hard every day to ensure that we stay ever closer together.\n\nThank you.",
    "'Moral duty': Poland asks Germany to pay $1.9 trillion in World War Two reparations": "Poland on Thursday estimated the financial cost of World War Two losses to be A$1.9 trillion and said it would \"ask Germany to negotiate these reparations\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is a major sum of 6.2 trillion\" Polish zloty, said Jaroslaw Kaczynski, head of the ruling Law and Justice party and widely considered to be Poland's de facto leader.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of this sum \"is compensation for the deaths of more than 5.2 million Polish citizens,\" he stressed.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Kaczynski said that receiving reparations would be a \"long and difficult\" process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is a decision we will implement,\" he said, speaking on the anniversary of Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland on 1 September, 1939.\n\n\n\nMr Kaczynski was speaking at a conference dedicated to the presentation of a report on Poland's losses in the 1939-1945 war.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince coming to power in 2015, Poland's governing Law and Justice (PiS) party has often championed the issue of war reparations.\n\n\n\n\n\nWork on the reparations report started in 2017, when the conservative government insisted that Germany had a \"moral duty\" in the matter.\n\n\n\nGerman position 'unchanged'\n\nGermany has often rejected Poland's claims, pointing to a 1953 decision by Poland to renounce claims against East Germany.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe German government on Thursday turned down the Polish call to negotiate on reparations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The German government's position is unchanged, the reparations issue is closed,\" a foreign ministry spokesman said in an email to news agency AFP.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe cited the 1953 decision, calling it a \"significant foundation for Europe's order today\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe liberal Polish opposition believes the report is mainly intended for domestic political purposes, coming as it does a year ahead of parliamentary elections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The PiS initiative on war reparations has been appearing for several years, whenever PiS needs to build a political narrative,\" said Donald Tusk, chairman of the main opposition Civic Platform (PO).\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is not about any reparations from Germany, but a political campaign\" in Poland, he added, with Kaczynski seeking to \"rebuild the support of the ruling party through this anti-German campaign\".\n\n\n\nPoland's main ruling party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski attended a wreath-laying ceremony marking national observances of the anniversary of World War Two in Warsaw.

    "Refugees from Ukraine in Poland - Profiling Update, July 2022 - Poland": "INTRODUCTION\n\nMore than 7.1 million refugees from Ukraine have been recorded across Europe. Close to 1.4 million individuals registered for Temporary Protection in Poland as of 12 September 2022, the highest number among the EU countries.\n\nTo understand the demographics of the Ukrainian refugee population, their intentions, immediate needs, access to information and their displacement patterns, UNHCR, in partnership with REACH, launched a region-wide profiling exercise. Interviews were carried out in multiple locations, including border areas, transit and reception centres, collective sites and information and assistance points. While the interviews were conducted in selected locations (i.e. NGO information offices, train and bus stations, reception and transit centers), the results cannot be extrapolated to the population of all refugees from Ukraine residing in Poland and the findings remain indicative. Respondents were randomly selected and asked for their consent to participate in structured interviews using a harmonized regional questionnaire. This update presents results from 3,854 interviews conducted with refugees currently residing in Poland and includes cumulative responses from 1 to 31 July 2022. The approach employed enables for a month to month comparison.\n\nKEY HIGHLIGHTS\n\nAs in June (see here), most of the July respondents plan to stay in Poland. This - together with expected influx of new refugees in the coming months - poses special challenges to Polish institutions and humanitarian actors.",
    "“Poland will either be Christian or it won’t exist,” says education minister": "Poland must remain Christian or it will not exist at all, says the country’s education minister, Przemysław Czarnek. His remarks follow recent comments in which Czarnek called for Poland to lead a “counter-revolution” against the “putrid, anti-religious activities” of the West.\n\nThe minister, known as an ultraconservative figure in Poland’s right-wing government, attended the 10th “Pilgrimage of Men” on Saturday. He told participants that it is “up to us whether we will transfer our Christian heritage to future generations”, reports the Polish Press Agency (PAP).\n\n“This is our responsibility, our duty,” he declared. “We are the sum of our whole Christian heritage, over a thousand years…Poland will either be Christian or it will not exist.”\n\nCiting a sermon by former Polish Pope John Paul II, Czarnek warned that “man cannot be understood without Christ and man is unable to understand himself without Christ. He is not able to say who he is, what his goal in life is, without Christ”.\n\n“Every misfortune in the world results from the fact that someone does not follow one or another of God’s commandments,” the education minister continued, adding that, if everyone obeyed those commandments, there would be no misfortune in the world.\n\nLikewise, one cannot understand Polishness without Christianity. “Those who today not only throw off Christian values, but fight against them, are trying to forcefully throw out the key to understanding Polishness,” he declared.\n\nAnd it is this, he continued, that has contributed to Poland’s survival as “a great, strong nation between Russia and Germany…If there were only those among us who cut off – who sawed off – Christianity, we would probably be speaking Russian or German today”.\n\nThose remarks referenced a comment by a politician from the opposition Civic Platform (PO) party last year, who called for the “sawing off” of “Catholic privileges”. In response, Czarnek warned at the time that “one of PO’s main goals is to de-Christianise Poland following the example of what is happening in the West”.\n\nThe education minister expounded further on that theme at a conference in Warsaw last week on religious freedom. “If we do not want to be the West – in the cultural sense of this putrid, anti-religious activity – then we must be counter-revolutionaries,” he declared.\n\n“We must realise that we are on the front line of a culture war…a brutal revolution,” said Czarnek. “Everything related to Christianity, Catholicism, religion as such, is ridiculed and spat upon.”\n\nThat is why, said the education minister in his remarks this weekend, the teaching of history is so important, to ensure that Poland’s Christian heritage is transmitted to future generations.\n\nPoland’s adoption of Christianity is generally dated to the year 966, when the country’s first ruler, Mieszko I, was baptised. Today it has one of Europe’s highest levels of religiosity, with around 84% of the population identifying as believers (the vast majority Catholics) and 42% practising their faith at least once a week.\n\nChristianity has been closely intertwined with the country’s history and identity, including Poles’ resistance to foreign occupations in the 19th and 20th centuries and to Soviet-imposed communism after World War Two.\n\nHowever, recent years have also seen a gradual weakening of religious faith, and the Catholic church has been hit by child sex abuse scandals and accusations of political interference.\n\nIts position has been strongly defended by the ruling national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, whose leader, Jarosław Kaczyński, has warned that the church is the “repository of the only moral system commonly known in Poland” and that “rejection of it is nihilism”.\n\nMain image credit: Jakub Orzechowski / Agencja Gazeta",
    "Poland to open unfinished waterway in bid to sideline Russia": "A new channel connecting the Vistula Lagoon with the Gulf of Gdańsk is to be launched on Saturday (17 September), even though it is currently unfinished.\n\nThe Vistula Spit canal is to be opened on the anniversary of the Soviet attack on Poland in 1939, which the government will be willing to use as a symbol of the country giving up its dependence on Russia.\n\nWith the canal launch, Poland will break with Russia’s domination in the region, the Polish government insists. Ships will get access to all ports of the Vistula Lagoon, and the seaport in Elbląg, and new development opportunities will open up for Elbląg, Warmia and the whole of Eastern Poland.\n\n“Thanks to the Vistula Spit dug-through, Poland will gain a waterway which connects the Vistula Lagoon with the Baltic Sea and is independent of Russia. The canal will ensure Poland is safe and sovereign,” said the government in a statement, quoted by Money.pl\n\nWhile experts warn that opening an unfinished waterway poses a risk to the vessels that will use it, the opening ceremony organisers have long been looking for a captain who “proves brave enough” to cross the canal first, Wirtualna Polska news portal earlier reported.\n\nEventually, a volunteer was found, according to Business Insider Poland. Zodiak II will be the pioneer in the new waterway.\n\n“I hope it will not come through. Such a demonstrational passage comes with a risk of an image disaster if the barge, sailing along an unmarked route, ran aground,” Daniel Kotur, a captain with 20 years of experience, told Wirtualna Polska.\n\nThe total length of the waterway from the Gulf of Gdańsk through the Vistula Lagoon to Elbląg is almost 23 km. The canal and the entire fairway will be 5 m deep.",
    "Carlsberg maintains Poland output despite CO2 concerns": "Carlsberg sign in Kraków, Poland, January 2022 (Image credit: brunocoelho // Shutterstock.com)\n\nCarlsberg has yet to reduce its production in Poland despite pressure on CO2 supplies in the country, Just Drinks understands.\n\nLast week, Polish fertiliser suppliers Anwil and Grupa Azoty announced cuts in output amid soaring gas prices in Europe.\n\nCO2 is a by-product of fertiliser production and there had been concerns at Carlsberg about the supply of the gas to its brewing operations in Poland.\n\nHowever, Anwil said yesterday (29 August) it had restarted production of fertilisers, citing food security grounds. In a separate statement, Grupa Azoty said yesterday it was continuing “to provide supplies of CO2 to its existing customers”. Anwil had not returned a request for comment at the time of writing, and Grupa Azoty declined to comment further.\n\nOver the weekend, Polish government officials reportedly indicated the administration was working on a package to support fertiliser production.\n\nApproached by Just Drinks today, Carlsberg explained it had not halted production at its breweries in Poland and that no producers of food and beverage should expect to stop production in Poland.\n\nThe group has three production facilities in the country and holds a 19.4% market share, according to its website.\n\nCO2 shortages are a growing concern for companies across the beverage sector in Europe. In July, a number of soft drinks companies in Italy warned of shortages as gas producers cut output in response to rising energy costs.\n\nLast week, UK beverage associations called for Government action following the announcement CF Fertilisers UK plans to halt the production of CO2 at its facility in Billingham due to “uneconomical” conditions.\n\nFDI in beverages in 2021: The state of play",
    "Poland could replace blocked EU funds with loans from Asia, says deputy PM": "If the European Union continues to block billions of euros in funds for Poland as part of its “primitive blackmail” aimed at “forcing a change of government” then Warsaw could seek to replace the money with loans from Asia, says a deputy prime minister.\n\n“We are not responsible for the fact that we have not yet received the funds,” Piotr Gliński told conservative weekly Sieci, referring to around €36 billion in post-pandemic recovery funds for Poland that Brussels has frozen over rule-of-law concerns.\n\n“We have met the conditions, and the money is still blocked,” he added. Warsaw insists it has met the “milestones” agreed with the European Commission to unlock the funds, but Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says that not all the requirements have yet been satisfied.\n\nGliński said that the EU has “deceived us” and that its actions amount to “primitive – no longer disguised – blackmail aimed at forcing a change of government” in Poland, with the money being “blocked for purely political reasons”. Other government figures have made similar accusations in recent weeks.\n\nThe deputy prime minister assured that, even if the European money does not arrive, “we will not abandon the development and investments” that are intended to be funded with it. “Everything written into the National Reconstruction Plan will be implemented regardless.”\n\nGliński noted that the EU’s pandemic recovery programme is being funded by the bloc borrowing money. So, to replace lost funds, Poland could “consider borrowing money elsewhere. Maybe in Asia? If there are possibilities, you have to consider them”, he told Sieci.\n\nThe European Commission notes, however, that by borrowing money on the international markets as a bloc, it is able to secure more favourable rates than most member states could individually.\n\nMain image credit: Michal Osmenda/Wikimedia Commons (under CC BY-SA 2.0)",
    "Nationalism Is Rising in Poland, and It’s Undermining the Market Reforms That Followed the Fall of Communism": "September takes me to Warsaw in Poland and Hanoi in Vietnam, two countries that have far more in common than most people think. They are two countries that suffered terrible wars—in Poland from 1939 to 1945, and in Vietnam from 1955 to 1975. In each case, millions of people were killed and the country was devastated. And after the wars, each had no chance to recover and rebuild their economies because socialist planned economies were established. In these two countries, the planned economy system led to misery, poverty, and soaring inflation. In both countries, the ruling communists first tried reforms in the existing system until people understood that it was only the introduction of private property rights and a market economy that would help their countries. No countries of comparable size have gained as much in the Index of Economic Freedom as Vietnam and Poland in recent decades, and in both countries the lives of ordinary people have improved dramatically.\n\nDaily Life Under Socialism\n\nWhenever I travel to a country, I first look into its history in order to understand it better. That’s why in Poland I started out by meeting Alicja Wancerz-Gluza, co-founder of the Karta Center, a non-governmental historical archive. Alicja initially became active in the Solidarność trade union movement and later – after the declaration of martial law in Poland – joined the anti-communist underground. On January 4, 1982, together with her husband and a small group of friends, she founded the underground newspaper Karta. Over time, the newspaper, which she wrote on a typewriter and then mimeographed, became a publishing house that published illegal newspapers and books.\n\nToday, the Karta archive has 5,000 books and brochures, about 35,000 newspapers, 300 posters and 1,000 postcards from the underground anti-communist movement. The collection also includes the largest collection of documents from the Solidarność trade union. Alicja proudly shows me a document from UNESCO, confirming that this collection was entered into the international register of world document heritage of UNESCO’s “The Memory of the World” program—together with the wooden boards on which the workers who took part in the strike in August 1980 in the Gdansk shipyard wrote down their 21 demands. Karta collected 6,000 interviews with contemporary witnesses (including 1,000 interviews with former prisoners of the Soviet gulags) and about 400,000 photographs.\n\nDuring our conversation, Alicja explains the realities of everyday life in the socialist planned economy in Poland. She shows me the pile of ration cards Polish people needed to buy food and other products until the collapse of the socialist regime in the late 1980s. The first ration cards were for sugar in 1976. But these cards were still around until the end of the 1980s—for all kinds of products, such as meat, fat, butter, detergent, soap, cigarettes, gasoline, and even shoes. There were also so-called replacement coupons on the cards, which had numbers on them. For example, it was suddenly announced that you could buy school supplies for children or sanitary pads for women using card Number 3.\n\nIn the shop, the saleswoman would use scissors to cut small coupons from the cards. And to get such a card, in turn, you needed other cards, on which every month your employer registered all the cards you had been issued. It was a real tragedy when someone lost one of their cards.\n\nAlicja: “It was a truly special occasion when I got a card from the registry office that would allow me to buy white tights for my wedding. I was also given a certificate stating that because we were getting married we were allowed to buy gold wedding rings in a jewelry store. But we didn’t have the money for that, and we didn’t want rings anyway. So, there were special cards for all occasions, for example, for a funeral you could get a card for black pantyhose.”\n\nBut just because you had the cards didn’t mean you could simply go out and buy the product.\n\nFor the children there were cards for powdered milk and sweets (so-called “chocolate substitutes”). To buy furniture, a washing machine or a television, people had to stand in what were known as “kolejkach społecznych” (social queues). Sometimes, they had to come every day for a month or two and stand in line for hours at a time. Family members waited in line and then swapped places with other family members every few hours. Every couple of hours, names were called out – and if someone wasn’t there, they lost their place in the line and the time they had spent waiting was for nothing.\n\nIt was also difficult to get a telephone. “In my neighborhood, in 1986, there was only one phone booth for all of the streets and buildings in the new district,” Alicja explains. “It was a public phone, no one in my neighborhood had a private phone.”\n\nHer parents moved into their cooperative apartment in 1960 and immediately applied for a telephone line. The phone was eventually connected—13 years later in 1973. And that only happened so “quickly” because her father was a member of the Polish United Workers Party. In any case, international calls could only be made at the post office, where people had to book their calls several hours in advance. And it was only because Alicja’s father was in the party that he also got a special voucher for a car, a Fiat 126p. But he still had to wait until 1980 for his vehicle, despite having received the voucher as a reward for becoming First Party Secretary at his factory.\n\nPeople had to wait for everything, including an apartment. Alicja remembers: “When my future husband was 5 years old, his parents started paying money into a cooperative, so that 25 years later they would have the right to buy a small apartment. My parents started saving a little later because they had previously been saving for my sister.” Twenty-five years later, when she was 29 and her husband 30, they were then able to pool their entitlements, acquired over many years of saving, and move into a small three-room apartment, which was nevertheless far from debt-free and still had to be paid off.\n\nRight and Left Doesn’t Mean Much in Poland\n\nToday, Poland is a country with an exceptionally successful economy. But there are also negative developments. Adam Szlakpka, the leader of the liberal Nowoczesna party, is worried about his country. His party cooperates with a number of other parties, including Donald Tusk’s Civil Platform (PO), the Greens and the Inicjatywa Polska party in the Koalicja Obywatelska (Civic Coalition). The terms “left” and “right” have come to have a very different meaning in Poland compared to other Western European countries: Szalpka believes that 80 percent of the 130 deputies in the Koalicja Obywatelska are free-market, while the ruling Prawo i Sprawiedliwość (Law and Justice) party is very etatist. The PiS party is considered right-wing, but the supporters of the market economy I met in Poland regard that party as socialist because it stands for redistribution, nationalization, and bigger government.\n\nThese explanations were important for me, because in a survey on the opinion of market economy and capitalism I commissioned Ipsos MORI to conduct in Poland and 26 other countries, our findings were somewhat strange. In almost every surveyed country, we found that respondents who classified themselves as left-wing were critical of the market economy and capitalism. In contrast, almost everywhere we conducted our survey, respondents who classified themselves as right-wing were more in favor of the market economy and capitalism. In Poland, however, the situation was partly reversed.\n\nAt the time, I remember calling Dr. Thomas Petersen of the Allensbach Institute, who is also my liaison at Ipsos MORI and certainly the best expert on opinion polls in Germany (for a time, he was even chairman of the World Association for Public Opinion Research). I recall telling him: “Well, I have significant doubts about the data from Poland. Overall, they are plausible, but something must have gone wrong with the right-left allocation, perhaps an error in the coding.” Dr. Petersen asked Ipsos MORI to meticulously check everything—the translation of the questionnaire, the coding, etc.—but there was no doubt: the data were correct.\n\nIf I’m honest, I still didn’t quite believe it. It was only after my conversation with Szlapka that I felt more reassured: “What applies in Western Europe absolutely does not apply here. In our country, the former communists are more free-market than the PiS party, which Germans would classify as right-wing,” he said. The PiS party, he explains, combines nationalism with anti-capitalism and has been particularly successful with voters by claiming that the privatization of state-owned enterprises is a sellout to foreign capitalists.\n\nPiS has radically stopped and even reversed a number of privatizations, some of which were previously carried out by the “left.” For someone from Germany, who considers leftists as anti-capitalists and (moderate) rightists as pro-capitalists, this can be confusing at first. Yes, sometimes you first have to go to the country where a survey was conducted in order to properly understand its results.\n\nThe next day, I met Tomasz Wroblewski from the Warsaw Enterprise Institute, which promotes the market economy and especially small and medium-sized enterprises in Poland. He takes a very critical view of the EU: in the beginning, he says, it played a positive role for Poland, but it is now moving more and more in the direction of state interventionism and restricting economic freedom.\n\nPoland Welcomes Refugees From Belarus With Open Arms\n\nPoland is often criticized by other countries for its refugee policy. However, Poland has not only welcomed a great many war refugees from Ukraine with open arms, it has also accepted refugees from Belarus. Looking at the total number of applications for residence in Poland as well as temporary work permits, Belarusians have been the second largest migrant group in Poland after Ukrainians since 2019.\n\nI met six entrepreneurs from Belarus who fled the country after dictator Lukashenko rigged the August 2020 presidential election, a move that sparked a wave of mass protest. More than 33,000 people were arrested and more than 250 injured in the daily protests. Alexey was a top manager for several companies in Minsk before he joined the protests and led a group of 4,500 opposition members in the Belarusian capital. It was clear that he too would have been jailed if he had not fled. In Poland, he founded an organization that supports the families of political prisoners in Belarus and refugees from the country. With his business savvy and his excellent language skills, he has no doubts that he will also be successful professionally in Poland in the future.\n\nEven before the events of 2020, Serg had repeatedly considered emigrating, but the brutal suppression of the mass protests tipped the scales and he too emigrated to Poland. He cannot understand anyone who still wants to live in the country where Lukashenko rules. Serg was a top manager in Minsk for 20 years and today he has a project in Warsaw to finance start-ups. Before moving to Poland, he lived in Denmark.\n\n“In Copenhagen, I met a lot of happy people with a smile on their lips,” he says. “I also met a lot more happy and friendly people in Poland than in Belarus, although not as many as in Denmark. In Belarus you see many sad and bitter people and very little laughter.”\n\nIncidentally, his subjective impression is in line with the World Happiness Index, which happiness researchers compile on the basis of surveys. Denmark is in second place, Poland in 48th place – and there are no data whatsoever for Belarus.\n\nMikhail is an alarm and security systems specialist. He emigrated from Belarus to Poland in November 2021. He wants to build his successful company here before expanding to other European countries, such as Italy. He is optimistic because Poles, he says, are fond of Belarusians and appreciate their fast work. But many Polish companies are a bit slow, he says, and he hopes to make speed one of his USPs (Unique Selling Propositions)—and the need for security systems is huge everywhere, including Poland.\n\nI used to think that many Poles do not like the Russians for historical reasons. After all, they—like the Germans—have repeatedly invaded and divided the country. Today, however, I learned that Poles make a very clear distinction between Russians and Belarusians. Belarusians, everyone tells me, are held in high esteem in Poland. People in both countries feel connected by history, and unlike with many other neighbors, Poland has never been at war with Belarus. Today’s Belarus was part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Belarusians and Poles fought against Moscow during the January Uprising (1863-1864) and in the Polish-Bolshevik War (1919-21).\n\nBalcerowicz, the Great Reformer\n\nOn the last day of my stay in Poland, I met the legendary Leszek Balcerowicz, the man to whom Poland most owes its economic success. He was twice finance minister and later head of the central bank, first fought inflation and stabilized the country economically, and then introduced the free-market reforms that allowed Poland to become one of the most economically successful countries in the world in recent decades.\n\nProbably the most important insight Balcerowicz had, and the reason for the success of his reform program, was that step-by-step reforms would not help Poland overcome the problems it was facing. Only rapid, comprehensive and radical reforms in all areas could change things for the better. Balcerowicz, unlike many other economists, also possessed a finely tuned political intuition that told him: in this troubled situation, there is only a very short window of opportunity for reforms. He knew that he must either use this window of opportunity with decisive, rapid reform measures, or hesitate, and accept that it would then become more difficult or impossible to implement the reforms.\n\nBalcerowicz is ten years older than me—he’s 75—but just as active. He is the founder and Chairman of the Council of FOR, Civil Development Forum, which promotes a market economy. Balcerowicz is worried about the future of his country. Instead of continuing the reforms he initiated, the PiS party, which has been in power since 2015, is pursuing policies that, he tells me, are more etatist than those of any other government since the end of socialism in Poland. The reforms that were implemented then are now criticized, with nationalists tarnishing privatization as a sellout to the Americans or Germans, and painting a distorted picture of Polish history.\n\nThe blame for the problems Poland experienced in the 1990s was allegedly not the communists, who had run the country into the ground, but the reforms. Yet, Balcerowicz notes, people in the 1990s did understand how important the reforms were and how much their situation improved as a result. Otherwise, he would not have won the 1997 elections with his party in Silesia, Poland’s most industrialized region.\n\nDuring our conversation, I realized what I had already noticed when reading his books: he is not a typical theoretical economist. In fact, at one point he tells me that a theoretical economist is a contradiction in terms, since economists have to deal with reality. This reminded me a little of Marx’s well-known saying that “Philosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways. The point, however, is to change it.”\n\nBalcerowicz changed Poland just as Margaret Thatcher changed Great Britain. For me, he is one of the greatest economic reformers of the twentieth century. I hope the people of Poland don’t forget that it was more market—and not more state—that made them so successful.",

    "Polish opposition wants war reparations from Russia as well as Germany": "Poland’s largest opposition group has responded to the government’s plans to seek war reparations from Germany by calling for it to also pursue them from Russia as the successor to the Soviet Union, which invaded Poland along with Nazi Germany in 1939.\n\n“If we are talking about the settlement of war grievances and damages, we must talk about those who led to the outbreak of World War Two, that is fascist Germany and the communist Soviet Union,” said Borys Budka, head of the parliamentary caucus of the centrist Civic Coalition (KO).\n\nHe noted that, under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, Berlin and Moscow agreed to divide up Poland between them, a plan that was put into action when Germany invaded from the west on 1 September 1939 and the Soviet Union from the east on 17 September.\n\n“That is why we want to mention Russia as an entity responsible for the Second World War in this reparations resolution, with all its consequences,” Budka told the Polish Press Agency (PAP).\n\nAs a result of Soviet occupation, at least tens of thousands of Polish citizens were killed – including 22,000 military officers and intelligentsia during the Katyn massacres – while hundreds of thousands were imprisoned or deported to Siberia.\n\nWith a new session of parliament starting today, KO intends to submit a resolution calling for reparations from both Germany and Russia. If that is not accepted, it will seek to add amendments to that effect to a resolution by the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party calling for reparations from Germany.\n\nKO’s resolution, the text of which has been published by Dziennik Gazeta Prawna, calls for Germany and Russia “to unequivocally accept political, historical, legal and financial responsibility for the consequences of…the unleashing of the Second World War by the Third German Reich and the USSR”.\n\nIt notes that “the then allied Germany and USSR” oversaw “occupation, systematic genocide and mass deportations of Polish citizens”, including “the Katyn massacre, which had the character of genocide”.\n\n“Poland has never received compensation for the enormity of harm caused to Polish citizens by the Third German Reich and the USSR,” it concludes.\n\n\"Sprawa reparacji była pułapką, zastawioną przez PiS\". Posłom KO udało się z niej zręcznie wydostać? https://t.co/4k3wQ6XdaX — Dziennik.pl (@DziennikPL) September 14, 2022\n\nThe issue was sparked on 1 September when senior PiS figures – including party chairman Jarosław Kaczyński and Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki – announced that Poland would be seeking reparations from Germany for war damages calculated to be worth $1.3 trillion.\n\nIn response, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has reiterated Berlin’s longstanding position that the issue of reparations was legally settled long ago, with Poland having renounced its right to compensation in the 1950s and later governments confirming that decision.\n\nThe Polish government, however, intends to press ahead with its claim. Morawiecki has announced that he will “soon” pass a diplomatic note to Germany on the issue, and Warsaw is hoping that will then open negotiations.\n\nWhile PiS has repeatedly called for reparations from Germany, in 2020 Kaczyński said that Russia “should also pay” for the damage caused by the Soviet invasion and occupation.\n\nIn response to those remarks, Russia’s ambassador to Warsaw claimed that in fact Poland “has an unpaid debt to Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union” for “liberating” them from Nazi Germany.\n\nUnder the official Russian historical narrative promoted by Vladimir Putin, the Soviet Union did not invade Poland in 1939. Russian state entities have also sought to deny or downplay Soviet crimes against Poles such as the Katyn massacres.\n\nMain image credit: TASS/Wikimedia Commons (under public domain)",

    "Wales 0-1 Poland: Nations League – as it happened": "24h ago 16.55 Reuters take on that Croatia win in Austria. Croatia qualified for the Nations League semi-finals next year as defender Dejan Lovren marked his return to the team with a rare goal in a comprehensive 3-1 victory over relegated Austria in Vienna. Lovren, playing his first international in almost a year, scored the third goal for the visitors, who topped League A Group 1 with 13 points from six matches, one point ahead of second-placed Denmark. Austria finished bottom. Luka Modric gave Croatia an early lead with his 23rd international goal as he took a touch to control Nikola Vlasic’s pass and fired low into the net. That joy was short-lived as Austria equalised three minutes later when Christoph Baumgartner glanced Marcel Sabitzer’s cross into the net with a deft header. But two goals in three minutes midway through the second period sealed the points for Croatia as Marko Livaja headed home at the back post after a cross from Ivan Perisic, before Lovren was left free by the home defenders to score with a header from Lovro Majer’s cross. Despite the loss, it was a special night for home forward Marko Arnautovic, who won an Austrian record 104th international cap and moved past Andreas Herzog at the top of the country’s list of most appearances.\n\n\n\n24h ago 16.51 Reuters take on the Netherlands, who are on their way to the Nations League final with Croatia. Captain Virgil van Dijk netted a second-half winner as the Netherlands beat neighbours Belgium 1-0 on Sunday to ensure top spot in their Nations League group and a place in next year*s finals tournament. Van Dijk powered home a header from a corner in the 73rd minute at the Amsterdam Arena on Sunday to ensure the Dutch finished runaway winners in League A Group Four. They finished with 16 points, six more than Belgium who had a chance to leapfrog their neighbours, and take first place, but needed to win by three goals or more on Sunday to do so. Any hopes of a goal feast were quickly stymied, however, as the two sides effectively cancelled each other out in a tight tactical battle. The Dutch pressing game frustrated Belgian efforts at building up attacks, while a five-man defence for the visitors meant there was little room for the home strikers.\n\n\n\n24h ago 16.47 Reuters on France’s loss to the Danes. Nations League holders France lost 2-0 to Denmark in their final Group 1 game but salvaged their place in the top tier at the end of a dismal campaign on Sunday. Didier Deschamps’s side, who will face Denmark in Group D at the World Cup in November, conceded first-half goals by Kasper Dolberg and Andreas Skov Olsen to finish third in their Group with five points from six games. Austria were relegated to League B after a 3-1 home defeat in Croatia left them bottom of the group on four points. Croatia qualified for the final four with 13 points, one ahead of Denmark, who burst into life against France after being dominated in the first 20 minutes.\n\n\n\n24h ago 16.43 Full-time scores in the Nations League Austria 1-3 Croatia\n\nDenmark 2-0 France\n\nFaroe Islands 2-1 Turkey\n\nNetherlands 1-0 Belgium\n\nLuxembourg 1-0 Lithuania\n\n\n\n24h ago 16.41 Full-time: Wales 0-1 Poland Not the way Wales would like to sign off ahead of going to Qatar but this was a young, inexperienced team, with Gareth Bale playing only for match fitness, and who failed to make much of a free-kick in the dying embers. Much to admire in the performance of Brennan Johnson, but for now, Wales have been relegated from the elite section of the Nations League. Now for the next 58 days, and Team USA in Doha.\n\n\n\n24h ago 16.39 90+3 min: Wales push on and on, Brennan Johnson in the middle of it. Then Sorba Thomas takes the corner, and that’s cleared. Moore heads down, and there’s a claim for a handball, only for the Moore to be booked for his challenge on Krychowiak.\n\n\n\n24h ago 16.37 90+2 min: Bale heads against the crossbar! This time, Sorba Thomas’ cross is perfect and Bale powers the ball beyond Szczesny and off the bar.\n\n\n\n24h ago 16.35 90 min: There will be five minutes on, and Wales are at least pushing hard.\n\n\n\n24h ago 16.34 88 min: Wales waste a free-kick as Sorba Thomas, usually so good at these moments, especially for Huddersfield, just lumps the ball into the wall.\n\n\n\n1d ago 16.31 86 min: Thomas is now on for Roberts for Wales. Colwill, all bouffant hair and youthful promise, escapes down the left-hand channel. Johnson is waiting in the middle, and he can’t be found. Szczesny has been a safe pair of hands tonight.\n\n\n\n1d ago 16.29 84 min: Score correction: it’s actually Luxembourg 0-0 Lithuania. Must have been a VAR.\n\n\n\n1d ago 16.28 83 min: Poland making a series of subs now as they attempt to further run down the clock.\n\n\n\n1d ago 16.27 82 min: Matt Dony gets in touch: “Bergkamp-esque. Except, Lewandowski meant it. (Tin hat: On)“ Peter Oh: “I’m having a hard time keeping things straight. Tell me if I’ve got it right: England are poor, Scotland are good, and Wales are mediocre.” Alexander McMillan: “Seems to me, it depends on who you think football is for. If you think it’s for the serial winners (big clubs and major nations) then you probably don’t like it. But if you think it’s for everyone, and that all nations deserve the chance to progress and play against opponents of a similar level, then you’ve got to be all for it. Lots of the ‘lower’ standard European sides showing massive improvements.”\n\n\n\n1d ago 16.25 80 min: Wales’ attacks have been rather less than fluid, with the Poles sat deep in numbers, and Bale, somehow still on the field, struggling to impose himself.\n\n\n\n1d ago 16.24 78 min: Scoreflash: Austria 1-3 Croatia, goals from Marko Livaja and Dejan Lovren are good news for France who are now likely to stay up.\n\n\n\n1d ago 16.22 77 min: Szczesny makes a fine save – again – James whipping in the ball from the left, and the Polish goalkeeper dived late to force it away from danger. Kieffer Moore might have been on the crime scene there.\n\n\n\n1d ago 16.21 76 min: Scoreflash: Netherland 1-0 Belgium and Virgil van Dijk got it.\n\n\n\n1d ago 16.20 75 min: It’s getting even more bitty, with Poland running down the clock, they have plenty of experience in their team. Lewandowski buys time off a Cabango foul.\n\n\n\n1d ago 16.17 72 min: On comes Rubin Colwill, and off goes Levitt. That would seem to have left just Joe Morrell as a Wales central midfielder.\n\n\n\n1d ago 16.15 70 min: All huff and puff for Wales, who Poland are keeping at arm’s length here.\n\n\n\n1d ago 16.14 68 min: Bogdan gets in touch: “Tell me honestly what do you really think about this Nations league project, is it good or bad for football? I just don`t know, in some way for me it has improved the international football since there are no meaningless friendlies but, on the other hand, there are more difficult competitive matches and the players get more tired playing not-so-important games?” I am torn, I have to say. I sigh each time the Nations League comes around then enjoy some of the games. So it’s better than friendlies, but then it’s not the Premier League or a major finals. Hmm.\n\n\n\n1d ago 16.12 65 min: Scoreflash: The Faroe Islands are currently leading Turkey 2-0. The only other goal other than Swiderski’s here is that putting Luxembourg 1-0 up on Lithuania.\n\n\n\n1d ago 16.10 64 min: Poland change: off goes Karol Świderski, the goalscorer, and on comes Krzysztof Piątek of Salernitana.\n\n\n\n1d ago 16.08 62 min: Wales staring down the barrel of relegation, and paying for not being able to take their chances and suffering for having Joe Allen and Aaron Ramsey on the bench.\n\n\n\n1d ago 16.06 60 min: Szczesny makes a great save, as Brennan Johnson comes in from the left, and the ball was arrowing in, only for the Juventus goalkeeper to make the save with his fingertips. Good football all round.\n\n\n\n1d ago 16.04 59 min: And as that goal went in, courtesy of a piece of Bergkamp-esque skill from Lewandowski, on comes Moore, and off goes Norrington Davies.\n\n\n\n1d ago 16.03 Goal! Wales 0-1 Poland (Swiderski, 58) That man Lewandowski at the heart of it. Krychowiak’s pass goes to Lewandowski whose flick takes out two Wales defenders and Swiderski smashes home.

Photograph: Michael Zemanek/REX/Shutterstock\n\nUpdated at 16.12 EDT\n\n1d ago 16.01 57 min: James seems to be the furthest man forward, and is having real problems holding it up. Bale surely to go off?\n\n\n\n1d ago 16.00 55 min: Yes, Moore is coming on, after a discussion with Rob Page, who has clearly seen enough.\n\n\n\n1d ago 15.58 53 min: Kieffer Moore is imminent for Wales, and they could really do with a focal point up front. Arwel Jones gets in touch: “Bale looks like an old man lost in the park.” Yes, a little bit.\n\n\n\n1d ago 15.56 51 min: More groans for the officiating as Glik smashes into James, and somehow that’s not given as a foul. It looked a forearm smash.\n\n\n\n1d ago 15.54 48 min: Neco Williams is booked as Bartosz Bereszyński took a smashing, and comes back on the field to roll around. The referee rather awarded that one blind.\n\n\n\n1d ago 15.52 47 min: A slow start to this half, and will we see more of Bale who has a free role as ever.\n\n\n\n1d ago 15.51 46 min: Back underway in Cardiff. with Poland getting it launched to the back stick from the kick-off.\n\n\n\n1d ago 15.37 Half-time scores in the Nations League Austria 1-1 Croatia\n\nDenmark 2-0 France\n\nFaroe Islands 0-0 Turkey\n\nNetherlands 0-0 Belgium\n\nLuxembourg 0-0 Lithuania\n\n\n\n1d ago 15.35 Half-time: Wales 0-0 Poland As it stands, Wales will get relegated from the Nations League top tier. They finish the half with Szczesny making brave save from Gareth Bale, and the two share a handshake as the whistle goes. Dan James had the best chance of the game, and perhaps stopped Brennan Johnson having a better one. Still, an inexperienced Wales team is holding its own.\n\n\n\n1d ago 15.33 45+1 min: Bednarek is not booked when James looked to have escaped at the halfway line. Lucky boy. That’s a yellow in the Barclays. Three minutes added on here.\n\n\n\n1d ago 15.32 45 min: Wales have been a bit better as this half has gone on, without ever throwing much in the way of passing together. Brennan Johnson, who is so lively, is caught offside.\n\n\n\n1d ago 15.29 43 min: Norrington-Davies is booked, having smashed into Lewandowski, who does take his time coming back up. He’s still wiping his brow as he gets up.\n\n\n\n1d ago 15.28 42 min: So close for Wales. Brennan Johnson speeds forward, unleashes a shot and it might well have been going in, only for the ball to come off Dan James and go wide.\n\n\n\n1d ago 15.26 39 min: Almost a horror moment, for Wayne Hennessey, who almost did a Peter Enckelman, a Scott Carson, a David de Gea, from a back-pass from Norrington-Davies, I think – Rodon maybe. Hennessey makes amends by making a save soon after.\n\nUpdated at 15.28 EDT\n\n1d ago 15.24 38 min: Szczesny has to come out and stop Gareth Bale, who had just escaped after a throw-in.

    "British citizens to retain pre-Brexit local voting rights in Poland": "The Polish government has approved a proposed amendment to the electoral law that will allow British citizens living in Poland to retain the same right to vote and stand in local elections that they had before Brexit.\n\nThe bill, which now passes to parliament, adjusts the law to comply with an agreement between Poland and the United Kingdom on reciprocal voting rights for their citizens signed in 2020, during the transition period after the UK left the European Union.\n\nUnder that agreement, British citizens living in Poland are to be entitled to participate in local elections, meaning that they can both vote and stand as candidates. The last nationwide local elections took place in 2018 and the next ones are due next year, though the ruling party is attempting to delay them until 2024.\n\nThe proposed change to the law means that “UK citizens will be able to participate in municipal council elections and in the elections of mayors on the same terms as citizens of EU member states who are not Polish citizens”, says the Polish prime minister’s office.\n\nAs was the case before Brexit, UK citizens will still not be able to vote in Polish parliamentary or presidential elections unless they also have Polish citizenship. They are also no longer eligible to vote in elections for the European Parliament, a right they previously had as EU citizens living in another member state.\n\nThe 2020 reciprocal agreement commits the UK to likewise give voting rights in local elections to Poles living in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The UK has also negotiated voting agreements with Spain, Portugal, and Luxembourg.\n\nAn estimated 6,500 UK citizens live in Poland. Those resident before the end of 2020 benefited from a simplified procedure to allow them to stay after Brexit. As third-country nationals, new arrivals are only allowed to stay for 90 days within a 180-day period without a visa.\n\nThe number of Polish nationals in the UK, which increased rapidly after Poland’s accession to the EU in 2004, peaked at over a million in 2017, but had dropped to under 700,000 by 2021.\n\nMain image credit: Flickr/UK Government (under CC BY-NC-ND 2.0)"
