    "Malaysia reaches out to attract students and partners": "At an event held at the High Commission in London, Education Malaysia Global Services and the high commissioner of Malaysia to the UK appealed to institutional partners to restart sending exchange students to the Southeast Asian nation.\n\nCEO of EMGS, Mohd Radzlan Bin Jalaludin, highlighted that as of August this year, Malaysian authorities had received some 180 new visa applications from UK students.\n\nBetween January 1 and August 31, 2,177 visa applications for mobility had been received in total, with France (388), Indonesia (316), Japan (252) and Germany (205) leading on applications.\n\nOf the UK numbers, Radzlan Bin Jalaludin said they have not yet rebounded to pre-Covid numbers.\n\n“Before Covid, the actual number would be around 280 to 300 new applications from the UK,” he said.\n\nUp to 2019, the number had been rising year-on-year from the UK with 230 applications in 2017, 252 in 2018 and 300 in 2019.\n\n“Our borders are open. Please my friends, come and visit us, any time, any day”\n\n“But during 2021 and 2020, the number was 10 to 12… because most of UK students come to Malaysia for short courses and mobility. So for mobility they need to be in the country,” Radzlan Bin Jalaludin said.\n\n“So now, our borders are open. Please my friends, come and visit us, any time, any day,” he appealed, pointing to the affordability, English-medium courses and lifestyle as attractive reasons to opt for the country as a mobility destination.\n\nEarlier in September, EMGS worked with the Committee for International Directors of Public Universities and Education Malaysia Australia to welcome eight Australian universities to the country.\n\nAustralian university representatives visited campuses and top destinations including Kuala Lumpur, Melaka and Tioman Island.

You know, it is not a one way traffic, it must be a win-win situation,” he said.\n\n“One of the biggest challenges is funding, the next challenge is how are we going to mobilise the programs? These are the challenges that I think we need to talk about.\n\n“We are thrilled to be here,” Shaarani continued. “You know, we are looking into all sorts of possibilities to work with you, and not just to work with you, but to make it happen.”",

In its current form, the ASEAN Five Point Consensus cannot continue any longer,” he said.\n\nMalaysia has been leading calls for a tougher approach to Myanmar’s military administration, and has also called for ASEAN to engage with the National Unity Government (NUG) established by the elected politicians the generals removed from power.\n\nThe Philippines, Indonesia and Singapore have also pushed for a firmer line with Myanmar’s generals.\n\nThe Malaysian prime minister added that the crisis had worsened the situation for millions of refugees from Myanmar, including the mainly Muslim Rohingya refugees – nearly a million of whom now languish in sprawling refugee camps in Bangladesh.\n\n“Although Malaysia is not a signatory to the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol, Malaysia, on humanitarian grounds, accepted nearly 200,000 Rohingya refugees,” he said.\n\nAung San Suu Kyi and top figures in her cabinet and party were arrested by the coup leaders, and have since been tried on a variety of charges that critics say were fabricated to keep them out of politics.\n\nThe United Nations special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, Tom Andrews, said earlier this week that conditions for Myanmar’s 54 million people have gone from “bad to worse to horrific” as a result of the military seizing power.\n\nThe international response to the crisis caused by the military coup had “failed”, Andrews told the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.\n\nAndrews also reported that the Myanmar military had committed war crimes and crimes against humanity, including sexual violence, torture, deliberate campaigns against civilians, and murder.",

This is a strong sign of confidence in Malaysia and demonstrates that despite the impact of Covid-19, Malaysia will continue to be an attractive destination for Swedish companies to invest and grow in Asia,” said the report.\n\nIt observed that Swedish companies experienced higher profitability in 2021, than in 2019.\n\n“66% of the Swedish companies [were] profitable in 2021, compared to 61% in 2019. Similarly, the number of companies operating at a loss has decreased from 20% in 2019 to 7% in 2021,” said the report.\n\nMost respondents have a neutral or positive perception of the current business climate in Malaysia, with 46% “neutral” and another 44% perceiving the climate as “good” or “very good”.\n\nComparably, the number of companies expressing that the business climate is “poor” or “very poor” decreased to 7% in 2022, from 11% in 2020.\n\nAbout 53% of the companies that responded to the survey have more than 1,000 global employees.\n\nThe respondents come from a wide range of industries. Industrial companies represent the largest sector at 47%, followed by professional services at 38%, and consumer companies at 16%.\n\nWhile most Swedish businesses in Malaysia remain focused on Peninsular Malaysia and have limited activities in Sabah and Sarawak, two out of three respondents have a plan to grow their business in the two Borneo states.\n\n“Some see great potential in the area, while others are more sceptical of the opportunities. Several respondents stated that they have not investigated the region yet, but that they see the growth and need to start developing a presence soon,” the report said.\n\nThis report also highlighted that Swedish companies perceive “personal safety”, “access to distributors”, and “service providers” to be key advantages in doing business in Malaysia.\n\n“However, concerns and challenges highlighted in the 2020 survey remain in place today. The lack of transparency, unsatisfactory labour market regulations, and finding skilled labour locally continue to be big struggles for Swedish companies present in Malaysia,” it added.\n\nA number of companies expressed concerns regarding the ability to bring in specialised staff from abroad.\n\n“It is noteworthy that the companies that experienced difficulties in bringing in specialised staff from abroad were also more likely to respond that they would not invest more in Malaysia, indicating improved visa arrangements would go a long way towards attracting more Swedish investment,” the report said.\n\nSome 77% of the companies surveyed said they had not experienced bribery or fraud, and 86% said they had not witnessed human or labour rights abuse.\n\nIn total, there are about 90 Swedish companies based in Malaysia.\n\nIn her presentation, trade commissioner Brooms said Swedish exports to Malaysia amounted to US$400 million in 2021, while Malaysian exports to Sweden reached US$600 million.",

    "Neo-colonial designs on Malaysia": "European legal and financial instruments and institutions should not be manipulated to violate the sovereignty of Malaysia from behind the fig leaf of a spurious claim to Malaysian territory by the so-called Sultan of Sulu, Sultan Jamalul Kiram II.\n\nWhile the claim is lacking in historical, legal and political veracity, as well as being thoroughly expedient, its absurdity is underscored by Kiram's demand of an estimated RM66.4 billion for \"unpaid yearly leases\" from Malaysia, after an annual payment of RM5,300 was stopped less than 10 years ago. Exactly how 10 years of RM5,300 amounted to RM66.4 billion is unclear. It smacks, nonetheless, of attempts by the Kiram family and its backers, Therium Capital Management Ltd., to get a quick pay day. Besides trying for a quick pay day, the Sultan's claim has also paved open a way for European colonial intervention in Malaysia, through processes that should have become redundant when the European empires around the world collapsed.\n\nMalaysia is a sovereign and independent country, in which private European legal corporations have no jurisdiction. A line has to be drawn under the Kiram family's spurious claim to Sabah. The claim is invalid, as there never was a time when Sabah was not an integral part of independent Malaysia. It was, also, never the property of a single family. To claim this is just absurd, and potentially disastrous. In fact, Britain, as the last colonial power in Malaysia, should carry much of the burden and political responsibility for the disaster it left behind when the British left Malaya.\n\nREAD: Aramco CEO says Europe's energy crisis plans only short-term solution\n\nAs for the claims of financial compensation by the Kiram family, it has to be exposed for what it is: a claim based purely on greed and an insidious demand for easy money. What is more deleterious is that the European backers of the spurious claim have found – as has been demonstrated by European colonialists over decades – a docile body of former colonial \"subjects\" in the Kiram family, which can be used to tap into a rich seam of money. This is perfectly consistent with the dissolution of empire (politically), but the retention of de facto-type of empire through European legal and financial institutions. In other words, the colonialists may have left, but they want their laws and financial practices to prevail in Malaysia. This is as unacceptable as it is offensive. Malaysia is a sovereign and independent country; it cannot be held accountable to legal norms of foreign countries, especially not those of its former coloniser.\n\nWe should be clear: the Kiram family is being led by a firm, a European firm, Therium, that is primarily a \"global provider of legal finance\", as its website makes clear, which extends European legal instruments, principles and practices across the world, notably in former European colonies, like Malaysia. British legal firms, especially, use instruments via the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council – which is a formal body of advisers to the Sovereign of the United Kingdom – to interfere in Commonwealth countries, and use the UK Supreme Court as a kind of \"court of last resort\" to discipline and punish former colonies. The Sovereign of the UK has no legal or political rights in Malaysia. The Kiram family, led by Therium, and using European legal instruments and institutions, is nothing but colonisation by different means, and should be rejected outright.\n\nThis type of financial imperialism, and the enduring inequalities between the former colonial empire-builders and colonised, continues to define global inequality and power relations. Today's inequality between these rich (former colonial powers) and poor (formerly colonised societies) is the path-dependent outcome of a range of historical processes. With respect to Europe and South-East Asian countries, companies like Therium are simply the extension of European colonial legal and financial instruments and institutions to the former colonies.\n\nIt is notable that Therium has operations in the UK, Europe, the Asia-Pacific Region, the United States and Jersey (a tax-haven for shady dealings, that was part of the British empire – and under constant scrutiny for its shady dealings), and from whence it stretches its legal tentacles to resemble European colonialism. Malaysians have gotten rid of their political colonisers, but the financial imperialism attempts continue – emboldened, in this particular instance, by the Kiram family and their spurious claims to Sabahan resources.\n\nREAD: Queen Elizabeth II's state funeral starts at Westminster Abbey\n\nThe Kiram Family Claim\n\nTherium has found a sufficiently docile body in the Kiram family which, quite ironically, has turned to its former colonial masters, the Europeans, to settle disputes that are a legacy of, especially, the British Empire in South-East Asia. The family claim has to be seen in the context of European, especially British, imperialism and colonialism. The claim is completely illegitimate, based purely on monetary gain, and ill-informed. Therium will be the only financial beneficiary in this process, and that fact has to remain in focus.\n\nThe actual claim is deeply lacking in historical and legal validity. In January 1878, the Sultan of Sulu granted and ceded of \"own free and sovereign will\" Territories and Lands on the Mainland of the Island of Borneo to Gustavus Baron de Overbeck of Hong Kong and Alfred Dent Esquire of London, as representatives of a British Company. This grant was to remain effective \"forever and in perpetuity all the rights and powers belonging to us over all the territories and lands\", for which the Sultan of Sulu would receive compensation of five thousand dollars a year. An important caveat was inserted: \"In case any dispute shall arise between His Highness, the Sultan, his heirs or successors and the said Gustavus Baron de Overbeck or his Company, it is hereby agreed that the matter shall be submitted to Her Britannic Majesty's Consul-General for Borneo.\"\n\nThese material facts are straightforward and incontestable. They are legally binding, as the Sultan of Sulu stated the land should be transferred and held \"for ever and in perpetuity\" by the British Company. Consequently, at Independence, all land in Malaya held by colonial Britain, including Sabah, became part of present-day Malaysia. That a single family, the Kirams, now backed by a European legal institution, has conjured reason to stake a claim to Sabah, is not just illegitimate, historically ignorant and politically ill-informed and downright expedient, it is absurd. Ultimately, it is part of the mess that the British left behind in Malaysia.\n\nThe Kiram family claims to Sabah are a perfect opportunity for former European empires to continue forcing their legal and financial instruments and institutions on Malaysia. This should be rejected by all parties, as it may set a nasty precedent for post-colonial societies around the world.\n\nOPINION: Britain is haunted by its violent colonial past\n\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Monitor.",
    "Increase in vaping and e-cigarette use by children in Malaysia": "In Malaysia, the Consumers Association of Penang ( CAP ) has urged the government's health ministry to immediately ban all vaping devices and e-cigarettes (also called electronic nicotine delivery systems) to prevent a large number of children from become addicted to nicotine.\n\nAccording to data from WHO, e-cigarettes have nicotine and other toxic materials that are damaging both to users and non-users who receive second-hand exposure to the aerosols. Nicotine is an extremely addictive substance and evidence suggests that never-smoker minors who consume ENDS are twice as likely to smoke tobacco cigarettes later in life.\n\nAccording to research from CAP, Malaysian children can easily purchase inexpensive vapes and e-cigarettes because sellers do not ask the age of buyers. Children as young as 8 years old (who might have previously smoked cigarettes) can purchase vaping devices. Groups of children might share the prices of vaping instruments and e-cigarettes.\n\nMohideen Abdul Kader (CAP, Penang, Malaysia) said in a letter that although electronic nicotine delivery systems only became commercially available in Malaysia in early 2015, the number of people using these products in the country went up from 600 000, in 2016, to 1·2 million in 2019. From 2015 to 2020, about 30 cases of vaping-related poisoning were reported by the National Poison Center (Universiti Sains Malaysia, George Town, Malaysia), most in children aged 1–4 years, who are particularly at risk of death after e-cigarette liquid ingestion.\n\nIn Malaysia, the incidence of childhood cancer is nearly 77·4 per million in children younger than 15 years. Several studies suggest an increase in the risk of developing cancer associated with the use of e-cigarettes. Research published in February, 2022, suggests that people who use e-cigarettes face a higher risk of cancer than non-smokers. Evidence also suggests that US men and women aged 18 years and older with a history of e-cigarette use have an increased risk of developing bladder cancer and lung cancer compared with people who have never smoked. Preclinical research in mice exposed to e-cigarette smoke showed that these animals developed lung adenocarcinoma and bladder urothelial hyperplasia.\n\nMoon-shong Tang (New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA) commented that “e-cigarette users, regardless of age, have a higher risk of cancer than non-users”. To control childhood cancer, Malaysia should “[ban] e-cigarette sales to underage people”, he told The Lancet Oncology.\n\nBoris Mravec (Comenius University, Bratislava, Slovakia) told The Lancet Oncology, “the use of e-cigarettes containing nicotine in children can have, in addition to an adverse effect on brain development, another negative effect; specifically, it can stimulate the development and progression of cancer. It is known that inhaled nicotine has a stimulating effect on the sympathoadrenal system, while noradrenaline and adrenaline released from sympathetic nerve endings and the medulla of the adrenal glands affect almost all processes related to tumorigenesis, tumour growth, and development of metastases.”\n\nHowever, Sharifa Ezat Wan Puteh (National University of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia) commented that, “[at] the moment, literature does mention that the risk of vaping (quality vape juice, not adulterated) is almost negligible. We would need long-term data on vaping and clinical studies using real-world settings”, she told The Lancet Oncology. In terms of childhood cancer, she added that, “a better idea would be to facilitate better screening and access to early care. This will need financial and human resource [developments] that are stretched in the low-income and middle-income countries. Similarly, we need better screening in Malaysia and access to better care, especially for the [people with] low incomes and living in rural areas.”\n\nMore than 20 countries, the majority in South America, southeast Asia, and the Middle East, have prohibited the sale of e-cigarette products, and other countries, including Australia, Norway, and Canada, have implemented restrictions, according to Subbarow.\n\nMalaysian Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin has proposed the Tobacco Product and Smoking Control Bill 2022 that will impose a fine for sellers of tobacco or vape products to individuals born on or after Jan 1, 2007.\n\nCopyright © 2022 Svetliy/shutterstock.com",
    "Hess Starts Gas Production from NMB Phase 3 Project Offshore Malaysia": "U.S. oil firm Hess has started gas production from the North Malay Basin (NMB) Phase 3 project in Block PM302, located 290 kilometres offshore Peninsular Malaysia.\n\nMalaysian oil and gas giant Petronas shared the news of production startup on Monday.\n\nBlock PM302 is operated by Hess Corporation’s subsidiary, Hess Exploration and Production Malaysia B.V. (Hess) with a 50 percent participating interest, in partnership with Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd, which owns the remaining 50 percent.\n\nThe NMB Phase 3 project was sanctioned in 2019 and is part of a multi-phase development. It includes the installation of the new Bergading-B Wellhead Platform that adds another 100 million cubic feet per day (MMscfd) of gas supply from Block PM302, bringing the total production to 400 MMscfd.\n\nPetronas Senior Vice President of Malaysia Petroleum Management (MPM), Mohamed Firouz Asnan, said, “We are pleased that Hess has taken a long-term view of the business in Malaysia across industry cycles, demonstrating confidence in Malaysia's upstream industry. Together, we have continued to develop the NMB project to unlock the full potential of the block. This is a major milestone for both partners, as the NMB Phase 3 project is key in sustaining Peninsular Malaysia’s gas supply amid rising demand.”\n\n“The close collaboration between Block PM302 parties and their service providers in overcoming challenges during the pandemic delivered this successful completion, which reflects the overall resilience of the Malaysian Upstream ecosystem,” he added.",

This agreement is a testament to our great collaboration with Shell, and by co-ordinating the rig’s schedule across several different deep-water operators, we are driving efficiency and leveraging synergies for everyone involved.”",
    "‘Grief and memory’: Challenging Malaysia’s historical narratives": "A new documentary performance seeks to unpick the official narrative on the multiethnic Southeast Asian nation’s road to independence.\n\nThree Malaysian artists take turns scribbling symbols and motifs with chalk on a blackboard floor that doubles as a stage, singing and telling stories. A screen hung behind the stage shows live interview footage, helping take audiences on a multimedia journey that transcends traditional theatrical performance to shed light on the skeletons in the closet of Malaysian history.\n\n“We wanted to critically bring on stage the tools of the documentary or supposed ‘truth-making’ world – various cameras and media techniques such as the green screen,” director Mark Teh, a member of the Kuala Lumpur-based collective Five Arts Centre, founded in 1984, told Al Jazeera of his latest play A Notional History (2019). “The performers do everything in our show: there are no blackouts or backstage for them to hide, no stage managers to come in and transform the set.”\n\nA Notional History made its debut in Malaysia earlier in July to sold-out venues after a two-year delay because of COVID-19 performance restrictions. It features performer and musician Faiq Syazwan Kuhiri of punk band Terrer, journalist Rahmah Pauzi, and prominent political graphic designer and illustrator Fahmi Reza.\n\nMixing audiovisuals, shared perspectives, and what Teh defines as “social acting” — non-actors who perform as a version of themselves — the play digs deep into the Malaysian history of inherited memories and official narratives, and what happened during the Malayan Emergency.\n\nThe 12-year conflict, which began under colonial rule and ended in 1960 after Malaysia had become an independent nation, remains a controversial topic. The war was largely fought in the jungles between the pro-independence communist fighters of the Malayan National Liberation Army, and the soldiers of the British colonisers.\n\n“I can attribute it to the contested narrative and enduring campaign designed by both the British colonial government as well as the ruling government post-independence with the ultimate objective to suppress any elements of progressive and leftist political fronts in the region,” said Zikri Rahman, the programme coordinator for Pusat Sejarah Rakyat, an independent Kuala Lumpur-based organisation focused on archiving and publishing different forms of historical material from a people’s perspective.\n\n“Not only that, but the issue also remains contested as it does take a racialised turn on who can claim to be a victim during the Emergency period,” Zikri told Al Jazeera.\n\nMany of the country’s ethnic Chinese were relocated to so-called “new villages” so that the jungle-based fighters would not be able to come to them for food and other support, while the Malays were the target of what Zukri says was “a much subtler campaign of land redistribution and economic reform. Both communities were experiencing a violent act of displacement and dispossession.”\n\nTeaching history\n\nHistory is a compulsory subject for secondary school students in Malaysia and A Notional History was inspired by the publication of new history textbooks that were released in 2020.\n\nThe “updating” had begun under the United Malays National Organisation(UMNO)-dominated Barisan Nasional coalition that controlled Malaysia for more than 60 years after independence, but the books were only published after the 2018 general elections when the coalition lost power for the first time.\n\n“It so happened that the revisions for the Form Four textbook – which focuses on the period encompassing World War II, the Japanese occupation, the Malayan Emergency, and Merdeka (independence) – coincided with UMNO’s fall and the coming into power of the Pakatan Harapan coalition led by Mahathir Mohamad,” Teh told Al Jazeera. Mahathir himself had previously been the leader of UMNO and prime minister of Malaysia for more than 20 years.\n\n“This textbook was published in 2020, and we were really keen to compare what had changed between the revisions, and more interestingly, to consider what remained unchangeable or ‘unforgivable’ – even under a New Malaysia.”\n\nThe performance makes use of original video interviews with exiled former Malaysian communist revolutionaries. UMNO, the ethnic Malay party that has long dominated Malaysian politics, opposed the fighters from its founding in 1946, and when in power promoted a narrative that the communists, who were mostly but not entirely ethnic Chinese, were a threat to national security and order.\n\nUncovering historical erasures, exclusions, and the official narrative of the communist fight, A Notional History is another collaboration by a tight-knit group of friends and revolving collaborators who have produced a variety of theatre performances, documentary videos, art exhibitions, curatorial projects, participatory interventions, and online initiatives over the past 15 years.\n\nEarlier projects have also focused on history – after years of meticulous research – including Baling (2015-18), Version 2020 (2017-18) and Fragments of Tuah (2022).\n\nBaling was somewhat of a precursor to A Notional History, dabbling in the big unanswered questions of Malaysia’s bumpy road to independence by reconstructing and analysing the historic December 1955 negotiations between Tunku Abdul Rahman (the then-soon-to-be first prime minister of newfound Malaysia), David Marshall, who represented the then-Crown Colony of Singapore, and Chin Peng – the much feared and demonised leader of the Malayan Communist Party and the Malayan National Liberation Army.\n\nReading directly from public transcripts, Baling’s performer-researchers reflected on the meaning of freedom, loyalty, “terrorism”, and surrender.\n\n“One of the threads in Baling was to relook at the figure of Chin Peng and deconstruct or demystify this Public Enemy Number One – or Most Wanted Man in the British Empire, or Last Communist,” Teh told Al Jazeera. “Rather than focusing on his life story, we investigated how the monstrous phantom of Chin Peng had been operationalised by the British and then the Malayan/Malaysian government through propaganda and fearmongering.”\n\nTeh believes that the national hysteria around Chin Peng is a paradox - exiled across the border in southern Thailand, the communist leader was physically absent from Malaysia, but the nation went to great lengths to make him feel “present” and “dangerous”. Even in 2013 after Chin Peng’s death, the then-government refused to allow his ashes to be returned to the country.\n\nDangers of communist label\n\nA Notional History follows a similar direction to Baling by interweaving monologues, songs, and music by Terrer’s Faiq, and Fahmi’s detailed explanations of what sections of the national history textbooks misrepresent historical facts from the crucial decade before Malaysia declared independence on August 31, 1957.\n\nA screen behind the performers enhances the points of view of the non-actors with interview footage from Revolusi ’48, Fahmi’s unreleased documentary on 11 communist rebel fighters who disappeared into the northern Malaysian jungle in 1948 – a companion piece to his earlier documentary 10 Tahun Sebelum Merdeka (Ten Years Before Independence), which chronicled the Malaya-wide day of protest against Britain’s undemocratic proposals for a Federation of Malaya, and the rise of the people’s democratic movement in Malaya.\n\n“We saw these as the various different strands that contributed to Malaya’s struggle for independence, besides UMNO-Barisan National. But as Fahmi mentions in the performance, he was not able to complete the documentary as he was worried it would be misinterpreted as glorifying armed violence, and he was also concerned about the backlash – of being labelled a communist sympathiser,” Teh told Al Jazeera.\n\nA Notional History also includes footage from the 2018 public forum in Kuala Lumpur, Should We Rewrite Our History Textbooks? in which Fahmi was publicly attacked by Malaysian right-wing groups.\n\nThe episode triggered a harsh social media backlash during which the activist was called a “communist”.\n\n“Within certain contexts – such as Malaysia, Singapore, or Indonesia – the label ‘communist’ has been weaponised by the state and their supporters to discredit, imprison and even eliminate and murder people,” said Teh.\n\nBefore the COVID-19 lockdowns, A Notional History was presented with success at the Performing Arts Meeting in the Japanese city of Yokohama, as well as in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta. Hundreds of thousands of people were accused of being communists in Indonesia between 1965 and 1966, and killed.\n\n“In Indonesia, the topic of communism is more charged than the other places we’ve performed at,” Faiq told Al Jazeera of the performance at Teater Salihara. “The audience’s reaction to the struggles of the [Malaysian] communists felt deeper and more immediate”.\n\nAs soon as the world began to reopen, the play made its debut outside of Asia in May 2022 at the Kunstenfestivaldesarts in Brussels – one of the leading European festivals for contemporary performing arts – before finally arriving back in Malaysia.\n\n“It’s been a blessing to be able to perform it in different countries, feeling the slight differences in reactions from different places,” said Faiq.\n\n“What I’ve learned from this process is that even though the subject matter of our work has its own specificities to Malaysian history, it is also universal. […] What I wish the audience felt and saw in the performance, at least from my perspective, is to take into account the personal choices, encounters, desires, griefs and memories of these old communists based on a decision they made a long time ago.”",

    "Fighting corruption in Malaysia: What’s missing? — Hafiz Hassan": "SEPT 24 — Singapore is the least corrupt Asian country according to Transparency International’s (TI) Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) from 1995 to 2021.\n\nIn 1995, Singapore was ranked third among 41 countries. Last year, Singapore shared joint fourth ranking with Norway and Sweden amongst 180 countries with a score of 85.\n\nMalaysia was ranked 62/180 with a score of 48/100. According to TI, countries like Malaysia which are stuck in the middle of the index were facing the complex challenge of “grand corruption.”\n\nThis is the abuse of high-level power that benefits the few at the expense of the many, and which can destroy whole sectors, create recessions and end democracies.\n\nAddressing grand corruption “requires the systematic dismantling of rent-seeking structure and dishonest cultures that public officials use to pocket funds. This needs to be driven by political leaders who hold power to account, for the common good.”\n\nAll forms of power and power holders at all levels must be held to account.\n\nIs there anything to learn from Singapore?\n\nThe founding father of the modern island city-state Lee Kuan Yew once attributed his country’s effective system of combating corruption to four factors in a speech in Parliament in 1987. He said:\n\n“First, on the law against corruption contained in the Prevention of Corruption Act; second, on a vigilant public ready to give information on all suspected corruption; and third, on a Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) — an anti-corruption agency — which is scrupulous, thorough, and fearless in its investigations. For this to be so, the CPIB has to receive the full backing of the Prime Minister under whose portfolio it comes. But the strongest deterrent is in a public opinion which censures and condemns corrupt persons, in other words, in attitudes which make corruption so unacceptable that the stigma of corruption cannot be washed away by serving a prison sentence.”\n\nWhat’s missing in Malaysia?\n\nWe have the law, contained in the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) Act. Do we have a vigilant public ready to give information on all suspected corruption? — Picture by Hari Anggara\n\nWe have the law, contained in the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) Act. Do we have a vigilant public ready to give information on all suspected corruption? How about an anti-corruption agency — the MACC — which is scrupulous, thorough and fearless in its investigations?\n\nIs the government’s stand against corruption as unequivocal as the government in Singapore? The late Lee’s son, Lee Hsien Loong, who now leads the city-state once said of his government’s unequivocal stand against corruption as follows:\n\n“Let me be quite clear: We will never tolerate corruption and we will not accept any slackening. Anyone who breaks the rules will be caught and punished — no cover-ups, no matter how senior the officer or how embarrassing it may be.\n\n“It is far better to suffer the embarrassment and keep the system clean than to pretend that nothing went wrong and let the rot spread. ... And part of the solution has to be that if you do it, we will catch and punish you. ... Political leaders must continue to set high standards of honesty and integrity.\n\n“The society must continue to reject corruption — not just because of rules and penalties, but because this reflects the society we want to live in, and the values we hold ourselves to.”\n\nA public opinion that censures and condemns corruption and corrupt persons and a government that is unequivocal in its stand against corruption constitute what has been referred to as incorruptibility ingrained in the Singaporean psyche. (See Lee, H.L., “Incorruptibility ingrained in S’porean psyche”, Straits Times, 19 September 2012)\n\nIs a Malaysian psyche missing as well?\n\n*This is the personal opinion of the writer or columnist and does not necessarily represent the views of Malay Mail.",

    "Despite lifting of mask mandate, most Malaysians keep wearing one... just to be on the safe side": "The majority of shoppers in this Kuala Lumpur shopping mall are still wearing face masks. — Picture by Shafwan Zaidon\n\nKUALA LUMPUR, Sept 26 — Despite the government’s lifting of the face mask mandate, many Malaysians still prefer to keep their masks on indoors.\n\nA visit to Mid Valley Megamall and neighbouring Bangsar saw that the majority of shoppers — with the exception of some younger individuals and foreigners — still wearing face masks.\n\n“I think it’s safer to wear a mask because I also don’t know if you have Covid or not, so I’m still worried,” said Jaja, 32.\n\nJaja, 32, prefers to wear a face mask as a precaution. — Picture by Shafwan Zaidon\n\nJaja added that she and her parents are high-risk so she prefers to take extra steps to protect them.\n\nTarmizi, 29, shared the same sentiment as Jaja and he still wears his mask although there are no high-risk individuals in his family.\n\nTarmizi, 29, still prefers to play it safe and wear a face mask. — Picture by Shafwan Zaidon\n\n“I want to protect myself from the crowd but to wear or not to wear the face mask is up to the individual,” added Tarmizi.\n\nNeoh Wei Sheng, 21, who was seen wearing a face mask in Bangsar told Malay Mail that he wears it to protect himself from getting infected a second time.\n\n“I think it’s right to lift the face mask mandate because we should not force people and let them decide whether to wear or not to wear.\n\n“For example, they can remove the mask when it’s making them feel uncomfortable,” said Neoh when asked if he agreed that the country should lift the face mask mandate.\n\nHe added that he doesn’t feel the presence of Covid-19 as strongly as before since the country has moved into the endemic phase.\n\n“Basically, I don’t feel the pandemic anymore, or we have started to treat it as a normal fever and flu,” said Neoh.\n\nAnother interviewee who was also wearing a face mask disagreed with Neoh.\n\nMazuan, 26, said he can still feel the presence of Covid-19 in his immediate circle because four of his colleagues tested positive this month.\n\nMazuan, 26, said he still feels the presence of Covid-19. — Picture by Shafwan Zaidon\n\n“Just for precaution until things are 100 per cent normal then it’s ok, but right now we still need to wear masks,” he added.\n\nOn the other hand, some told Malay Mail they have stopped wearing face masks because they felt uncomfortable and praised the government for lifting the mandate.\n\n“Actually, I don’t like wearing masks because I don’t feel comfortable. I can’t feel air when I’m breathing with my masks,” said Robert Cemba, 27, when approached by Malay Mail.\n\nCemba said that mask-wearing also caused skin issues, especially rashes behind the ears, adding to the reasons why some people don’t like wearing masks.\n\nWhen asked if he feels safe if people around him are not wearing masks, he said that one should take the risk to socialise and come to terms with the existence of Covid-19.\n\nA couple from India agreed with Cemba that wearing masks has caused them a lot of discomfort.\n\n“In my country India, it has turned into a flu, if you have the virus then you are like down for three to four days,” said Sampath JM, 62.\n\nKalpana Sampath, 54, added that it’s also important to do other preventive measures such as exercising regularly, maintaining a healthy diet and practising good hygiene habits to boost our immunity against sickness.\n\n“If you go back home, wash your feet, wash your hands, gargle... these are the things we did many years ago when we were young,” Sampath added.\n\nEarlier this month, Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin announced that the wearing of face masks indoors as optional with the exception of public transport and all healthcare facilities.\n\nKhairy said that making masks optional indoors was the natural progression given Malaysia’s high vaccination rate and compliance with SOPS.",
    "Exicom emerges as largest EV charging brand in Malaysia": "Exicom emerges as largest EV charging brand in Malaysia | By By\n\nKUALA LUMPUR, Sept. 26, 2022 /PRNewswire/ — Exicom, the leading EV charger and Li-ion battery manufacturer today said it has emerged as the largest EV charging brand in Malaysia with 40 per cent share in the country.\n\nBacked by technology and world-class innovation, Exicom has become the trusted technology provider for EV charging in Malaysia. It has been able to achieve this feat in 3 years, since it set foot in the Southeast Asian market as part of its strategy to expand global footprint.\n\nThe company also has a strategic tie-up with Green EV Charge (previously known as Yinson GreenTech) for expanding the charging infrastructure in the country. Exicom also supplies fast chargers to car dealers through Pekema (Persatuan Pengimpot Peniaga Kenderaan Melayu Malaysia). This apart, it is also setting up fast charging stations on Malaysian highways with various partners including Tenaga Nasional.\n\nExicom believes that one of the biggest factors impeding the growth in adoption of electric vehicles is the lack of charging infrastructure.\n\nThough the EV industry in Malaysia is still at a nascent stage, the country is focussing on developing supporting infrastructure in line with the aim to become a carbon-neutral country by 2050. As stated in its 12th Malaysia Plan, the government is determined to support its e-mobility initiative by focussing on the development of EVs and their supporting infrastructure.\n\nSharing his perspective on the achievement, Anant Nahata, Managing Director at Exicom, said, “Malaysia has immense potential for growth in the EV markets in the SEA region and offers vast opportunity for a technology player of our stature to secure our position as a market leader. We take pride in participating in the growth and development of the EV ecosystem with rigorous R&D and technology-backed products. Our future-ready products will propel us to gain strong foothold in the SEA market and help put Exicom brand on the global EV ecosystem map.”\n\nExicom is at the forefront of EV charger deployment with its products backed by 50 months of R&D and technology development at its facility in National Capital Region of India.\n\nDue to its world-class innovations, the company continues to remain a trusted technology provider for marque automotive brands such as Tata Motors, MG, Vovlo etc. Exicom has already deployed DC chargers at various automotive headquarters and key showrooms, with a nationwide rollout predicted to accelerate over the next 24-36 months.\n\nFor further information, kindly contact exicom@adfactorspr.com",

    "Why The Price of Petrol Increased in Indonesia But Not in Malaysia": "Despite some superficial similarities, the production and distribution of energy is structured quite differently in the two countries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith high fuel prices causing political and economic headaches around the world these days, now seems like a good time to do a quick explainer on the political economy of petrol in two neighboring but quite different energy markets, Malaysia and Indonesia. Both countries have historically had large reserves of oil and gas, the production and distribution of which is dominated by state-owned companies: Indonesia’s Pertamina and Malaysia’s Petronas. But that’s really where the similarities end.\n\nDespite receiving billions in subsidies from the government, Pertamina has not been earning big profits lately and the government recently reduced subsidies, causing prices at the pump to rise and kicking off demonstrations around the country. Malaysia’s Petronas, on the other hand, has been reliably profitable, pays big dividends to the state, and has kept the price of diesel and RON 95 petrol steady despite volatility in global energy markets. Why can’t Pertamina be more like Petronas? Is this a simple case of government and corporate mismanagement?\n\nNot exactly. Energy markets in Indonesia and Malaysia are fundamentally different, and thus the goals of policymakers and their economic agents – such as state-owned energy companies – are also going to be different. We need to understand these differences if we want to make sense of these divergent outcomes.\n\nIndonesia was once a major global supplier of oil. There was a time when oil exports were basically the main source of revenue for the government, and the country’s economic health was closely tied to Pertamina. There wasn’t a lot of local demand in the 1970s, so Indonesian consumers could be supplied on the cheap while the surplus was exported at a healthy profit. Cheap petrol for Indonesian consumers is a legacy of that era.\n\nDiplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. Get the Newsletter\n\nThose days are over. In 2021, Pertamina’s domestic sales of oil and gas reached $39.3 billion, compared to $8.3 billion in exports. The domestic market is now overwhelmingly the key market, and it consumes most of what is produced in Indonesia. This is a bit of a problem, because Indonesia is producing less than it used to while consumers have gotten used to the days of abundant and cheap oil.\n\nEnjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Energy, Indonesia’s proven oil reserves fell from 4 billion barrels in 2011 to 2.25 billion in 2021. Domestic crude production decreased from 329 million barrels in 2011 to 240 million in 2021. Pertamina’s limited refinery capacity means that it has become ever more reliant on imports and thus more sensitive to swings to global energy prices.\n\nBecause the domestic market dominates Pertamina’s business, and because pricing for domestic consumption is as much about politics as it is about economics, we shouldn’t expect Pertamina to chase profits or to be run like a normal business. We should expect the primary goal to be keeping Indonesian consumers insulated from big price increases. And indeed, fuel prices are still lower than they would be if they reflected true market conditions.\n\nPetronas, on the other hand, is built differently. For one thing, Malaysia has a much smaller domestic market than Indonesia, accounting for only around 26.5 percent of revenue in 2021. Just like Pertamina in the 1970s, the major share of what it produces can be sold outside of Malaysia at competitive prices rather than sold to domestic consumers at lower rates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPetronas also has a much more extensive global production and distribution network, which means it is not oriented toward the domestic market to the same extent as Pertamina. This makes it easier for Petronas to act like a more traditional, profit-maximizing business. During times of high oil prices it can book big profits from upstream production, while keeping the retail cost of petrol for Malaysian consumers stable. On the flip side, this global exposure also means Petronas performed quite poorly in 2020 when the pandemic caused demand to dry up.\n\nThe production and distribution of energy is structured quite differently in Indonesia than in Malaysia, reflecting structural factors such as market size and domestic supply. Such factors will naturally be translated into distinct pricing strategies and business operations at each of the state-owned oil and gas companies. So when petrol prices go up in Indonesia while holding steady in Malaysia even as Petronas books healthy profits, the comparison is not so clear cut as it may seem.",
    "House of the year, Malaysia: CIMB": "With the dawning of 2021, investors in Malaysia were cautiously optimistic that the worst of the pandemic was behind them but, as the year unfurled, it quickly became clear that recovery was going to be a slow process. Amid the persistent market turmoil and prolonged lockdowns, CIMB’s market-making and structuring capabilities continued to prove their worth.\n\n“The Covid-19 pandemic came as a real shock to the whole banking system. Faced with large-scale lockdowns and uncertainty as to when this would all end, some banks pared down their risk. But in CIMB’s case, we adapted and learned fast, and by the end of the year we had a strong liquidity position and were continuing to quote prices in the market,” says Chu Kok Wei, co-chief executive officer of group wholesale banking.\n\nAs a result, CIMB was able to maintain a leading position in the market and even strengthen its footprint in certain asset classes.\n\nRising rates\n\nCIMB’s strength in interest rate structuring has been particularly appreciated by clients, as clients have started to prepare for rising interest rates around the world.\n\n“In the last one year the overall market sentiment has changed,” says Chu. “We had many clients who were looking to lock in fixed dollar rates or even local ringgit interest rates, due to the higher interest rate environment that was taking hold from the end of last year.”\n\nAs the MYR interest rate curve has steepened, CIMB’s sophisticated warehousing capabilities have also allowed the bank to bring more competitive and advanced pricing to clients.\n\nAn example of this is the Callable Islamic Range Accrual (Cira) note, linked to the Kuala Lumpur Interbank Offered Rate. This product was originally launched in 2020, and proved a perfect fit for many of the bank’s clients during Covid by offering a safe harbour via exposure to traditionally stable MYR rates.\n\nAt the end of last year, with a rate-hike cycle widely expected to start in 2022, CIMB sensed an opportunity to improve pricing. At the end of March, CIMB was able to offer a profit rate of 4.28% per year, for a five-year Cira product, non-callable for six months. This was 2.48% above prevailing deposit rates at the time.\n\n“Given our warehousing capabilities we are able to provide very competitive pricing versus the market, and so we have seen an increase in the number of clients and new funds coming to the bank to buy our products,” says Chu.\n\nAs a result of this attractive pricing structure, volumes for Cira during the awards period under review increased by 576% compared to the previous 12 months.\n\nBut the strength of CIMB’s success is more than that. Not only does it offer its own products to the market, but other banks often turn to it for price-making on this.\n\n“Other banks have also reached out to us to hedge their issuance of the same product, so I would say that a lot of the other transaction volume seen in the Malaysia market is also coming back to CIMB itself,” says Chu.\n\nNew structures\n\nIn terms of new product launches at CIMB, one that has done particularly well was in the forex space: a Sharkfin structure that provides a variable yield linked directly to the movement of the underlying currency.\n\nThis principal-guaranteed product is intended to be fairly short-term – between six and 12 months – and can be adapted to the customer’s preferences by tweaking tenor, strike levels and currency pair. The product knocks out and pays the client a fixed coupon if its value dipped beneath a certain level.\n\n“This was the first time we had offered this kind of product to private banking clients in a principal-guaranteed format, and it filled the gap on our product shelf,” says Chu. “We have a lot of short-term products for forex, and many longer-term products for fixed income and rates, but we needed a product to fill the six-month to one-year tenor, and that is where this product fits in.”\n\nCredit\n\nOn the credit side, CIMB has been looking at ways of offering clients extra leverage.\n\nThe bank recently developed a product to provide investors with leveraged exposure to specified bonds on a non-recourse basis, with an option to buy at a tenor shorter than the underlying bond’s maturity. The product features various protective provisions including an early termination trigger that aims to mitigate the issuer’s risk while allowing sufficient scope for the investor to participate in the upside.\n\nCIMB says it has received a lot of inquiries from clients on this new product, although no trades have yet closed.\n\nAnother development was to allow the use of credit-linked notes (CLNs) as collateral for portfolio financing. This has enhanced the appeal of such notes for clients and contributed to the revival of CLN issuances that was seen at the start of the year.\n\n“We are confident these products will help to grow the business franchise and meet clients’ demand for leveraged tools to manage their investments,” says Chu.",

Latent anxiety about the xin yimin has emerged among Malaysians but it has as yet not become an explosive issue in Malaysian politics.\n\nGuest writer, Ngeow Chow Bing, is Director at the Institute of China Studies, University of Malaya, Malaysia.\n\nISEAS Perspective 2022/94, 23 September 2022\n\nDownload PDF Version\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe term xin yimin (new China migrants) refers to the Chinese migrants of the latest wave—those who ventured out of China since the enactment of Deng Xiaoping’s “reform and opening-up” policies in the late 1970s. The recent waves of xin yimin could be characterized as being of mobile, circulatory, and transitory nature, and is fundamentally different from the early Chinese migration to Southeast Asia. Today, out of the eleven Southeast Asian countries, Singapore is one of the few places where the xin yimin can easily obtain legal naturalisation. However, while the xin yimin often stay in this region for a sustained period, they rarely remain for permanent settlement.\n\nMalaysia has a sizable xin yimin population, yet not much research has been published regarding this community, with the exception of a unique aspect of the xin yimin phenomenon in Malaysia—the presence of the ethnic Hui xin yimin. The Hui, who are mostly Chinese Muslims, find Malaysia ideal for a combination of reasons—it is a society in which the practice of their religion, Islam, is widely encouraged and it has sufficient Chinese cultural space for them to live comfortably. The Hui were in fact the xin yimin pioneers in Malaysia.\n\nThis paper provides an updated and comprehensive overview of the xin yimin in Malaysia in light of their growing numbers in the country and their potential impact on society.[1] It will discuss their numbers, organisations, and some preliminary implications for Malaysia.\n\nTRENDS AND NUMBERS\n\nIt is difficult to estimate the size of the xin yimin community in Malaysia as there is no single definition of the term. However, broadly speaking, xin yimin comprise of three categories: 1) PRC citizens who have successfully become naturalised citizens of Malaysia; 2) PRC citizens who are staying in Malaysia legally for a sustained period of time, such as students, expatriates, workers, and so forth; and 3) PRC citizens who are staying in Malaysia illegally, mostly by overstaying their visas.\n\nGiven Malaysia’s strict naturalisation process, the first category is negligible.[2] Putting the second and third categories together, a rough estimation of the number of xin yimin in Malaysia is 82,000 (see Table 1).\n\n\n\nTable 1: Estimating the Number of Xin Yimin in Malaysia\n\nStudents in Tertiary Institutions\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Higher Education of Malaysia, as of 2021, the number of PRC students in Malaysia was 28,593.[3] This was a sharp increase from 10,775 in 2015, seeing Malaysia effectively displacing Indonesia and Bangladesh to become the largest source country of international students in Malaysia’s higher education institutions (see Table 2). Moreover, compared to the 1990s and 2000s, when PRC students were generally concentrated in private universities and colleges within the Klang Valley region (the area surrounding the metropolitan Kuala Lumpur), students from PRC are today abundantly found in both public and private institutions across different states in Malaysia, including Sabah and Sarawak. Due to their relatively higher ranking and prestigious status, these public universities are especially popular among PRC students.\n\nThis is due to several factors. The relatively affordable price and decent quality of Malaysia’s higher education, the short distance between Malaysia and China, and the widespread use of the English language are intrinsic appeals to the PRC students. Moreover, the recent deterioration of China’s relations with the Western world has had an impact as well, and more and more PRC students are starting to look for alternatives to Western universities. Conversely, the Malaysian government and universities have also been keen to tap into the huge PRC student market, having put many years of effort into marketing themselves.[4]\n\nTable 2: PRC Students in Malaysia’s Tertiary Institutions\n\nMalaysia My 2nd Home (MM2H) Scheme Holders\n\nMalaysia My 2nd Home (MM2H) is a scheme to attract foreign citizens (primarily wealthy retirees) to bring financial capital (in the form of a bank fixed deposits), investment, and consumption to Malaysia. MM2H holders are given a ten-year renewable visa, which almost makes them permanent residents of the country. MM2H holders, however, are not allowed to be employed in any form by either the public or private sectors in Malaysia, but are allowed to buy properties and open up businesses to generate income and employment.\n\nWhen MM2H was first implemented in the early 2000s, the target population was Japanese retirees. However, the rapid rise of the Chinese economy and its affluent middle class have led to PRC citizens becoming the largest group of MM2H holders. According to the MM2H agency, as of 2019, the total number of accumulated MM2H holders was 48,471. Among them, 30.5 percent were PRC citizens (14,541).[5] Japan was a distant second (11.3 percent).\n\nIn 2021, the Malaysian government revised the MM2H criteria with a higher threshold. The revised scheme affects both existing and potential applicants, and the number of MM2H applicants is expected to decline.[6] However, due to the ongoing COVID-related travel restrictions, it is difficult to ascertain the impact of this new scheme on the current and future applicants from the PRC.[7]\n\nExpatriates/Workers\n\nMalaysia issues several categories of visas for foreigners to be employed legally within the country, ranging from professional visit pass (mostly for skilled professionals/ expatriates) to employment and temporary employment pass (generally for low-skilled workers). In the early 2000s, there were tentative talks about opening the general labour market of Malaysia to PRC workers, but up until now, except for a few selected sectors, Malaysia has not opened its general labour market to China’s workers. Therefore, almost all legally employed PRC citizens are likely to be holders of the professional visit pass. However, an unknown portion of them certainly use this pass to work as labourers, especially in the construction sector.\n\nThe number of PRC expatriates/workers has increased over the decades, but it noticeably peaked around 2017-2018. In 2017, the Malaysia’s government disclosed that out of 1.7 million foreign workers in Malaysia, PRC workers accounted for 15,399.[8] In 2019, that figure had fallen to 13,305 (out of 1.99 million foreign workers).[9]\n\nOn the other hand, the figures for PRC expatriates/workers provided in the Annual Foreign Investment Country Guide: Malaysia, compiled by the Ministry of Commerce of China, were somewhat higher (Table 3), although the declining trend since 2017-2018 can be similarly observed.[10] Reasons for the decline could be partly political (Malaysia’s political transition in 2018 that created some initial uncertainties), economic (China’s slowing economy) and the pandemic (especially in 2020 and after).\n\nTable 3: PRC Expatriates/Workers in Malaysia According to China’s Ministry of Commerce)\n\nIt is safe to assume that the data from both China and Malaysia only include workers with legal status. There are however occasional reports of PRC workers being illegally employed (and exploited) in Malaysia, especially in construction projects contracted to private enterprises from China.[11] The exact number of illegal workers however, is difficult-to-calculate (see later discussion). Nevertheless, it is very unlikely that the number of illegal PRC workers exceeds the legal one, and based on the declining press reports on this issue, the trend suggests that the number of illegal PRC workers in Malaysia has lessened, although they are by no means completely absent.\n\nSpouses, Students in Private International Schools and Their Guardians, Permanent Residents\n\nPRC spouses of Malaysian citizens (mostly wives) staying in Malaysia are estimated to number around 6,000.[12] They possess a “long-term social visit pass” for their stay, which is renewable every five years. Additionally, they are allowed to work, but subject to certain conditions.\n\nPrivate international schools have sprung up in Malaysia in the past few years and have attracted many affluent families within Malaysia and internationally. These international schools can issue their own student visas to international students. As of 2021, there were 924 PRC students attending these schools using student visas, ranking second to South Korea, which has 1,717 students).[13] Given that most PRC students are below the legal age of eighteen, they would likely have at least one guardian (parent or grandparent, widely known as peidu mama or peidu nainai) staying with them. As such, the total number of these students and guardians is estimated to be 2,000.\n\nAs of June 2022, 2,346 PRC citizens have obtained Permanent Resident (PR) status in Malaysia. China is the seventh largest source country for PRs in Malaysia.[14]\n\nIllegal Xin Yimin\n\nOverstaying their visas is one of the main ways for PRC citizens to reside in Malaysia illegally. In 2004, a deputy consul at the Embassy of China in Malaysia suggested that possibly a whopping 185,000 PRC citizens had overstayed their visa periods in Malaysia. However, it was later clarified that the number could be between 20,000 and 40,000. Most of these came from rural areas in China and were deceived by fraudulent companies and agents. They were promised legal working permits and manual labour work in Malaysia but suffered serious exploitation once they arrived.[15]\n\nOther than manual work, a few of these illegal PRC citizens were also entrepreneurial enough to open small businesses on their own, often as food stall operators, hawkers and small traders. Female prostitution is also another line of illicit/illegal work. Not all prostitutes were illegal; some had proper visas such as student pass or social visit pass. However, many of them were victims of criminal gangs who had deceived and manipulated them into prostitution.\n\nIn 2019, the director general of the immigration department of Malaysia disclosed that between 2016 and 2018, 18,341 PRC citizens who entered Malaysia via tourist visas did not have exit records.[16] This could be taken as a rough estimation of the number of PRC citizens staying illegally in Malaysia.[17] Despite the lack of consistent data, the long-term trend is almost certainly a declining one. As China becomes richer, the outward drive for its poorer citizens to do manual labour legally or illegally outside the country also declined. Furthermore, the Chinese government has always warned its citizens against taking up illegal jobs in Malaysia, and both Malaysia and China have collaborated to resolve the issue.[18]\n\nORGANISATIONS AND NETWORKS\n\nIn terms of formal organisations, xin yimin organisations are mostly concentrated in two sectors: the business sector and the student body (Table 4).\n\nTable 4: Organisations Related to Xin Yimin in Malaysia\n\nThe most important and authoritative xin yimin business organisation in Malaysia is the China Enterprises Chamber of Commerce in Malaysia (CECCM), founded in 2002. Its secretariat is housed at the Bank of China in Malaysia and its current chairperson is the president of Malaysia’s Bank of China. The chairperson of CECCM, by convention, always comes from the banking industry. It has over 250 members (corporate members only, individuals as associate members), and a majority of the membership consists of China’s state-owned enterprises (SOEs). CECCM maintains close ties with the Embassy of China, particularly the Trade and Economic department. It has two autonomous branches: Northern Malaysia (Penang) and Sarawak. It serves as a platform for the PRC’s SOEs to discuss business collaborations and also as a channel of interaction with relevant government departments of Malaysia. Other than business activities, it also organises charity and corporate social responsibility events on behalf of its members.[20]\n\nOne of the non-“mainstream” xin yimin business organisations in Malaysia is the China Enterprises Association of Malaysia (CEAM). Founded in 2015, it caters to China’s small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia, and currently has a membership of 160 SMEs. The founding of CEAM was somewhat a contentious affair, especially with the presence of CECCM. On top of that, it was not officially endorsed by the Embassy of China in its early years. However, in recent years, CEAM has been accepted as the secondary xin yimin business organisation by the Chinese Embassy.[21]\n\nA new phenomenon in Malaysia is the rise of various PRC provincial and regional business associations, consisting of PRC business entities or persons from the same province or region (such as Hebei, Shandong, etc). As of today, there are eight of them. These organisations provide new linkages between Malaysia and different provinces of China, beyond Guangdong and Fujian.\n\nFor PRC students, the major organisation is the China Students Association Malaysia (CSAM). There have been disputes over its founding year (2002 or 2008) but it was formally registered in 2013 in Malaysia, serving as the national organisation connecting all PRC student associations in over 20 Malaysian higher education institutions (public and private, mostly in the Klang Valley). CSAM also serves as a network for taking care of PRC students, liaises with the Embassy of China (supporting Embassy activities such as festivals of leaders’ visits), and organises social, educational, and youth exchange activities between Malaysia and China.[22] Another student-related organisation, although not directly, is the Malaysia Association of China Students Alumni (MACSA). Founded in 2012, it has about 1,000 members. These are PRC citizens who studied in Malaysia’s universities and have stayed on to work in Malaysia after graduation.\n\nThe president of MACSA (Huang Bin) also founded a non-governmental organisation (NGO) known as the Malaysia China Welfare Advisory Society to help distressed PRC citizens in Malaysia.[23] It has a cooperative relationship with the Consular Protection Department of the Embassy of China and operates a hotline and a WeChat account. The Malaysia China Welfare Advisory Society has been praised by the Chinese government as being exemplary in providing assistance to xin yimin.[24]\n\nIMPLICATIONS\n\nOverall, despite the pandemic temporary changing migration patterns, the number of xin yimin in Malaysia is expected to increase. Most xin yimin find Malaysia a comfortable place to live in due to its sizable ethnic Chinese community. As a xin yimin said, “there are so many Chinese that you can integrate into the society easily.”[25] In fact, xin yimin-styled “Chinatowns” have emerged in Kuala Lumpur such as Nanjing Street at Sunway Velocity Mall. However, the comfort that the xin yimin feel about the sizable Malaysian Chinese community also suggests that most of the xin yimin have an asymmetrical pattern of interaction with the broader Malaysian society. Apart from the Hui, most xin yimin have relatively limited interaction with the non-Chinese communities in Malaysia. In this sense, whatever impact that the xin yimin may create in the future would be first absorbed by the Malaysian Chinese community–the community that is effectively a buffer between the xin yimin and other circles of Malaysian society. So far, the ethnic Chinese do not perceive the xin yimin as a threat, nor does their presence significantly shape the way they practise their culture.[26]\n\nSome Malaysians are worried that the xin yimin are economic competitors to the local population and that they do not bring economic benefits. A Malaysian academic once commented that Malaysians may “not be comfortable with a glut of foreigners coming to Malaysia and potentially doing business or eating into the market. If this happens, it may strain the relations between Malaysians–regardless of race–and Chinese nationals.”[27] However, the economic impact of the xin yimin in Malaysiahas never actually been properly studied. While they could certainly bring competition to the locals and may not provide economic spillover effects, they could generate consumption, employment, capital inflows, and new business opportunities for Malaysians.\n\nFinally, Malaysian politics is hypersensitive to ethnic issues and there is latent anxiety, especially among the Malays, that the xin yimin will upset the delicate ethnic balance in the country. The asymmetrical pattern of interaction between the xin yimin and the Malaysian society suggests that outside of the ethnic Chinese circle, much is unknown about this community. Populist fear of large-scale Chinese “colonisation” that may undermine the local Malay majority and upset the delicate balance is an easily exploitable myth. Furthermore, anti-xin yimin fake news has also emerged after 2018.[28] Some insensitive xin yimin have also been oblivious to sensitive historical and ethnic issues in Malaysia, and may behave in ways that fuel suspicion and hostility.[29]\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nOver the last 20 years, the xin yimin have become more proper (with fewer illegal xin yimin), organised, and resourceful. Once the pandemic-related restrictions are lifted in China, the upward trend of the xin yimin in Malaysia is likely to resume. In one sense, this is the real manifestation of the “people-to-people exchanges” between Malaysia and China and it should not be feared. Rather, the xin yimin’s potential to contribute to the well-being of Malaysian society and bilateral ties should be harnessed and welcomed. Nonetheless, more efforts to understand and study their potential social, cultural, economic, and even political implications are needed.\n\nENDNOTES\n\n[1] The only work that provides a general picture of the xin yimin in Malaysia is Yao Zhulin, Shengcun yu fazhan: Zhongguo xinyimin zai Malaixiya (Survival and Development: The New Chinese Migrants in Malaysia), (Master Thesis, Xiamen University, 2007).\n\n[2] According to Malaysia’s National Registration Department, from 2018 to 2019, only 37 persons from China were granted citizenship.

    "Malaysia’s institutional uncertainty": "Author: William Case, Nottingham University Malaysia\n\nFor nearly half a century, the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) imposed single-party dominance in Malaysia. UMNO’s internal party elections, Malaysia’s general elections and the country’s judicial proceedings are three stand-out mechanisms that helped maintain this dominance. But as their functions have been transfigured, they have become the objects of bitter contention between rival leaders and factions in UMNO.\n\nTraditionally, the UMNO president and vice president refreshed their leadership by standing — usually unchallenged — in party elections. Other aspirants were permitted to contest the lesser vice-presidencies and Supreme Council seats. The UMNO president would then approve party candidates and subordinate coalition partners to wage general elections. While the iterated victories that followed were manipulated, they lent legitimacy to the UMNO president’s claim to the prime ministership and the party’s dominance. UMNO leaders then turned to the courts — usually compliant — for reconciliation or absolution in any later disputes or corruption scandals.\n\nThese patterns, instituted during the mid-1970s, were shattered by UMNO’s loss in the 2018 general election. Mass level resentment towards former UMNO president and prime minister Najib Razak, who had recklessly amassed patronage resources and personal wealth during his tenure, was the main trigger for this defeat. His behaviours, peaking in the notorious 1MDB scandal, involved his channelling some US$700 million of missing state funds to his own bank accounts.\n\nIt was after the UMNO-led government’s displacement by an opposition coalition, Pakatan Harapan, that the linkages between party elections, general elections and judicial proceedings began to unravel. In February 2020, through parliamentary manoeuvring and monarchical interventions, UMNO found its way back into power, though as part of a shaky four-way coalition. Of these parties, UMNO still held the most parliamentary seats. But weakened by electoral defeat and the court cases mounted against Najib over 1MDB, UMNO yielded the prime ministership to Muhyiddin Yassin, the president of the Malaysian United Indigenous Party (Bersatu), UMNO’s nominal ally at the time.\n\nIn its reduced circumstances, UMNO grew factionalised. One group, labelled the ‘old guard’, demanded that UMNO break from Bersatu to reassert its single-party dominance. Another faction called for ongoing power-sharing. UMNO’s old guard centred on Najib who, despite being ensnared in court cases, used his charisma to rekindle his popularity in the Malay–Muslim community. By appealing to the loyalties of UMNO’s parliamentarians and high-level supporters — increasingly forgetful of 1MDB — the old guard succeeded in ousting Muhyiddin.\n\nBut with their image still blighted by court cases, the old guard was unable to lay claim to the prime ministership. In August 2021, they acquiesced in Ismail Sabri Yaakob’s rise to the position, despite him heading the faction that embraced Bersatu and only holding a vice-presidency position in UMNO. This ruptured the long-standing alignment between the top party and government offices. Accordingly, Ismail has often been dismissed as an ‘accidental prime minister’, destined to be shunted aside by the old guard if it is ever fully rehabilitated.\n\nUMNO’s factions skirmished for control over the once trusty medley of party elections, general elections and judicial proceedings. The old guard, in their bid to restore UMNO’s single-party dominance and their place at its helm, succeeded in amending UMNO’s constitution in July 2022 to delay the party election until after the general election. This would enable Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, the incumbent party president and close associate of Najib, to select his favourites as UMNO’s candidates in the general election.\n\nThe old guard also pushed for an immediate general election. Together with candidates from East Malaysia, they sensed victory, even though they had to break from precedent by fabricating a ruling coalition after the election, rather than before. In this institutional sequencing, unprecedented in Malaysia, the old guard might then cement their grip on the party, reinstitute UMNO’s dominance over the state apparatus and stave off judicial proceedings.\n\nMeanwhile, UMNO’s accommodative faction resisted the delay in party elections, hoping that Ismail Sabri might wrest away the presidency and then lead the party, along with Bersatu, in contesting the general election.\n\nGeneral elections in Malaysia have since grown to be more genuinely determinative. Judicial proceedings have followed suit. The courts have shown new willingness to punish leaders for graft. On 23 August 2022, the Federal Court upheld the earlier conviction and sentencing of Najib over charges involving 1MDB. He is now in Kajang prison, emerging only to make court appearances in other 1MDB cases. His wife, Rosmah Mansor, has also been convicted on corruption charges. Ahmad Zahid faces serious charges over corruption too.\n\nIsmail Sabri has been handed a double fillip. The old guard which loomed over him has been diminished. At the same time, in contesting the next general election, which must be held by September 2023, Ismail can appeal to the grievances of Malay-Muslim voters over Najib’s ‘unjust’ fate. On winning the general election, Ismail Sabri would likely rise to UMNO’s presidency in the party election to follow. He might even go on to restore UMNO’s single-party dominance and the rhythms of the trio of institutions that once underpinned it — tamping down electoral competitiveness and judicial independence.\n\nAlternatively, he might still be pushed out by the old guard — which would bring about a similar re-equilibration of institutions. In this scenario, Najib’s return to the prime ministership grows distinctly more imaginable. As a first step, he is now seeking a pardon from the nation’s king.\n\nWilliam Case is Professor and Head of the School of Politics, History and International Relations at the University of Nottingham Malaysia."
