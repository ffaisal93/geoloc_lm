    "Four arrested over alleged plot to kidnap Belgian justice minister": "Police in the Netherlands have arrested four suspects over what Belgium’s justice minister described as a plan to kidnap him.\n\nVincent Van Quickenborne, who is also the mayor of the city of Kortrijk in western Flanders, appeared to blame a “drug mafia” in a video message run by state broadcaster RTBF.\n\nAddressing an audience at a local ball, he said that in a phone call on Thursday, a federal prosecutor had warned him of a kidnap plan targeting him.\n\nOn Saturday Van Quickenborne said: “I will be placed under strict security for the time being and will not be able to participate in some planned activities in the coming days. It’s not pleasant, but understandable.\n\n“Let me be clear: the people behind this are achieving the opposite of what they aim for. It strengthens me in the belief that we need to keep fighting. The criminals feel trapped. That feeling is right. Because we will continue to fight organised crime, with more manpower and resources than before.\n\n“In our democratic rule of law we will never fold to violence. Never.”\n\nFederal prosecutors said on Saturday that police had beefed up security for Van Quickenborne, citing a serious “threat”. They said three people had been detained in the Netherlands and that Belgian authorities were seeking their extradition.\n\nA spokesman for the Dutch prosecutor’s office in the Hague said the trio, all Dutch, were aged 20, 29 and 48. On Sunday, a judicial source said a fourth suspect had been arrested in the Netherlands.\n\nBelgian prime minister Alexander De Croo tweeted on Saturday that the threat to Quickenborne was “totally unacceptable. But it must be clear: we will not be intimidated by anyone. The work continues.”\n\nFollowing a report in the Flemish daily Het Laatste Nieuws, the source confirmed to AFP that an automatic weapon had been found in a vehicle spotted near the minister’s home in Kortrijk. Belgian news outlet VRT reported that the vehicle contained Kalashnikovs, other firearms and two bottles of petrol.\n\nThe prosecutor’s office said it had been informed last week of a “possible threat”, which led to an investigation. It would not provide further details.",

    "Nations League: Denmark stun France while Van Dijk sinks Belgium": "Nations League holders France lost 2-0 to Denmark in their final Group A game but salvaged their place in the top tier at the end of a dismal campaign on Sunday.\n\nDidier Deschamps’ side, who will face Denmark in the World Cup in November, finished third in the Nations League standings with five points from six games after Kasper Dolberg and Andreas Skov Olsen scored first-half goals for the hosts. Austria were relegated to League B after a 3-1 defeat at home to Croatia left them bottom of the group on four points.\n\nCroatia qualified for the final four with 13 points, one ahead of Denmark, who burst into life against France after being dominated in the first 20 minutes. World champions France, who had several first-choice players out injured including Paul Pogba, Karim Benzema and Hugo Lloris, were a far cry from their best and Deschamps will be crossing fingers that all have recovered for the tournament in Qatar.\n\n“We had a lot of chances, but we were not aggressive enough and made several technical mistakes,” Deschamps said. “We had a young team and they don’t have the experience of a high level. Tonight was a reality check. I’m not worried for the World Cup because we’ll get most of our injured players back in time. We don’t however think we’re stronger than the others and we know it’s going to be a big fight.”\n\nCroatia, who needed victory to assure top spot, went ahead through Luka Modric but were pegged back three minutes later. The points were sealed when Marko Livaja headed home at the back post after a cross from Ivan Perisic, before Dejan Lovren was left free by the home defenders to score with a header from Lovro Majer’s cross.\n\nFrance coach Didier Deschamps said he was not worried about their form going into the World Cup Photograph: Fabian Bimmer/Reuters\n\nCaptain Virgil van Dijk netted a second-half winner as the Netherlands beat Belgium 1-0 on Sunday to ensure top spot in their Nations League group and a place in next year’s finals tournament. Van Dijk powered home a header from a corner in the 73rd minute at the Amsterdam Arena to ensure the Dutch finished runaway winners in League A Group Four.\n\nThey finished with 16 points, six more than Belgium who had a chance to leapfrog their neighbours, and take first place, but needed to win by three goals or more on Sunday to do so.\n\nIn Group C1, the Faroe Islands stunned Turkey with a 2-1 home win, although Turkey will still be promoted to League B as group winners, with the Faroes in third place.",
    "Eyes on Belgium as some EU states push for Russian diamond ban": "FILE PHOTO: Diamonds are pictured during an official presentation by diamond producer Alrosa in Moscow, Russia Ferbuary 13, 2019. REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov/File Photo\n\nBy Gabriela Baczynska and Philip Blenkinsop\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) – The European Union must stop importing diamonds from Russia, five of the bloc’s 27 countries said in a joint proposal seen by Reuters, as the EU prepares new sanctions against Moscow for waging war against Ukraine.\n\nThe EU, which has so far implemented six rounds of sanctions since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, needs unanimity to agree any such ban that Belgium – home to the world’s biggest diamond trading hub Antwerp – has rejected in the past.\n\nThe bloc was spurred into fresh action after President Vladimir Putin ordered a partial military mobilisation last week and moved to annex parts of eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe EU’s executive European Commission is expected to present a formal proposal for more sanctions to member states this week.\n\nPoland, Ireland, Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia proposed introducing a retaliatory ban on imports of diamonds from Russia, where Alrosa is the world’s largest producer of rough gems.\n\nThe Antwerp World Diamond Centre said sanctions would take away some 30% of business and benefit rival trade hubs, adding clients should be allowed to decide themselves if they wanted Russian gems.\n\nBelgium’s foreign ministry and the diplomatic representation to the EU did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nBut on Sept. 14, Prime Minister Alexander de Croo told an international diamonds conference that such a ban would be a “huge loss” and would hurt an industry accounting for 5% of Belgium’s exports and supporting some 30,000 jobs.\n\nAn EU official and a diplomat involved in preparations of new measures against Russia said, however, that Belgium was now expected to lift its veto.\n\nFollowing the Commission’s proposal on new sanctions, diplomats and ministers will negotiate until they reach consensus, failing which the matter goes to the 27 national leaders when they meet in Prague on Oct.6-7.\n\n(Writing by Gabriela Baczynska; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise)",
    "Copy Cats Belgium make the Quarter-Finals again after best ever run": "SYDNEY (Australia) - After making the FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup Semi-Finals on their 2018 debut, the Belgian Cats are eyeing up a repeat after making the Quarter-Finals in Sydney.\n\n\"It feels good because sometimes I think that we forget that we're small Belgium and that is only our second Women's World Cup. I think it's something we can be proud of.\"\n\nThey booked their spot with a commanding 85-55 success against Bosnia and Herzegovina as they also won three games in a row in the competition for the first time in their short history.\n\nHaving lost their opener against USA, they followed up victories against Korea and Puerto Rico by brushing aside their European rivals thanks mainly to Hind Ben Abdelkader and Kyara Linskens. The former fired 18 points and Linskens returned 13 points and 7 rebounds. Meanwhile Julie Allemand also handed out 9 assists.\n\nThis is the second Quarter-Finals appearance in as many Women's World Cup appearances for Belgium an impressive accomplishment that is not lost upon one of the team's leader Julie Allemand.\n\n\"It feels good because sometimes I think that we forget that we're small Belgium and that is only our second Women's World Cup. I think it's something we can be proud of. Sometimes it's like 'Oh, this is normal' but it's not!

    "Belgium Business Confidence Plunged in September": "By Maria Martinez\n\nBusiness confidence in Belgium fell sharply in September, declining for the fifth consecutive month amid higher energy prices and weaker demand.\n\nThe business confidence index fell to minus 11.8 in September from minus 5.8 in August, data from the National Bank of Belgium showed Monday. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal expected the indicator to come in at minus 8.8.\n\nThe acute deterioration in the business climate is affecting all sectors of activity covered by the survey, with the exception of the building industry, with the indicator remaining virtually stable, the Bank of Belgium said.\n\nThe loss of confidence was particularly abrupt in the retail sector, with its indicator falling to minus 24.1 in September from minus 11.9 in August. Demand forecasts collapsed and those for orders placed with suppliers fell again.\n\nDemand forecasts in the manufacturing industry were considerably weaker as well. The indicator for this sector declined to minus 13.9 from minus 7.2 in the previous month.\n\nThe economic climate in the services sector is also suffering from much more unfavorable forecasts concerning both firms' own activity and general market demand. The indicator for the sector deteriorated to minus 4.5 in September from 2.1 in August.\n\nIn the building industry, the indicator remained more or less stable, falling to minus 6.0 from minus 5.6, with demand forecasts even improving. However, business leaders were less optimistic about the level of their order books.\n\nWrite to Maria Martinez at maria.martinez@wsj.com",
    "Dutch coach Van Gaal insists side will beat Belgium": "Louis van Gaal insisted the Netherlands would beat neighbours Belgium on Sunday to secure top spot in their Nations League group and go into the World Cup unbeaten since he took over as coach.\n\nThe Dutch have a three-point lead at the head of League A Group Four and will win the group as long as they avoid a heavy defeat to Belgium at the Amsterdam Arena on Sunday.\n\n“We’re going to win tomorrow. Better to go to the World Cup undefeated than to lose the last game. That’s what I told the boys,” Van Gaal told a news conference on Saturday.\n\nBelgium, who lost 4-1 to the Dutch in Brussels in June, must win by three goals to snatch top place and advance to next June’s finals tournament.\n\n“If that happens, it will be deserved,” said Van Gaal.\n\n“But I believe in my players and that they will win it. That’s how I prepare them. I don’t expect an upset. My players are always focused and that’s why I always tell them the line-up two days in advance so that they can focus.”\n\nThe Netherlands coach said he did not expect much different from Belgium. “We’ve analysed them and I see a team that always plays with the same concept of the game. I can’t see that Belgium is suddenly doing something different.”\n\nBut he said he was pleased that the Dutch would get a tough test in their last international before the World Cup in Qatar, where they are in Group A with the hosts, Ecuador and Senegal.\n\n“I prefer to play against these kinds of opponents. I am incredibly happy because there are players of the highest quality playing for Belgium,” he said.\n\n“I’ve often said that I think Kevin De Bruyne is fantastic. He dictates the game and also scores goals. How are we going to tackle that? And how do my players react? That is going to be good to see.\n\n“And then there’s the rivalry,” he added. “I think it’s fantastic to play against the Belgians. I’ve mentioned De Bruyne, but they have more. But then so have we.”\n\nIf the Dutch win on Sunday, it will be Van Gaal’s 37th victory in 58 matches in charge and equal Dick Advocaat’s record as the Dutch coach with the most successes.\n\nVan Gaal, 71, has not lost in 14 games since returning for a third spell as Dutch coach last year.",
    "Belgium 2-1 Wales: Nations League – as it happened": "4d ago 16.55 Kevin De Bruyne talks to S4C, and isn’t particularly impressed with the suggestion that Wales made Belgium defend a lot during the second half. “I think we fully deserved to win. The first half we fully dominated, created a lot of chances. The second half we started badly. The only thing from our side is that we had to keep the ball, Wales were so deep, we had to wait for the right moment. That was the only thing that could have got better, but I never had the feeling that Wales were going to press us. I saw two chances for Wales, I don’t know what everyone else saw, but it is what it is.” As for the overturned penalty decision? “I was already running to the corner, but even then the rules are so stupid, because it was just a normal corner [and not a drop ball].”\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.48 Brennan Johnson talks to S4C: “It was a game of two halves. In the first, we lacked a lot of belief, we didn’t know how good we could be on this night, and especially what we could bring going forward. We didn’t show any of that. In the second half we came out with a different mentality and did ourselves proud. Rob Page told us to believe ourselves, to show why we’re here, and I think we did that. Poland is a massive game to stay in this league. It’ll be a really big game and we’ll all be ready for it.”\n\nUpdated at 16.48 EDT\n\n4d ago 16.46 The other result in Group A4: Poland 0-2 Netherlands. Goals from Cody Gakpo and Steven Bergwijn have given the Dutch all three points in Warsaw. They remain top of the group with 13 points, three clear of Belgium on 10. Wales are still bottom with just the one point, but they’re only three behind the Poles, who visit Cardiff on Sunday. They’re not down and out yet.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.41 FULL TIME: Belgium 2-1 Wales The whistle sounds on a deserved victory for Belgium … but Wales will be very happy with their second-half performance. They’d been given the runaround in the first half, but stood firm in the second, and could easily have snatched a draw.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.40 90 min +6: … but the long ball goes straight down Courtois’ throat.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.39 90 min +5: Martinez swans down the tunnel wearing a wry smile. If nothing else, from the stand, he’ll have a good look at Williams launching a Hail Mary from the halfway line …\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.38 90 min +4: Mertens finally takes it. Wales clear and launch a counter through Johnson down the right. Meunier comes across with a crunch tackle, just as it looks like Johnson would sprint clear. On the touchline, Roberto Martinez deliberately throws the ball away to waste time, and is sent off!\n\nUpdated at 16.45 EDT\n\n4d ago 16.36 90 min +3: Trossard wins a corner down the left. Mertens is in no rush to take it.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.35 90 min +2: De Bruyne, amazing in the first half, not so eye-catching in the second, makes way for De Ketelaere.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.34 90 min +1: Meunier has a dig from distance. Always wide right, always high.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.34 90 min: Johnson makes good down the right again, like he did for the Welsh goal. His fierce cross is tipped away from the danger zone by Courtois. Wales are pushing for a sensational equaliser, and they’ll have another six minutes in which to find one!\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.33 89 min: Bale shimmies down the left and backheels for Williams, who sends a powerful low fizzer towards goal. Courtois parries well and the hosts clear their lines.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.31 88 min: Trossard runs at Wales again and lays off for Vanaken, who slips a pass down the left for Mertens. He shapes a curler towards the top right … but it’s always curling the wrong way. Well wide.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.30 86 min: Mertens whips a cross in from the left. Mepham, bravely sliding to block, takes one in the swingers. After taking a few deep breaths and an inventory, he’s back up and running.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.29 85 min: Williams crosses from the left. Connor Roberts cushions a header down at the far stick. Johnson drags a shot wide left from 12 yards. Had that been on target, tucked into the corner, Courtois was never getting it. Not a gilt-edged chance, but a chance nonetheless.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.27 84 min: Tyler Roberts comes on for Norrington-Davies, as Wales opt to go for it with time running out.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.27 83 min: The home crowd weren’t too happy with the overturned decision, as you’d imagine. Now they’ve howled themselves out, it’s the Welsh travelling support making the most noise.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.26 81 min: Good old VAR, huh. That was a ridiculous penalty decision. We play on.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.25 VAR: No penalty! 79 min: VAR has a look, and justice is done. Morrell clearly toed the ball out of play, and De Bruyne then went over his outstretched leg. It’ll be a drop ball, and not a corner, while it turns out Bale was booked for arguing the toss. Surely that will be rescinded. Morrell’s yellow too, else he’ll miss the Poland game.\n\nUpdated at 16.50 EDT\n\n4d ago 16.22 Penalty for Belgium! 77 min: Belgium ping it around patiently. Suddenly Meunier rolls a pass down the right for De Bruyne, who strides into the box. Morrell sticks out a toe and pokes out for a corner. De Bruyne goes over, the referee points to the spot, and Wales are incensed! Morrell is also booked.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.19 75 min: For the second time in as many minutes, Trossard embarks on a dangerous dribble down the middle of the park. The Brighton midfielder has been lively since coming on.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.17 73 min: Johnson tears towards the Belgian box and slips James into space on his right. James one-twos with Morrell and dinks to the far post, where Vertonghen is forced to head behind for a corner. Nothing comes of the set piece, but Wales are asking a few questions now.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.14 71 min: Free kick for Belgium out on the left. De Bruyne takes. Wales deal with it easily. The hosts haven’t been half as dangerous in this second half. All credit to Wales for making a match of this.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.13 69 min: James curls a cross in from the left. Bale gets in ahead of Alderweireld and heads goalwards. The ball flicks off the defender and out for a corner, at which James showcases his slapstick skills, slipping over onto all fours under no pressure, then getting up to needlessly barge Openda, shepherding the loose ball out of play, to the floor from behind. Goal kick.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.10 67 min: The presence of Meunier down the right forces Williams into conceding a corner. De Bruyne curls it in. Alderweireld slaps a sidefoot way over the bar.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.09 66 min: Belgium respond with a triple change. Batshuayi, Hazard and Carrasco are replaced by Openda, Mertens and Trossard.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.08 65 min: Wales make a double change. Off go Moore and Smith, on come Morrell and – to loud cheers of appreciation – Bale.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.05 61 min: De Bruyne takes the free kick. It’s an over-elaborate training-ground routine that ends with Tielemans taking a long-distance potshot that’s deflected out for a corner. Nothing comes of it.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.04 60 min: Some pre-free-kick faffing, as Moore goes down to get the physio to take a look at his arm. Ian Burch helps us to kill some time: “Batshuayi now finally free from the graveyard of strikers which is Stamford Bridge where in truth he wasted six years of his life as well as ours. Hapless in front of goal, frequently offside and short of confidence, he looked every inch a Chelsea centre forward. He’ll be remembered for his title-clinching goal late on at West Brom, but even then he managed to upset the travelling support by running to the wrong corner of the ground to celebrate, well his sense of direction was never very good. He’ll never been forgiven for doing that.”\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.02 58 min: Hazard dribbles down the middle of the park with purpose, and is hauled back by Ampadu. Another booking, and another player who’ll miss the Poland game on Sunday.\n\n\n\n4d ago 16.00 56 min: Belgium ping a few triangles. Vertonghen fires a low cross into the six-yard box from the left. Ampadu is on hand to hook clear.\n\n\n\n4d ago 15.58 54 min: De Bruyne makes ground down the right and chips into the Welsh box. Some head tennis. Wales are defending desperately when Meunier bumbles onto the scene and witlessly clatters Apmadu on the edge of the box. A completely pointless challenge. The pressure on Wales released.\n\n\n\n4d ago 15.57 53 min: Belgium will be wondering how they’re just a goal ahead. But here we suddenly are. The hosts attempt to rediscover their equilibrium with some patient midfield passing.\n\n\n\n4d ago 15.55 52 min: That was a superb run by Johnson, who is a prospect all right. Moore could hardly miss, so good was the cross, though take nothing away from a perfectly placed header.\n\n\n\n4d ago 15.54 GOAL! Belgium 2-1 Wales (Moore 50) Now then! Now then! Johnson dribbles down the right. He takes on both Witzel and Carrasco, dropping a shoulder to advance towards the byline. He stands one up to the far post, where Moore rises highest, planting an unstoppable downward header past Courtois. Game on!\n\n\n\n4d ago 15.53 49 min: Mepham is awarded the first yellow card of the evening for unceremoniously clattering into the back of Hazard. He’ll now miss the home fixture against Poland on Sunday.\n\nUpdated at 15.53 EDT\n\n4d ago 15.52 48 min: Tielemans shovels a diagonal pass towards Carrasco, just inside the Welsh box on the left. Carrasco takes the ball down, thinks about shooting, but tries to tee up Hazard instead. Wrong choice. Wales clear their lines.\n\n\n\n4d ago 15.50 47 min: A slow start to the second half. Nobody seems in too much of a mood to push things.\n\n\n\n4d ago 15.35 HALF TIME: Belgium 2-0 Wales Wales have looked half-decent in attack, but otherwise they’ve been very much second best. Belgium could easily have had a few more. They’ve been magnificent. Here’s Peter Oh: “I’m afraid even a rousing half-time speech by Michael Sheen himself won’t fix this one.”\n\n\n\n4d ago 15.33 45 min: Roberts races down the right and wins a corner. Could Wales grab something that could totally alter the momentum of this game? Well, nearly. The corner gets all the way through to Williams on the left. He’s got time to trap and shape a shot towards the top right. Unfortunately it pings off Norrington-Davies’s shoulder and over for a goal kick.\n\n\n\n4d ago 15.31 44 min: Nothing comes of that corner either. Wales could do with half time.\n\n\n\n4d ago 15.31 43 min: Nothing comes of the corner, which is half cleared. Hazard comes back at Wales and wins another.\n\n\n\n4d ago 15.30 42 min: Belgium, unruffled, go back up the other end and continue to probe. Suddenly Tielemans creams a long pass up the right flank. De Bruyne strides towards the box and threads a shot towards the bottom left. It’s heading in, but Hennessey sticks out a boot to deflect it wide of the post.\n\n",

    "Ghent is Belgium’s unsung capital of cool": "Listen 14 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nThe sun beat down on Ghent. It was the hottest day I could remember ever spending in Belgium, and it was a relief to be on the water. I paddled the canoe through the confluence of the Lys and Scheldt rivers. The voices of sunbathers carried from the quay, where moored houseboats bobbed beneath gabled houses and planters popping with pink flowers. But I didn’t dwell on Ghent’s undeniable charm. Instead, I watched the water … until I saw it up ahead, partially submerged: a plastic bottle, riding the currents on its way to the North Sea. I extended my trash-grabber and snatched it.\n\nOver the years, I keep returning to Belgium’s second city. Once I made a pilgrimage to see a world-famous masterpiece, Van Eyck’s “Adoration of the Mystic Lamb,” also called the Ghent Altarpiece. (It’s also known as the most stolen painting in history, but more on that later.) The city’s energy was so irresistible that I’d returned to survey the happening restaurant scene with a friend from Brussels. On each successive trip, I’ve been amazed that Ghent — just about half an hour by train from Bruges and Brussels, and about an hour from Antwerp — isn’t overrun with tourists. Most recently, I wanted to dive into Ghent’s green ethos. Beyond its cool vibe, the city has been making waves for its sustainability initiatives and eco-minded tourism strategy.\n\nSo I boarded a boat by DOKano. The idea behind this nonprofit: Rent a canoe for the price of a bucket of trash that you retrieve yourself from Ghent’s waterways. (A donation is also welcome.) What started in 2017 as the brainchild of five parents at school pickup has morphed into an organization that’s popular with both locals and visitors. DOKano also offers team-building outings and educational excursions with school groups, who are encouraged to sort the trash before nominating the “catch of the day.” Some of the more curious finds? A toy monkey, sneakers and perfectly usable heart-shaped luggage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“DOKano’s mission is to take action with as many people as possible to create plastic-free waters,” says co-founder Hans Marly. “The goal is to remove litter while raising public awareness of the problem.”\n\nThe plight of plastic in our environment can be depressing. For me, going canoeing with DOKano was a means of exploring the beautiful waterways while doing something proactive. “Projects like this are positive for both tourists and locals and reflect the city’s goals,” says Deputy Mayor Bram Van Braeckevelt. “We aim to keep tourism in Ghent sustainable — to find a balance with the city’s livability, to invest in projects that provide a return to the local community, to take measures to avoid overtourism in the future.”\n\nThe rebellious noose bearers\n\nGhent’s vibrant spirit and political engagement stem from its history. The story is told with flair at STAM, the Ghent City Museum, whose very architecture — an amalgam of restored medieval cloisters and contemporary glass — reflects the modern city itself. Back around 630, a wandering French missionary named Amandus arrived to proselytize the local population, building a church that later became St. Bavo’s Abbey. Ghent grew into a medieval powerhouse thanks to the cloth trade. In the oldest written description of Ghent (1154), geographer al-Sharif al-Idrisi waxed poetic in Arabic: “It is a beautiful, flourishing city with many stately homes and grand vistas. It possesses gardens, orchards and fields that provide a continual harvest.”\n\nIn the Middle Ages, Ghent was the second-largest city in northern Europe after Paris. This prosperous trade hub even boasted its own army, with which it challenged the Counts of Flanders and Dukes of Burgundy. Over time, the creation of craft guilds — each demanding political participation — encouraged diplomacy and the exchange of ideas.\n\n“Ghent has always had a rebellious streak,” says Luk Darras, a former Belgian ambassador who has lived here for 17 years, referring to an infamous 16th-century episode. Charles V, the future Holy Roman Emperor, was born in Ghent but later squashed a revolt, forcing the locals to parade through the streets wearing hangman’s nooses around their necks in punishment. To this day, Ghentians are called “stroppendragers” (or noose bearers), and you can find a noose proudly depicted on a local beer label.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, the population numbers more than 265,000 people of about 160 nationalities, with approximately an additional 85,000 university students arriving each autumn. “It brings an injection of youthful energy,” says Mieke Thienpont, a professional guide and president of the Ghent Guides association.\n\n“The city is very much alive,” Darras says. “It’s friendly and dynamic — open to industry and change — and also socially engaged.”\n\nGhent’s heritage is reason enough to travel here. There’s the formidable Castle of the Counts, the 15th-century Great Butchers’ Hall, the UNESCO-listed belfry lording over it all. Founded in 1235, the Beguinage of Our Lady at Hoyen — also a UNESCO site — once housed religious women in a unique, self-sustaining community. Guildhalls with ornately sculpted facades flank the quays of Graslei and Korenlei. The Museum of Fine Arts (MSK), considered Belgium’s oldest museum, is celebrating its 225th anniversary with a rich program. And back to the aforementioned Ghent Altarpiece, of which Darras says is “the one painting you have to see in your life,” a visitor center inside St. Bavo’s Cathedral brings the newly restored work to life through an augmented-reality experience that’s an immersion in the Van Eyck brothers’ world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut besides all this cultural wealth, it’s the energy and ambiance that keep luring me back. As I walked Ghent’s cobblestoned streets, I fed off the laughter from the busy cafes, the rush of commuting bikes, a flamenco concert at ENTR, where I nursed a local Lousberg beer. Admiring the city’s prolific street art, I met local legend Klaas Van der Linden as he painted a wall on Graffiti Street. His works are all over Ghent; for example, the astonishing “Lost at Sea” is an enormous self-portrait in exuberant color. He has a master’s degree in arts, though he learned spray-paint techniques on the streets, and his paintings are exhibited in shows across Europe. A crowd had gathered to snap photos, and Van der Linden was gregarious, inviting some passersby to check out his studio: a medieval cellar with vaulted ceilings that’s quintessentially Ghent.\n\nIt’s this authenticity that the city champions (and promotes through measures such as the “Walk Local” campaign, showing where famous residents hang out to entice visitors away from the city’s Instagrammable historical center). “Ghent is so much more than just a selfie,” Van Braeckevelt says. “We invite people to bring their pajamas and stay overnight — to feel the city’s vibe like Ghentians.”\n\nWhen I checked into the Yalo Urban Boutique Hotel, opened in 2021, I found a buzzing hangout with great energy. It draws locals for coffee and co-working in the morning (the coffee is by a neighborhood roastery called Vandekerckhove), after-work cocktails in the bar (try “Lucifer’s Kiss,” with jalapeño-infused Pisco), and dinner in the glass-roofed atrium (served by friendly waiters wearing white Puma sneakers). A soon-to-open rooftop will no doubt attract the cool crowd for DJ sets with a panoramic view. There’s a real focus on design here, along with sustainability. As Belgium’s second hotel with Green Globe certification, its eco-friendly measures include solar-heated water, upcycled glasses by Belgian company IWAS and kitchen ingredients sourced from local farms.\n\nRevolutionary creativity\n\nA playground for artists, Ghent is fertile ground for experimental ideas, particularly in sustainability. Most recently, the city’s tourism recovery plan, launched in 2021 with a green focus, was the result of diplomacy and compromise. To determine the future of tourism, local residents were engaged alongside business managers in citywide debates.\n\nOther examples abound. The Ghent Light Plan was launched in 2007 as a means of illuminating the city’s monuments and buildings at night in a dazzling yet energy-efficient way. Cycling culture is pervasive, boosted by infrastructure (such as bike parking garages) and city incentives. A low-emission zone was established in January 2020 to keep polluting cars out of the city center. In fact, many locals have ditched their cars in exchange for bikes or community car-sharing services. Ghent was the first Belgian city to launch Fairbnb, the sustainable vacation rental platform that reinvests 50 percent of its revenue in local communities. But perhaps the biggest example of pioneering initiatives: In 2009, Ghent witnessed the launch of “Thursday Veggie Day,” now a global phenomenon that encourages people to skip meat for a day to help fight climate change. Ghent is today a vegetarian capital with a variety of restaurants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We couldn’t have launched anywhere else but Ghent,” says Paul Florizoone, who founded the trendsetting Greenway brand 26 years ago. Before vegetarianism went mainstream, Greenway innovated with meat alternatives, and today, alongside its three restaurants in Belgium, it offers a range of retail products, such as sausage made from locally grown cauliflower and cordon bleu from celeriac. Newer to the scene is Epiphany’s Kitchen, a lively spot named Belgium’s best vegan restaurant by BE Vegan in 2021. You won’t find avocado toast on the menu. The dishes are the result of creative kitchen experimentation — such as the pizza crust made from crushed yuca root — which you can taste among flickering candles and a riot of flowers. Everything is made in-house. “It was a success since the beginning, and I didn’t initially market it as vegan,” explains owner Epiphany Vanderhaeghen. “I wanted to invite people into my world to experience it.”\n\nOn my last night, I sat at the bar at Publiek, a Michelin-starred restaurant with a real cool factor. Chef Olly Ceulenaere is a champion of the Flemish terroir, reputed for exalting local products (whether that be endives, Bintje potatoes or North Sea fish) in refined cuisine that’s also accessible. Appetizing smells wafted from the open kitchen while I slurped an oyster topped with berry-infused granitas, washed down with a rhubarb and raspberry beer. The ambiance is fun and relaxed — the non-harried waiters open to chatting — and it struck me that, with its laid-back style, the restaurant captures the spirit of Ghent. Tipped off by the waiter, I tried the Dame Blanche, a dessert that’s not on the menu. It’s a seemingly simple classic: vanilla ice cream made fresh when you order, accompanied by warm choux pastry and cups of melted chocolate and whipped cream. But it’s sublime because of the quality of the ingredients.\n\n“I want people to have a good time,” Ceulenaere says. “I run the restaurant to be a place where I would want to eat.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was late when I left the restaurant. But the buildings were aglow, the streets humming with cyclists on their way home from a night out. I resolved to return for one of the city’s epic festivals; during the Ghent Light Festival, the gilded dragon that’s perched atop the belfry even spits fire — a fitting mascot for such a spirited place. A light rain began to fall as I followed De Reep, the same waterway I had earlier traversed by canoe. Then the skies above Ghent crackled with the electricity of a thunderstorm.\n\nWinston Nicklin is a writer based in Paris. Her website is marywinstonnicklin.com.

    "Report: England MU18s 2-1 Belgium": "A well-worked move saw Belgium create their best chance of breaking the deadlock ten minutes before the interval when Manchester City stopper True Grant, son of former Derby, Burnley, and Manchester United goalkeeper Lee, had to make a fine save to keep the scores level.\n\nBut the Young Lions responded well after the break and came out of the blocks refreshed in the second half – having two efforts in two minutes.\n\nThe first chance in particular showed England’s ability to move the ball incisively and with purpose. Ndala, who switched to the left flank to get at the Belgium defence, picked out Arsenal’s Amario Cozier-Duberry on the right but he could only shoot straight at the goalkeeper.\n\nA fast-paced beginning to the second half continued when Belgium had a huge chance to take the lead, but Fofana was unable to stretch enough to make clean contact from six yards after the ball was flashed in low from the left by Idumbo Muzambo.\n\nA frantic five minutes then ensued, with Grant having to make a crucial double save – first low to his right and then high to his left as England were put on the backfoot.\n\nAnd after 68 minutes, an unfortunate breakdown in communication between Grant and captain Josh Feeney (pictured above) led to the defender heading backwards over his oncoming goalkeeper and into an empty net to give Belgium the lead.\n\nBut England didn’t let their heads drop and were back level three minutes later as Cozier-Duberry linked up cleverly with Jamie Donley to break into the box and smash the ball home from a tight angle.\n\nGrant, quickly becoming the standout performer on the day, again had to be on his toes to produce another superb stop, this time from point blank range, and again from a low ball across the face of goal from the Belgian left which was stabbed goalward.\n\nIt was to prove crucual, as ten minutes from time substitute Dominic Ballard, scorer of both goals on Friday, got the winner for England as he poked home past Belgium ‘keeper Tom Poitoux.\n\nThe Little Red Devils’ second-half showing was chalk and cheese from their first, but they had two final opportunities to snatch a draw. Firstly, a good run by Enock Agyei saw the ball cut back to Roméo Monticelli on the edge of box but the substitute couldn’t find the net.\n\n\n\nA series of hopeful long balls forward were largely dealt with by the Young Lions, as Belgium looked for one last chance to salvage something.\n\nThat chance came with the final action of the match on 94 minutes, as a Belgian cross from the right was headed on target and destined for the bottom corner, only for Grant to ‘save’ his best until last, as he got down to his left once more and ensured the hard-fought win was England’s.\n\nEngland: 1 True Grant (Manchester City), 2 Jacob Wright (Manchester City), 3 Lino Sousa (Arsenal), 4 Kobbie Mainoo (Manchester United), 5 Tyler Fredricson (Manchester United), 6 Josh Feeney (Aston Villa) (c), 7 Joel Ndala (Manchester City), 8 Jobe Bellingham (Birmingham City), 9 Jamie Donley (Tottenham Hotspur), 10 Nico O’Reilly (Manchester City), 11 Amario Cozier-Duberry (Arsenal).\n\nSubstitutions: 14 Bobby Clark (Liverpool) on for O’Reilly (45’), 21 Kane Taylor (Manchester City) on for Sousa (45’), William Alves (Leicester City) on for Ndala (60’), 23 Sai Sachdev (Sheffield United) on for Wright (60’), 20 Dominic Ballard (Southampton) on for Donley (74’), 16 Leo Castledine (Chelsea) on for Bellingham (77’), 12 Alfie Dorrington (Tottenham Hotspur) on for Fredricson (77’), 15 Harry Whitwell (West Bromwich Albion) on for Mainoo (89’), 18 Samuel Rak-Sakyi (Chelsea) on for Cozier-Duberry (89’), 19 Max Alleyne (Manchester City) on for Feeney (89’).\n\nSubstitutes not used: 13.

    "Russia Arrests More Than 1,300 Anti-Mobilization Protesters": "Russia’s security forces arrested on Wednesday more than 1,300 people who gathered in various cities to protest against the partial mobilization ordered by Vladimir Putin, who upped the ante in the war in Ukraine with the most serious escalation since the invasion in February.\n\nIndependent Russian protest monitoring group OVD-Info says on its front page that 1,314 people were detained on Wednesday during protests against the mobilization of 300,000 reservists which Putin ordered yesterday.\n\nHundreds were arrested at protests – illegal under Russian law – in the capital Moscow and the second-largest city St Petersburg, according to the group.\n\nOn Wednesday, Putin announced in a televised speech an immediate “partial mobilization” of Russia’s military and claims to be ready to defend \"our people\" in the Donbas. Four eastern Ukrainian regions under Russian occupation are set to hold rushed referendums to join the Russian Federation amid continued fighting.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the immediate partial mobilization, one-way flights out of Russia to visa-free destinations for Russians, such as Istanbul in Turkey and Yerevan in Armenia, were sold out in hours.\n\nThe first Russian troop mobilization since World War II sent oil prices surging early on Wednesday on fears that escalation of the war could lead to further isolation and more Western sanctions against Russia, including on its energy exports. Security of energy supply, including of gas, is also a concern with the most recent moves from the Kremlin.\n\nLater on Wednesday, oil prirces pared gains and dropped after the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported a crude oil inventory build of 1.1 million barrels for the week to September 16, as well as inventory increases in gasoline and middle distillates. Hours later, oil extended losses after the Fed announced another rate hike by 75 basis points - the third such large increase in rates in a row. The 75-bp hike was largely expected, but it dragged prices down anyway, due to concerns about the economy and oil demand.\n\nOil opened higher on Thursday amid concerns that an escalation of the war in Ukraine would endanger supply.\n\nBy Charles Kennedy for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",
    "WHO’s Director-General and Minister-President of Wallonia, Belgium, sign framework agreement on the sides of the UNGA": "On the 21st of September, on the sides of the 77th session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, a new framework agreement was signed between the Wallon Government, Belgium and the World Health Organization.\n\nMinister-President of Wallonia, Belgium, Mr Elio Di Rupo met with Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General to further expand the strategic partnership between Wallonia and WHO. The Framework Agreement will, amongst others, facilitate financial contributions to the work of WHO, with a focus on the technical cooperation around health heeds in the priority countries in Africa which are at the center of the efforts of the development cooperation of the Wallon Government.\n\nWith the new agreement, it is expected that joint cooperation around areas of mutual interest, which include immunization, research and policy initiatives, could start as soon as possible.\n\nDr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said: ”WHO is very grateful to have the technical and financial support of Wallonia and we look forward to our collaboration, working together to put in place programmes and policies which can improve the health and lives of people who need it the most”.\n\nMr Elio Di Rupo said: “The signing of this Framework Agreement is a first step in the new cooperation between Wallonia and WHO. Discussions between the two parties will continue in the coming months in order to implement the objectives set out in this agreement through joint action programmes.”\n\nThe agreement focuses on particular areas where the added value of the partnership will make the most impact. To this end, joint action programmes will be developed to support the implementation of public health programs and activities aimed at strengthening the health systems in Africa. For these programmes, it is envisaged to work on vaccine equity and research, as well as the establishment of a health policy in the field of physical medicine and rehabilitation. Other key focus areas include support to the Universal Health Coverage Partnership.",
    "Analysing Belgium's 2022 UCI Road World Championships teams": "Ahead of the 2022 UCI Road World Championships, Cyclingnews is taking a deep dive into the key teams for the elite road races. Here, we put Belgium under the microscope.\n\nHistory\n\nBelgium is the most successful nation in men's road race history at the UCI Road World Championships. They've amassed 26 rainbow jerseys, while on the women's side they are the fourth-most successful nation with six wins.\n\nHowever, the past two decades have been relatively barren for the Belgian teams, with only two gold medals and a total of five since the turn of the Millennium. Long gone are the dominant years of Rik Van Steenbergen, Rik Van Looy, Eddy Merckx, and Freddy Maertens.\n\nOn the women's side, meanwhile, the cupboard is barer still. They haven't collected a medal since 1982 and there hasn't been a rainbow jersey since Nicole Van den Broeck's triumphant ride in Barcelona nine years before that. Two-thirds of their rainbow jerseys came via Nicole Reynders between 1959 and 1966.\n\nThe Belgian men's last three medals have been spread out across 16 years, which is some achievement given the depth of talent the country has turned out in that time. Philippe Gilbert's win in Valkenburg a decade ago counts as their most recent victory.\n\nLine-up\n\nMen elite\n\nWout van Aert (Jumbo-Visma)\n\nStan Dewulf (AG2R Citroën)\n\nRemco Evenepoel (QuickStep-AlphaVinyl)\n\nQuinten Hermans (Intermarché-Wanty-Gobert)\n\nYves Lampaert (QuickStep-AlphaVinyl)\n\nPieter Serry (QuickStep-AlphaVinyl)\n\nJasper Stuyven (Trek-Segafredo)\n\nNathan Van Hooydonck (Jumbo-Visma)\n\nWomen elite\n\nLotte Kopecky (SD Worx)\n\nValerie Demey (Liv Racing Xstra)\n\nJulie De Wilde (Plantur-Pura)\n\nJustine Ghekiere (Plantur-Pura)\n\nJesse Vandenbulcke (Le Col-Wahoo)\n\nJulie Van de Velde (Plantur-Pura)\n\nKey riders\n\nVan Aert and Evenepoel will be hoping to avoid a repeat of the 2021 road race fall-out (Image credit: Tim de WaeleGetty Images)\n\nMen\n\nFew other nations in the peloton can boast a squad of left-behind riders which could feasibly compete as a standalone team in Wollongong, but Belgium have seen fit to leave a plethora of notable names back home.\n\nClassics men Greg Van Avermaet, Dylan Teuns, Tim Wellens, Oliver Naesen and Victor Campenaerts join climbers Mauri Vansevenant and Ilan Van Wilder – plus sprinters Tim Merlier, Jasper Philipsen and Arnaud De Lie – in all missing the cut for the final eight-man selection.\n\nHeading up that group in Australia, though, is one of the top favourites for the rainbow jersey in Wout van Aert. The 28-year-old has once again been one of the best riders in the world this season and will be racing to plug a rare gap in his palmarès on Sunday.\n\nHe can win from large groups, reduced sprints, solo moves, and can last over the hills as well – a perfect combination of strengths for the tough hilly finishing circuit. He's in great form, too – the past month has seen him win the Bretagne Classic, take second at the Bemer Cyclassics and GP de Montréal, and finish fourth in the GP de Quebéc. It will take some doing to get the better of Van Aert.\n\nFresh Vuelta a España champion Remco Evenepoel is his main lieutenant, with the pair hopefully avoiding a fall-out that tarnished their home Worlds last time out. The 22-year-old has stepped up several levels this season with Liège-Bastogne-Liège another new addition to his palmarès. If he races for the team and avoids getting caught up in media spats, he'll be a key cog in the potential victory machine.\n\nNext in line is Jasper Stuyven, a man who was inches away from a medal in his hometown of Leuven last year – yep, such is Belgium's strength in depth. The 30-year-old is a top calibre Classics man but with the harsh hills on the menu throughout the day he's likely to serve firmly in a team helper role.\n\nQuickStep-AlphaVinyl strongman Yves Lampaert is another Classics specialist who will be flogging himself at the service of his leaders, while Quinten Hermans – who last month said he wasn't expecting a call-up – is a dangerous option to have in reserve on the hilly course.\n\nKopecky won in Belgian colours on home ground at the Tour of Flanders – can she do it in Australia? (Image credit: Bas CzerwinskiGetty Images)\n\nWomen\n\nWhile the men's team have an overall favourite and a couple of other options should things go south for Van Aert, for the women it's all about Lotte Kopecky if they're to take the rainbow jersey for the first time in almost half a century.\n\nIn recent seasons, the 26-year-old has done little but improve, to the point where she's enjoyed the best campaign of her career in 2022. She may not have won since her June national time trial title, but spring saw Kopecky take glory at Strade Bianche and the Tour of Flanders in addition to a second place at Paris-Roubaix.\n\nAs evidenced by her victory over fellow Worlds favourite Annemiek van Vleuten in Siena back in March, she has evolved far beyond the rider she was in seasons past and represents Belgium's best chance at victory in the women's race in years, even if her participation had initially looked in doubt following a hard Tour de France Femmes.\n\nOf Kopecky's five helpers in Australia, none are serious threats to win or medal as Evenepoel or Stuyven could be. The team will be dedicated to helping her break their country's lean spell in the race. Teen talent Julie De Wilde is the next-strongest woman in the squad, the 19-year-old having put in several impressive rides throughout 2022.\n\nShe recently headed up a Plantur-Pura podium sweep at the women's GP de Wallonie and was second at Dwars door Vlaanderen back in March. It won't be her year this time around but she's certainly a rider to take note of for the future.\n\nStrengths\n\nMen\n\nThe strength of the men's squad comes through their depth, with perhaps only the French squad their equal in that regard. Year after year, others look to the Belgians to take control of the race, and that is unlikely to change on Sunday.\n\nFew other nations can boast a series of helpers like Stuyven, Hermans, Lampaert and Van Hooydonck, and fewer still have a one-two punch like Van Aert and Evenepoel.\n\nIt looks like it will take some doing to derail the light blue train in Wollongong, with repeated attacks likely to be the order of the day to disrupt Van Aert's best-laid plans.\n\nKey option Jasper Stuyven took fourth last year in his hometown of Leuven (Image credit: Tim de WaeleGetty Images)\n\nWomen\n\nWhile the Netherlands come to the start of almost every major championship with the strongest squad in the race, it doesn't always translate to the expected glory at the finish. Last year in Leuven and at the Tokyo Olympics things didn't turn out their way despite boasting a plethora of favourites.\n\nAgain, they take the start in Australia in a similar situation, the potential for a muddled tactical race lurking below the surface of the powerhouse squad. For Belgium there will be no such dilemmas or recriminations as Kopecky enjoys sole leadership.\n\nIn a race such as the Worlds, which can be chaotic and unpredictable, there is value in having a defined team structure with a clear leader. Every woman in the Belgian squad will take the start in Helensburgh with a clear role and strategy in their head.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nMen\n\nOne worry among very few for the men's squad is Van Aert's sprint at the end of a long, hard race – assuming he's in the lead group at the finish, of course. While the superstar has shown time and again that he can do it all, there have been several pertinent examples of him just falling short at the final hurdle when he might, on paper, be expected to clean up.\n\nAt the recent GP de Montréal, Van Aert gave a glimpse of how he might be beaten in Wollongong, missing out in the sprint to Tadej Pogačar at the end of a 221km race with over 4,000 metres of elevation – a parcours similar to Sunday's road race.\n\nDespite being one of the best finishers in the world, a worn-down Van Aert won't be a dead-cert to triumph in a finishing sprint even against non-sprinters. It's something to keep in mind if his rivals can't get away from him before the finale.\n\nWomen\n\nWhile the men have a plan B in Evenepoel and even something approaching a plan C or D in Stuyven and Hermans, it's hard to say the same about the women's squad. It's going to be all-in for Kopecky on Saturday, barring a miraculous overperformance from one of her domestiques.\n\nThat's not to do down the squad, though, but not every nation can be like the Netherlands or Italy, those squads blessed with various leadership options. It's worth remembering, though, that in Kopecky they have a real option for victory, which has been a rarity for some time.\n\nConclusions\n\nIt's astounding to look at the list of top riders Belgium have enjoyed in their colours over the years and remember that they haven't taken home an elite road race rainbow jersey in a decade – far longer in the women's case.\n\nNothing is certain at the Worlds, some of the longest days in the saddle all season.

    "Migrant smugglers using private aircrafts grounded in Belgium and Italy": "Supported by Eurojust and Europol, judicial and law enforcement authorities in Austria, Belgium, Germany, France, Italy and the United States dismantled a criminal network involved in migrant smuggling, document fraud and money laundering.\n\n© Belgian authorities\n\nUp to EUR 20 000 for a place in private aircraft\n\nThe migrants, mainly Iraqi and Iranian of Kurdish origin, boarded private aircrafts in Türkiye carrying false diplomatic passports. However, the official destinations of the trips (usually the Caribbean) were never reached. During the stopovers at different European airports, including in Austria, France and Germany, the migrants left the plane, disposed of their false passports and systematically applied for asylum. The suspects charged up to EUR 20 000 per smuggled person.\n\nIt is believed that, between October and December 2020, at least five smuggling operations took place in five different European countries. In addition, several plans were made to carry out other smuggling operations. In addition to migrant smuggling and forging identity documents, the organised crime group is also suspected of issuing false checks and scamming airlines in an attempt to build its own fleet. The suspects also allegedly defrauded hotels by not paying the invoices.\n\nThe action day on 13 September led to:\n\n5 arrests (2 in Belgium and 3 in Italy)\n\n7 house searches (1 in Belgium and 6 in Italy)\n\nSeizures of 2 aircrafts, EUR 80 000 EUR cash, 1 high–end car, electronic equipment and equipment to forge ID documents (card printers, stamps, holograms and white plastic cards)\n\nEUR 173 000 EUR frozen in Italy\n\nEurojust supported the authorities involved with the setting up and funding of a joint investigation team (JIT) in June 2021. The Agency also hosted four coordination meetings to facilitate judicial cooperation and provide support for the coordinated investigative efforts.\n\nEuropol prioritised the case at an early stage, assigning a dedicated analyst and specialist to support the national investigations to identify the members of the criminal network and to dismantle it. Europol facilitated the operational information exchange and provided analytical and financial support. On the action day, Europol activated a Virtual Command Post to facilitate the information exchange in real time. Europol also deployed three analysts – one to Belgium and two to Italy – to cross-check operational information against Europol’s databases and thus provided further investigative leads to the participating national law enforcement authorities.\n\nLaw enforcement authorities involved:\n\nAustria : Criminal Intelligence Service Austria (Bundeskriminalamt), Provincial CID of Tyrol (Landeskriminalamt Tirol) and Schwechat City Command of the Federal Police (Stadtpolizeikommando Schwechat)\n\n: Criminal Intelligence Service Austria (Bundeskriminalamt), Provincial CID of Tyrol (Landeskriminalamt Tirol) and Schwechat City Command of the Federal Police (Stadtpolizeikommando Schwechat) Belgium : Belgian Federal Police (Federale Politie, Police Fédérale), Aviation Police Wevelgem\n\n: Belgian Federal Police (Federale Politie, Police Fédérale), Aviation Police Wevelgem France : French Border Police (OCRIEST/Police Aux Frontières)\n\n: French Border Police (OCRIEST/Police Aux Frontières) Germany : German Federal Police Munich Airport\n\n: German Federal Police Munich Airport Italy : National Police (Polizia di Stato: Servizio Centrale Operativo, Squadra Mobile di Bari e Roma, Servizio di Polizia Scientifica and Ufficio di Polizia di Frontiera di Bari)\n\n: National Police (Polizia di Stato: Servizio Centrale Operativo, Squadra Mobile di Bari e Roma, Servizio di Polizia Scientifica and Ufficio di Polizia di Frontiera di Bari) United States: U.S. Homeland Security Investigations, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Diplomatic Security Service.\n\nJudicial authorities involved:",

A bio-rotor functions as a water purification plant. A bicycle path has also been built. These facilities are intended to help the company reach its target to emit approximately 30% less CO2 by 2030; by 2040, it wants to have reduced its climate gas emissions by 90%.\n\nDPD BeLux now has two international hubs – one in Oirschot in the Netherlands, which serves Northern Europe and the UK, and the new hub in Vilvoorde, which supports Belgium. In Belgium and Luxembourg, DPD BeLux now has one hub and eight depots from which a fleet of over 1,000 vehicles operates. The company provides work for around 1,500 families.\n\nRichard de Haas, CEO of DPD BeLux, said, “Our ambition is to become the international reference for sustainable parcel delivery. We will put even more emphasis on international growth, innovation and the transformation required by the current market. The figures show that e-commerce continues to grow and that the potential of the Belgian and Luxembourg market is significant. During the Covid-19 pandemic, thanks to our strengths in the B2C [business-to-consumer] segment, we had additional opportunities and made our mark on the market. With the new depots and our new hub, we are absolutely ready for the future.”\n\nHans Bonte, the Mayor of Vilvoorde, added, “As a city, we are extremely pleased with the arrival of DPD BeLux. As an important player in the ‘new economy’, the company is fully committed to sustainability and climate-friendly entrepreneurship. Without exaggeration, the new hub can be considered a leader for many other companies in our region. Moreover, the company is a boon to our labor market. On the one hand, Vilvoorde has an exceptionally high number of hard-to-fill vacancies. On the other hand, the city has a high level of structural unemployment among relatively unskilled people. This opportunity makes the situation a win-win situation. In any case, the city council is ready to determine, together with the VDAB [the Flemish Service for Employment and Vocational Training]and DPD, how we can mutually combine our efforts.”",

We need to start sending kids from a young age so that they can follow the style of Europeans and then we can compete with them at any level,\" Ralte said in a release.\n\nAlso known as 'Apui', he talked about his training stint at Lommel SK.\n\n\"Training with Lommel SK in Belgium was a good experience for me. Learning new things with European players and being at the top of the game was a great experience. I gained a lot of knowledge, which is the most important thing for me.\" The Aizawl native described a day in the life of the players at Lommel SK and said, \"The training starts at 10 and ends around 11:30. At 12 they have lunch and then if there is a gym session, we have gym after lunch and later, they go back to their own homes.\" The training stint in Belgium at Lommel SK was an intense experience for the young midfielder as Apuia expressed how fast-paced and gruelling the training was at the Islanders' fellow club from City Football Group.\n\nThe midfielder talked about the main difference between the training at Mumbai City FC and Lommel SK.\n\nAlso Read | AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey: Have to weigh pros and cons regarding promotion-relegation in ISL\n\n\"Training in Belgium was quite difficult since the intensity was high compared to other countries. The main difference was the intensity but the training style was not so different.\" \"...the intensity was so high that you don't have much time on the ball and making quick decisions is a must. I had to adapt to the speed of the game as I was playing one or two touches and making quick decisions.\n\n\"My training at Lommel SK has helped me refine my decision making on the field.\" Apuia also recalled how he fit into the squad. \"It was not too difficult fitting in the squad, but you need some time to fit in on and off the field.

    "Air Belgium to connect Brussels with South Africa and other countries": "LONDON – Air Belgium will be connecting Belgium with countries in southern Africa, such as South Africa, Madagascar, Lesotho, and others.\n\nRoutes\n\nAir Belgium will be flying to South Africa as a seasonal route. Starting September 14th, the airline will be flying every Wednesday and Sunday to Johannesburg, with a continuation flight to Cape Town.\n\nThis route will fly under the 8th freedom of the air, stating that a foreign airline is allowed to fly cabotage flights while starting in its own country.\n\n“This is an exciting and important chapter for Air Belgium“, says Niky Terzakis, CEO of Air Belgium.\n\n“For Brussels Airport, the launch of the South Africa route by Air Belgium marks an important step in the extension of our network of destinations with Cape Town and Johannesburg,” explains Arnaud Feist, CEO of Brussels Airport.\n\n“After no less than 20 years, we are particularly proud that this route is open again. This confirms that Brussels Airport is the right choice for Air Belgium’s long-haul services.”\n\n“We both have a diverse clientele, including Belgian and foreign residents, as well as transfer passengers. We also share a passion for exceptional passenger experience and tailored services.”\n\n“This new destination will be operated with Airbus A330-900neo aircraft, which combine environmental and economic performance with excellent comfort. This aircraft fits perfectly with our commitment to developing a sustainable future for aviation.”\n\nThis route is one of the most important for many Belgians. Belgium and South Africa have a deep economic tie, with a yearly amount of 60,000 passengers flying between South Africa and Belgium, and it is expected to rise up to 80,000 at the end of 2024, according to aviation24.be.\n\nAir Belgium will not only be flying directly to South Africa, but they will also open up a partnership with South Africa’s largest airline, Air Link. Together, they will be offering an incredible amount of destinations to the passengers.\n\nDestinations\n\nThe routes that are flown by Air Belgium and Air Link will be to the following destinations:\n\nSouth Africa: Durban, Bloemfontein, Kimberley, George, Skukuza, Upington, Hoedspruit, Nelspruit, Port Elizabeth, Pietermaritzburg, Mthatha, Sishen, Polokwane, Richards Bay, Cape Town, East London\n\nDemocratic Republic of Congo: Lubumbashi\n\nTanzania: Dar Es Salaam\n\nAngola: Luanda\n\nZimbabwe: Harare, Victoria Falls\n\nNamibia: Windhoek, Walvis Bay\n\nZambia: Lusaka, Ndola, Livingstone\n\nUganda: Entebbe\n\nBotswana: Gabarone, Maun, Kasane\n\nMozambique: Maputo, Vilanculos, Nampula, Pemba, Beira, Tete\n\nLesotho: Moshoeshoe\n\nMadagascar: Antananarivo, Nosy Be\n\n“The social and economic ties between Belgium and South Africa are historic and well established. The historical link between South Africa and Belgium is important, especially considering the importance of Brussels to the European Union.”\n\n“Air access and connectivity in South Africa have seen a watershed moment caused by the COVID pandemic. Airlink is privileged to have survived this change and capitalized on the opportunities that presented themselves.”\n\n“Our reputation is built on our ability to provide exceptional service, unparalleled reliability, on-time flights, and genuine service.”\n\n“Air transport markets are rapidly returning to pre-crisis levels, and there is currently an imbalance between demand and supply, so the timing could not be better for Air Belgium to enter the market with Brussels Airport as a central gateway to Europe, and Johannesburg and Cape Town ensuring reciprocity.”\n\n“It is therefore with great pleasure that we enter into this commercial partnership and welcome Air Belgium to South Africa and Airlink’s comprehensive network of destinations in Southern Africa”, said Rodger Foster, CEO of Airlink.\n\n“We often talk about ‘Belgitude’ and our motto is ‘Fly Belgian Class’, which consists in giving pleasure and comfort to passengers in all travel classes“, says Niky Terzakis.\n\n“And while our travelers appreciate our fun and engaging approach to travel, we also offer them what really matters: a safe and seamless trip, all-inclusive prices including a generous baggage allowance.”\n\n“We also offer travelers an eco-friendly travel option as the Airbus A330neo consumes on average 25% less fuel compared to previous generation aircraft.”\n\n“In terms of comfort, our aircraft offer the best: quieter cabins, adjustable lighting, a state-of-the-art in-flight entertainment system, and Wi-Fi internet connection throughout the flight”.\n\nOverall, this is a big step forward for Air Belgium, especially as the carrier continues its growth strategy overseas.",
    "Belgium’s Catholic Church: shrinking but still influential": "The Catholic Church in Belgium is dominating headlines this week, after bishops issued a text for the blessing of same-sex couples.\n\nBut it’s not only this week that the country has garnered attention in Catholic circles — Belgian Catholicism has long enjoyed considerable influence within the worldwide Church, especially since the Second Vatican Council.\n\nAnd yet Belgium only ranks in 28th place on the list of countries with the largest Catholic populations, behind the Dominican Republic and Kenya.\n\nSo why does the country continue to drive Catholic news? The Pillar takes a look.\n\nCardinal Suenens. Polla ta deina via Wikimedia (CC BY-SA 4.0).\n\nA cardinal, the Council, and co-responsibility\n\nBelgium is not an easy country to understand. For centuries, this strategic strip of land was the “battlefield of Europe.” The nation, which declared its independence from the Netherlands in 1830, is composed of two major ethnic groups: the majority Flemish people, who speak a Dutch dialect, and the minority French-speaking Walloons.\n\nBelgium has a population of 11.5 million and borders the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and France. Its capital, Brussels, is the center of the European Union, a political and economic alliance of 27 member states. The country is relatively prosperous, but outsiders often regard it as deeply culturally divided and its government as dysfunctional, dubbing it “the world’s most successful failed state.”\n\nBelgium also has a bleak colonial legacy: King Leopold II had a reign of terror in the Congo Free State from 1885 to 1908 (inspiring Joseph Conrad’s novel “Heart of Darkness.”) As late as 1958, Belgium hosted a “human zoo,” featuring Congolese men, women and children.\n\nIt is often said there are no famous Belgians, but in fact the country has produced storied saints such as St. John Berchmans and St. Damien of Molokai.\n\nShortly after Belgium gained independence, an important center of Catholic scholarship was established in the city of Leuven/Louvain. (The city’s Catholic university split in the 1960s along linguistic lines, leading to the collapse of the Belgian government.)\n\nThe Belgian Church’s academic prowess proved influential when Pope John XXIII summoned the world’s bishops to Rome for an Ecumenical Council in 1962. Belgian theologians and bishops contributed vigorously to Vatican II’s sessions, none more so than Cardinal Leo Jozef Suenens.\n\nAccording to his New York Times obituary, Suenens helped to influence the Council’s direction when he sent a critique of its preparatory documents to the pope. With John XXIII’s support, the cardinal presented an alternative vision at the Council’s first session. The pope then appointed Suenens to a commission that streamlined the Council’s agenda. Paul VI later named him one of the Council’s four moderators.\n\nThe New York Times described Suenens as a champion of the “modernization of the garb and life style of Catholic nuns, expansion of the laity’s responsibilities, ordination of married men to serve as deacons, mandatory retirement for bishops and renewed ties with other branches of Christianity and with Judaism.”\n\nA few years after Vatican II, Suenens published a widely discussed book arguing that the Vatican was backsliding on the Council’s commitment to “co-responsibility of the laity.”\n\nA funeral Mass in Transinne, Belgium. Lucyin via Wikimedia (CC BY-SA 4.0).\n\nGood works, small congregations\n\nThe annual report produced by the Belgian Church is a colorful, glossy publication running to 100 pages. With its quirky pictures of young people and pages highlighting charitable works, the report suggests that Belgian Catholicism is alive and well.\n\nBut midway through, there is a statistical section. And there, the picture begins to darken. The report notes that 1,261 people asked to be removed from baptismal registers in 2020. That year, 33 parishes were closed and 17 churches fell into disuse (with two given to other Christian communities.)\n\nThere were just four priestly ordinations in the country, while three diocesan priests left the ministry. More than half of Belgium’s remaining diocesan priests are over 75 years of age.\n\nUnderstandably, the report does not give Mass attendance figures, as churches were closed for much of the pandemic year. But the previous year’s report recorded that a total of 241,029 people attended Mass on the third Sunday of October in 2019.\n\nSo around 3.6% of Belgium’s baptized Catholics attended Mass on an average Sunday. Compare that to 1967 — at the height of Suenens’ influence — when 42.9% of the country’s Catholics were present at Sunday Mass.\n\nIn short, the statistics suggest that, despite its good works, the Church in Belgium is suffering severe attrition.\n\nArchbishop André-Joseph Léonard in February 2012. Marek Blahuš via Wikimedia (CC BY-SA 3.0).\n\nThe battle for Brussels\n\nCardinal Suenens was the first churchman to lead the Archdiocese of Mechelen-Brussels (which was known as the Archdiocese of Mechelen until 1961). He was succeeded in 1979 by another influential prelate, Cardinal Godfried Danneels.\n\nA leader of the European Church’s liberal wing, Danneels took part in meetings of the St. Gallen Group, an informal circle of prelates who believed that the reforming spirit of the Second Vatican Council had been stifled.\n\nDanneels’ reputation was tarnished in 2010 by a leaked audio recording, in which he urged a young man not to publicly accuse his uncle, Bishop Roger Vangheluwe of Bruges, of sexually abusing him.\n\nThe disclosure was followed by an independent report which recorded 475 abuse complaints against clergy and church workers from the 1950s to the 1980s. The abuse crisis severely dented Belgian Catholicism’s reputation and strained relations between Belgian authorities and the Vatican.\n\nDanneels took part in the 2013 conclave that elected Pope Francis, appearing alongside the new pope on the loggia overlooking St. Peter’s Square. The pope named him a participant in the 2015 family synod in Rome.\n\nDanneels had retired as archbishop of Mechelen-Brussels in 2010. He was succeeded by the conservative Archbishop André-Joseph Léonard, marking a clear break in the see’s progressivist tradition.\n\nLéonard’s appointment was so controversial that Archbishop Karl-Josef Rauber, the former apostolic nuncio to Belgium, took the rare step of denouncing it. The Vatican diplomat said publicly that he would have preferred Danneels’ successor be an auxiliary bishop of Mechelen-Brussels.\n\nPope Francis accepted Léonard’s resignation, after a turbulent tenure, shortly after his 75th birthday in 2015. The pope chose Bishop Jozef De Kesel — a former auxiliary bishop under Danneels — as Léonard’s successor and soon made him a cardinal. In 2015, he also gave Rauber the red hat.\n\nThis year, Pope Francis named another Belgian to the College of Cardinals: Bishop Lucas Van Looy. But the 80-year-old emeritus bishop of Ghent asked to be withdrawn from consideration following criticism that he had failed to provide sufficient support for abuse victims.\n\nCardinal Jozef De Kesel. Philcotof via Wikimedia (CC BY-SA 4.0).\n\nContinuity or change?\n\nPope Francis’ intervention in 2015 helped to restore progressivist continuity in the Archdiocese of Mechelen-Brussels, Belgium’s primatial see. It is not surprising that its current incumbent, Cardinal De Kesel, was the driving force behind the Flemish bishops’ document allowing for blessings of same-sex couples.\n\nThe pope has not yet responded to the text, which appears to challenge last year’s declaration by the Vatican’s doctrinal department that the Church has no power to bless same-sex unions. He may never comment publicly on the document. But he will soon face a choice that will indicate his thoughts.\n\nDe Kesel, the Primate of Belgium and president of the Belgian bishops’ conference, submitted his resignation as archbishop of Mechelen-Brussels on his 75th birthday in June.\n\nThe weekly newspaper Katholiek Nieuwsblad reported that it was “an open secret” that De Kesel was not “pushing for further extension of his episcopate in Mechelen-Brussels.”\n\n“He was diagnosed with colon cancer in spring 2020 and the treatment and an operation in summer 2020 have taken their toll. The cardinal has recovered but remains weakened,” it said.\n\nThe paper speculated that De Kesel would remain in post “at least until the ad limina visit of the Belgian bishops,” scheduled for Nov. 21-26.\n\nIt seems that the pope must decide imminently whether to select De Kesel’s successor from among the Flemish bishops who collectively endorsed the new document or to go outside their circle.\n\nHis choice will send an important signal about the future of Belgian Catholicism.",

    "Wout van Aert relishes ‘perfect’ day for Belgium as Remco Evenepoel dominates road world championships": "Wout van Aert and Remco Evenepoel rewrote the ending of last year’s script of the 2021 derailed rainbow jersey bid to score big Sunday at the Wollongong road world championships.\n\nLike the disaster day that saw the Belgian team implode in front of thousands of fans in Leuven, Evenepoel escaped into an unlikely early move Sunday.\n\nBut unlike in 2021, the pocket rocket long-range specialist rode everyone off his wheel and dived straight into the rainbow jersey in a move that was straight out of the team bus briefing.\n\nAlso read: Evenepoel goes solo for sensational UCI Road World Championship victory\n\nCo-captain Van Aert missed the medals with a fourth-place finish but was more than consoled by a redemptive day for his blue-clad crew.\n\n“Of course, I am very happy with this title,” Van Aert said. “It was a fantastic race. You can determine tactics in advance, but if it also works out that way, awesome. When Remco moved with that group, I knew it was dangerous, but it was also a good situation for the team.”\n\n‘It will be a big party tonight’\n\nAll eyes were on Van Aert and Evenepoel this weekend. Last year, the two dissolved into dispute and accusation when Evenepoel rode clear in the chaotic streets of Flanders and didn’t look back when the team tactic was to ride for Van Aert as the sole leader.\n\nThe Belgian beef simmered some time before the two towed the party line, and insisted they would race Sunday with two clear leaders.\n\nBut with Evenepoel hot off Vuelta a España victory and Van Aert the terminator of the Tour de France, would the two Belgian ballers ride for national pride or personal ambition?\n\n“I think how we raced today really like a team. Like I said before, we wanted to become a world champion as a team, it didn’t matter how,” Evenepoel said.\n\n“It was Wout’s chance or my chance, it was my chance to go from early and Wout was to follow along and sprint. I guess the early attack made it today. But I just think we deserve it. We really deserve it.”\n\nAlso read: Can Evenepoel, Van Aert right the wrongs of 2021 at UCI Road World Championships?\n\nAs one of the leading nations in pro cycling, it seemed off-key that Belgium hadn’t worn elite rainbow bands for 10 years.\n\nPhilippe Gilbert was last into rainbows when he won the Valkenburg race in 2012, and home fans expected big things from a Van Aert-Evenepoel twin assault.\n\nVan Aert buried any personal pride at missing his own chance Sunday, and was among the first to congratulate Evenepoel at the finish.\n\n“It was our tactic that Remco would join attacks early with Quinten [Hermans] and when they did, it was a perfect situation also for me,” Van Aert said.\n\n“It took really long before countries realized it was dangerous when normally you should expect the chase would be full-on. But instead, it was a comfortable situation. It was our tactic, and when you see how Remco finished it with a long solo, he was just the strongest.”\n\nEvenepoel profited from the confusion and chaos of championship racing Sunday. Top favorites like Julian Alaphilippe, Michael Matthews and Tadej Pogačar missed the decisive split that let Evenepoel off the leash and only caught back in time to sprint for consolation places.\n\nVan Aert didn’t fully realize the situation on the road, and missed out on scoring a Belgian one-three when he was beaten to the line by Matthews and Christophe Laporte.\n\nBut for him, the race was already won.\n\n“We knew going into the last lap Evenepoel was alone, but without radio it’s really hard to have proper information and it’s already a strange race with nations, and without radio it makes it even more complicated,” Van Aert said.\n\n“That’s why I didn’t sprint for podium places. That’s a bit disappointing but I cannot complain. We won the race and I’m super happy with that.”\n\nThe sound of beers in the Belgian team bus will ripple across the world to the beerhalls of their bike-mad homeland Sunday.\n\n“It will be a big party tonight,” Evenepoel said. “I’m not going to see my bed I guess.”",

This is a visible way for them to campaign for future-oriented mobility and to demand a public space “on a human scale.”\n\nWhile some take part simply to seize an opportunity to ride a bike with friends and show that cyclists also matter in urban traffic, others come with more ambitious demands, such as asking for greater consideration by political leaders of the air quality in the Brussels region, and therefore climate issues.",
    "Belgium coach Roberto Martinez sees 'happiness, energy' in Eden Hazard": "Belgium coach Roberto Martinez believes playmaker Eden Hazard is in a good frame of mind and is not concerned about his lack of minutes at Real Madrid this season ahead of Nations League matches against Wales and Netherlands.\n\nHazard will potentially have a big role to play for Belgium at the World Cup in Qatar, but might have to prove his form and fitness with the national team as he has made just a single start in Madrid and played under 100 minutes in total in LaLiga this campaign.\n\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, MLS, more (U.S.)\n\n- World Cup Stock Watch: How do Belgium look with Qatar looming?\n\n\"He is good,\" Martinez told reporters on Wednesday. \"You always get the same question, 'has he played enough minutes?'.

    "Everton midfielder Amadou Onana was 'Razor Sharp' for Belgium": "By Sean Fisher 26th Sep, 2022 | 11:48am\n\nBelgian newspapers react to Amadou Onana's performance v Netherlands as Everton star shines\n\nBelgium suffered a 1-0 defeat to the Netherlands on Sunday evening, but Everton midfielder Amadou Onana was a standout performer for the Red Devils.\n\nOnana completed 75 minutes for Belgium in Amsterdam on Sunday, with the Toffees midfielder being substituted just minutes after Virgil van Dijk scored the only goal of the game.\n\nThe 21-year-old lined up alongside Alex Witsel and Kevin De Bruyne for the Red Devils and came away with raving reviews from the Belgian media.\n\nDaily newspaper Het Belang van Limburg gave Onana a 7/10 rating for his efforts, and said he added “power and depth” to Roberto Martinez’ side, as well as “razor sharp tackles”.\n\nGazet van Antwerpen also handed Onana a 7 for his performance, and said he “always thought ahead”, helping his side to challenge a very talented Dutch midfield.\n\nHet Laatste Nieuws continued the praise, and described Onana as “big, powerful and athletic”, while they also pointed out he was the “most dangerous” player for Belgium.\n\nRed-hot form\n\nRegardless of if he’s in the blue of Everton or the red of Belgium, it seems Onana can do no wrong at the moment.\n\nAt just 21, he has so much potential to keep improving. He already looked like an established starter in the Premier League and is standing out in an extremely talented Belgium squad.\n\nSome Toffees fans may have raised their eyebrows at the £33million fee paid by the club for Onana in the summer, but he’s already proved worthy of the price tag, and I imagine many Evertonians wish they’d tied him down for longer.\n\nHis all-around performance against the Netherlands was impressive. Not only did he go toe-to-toe with a high-octane Netherlands midfield, but Onana was solid defensively and looked threatening when bursting into the box.\n\nHis physicality and height only add to his talent. He’s extremely technically gifted, but it’s down to Frank Lampard to make sure he uses his height and body to improve even further.\n\nIt’s certainly an exciting time to be a Toffee, and confidence seems to be flowing in every player at the club.",
    "Why has Belgium got so cold recently?": "Credit: Belga.\n\nThe sudden dip in temperatures felt in Belgium and France is due to chilly winds descending from the British Isles onto our shores, French meteorologists explain.\n\nEven if 21 September marks the first day of Autumn, most Belgians heading into work last week will still have been surprised by just how cold it is all of a sudden.\n\nIn the capital, those already having to contend with public transport being disrupted due to Wednesday's strike also had to choose between a scarf and a beanie when heading out, as temperatures had dropped to 7°C.

The Inner Sanctum has looked at three takeaways from Belgium’s first game of the World Cup.\n\nThe Julie combination\n\nJulie Allemand led the team from the point guard position. (Photo: This Is Basketball)\n\nEven in a loss there are always positive takeaways to come from the game.\n\nIn this instance it was the back-court combination of Julie Allemand and Julie Vanloo. Allemand was able to charge through the United States defence, then providing her teammates with shots from behind the line. Vanloo was consistently able to execute her shots when she took them.\n\nIn defence, they could be seen putting pressure on the opposing guards. However their combination wasn’t enough to lead them to victory.\n\nAllemand ended the game with 10 points, four assists and two steals. Her stats don’t give an accurate representation on how well she played. If her teammates were able to nail their shots, she would have at least six more assists to her name.\n\nVanloo was decisive in both offence and defence. At the close of the game she had 13 points and four assists. However, she let down the team, gifting the United States with six turnovers. In attack she had a 44 per cent field goal percentage with only one shot being a two pointer.\n\nEmma Meesseman?\n\nEmma Meesseman was unable to get going during the whole four quarters.

Playing against her Chicago Sky and All-Star teammates, it seemed like she wasn’t going to have the best day on the court.\n\nMeesseman only had four points during the game, well below her average. With the pressure on her to perform she shot 33 per cent from the field, an unusual feat for the Belgian superstar.\n\nPlaying Korea tomorrow, she will be hoping to use her size advantage against the shorter defenders.\n\n“It’s very different for Emma here because she just spent three months in the US and she knows the players so it’s hard to get to play against them,” coach Valéry Demory said\n\nMore Basketball News\n\nTurnover, turnover, turnover\n\nThe Belgian Cats struggled in attack from their first possession with the ball. The next two were no better, as they were unable to get a shot off.\n\nThis was a common feature throughout all four quarters as the national team ended the game with 25 turnovers, with 14 of them coming in the opening half.\n\nWhether it was the players inexperience or them enduring pressure, they are looking to play better tomorrow against Korea. The Belgian coach believes they need to be ready for the defensive pressure that the United States put on them.\n\n“I would say the problem is the defensive intensity of Team USA. [They had] a lot of pressure that caused a lot of lost balls, but also a few stupid turnovers,” Demory said after the game.\n\n“The girls [mostly] play in the Belgian League, which is not used to this defensive pressure, and six girls need experience.

    "Teleworkers more than double in four years in Belgium": "Teleworking is growing in Belgium and impacts mobility habits, FPS Mobility and Transport explained in a press release published on Monday based on a survey of 1,250 Belgian workers between June and July this year.\n\nIn four years, the share of teleworkers has more than doubled. In 2018, 17% of Belgians were teleworking at least one day a week compared to 32% today, a trend that has primarily been driven by COVID-19 measures, the press release stated.\n\nBrussels residents telework the most regularly, with 43% of respondents teleworking at least once a week, compared to 28% in Wallonia and 33% in Flanders.\n\nOn the mobility side, the survey notes that, in 2022, 35 million kilometres travelled each day were avoided thanks to teleworking, of which 14 million kilometres would have been done by car. Results also highlighted that the proportion of teleworkers increased based on the distance between their homes and workplace.\n\nOver 50% of responders who live farther than 50 km from their workplace telework at least once a week.\n\nTeleworking has also changed the modes of transport workers use, shifting to more sustainable modes of transport like cycling and riding trains which are more prevalent (61%) among teleworkers than non-teleworkers (40%).\n\nAnother positive aspect of mobility is that teleworking allows for the distribution of trips throughout the day or the week. Trips for shopping and services increase on teleworking days (28%) or are made during the week and the day rather than in the evening, during weekends or holidays (32%).\n\nTeleworking has allowed for a reduction in the number of vehicles on the road, which has a direct impact on road safety. According to estimates by the Vias Institute, in 2021, with teleworking, the number of traffic fatalities was reduced by 35, the number of severe injuries by 242, and more than 3,000 accidents leading to death or injuries have also been avoided.\n\nThe FPS aims to continue to promote teleworking to achieve the objectives of a 50% reduction in road deaths by 2030 and zero deaths by 2050 set in the “All for Zero” road safety plan.\n\n(Anne-Sophie Gayet | EURACTIV.com)",

    "Iran-Belgium prisoner swap: Belgian court to decide on controversial exchange treaty": "\"It's been more than 203 days since I last saw my best friend,\" said Olivier Van Steirtegem as he runs his fingers swiftly across his piano in his home in Brussels, playing a mesmerizing jazz tune. It's a tribute to his friend, Olivier Vandecasteele, who was arrested on February 24 by Iranian authorities on charges of spying.\n\n\"This song I'm playing is 'John Boy' by Brad Mehldau. It was the last one Olivier and I listened to together, before he was arrested by Iran,\" Van Steirtegem, 42, who is the owner of an office furniture store, told DW. \"He is now in complete isolation in a cell and in a poor psychological state. He isn't eating well, has an infection and has lost a lot of weight.\"\n\nVandecasteele, a 41-year-old humanitarian aid worker, had been living and working in Iran since 2015. He had been exploring options to move out of the country and eventually start a new project.\n\n\"But the Iranian authorities had different plans for him,\" said Van Steirtegem.\n\nOlivier Van Steirtegem, right, has started a petition asking the Belgian government to take action to free his friend\n\nFlipping through an album of pictures together, he remembered the fateful day in February when he got the phone call about Vandecasteele's arrest.\n\n\"The neighbors said he was in his apartment in Tehran and was waiting for a pizza delivery. But when his doorbell rang, instead of the pizza delivery person, Iranian authorities forced themselves into his flat and arrested him,\" Van Steirtegem said.\n\n'We are sending a message that we are weak'\n\nIn order to get him released, on July 21, the Belgian government ratified a prisoner exchange treaty with Iran. According to the treaty, Iranians imprisoned in Belgium, would be allowed to serve their sentence in Iran and vice versa.\n\nBut the treaty has been slammed by some members of the Belgian parliament, including some Iranian dissidents, critics of the regime in Teheran, as well as human rights groups who fear that this would lead to the release of Assadollah Assadi — an Iranian diplomat who has been serving a 20-year prison sentence in Belgium for trying to plot a bomb attack on a rally organized by rivals of the Iranian regime, in France in 2018.\n\nThey also say that the accord will give Iran a free pass to continue engaging in terrorism and taking people hostage in Iran and around the world.\n\nBelgian court to decide on prisoner swap deal with Iran\n\n\"If Belgium appeases the regime in Iran in this manner, we are sending across a message that we are weak and are ready to give them what they want,\" Darya Safai an Iranian-Belgian Member of the Belgian Parliament, from the Flemish nationalists party, told DW.\n\n\"I have been imprisoned in Iran myself for fighting for women's rights. I completely understand what Olivier's family is going through. But this is not the only isolated case. There are other European hostages in Iran and we need a better solution to ensure they're all released,\" she said.\n\n'Not fair to keep an innocent man in jail'\n\nVandecasteele was arrested and imprisoned in Iran on espionage charges which the Belgian government says are baseless\n\nBesides Vandecasteele, Swedish-Iranian academic Ahmadreza Dijalali and French tourist Benjamin Briere are some of the other Western nationals being held hostage in Iran.\n\nOut of 131 Belgian parliamentatians, 79 voted in favor of the prisoner-exchange treaty, while 41 rejected it and 11 abstained from voting.\n\nBelgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo acknowledged that it was a tough decision, but said it was not \"blackmail\" and Belgium had to consider the pleas of Vandecasteele's family.\n\n\"What do you say to his family, that we will let him rot in his cell?\" he said in response to criticisms of the treaty.\n\nAccording to AFP, a lawyer representing the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), an Iranian opposition group in exile, said the Brussels appeal court had agreed to cross-examine the case before allowing the swap.\n\nThe court is legally challenging the Belgian government's decision at a hearing that began on September 19.\n\n'Negotiate with force'\n\nPrisoner swaps often takes place between autocracies and democracies where the latter is keen to bring their citizens back home, and the former is keen to use this tactic to achieve their political goals.\n\nExchanges can take place by either exchanging people held captive, or by exchanging money as in the case of British Iranian aid worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, where the UK transferred money to Iran in order to guarantee her release.\n\nBut Belgian parliamentarian Safai believes that prisoner swaps don't work with Iran, and the only true way to negotiate with the country is with force.\n\n\"That is the only language that the Ayatollahs understand. So solutions in the form of sanctions could work better. It is important for the West to take a united stance in confronting Iran. That's the only way that you can ensure security in Europe and stop the process of Iran taking people hostage,\" she told DW.\n\nA man protests outside the Antwerp Criminal Court, during the trial of Iranian diplomat Assadollah Assadi, who was sentenced to prison in Belgium last year for his role in a bomb plot.\n\nAt a press conference in Brussels last week organized by the NCRI, John Bercow, a former British politician who was speaker of the House of Commons, shared a similar view and highlighted that such a prison swap would not prove fruitful in the long run.\n\n\"If you give the beast what the beast wants, then the beast will repeatedly follow the same tactics. We have to look at the wider picture and not just focus on isolated cases,\" he said.\n\nVan Steirtegem understands the complexity of this case since it involves swapping an innocent person in exchange for a terrorist. But he believes it is the only way to get his friend released.\n\n\"I might be biased but I think right now, Olivier needs all the support from the Belgian government. This will also give Belgians the impression that their government cares for innocent people like Olivier,\" he said.\n\nVan Steirtegem has also started a petition asking the Belgian government to enable the prompt release of his friend. More than 25,000 people have signed it so far.\n\nCould the Iranian nuclear deal provide an opportunity?\n\nWhile a final decision is still pending from the court, Roxane Farmanfarmaian, a British lecturer in international politics at the University of Cambridge specializing in Iran, told DW that the Iran nuclear talks could also provide an opportunity for the West to negotiate with the Islamic republic.\n\n\"The Americans have advised Belgium not to proceed with this prison swap since they wish to add on to the nuclear negotiations a larger swap of prisoners, which would involve prisoners from a number of European countries as well as Americans,” she told DW.\n\nThree members of US Congress — Randy K.Weber, Louie Gohmert and Brian Fitzpatrick — have sent a letter to the Belgian prime minister asking him to oppose the treaty.\n\n\"I think Belgium feels as though the time is right and there is no guarantee that the negotiations with the nuclear deal will go through. So they don't want to wait and make their citizens in Tehran wait until something on a larger international scale takes place,\" Farmanfarmaian added.\n\nIrrespective of how the law and politics shape the future of the treaty, Van Steirtegem has not lost hope.\n\n\"I know it is going to be a long fight, but I hope to get a call from the government telling me, okay, listen, everything has been cleared and Olivier will be back before Christmas,\" he said.\n\n\"That's what his family and I are looking forward to right now,\" he added.\n\nEdited by: Sonia Phalnikar",
    "Projects in Walloon, Belgium point to a future of biomass as an energy source": "The cost of energy is historically high in Belgium and, to add to the problem, fossil fuels are becoming scarcer as we consume them. To adapt, farmers in Wallonia are developing more sustainable and local alternatives, reported Brussels Times One alternative to fossil fuels is biomethanation which consists of the degradation of biomass, such as manure from a livestock farm or organic waste from an agri-food plant. The biomass is heated in a tank to become biogas, which is composed of 60% methane and 40% carbon dioxide. This biogas is then purified in order to isolate methane as energy.Simply put, organic matter is recycled to transform it into a source of energy, such as heating systems and compressed natural gas (or CNG, fuel for motor vehicles.)Farmers are able to use the organic matter produced by their livestock to transform it into biomethane (renewable natural gas) to heat farm buildings or sell CNG.The first Walloon biomethanation site was inaugurated in 2020 in Fleurus, Hainaut, and already produces 100,000 tons of output each year.This idea of \"energy community\" also appeals to those on the side of public authorities, such as the municipality of Dour in the province of Hainaut, which hopes to use the biomass from their citizens to produce gas by 2024.The equivalent of one ton of organic waste from households in the municipality would be converted into a product that will either be gas for the network or made into CNG for vehicles.Wallonia has a high potential of 8.7 Tw/h in terms of biomethane and other studies even suggest the figure could go up to 15 Tw/h. This would represent 10% of the annual gas consumption in Belgium.Many believe this alternative energy source has a future in Belgium, even if the costs of installing the equipment necessary for the process are high and will require investors, private or public.",

    "Belgium in Brief: Should strikes be a fundamental right?": "Credit: Belga\n\nSo often portrayed as a nuisance, strikes are disruptive by nature but also a vital tool to protect worker conditions. Whilst politicians and loyal media are quick to write them off as collective action going too far, they are almost always a final resort only used when diplomatic efforts have been exhausted.\n\nStrikes can also serve as a reminder of how vital some sectors are to keeping civil life running smoothly. We rarely pay any attention to public services until they stop working. For all the reasons given not to tax company profits (think of claims that it stifles innovation), strikes shine a light on who really keeps the machines running.\n\nWhen was the last time you saw business executives go on strike? The Irish bank strikes of the '60s and '70s provide an isolated example of the financial sector taking this form of action. Yet the strikes had little effect on the nation's economic activity and daily life continued.\n\nNonetheless, industrial action can be a vital lever to bring meaningful change to the lives of those we depend on most. And yet a new EU directive could undermine or remove this fundamental right by outlawing strikes when they might hinder the functioning of the single market in certain emergency situations.\n\nThough lawmakers deny that this is the intention, the proposed Single Market Emergency Instrument has conspicuously left out the text that enshrines the right to strike in law. Trade Unions have been quick to point out the omission and have urged the European Commission to amend the text to ensure that fundamental rights are not sacrificed to commercial interests.\n\nWith trade unions in Belgium holding the third national strike this year over the lack of government measures to tackle the cost of living crisis, public opinion about strikes might be split.\n\nShould industrial action be a fundamental right or should we impose conditions?

    "World reacts, Belgium goes ballistic over Evenepoel at La Vuelta": "Crowds gathered roadside in Spain and in Belgium to watch the final challenge for 22-year-old Evenepoel at La Vuelta.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final tough day of climbing was an enthralling stage, but the young Belgian wasn’t put into difficulty by nearest rival Enric Mas (Movistar) and maintained his starting lead of over two minutes to the finish in Puerto de Navacerrada.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was a historic moment for Belgium, and presuming no disaster for Evenepoel tomorrow, it will break a 44-year drought for the great cycling nation in the Grand Tours.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohan De Muynck was the last Belgian to win a Grand Tour, after taking out the Giro d’Italia in 1978, and at the time it was unthinkable that there would be an extended absence from the top step of the podium at the Grand Tours.\n\n\n\nNonetheless, it has been a very long gap between wins for cycling-mad Belgium to add to their 32 Grand Tour wins, a streak that Evenepoel will put to bed in Madrid. Belgium is celebrating the news with near blanket coverage, particularly via the Flemish media, with het Nieuwsblad assembling three of the most recent Grand Tour winners to celebrate his achievement.\n\n\n\n(L to R) Freddy Maertens, Johan De Muynck and Lucien Van Impe show off their Grand Tour jerseys. For Evenepoel himself, there isn’t going to be much downtime as he heads off to Australia the day after the Vuelta finish to participate in the World Championships. After that, there will be time to reflect on where his future lies, with balancing Classics and Grand Tours at the front of mind.\n\n\n\n\n\n“From now on, I think I have to make a big decision in what my career direction will be because this year I’ve won Classics and also a Grand Tour,” Evenepoel said.\n\n\n\n\n\n“I can combine them, but probably I really have to make a season in two parts; focusing on one-day races and then on Grand Tours.\n\n\n\n\n\n“For example, it’s not possible to focus on Liège and the Giro. But maybe to focus on the Giro and end-of-season Classics and Worlds.\n\n\n\n\n\n“It’s going to be a big task, anyway. The first thing in any case is to enjoy this victory.”\n\n\n\n\n\nEvenepoel’s parents, Patrick and Agna, were on hand to celebrate their son’s achievement, with SBS Sport 's Christophe Mallet catching up with them after the finish.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Every dad is proud of his kid,” said Patrick Evenepoel. “Remco is a guy who, when he is focused on something, goes not 100 per cent, but 200 per cent. All this season his one goal was the Vuelta, and Liege, and the two goals he has (achieved).”\n\n\n\nThree-time Vuelta a Espana winner Alberto Contador had his heart set on a Mas victory, with the second-placed finisher one of the graduates of Contador’s foundation to support young Spanish cyclists. But he recognised the class of Evenepoel and talked about the significance of where the victory came in the young rider’s career.\n\n\n\n\n\n“I think that it’s so important for him,” Contador said. “The question we all had before the Vuelta was whether he can win a big Tour. He tried at the Giro d’Italia, though it’s true that he came back from a really bad crash. I’m sure he’s thinking now about the Tour de France.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Now Vingegaard and Pogacar are doing really good and are really strong, but Evenepoel is young and really strong, he’s got time to take more experience in the races and training.”\n\n\n\nThere were admirers from afar as well, with two-time Tour de France winner Pogacar excited about the prospect of racing Evenepoel in the coming seasons, anticipating an exciting competition between the top contenders for Grand Tour victories.\n\n\n\n\n\n“I think next year is going to be really interesting… I think even bigger competition is coming for the next couple of years,” Pogacar said. “I also hope Egan Bernal will come back after his crash. We're going to have a fantastic couple of years battling each other.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Remco looks super good. In my opinion, he's in a good position to bring it home. He looks strong, he looks calm. He's really, really strong.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Everybody knows that he's super strong and super talented. He can do everything: time trial, climb and ride on the flat. I was expecting him to be good and he’s delivered on the expectations.”\n\n\n\nPatrick Lefevere, the at-times controversial boss of Quick-Step Alpha Vinyl, lauded Evenepoel’s win.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Even me he has surprised with the speed at which he is growing. But that is a sign of the great champions,” Lefevere immediately praised his pupil.\n\n\n\n\n\n“After Liège-Bastogne-Liège, he clicked. I am very pleased because there are many people, especially in Flanders, who are always complaining and being negative about him. That he can't do this and that.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Hopefully this is the start of something formidable. Doing this with a Belgian rider is really a great honour. Many people have not experienced that last Belgian overall victory of 44 years ago. I was already there then because I rode with Van Impe, Merckx, Maertens and De Muynck. And we've only just begun.”\n\n\n\nThe celebrations will likely continue for a long time in Madrid and Belgium after Evenepoel takes that step to the top of the podium. This is a moment for adulation and acknowledgement of a tremendous performance, but for many, it is an appetiser for a bright, competitive future at the top of the sport.\n\n\n\n",

    "Belgian PM tells EU to ‘stop the bleeding’ of energy prices as country unveils new measures": "Belgium's PM Alexander De Croo called on the EU to \"stop the bleeding\" of high energy prices | Laurie Dieffembacq/Belga Mag/AFP via Getty Images\n\nBelgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo called on the EU to \" stop the bleeding\" of high energy prices Wednesday as he unveiled new national measures to curb costs for consumers and conserve resources.\n\n\"In Europe, we should only have one priority,\" De Croo told a press conference. \"It is only at the European level that we will succeed to bring prices down.\"\n\nHe added: \"Only the European Union can stop the bleeding.\"\n\nBelgium is the latest EU country to introduce reforms to curb prices at the national level, and EU energy ministers are set to meet on September 9 to discuss European-level solutions. Since Russia launched the war in Ukraine, the Belgian prime minister has been a strong advocate of introducing a price cap on gas at the EU level, warning last week warned that the \"next five to 10 winters will be difficult.\"\n\nDe Croo's government plans to impose windfall taxes on energy producers. While the tax would initially target the nuclear sector, a working group will look into other energy producers, but De Croo did not specify which ones. Spain, Italy, Romania and Greece have already implemented similar measures, and the idea is also gaining traction in Germany.\n\nBelgium will also cut energy use in public buildings by, for example, requiring air conditioning use to be reduced and heating only be turned up to 19 degrees Celsius maximum. Lighting in public buildings will be switched off between 7 p.m. and 6 a.m.\n\nThe government is also holding discussions with the financial sector about potentially pausing mortgage payments for households most affected by soaring prices, and will work with employers' federations to find solutions for businesses and small and mid-size enterprises (SMEs).\n\nBelgium plans to extend other energy measures currently in force until the end of March 2023, such as a social tariff for low- income families; a 6 percent VAT on electricity, gas and heat; as well as reducing the excise tax on petrol and diesel.\n\n\"I will remain in contact with the European Commission so that these measures can be taken,\" De Croo said. \"Europe must show that it is capable of protecting its citizens, of protecting its companies.\"",
    "Museums on prescription: Brussels tests cultural visits to treat anxiety": "A tour of ancient sewers? An encounter with a masterpiece of 16th-century lace-making? These are two of the therapies on offer to people in Brussels suffering from depression, stress or anxiety.\n\nFrom this month, psychiatrists in one of the city’s largest hospitals have been able to offer patients “museum prescriptions”, a free visit with a few friends or family members to discover one or more of Brussels’ cultural institutions.\n\nDelphine Houba, a Brussels deputy mayor in charge of culture, believes the project is the first of its kind in Europe. The first objective is to reinforce access to culture after the pressured days of lockdown, she told the Observer. “I want everybody back in our cultural institutions… but we know that, even before Covid, for some people it [was] not easy to open the door of a museum, they don’t feel at ease, they don’t think that it’s for them. And I really want to show that cultural venues are for everybody.”\n\nThe second goal, she said, is to give doctors “a new tool in the healing process”. The young socialist politician was inspired by a similar project in Canada, where doctors have been issuing prescriptions to the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts since 2018.\n\nIn Brussels, the pilot project is running for six months, involving five museums that are directly under the control of city authorities. These include the city’s history museum, a centre for contemporary art, and the fashion and lace museum.\n\nPatients may also discover the sewer museum, which allows them to stroll 10 metres underground along the banks of the Senne, the hidden river of Brussels, largely paved over in the 19th century. Or they could explore the collection of outfits belonging to the Manneken Pis, the statue of a peeing boy that has become a symbol of Belgium’s self-deprecating humour\n\nThe cherubic bronze figure has nearly 1,100 costumes, including one from King Louis XV of France from 1747 to make amends for his soldiers’ theft of the statue, and a gift from the Rolling Stones, adorned with the band’s tongue logo, that made its first appearance in July.\n\n“Anything could have therapeutic value if it helps people get a good feeling and get in touch with themselves,” said Dr Johan Newell, a psychiatrist at Brugmann University Hospital, which is taking part in the pilot scheme.\n\nThe Museum of the City of Brussels. Photograph: Arterra Picture Library/Alamy\n\nHe expects museum prescriptions would suit people suffering from depression, anxiety, autism spectrum disorders, psychosis and bipolar disorder. “I think almost anyone could benefit from it,” he said. “It would probably be more adapted for people who are already a little bit further on in the recovery process”, rather than those who are severely ill, he said.\n\nMuseum prescriptions, Newell stressed, were a voluntary addition to medication, psychotherapy, individual or group therapy, as well as exercise, healthy eating and other forms of relaxation.\n\n“It’s just one extra tool that could help people get out of the house: to resocialise, reconnect with society.”\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

People recovering from brain injuries, as well as older people and children, could also benefit, suggested Newell.\n\nHouba, who chaired the board of Brugmann hospital before her election in 2019, said the one-page prescription was designed to be as simple as possible. People “won’t have a guide or something special because we don’t want them to be stigmatised or to feel different.”\n\nPatients would discuss their visit before and after with their doctor, who would check “how the experience was for them, what they liked, what they didn’t like,” Newell said. As well as a chance to reconnect with society, he also sees an opportunity for quiet reflection away from the bustle of life. “Our society is so, so busy, so full of stress and stimuli,” he said. A museum prescription gives people an “opportunity to settle down for a moment”.",
