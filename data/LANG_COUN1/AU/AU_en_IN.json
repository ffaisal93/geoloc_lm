    "Apple will manufacture iPhone 14 in India": "NEW DELHI — Apple will make its iPhone 14 in India, the company said on Monday, as manufacturers shift production from China amid geopolitical tensions and pandemic restrictions that have disrupted supply chains for many industries.\n\n“The new iPhone 14 lineup introduces groundbreaking new technologies and important safety capabilities. We’re excited to be manufacturing iPhone 14 in India,” Apple said in a statement.\n\nApple unveiled its latest line-up of iPhones earlier this month. They will have improved cameras, faster processors and longer lasting batteries at the same prices as last year’s models.\n\nIndia is the world’s second-largest smartphone market after China but Apple iPhone sales have struggled to capture a large share of the market against cheaper smartphones from competitors.\n\nThe announcement from the Cupertino, California-based company dovetails with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s push for local manufacturing, which has been a key goal for his government ever since he took office in 2014.\n\nThe tech company has bet big on India, where it first began manufacturing its iPhone SE in 2017 and has since continued to assemble a number of iPhone models there. Apple opened its online store for India two years ago, but the pandemic has delayed plans for a flagship store in India, according to local media reports.\n\nThe latest model will be shipped out by Foxconn, a major iPhone assembler, whose facilities are on the outskirts of Chennai, a city in southern India.\n\nApple is likely to shift about 5% of its iPhone 14 production to India from later this year, raising it to 25% by 2025, according to a JP Morgan report quoted by the Press Trust of India news agency.\n\nThe analysts expect that nearly a quarter of all Apple products to be manufactured outside China by 2025, compared to about 5% now. Supply chain risks like the stringent COVID-19 lockdowns seen in China are likely the trigger for such relocation efforts that will continue over the next two or three years, the report said.\n\n“Apple has been trying to diversify its supply chain for a while, but these efforts have grown in the last two years over trade sanctions between the U.S. and China,” said Sanyam Chaurasia, an analyst at Canalys.\n\nLast year, the tech giant manufactured around 7 million iPhones in India. This news is likely to significantly increase India-made Apple smartphones, he added.\n\nHe said the plan to make more iPhones in India may also lead Apple to drop its prices for the Indian market, making it more competitive. “You can adopt a more aggressive pricing strategy if you manufacture locally,” Chaurasia said.\n\nMost of Apple Inc.’s smartphones and tablets are assembled by contractors with factories in China, but the company started asking them in 2020 to look at the possibility of moving some production to Southeast Asia or other places after repeated shutdowns to fight COVID-19 disrupted its global flow of products.\n\nApple hasn’t released details, but news reports say the company planned to set up assembly of tablet computers and wireless earphones in Vietnam.\n\nOther companies are keeping or expanding manufacturing in China to serve the domestic market while shifting export-oriented work to other countries due to rising wages and other costs, as well as the difficulty for foreign executives to visit China due to anti-COVID-19 travel restrictions.",
    "Record for India after series win against Australia": "India beat Australia in a thrilling run chase in Hyderabad in the decider on Sunday to complete a 2-1 series victory.\n\nIndia maintained their excellent recent record in run chases in T20Is with a win over Australia in Hyderabad in the third and final T20I. Chasing 187 to win following impressive half centuries to Tim David (54) and Cameron Green (52), India completed the run chase with one ball to spare to make it 13 successful run chases in the format in 14 attempts since 2021.\n\nThe series victory also marked India's 21st T20I win in the calendar year, the most ever recorded by a team in men's T20Is. Pakistan had held the record until now with 20 T20I wins in the year 2021.\n\nIndia drew level with the Thailand women's team, which recorded 21 victories and four losses in 2019.\n\nMost wins by a Men's international team in a calendar year:\n\nTeam Wins Year India 21* 2022 Pakistan 20 2021 Pakistan 17 2018 Uganda 16 2021 India 15 2016\n\nGreen got Australia off to a flyer to start the match, with the young all-rounder reaching his half-century in just 19 balls - a record against India - as the visitors looked set for a big total.\n\nAustralia lost the key wickets of Steve Smith (9) and Glenn Maxwell (6) in quick succession, with David's last hitting helping the visitors compile a decent score of 186/7.\n\nIndia's run chase turned out to be a difficult one after they were reduced to 30/2. A century partnership between Virat Kohli and Suryakumar Yadav put India back on track, but with the latter dismissed in the 14th over, the task turned out to be harder.\n\nWith 11 to win off the last over from Daniel Sams, Virat Kohli, who finished on 63 off 48 balls, hit a six off the first ball to make it five runs required off five balls. However, Kohli was dismissed the next ball with the equation further reduced to four runs needed from two balls.\n\nAn edge for four through third man off Hardik Pandya's bat gave India the record-equalling win and a series victory.",
    "First Covid, now monkeypox – India’s role is key in the scramble for jabs": "Rishabh Kumar woke up in his California bedroom in a cold sweat. In the space of three weeks, the 37-year-old finance executive had lost his mother, best friend, brother-in-law and two cousins. They all died of Covid back home in India in April and May last year. The experience left him shattered and experiencing nightmares that continue to this day.\n\nOn this particular night last month, it was not thoughts of Covid tormenting him, but monkeypox, which had just been declared a health emergency in the US. Like many Indians at home and abroad, Kumar was worried for his country and the rest of his family.\n\nAt the root of Kumar’s concerns were frustration and anger over India’s missteps during the Delta wave in 2021, when the country’s crematoriums and graveyards were full of bodies and smoke from funeral pyres. India has the largest vaccine manufacturing capability in the world, yet a failure to order and produce enough Covid doses in time led to shortages and a slow rollout. His mother had had a single vaccine shot before she tested positive – the others he grieves for had none.\n\nThe world needs India to step up when it comes to vaccine production Ishwar Gilada\n\nNow, as monkeypox cases climb steadily around the world, India’s government has been relatively prepared, say public health experts. Researchers at the National Institute of Virology in the western city of Pune isolated the monkeypox virus in July. And the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), the government’s network of biomedical labs, has offered the isolated virus to private firms for the development of indigenous vaccines.\n\nHealth workers screen passengers arriving from abroad for monkeypox at Anna International Airport terminal in Chennai, 3 June 2022. Photograph: Arun Sankar/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut experts want India to do more. So far, only 12 monkeypox cases have been reported in the country, with one death. That’s a tiny fraction of the 61,000 known cases worldwide. Yet Covid has taught us that that could change. India’s vaccine preparedness matters not just for its population, but for the other developing nations dependent on its shots.\n\n“It doesn’t matter that India has only a few cases at the moment – the world needs India to step up when it comes to vaccine production,” says Ishwar Gilada, an infectious diseases specialist who set up India’s first Aids and HIV clinic in 1985.\n\nGlobally, monkeypox has killed fewer than two dozen people this year, according to the World Health Organization, and research suggests that the mortality rate is significantly lower than from Covid. Monkeypox spreads primarily through prolonged, direct contact with a patient, rather than through respiratory droplets or aerosols.\n\nStill, this is the first time the virus has spread widely to countries with no history of monkeypox: 104 nations have reported cases. And the global scramble for vaccines that marked the Covid pandemic has started with monkeypox, presenting a challenge for public health initiatives seeking funding, such as the Global Fund, which met on 21 September for its seventh replenishment conference.\n\nAn isolation ward built as a precautionary measure for monkeypox patients at a hospital in Ahmedabad, 25 July 2022. Photograph: Sam Panthaky/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOnly one vaccine, for smallpox – Jynneos, produced by Danish firm Bavarian Nordic – has so far been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use against monkeypox.\n\nWealthy nations such as the US, UK and Australia, joined the queue for doses early but are already facing shortages. As with Covid, poorer countries risk falling far behind in accessing the vaccines. India is yet to order any.\n\n“Even if the government ordered vaccines today, the pile-up of demand is such that we aren’t going to get doses for many, many months,” says Gagandeep Kang, a virologist at the Christian Medical College, Vellore, and the first Indian woman elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of London.\n\nIndia’s efforts to develop indigenous vaccines for monkeypox could help it limit its dependence on Jynneos eventually, but that, too, will take time. “This isn’t going to yield vaccines soon either,” says Kang.\n\nIf the spread of monkeypox can be contained, mass vaccinations may not be needed, and some researchers suggest that a vaccine may not be needed at all – at least for now. T Jacob John, a paediatrician and virologist who was one of the founders of India’s successful polio vaccination programme, says: “If we could do well without a vaccine for HIV/Aids, we can manage here too.”\n\nHowever, in some ways monkeypox presents a challenge more complex than HIV, says Gilada. “There’s a double social stigma, especially in a conservative country like India.” It is a sexually transmitted disease – a vast majority of cases involve men who have sex with men. “I wouldn’t be surprised if the cases we’re seeing reported are just a tiny fraction of the actual number,” he says.\n\nWhile India waits for a homemade vaccine and for demand for Jynneos to ease up, its vast pharmaceutical industry should focus on developing antiviral treatments for monkeypox, Kang says.\n\nHealth workers test for the monkey pox virus at a molecular laboratory set up by the Tamil Nadu health department in Chennai. Photograph: Sri Loganathan/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nYet Covid brutally exposed a challenge that the government is still to address. “India does not fund research in sufficient amounts,” says John, meaning the private sector is left to take the risks. Even though the ICMR has invited private firms to join efforts to develop vaccines, it has not issued any research grants to incentivise their science.\n\nHowever, the way monkeypox is spread is a silver lining for India, says Gilada. Once a vaccine or antiviral is available, the country’s vast Aids-control network – consisting of 1,160 centres dedicated to treating sexually transmitted infections – could offer rapid frontline services. “We should be able to prioritise those who are most vulnerable, in settings where they already feel somewhat comfortable,” says Gilada.\n\nFor those traumatised by the unnecessary human losses of the Covid pandemic, the way India responds to monkeypox will be closely scrutinised.\n\nBack in San Jose, California, Kumar said it would be “unpardonable” if the Indian government were to repeat its Covid mistakes. “I hope they have learned their lessons,” he says. “I can’t deal with these nightmares any more.”\n\nSign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:\n\nSign up for Global Dispatch – please check your spam folder for the confirmation email\n\n\n\n",
    "'India has a big role to play': New Delhi is trying to turn the country into a chip powerhouse": "The government of India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has looked to boost the country's chipmaking prowess. Money Sharma | AFP | Getty Images\n\nIndia could have a large role to play in the semiconductor industry, analysts say, as the world's fifth-largest economy looks to boost its domestic chip sector. Along with other countries like the U.S., India has been looking to forge strategic alliances around semiconductors, a critical technology that goes into many of the devices we use from smartphones to refrigerators. But India has also been making moves to bring the manufacturing of chips to the country and has laid out incentives for the industry. \"I think India has a crucial role to play,\" Pranay Kotasthane, chairperson of the high tech geopolitics program at the Takshashila Institution, told CNBC's \"Beyond the Valley\" podcast, published last week.\n\nIndia tries to woo giants\n\nThe issue for many countries looking to boost their chipmaking prowess is that the companies and countries that dominate the industry are few and far between. For example, Taiwan and South Korea make up about 80% of the global foundry market. Foundries are facilities that manufacture chips that other companies design.\n\nIndia has typically not been in the mix of the top countries for semiconductors. So there aren't many giant Indian chip firms and certainly no leading-edge manufacturing companies. While India might not have native semiconductor firms, it's plan under the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi relies on trying to attract foreign giants. In December, India greenlit a $10 billion incentive plan for the semiconductor industry. Therefore, New Delhi's strategy seems to be twofold — lure in foreign companies and build on areas where India has an advantage.\n\nIndian strengths\n\nThe large amount of capital required, the time it takes to set up factories and uncertainty over the business, tax and trade environment has often put companies off setting up in India. \"Previous attempts in India failed because of apprehensions on these counts,\" Kotasthane said. However, there are signs that things are changing. \"The track record has been not great but the new government has been heading in the right direction ... [with] policies to drive impetus and attract leading semi and fab companies,\" Neil Shah, partner at tech consultancy Counterpoint Research, told CNBC.\n\nIndia's strength is the huge domestic consumption market when it comes to semiconductors, being the second-largest populous economy in the world. Neil Shah Partner, Counterpoint Research\n\nIndia has a number of strengths which could back up its bid to be a global chipmaking hub. \"India's strength is the huge domestic consumption market when it comes to semiconductors, being the second-largest populous economy in the world,\" Shah said. The analyst also said incentive plans will help. \"Also, India has loads of English speaking engineering talent and [a] cheaper labor force making it cost effective,\" Shah added. That well-educated and cheap labor force could help India in a specific area of the semiconductor supply chain — chip design — an area that requires a large number of skilled workers.\n\n\"I have no doubt that India has a big role to play,\" Kotasthane said. \"India has semiconductor humanpower. Semiconductor design requires large numbers of skilled engineers and this is where India's strength lies,\" he added. Kotasthane said that of the largest semiconductor firms in the world, eight have design houses in India. While also in the early stages, India is trying to boost its domestic companies to build technology. \"What we are now seeing from the Indian government side is trying to take the next step. We have design centers of international firms, but India doesn't have a lot of intellectual property, which can be termed Indian ... because these are companies from other countries which are doing this. So now, the next step is the effort to build an ecosystem where there is some Indian IP (intellectual property) by Indian companies,\" Kotasthane said.\n\nManufacturing in focus\n\nWhile design is one area the analysts say that India can find success, manufacturing is a little more difficult. In terms of the most cutting-edge chips, such as those in the latest flagship smartphones, Taiwan's TSMC dominates the manufacturing arena. India doesn't have any fabs, or semiconductor fabrication plants, which manufacture chips. However, the government has looked to woo foreign chipmakers. ISMC Digital, a consortium of investors, is planning to build a $3 billion manufacturing facility in India. Tower Semiconductor, an Israeli company, would be the technology partner on that project.\n\nwatch now",
    "India’s nine-day celebration heads to South Morang": "By Pam Kiriakidis\n\nThe nine-day Hindu festival Navratri is about to come alive in South Morang, celebrating with a night of Garba dancing and tradition on October 1.\n\nNavratri is a period of nine days to honour Hindu mother goddess Mahadevi, who symbolises the divine feminine.\n\nVarious regions of India celebrate the annual event differently through religious ceremonies and Garba dance, which is traditionally performed around a lit lamp or a picture or statue of the goddess.\n\nMernda and District Residents Association, MADRA, invited Sanskriti Junction to perform two dances – a women’s performance and a children’s performance – during the celebration.\n\nTraditionally the nine-day festival is danced to the beat of an Indian dhol drum, however, on the night a hired DJ will play traditional Indian music instead.\n\nMADRA secretary Shweta Bhatti said the combined event ‘Vivid Navratri’ was organised to help the local Indian community feel at home, as it was a special time in Indian culture.\n\n“When we are from another country, we miss our culture and sometimes we feel isolated, so this kind of community event gives them an environment where they don’t feel isolated and they don’t miss too much of their country,” she said.\n\n“There is no age barrier, so every person there generally knows how to do the steps and dance, so every age – grandparents and grandchildren, everybody will be participating.”\n\nMADRA received a grant of $1500 from the City of Whittlesea to host the event, which will be at Plenty Ranges Art and Convention Centre.\n\nFood and drink will be provided by local food vendors, with a donation encouraged.\n\nThe celebration will start at 7:30pm and end at 11pm at 35 Ferres Boulevard, South Morang.",

    "Why manufacturing is set to drive India's economy": "India's growth story over the last decade has been driven by rising consumption rather than investment. This was partly caused by the global financial crisis, when excesses were built into the system and overhangs occurred from 2008-2012 in capex-related industries. It also meant excessive corporate leverage funded by the banking system.\n\nIn response, we've seen a rise in bad loans and weaker balance sheets. This has meant consumption and, to some extent government spending, \"carried the can\" for growth during the 2010s.\n\nPersonal consumption was largely fuelled by banking services and credit funding from privately owned banks and non-bank financial companies. This led to a fantastic period for companies in these sectors. Stocks like HDFC Bank, Kotak Bank, Bajaj Finance, Hindustan Unilever, Asian Paints, Maruti Suzuki and Nestle rose in prominence and market cap over the decade. However, industries that are related, infrastructure or manufacturing-focused all suffered from stagnant demand and lack of private investment. As a result, India's GDP growth fell from over 8% to 3% in 2020 (pre-pandemic).\n\nIn the 2020s, the focus has shifted incrementally towards manufacturing and exports. Given the supply chain issues faced by the world due to the dominance of China, India and other countries like Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam are trying to seize the moment and integrate into global supply chains through either a structural advantage in labour costs or an edge in manufacturing, R&D or technology in value-added exports.\n\n\n\nThe Government of India has pivoted towards this post-COVID-19 by announcing its \"Atmanirbhar\" self-reliant philosophy, which focuses on manufacturing locally, reducing imports and seeking to increase exports to US$1 trillion per annum by 2030 (from the current US$350-400 billion pa today). When it came to power in 2014, the Narendra Modi-led BJP Government set up an initiative called \"Make-in-India\" which was focused on leveraging on India's strengths to manufacture more locally. This initiative has had mixed success in its initial years. However, cutting corporate taxes and taxes on new manufacturing projects in 2019 and introducing a Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme in 2021 to increase foreign interest in manufacturing locally in India in a JV with a local partner, are two areas that have the potential to increase India's integration into the global supply chain. Additionally, lowering the cost of doing business by cutting red tape and improving transparency and audit trail have led to rising levels of foreign direct investment than ever before.\n\nChart 1: Foreign Direct Investments into India US$bn\n\n\n\nCompanies like Apple NASDAQ: AAPL, Toyota, Samsung, Pfizer NASDAQ: PFE, Walmart NASDAQ: WMT and Amazon NASDAQ: AMZN are all making investments in India to build locally, which is likely to create additional employment opportunities and help boost India's GDP-per-capita from being 15 years behind where China is. Given India's huge market opportunities, these multinationals are seeking to lower their cost of production and enjoy lower taxes and fewer barriers to entry into India's lucrative long-term opportunity.\n\nIf India can address its manufacturing woes (which currently contributes less than 15% of GDP) and integrate more into global supply chains and use its skilled and unskilled labour to manufacture for the rest of the world, then its GDP-per-capita is set to experience a rise like China's in a more sustainable way, over the next two decades.\n\nThe chart below indicates that a corporate earnings recovery is underway after lagging GDP through the last decade. India has been one of those economies/markets where GDP and markets have tracked side-by-side over the longer term. This augurs well for investors looking to take advantage of India's increasing economic prominence on a global scale.\n\nMost actively managed funds will seek to invest in companies that are not just the Index heavyweights which tend to significantly represent the winners of the last decade. Whilst those companies may continue to be good investments due to the moat they have built, they may not necessarily capture the same share of incremental growth in the future.\n\nNever miss an insight\n\nIf you're not an existing Livewire subscriber you can sign up to get free access to investment ideas and strategies from Australia's leading investors.\n\nAnd you can follow my profile to stay up to date with other wires as they're published – don't forget to give them a “like”.",

    "Australia T20Is: India's batting progresses, bowling regresses": "A hard-fought 2-1 series victory over defending champions Australia has reaffirmed that India’s aggressive batting approach under captain Rohit Sharma and coach Rahul Dravid remains on track. However, with less than a month to go for their T20 World Cup opener against Pakistan in Melbourne, the familiar bowling frailties have left them looking somewhat vulnerable.\n\nWith just three more games against South Africa left before India board the plane to Australia, we take a look at some talking points from their latest contest.\n\nTop-order roles\n\nWith India having retained the same old top order for the T20 World Cup, there is no point in questioning the choice of personnel for now.\n\nIt is more about who plays what role now; going by the Australian series, it appears that openers Rohit and KL Rahul will go hard in the Powerplay, with the assurance that they have the solidity of Virat Kohli to follow at No 3 should an early wicket fall (The all-or-nothing approach does not come naturally to either Rahul or Rohit, but as the team management has stated several times, comfort zones are what India are aiming to get out of).\n\n“That’s why I’m batting at 3, I have to utilise my experience and give the team what the team wants,” Kohli said after anchoring India to victory in the series decider in Hyderabad on Sunday with a 48-ball 63.\n\nKohli let the T20 genius of Suryakumar Yadav blossom during their century partnership but made sure to launch a few aerial boundaries either side of the stand.\n\nHowever, the boundaries dried up at the death, and that is the risk India carry if Kohli bats that long.\n\nHe can go into wild slogging mode at times when the big hits are needed, and that has never been his game. He’s spoken about focusing on timing the ball into the gaps instead, and that is what India will want him to stick to.\n\nSo, at the moment, Kohli seems to be a kind of flexible anchor, which is probably the best way to utilise him if he is not opening.\n\nBlunt bowling\n\nWhile the pieces of the batting puzzle have more or less come together, the bowling has had the old clueless look when put under the pump. Twice against the towering reach and power of Cameron Green, in Mohali and Hyderabad, India had nowhere to turn to until considerable damage had been caused.\n\nLoss of form and injury comebacks have combined to make their bowling attack appear weaker than it actually is.\n\nOn paper, Jasprit Bumrah, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Harshal Patel and Arshdeep Singh are a pretty competent Powerplay and death bowling unit. But Bhuvneshwar is having to bowl more at the death than he usually would in the absence of the unfit Arshdeep, and Bumrah and Harshal are only just feeling their way back in from injury layoffs.\n\nLike the composition of the top order, the debate over whether this is the best pace attack for Australian conditions will have to wait until after the T20 World Cup. Heading into the tournament, India can only hope the selected personnel are fit and firing.\n\nAnd whether the inclusion of more pace in the form of Mohammed Shami will add bite is up in the air, as the senior pacer hasn’t played a single T20I since the 2021 World Cup and is now out of action for some more time with Covid. In any case, pace can disappear faster than it arrives in this format.\n\nThe Axar poser\n\nEven when India failed to defend 208 in Mohali, Axar Patel returned 3 for 17. Time and again, he’s shown himself to be a better T20 bowler than his senior Ravindra Jadeja but then, he is nowhere near the allrounder as a batsman. And that is only aggravating the serious lack of depth in India’s batting line-up.\n\nOn a couple of occasions now, they have saved Dinesh Karthik for the death and promoted Axar, but that doesn’t have the same impact as Jadeja’s comfort with batting at No 5 or 6.\n\nAnd playing neither R Ashwin nor Deepak Chahar means that for all practical purposes, India’s batting ends with Karthik, further heaping pressure on his already difficult finishing job.\n\nContrast that with the threat of Pat Cummins striding out at No 9 for Australia. It is all well when at least one of the top four is batting like a dream, as Suryakumar did in Hyderabad, but over the course of a World Cup, it is very difficult to replicate in a fickle format.\n\nNot only does it leave no insurance in the event of a collapse, it also makes the specialists that much more circumspect. India have got to find a way to bring in some more batting capability at No 8.\n\nOnly one keeper\n\nThe inevitable has happened, given the combination India have chosen to play. There is room for only one wicketkeeper-batsman, and Rishabh Pant has made way for Karthik, who doubles up as the specialist finisher.\n\nAnd going by what Rohit said on Sunday, Pant will play only if India determine the opposition match-ups merit a left-hander.

    "The people resurrecting India's ancient fruit trees": "It can take an entire village to grow a new-age garden. That’s what 42-year-old Shyju Machathi, a policeman living in Kannapuram in the Southern Indian state of Kerala, found out when his town was declared an \"Indigenous Mango Heritage Area\" by the Kerala State Biodiversity Board in 2020.\n\nThe honour came after the villagers had got together to grow over 200 indigenous species of mangoes, sourced from surrounding towns and villages, preserving diverse varieties that were in danger of dying out.\n\nThe technique that made it possible, Machathi says, is the age-old art of grafting. He started experimenting with the technique in July 2016, despite no formal training in farming, after an unfortunate incident shook the village of Kannapuram.\n\nA neighbour had hacked down a 200-year-old mango tree known locally as Vellathan, which grew in his home. \"The tree had produced the sweetest mangos I’ve ever tasted,\" says Machathi. \"It was exquisite, an endemic native variety that was very rare.\" But it was also undeniably old. Parts of the large tree would come hurtling to the ground, making it such a hazard that the neighbour decided that it needed to be chopped down for his peace of mind. \"The tree was so much a part of our growing years, the landscape of our lives that we were all just shocked over losing it overnight,\" says Machathi.\n\nStaring at the wasted branches the next morning, and feeling a deep sense of loss, Machathi reached out to a friend who was working as an agricultural officer with the Kerala government. There was a way to save the tree, his friend said. If they could graft portions of the tree onto a growing mango plant with a sturdy root, they could regenerate the old tree and one day, savour its exquisite fruit again.",

    "India goes its own way on global geopolitics": "Author: Deepa M Ollapally, GWU\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine coincided with a debate over whether to call US–China tensions ‘a new Cold War’ and a ‘no limits’ friendship between Russia and China. As the United States raced to place sanctions on Moscow, many in the Global South found themselves caught in the crosshairs of a realignment against Russia.\n\nAmong the non-committed, India is the largest democracy to strike its own path.\n\nRussia has been one of India’s most steadfast diplomatic and defence partners and a weakened Russia would negate India’s preference for a multipolar global order in which it is an independent and influential pole. Washington’s tendency to group China and Russia as an ‘authoritarian axis’ that threatens the global order is not something to which India subscribes. India sees Russia as a close friend and China as an adversary, while the United States is hostile to both countries.\n\nSince the invasion of Ukraine, the contradiction between India and the United States is playing out openly. India and China have been more aligned on UN votes, with India abstaining on 11 UN votes to condemn Russia, withstanding intense pressure from its closest Western partners as well as unflattering international media and public opinion.\n\nIndia could not be persuaded to join the US-led economic sanctions against Russia as it is generally against unilateral sanctions levied outside the United Nations. New Delhi’s decision to accept Russia’s offer of deeply discounted oil is not entirely surprising, though Western officials and commentators have accused India of taking ‘sweet deals’ from an otherwise diplomatically isolated Russia and indirectly funding Putin’s war machine.\n\nThe West’s pressure on India went from pure money to values by characterising the conflict as between authoritarianism and democracy. In a much-watched interaction between visiting British Foreign Minster Liz Truss and Indian Minister of External Affairs Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, Truss took a swipe at India’s neutral stance, stating that ‘it’s vitally important for freedom and democracy in Europe, that we challenge Putin, and we ensure that he loses in Ukraine’.\n\nIndia’s strategic ties with the United States and its embrace of the Quad once suggested an increasing acceptance of the US-dominated liberal order and a weakening commitment to a multipolar world. India and China’s growing adversarial relations also pointed to the limits of their cooperation on global governance and reform.\n\nBut Ukraine shows that India’s desire for multipolarity remains. India continues to be a dissatisfied member of the liberal global order despite having made gains through that order. At the June 2022 Bratislava Forum, Jaishankar argued that ‘Europe has to grow out of the mindset that its problems are the world’s problems, but the world’s problems aren’t Europe’s problems’.\n\nIndia is the only major power to have membership in organisations that are generally seen by the West as competitive, if not adversarial. Along with BRICS, it is part of the East Asia Summit, the ASEAN Regional Forum, the Quad and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.\n\nThis wide-ranging membership exemplifies India’s decision to represent and protect its foreign policymaking autonomy and pursue greater global power-sharing. The Russia–China statement — issued after the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics — recognises Indian autonomy and prioritises the relations between the three big powers within the BRICS. In a telling final paragraph, it stated that Russia and China ‘intend to develop cooperation within the ‘Russia–India–China’ format’.\n\nIndia’s decision to participate in the weeklong military drill hosted by Russia in September 2022 did not sit well with its Quad partners. The United States expressed its displeasure over India taking part in the drills, stating it has concerns about any country ‘exercising with Russia while Russia wages an unprovoked, brutal war against Ukraine’. But US Press Secretary Karine Jean Pierre added that ‘every participating country will make its own decisions’, suggesting that the United States would not interfere.\n\nJapan strongly objected to the drills in the Sea of Okhotsk and the Sea of Japan, calling them ‘unacceptable’. In deference to Japan’s sensitivities, India elected to stay away from the maritime component of the Vostok exercises and did not send its warships.\n\nThe balancing act between Russia and the West seems to be paying off. There was a flurry of high-level visitors to New Delhi in March and April 2022, including the prime ministers of Japan and the United Kingdom, foreign ministers of China and Russia and a virtual summit with Australia’s Prime Minister. But India’s foreign policy decisions are testing these partnerships and expectations.\n\nThere are political minefields ahead for India and its partners. NATO–Russia tensions will surely rise when Sweden and Finland’s requests for membership are taken up. An intensification of the Russia–Ukraine war might force India to choose between its Quad partners and Russia.\n\nIndia’s earlier intention to achieve multipolarity through the BRICS will be even less tenable if Russia–China relations become ironclad. The notion of a more distributed power system will collide against the reality that closer ties with the United States may appear a better option for India.\n\nAt the beginning of the Russia–Ukraine war, India worried that China would gain an enfeebled and dependent Russia as a junior partner. New Delhi stood to lose Russia as a strong and reliable geopolitical partner. Economically, the sanctions on Russia are setting off a process of de-dollarisation that benefits China. The Ukraine conflict could deliver advantages to China that it could not have otherwise secured.\n\nIndian policymakers are betting that Russia will not want to put all its eggs in one basket and that Russia will continue to respect India’s independence. A weakened Russia will still have veto power at the UN Security Council where India has historically been a beneficiary.\n\nIndia is betting that the level of convergence with the Quad members on China’s aggression in the Indo-Pacific is strong enough for them to tolerate dissonance on other grounds. It is counting on its friends to realise that pressure to take sides is unlikely to produce results and may backfire.\n\nIndia has consolidated its strategic autonomy without economic or strategic costs. Its Quad partners appear willing to tolerate differences — after all, there is no ‘Indo-Pacific’ without India.\n\nNew Delhi has been able to set the terms of global engagement in the current geopolitical constellation. But depending on the outcome of the Ukraine war, India’s conception of the type of global order that guards its strategic autonomy may have to be reluctantly refined.\n\nDeepa M Ollapally is Research Professor of International Affairs and Director of the Rising Powers Initiative at the Elliott School of International Affairs, George Washington University.",

    "Exclusive: India's push for home-grown navigation system jolts smartphone giants": "NavIC (Navigation with Indian Constellation) and GPS (Global Positioning System) logos are seen in this illustration taken, September 25, 2022. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration\n\nSummary\n\nSummary Companies India wants local GPS rival in smartphones; industry fears costs\n\nSmartphone players want delay to New Delhi's Jan. 2023 deadline\n\nSamsung, others say Indian system needs hardware changes-sources\n\nBoosting native system part of Modi's self-reliance campaign\n\nNEW DELHI, Sept 26 (Reuters) - India is pushing tech giants to make smartphones compatible with its home-grown navigation system within months, worrying the likes of Samsung, Xiaomi and Apple who fear elevated costs and disruptions as the move requires hardware changes, according to two industry sources and government documents seen by Reuters.\n\nIn line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's drive for self-reliance, India has over the years expanded the use of its regional navigation satellite system called NavIC (Navigation with Indian Constellation).\n\nThe Indian government wants to reduce dependence on foreign systems, including the widely used U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS), and says NavIC provides more accurate domestic navigation and that its use would benefit the economy.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nChina, the European Union, Japan and Russia have their own global or regional navigation systems to rival GPS. Operational since 2018, NavIC's uptake is minimal; it is mandated in public vehicle location trackers, for example.\n\nBut government and industry documents show Modi's administration and space officials want to broaden its use, and have this year pushed smartphone giants to make hardware changes to support NavIC, in addition to GPS, in new phones they will sell from January 2023.\n\nIn private meetings in August and September, representatives of Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Xiaomi Corp (1810.HK), Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) and others pushed back, citing worries that making phones NavIC-compliant would mean higher research and production costs.\n\nThe changes would also require more testing clearances, which with a Jan. 1 deadline would disrupt businesses and planned launches, according to two smartphone industry sources and documents.\n\nSamsung declined comment on the meetings, while Apple and Xiaomi did not respond to requests for comment. India's IT ministry and the space agency ISRO that are both involved in the project also did not respond.\n\nSamsung in particular voiced concerns during a Sept. 2 closed-door meeting between top smartphone players and chipmakers with Indian IT ministry and space agency officials, according to the meeting's minutes reviewed by Reuters.\n\nSamsung's India executive Binu George warned of cost worries, telling officials that NavIC support requires not just new smartphone chipsets but also many other components.\n\n\"This would add to cost as it requires hardware design changes and additional investments to support devices specific to India. Further, the companies have already prepared for models to be launched in 2024,\" the minutes quoted him as saying.\n\nGeorge did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe smartphone players have sought time until 2025 to implement the changes, and a final decision is expected in coming days, a senior government official said.\n\nThe minutes said the Indian space agency will provide technical support for implementing NavIC in new smartphones, adding another meeting may be called.\n\nINDIA VS OTHERS\n\nIndia's space agency has said systems like GPS and Russia's GLONASS are operated by their countries' defence agencies, making it possible for civilian service to be interrupted.\n\nNavIC, it says, is fully under the control of the Indian government, which one day wants to take it global like GPS.\n\nIndia would not be the first country to push smartphone makers to add support for a native navigation system.\n\nRussia has sought to mandate inclusion of its own GLONASS system in smartphones sold locally to reduce reliance on GPS, which Washington can switch off for civilian subscribers as it did during military operations in Iraq.\n\nChina's Beidou was completed in June 2020, and, though not mandated, the official Xinhua news agency has reported that in 2021, 94.5% of China-made smartphones had Beidou support.\n\nXiaomi and Samsung together account for 38% of the smartphone market in India, the world's second biggest after China. Apple's more expensive smartphones have a roughly 3% share in India, data from Hong Kong-based research firm Counterpoint shows.\n\nOther Chinese manufactures making up a further 28% of the market were also present at the Sept. 2 meeting, government minutes show. China's Realme, which has a 16% market share, did not attend, and neither did smaller manufacturers.\n\nApple's website says it already supports the five global and regional navigation networks including GPS, GLONASS and BeiDou in current iPhones. The Indian directive could force it to add a new one.\n\nA key concern for players like Samsung and Xiaomi remains the higher cost of so-called dual band chipsets they would need to support both GPS and NavIC, as these companies are leaders in the sub-$200 category in India's price-sensitive market, the smartphone industry sources said.\n\nCHIPSET CONCERN\n\nFor procuring NavIC-compliant chipsets, most smartphone makers are reliant on global giants such as U.S. chip designer Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) and Taiwan's MediaTek Inc (2454.TW).\n\nVoluntary use of such chipsets has been limited in India as phone manufacturers remain hesitant to add the extra components - and cost - required to make it work, said Parv Sharma, senior semiconducter analyst at Counterpoint.\n\nIndia's space agency said that by mid-2021, only about two dozen mobile handset models in India had NavIC capability. In total there are around 300, Counterpoint has said.\n\nDuring the Sept. 2 meeting, MediaTek said all of the company's chipsets for 5G phones would support NavIC, with \"some cost enhancement\" and additional hardware. MediaTek added that it expected about 80% of mobile phones to be 5G-enabled in two years.\n\nMediaTek declined to comment on Reuters queries. Qualcomm in a statement said it has been working with the Indian space agency to enable NavIC on its chipsets for years and will continue to do so.\n\nAnother lobbying push from smartphone players is to convince the Indian government to make NavIC available on the so-called L1 satellite frequency which is already used by GPS, and not onlyon the L5 frequency used by New Delhi.\n\nThat, executives say, will make it easier for manufacturers to integrate NavIC in chipsets which mostly support the L1 band the world over, curbing separate development costs for NavIC.\n\nIndian space agency ISRO told the Sept. 2 gathering that was not immediately possible, as NavIC was likely to be available on the L1 band only by 2024-25, after more satellite launches, the meeting's record shows.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nReporting by Munsif Vengattil and Aditya Kalra in New Delhi; Editing by Mike Collett-White and Raju Gopalakrishnan\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
    "India is repurposing its COVID-19 contact tracing app and vaccination website": "India is repurposing its COVID-19 contact-tracing app and vaccination website to address other health concerns in the South Asian country.\n\nA senior official said Sunday that the Indian government is planning to use Aarogya Setu as the country’s standalone health app.\n\nThe app will offer residents the ability to book medical checkup appointments and verify the registrations with QR codes to avoid waiting in queues at hospitals, RS Sharma, the chief executive of the National Health Authority, the body that oversees implementation of the country’s flagship public health scheme, said at a public event.\n\nAarogya Setu, launched in 2020, has amassed more than 240 million downloads, he said. The app was initially launched as a “temporary solution to a temporary problem.”\n\nShortly after its launch, Aarogya Setu, which means “bridge to health” in Sanskrit, attracted some concerns from privacy advocates over the app’s tracking of individuals. New Delhi dismissed the concerns and said at the time that the so-called flaws were implemented in the app by design.

Yuzvendra Chahal was the only other bowler in the entire match to go for less than 7.50 runs-an-over.\n\nOf course, all the usual cricket caveats apply. This was a series in India, not Australia, where the World Cup will be played in vastly different conditions.\n\nFurthermore, this was a series that favoured the batters with plenty of big totals across the board.\n\nNonetheless, it’s hard to imagine that if selectors were picking Australia’s squad now, and not four weeks ago, Green wouldn’t be included.\n\nAt the time, Green had only played one T20I, and was yet to post unbeaten scores of 89 and 25 in the ODI series against New Zealand.\n\nGiven his precocious talent, this is now a selection conundrum that we probably should’ve seen coming.\n\nEven if Green wasn’t to be shoehorned into Australia’s XI, his spot as a squad member now feels like a no-brainer.\n\nHe can bat virtually anywhere in the order, he bowls, and is an exceptional fielder.\n\nAustralia now returns to play two series against the West Indies and England at home before the World Cup starts.\n\nAs things stand, Green is not even a part of the squad for those series with David Warner returning after skipping the tour of India.\n\nTime will tell if selectors are willing to shake up their plans to give Green a final look in Australian conditions.\n\nIf nothing else, it might’ve been a million-dollar performance from Green anyway.\n\nGreen blasting runs from the top of the order in Indian conditions will not go unnoticed by franchise owners in the Indian Premier League.\n\nHis value could be immense come next year’s IPL auction.\n\nWAS TIM DAVID WORTH THE WAIT?\n\nFew white ball players have garnered more hype before even playing a game for Australia than Tim David.\n\nAs such, he had plenty to live up to in India where his debut series didn’t hit the lofty heights that many were expecting.\n\nNonetheless, he ended the series on the right note with a timely reminder of why he’s been added to Australia’s World Cup squad.\n\nThe big-hitter blasted 54 runs in a 27-ball innings that included four sixes and two fours. His runs came at a crucial time, too, with Australia wobbling at 4-84 after 9.2 overs.\n\nIt comes to the surprise of no one — he’s been blasting runs against quality bowlers in T20 leagues across the world — but David is undoubtedly up to international standard.\n\nWhether he cracks into Australia’s XI at the World Cup could come down to performances in the series against the West Indies and England.\n\nDavid has been a run machine in 2022 but many of his runs have come playing in Pakistan and India in their respective domestic T20 leagues.\n\nReplicating that in Australia could be the final box for David to tick to force selectors into tweaking the team’s batting order.\n\nAs for where David could fit in, the options are emerging (see below).\n\nSHOULD GLENN MAXWELL BE A LOCK?\n\nProbably not.\n\nTrue that Maxwell’s extra risk-taking has made him a soft target in the past, while talk of him underperforming for Australia is somewhat overblown.\n\nAfter all, this is a two-time World Cup winner averaging 29.33 in T20Is and 34.13 in ODIs, while he strikes at over 150 in the former.\n\nBut Maxwell’s form has been patchy-to-poor in recent times and, while his potential is extraordinary, no player should be a lock on promise alone.\n\nWhich brings us to here: Maxwell just averaged 2.33 across three innings, and faced only 15 balls all series.\n\nHe averages 25.41 across both white ball formats in 2022, although that number is somewhat inflated by unbeaten scores of 48 and 80 against Sri Lanka in the first half of the year.\n\nSince the start of last month’s ODI series against Zimbabwe, Maxwell’s average slips to 14.14.\n\nHe was also a quiet performer for Australia at last year’s World Cup, averaging 16.00 while striking at a run-a-ball. Only bowlers Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins and Adam Zampa averaged less for Australia.\n\nThe India series doesn’t suddenly place Maxwell on the chopping block, especially given he’s a tidy bowler and an outstanding fielder — neither of which should be understated.\n\nNonetheless, the emergence of David means he shouldn’t be considered safe either.\n\nWHAT ABOUT STEVE SMITH?\n\nIn a similar boat to Maxwell is Smith, who will also be looking over his shoulder.\n\nSmith’s value as a T20 player has been debated in recent times with some of the world’s most dangerous sides snubbing the ‘anchor’ role.\n\nWith David waiting for his chance, Smith’s name has been thrown up as the player who could come out of Australia’s top seven to make it more aggressive, and to follow the lead of more explosive teams.\n\nFormer selector Mark Waugh is among those who believe David should be squeezed into Australia’s XI at the World Cup, saying earlier this month: “I’ve got him in the team. I would start with him.\n\n“I’ve got him in which means another player would miss out who’d be unlucky but yeah, I’d like to see him in there.”\n\nAsked who could make way, Waugh said: “Well you’ve got (Marcus) Stoinis or Steve Smith potentially.”\n\nStoinis missed the tour of India with injury and has also been out of form, making ODI scores of 19, 3, 5 and 0 against Zimbabwe and New Zealand.\n\nHe did, however, average 80.00 at last year’s World Cup with a strike rate of 137.93 — and is still considered a dangerous weapon in the Australian middle-order.\n\nSmith was in great ODI form earlier this month, while he started the series against India with 35 runs off 24 balls.

    "Samsung launches credit card in India": "Samsung has launched two credit cards in India, entering a crowded category that sees more than 50 companies fiercely compete for consumers’ attention in the world’s second largest internet market.\n\nThe South Korean giant said it has partnered with the Mumbai-headquartered Axis Bank and global payments processor Visa to launch the cards, which it is calling the Samsung Axis Bank Credit Card. Consumers buying Samsung’s products and services through either of the cards will get 10% cash back “round the year,” the company executives said at an event in New Delhi.\n\n(There is a monthly cap of 2,500 Indian rupees [$31] on the Signature card, whereas the Infinite card extends that limit by four times. The cash back is capped yearly at 10,000 Indian rupees [$123] on the Signature card, and 20,000 Indian rupees [$246] on Infinite card.)\n\nSamsung, the second largest smartphone vendor in India, said it will also offer customers “exciting” financing options on the credit cards. The cards are especially aimed at serving consumers in smaller Indian cities and towns, the executives said.\n\nEven as the space Samsung is entering is crowded, the opportunity is undoubtably large. Indian banks have issued over a billion debit cards to customers in the country, but fewer than 25 million unique individuals in the nation have a credit card, according to industry estimates.\n\nCustomers will earn rewards for spendings through their cards and get access to deals from local firms, including food delivery service Zomato, fashion e-commerce Myntra, online pharmacy Tata’s 1mg, grocer Bigbasket and Urban Company.\n\nMonday’s announcement underscores smartphone makers’ growing attempt to broaden their services. Chinese giant Xiaomi, which commands the smartphone market in the country, launched a UPI-powered payments service in India in 2019 and started to lend to customers last year. (Samsung launched its payments service Samsung Pay, powered by UPI, in India in 2017.)\n\nCo-branded cards are generally “a win-win for the bank, the partner brand and the customers” as it allows power users of a brand to get higher benefits as they spend more with the brand.\n\n“The brand gets more loyalty from its users, while the bank obviously benefits by getting access to a different set of customer base with the customer acquisition itself coming from the brand or the brand’s loyalist users,” a Bengaluru-based fintech executive told TechCrunch, requesting anonymity commenting on other company’s products.\n\nThe annual fee on Signature card is $6.13 before taxes, whereas the Infinite card levies a charge 10 times that. The company said it will soon start accepting applications from customers for the cards.\n\n“At Samsung, we believe in transforming the lives of our consumers through the power of innovation. The Samsung Axis Bank Credit Card, powered by Visa, is our next big India-specific innovation that will change the way our customers buy Samsung products and spend on services through a series of industry-leading features. We’re excited to be able to put the control into our consumers’ hands,” said Ken Kang, President and CEO, Samsung South-West Asia, in a statement.",
    "GT Voice: India’s call for global debt relief laudable, West must step up too": "Photo: VCG\n\nIndian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said on Saturday that with India set to assume the presidency of the G20, the South Asian nation will work with other G20 member states to address serious issues of debt, food and energy security, Indian media outlets reported on Sunday.\"The accumulation of debt in fragile economies is of particular concern,\" Jaishankar said in his address to the UN General Assembly session on Saturday.His call for global debt relief efforts, which came at a time when global debt levels have soared significantly, especially in a number of vulnerable developing countries, is laudable, considering the growing urgency for Western countries, developing countries and multilateral institutions to work together to find appropriate ways to restructure and ease debt burdens on some emerging market economies to avoid further crisis.While the US has often been critical of China's debt relief efforts to low and middle-income countries, the fact is that the developed world is largely responsible for the debt woes faced by the emerging market economies and thus should take more responsibility for their debt relief.Early in January, Gita Gopinath, first deputy managing director of the IMF, said that 60 percent of low-income countries were in or at high risk of debt distress, and would find it increasingly difficult to service their debts.With central banks in the developed world, such as the US Federal Reserve, raising interest rates aggressively this year, developing countries have faced more debt pressure exacerbated by currency depreciation, imported inflationary pressure, and further downward economic pressure.Moreover, developing countries mainly borrow from Western commercial and multilateral lenders. According to the World Bank's International Debt Statistics, by the end of 2020, commercial and multilateral creditors accounted for 40 percent and 34 percent, respectively, for the public external debt of 82 low-income and lower middle-income countries.Also, these Western commercial creditors and multilateral institutions, which hold the biggest share of debts, claimed they need to maintain their credit rating and have been absent from the global debt relief and service suspension effort for developing countries. By comparison, China has been implementing the G20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative and is the biggest contributor to the effort.Western countries always like to pay lip service when it comes to tackling global challenges as if they are the saviors of the world, but deflecting responsibility when it comes to global debt relief efforts. They are reluctant to actually do something to be the savior, because it may probably conflict with their own selfish interests.Against this backdrop, developing countries, including China and India, may need to play a greater role in terms of debt relief coordination and collaboration.In particular, India has been stepping up efforts in easing debt burden and helping some developing countries like Sri Lanka. With a total of $968 million in loans in four months of 2022, India \"has emerged as Sri Lanka's largest bilateral lender, overtaking China in the process,\" India's ANI news agency reported last week.To a certain extent, India's increased sense of responsibility for the developing world may have something to do with its bullish economic performance. India has overtaken the UK to become the world's fifth-largest economy, according to the latest calculations by Bloomberg. The Indian economy grew 13.5 percent in the second quarter of this year, making it the fastest growing economy in the G20.Meanwhile, China's efforts on debt relief for developing countries have been steady and effective. Last month, China announced the waiving of 23 interest-free loans for 17 African countries that had matured at the end of 2021.The willingness shared by China and India to take greater responsibility for the debt problems in the developing world may also provide the potential for the two to strength their coordination in this area for alleviating the debt burden on other economies. Both sides may play their due roles of coordinating debt relief and restructuring with other developing countries under such platforms as the BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.",
    "What are the functions of the Attorney General for India?": "Senior Advocate Mukul Rohatgi has declined the government’s offer to be Attorney General (A-G) for India after “second thoughts”. Rohatgi, who had earlier agreed to take up the position, told The Indian Express on Sunday (September 25) that there was “no specific reason” for changing his mind.\n\nThe term of the incumbent A-G, K K Venugopal, ends on September 30. He is 91 years old, and on his third extension. Venugopal has conveyed to the government that in view of his advanced age, he would not be able to continue after the end of his current term.\n\nWho is the Attorney General for India?\n\nThe Constitution of India places the post of the A-G on a special footing. The A-G is the Government of India’s first law officer, and has the right of audience in all courts of the country.\n\nArticle 76(2) of the Constitution says “it shall be the duty of the Attorney-General to give advice to the Government of India upon such legal matters, and to perform such other duties of a legal character, as may from time to time be referred or assigned to him by the President”.\n\nThe A-G is also supposed to “discharge the functions conferred on him by or under this Constitution or any other law for the time being in force”.\n\nUnder Article 88, the “Attorney-General of India shall have the right to speak in, and otherwise to take part in the proceedings of, either House, any joint sitting of the Houses, and any committee of Parliament of which he may be named a member”. However, he “shall not by virtue of this article be entitled to vote” in the House.\n\nAlso, the A-G for India is not, like the A-G for England and Wales and the A-G of the United States, a member of the Cabinet.\n\nWho can become A-G?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnder Article 76(1), the A-G is appointed by the President from among persons who are “qualified to be appointed a Judge of the Supreme Court”. Article 76(4) says “the Attorney-General shall hold office during the pleasure of the President, and shall receive such remuneration as the President may determine.”\n\nThe post of the A-G has been occupied by some of the finest jurists in India’s history. The first two incumbents of the post were the legendary M C Setalvad and C K Daphtary.\n\nSoli Sorabjee served as A-G twice, in 1989-90 when V P Singh and Chandra Shekhar were Prime Ministers, and from 1998-2004 under Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

    "Dependence on Russian defence equipment not lack of trying on India’s part: Jaishankar": "India’s dependence on Russian defence equipment and the strong defence ties with Moscow is not because New Delhi did not approach the US to get those from the United States, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said Sunday.\n\n“One of the changes in our relationships has actually been the defence cooperation which has really come about in this current form maybe the last 15 years,” Jaishankar told Indian Americans here during an interactive discussion with him organized by the US India Friendship Council and Foundation for India and Indian Diaspora Studies.\n\n“From 1965 pretty much for the next 40 years, there was no US defence equipment to India. This was, in fact, a period when the India Soviet, India Russia relationship became very strong,” he said.\n\n“This was not due to a lack of trying on India’s part. I can vouch for it myself. I’ve had my relatives, my father, my grandfather, they worked with the defence ministry. So, I know firsthand what great efforts were made over those years to try to make the US understand that it was in American interest to have a strong, united, independent, prosperous India,” Jaishankar said.\n\n“At that time, they did not succeed, maybe the state of the world was such,” he noted. “The change that started was really triggered by the nuclear deal that removed a very big obstacle to go forward and then to actually take the relationship to a new level requires leadership in India,” that did not had reservations.\n\n“It takes two hands to clap. It was not just that all the problems are on the American side they were visitations on the Indian side as well,” he said.\n\n“So we also have to address the institutions on our side. I think today, the relationship is on a very different footing. We have possibility of working together in many more areas, especially the security domain. Some of our major exercises are with the American military. We fly a number of American planes today, the C 17,” the minister said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVery bullish on the future of India-US relationship, he said: “I think there are really deep convergences, which will sustain it over many, many years.”",
    "Clues in Caves Suggest Drought May Have Brought Down India’s Mughal Empire": "This story was originally published on The Conversation and appears here under a Creative Commons license.\n\nIn a remote cave in northeast India, rainwater has slowly dripped from the ceiling in the same spots for over 1,000 years. With each drop, minerals in the water accumulate on the floor below, slowly growing into calcium carbonate towers known as stalagmites. These stalagmites are more than geological wonders—like tree rings, their layers record the region’s rainfall history. They also carry a warning about the potential for catastrophic multiyear droughts in the future.\n\nBy analyzing the geochemistry of these stalagmites in a new study published this month in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, we were able to create the most precise chronology yet of the summer Indian monsoon over the past millennium. It documents how the Indian subcontinent frequently experienced long, severe droughts unlike any observed in the last 150 years of reliable monsoon rainfall measurements.\n\nThe drought periods we detected are in striking synchrony with historical accounts of droughts, famines, mass mortality events, and geopolitical changes in the region.\n\nThey show how the decline of the Mughal Empire and India’s textile industries in the 1780s and 1790s coincided with the most severe 30-year period of drought over the millennium. The depth and duration of the drought would have caused widespread crop failures and the level of famine discussed in written documents at the time.\n\nAnother long drought encompasses the 1630-1632 Deccan famine, one of the most devastating droughts in India’s history. Millions of people died as crops failed. Around the same time, the elaborate Mughal capital of Fatehpur Sikri was abandoned and the Guge Kingdom collapsed in western Tibet.\n\nBuland Darwaza (Door of Victory) at Fatehpur Sikri, the one-time capital of the Mughal Empire. Marcin Białek, CC BY-SA 3.0/Wikimedia\n\nOur findings have important implications today for water planning in a warming world, particularly for India, which, with its vast monsoon-reliant agriculture industry, is on pace to soon be the most populous country on the planet.\n\nScientists began systematically measuring India’s monsoon rainfall with instruments around the 1870s. Since then, India has experienced about 27 regionally widespread droughts. Among them, only one—1985 to 1987—was a three-year consecutive drought or worse.\n\nThe apparent stability of the Indian monsoon in that data might lead one to surmise that neither protracted droughts lasting multiple years nor frequent droughts are intrinsic aspects of its variability. This seemingly reassuring view currently informs the region’s present-day water resource infrastructure.\n\nHowever, the stalagmite evidence of prolonged, severe droughts over the past 1,000 years paints a different picture. It indicates that the short instrumental period does not capture the full range of Indian monsoon variability. It also raises questions about the region’s current water resources, sustainability, and mitigation policies that discount the possibility of protracted droughts in the future.\n\nTo reconstruct past variations in rainfall, we analyzed stalagmites from Mawmluh Cave, near the town of Cherrapunji in the state of Meghalaya—one of the wettest locations in the world.\n\nStalagmites marked for study inside Mawmluh Cave. Gayatri Kathayat\n\nStalagmites are cone-like structures that grow slowly from the ground up, typically at a rate of about one millimeter every 10 years. Trapped within their growth layers are minute amounts of uranium and other elements that were acquired as rainwater infiltrated the rocks and soil above the cave. Over time, uranium trapped in stalagmites decays into thorium at a predictable pace, so we can figure out the age of each stalagmite growth layer by measuring the ratio of uranium to thorium.\n\nThe oxygen in rainwater molecules comes in two primary types of isotopes: heavy and light. As stalagmites grow, they lock into their structure the oxygen isotope ratios of the percolating rainwater that seeps into the cave. Subtle variations in this ratio can arise from a range of climatic conditions at the time the rainwater originally fell.\n\nOur previous research in this area showed that variations in oxygen isotope ratios in rainwater, and consequently, in stalagmites, track changes in the relative abundance of different moisture sources that contribute to summer monsoon rainfall.\n\nDuring years when monsoon circulation is weak, rainfall here is primarily derived from the moisture that evaporated from the nearby Arabian Sea. During strong monsoon years, however, atmospheric circulation brings copious amounts of moisture to this area all the way from the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nThe two moisture sources have quite different oxygen isotope signatures, and this ratio is faithfully preserved in the stalagmites. We can use this clue to learn about the overall strength of the monsoon intensity at the time the stalagmite formed. We pieced together the monsoon rainfall history by extracting minute amounts of calcium carbonate from its growth rings and then measuring the oxygen isotope ratios. To anchor our climate record to precise calendar years, we measured the uranium and thorium ratio.\n\nA cross-section of a stalagmite shows variations in ring formation, which can be linked to changing climate conditions. Gayatri Kathayat\n\nThe paleoclimate records can usually tell what, where and when something happened. But often, they alone cannot answer why or how something happened. Our new study shows that protracted droughts frequently occurred during the past millennia, but we do not have a good understanding of why the monsoon failed in those years. Similar studies using Himalayan ice cores, tree rings, and other caves have also detected protracted droughts but face the same challenge.\n\nIn the next phase of our study, we are teaming up with climate modelers to conduct coordinated proxy-modeling studies that we hope will offer more insight into the climate dynamics that triggered and sustained such extended periods of drought during the past millennium.\n\nGayatri Kathayat is an associate professor of global environmental change at Xi’an Jiaotong University.

    "Are China and India changing their stance on Putin's war in Ukraine?": "Listen 6 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nEarlier this month, Vladimir Putin met one-on-one with Xi Jinping and Narendra Modi as the three world leaders attended a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. For the first time, Putin publicly admitted that China had “questions and concerns” about the continuing war in Ukraine. Likewise, Modi reminded Putin that the present era is “not one of war.”\n\nThese developments are noteworthy. Until now, China has openly supported Russia, while India has avoided public criticism of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. During the summit, Modi reaffirmed the historic importance of India-Russia relations. And China’s Foreign Affairs Ministry issued a statement calling the China-Russia relationship “stable as mountains.” Both countries continue to buy Russian exports in large quantities. They even joined military exercises in Russia this month.\n\nWhy have China and India been so reluctant to rein Moscow in? While their dependence on Russia for defense and energy resources are significant factors, my research suggests that status also plays a role in their policies. India and China share Russia’s resentment about their second-tier status in a U.S.-led international order. That makes both countries likely to continue to be tolerant about Moscow’s ambitions.\n\nNot defending the international order is risky\n\nIt may seem that security and economic factors are driving Beijing and New Delhi’s policies. But Moscow’s war in Ukraine has disrupted the economies of both China and India. The conflict has affected food and energy supplies worldwide, raising the price of oil and other commodities for India and China. Bankrolling a warring country with mounting economic problems is risky — Russia’s collapse, for instance, would also hurt partner countries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussia’s invasion also jeopardizes the international order, by disrupting the settled rules and norms that govern relations between countries. Moscow’s actions have challenged foundational international principles such as sovereignty, territorial integrity and self-determination. Russia has also announced its intention to withdraw from the World Trade Organization and World Health Organization, institutions that are core to the international order. In that light, it’s surprising that China and India would support Putin’s efforts to undermine the very order that has enabled their rise.\n\nRising powers won’t support an exclusionary order\n\nHistory shows, however, that rising powers like China and India do not simply value economic and security goals. They also value being recognized as eminent countries with an elevated status in international politics. In my recent book, I show that this status comes from being recognized as equals of the great powers that manage the international order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen core institutions of the international order recognize a rising country’s equality — typically by including these new aspirants in global leadership positions — they’re likely to uphold the order, even at great cost to themselves. When the order instead excludes these countries, they will demand greater representation in the governance of global issues and will be less willing to cooperate. If these demands are denied or indefinitely deferred, they may get frustrated and challenge the order.\n\nThe United States itself was once in this position, in the 19th century. Initially, it cooperated with a mostly inclusive international order. As a club of European great powers took over after 1815, the U.S. sought — unsuccessfully — to transform international law as a way of joining the club. Feeling unfairly excluded, the U.S. eventually challenged the order. In 1856, when Britain and France introduced new rules abolishing the use of private vessels in maritime warfare, the U.S. vehemently opposed the effort and refused to cooperate. At the time, private vessels provided the only source of equality the U.S. had with the naval powers of Europe.\n\nChina and India see the current order as exclusionary\n\nChina and India today are looking for opportunities for leadership in a global order dominated by the U.S. and its allies. New Delhi, for example, seeks a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council. India’s foreign minister declared in 2020 that India deserved “due recognition” for its contributions to global order, and called for “reformed multilateralism.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeijing, already a permanent Security Council member, seeks greater representation in international financial institutions such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Asian Development Bank, whose top leadership positions have been exclusively occupied by American, European and Japanese nationals, respectively. Indeed, scholars have found that since 1971, the year China joined the United Nations, senior management positions within the U.N. system have been held largely by nationals of the U.S., France, U.K., Japan and Canada, with China, India and Russia trailing far behind.\n\nFrustrated that these institutions have been slow to change in this regard, China launched the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank in 2014. When the U.S. pressured other countries to boycott the institution, China’s vice minister of commerce compared the international order to a basketball game in which “the U.S. wants to set the duration of the game, the size of the court, the height of the basket and everything else to suit itself.”\n\nChina, India and Russia prefer a ‘multipolar’ order\n\nSo long as the international order continues to exclude China and India from the great power club, these nations have little incentive to defend rules and institutions that they did not create and over which they feel little ownership. Since the end of the Cold War, China and India have joined Russia in consistently declaring their preference for a “multipolar world order,” which would give them a greater say in global affairs.\n\nAt the same time, there are limits to how far China and India will go. The recent Shanghai Cooperation summit shows that Russia may be pushing its friends too far, and they are beginning to push back. The need to protect their own longer-term interests and to successfully transform — but not wreck — the international order may now be leading both countries to restrain Moscow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHistory shows that rising powers do not wait indefinitely for their place in the sun. Without some accommodation of their status aspirations, China and India are likely to remain skeptical of Western efforts to defend the international order against Russian excesses.\n\nRohan Mukherjee is an assistant professor of international relations at the London School of Economics and Political Science.

The match was played at Girona in Spain.\n\nIt was the first match of the exposure tour for the Indian girls ahead of the age-group showpiece, which India is hosting in October-November. Sudha Tirkey (62′) scored the only goal for India after Sweden U-17 girls took a comfortable 3-0 lead through Ida Gramfors (44′) Sara Frigren (52′) and Selma Astrom (54′). India, however, looked promising at the start as they competed on equal terms in an intense midfield battle that saw winger Anita Kumari get an early shot at the rival goal, which was saved.\n\nMinutes later, Nitu Linda tried her luck to take a shot from the edge of the Swedish penalty area, but was blocked. India earned a free kick in the 19th minute and Anita once again made an attempt at the rival goal, this time a header, but the Swedish custodian Elin Ekmark saved it with ease.\n\nA few minutes later Sweden striker Maja Jarvensivu tried a long ranger, which went over the bar. Both Anita and India goalkeeper Anjali enjoyed a good first half. The former made a few inroads around the half-hour mark, while the latter made a few worthy saves to keep her side in the game.",
    "Most pilots in India fall asleep while flying: Study": "In India, two-thirds of pilots have admitted to dozing off in the pilot's seat. According to a study by the Safety Matters Foundation that included 542 regional, local and international pilots, 66% of those polled admitted falling asleep while at the controls of the aircraft without waking up a fellow crew member. There is a chronic scarcity of competent pilots in India, where airlines require up to 1,500 new pilots annually. However, only 200 to 300 of these new hires have the appropriate training.\n\nAlso Read: DGCA imposes ₹10 lakh fine on Vistara\n\nThe most common causes of falling asleep in the cockpit were overwork and having to fly back-to-back morning flights, which required getting up as early as 2am. One of the biggest causes of aeroplane accidents is fatigue. Between India and the UK, where 1.5 million British Indians reside, there are hundreds of flights per week. Around 54% of pilots reported having severe excessive daytime sleepiness, according to their responses, while 41% reported having moderate excessive daytime sleepiness.\n\nAt least one-third of those polled admitted to having a near-accident experience while flying, which they attributed to being too fatigued. Pilot weariness accounts for 15-20% of human mistakes in fatal accidents. Aviation accidents do not happen every day. However, statistics reveal that 80% of the time, human error is to blame. Slower reaction times, diminished concentration and worse decision-making are all effects of fatigue.\n\nAlso Read: DGCA slaps 5 Kedarnath helicopter operators with 5-lakh fine, suspends officials\n\n48% of fatal accidents and onboard fatalities occur during the final approach and landing, according to a statistical review of commercial aeroplane accidents worldwide between 1959 and 2016. According to data from 2011 to 2015, the approach and landing phases of a flight accounted for over 65% of all accidents that were reported, with unstabilised approaches being a contributing factor in 14% of these incidents. Additionally, unstabilised approaches were at blame for 31% of runway excursions.",
    "Patrolling points do not define the Indian claim in East Ladakh LAC": "When External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar was asked about the PLA troop withdrawal from patrolling point 15 in Kugrang River on September 13, he correctly and tersely replied that it was “one problem less” with the Chinese authoritarian regime post May 2020 belligerence on the 1,597 km East Ladakh LAC.\n\nOn May 17-18, 2020, the aggressive PLA under control of Chinese ruler Xi Jinping transgressed in the areas of Kugrang river, Gogra, and north banks of Pangong Tso and junked all the peace and tranquillity agreements of the past. The Indian Army bound by the 1993-1996 border agreements and subsequent Confidence Building Measures (CBMs) did not open fire as it would have led to vertical escalation like it did when brave Colonel Santosh Babu and his men taught a lesson to the Chinese at Galwan on patrolling point 14 on June 15, 2020.\n\nSince the May 2020 transgressions, the Chinese have made new permanent structures all along the LAC, which is in violation of the past bilateral agreements and CBMs. One must recall that in 1976, the Cabinet Committee on Security under then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had approved what was then called “Limits of Patrolling” as defined by the then Cabinet Secretary and the China Study Group (CSG) on large topographical sheets.\n\nIn East Ladakh, the then Congress government approved 65 patrolling points from Karakoram Pass to Chumar as the limits for the Indian Army to patrol and avoid confrontation with the PLA. These points are well within Indian claim line on the LAC and were defined so to maintain peace and tranquillity on the border with China, which had proved to be a superior military power in 1962 border war.\n\nWhile the Narendra Modi government and the national security planners are quite clear that patrolling points do not define the Indian LAC claim in East Ladakh, the Indian Army must also not take the easy way out and only defend the LAC till these patrolling limit point on the map.\n\nThe disengagement from patrolling point 15 does not in any way restore the April 2020 status quo ante on the Ladakh LAC as the PLA must dismantle fresh military structures that have come up along the line since the aggression.\n\nThe Chinese must respect the Indian claim line in Depsang Bulge and Demchok area and restore the Indian Army’s right to patrol point 10 to 13 in the strategic bulge area as well as Charding Nullah Junction in Demchok before bilateral ties are normalized with Beijing. Simply put, the India-China LAC in East Ladakh is not defined by the patrolling points but by the Indian claim line.\n\nJust as the Modi government showed the way by ordering its troops to take dominant positions on south Pangong Tso banks on August 29-31, 2020, and force PLA subsequently to disengage from north banks of the lake, the Indian Army must now be in the position of strength all along the 3488 km LAC as the adversary only understands the language of power not peace.\n\nFact is that the Indian Army has no options as the PLA will continue nibbling on the East Ladakh LAC till it has impose its 1959 line, as advocated by then Chinese Premier Chou or Zhou En-Lai, on the disputed border. China has made its intentions very clear on the disputed border, time has come from Indian Army to also do so.\n\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE ON",
    "While Xi Jinping consolidates his power, apprehension grows in India": "There’s a sense of foreboding in New Delhi as Xi Jinping prepares to secure a third five-year term as China’s president. It’s expected that Xi’s appointment will be confirmed by the 20th congress of the Chinese Communist Party, which begins in Beijing on 16 October.\n\nUnder Xi, China has, with relentless pugnacity, challenged India’s sovereignty by encroaching on its territorial waters and redrawing the Line of Actual Control, the 3,488-kilometre Himalayan frontier that divides the nuclear-armed neighbours.\n\nXi queered the pitch further by rebuffing India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who had been looking forward to a separate meeting with him at last week’s Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Uzbekistan. Xi pointedly did not acknowledge Modi even when the Indian leader walked up to him at the photoshoot of the organisation’s leadership.\n\nModi has hitherto been unable to raise with Xi the issue of Chinese troops on Indian territory since their violent cross-border clash with Indian soldiers on 5 May 2020. Chinese troops also slew 20 Indian soldiers in the area on 15 June 2020, the first deadly skirmish since 1967, when a border confrontation led to the deaths of 80 Indian and 400 Chinese soldiers. It is widely believed that a direct discussion would have helped defuse the tensions.\n\nThis has raised concern about an apparent communication gap between the two leaders. Modi has previously claimed a close rapport with Xi, built up over his nine visits to China, five as prime minister and four previously as chief minister of Gujarat state. He also hosted the Chinese president in India three times between 2014 and 2019.\n\nMoreover, even as corps commander-level talks on disengagement and de-escalation continue between the two countries, Modi has avoided identifying China as the aggressor, asserting instead, ‘No intruder is present inside India’s borders, nor is any post under anyone’s custody.’\n\nIndia has demonstrably been pushed onto the back foot as more than 50,000 People’s Liberation Army troops continue to occupy 1,000 square kilometres of the eastern sector of India’s border union territory of Ladakh.\n\nWhile an intransigent China has not heeded India’s call for reinstatement of all the captured territories, it consented to a localised disengagement by Indian and Chinese frontline troops being carried out last week from Patrolling Point 15 in Gogra-Hot Springs, as per the agreement reached at the 16th round of talks in July.\n\nA similar breakthrough had been reached once before, at the 9th round of talks in January 2021, which led to disengagement at the south and north banks of the Pangong Tso lake.\n\nWhile China yielded some ground, India appears bereft of any comprehensive strategy to deal with the situation. New Delhi’s anxiety about pursuing a negotiated conciliation has been prompted by the vast disparities between their forces. Military retaliation is not an option for India, as it strives to prevent the hostility spiralling into an all-out war it can ill-afford.\n\nThough India has affirmed that only complete disengagement can lead to de-escalation of hostilities, it hailed the limited withdrawals as major concessions it extracted from Beijing. However, it has ceded territory to China by agreeing to the pullbacks from areas well within its borders and to the creation of ‘buffer zones’ inside its territory.\n\nIt also remains to be seen how long this disengagement will hold. PLA troops recrossed the LAC following the 2021 disengagement to reoccupy positions on the Kailash Range that they had vacated, and others moved in to points near the Pangong Tso and Galwan river.\n\nA menacing China has opened additional fronts along India’s border states of Arunachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Sikkim. Beijing has all along claimed the 83,743square kilometre Arunachal as part of southern Tibet. In 2018 its state-run English-language daily Global Times asserted: ‘Although China recognised India’s annexation of [7,096 square kilometres] Sikkim in 2003, it can readjust its stance on the matter.’\n\nThe PLA has also brought in medium-lift helicopters, towed artillery, light tanks, infantry combat vehicles, rocket launchers and drones with thermal imaging, and created extensive support infrastructure with fortifications and encampments, all within striking distance of Indian deployments. It has also laid fibre-optic cables to secure lines of communication between forward troops and bases in the rear.\n\nChina’s push against India doesn’t appear merely tactical, but has a strategic intent with long-term objectives. These moves are not directed by exuberant commanders on the ground, but by the topmost leadership, the Central Military Commission, chaired by Xi.\n\nDespite three previous border agreements, Beijing disputes most of its territorial demarcations with India. In 2017, it had a 73-day standoff with India at the India–China–Bhutan tri-junction of Doklam, the most critical in decades.\n\nIndia has reason to fear a progressive deterioration in its security environment, with the CCP congress expected to cement Xi’s place as the country’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong. Xi made this possible when in 2018 he rescinded the two-term limit for the presidency. He has served as CCP general secretary and chair of the Central Military Commission since 2012 and has been president since 2013.\n\nRecently in New Delhi, Indian foreign minister S. Jaishankar observed: ‘It is said that the prerequisite for an Asian Century is an India and China coming together.’\n\nConversely, he said, the inability of these nations to work together will undermine that goal.",

    "Indian government accused of ceding land in Himalayas to China": "Indian people living near the country’s disputed Himalayan border with China have accused their government of giving away swathes of land after both sides agreed to withdraw troops from some contested areas and create buffer zones.\n\nEarlier this month, Indian and Chinese troops, who have been locked in a tense border dispute since June 2020, began to draw back from the contested area of Gogra-Hot Springs after an agreement was reached to disengage.\n\nThe Indian government said the agreement restored the territory on both sides of the contested border, known as the line of actual control, to the “pre-standoff period”. In the newly created buffer zones, neither side will be allowed to patrol their troops.\n\nNevertheless, local Indian residents, elected representatives of the region and former Indian military officers who have served along the disputed border in Ladakh are claiming that the new “buffer zones” have been established in areas previously under Indian control.\n\nMeanwhile, they allege Chinese troop positions remain either in contested areas or much inside the Indian territory.\n\n“Our army is vacating areas which were not disputed at all, while Chinese troops are stationed in the areas traditionally patrolled by India,” said Konchok Stanzin, an elected councillor from the region.\n\nStanzin claimed that India had already given up territory to China during a 2021 agreement to withdraw from contested areas around Ladakh’s Lake Pangong. “We raised similar concerns in earlier disengagement, like in the Pangong Tso area where our army again lost a huge area,” he said.\n\nMany people in the local area spoke of concerns not only for their security but the consequences the loss of land to Chinese troops was having on their livelihoods. “We are losing massive pastures, which we would use as grazing land,” said Stanzin, who belongs, like most of the people in the area, to the tribal Changpa cattle herders community. Their main sources of living have been cashmere wool-producing Changra goats.\n\n“Earlier, our concern was about Chinese incursions only but now the situation is more worrying as our government is giving up our land happily,” he said. “If India’s approach remains the same, we are going to lose more land.”\n\nIndia’s main opposition leader, Rahul Gandhi, has accused Narendra Modi’s government of “giving 1,000 sq km [390 sq miles] of territory to China without a fight”.\n\nThe recent withdrawal consensus was reached last week, during the 16th round of bilateral talks between leading Indian and Chinese military commanders. The two sides claimed to have agreed to disengage from respective sides in the area of Gogra-Hot Springs in a move “conducive to the peace and tranquillity in the border areas”.\n\nTashi Chhepal, a retired Indian army captain who served in Gogra-Hot Springs area around 1997, said that the areas now declared “buffer zones”, where neither Indian or Chinese troops will be positioned, had previously been patrolled by Indian troops.\n\n“We would patrol these areas where Chinese posts are now located, leave aside the buffer zones, which are clearly in our territory,” said Chhepal. “Ideally, the Chinese should also have moved behind their patrolling area, but that does not seem to be the case.”\n\nThe pullback of troops has been the second disengagement act since August 2021, when troops “ceased forward deployments” and dismantled infrastructure in another area in the region where tensions escalated in June 2020, when at least 20 Indian soldiers and four Chinese soldiers died during the deadliest clashes between the two nuclear powers in 50 years.\n\nAfter the violent altercation, in which soldiers fought with sticks and rocks in hand-to-hand combat, the two countries stationed hundreds of thousands of soldiers backed by artillery, tanks and fighter jets along the disputed border, militarising the region like never before.\n\nAfter the 2020 clash, tensions soared to extraordinary levels, with deployment of 200,000 troops on both sides of the frontier in this inhospitable high-altitude terrain, where the temperature drops as low as -40C (-40F) in winters. There was also unprecedented artillery and infrastructure buildup on both sides of the 2,100-mile border, including when China invaded India in 1962.\n\nAs a result, relations between India and China have remained icy. On Friday, Modi and President Xi Jinping of China were present at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit, the first time they had met since the clashes, but no handshakes or meetings were held between the two leaders.\n\nIndia’s military leaders called the disengagement a positive step that decreased the chances of a physical confrontation between the rival troops, who have been positioned almost nose-to-nose at certain points. In the area recently declared a buffer zone, China was reported to have built a temporary army base that has since been taken down.\n\n“The idea of buffer zones is to disengage so that troops are not face to face with each other and problems do not occur,” said Deepender Singh Hooda, the Indian army’s former head of northern command, which also includes the Ladakh region. “For example, in some areas tanks were within 100 metres of each other.”\n\nThe negotiations appear to be part of efforts by the Modi government to defuse the tensions along the border in order to portray the idea that India has been successful in dealing with an increasingly hostile China.\n\nNevertheless, Hooda was among those who said India had still been unable to get China to withdraw from the most strategically important border regions, including the Depsang and Demchok areas of Ladakh “where the Chinese are preventing Indian troops from patrolling a very large number of places”.\n\nThe area, home to a huge buildup of Chinese troops, is tactically important to India because of its proximity to India’s Daulat Beg Oldi military airbase and Shiachen glacier, the world’s highest battlefield, where India’s nemesis, Pakistan, has a strategic presence.\n\n“That is the area where the biggest problem is,” said Hooda.",
    "Turkey Is No Friend Of India; Modi Must Decipher Erdogan’s ‘Dangerous Ambitions’ That Threaten India & Beyond": "Opinion Article By Padma Shri KN Pandita\n\nSince Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan began to believe that he had a divine mission of reviving the lost grandeur of the Ottoman Empire, he concluded that a road to achieving that ambition lay through the labyrinth of Islamic revivalism.\n\nIn his college days, he was influenced by the Islamic Brotherhood Movement. His pro-Islamist reach is also because of the repeated refusal of the European Union to admit Turkey as a regular member. Deep inside, his inclination towards Islamism springs more from vengeance and much less from conviction in all Islam claims.\n\n“The mask of pro-Europeanism started to erase after continuous attempts by Turkey to be a part of the EU failed. After the 2011 Arab Spring, Erdogan asserted his support for Islamist political forces in the West Asia and North Africa (WANA) region like Mohammad Morsi in Egypt and the ‘Dawn Coalition’ in Libya,” wrote Tahiroglu in Ankara’s Failure.\n\nFirstly, Erdogan supported the Muslim Brotherhood-led Morsi government so much so that when Morsi was deposed in 2013 by al-Sisi in a military coup, and the latter became the president, Erdogan refused to recognize Sisi as a legitimate ruler of Egypt.\n\nSecondly, when the crackdown on Muslim Brotherhood leadership began under Sisi, many of its leaders and sympathizers relocated to Turkey. Thirdly, Erdogan’s support of the Muslim Brotherhood has been one of the main issues of contention between Turkey and its relations with the Arabs.\n\nThe UAE, Jordan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia are also on opposing sides of Turkey in Libya. The Arab monarchies are supporting the General Khalifa Haftar-led Libyan National Army.\n\nErdogan, who has regional ambitions in the Eastern Mediterranean, firmly supports the Government of National Accord, which has close relations with the Islamists and the Muslim Brotherhood. Turkey’s relations with Saudi Arabia have been badly affected after the killing of pro-US Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nHowever, Qatar and Turkey share ideological convergence in supporting the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamist groups like Hamas. Qatar also opposed Morsi’s overthrow, like Turkey. This explains the basis of their friendly relationship.\n\nWhile addressing the Sixth Religious Council meeting of the Presidency of Religious Affairs (DİB) in Ankara in November 2019, Erdogan charged that Muslim countries “look for solutions in the Western capitals for their problems, instead of reaching out to their Muslim brothers and sisters for help.” He contemplates new leadership of the ummah (an Arabic word meaning “community”) and discards the existing one.\n\nErdogan has been trying to gather international muscle around the idea of reviving the Muslim ummah, which other Islamic states like Pakistan and Malaysia have actively supported.\n\nErdogan praised the then Pakistan PM Imran Khan for raising the voice for Muslim ummah and the issue of Kashmir at a reception hosted for the participants of the Third Speakers Conference in Istanbul in October 2019.\n\nAt the UN General Assembly in 2019, Erdogan raked up Kashmir and criticized the international community for not paying attention to the issue.\n\nThis speech came just a month after the Indian government revoked Jammu and Kashmir’s special status (Article 370) in August 2019. He also highlighted the intervention issues in Yemen and Qatar and the Israeli settlements in the West Bank.\n\nTurkey, Pakistan, Malaysia, Iran, and Qatar also tried to create an alternative to the Saudi-dominated Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) by holding an Islamic summit in Kuala Lumpur in 2019.\n\nThis angered Riyadh, which pressured Pakistan to opt out of the summit. Erdogan, Mahathir Mohammad, Hassan Rouhani, and Qatar’s Hamad al-Thani participated in the conference.\n\nThe group creates an impression that most of the Arab peninsula monarchs have abandoned the cause of ummah, especially Palestine and Kashmir. Thus Erdogan tries to wear the crown of the leadership of the ummah.\n\nEven as he continues to work towards reviving the old Ottoman glory and ‘Ittihad-I Islam’ (‘Unity of Islam’), Erdogan will have to choose between a pragmatic vis-à-vis an Islamist foreign policy.\n\nIf the Turkish economy returns to high growth rates, Erdogan’s domestic position will be strengthened, and he might still return to his pet Islamist adventures overseas.\n\nWhat Are His Achievements As The President Of Turkey?\n\n“Erdogan has used his unprecedented power to sweep away judges, media outlets, journalists, academics, military officers, and NGOs. According to one estimate, about 120,000 government employees were suspended, dismissed, or imprisoned in the wake of the coup attempt, primarily from the judiciary and education branches.\n\nOver 7,500 soldiers and officers, including over 100 with the rank of brigadier or above, and over 10,000 policemen were sacked, with countless others imprisoned. More than a dozen colleges and universities and 1,000 schools were closed.\n\nThe licenses of 24 radio and TV channels were revoked, and numerous journalists were arrested”, reported BESA Centre Perspectives Paper No. 1,124, March 27, 2019.\n\nSpeaking at the annual coordination meeting of the OIC held in New York recently, Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said, “As the second largest international organization, the OIC is our collective voice against injustice towards Muslims. I reaffirm our strong solidarity with the Uyghur Turks, the Rohingya Muslims, our Kashmiri brothers, and all other Muslim communities facing injustice worldwide.”\n\nIf this is Turkey’s conviction, why did Erdogan speak about only Kashmir in his recent address to the UN General Assembly and skip the Uyghur Turks? OIC is doing politics, not religion.\n\nWhat makes Erdogan hostile to India is not the alleged disregard for the rights of Indian Muslims. No, that is not true. The truth is that Erdogan is very uncomfortable with Indian secular democracy that treats all citizens at par in the eyes of the law. \\\n\nTo Erdogan and the fundamentalists, the Islamic ummah is special specie and has not to be equated with non-Muslims in terms of civic and other rights. Turkey’s policy towards the Cypriots is also hinged on the same line of thinking.\n\nSuccessive governments in Ankara have always sided with Pakistan on the issue of Kashmir. Jagdish N Singh explains Turkey’s interference in the Indian part of Kashmir in his article ‘Erdogan’s Dangerous Ambitions Threaten India and Beyond.’\n\nAs part of its strategy to attain Muslim leadership status, Ankara has also been reaching out to Indian Muslims. Reliable reports indicate that in the recent past, the Erdogan regime has invited several Indian Islamist leaders, including Zakir Naik, to spread Erdogan’s influence across India.\n\nTurkish cleric Serdar Demirel visited Kolkata in 2016 to participate in a protest march organized by Muslims opposed to the Indian government’s bid to apply a Uniform Civil Code throughout the country. Turkey has also funded Indian NGOs to reach out to Muslim students and influence madrasahs and mosques.\n\nAnkara has given special facilities to Kashmiri Muslim students for admission to professional institutes in Ankara. The daughter of the late Ali Shah Geelani is running a website from Ankara which propagates vicious anti-India and anti-Hindu broadcasts.\n\nMost Kashmiri students who have joined educational institutions in Ankara are taken over by the ISI agents and given good brainwashing.\n\nJagadish N Singh concludes his write-up in these words: “The strategy seems to be working. There are indeed Muslims in India who see Erdogan as a leader of the Muslim world, and they celebrated his victory in the presidential elections of June 2018 in a big way.\n\nKashmiri separatist leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq was among the first to offer congratulations. In a speech to an Islamist group run by Erdogan’s son Bilal in 2017, Naik described the Turkish president as “one of the few Muslim leaders who have the guts to support Islam openly.” He said: “O Muslim world, wake up…May Erdogan be the next ruler of the Muslim world.”\n\nAfter the coup attempt in Turkey, Indian Islamic cleric Maulana Salman Hussaini Nadvi endorsed Erdogan, and the Shahi Imam of Delhi Sayyid Ahmed Bukhari met the Turkish ambassador to India and expressed his support. Delegations from Jamaat-e-Islami Hind, Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, the Chishty Foundation, and the India Islamic Cultural Centre (IICC) met the envoy.\n\nThis narrative about Erdogan’s Islamist credentials should help New Delhi understand how it has to deal with the interference of a radical nature. It must not allow a Turkish Islamist like Demirel to join a domestic protest in India.\n\nThis amounts to interfering with India’s internal matters. New Delhi must not tolerate Ankara’s hobnobbing with an Indian Islamist preacher like Zakir Naik, who is alleged to have inspired a terrorist attack on a cafe in Dhaka in 2016 and has been evading an arrest warrant in India. Doing so is tantamount to encouraging terror against India.\n\nPrime Minister Modi and President Erdogan have met on the sidelines of the Samarkand SCO meet. What transpired between the two is not known.\n\nObservers, commenting on Erdogan’s address to the UN General Assembly just two days after his meeting with Modi in Samarkand, have said that Erdogan toned down his Kashmir tantrum and has now referred to bilateral talks between India and Pakistan on the Kashmir issue.\n\nOne wonders whether Modi raised the problems of the Greece-Turkey dispute, Turkey’s use of brute force against Kurd dissidents, and Turkey’s silence on the atrocities perpetrated on the Uighurs of Xinxiang.\n\nErdogan is living in a glass house, throwing stones at others. He may or may not become the topmost leader of the Islamic ummah; that is no worry for the global society.\n\nThe concern is that he is trying to destabilize the secular-democratic dispensation of the world’s largest democracy which also has the second largest Muslim community as part of its society. This cannot be allowed.",

Canada has 17 parliamentarians and three cabinet ministers of Indian origin, including defence minister Anita Anand, the Hindustan Times newspaper said.\n\nIndia has repeatedly raised the issue of Canada allowing the Khalistani separatist groups to operate on its land.\n\nNew Delhi believes the Trudeau government has not done enough to address its concerns about the activities of pro-Khalistan elements in Canada, the Hindustan Times said.\n\nIndia’s foreign ministry spokesman Arindam Bagchi on Thursday called the referendum in Canada a “farcical exercise held by extremist and radical elements,” according to a report by the NDTV network.\n\nBagchi said it was “deeply objectionable” that such an exercise was allowed in a friendly country.\n\nIn response, the Canadian government said it respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of India and will not recognise the so-called referendum, according to Indian media reports.",

More than USD 300 billion of benefits have been distributed digitally, 400 million people get food regularly,” he said.\n\n\"India today envisions itself as a developed country by 2047, at the 100 years of our independence. We dream of digitising our most remote villages and landing on the moon,\" he said and smiled saying \"perhaps digitising\" the moon as well.\n\nIndia stands committed to strengthen its partnership with United Nations to ensure a brighter future for the planet, he said. “We have full faith in the principles of UN and its charter. The world in our view is one family today,” Jasihankar said.\n\n“The conflict in Ukraine has aggravated food and energy inflation to make it one of the biggest challenges of our times. India has responded by supplying food grains including as grant assistance in recent years to Afghanistan, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Yemen and several other countries,” he said.\n\nThe event was attended by dignitaries from the UN, including president of the 77th session of UN General Assembly Csaba Korosi, UN deputy secretary-general Amina Mohammed, Maldives foreign minister Abdulla Shahid and UNDP administrator Achim Steiner.\n\nJaishankar said India believes that development is a public good and open sourcing is the best way forward.\n\n(With inputs from ANI, PTI)\n\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE ON",
    "Great opportunity lies in the Australia-India relationship": "Innovation and research is the foundation of our future with India for quality education, graduates and discovery.\n\nVicki Thomson\n\nSep 4, 2022 – 12.44pm\n\nLast week’s Jobs and Skills Summit was an exemplar of what can be achieved when we come together with a solutions-based mindset to tackle the genuinely big issues that create barriers to increased productivity and potentially pull the handbrake on our future prosperity. But one big item missing from the agenda was the role of research in boosting our economic complexity and, in turn, lifting productivity.\n\nThis week I will be in India alongside senior business and industry leaders as part of the Australia-India Leadership Dialogue. We will be bringing that same solutions-based mindset to our discussions. For Group of Eight universities, underpinning our Australia-India partnership is both our research and education.\n\nIndia has a huge population of young people to educate. Australia has large, world-class universities with comprehensive programs. What we don’t have – as attested to by the likes of Atlassian and the Business Council of Australia at the jobs summit – is a large enough quality workforce pipeline across key industries, particularly in research.\n\nPutting it bluntly, we have a research skills crisis.\n\nAustralia and India have had strong research and education relationships for decades. We face similar environmental and sustainability challenges. Australia is also now home to a significant and growing Indian diaspora.\n\nHerein lies the opportunity. There is now a sense of urgency from both sides to ramp up these partnerships and a strong sense that they must be underpinned by quality.\n\nThe fact is, despite having seven Go8 members ranked in the top 100 universities in the world, Australia is not seen as a quality education and research destination for prospective Indian students.\n\nCentre of world affairs\n\nInternational competition in the research and higher education sector is fierce and Australia has to step up. However, the Go8 will never trade quality for quantity even while we have the capacity and willingness to do so much more.\n\nThis is not just a student recruitment exercise. It will have a focus on research partnerships with both Indian universities and industries.\n\nOf course, our two nations share more than our values, interests and objectives.\n\nWe also share the Indo-Pacific region, and so we share all the geopolitical challenges visible in the region as it pivots to the centre of world affairs or, at least, the same world order with a range of different emphases.\n\nHere, too, lie significant opportunities to underpin our education and research partnership in areas such as AI and cybersecurity, areas in which India excels and we lack capacity.\n\nUniversities are generators of research that fuels rapidly evolving fields, and we contribute to the workforce pipeline through graduates.\n\nVisas are clearly part of this solution and the federal government has acknowledged the need to use migration as a lever to address Australia’s present skills shortfalls. But there are additional options we should also be pursuing.\n\nWhat to do about our poor innovation record\n\nThe recently signed Australia-UK Free Trade Agreement includes the first-ever dedicated innovation chapter. It recognises the critical importance of innovation and the need to facilitate the mobility of skilled individuals across borders.\n\nThe Australia-India Economic Co-operation and Trade Agreement should replicate this as a driver of increased productivity and economic growth.\n\nInnovation is an umbrella term for future economic success. It is why federal Trade Minister Don Farrell is heading to India in a few weeks to further develop a formal agreement between the two countries.\n\nThis week’s leadership dialogue is an important forerunner to this negotiation.\n\nWe have a moment in time to grasp these opportunities with India. Only two weeks ago, we hosted a visit by India’s education minister, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan. If innovation and research can deliver as it should, it is the foundation of our future with India for quality education, graduates and researchers.\n\nVicki Thomson is chief executive of the Group of Eight.",
    "Sikh refugees evacuated from Afghanistan to India recall Taliban horror": "An evacuation flight carrying people from the Sikh minority in Afghanistan -- who are fleeing the Taliban rule -- arrived in India Sunday. Upon arrival, one of them expressed happiness for having fled the country, which plunged into a crisis after the Taliban returned to power last year, overthrowing the Ashraf Ghani-led government.\n\nTalking to news agency ANI, Baljeet Singh spoke of the conditions in the country, and said he had been imprisoned by the Taliban for four months. \"The condition is not very well in Afghanistan. I was imprisoned for four months. The Taliban have cheated us, they cut our hair in prison. I am thankful and happy to return to India,\" he said.\n\nFifty-five Afghan Sikhs arrived in a special flight which landed at Delhi airport Sunday, as a part of the government's efforts to evacuate the distressed minorities in the Taliban-led nation. The flight was organised by the Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandak Committee, Amritsar, in coordination with the Indian World Forum and the Centre to evacuate these Afghan minorities, said ANI.\n\nAnother refugee thanked the government for providing urgent e-visas and safely evacuating them.\n\n\"We would like to thank the Indian government to give us urgent visas and help us to reach India. Many of us still have families left behind as around 30-35 people are left stranded in Afghanistan,\" Sukhbeer Singh Khalsa said.\n\nOn July 14, a total of 21 Afghan Sikhs, including an infant, were evacuated from Kabul to New Delhi on Kam Air, the largest private Afghan airline.\n\nAbout 700 Hindus and Sikhs were reported to be in Afghanistan in 2020, but a large number of them left the country following the Taliban's takeover on August 15, 2021.\n\nThere has been a reported rise in a series of attacks on the Sikhs since the Taliban took over Afghanistan.\n\nOn June 18, the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) attacked Karte Parwan Gurdwara in Kabul which claimed the lives of about 50 people. In October, last year 15 to 20 terrorists entered a Gurdwara in the Kart-e-Parwan District of Kabul and tied up the guards.\n\n(With ANI inputs)\n\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE ON\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR HT News Desk Follow the latest breaking news and developments from India and around the world with Hindustan Times' newsdesk.

    "Russia’s allies China and India call for negotiations to end Ukraine war": "China and India have called for a negotiated end to the Ukraine war, stopping short of robust support for traditional ally Russia.\n\nAfter a week of pressure at the United Nations general assembly, Russia’s foreign minister took the general assembly rostrum to deliver a fiery rebuke to western nations for what he termed a “grotesque” campaign against Russians.\n\nBut no major nation has rallied behind Russia, including China, which just days before the February invasion of Ukraine had vowed an “unbreakable” bond with President Vladimir Putin.\n\nChina’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, called on Russia and Ukraine to “keep the crisis from spilling over” and from affecting developing countries.\n\nAny annexed territory will have Russia's ‘full protection’, says Sergei Lavrov – video\n\n“China supports all efforts conducive to the peaceful resolution of the Ukraine crisis. The pressing priority is to facilitate talks for peace,” Wang said on Saturday.\n\n“The fundamental solution is to address the legitimate security concerns of all parties and build a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture.”\n\nDuring his visit to the United Nations, Wang met Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, in their first talks since the war began.\n\nEarlier this month Putin acknowledged Chinese “concerns” about Ukraine during a meeting with his counterpart, Xi Jinping.\n\nUS officials have been heartened by what they see as China’s lack of concrete backing for the war and said that Beijing has declined requests to send military equipment, forcing Russia to rely on North Korea and Iran as its own supplies dwindle.\n\nChina’s reaction to Russia is being closely watched for clues on its approach to Taiwan, a self-governing democracy that Beijing claims as its territory.\n\nWang held firm that China would take “forceful steps” against any interference, insisting that efforts to prevent “reunification” with Taiwan would be “crushed by the wheels of history”.\n\nIndia, unlike China, has a warm relationship with the United States but it has historical ties with Russia, its traditional defence supplier.\n\n“As the Ukraine conflict continues to rage, we are often asked whose side we are on,” said India’s foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.\n\n“Our answer, each time, is straight and honest – India is on the side of peace and will remain firmly there,” he said.\n\n“We are on the side that calls for dialogue and diplomacy as the only way out.”\n\nRussia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, at a news conference declined to answer whether there has been any pressure from China. In his speech, he sought to cast blame squarely on the west.\n\n“The official Russophobia in the west is unprecedented. Now the scope is grotesque,” Lavrov told the general assembly.\n\n“They are not shying away from declaring the intent to inflict not only military defeat on our country but also to destroy and fracture Russia.”\n\nThe United States, he said, since the end of the cold war has acted as if it is “an envoy of God on Earth, with the sacred right to act with impunity wherever and whenever they want”, Lavrov said.\n\nHe also blasted the European Union as an “authoritarian, harsh, dictatorial entity” and said the bloc’s leadership forced one member state’s leader – the Cypriot president, Nicos Anastasiades – to cancel a planned meeting with him.\n\nLavrov criticised the west for not engaging with Russia, saying, “we have never stepped away from maintaining contact”.\n\nWestern powers are looking at further sanctions after Putin called up reservists and made a veiled threat to use nuclear weapons, and have refused to recognise results of referendums on Russian annexation being held in occupied territories.\n\nThey have welcomed Lavrov’s isolation, noting how he only showed up at a security council session on Thursday to deliver remarks and not to listen to others.\n\nRussia enjoyed one rare voice of support on Saturday at the general assembly. Mali’s interim prime minister, Col Abdoulaye Maïga, appointed by coup leaders, hailed the “exemplary and fruitful cooperation” with Moscow.\n\nThe junta has welcomed Russia’s Wagner Group security firm, despite western allegations of rights abuses, as France pulled out troops who had been struggling to contain a jihadist insurgency.",
    "VPN Providers Flee India as a New Data Law Takes Hold": "Ahead of the deadline to comply with the Indian government’s new data-collection rules, VPN companies from across the globe have pulled their servers out of the country in a bid to protect their users’ privacy.\n\nStarting today, the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team, or CERT—a body appointed by the Indian government to deal with cybersecurity and threats—will require VPN operators to collect and maintain customer information including names, email addresses, and IP addresses for at least five years, even after they have canceled their subscription or account.\n\nIn April, CERT said it needed to implement these rules because “the requisite information is not found available” with the security provider during investigations into cybersecurity threats, thereby thwarting inquiries. The new rules, CERT claims, will “strengthen cyber security in India” and are “in the interest of sovereignty or integrity of India.”\n\nVPN companies and privacy experts believe this move impacts user privacy and freedom of speech, and defeats the sole purpose of using VPNs, which encrypt users’ internet activity and mask their locations and identities.\n\n“As digital privacy and security advocates, we are concerned about the possible effect this regulation may have on not only our users but people’s data in general,” says NordVPN spokesperson Laura Tyrylyte. “From what it seems, the amount of stored private information will be drastically increased throughout hundreds or maybe thousands of different companies.” She adds that similar regulations have been “typically introduced by authoritarian governments in order to gain more control over their citizens.”\n\nLast year, India became the country with the highest rate of growth in the use of VPN services worldwide. During the first half of 2021, 348.7 million VPNs were installed, showing a 671 percent jump in growth when compared to the same period in 2020, according to a 2021 analysis by Atlas VPN. This massive growth can be attributed to continuous internet shutdowns, a rise in digital scams, and the need for Indians to protect themselves online.\n\n“VPNs by nature can be a privacy advancing tool and can be capable of protecting information security in multiple ways, being used by individuals and companies to secure confidential information,” says Tejasi Panjiar, associate policy counsel at the Internet Freedom Foundation. “They also help secure digital rights under the constitution, especially for journalists and whistleblowers, because the nature of information that’s transferred over VPNs is primarily encrypted, which allows them not only to secure confidential information but also to safeguard their own identity, protecting them from surveillance and censorship.”\n\nThe government defended its rules, saying it will not violate user privacy as information would be sought only on a case-by-case basis. This claim ignores the Indian government’s track record of surveilling critics, politicians, and activists. In August, an official investigation into whether Indians were spied on by the government using Israeli spyware Pegasus revealed that at least five phones of victims contained malware, but refused to disclose the report. Instead, the country’s top court recommended that existing surveillance laws incorporate the right to privacy and introduce mechanisms for citizens to raise complaints against illegal surveillance.",
    "‘There hasn’t been closure’: India mourns Queen but awaits apology": "Over the course of her seven-decade reign, Queen Elizabeth II made three visits to India, a country she would herald for its “richness and diversity”. But it was her third and final trip in 1997 that is often considered the most significant.\n\nIndia was celebrating 50 years of independence and on the Queen’s itinerary was a visit to Jallianwala Bagh, the site in the city of Amritsar where in 1919 a British general ordered thousands of peaceful protesters to be shot, a massacre that was one of the bloodiest episodes of British colonial rule over India. The hope among many was that the Queen’s visit would finally bring about a long-awaited apology for colonial atrocities. But in the end, the apology never came.\n\n“It is no secret that there have been some difficult episodes in our past,” said the Queen in her address the night before her visit. “Jallianwala Bagh, which I shall visit tomorrow, is a distressing example. But history cannot be rewritten, however much we might sometimes wish otherwise.”\n\nWhen Queen Elizabeth was born in 1926, her grandfather was still the Emperor of India, which was under British rule for 200 years, but by the time she ascended to the throne in 1952, India had been independent for five years. At her wedding to Philip Mountbatten in 1947, the Queen was given a handkerchief by India’s best known freedom campaigner, Mahatma Gandhi, and it was said to remain one of her most treasured possessions.\n\nThe somewhat muted response to the Queen’s death in India reflects her complex position in a nation where the British monarchy is still seen as a lasting symbol of colonial rule that pillaged its lands for 200 years. India’s last viceroy before independence was the Queen’s distant cousin Lord Louis Mountbatten – also Prince Philip’s uncle – who oversaw the bloody partitioning of the country into the separate nations of India and Pakistan.\n\nIndia remains the largest country in the Commonwealth, which is largely made up of former British territories and is still formally headed by the British monarch. After news of the Queen’s death broke, a national day of mourning was declared and all flags were lowered to half-mast.\n\nThe Indian national flag flies at half-mast on the ramparts of Red Fort in Delhi. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\n“Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will be remembered as a stalwart of our times,” tweeted India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi. “She provided inspiring leadership to her nation and people. She personified dignity and decency in public life. Pained by her demise.”\n\nBut though multiple Bollywood stars sent effusive condolences over the Queen’s death on social media, there was otherwise little public outpouring of grief.\n\nJyoti Atwal, a professor of history at Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi, said that in India, the institution of the monarchy was still lambasted as a symbol of British rule. Hours before the death of the Queen was announced, Modi oversaw the renaming of Rajpath, a central avenue in Delhi that during the colonial period had been named in honour of King George V, Queen Elizabeth’s grandfather. Modi said Rajpath was a “symbol of slavery”, which would now be erased.\n\nHowever, Atwal said that on a personal level, the Queen’s visits to India, particularly her first in 1961, had earned her much affection and admiration – many people can still recall watching her riding through the streets of Delhi in her royal coach buggy.\n\n“The Queen represented the oppression of British rule and colonialism, but she was also viewed separately as a person, not just as a monarch, and people in India were very charmed by her visits, by that buggy culture,” said Atwal. “My mother still remembers the Queen’s visit in 1961; she was a child sitting in the front row when the Queen was travelling in the buggy. So it captured the public imagination even though it was clearly a remnant of the British Raj.”\n\nNonetheless, Atwal said, as the furore around the Queen’s visit to Jallianwala Bagh had demonstrated, in India there was a lasting expectation that the British monarchy should apologise for the injustices of colonial rule, which some view as an essential part of the process of decolonisation.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So now that Charles is King, people in India will be expecting the apology from him.”\n\nSince the the Queen’s death, there have also been calls for the return of the Koh-I-Noor diamond, one of the largest cut diamonds in the world, which sits in the crown of the Queen Mother and is on display at the Tower of London. The diamond, which was mined in India, has been the source of a decades-long dispute between India and the UK, with India saying it was taken illegally.\n\nOver the weekend, the Indian MP and author Shashi Tharoor called its display in London a “powerful reminder of the injustices perpetrated by the former imperial power”. It is thought the crown bearing the Koh-i-Noor diamond will now be worn by King Charles’s wife, Camilla, the Queen Consort.\n\n“Until it is returned at least as a symbolic gesture of expiation it will remain evidence of the loot, plunder and misappropriation that colonialism was really all about,” said Tharoor.\n\nNonetheless, in India’s financial hub of Mumbai, one community made a heartfelt tribute to the Queen. Years ago, the city’s famed dabbawalas, who deliver hot food from homes to workplaces in tiffin boxes, caught the attention of the royal family, and two dabbawalas were invited to the wedding of Prince Charles and Camilla in 2005, where they breakfasted twice with the Queen.\n\n“We share the grief of the family of King Charles,” said the Mumbai Dabbawala Association in a statement. “We are very sad to hear about the death of Queen Elizabeth II and all dabbawalas pray that her soul rests in peace.”"
