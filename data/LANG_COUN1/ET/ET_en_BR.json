    "Brazil’s agribusiness sector provides fertile ground for Bolsonaro": "Brazil presidential election\n\nThe agricultural sector has one of the most powerful political lobbies in Brazil, and President Jair Bolsonaro enjoys strong support in the country’s main agricultural states. Many farmers have rallied behind Bolsonaro during his tenure, but will their support be enough to secure him a second term?\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nA 4x4 lurches along a dirt track leading to a farm, leaving a cloud of red dust in its wake. The season has been drier than usual in Goias, a state in central Brazil. A sticker supporting Bolsonaro on the car’s rear window is caked in red earth, barely visible. “We had to call the fire brigade last week because several hectares caught fire over there,” says Danilo Melo, 59, pointing towards a seemingly endless expanse of land.\n\nMelo has been working for almost 40 years on the 850 hectares of soy and corn fields that he inherited from his parents. They emigrated inland “to conquer the region of Brasilia before the capital was even born”, he says. He is a member of the powerful Agriculture and Livestock Confederation (CNA) lobby and a fierce defender of President Bolsonaro as he seeks re-election.\n\n“Thanks to Bolsonaro, we don’t pay export taxes. I can sell my soy without any issues; he’s reduced the paperwork, the bureaucracy,” Melo says, sipping water in the cool shade in a kitchen belonging to one of his farmhands. Melo predicts catastrophe should Bolsonaro’s left-wing rival, former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (known as “Lula”), win the October 2 presidential election.\n\n“It will be the beginning of the end. He wants to prioritise growing crops for Brazil and limit exports, but that will kill our business because we will have to sell our soy more cheaply.”\n\nFarmers and supporters of Bolsonaro in Brazil's Mato Grosso state. © Louise Raulais\n\n‘Agribusiness is with Bolso’\n\nThe president is seen as a hero in many of Brazil’s agricultural states for having legalised more than 400,000 property titles throughout his term – a record – and for having transferred responsibility for delineating Indigenous land (a controversial issue for the agricultural sector) to the agriculture ministry. Idolised by small and large-scale landowners alike, his support is evident in the pro-Bolsonaro billboards erected at the entrance to many villages.\n\nMelo says Bolsonaro has overwhelming support among farmers. “We must be around 350 farmers in the two unions of which I’m a member. Just one guy won’t vote for him,” he says.\n\nThe Bolsonaro camp says the president’s strong support among farmers is not reflected in polls predicting a Lula victory, including those by Datafolha, a respected pollster that is denounced by the president’s supporters. During the celebrations of Brazil’s independence bicentennial on September 7, thousands in Rio de Janeiro and Brasilia sported T-shirts emblazoned with the slogan, “Agribusiness is with Bolso.”\n\nThis rural popularity may seem far removed from the electoral weight of urban centres, but it will add up on election day. In Brasilia, the political capital, and Sao Paulo, the country’s economic motor, the CNA sets the tone. During an event attended by Bolsonaro and his former agricultural minister Tereza Cristina last month, the lobby’s president said that Brazil has “no place for a candidate who faces judicial procedures and is an ex-convict”, a reference to former president Lula, who spent 579 days in prison on corruption charges that were later annulled by the Supreme Court.\n\n‘Fascists and right-wingers’\n\nMelo is not so much worried about corruption as he is about land invasions by the MST, the landless workers’ movement supported by Lula. “It’s never happened to me but my neighbour was attacked,” he says. He adds: “Thank goodness Bolsonaro defends the right to possess firearms; we need them to protect ourselves on a farm as big as mine.”\n\nLula, the Workers’ Party candidate, may have undermined his appeal to farmers when he described a segment of the agribusiness sector as “fascists and right-wingers” in a TV interview in late August. Lula has historically been a defender of small-scale farmers – to whom he has promised special lines of credit – and is now looking to make inroads with big agribusiness voters despite their misgivings.\n\nBolsonaro’s negative image abroad weighs against him\n\nLula, indeed, scored a recent win with the unexpected endorsement of centrist lawmaker Neri Geller, the vice-president of the agricultural caucus in congress. Geller is running for a senate seat this year representing Mato Grosso, a state that is one of Brazil’s most important exporters of meat and soya. Geller, a politician farmer himself, has said he is impressed with Lula’s pick for running mate – the moderate Geraldo Alckmin (PSB) – and with the Workers’ Party’s attempts at dialogue.\n\n“The current government is getting bogged down in ideological fights with China, for example, our biggest trading partner, whereas Lula knows how to be a leader who reassures the markets,” Geller said in an interview last week with CartaCapital, a Brazilian weekly.\n\nSome members of the agricultural caucus also see Bolsonaro’s extremely negative image internationally as a Lula advantage. Lula is popular with the European community, for example, raising the possibility that he could succeed in securing an EU trade deal with the South American trade bloc Mercosur.\n\nThere is yet another argument in Lula’s favour: calm and stability are good for business. Some big names in the agricultural sector such as Blairo Maggi – nicknamed the “soy king” – do not like Bolsonaro’s belligerent tone or his anti-democratic comments.\n\nMelo, however, is convinced that agribusiness “will never accept Lula”. And regional polls say he may be right: across Brazil’s huge agricultural belt, which spans from the centre-west down to the south, Bolsonaro remains the favourite.\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe",
    "Why Brazilian football fans are ditching the yellow jersey": "Once an icon of unity and luck, the association of the shirt with Brazil’s far right has led football fans to give up on it.\n\nRio de Janeiro, Brazil – Higor Ramalho, an ardent football fan, plans to resume his regular trips to football stadiums as worries over the spread of the coronavirus ease, restrictions are lifted and the nation gets into the World Cup spirit.\n\nHowever, the famous yellow jersey associated with the Brazilian national team has been hanging in his closet since June 2018. The last time he wore it was on his birthday. He does not know when, and if, he will ever wear it again.\n\n“Wearing the yellow jersey was a moment of pride for me,” the 33-year-old told Al Jazeera.\n\n“It was a symbol of victory. I used to wear it not only while watching matches but also on regular days. Now, I have stopped wearing it for political reasons. The current president, along with his supporters, turned the yellow jersey into a political campaign and a symbol of their political party.\n\n“And as I don’t support their political ideas, I refuse to be mistaken as one of them.”\n\nThe yellow jersey, known as the “canarinho jersey”, has not always been the Brazil national team’s shirt.\n\nIt was designed in 1953, three years after the World Cup final heartbreak at the hands of Uruguay in the Maracana. At the time, the national team wore white.\n\nThe national football governing body, along with a newspaper, launched a competition to design a new uniform for the national side, the condition being the new kit should have the colours of the national flag as the current did not carry “the idea of Brazilian nationality”.\n\nMore than 300 entries were submitted. The winning submission was by Aldyr Garcia Schlee, a Brazilian who felt torn by the 1950 result given that he was born on the border with Uruguay.\n\nFast forward many years, including a record five football World Cup wins and two Copa America triumphs, the yellow jersey had become a symbol of optimism, luck and unity among football fans.\n\nThe number 10 worn by Pele during his mesmerising years on the pitch, Ronaldo’s number 9 when he became a World Cup winner and Romario’s number 11 during his dazzling World Cup 1994 run all became part of Brazil’s rich and successful history on the pitch.\n\nBut the shirt’s adoption in political campaigns, most recently by President Jair Bolsonaro and his right-wing supporters prior to his 2018 election win, forced a huge number of fans to give up on it.\n\nAnalysts say those same iconic moments of Brazilian football are being used off the pitch to promote ideas antithetical to the unity that made the national team, and the country, famous.\n\n“Football is something iconic for Brazil, it is what brings everybody together most of the time,” Isabela Guedes, 25, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“When they [right-wing supporters] take something so meaningful for the country and use it with political intentions, it is like they are stealing it from us. I don’t feel comfortable hanging a flag on my window during the World Cup because I will be mistaken for people with completely different political views.\n\n“They have taken the flag and yellow jersey and turned them into political symbols.”\n\nCo-opting the jersey did not start with Bolsanaro supporters. In 1970, the military dictatorship used the national flag and the team’s image, associating the essence of Brazil with the team, according to Carolina Fontenelle, a researcher at the Laboratory of Media and Sports Studies at UERJ.\n\nGeneral Medici, Brazil’s military leader at the time, also played a big role in the removal of the national team coach ahead of the 1970 Mexico World Cup.\n\nWith time, and these efforts, a strong connection was formed between Brazilians and their team’s jersey, she added.\n\n“Since then, the yellow jersey has been perceived as a symbol. People look at that jersey and wear it with pride because they feel part of a group,” Fontenelle told Al Jazeera.\n\nBefore that, during the 2013 riots protesting a rise in the cost of living, corruption and police brutality, the jersey took on another aspect.\n\n“People part of the riots were also wearing it. There was a high number of people on the streets protesting against many things, including the money spent on the World Cup 2014. In 2018, we had the far-right wearing the jersey,” Fontenelle said.\n\n“So those who don’t agree with it start to feel ashamed. The jersey gives a feeling that you belong to a group and this feeling is lost when it is being used by a political group that doesn’t defend the minorities.”\n\n“During the 2014 elections, the campaign of [centre-right candidate] Aecio Neves hijacked the colours of the Brazilian flag,” Fontenelle said.\n\n#GiveBackOurFlag\n\nJust over two years ago, a campaign, led by writer and filmmaker Joao Carlos Assumpcao, demanded the national football body abolish the famous yellow jersey and bring back the white and blue kit.\n\n“We’re in a ghastly situation with a horrendous government that has stolen our flag,” Assumpcao had said at the time.\n\nSeveral pro-democracy groups, including the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper, tried to dissociate the colour with the far-right campaign.\n\nIn 2020, following campaigns by Bolsonaro supporters on the Supreme Court and Congress, it urged its readers to wear yellow as part of the dissociation campaign.\n\n#DevolvamNossaBandeira (#GiveBackOurFlag) also got the backing of several political figures.\n\n“Football is for everyone, I don’t like it [the jersey] being used by people who promote racism, sexism and discrimination,” Ademir Takara, the librarian and historian at the Museum of Football in Sao Paulo, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“The shirt is the opposite of that. It represents unity and it’s not being used for that purpose. There’s an affectionate relationship between people and the shirt – the beautiful game attached to something it represented.\n\n“From 2013, it has become a political thing more than ever before. It’s being used by people with different ideas who wanted something to unify them and the shirt was the easiest and strongest thing they saw.”\n\nEarlier this month, thousands of Bolsonaro supporters flocked the Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro, among other cities, as part of a campaign push ahead of the October elections, just a month ahead of the Qatar World Cup.\n\nMany of them wore the yellow jersey.\n\nFormer president Luiz Inacio Lula, tipped to win next month’s polls, lashed out at the demonstration on the anniversary of Brazil’s 200 years of independence.\n\n“7 September should be a day of love and union for Brazil. Unfortunately, that’s not what is happening today. I have faith Brazil will recover its flag, its sovereignty and its democracy,” Lula tweeted.\n\nWith love for the jersey, football fan Marina Moreno told Al Jazeera how “frustrated” she was “to see the yellow jersey becoming a symbol of the current government”.\n\n“Today, it is almost impossible to not associate it with the current president and his supporters. It’s automatic and it’s frustrating. I don’t support the current government and I don’t want to be mistaken for one of his supporters so I decided to don’t to wear it any more.”",

    "Brazil: UN experts call for peaceful elections": "GENEVA (22 September 2022) – UN experts today urged authorities, candidates and political parties in Brazil to ensure upcoming general elections are peaceful and election-related violence is prevented.\n\nThreats, intimidation and political violence, including death threats against candidates, continue to increase online and offline, particularly against women, indigenous peoples, Afro-descendants and LGBTI persons – often on the basis of intersecting identities. Such actions generate terror among the population and deter potential candidates from running for office. The disproportionate impact of political violence on women, indigenous peoples, Afro-descendants and LGBTI persons can heighten this chilling effect amongst such groups, limiting opportunities for their representation in decisions affecting them, thereby perpetuating the devastating cycle of exclusion.\n\nThe experts expressed their concerns at the ongoing defamatory campaign and continuing attacks against democratic institutions, the judiciary and the electoral system in Brazil including the electronic electoral system.\n\n“We call on the authorities to protect and duly respect the work of the electoral institutions. We further express our concerns over the impact such attacks could have on the upcoming presidential election, and stress the importance of protecting and guaranteeing judicial independence,” the experts said.\n\n“We are concerned that this hostile environment represents a threat to political participation and democracy and urge the State to protect candidates from any threats, acts of intimidation or attacks online and offline,” they said.\n\n“All those involved in the electoral process must commit themselves to peaceful conduct prior, during and after elections. Candidates and political parties must refrain from using offensive language which may lead to violence and human rights abuses.”\n\nThe experts said that hate speech, gendered disinformation, and incitement by candidates and their supporters during the election campaign period can spark violence.\n\n“The State must ensure that all electoral processes are non-discriminatory, free of disinformation, hate speech and incitement to violence. All fundamental freedoms, including the rights to freedom of assembly and association, as well as to freedom of expression must be upheld,” they said.\n\nThey urged Brazilian authorities to take specific measures, targeted to those most at risk, including women, Afro-Brazilians, indigenous peoples and LGBTI persons, to ensure that everyone can participate freely in the electoral process, without discrimination, harassment or fear of potential repetition of sexual and gender-based violence.\n\nThe UN experts also urged authorities to ensure civil society, human rights defenders, election monitors and journalists can conduct their legitimate work without intimidation, physical attacks or reprisals. “We are deeply concerned at reports of harassment and attacks against journalists, in particular women. Journalists play a crucial role during elections by contributing to a free and inclusive electoral process and the credibility of results,” the experts said.\n\nPast elections in Brazil have been marked by violence and human rights violations, including the murder in 2018 of Rio de Janeiro city councillor Marielle Franco, who was a well-known champion for women’s rights, racial equality and the rights of LGBTI persons.\n\nConcerns about such alleged violations have been raised by several UN experts in a joint communication to the Government of Brazil following the 2018 elections. In this context, “the State must investigate her execution effectively, promptly, thoroughly and impartially, and take action against those responsible in accordance with domestic and international law”, the experts concluded.\n\nENDS\n\nThe experts: Clément Nyaletossi Voule, Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association; Reem Alsalem, Special Rapporteur on violence against women and girls, its causes and consequences; Francisco Cali Tzay, Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples; Mary Lawlor, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders; Morris Tidball-Binz, Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions ; E.

    "Brazil’s Global Ambitions": "Introduction\n\nAs Latin America’s largest and most influential country, Brazil has long played a leadership role in the region, throwing its economic and diplomatic might behind hemispheric integration efforts. It has also increasingly sought a bigger voice for developing countries on the world stage. In addition to its active membership in the United Nations and other major multilateral institutions, Brazil has worked closely with countries such as China, India, and Russia to develop alternative forums.\n\nHowever, a decade marked by economic upheaval and corruption scandals that implicated much of the political establishment has hindered its goals. President Jair Bolsonaro campaigned on a “Brazil above everything” slogan that he argued would help reclaim the country’s sovereignty, but critics say his approach has exacerbated domestic inequalities and led to growing international isolation.\n\nWhy does Brazil matter in world affairs?\n\nBrazil is the largest and most influential country in South America, accounting for about half of the continent’s population, landmass, and gross domestic product (GDP). It is the fifth-largest country in the world and the sixth most populous, with an estimated 214 million people. Brazil plays a major role in world trade: it is a leading producer of soybeans, beef, and iron ore. Moreover, the two-thirds of the Amazon Rainforest that fall within its borders make it central to the global fight against climate change. After the United States, Brazil has the largest military force in the Western Hemisphere, though it has historically relied on soft-power strategies, including foreign aid, to exert its influence.\n\nBrazil wields considerable political and economic clout beyond Latin America. China and the United States are its top two trading partners, and the country has forged closer political and military ties with Russia. It has also asserted itself in nuclear talks with Iran despite objections from the United States. Brazilian forces have at times led peacekeeping missions in Haiti and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the country has hosted international sporting events, including the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\nHow have Brazil’s foreign policy ambitions evolved?\n\nDaily News Brief A summary of global news developments with CFR analysis delivered to your inbox each morning.

It maintained its monarchy until 1889. The foreign relations of its early years were largely preoccupied with regional upheaval, including war with neighbors Argentina and Paraguay. World War I marked the beginnings of Brazil’s role on the world stage, as it was the only Latin American country to participate and the largest South American delegation involved in the negotiations that created the League of Nations in 1920. Brazil’s military contributions to the Allied powers during World War II and its cooperation with the United States during the Cold War drew it closer to the West, even as it advocated for noninterventionism and neutral international institutions.\n\nThis tension grew after Brazil’s republic gave way in 1964 to a repressive military dictatorship, which shared Washington’s fears about communist influence in the region. By 1979, an ailing economy drove the regime to begin a slow process of political liberalization that culminated in the transition to a civilian-led democracy in 1989. This political reform was accompanied by an opening of the heavily state-led economy. Between 1995 and 2010 under Presidents Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (commonly known as Lula), Brazil solidified its reputation as an emerging power with one of the world’s fastest-growing economies. It was under Lula that Brazil “had this really ambitious idea that almost through sheer force of will, it would become a major power,” says Dartmouth College’s Andre Pagliarini.\n\nBrazilian foreign policy emphasizes diplomacy and multilateral institutions. To date, Brazil has participated in fifty UN peacekeeping operations, and it has offered expertise, equipment, and scholarship opportunities to postconflict countries [PDF] including Angola, Mozambique, and Timor-Leste. It has pushed to increase the role of lower income countries, often referred to as the Global South, in global governance in other ways, too: it is in the Group of Twenty (G20), a grouping of the world’s largest economies, and it helped found the alternative economic bloc BRICS alongside Russia, India, China, and South Africa. Brazil is also regularly elected as a non-permanent member to the UN Security Council, and it has joined calls to expand permanent council membership to better represent today’s global distribution of power.\n\nWhat role does Brazil play in regional affairs?\n\nBrazil has long pursued a leadership role, at times butting heads with the United States and navigating tensions with other regional powers. It has largely focused on furthering development and regional stability through economic integration and involvement in multilateral institutions.\n\nIt is a founding member of and among the largest donors to the Organization of American States (OAS), the Western Hemisphere’s premier diplomatic forum. It is also the driving force behind the Mercosur trade bloc, in which it seeks to unite its economy with those of Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. With a combined GDP of roughly $2.2 trillion in 2021, the bloc is one of the world’s largest. Yet, Brasília previously led the opposition [PDF] to a failed U.S. proposal for a hemisphere-wide trade bloc, arguing that the United States’ heavily subsidized agriculture would give its exports an unfair advantage.\n\nMeanwhile, Brazil’s stance toward the region’s authoritarian governments has tested its commitment to diplomacy. Under Lula and his successor, Dilma Rousseff, Brazil sought closer trade and energy ties with the socialist government of former Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez. But Bolsonaro has joined most of the region in refusing to recognize the legitimacy of Chávez’s successor, Nicolás Maduro, and tensions have escalated as the Brazil-Venezuela border has become a hotspot for crime and violence.\n\nRelations with Cuba have likewise worsened despite years of Brazilian efforts to expand oil exploration in the Gulf of Mexico and increase aid to the island. In 2019, Bolsonaro became the first Latin American leader in nearly three decades to vote against an annual UN resolution condemning the U.S.-led embargo on Cuba. The following year, Brazil withdrew from the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), citing the growing authoritarian influence of Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela.\n\nHow has Bolsonaro governed Brazil?\n\nBolsonaro, a former army captain who spent twenty-seven years in Brazil’s Congress, won the 2018 presidential election riding a wave of antiestablishment fervor. Campaigning as a right-wing, socially conservative nationalist, he promised to tackle crime and corruption and right the economy in the face of a series of crises, including a presidential impeachment, a deep recession, a historic corruption scandal, and a sharp rise in violent crime. His controversial moves have included abolishing dozens of civil society groups, cutting funding for federal education, relaxing gun ownership laws, and attacking LGBTQ+ and reproductive rights.\n\nIn contrast to his predecessors, Bolsonaro has embraced anti-globalist rhetoric and has said that international norms and institutions threaten Brazil’s sovereignty. This has led him to distance Brazil from the United Nations; encourage development in the Amazon Rainforest; downplay the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic; and threaten to withdraw Brazil from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Paris Agreement on climate, though he hasn’t followed through. Furthermore, his administration’s moves to isolate former partners, such as Venezuela, have been paired with efforts to form closer ties with like-minded right-wing leaders such as former U.S. President Donald Trump, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nWhat are relations like with the United States?\n\nThe relationship dates to 1824, when the United States became the first country to recognize Brazil’s independence. In the twentieth century, Washington wielded a strong influence over Brazil’s development, including by backing the 1964 military coup and later supporting the country’s democratic transition and economic liberalization. Still, Brazil has at times acted as a countervailing force against U.S. interests. In addition to rejecting the U.S. hemispheric trade proposal, Brasília opposed the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan and condemned the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. During the left-wing Lula and Rousseff administrations, Brazil’s pursuit of closer relationships with U.S. adversaries such as China, Cuba, and Iran also became a source of tension.\n\nBolsonaro’s 2018 election marked a sharp turn toward the right and the beginning of efforts to grow closer with Washington. Bilateral relations were particularly amicable under the Trump administration. In recognition of their partnership, Trump designated Brazil a major non–North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) ally, granting it access to certain U.S. economic and security programs. In 2020, the two leaders signed a limited trade deal.\n\nHowever, under President Joe Biden, Washington and Brasília have increasingly diverged on major issues, including climate action and Biden’s global effort to combat authoritarianism. Bolsonaro has even made unsubstantiated allegations that Biden committed fraud in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Still, there is potential to deepen the partnership on several fronts, says Brazil-based journalist Catherine Osborn, including the leaders’ pledge to prevent further deforestation of the Amazon.\n\nWhat are Brazil’s other major bilateral ties?\n\nChina. Beijing elevated its relations with Brasília to a comprehensive strategic partnership—the highest classification that China awards its diplomatic partners—in 2012. China has since become Brazil’s top trading partner, primarily due to exports of soybeans and iron ore; in 2021, bilateral trade reached a record $135 billion. Though not a participant in China’s Belt and Road Initiative, Brazil is one of the largest recipients of Chinese infrastructure funding in South America. Between 2007 and 2020, Brazil received more than $66 billion in Chinese investment. Brazil is also one of a dozen countries in Latin America that have granted Huawei, the controversial Chinese telecommunications giant, access to its 5G network. Bolsonaro campaigned on ending Brazil’s dependence on China, but the COVID-19 pandemic underscored its continued reliance, as Brazil almost exclusively used Chinese-made vaccines in the early months of global vaccination efforts.\n\nEuropean Union. The European Union (EU) is a major destination for Brazilian agricultural goods, especially soybeans, fruit, and coffee; Germany, the Netherlands, and Spain are the largest European importers. Since 1999, Mercosur has been negotiating a free trade agreement with the bloc, which, if accomplished, would be the EU’s largest trade deal. However, ratification efforts have stalled amid opposition from several EU members. They object to illegal logging in the Amazon, though Brazilian officials assert that these environmental concerns mask EU member states’ desires to protect their agricultural sectors from competition.\n\nRussia. Brazil is Russia’s primary trade partner in Latin America. Over the past twenty-five years, Russian exports to Brazil have grown at an annual rate of 11 percent, reaching $2.2 billion in 2020. Russia has invested billions of dollars in Brazil’s oil and gas sector, infrastructure, and electronics industry, and the two countries collaborate in several multilateral forums, such as BRICS and the G20. But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has complicated relations. Brazil has twice voted in support of UN resolutions condemning Russia’s violation of international law, though Bolsonaro has said Brazil will remain neutral in the conflict. At the same time, leading Brazilian lawmakers have criticized Western sanctions against Russia, which they say are contributing to global shortages.\n\nWhat is the state of Brazil’s economy?\n\nWith a GDP of $1.6 trillion in 2021, Brazil is the largest economy in Latin America and accounts for almost 30 percent of the region’s economic output. In 2016, it overtook Venezuela as the leading producer of crude oil in South America, and it is the world’s top exporter of beef and soybeans; other major exports include iron ore, sugar, and coffee. It is also a major manufacturer, though in recent decades its economy has shifted toward services.\n\nBrazil is considered a mixed economy that has relatively high tariffs and several state-owned enterprises, most notably the oil and gas giant Petrobras. This is the legacy of import substitution industrialization, or ISI, an economic strategy adopted in the 1930s that used protectionist policies to increase domestic manufacturing. But in the wake of economic crises in the 1970s, policymakers introduced reforms to address growing debt and soaring inflation. These included the 1993 Real Plan [PDF], which established a new currency initially pegged to the U.S. dollar to tame inflation, as well as measures to open the economy to trade. Accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995 further accelerated Brazil’s integration into the global trading system, though the country retains some aspects of trade protectionism through Mercosur’s common external tariff.\n\nBy the 2000s, Brazil had become one of the world’s fastest-growing economies. However, falling commodity prices and the series of high-profile corruption scandals helped bring about Brazil’s worst-ever recession starting in 2014. And more recently with the economic disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, the country continues to struggle with limited growth and double-digit inflation. Meanwhile, Brazil remains one of the world’s most unequal countries.\n\nWhat other challenges does Brazil face?\n\nWith general elections set for October 2022, the next administration will be constrained by worsening domestic troubles. Bolsonaro’s primary opponent in the elections is former President Lula, who has promised new approaches to the country’s challenges. These include:\n\nCorruption and political polarization. Brazil ranked 96 out of 180 countries on Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index in 2021. Bolsonaro campaigned on rooting out corruption in the wake of the scandals that led to the impeachment of Rousseff and imprisonment of Lula. In 2019, Bolsonaro signed an anti-crime bill that introduced harsher punishments for corruption, but critics say little progress has been made, and his own administration has been beset by corruption allegations. Election watchdogs worry that Bolsonaro, who has often alleged electoral fraud, will dispute the election results in October should he lose.\n\nClimate and the environment. Deforestation of the Amazon, which hit a fifteen-year high in 2021, has sparked international concern. Many scientists criticize Bolsonaro’s environmental policies, which include opening up the rain forest to more commercial development. By contrast, Lula has proposed creating “green jobs” in the Amazon to replant trees, as well as reopening the Amazon Fund, through which countries previously paid Brazil to monitor and combat deforestation. Still, about 35 percent of energy consumed in Brazil comes from low-carbon sources such as hydroelectric, nuclear, and wind.\n\nCrime and violence. At 22 murders per 100,000 people, Brazil has one of the highest homicide rates in South America; the country also suffers from high rates of robbery, kidnapping, and gender-based violence. Many experts attribute Brazil’s crime rate to wealth inequality, a lack of economic opportunity, and arms and drug trafficking. Bolsonaro has kept up the government’s long-standing “tough on crime” approach, which includes harsh drug laws and strict sentencing.\n\nCOVID-19 policy. Brazil is still grappling with the effects of the pandemic, including economic contraction, increased poverty, and an education crisis that has primarily affected Black and Indigenous communities. More than 680,000 people in Brazil have died, one of the world’s highest per capita death tolls. Global health authorities have criticized the Bolsonaro administration, which downplayed the severity of the virus and opposed lockdown measures. Also, the government’s immunization campaign stumbled over concerns about the efficacy of China’s Sinovac vaccine. More recently, the government has prioritized U.S.-made vaccines. By late 2022, more than 80 percent of the population was fully vaccinated.",

    "A Strategic Moment for the U.S.-Brazil Relationship": "Brazil’s upcoming presidential election on October 2 is not taking place in an international vacuum. To paraphrase an old saying, never entirely accurate, Brazil is not just a “country of the future.” Seismic shifts taking place around the world are placing its current importance in stark relief.\n\nBrazil is emerging as a central actor in global food and energy supply chains, on climate change, in multilateral and regional organizations, and on engagement with China in the Western Hemisphere. Brazil could certainly be more of a partner to the U.S. in addressing these issues. The bilateral relationship, however, has rarely been particularly strategic for either country. Making it more so in the context of the changing international landscape is the challenge.\n\nThe future of bilateral ties rests not only on how Washington engages with Brazil, but also on a successful democratic outcome to upcoming elections and the priorities of the next Brazilian government. The contentious campaign is certainly raising concerns internationally and within Brazil about whether the incumbent, President Jair Bolsonaro, will accept a result where his main rival, former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is declared the victor. But if the door opens to a more dynamic relationship—regardless of who wins—both countries will have a rare opportunity to work together at a critical moment for the hemisphere and for the world.\n\nA more influential global force\n\nMeanwhile, global possibilities for Brazil are opening. Take, for example, the world economy. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has elevated the urgency of diversifying and increasing the medium-term availability of energy and food supplies. Brazil is a central and strategic player, both as a major energy producer and as an agricultural powerhouse. The country’s oil and gas production is now among the ten largest in the world. Brazil is also among the world’s largest exporters of soybeans, corn, meat, sugar and coffee and has a modern agricultural sector capable of expanding production to meet global demand.\n\nAs tensions with China increase and supply-chain relationships are redefined, major but non-aligned economies like India and Brazil have also become key players in the emerging trade and investment frameworks in their regions and beyond. India is increasingly influential and central to efforts by the U.S. to strengthen the broader Indo-Pacific economy by diversifying supply chains and promoting open trade, digital innovation and clean energy.\n\nThe landscape is similar in the Latin American and Caribbean region. The U.S. presented an economic agenda at the Summit of the Americas in June 2022 that emphasized innovation, fighting climate change, opportunities for near-shoring supply chains and economic growth. It is impossible to imagine moving forward strategically in the region without Brazil.\n\nBrazil, like India, can also be more of a partner in multilateral organizations at a time when China is challenging within those institutions, and there is less agreement on the rules of the game for the global economy. Brazil historically is a strong believer and actor in international institutions.\n\nMoreover, as regional trade blocs become more of a factor in the global economy, Brazil’s voice and actions may carry greater weight. The trade grouping of Mercosur, which includes Brazil, is resuming discussions with the European Union on a long-stalled trade agreement. As Brazil emerges as China’s key trading and investment partner in the region, U.S. concerns about the hemisphere’s growing ties to Beijing are only likely to be addressed fully with Brazil at the table.\n\nBrazil, like India, continues to emphasize a largely non-aligned vision of international relations. It should not have been a surprise that neither country took a strong stand on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine; or that both are active in the BRICS organization which groups them with China, Russia and South Africa.\n\nBut no one serious in Brasília is suggesting following the Chinese model of development. Brazil, after all, has also begun the process of accession\n\nto the OECD. The social transformation of Brazil that began after the return of democracy requires further reforms and faster growth\n\nFinally, Brazil remains central to combating climate change globally. Concern is rightly widespread about the accelerating rate of deforestation in the Amazon. The murders this year of journalist Dom Phillips and environmental defender Bruno Araujo Pereira tragically highlighted the challenge. As the international community responds to the unprecedented impact of global warming, however, it is critical to reengage Brazil as a key partner in a more constructive and strategic dialogue than exists at present.\n\nTensions at home\n\nOpportunities for the world to engage with Brazil are significant—but taking advantage of them depends to a great extent on whether Brazil’s politicians respect whatever choice the country’s voters make in the upcoming elections.\n\nPolitical tensions are likely to heighten in the coming weeks, but it would be wrong to think there are no guardrails in Brazil’s democracy. Its legal and electoral systems are stronger than they seem to receive credit for, and there are no indications that Brazil’s military as an institution is looking to intervene on behalf of any candidate. U.S. Defense Secretary Austin visited Brasília in July to convey to his counterparts the importance of a transparent electoral process. Other high-level U.S. officials have paid visits over the past few months transmitting the same message, including Jake Sullivan, the national security advisor, in August.\n\nWhat’s more, many of the sharp differences visible in Brazil’s presidential election are not reflected in national congressional or state elections, which will also be held on October 2. Since Brazil’s return to democracy in 1985, the country’s now more than 150 million eligible voters have favored a largely centrist mix of parties focused on transactional politics. The mix of candidates for October’s legislative and gubernatorial elections look unlikely to alter that pattern.\n\nWashington has expressed strong confidence in Brazil’s electoral system as a model for Latin America—and all hopes are that it will prevail. While the international community would certainly react against any effort to subvert the outcome, it should be equally prepared to welcome another successful democratic electoral process.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin during the 15th Conference of Defense Ministers of the Americas (CDMA) in Brasilia on July 26, 2022. Photo by Mateus Bonomi/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images.\n\nA wide array of venues for collaboration\n\nIn the latter case, there will be the chance to reframe the U.S.-Brazil relationship to reflect both new global realities and strengthened bilateral ties, despite the ups-and-downs of the past decade. Doing so would also require recognizing Brazil as a global player, with its own priorities that do not always mirror those of the U.S. There will inevitably be tension with whomever wins the elections—but that does not preclude the U.S. and Brazil from finding common ground.\n\nThe scale of high-level dialogues and working relationships sustained by the two countries is, in fact, remarkable. There is a U.S.-Brazil Commercial Dialogue; an Energy Forum; a Critical Minerals Working Group; there is the U.S.-Brazil CEO Forum and Defense Industry Dialogue.\n\nSome channels work better than others, but the institutional framework is deep—to which can be added several important recent agreements. Brazil in 2021 became the first Latin American country, and one of only a dozen globally, to sign the Artemis Accords, which promotes the peaceful and transparent use of outer space. This followed a long-sought Technology Safeguards Agreement (TSA), approved in 2019, which permits U.S. space launches from Brazil’s Alcântara Space Center.\n\nBilateral cooperation on pandemic response and medical research is long-standing and cutting-edge. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has worked in Brazil for almost twenty years, where the National Institute of Health (NIH) also has its largest Latin America research portfolio. Cooperation can be traced back decades to the early stages of the HIV/AIDS and Zika pandemics and has continued more recently during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nU.S.-Brazil cooperation on environmental protection continues, too—though it is falling far short of its potential. People-to-people ties are stronger than often recognized, with Brazilians among the top ten visitor streams to the United States. Brazil remains a major trading partner for the United States. Though China is now more important to Brazil for trade, the portion of high-value exports destined for the U.S. is critical—while U.S. investment in the country is still higher than China’s. Brazil remains an important participant in international peacekeeping and is now a major non-NATO ally, creating a new platform for greater strategic engagement between the two countries.\n\nLooking ahead, there is nothing wrong with the U.S.-Brazil relationship maintaining a strongly economic cast. But issues of energy, climate change, food production, digital revolutions, pandemic responses and Chinese investment and trade practices have all become profoundly geopolitical in today’s uncertain world. Addressing them requires cooperation from a wider set of partners than those included in the U.S.’s traditional alliances.\n\nThe Biden administration is currently involved in multiple bilateral dialogues with India and collaboration through the Quad discussions. It is time to approach Brazil with the same strategic mindset and seriousness of purpose.\n\n—\n\nMcKinley is former U.S. ambassador to Brazil (2017-18).\n\nBerg is director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
    "Brazil votes: Indigenous candidates target Bolsonaro stronghold": "This is the first in a three-part series on Roraima in the context of Brazil’s general elections. The project was supported by the Pulitzer Center’s Rainforest Journalism Fund.\n\nNormandia, Brazil – Cheers and applause greet Joenia Wapichana as she arrives at a political campaign event in the Raposa Serra do Sol Indigenous territory in northern Brazil.\n\nIn 2018, Wapichana became the country’s first Indigenous woman elected to Congress; today, she seeks a second term for the Amazonian state of Roraima, where far-right President Jair Bolsonaro has more support than in any other state, according to recent polls.\n\nBut Wapichana says Bolsonaro has been a disaster for Indigenous communities across Brazil, as his pro-mining rhetoric fuels the growth of illegal gold mining operations on Indigenous lands.\n\n“From the moment he opens his mouth to talk about the absurd, illegal, illicit issues that he supports, he puts the lives of the Indigenous people at risk,” she told Al Jazeera in a rare interview with foreign media.\n\nHighlighting the importance of Indigenous political representation, she added: “Thirteen percent of Brazil is Indigenous territories, yet in Congress, they make decisions without our participation.”\n\nIndigenous advocacy groups hail Wapichana as a trailblazer, and this year, a record number of Indigenous candidates — more than 180 — have registered to run in Brazil’s October 2 elections. Yet, with campaigns on shoestring budgets, lacking traditional political party structure and wealthy donors, many face an uphill battle.\n\nIn Roraima, nearly two-thirds of people support Bolsonaro’s re-election, while just 18 percent back national frontrunner and left-wing former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, according to the latest opinion polls by Ipec.\n\n“It’s a frontier state with a mainly conservative population that mostly shares the president’s views on family, land use and Indigenous rights,” political scientist Paulo Racoski, who teaches at the Federal Institute of Roraima, told Al Jazeera.\n\nHe highlighted several of Bolsonaro’s past claims, including that Indigenous people have too much land for their population numbers and that if he were “king” of Roraima, its economy would rival that of Japan or China on account of the state’s mineral wealth.\n\n“Despite being mostly untrue, these are messages that resonate,” Racoski said.\n\nSearching for El Dorado\n\nIn the 16th century, Spanish conquistadors scoured Roraima for the mythical, gold-rich kingdom of El Dorado. In the late 20th century, thousands of migrants from across Brazil, and especially the poorer northeastern region, flocked here in search of opportunities. Many ended up working as gold miners on the Yanomami Indigenous territory, which, since Bolsonaro’s election, has seen a new uptick in illegal mining and related violence.\n\nToday, while there are no legal gold mines operating in Roraima, a seven-metre-high monument to miners outside the legislative assembly in the capital Boa Vista is emblematic of the state’s relationship with mining.\n\n“Politically, it’s tough for a candidate to confront the interests of wildcat mining in the state,” Alisson Marugal, a federal prosecutor based in Roraima, told Al Jazeera. “It plays a large part in the economy.”\n\nLast October, Bolsonaro visited an illegal mining site in Raposa Serra do Sol and touted a proposed bill to legalise mining and other industrial-scale activities on Indigenous lands.\n\n“If you want to plant, you will plant,” the president, wearing an Indigenous headdress, told an assembled crowd. “If you are going to mine, you are going to mine.”\n\nAccording to Roraima’s Indigenous Council, the state’s largest Indigenous rights group, more than 4,000 illegal miners have operated on the Raposa Serra do Sol reserve since Bolsonaro took office in 2019. The council has presented federal prosecutors with a report listing alleged human rights violations linked to these operations.\n\n“The invasion of illegal miners causes environmental degradation, deforestation, pollution of rivers, streams and lakes, an increase in cattle and vehicle thefts, high rates of malaria, STDs and COVID-19 in communities,” notes the report, a copy of which was seen by Al Jazeera.\n\nIt further highlights “drug trafficking, presence of criminal gangs and firearms … increased violence in communities, death threats and persecution of leaders”.\n\nIn April, three people were shot to death in the territory, in a killing authorities alleged might have been tied to illegal mining debts.\n\nWhile federal agencies run frequent enforcement operations to combat illegal mining, there has not been one in Raposa Serra do Sol for more than a year, authorities confirmed. Federal police told Al Jazeera that the last operation to combat illegal mining on the reserve took place last year, but offered no further comment.\n\nThis has led some locals to take matters into their own hands. In one recent example, a surveillance group organised by Indigenous guardians in Raposa Serra do Sol in June burned a raft used by illegal miners to extract gold on the Ireng River, near the border with Guyana.\n\nDestroyed landscape\n\nDuring Roraima’s recent rainy season, Al Jazeera joined three Indigenous guides on an expedition through flooded plains to one of several illegal mining sites at the base of a sacred local mountain known as Serra do Atola, and surveyed the area with a drone. The destruction was striking: the mining encampment opened up like a brown scar across the otherwise green landscape, with dozens of mining pits, some covered by blue tarpaulin to protect miners from the elements.\n\n“Lots of strange people pass through here,” said one of the Indigenous guides, who asked to remain anonymous for security reasons. The guides said that because of the recent heavy rains, the number of miners was temporarily reduced, but they would flow back in again for the dry season.\n\nLast year, the Amazon military command, federal police and environmental agencies raided the site and found 400 people, precision scales, excavation pits, gold and toxic mercury for gold processing. Months later, an Associated Press news agency investigation found the mining camp up and running again, with workers using portable generators to power jackhammers to break the rocks.\n\nRoraima’s Indigenous Council says that businesspeople and politicians from outside the reserve have financed the mining, taking a percentage of the gold extracted, while Indigenous people have often been exploited as cheap labour.\n\n“There is no Indigenous person here that has gotten rich from illegal mining,” Bartolomeu da Silva Tomaz, running for Roraima as Brazil’s only Indigenous Senate candidate, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“The people who get rich from illegal mining are the businessmen … companies that sell machines, motors and equipment, the companies that sell fuel … these guys get rich,” he said.\n\nIf elected, he says he would make the removal of illegal miners from Indigenous lands a top priority — a bold position in a state whose economy is sustained in part by illegal mining, according to federal prosecutors.\n\nLacking a voice\n\nToday, more than 26,000 Indigenous people from five ethnic groups live on the 17,470sq-km (6,745sq-mile) Raposa Serra do Sol territory, which borders Venezuela and Guyana. Unlike many Amazonian Indigenous lands covered in lush rainforest, Raposa Serra do Sol is mostly tropical savannah. Cattle ranching, often associated with deforestation, is also permitted in the area.\n\nIn all of Brazil, which is home to some 900,000 Indigenous people from more than 300 ethnic groups, Roraima has the largest Indigenous population, at more than 55,000. Nearly half of its territory comprises Indigenous lands, and yet, there is no Indigenous representative on its 24-seat state assembly.\n\n“Today we have a voice in Brasilia, which is our lawmaker Joenia Wapichana,” Aldenir Wapichana, an Indigenous leader who is running to be a state legislator, told Al Jazeera. “But on a state level, we still don’t have dignified representation … It’s important to defend our rights, in health, in education.”\n\nHe praised the work of Lula da Silva, who is running again to unseat Bolsonaro and leads polls by a double-digit margin, in ensuring that Raposa Serra do Sol gained full protected status in 2005. Bolsonaro has previously said he would “undo” this demarcation, even though he does not have the power to make that change, and arm local farmers “with rifles”.\n\nIn Brazil’s 2018 elections, Normandia, Uiramuta and Pacaraima, located within the limits of Raposa Serra do Sol, voted against Bolsonaro — the only three municipalities in Roraima to do so. A rock painted with the words “Get Out Bolsonaro” sits near an entrance to Normandia.\n\nStill, public opinion on Bolsonaro remains divided in this region.\n\nLast year, the Society for the Defence of the United Indians of Roraima, which opposes the Indigenous Council’s leadership and advocates for mining and other activities, invited Bolsonaro to an illegal mining site in the Flexal community, where he touted the bill to legalise mining. The group’s leader, Irisnaide Silva, is also running for Congress against Joenia Wapichana.\n\nIn March, the Brazilian government awarded Silva, Bolsonaro and a group of ministers “Indigenous merit” medals, drawing scorn from Indigenous advocacy groups.\n\nWhile Silva did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment, she has publicly described herself as “the Indigenous woman who defends development”.\n\n‘Environmental crisis’\n\nIn Brazil, political parties are allocated public funding based on how many seats they have in Congress. Joenia Wapichana’s Sustainability Network has only two seats in the lower house, compared with 77 for Bolsonaro’s Liberal Party.\n\nCandidates may also receive private donations from individuals, a system that tends to favour those who represent mining or agricultural interests. In addition, candidates can use their own money to help fund their campaigns.\n\nJoenia Wapichana, who declared 20,000 Brazilian reals ($3,900) in assets this year, is competing against Rodrigo Cataratas, a pro-mining businessperson and Liberal Party supporter of Bolsonaro who declared 33 million Brazilian reals ($6.45m) in assets, for one of eight congressional seats for Roraima. The fight promises to be a tough one, and it will not end on election day.\n\nIf re-elected with enough support in Congress, Bolsonaro could try to push through his long-planned bill to allow mining and other industrial activities on Indigenous lands. As is the case with many Indigenous territories, official requests from companies to mine in Raposa Serra do Sol, including proposals for both gold and diamond mines, have increased since Bolsonaro took office, according to data compiled by the monitoring group Amazonia Minada and seen by Al Jazeera.\n\nSome fear that a long-planned hydroelectric dam on the Cotingo River, a project considered strategic by mining interests, could also be resurrected in the event of Bolsonaro’s victory, posing a flood risk to many communities in Raposa Serra do Sol.\n\n“If Bolsonaro is re-elected, we will see a continuation of anti-Indigenous policies,” Antenor Vaz, a former coordinator with Brazil’s Indigenous agency Funai who now works as an independent consultant, told Al Jazeera. “Raposa Serra do Sol would face even more pressure from illegal gold miners, as well as large landowners from outside the reserve.”\n\nBack at her campaign event, Joenia Wapichana maintains that Indigenous representation in Congress is vitally important, both for Brazil and for the planet as a whole.\n\n“Many non-Indigenous people have the same interests as Indigenous people, such as the preservation of the environment,” she said. “The planet is going through an environmental crisis, and we know that a lot depends on the protection of Indigenous territories.”",
    "Brazilian election will determine the future of the Amazon rainforest": "The re-election of president Jair Bolsonaro would severely harm the Amazon rainforest, while his rival Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is promising to reverse much of the recent environmental damage and meet climate change targets\n\nLuiz Inácio Lula da Silva (left) and Jair Bolsonaro are the main presidential contenders in the Brazilian election Foto Arena LTDA/Alamy\n\nThe upcoming Brazilian election will decide the fate of the Amazon rainforest, ecologists have warned, as the country looks set to choose between re-electing current president Jair Bolsonaro or his rival and former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.\n\nSince Bolsonaro took office in 2019, deforestation records have repeatedly been broken as his administration pursued a policy of environmental deregulation. Now, ahead of the 2 October poll, the Amazon is under increased threat as land-grabbers are exploiting what could be their final opportunity to clear trees without retribution, says Philip Fearnside at the National Institute for Research in Amazonia.\n\nThe number of fires in the Brazilian Amazon usually increases in June, when ranchers take advantage of a drop in rainfall to clear land. But even for the dry season, the level of blazes in the Amazon this year has shocked conservationists: 31,513 fires were detected by Brazil’s national space agency in August, the highest number in 12 years and almost half the number seen in the entirety of 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“People realise they can get away with ignoring all the current environmental regulations under Bolsonaro, but the end of his first term is looming and many assume he may not be re-elected,” says Fearnside.\n\nIssues like soaring inflation and hunger levels are high on the political agenda, but the vote is also a referendum on the future of the Amazon, say researchers.\n\n“I don’t say this lightly as a scientist, but this is the most important election ever in Brazil for the Amazon and its survival,” says Erika Berenguer at the University of Oxford.\n\nThe amount of forest lost in the Amazon is now 74.65 per cent higher than when Bolsonaro took office, with 13,000 hectares cleared in 2021 alone, the largest annual figure since 2008.\n\nThis deforestation has pushed the Amazon to a tipping point, say ecologists. Unless this is halted, the rainforest will no longer be able to store enough moisture to support itself and will become a savannah.\n\nExperts blame Bolsonaro for the destruction. The president has stripped environmental regulations, appointed military officials who seek to develop the Amazon to run environmental institutions and publicly encouraged colonisation of the forest. “The Bolsonaro administration has been a complete disaster for the environment,” says Fearnside.\n\nBolsonaro’s main opponent, Lula, was president from 2003 to 2010 and leads the latest polls with 41 per cent to Bolsonaro’s 37 per cent. To win in the first round and avoid a run-off poll, scheduled for 30 October, a candidate must gain 50 per cent of the votes.\n\nRead more: Global forest destruction continues despite COP26 deforestation pledge\n\nFormer governor of the state of Ceará, Ciro Gomes, and senator Simone Tebet are also in the presidential race, but are outsiders, polling 8 and 6 per cent, respectively.\n\nLula says he will reverse the environmental damage by dissolving many of Bolsonaro’s decrees, appointing experts to environmental agencies and purging Indigenous reserves of illegal miners.\n\nThe former president has also proposed more ambitious measures, such as the creation of a carbon-pricing scheme, a ministry dedicated to Indigenous peoples and a National Climate Change Authority to ensure Brazil’s policies are in line with its Paris Agreement targets.\n\nConservationists have raised concerns over mega-dams constructed when Lula was in power, but the former union leader has a strong track record on defending the Amazon: deforestation plunged 72 per cent between 2004 and 2016, when Lula and then Dilma Rousseff – his successor as both leader of the Workers’ party and president – were in power.\n\nLula’s administration made Amazon conservation a central goal for all government ministries, says Suely Araújo at the Climate Observatory in São Paulo. As well as stepping up forest monitoring, they sought to tackle the causes of deforestation by promoting sustainable production and formalising land ownership.\n\nThe task this time would be more complicated. Growing mining communities depend on the illicit gold they extract from Indigenous reserves, new roads have been constructed and regions of the Amazon have become lawless.\n\nRead more: Deforestation in Brazil has rocketed since Bolsonaro became president\n\nIf elected, Lula’s strategy will have to be more ambitious this time round, says Izabella Teixeira, the candidate’s adviser on the environment and Brazil’s environment minister from 2010 to 2016.\n\nAs well as military operations to clear the Amazon of illegal miners, loggers and ranchers, the government has to better regulate food and gold markets, incentivise sustainable production and use technology to make agriculture more sustainable, she says.\n\n“I think that Lula is very cautious to understand that this is a huge challenge and is completely different than it was in the past,” says Teixeira.\n\nLula would unite the government with the private sector, scientists and civil society to tackle the root causes of deforestation, Teixeira adds. He would also seek to restore the international relationships and conservation funding that have been lost under Bolsonaro, making Brazil a global leader on tackling climate change, she says.\n\nMeanwhile, Bolosonaro has played down the growing deforestation. He told the UN General Assembly in New York on 20 September that the Amazon is as pristine today as it was in the 1500s. His office didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\nSign up to our free Fix the Planet newsletter to get a dose of climate optimism delivered straight to your inbox, every Thursday",
    "Will Brazil’s COVID disaster sway its presidential election?": "Brazilians have recognized the more than 600,000 people in their country who have died of COVID-19 with a display of white handkerchiefs.Credit: Buda Mendes/Getty\n\nAccording to official government statistics, more than 685,000 people have died from COVID-19 in Brazil, placing it among the nations with the most fatalities. As infections skyrocketed in Brazil between 2020 and 2021, the country spread the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus beyond its borders, exporting the virus ten times more often than it imported it, according to a study published in Nature Microbiology last month1. The results suggest that the nation — Latin America’s largest — was a COVID-19 epicentre, and that policies implemented by its government, and its leader Jair Bolsonaro, failed to curb the virus.\n\nThe report comes as Brazil gears up to elect its next president in October. Bolsonaro is up for re-election and faces 11 challengers, including former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who led the nation from 2003 to 2010. It remains to be seen whether Bolsonaro’s questionable pandemic response will work against him during the election. Public-health researchers have decried his refusal to implement lockdown measures, his spreading of misinformation about vaccines and his backing of ineffective drugs such as hydroxychloroquine to combat COVID-19.\n\n‘We are being ignored’: Brazil’s researchers blame anti-science government for devastating COVID surge\n\n“For most of the pandemic, the government did not offer a coordinated response, giving room to a wave of disinformation — at times spurred by leaders in the federal government,” says Otávio Ranzani, an epidemiologist at the University of São Paulo and at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health in Spain.\n\nMany of the presidential candidates, including Bolsonaro, are promising to bolster Brazil’s health system, known as SUS. But the country is also now grappling with other issues, including food security and economic inflation, which could trump pandemic concerns when Brazilians head to the voting booth. According to a recent study from the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a higher-education think tank based in Rio de Janeiro, one in three Brazilians could not afford to eat properly in 2021 — the highest proportion in more than a decade.\n\nStill, it’s exciting that health care is being discussed in this presidential election, says Rosana Onocko Campos, president of the Brazilian Association of Collective Health in Campinas, São Paulo. “It is the first time I’ve seen the great majority of candidates say they agree that an increase in federal funding for SUS is needed,” she says.\n\nVirus exporter\n\nAccording to the Nature Microbiology study, SARS-CoV-2 was introduced to Brazil mainly from Europe in early 2020, before the country had implemented any response measures. But between then and September 2021, the nation spread the virus to many countries; the highest number of virus exports went to other South American nations, ten of which border Brazil (see ‘Super spreader’).\n\nSource: Ref. 1\n\nTo draw these conclusions, the team sequenced 3,800 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from infected people in 8 Brazilian states and one neighbouring country, Paraguay. The researchers also analysed genome sequences in the popular data repository GISAID — more than 13,000 from Brazil and about 100 from Paraguay — to understand which coronavirus variants were prevalent, and at what times, between 2020 and 2021. And they compared their sequences with more than 25,000 global sequences to draw conclusions about viral spread. They found that Brazil had most often exported the Gamma variant, which first emerged within its borders.\n\nThe main point of the study, says lead author Marta Giovanetti, a visiting virologist at the Oswaldo Cruz Institute in Rio de Janeiro, “is to discuss the role of populational mobility and the emergence of the first variants of concern” in Brazil.\n\n‘The perfect storm’: lax social distancing fuelled a coronavirus variant’s Brazilian surge\n\nTo Marcelo Gomes, a public-health specialist and computational scientist, the findings make sense, because COVID-19 infections in Brazil remained at a consistently high level from 2020 through September 2021, making transmission to other countries possible. Gomes is based at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in Rio de Janeiro, of which the institute is a part.\n\nThe SUS was overwhelmed by COVID-19, revealing a resource deficit, Onocko says. “We need to requalify services and personnel to increase technical capacity for faster service [and have] better coordination among the federal, state and local governments. It will take an extraordinary effort,” she says.\n\nPromises, promises\n\nAcknowledging that the SUS was overworked during the pandemic, Bolsonaro has promised a 250% increase in funding for health-care workers if he is re-elected. He and Lula — who are leading the polls — have pledged to bolster Brazil’s post-pandemic response, and Lula wants to improve women’s access to public services for the prevention and treatment of disease.\n\nHow these promises would be implemented and paid for isn’t clear to many researchers, however. “The proposals are superficial and don’t go into concrete steps on how they will face the challenges we have,” says physician Gonzalo Vecina Neto, who directed Brazil’s Health Regulatory Agency between 1999 and 2003.\n\nLatin America’s embrace of an unproven COVID treatment is hindering drug trials\n\nVecina worries that even though the candidates have acknowledged the impact of the pandemic, and made various pledges in response, public-health concerns are being overshadowed by the economy and other issues during the run-up to the election. “The sensation I have is we are forgetting what happened”, he says, “and we are now facing new outbreaks such as monkeypox without having learned enough from the pandemic.”\n\nOthers agree. Ranzani says he wants to see more emphasis on strengthening the SUS and Brazilian research in election discussions. “It is fundamental for us to face what the pandemic has caused and still causes.”\n\nThe Brazilian presidential election takes place on 2 October. If none of the candidates gets more than 50% of the vote, the two front-runners will advance to a run-off, which will take place on 30 October.",

    "Religion is shaping Brazil’s presidential election – but its evangelicals aren’t the same as America’s": "With one week to go before Brazil’s presidential election, the two front-runners are battling for the religious vote.\n\nLast month, first lady Michelle Bolsonaro told an evangelical church service that the presidential palace had been “consecrated to demons” under previous presidential administrations – a gibe against former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, commonly known as Lula, and his center-left Workers’ Party.\n\nLula is running again in this year’s election, whose first round is Oct. 2, 2022, and has joined the fray. In his official campaign kickoff in August 2022, for instance, he alleged that the right-wing current president, Jair Bolsonaro, is “possessed by the devil.”\n\nLula has been heavily favored to win the election and retake the office he held from 2003 to 2010. In polls, he currently runs about 15 percentage points ahead of Bolsonaro.\n\nReligious voters are an important part of the story. Bolsonaro – whom international media dubbed the “Trump of the Tropics” for his persona as a conservative firebrand, his anti-democratic streak, and his ability to attract a Christian base – garnered 70% of evangelical support in the 2018 election. Scholars, including me, argue that without the evangelical vote, he would have narrowly lost.\n\nHowever, as a political scientist who has written a book about religious politics in Brazil, I see these comparisons between the U.S. and Brazil as also glossing over key differences. Yes, Bolsonaro and Trump are very similar in how they use religion. Yet the ways evangelical communities work and how religion shapes politics is different in each country – and my own research suggests that conservative Christians will not be as consistent a base for Bolsonaro as they are for Trump and the Republican Party.\n\nWho’s who\n\nOne key difference is the language used: who “evangelicals” are in the first place.\n\nIn Latin America, traditionally a Catholic stronghold, the Spanish and Portuguese term “evangelico” is applied to nearly all non-Catholic Christians, including Protestant denominations that are usually classified as “mainline” or even “progressive” in the U.S. Estimates indicate that around a third of Brazilians identify as evangelical today, up from just a few percentage points in 1970. In the same period, the percentage of Catholics has fallen from over 90% to right about half.\n\nBy contrast, in the U.S. the term “evangelical” is reserved for theologically conservative Protestant groups, as well as Christians who have had a “born-again” experience of religious awakening. Americans also increasingly apply the term “evangelical” in a political sense, to refer to predominantly white political conservatives who are affiliated with Protestant churches.\n\nAs a result, the group of people termed “evangelicals” is much more diverse in Latin America than in the United States – and it’s politically quite diverse, too. All this said, many evangelicals in Brazil do have some tendency to adopt theologically conservative beliefs, such as interpreting the Bible literally.\n\nDozens of parties\n\nA second major difference is the lack of strong partisan affiliation on Brazil’s religious right. Since the 1970s, many Americans are used to associating evangelicalism with the Republican Party. The founding of groups such as Jerry Falwell’s Moral Majority helped spur evangelicals to become a strong base for political conservatism.\n\nHowever, there is no political party in Brazil that can claim such a strong link to evangelicals as a whole. Brazilian politics is famously fragmented, especially on the right, and there are dozens of parties in Congress at any given time. Many parties – mostly conservative ones – court evangelicals, but none have shored up strong loyalty across the wide spectrum of evangelical denominations and churches.\n\nJair Bolsonaro personifies this weak partisanship. Bolsonaro ran for the presidency in 2018 under the Social Liberal Party, but then left the party to attempt to form his own party in 2019 after taking office. Those efforts ultimately failed, and he joined the Liberal Party in late 2021.\n\nEvangelicals may support Jair Bolsonaro, but polls have shown they have little loyalty to whatever party he is affiliated with at the moment. As a result, the president cannot count on his voters to also elect his political allies. Ultimately, this very weak partisanship in the electorate weakens presidents, since they have to negotiate with a highly fragmented Congress.\n\nKey issues\n\nA third difference between evangelicals in Brazil and the U.S. relates to their views on political issues. Like their counterparts in the U.S., religious conservatives in Brazil feel very strongly about issues related to sex and gender. In a striking parallel to recent controversies in U.S. public schools, Brazilian evangelicals mobilized politically over the past decade to oppose efforts to teach children and teenagers tolerance on LGBTQ issues.\n\nHowever, Brazilian evangelicals are much less conservative than their American counterparts on many other issues. This is particularly the case for topics on which U.S. evangelicals often follow cues from the Republican Party. For instance, my research shows that Brazilian evangelicals from a wide range of denominations are highly supportive of environmental action such as preventing deforestation.\n\nMany Brazilian evangelicals have historically tended to come from poor areas and communities of color, leading them to support issues such as welfare policy and affirmative action. About 1 in 3 Brazilian evangelicals identifies as white, versus 2 in 3 in the U.S.\n\nAs a result, they are likely to be attracted to President Bolsonaro for his conservative stances on gender and sexuality. However, they may penalize him for his very weak record of environmental protection as well as what is generally recognized as poor performance on the economy and COVID-19.\n\nTea leaves\n\nWhat does this mean for the upcoming presidential election? Bolsonaro is again attracting evangelicals, though not yet as strongly as in 2018. New evidence indicates that only about a quarter of evangelical churches are getting involved in the campaign so far this year – a substantially lower share than what my co-authors and I documented in 2018.\n\nHowever, particular churches are still taking a strong stance. Brazil’s most politically engaged Pentecostal church, the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, is urging its followers to begin a monthlong “fast” from secular news sources. This will presumably increase the political influence of church leaders, including the church’s head, Bishop Edir Macedo, who is an ardent Bolsonaro supporter.\n\nLike their U.S. counterparts, Brazilian evangelicals tend to be highly religious and believe that religion should influence politics. What that means in 2022, however, is harder to divine than ever. After Bolsonaro’s four years in office, evangelicals may well judge him by his track record, not just by his promises – which could be both a blessing and a curse for him.",
    "'Last Week Tonight': John Oliver Discusses Brazil's Fragile Democracy & Puerto Rico's Power Crisis": "The latest episode of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver dedicated most of its runtime to showcasing how Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, who is currently up for Presidential re-election, is trying to undermine the country’s voting system by suggesting that if he loses next Sunday, it will be because there’s something wrong with the vote counting.\n\nBefore the main story, though, Oliver drew some attention to the fact that Ron DeSantis flew a slate of illegal immigrants to Martha’s Vineyard, in a stunt that put the Florida Governor under heavy fire. To add insult to injury, the show highlights the fact that the political move might have been pitched by Fox News – and sloppily executed. We also learned you can always count on Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny to protest effectively about the country’s constant power outages. In addition, we were reminded that singer and songwriter, Adam Levine, is really bad at sexting, and that, in the wake of Queen Elizabeth II’s death, the British people managed to out-queue every queue that the world has ever seen.\n\nBack to one of the world’s biggest countries, John Oliver kicked the segment off by showing that in Brazil, everything goes when you’re vying for a public office – even nunchucks. And it’s all downhill from there: the show exhibited clips that illustrate how Bolsonaro is pretty much inciting a response akin to Donald Trump's supporters attempting to take over the Capitol on January 6, 2021, should he lose the election.\n\nRELATED: 'SNL' Sets 'Top Gun: Maverick's Miles Teller as Season 48 Premiere Host\n\nLast Week Tonight did not shy away from the shortcomings of Bolsonaro’s presidency. On his watch, Brazil handled the pandemic in disastrous ways, which led to the death of almost 700,000 people. When questioned about it, Bolsonaro stated that “we’re all going to die anyway”, all the while refusing to admit that COVID-19 was a real and serious problem. The Amazon rainforest also took a huge hit during his government, with deforestation reaching an all-time high with 1,000 fires being reported daily.\n\nThe “Brazilian Trump” saw the result of his terrible management in polls: former president Luiz Inácio “Lula” da Silva has been leading by a 10% margin, and has a real shot at winning next Sunday if the polls are correct. The problem is, if Bolsonaro indeed loses, he has a whole army – literally the Army – standing behind him, in what could potentially result in a devastating military coup for a country that rid itself of dictatorship not that many years ago. No amount of nunchucks will be able to save the Brazilian population if this comes to pass.\n\nYou can watch the full episode below:",

    "Domestic action lays foundation for addressing global challenges, Brazil’s Bolsonaro tells UN": "“Our collective responsibility… is to understand the scope of the challenges that make up this watershed moment,” he said, making reference to the theme of this year’s General Debate. “And, from there, build responses that pull their strength from the objectives that are common to all of us.”\n\nThis effort, he continued, must begin within each country.\n\n“It is what we do at the domestic level that gives the measure of authority with which we act internationally.”\n\nMr. Bolsonaro went on to highlight his Government’s efforts to save lives and preserve jobs during the Covid-19 pandemic, including by ensuring emergency financial assistance to those most in need and launching a broad vaccination programme that resulted in more than 80 per cent of the country’s 210 million people receiving vaccines.\n\nThese and other measures mean that Brazil’s economy is in full recovery mode.\n\n“The economy is back on the path of growth,” said the President. “Poverty has increased across the world under the impact of the pandemic. In Brazil, it began to fall sharply.”\n\nHe said it is estimated that, by the end of 2022, four per cent of Brazilian families will be living on less than $1.90 a day – down from 5.1 per cent in 2019. In addition, both unemployment and inflation rates have fallen, and Brazil was the fourth largest destination for foreign direct investment in 2021.\n\nHe also cited strides in food production, making Brazil one of the world’s largest food exporters, as well as achievements in the area of sustainable development, including ensuring that more than 80 per cent of the Amazon Forest remains untouched and modernizing the biofuel industry.\n\n“We have the peace of mind of those who are on the right path. The path to shared prosperity,” said Mr. Bolsonaro. “Shared among Brazilians and, beyond that, shared with our neighbours and other partners around the world.”\n\nAt the same time, he noted that the sustainable development agenda is impacted in many ways by threats to international peace and security, including the ongoing conflict in Ukraine – the fallout of which can already be felt in the global prices of food, fuel and other raw materials.\n\n“We support all efforts to reduce the economic impacts of this crisis. But we do not believe that the best way is to adopt unilateral and selective sanctions, that are inconsistent with international law,” he stated.\n\n“The solution to the conflict in Ukraine will only be achieved through negotiation and dialogue.”",

    "Brazil will channel 2002 vibes to try and end World Cup trophy drought": "Brazil's hopes of breaking their World Cup drought this year are high. Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images\n\nIn the summer of 2002, under a sweltering Japanese heat inside the International stadium in Yokohama, Brazil dazzled the footballing world by becoming the most successful nation in the history of the men's World Cup, beating Germany 2-0 and earning their fifth trophy. Blessed with an embarrassment of riches -- from Rivaldo to Ronaldinho, Cafu and Golden Boot winner Ronaldo \"O Fenomeno\" Nazario -- it was the perfect conclusion to a perfect tournament. Luiz Felipe Scolari's men had emulated the legendary 1970 victory, having also won every match in the competition, and gave Brazilians a sense of redemption against mighty Europe after losing to France four years earlier.\n\n\"I feel pleasure, a joy that the people of Brazil are feeling now,\" Scolari said after the match. \"The joy of knowing we did our job, but it was full of very hard work. Brazil back as world champions -- that is not something we can forget.\"\n\nBack in Brazil, people on the streets celebrated for days, joyful at not just the victory but the fact that the Selecao was finally back where it belonged: at the top of soccer royalty. (Speaking of royalty, Japan's emperor Akihito couldn't attend the ceremony due to national custom, but it didn't matter to Brazilians as Pele, their footballing king, handed the trophy to Cafu instead.)\n\n\"It was an amazing thing that happened in my life. From the combination of the players we had, the generation [of those players], the way we won it... I can't fully describe how I felt that day but it was a very special day for me,\" Kleberson, who was a member of Scolari's historic squad and is now working as an assistant coach at defending MLS champions and newly crowned Campeones Cup winners NYCFC, told ESPN. It was the midfielder's decisive run and pass to Ronaldo (which included a lovely dummy from Rivaldo) that secured the second goal against Germany. \"The fact that I shared this with the best players in the world, it was a powerful moment in my life,\" he added.\n\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, MLS, more (U.S.)\n\nBrazil out to end World Cup trophy drought\n\nTwenty years later and, as a new World Cup appears on the horizon, Brazil are still holding on to those memories from Japan and South Korea, hoping to use them as fuel as their drought continues. Should they lose in Qatar, it will mark 24 years without winning the coveted trophy and, even though there has been some success (three Copa America titles and an Olympic gold medal) and some gigantic failures (see the 2014 World Cup semifinals), two decades without lifting the most valuable piece of silverware in the game is just not acceptable for Brazilians.\n\n\"We know it's been a long time since we have won it. We were close in 2006, and also in 2010, and of course the result at home against Germany... no-one wants to remember that,\" Kleberson says of the 2014 nightmare when Brazil lost 7-1 in the semifinals at the Mineirao stadium in Belo Horizonte. \"I believe, however, that it's all about the generations and a lot of things change. A lot of Brazilian players have changed during those times and thanks to the younger players now, those playing in Europe, Brazil has a great chance again to win the World Cup. It's a process and we need to continue this process in order to see Brazil play the way it can.\"\n\nThis process under Tite has generated some impressive players to choose from. So much so that there is an erratic sense about his squad selections. At least from an offensive standpoint, there are too many cooks in the kitchen and Tite -- entering his final World Cup as manager -- has to get it right. But one thing is for sure, this Brazilian side, which eased its way into qualification in record form (10 wins, three draws, 30 goals scored and only five conceded) has the potential to overwhelm anyone in Qatar. And it's not a stretch to say that the talent not only matches the 2002 squad, but could very well surpass it.\n\n\"This [current] squad is bringing back a lot of the same style from before when we had Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and Rivaldo in the team, we now have players like Neymar, Vinicius Jr., even Rodrygo... they're bringing so much talent to the team,\" says Kleberson. \"But I don't think we should compare too much. It's two different squads. The players from 2002 were of a different generation to what we have now. Brazil, I think ultimately want to play with freedom, one-on-one on the field, with really creative, fast and powerful players.\"\n\nNeymar is one the keys to success. Alexandre Schneider/Getty Images\n\nNeymar leads the way\n\nAll of these attributes begin with the team's obvious leader, Neymar Jr., who is the undoubted headliner of this squad.\n\n\"Neymar Jr. is the best player in Brazil and maybe in the world. The way he plays, with passion and how he contributes on the pitch,\" says Kleberson. \"He can bring a lot of qualities for Brazil and I think he is probably going to push himself and Brazil a lot in order to have the perfect World Cup.\"\n\nEven with the likes of Champions League winners Vinicius Jr. and Rodrygo, or the showmanship of Raphinha or Antony, this is Neymar's team and just like Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo, he represents the final chapter of current World Cup nobility, knowing full well that younger stars are ready to take over. This might not be his last World Cup, but it might be his last to fully take centre stage, and just like Kleberson states, from a contribution perspective, it's coming at the perfect time.\n\nUnder new PSG manager Christophe Galtier, Neymar is having one of his best campaigns -- he leads the scoring charts with seven goals and is tied with Messi with seven assists from seven Ligue 1 appearances. He tops the list for direct goal contributions in Europe's Big Five leagues but, more importantly, Neymar is playing like the Neymar we knew from his Santos days: Free, brave, uncompromising. This is similar to Ronaldo in 2002, who after recovering from injury, decided to wave goodbye to any inhibition. Hence \"that\" haircut, I guess.\n\nOnly three goals behind Pele (77) for the all-time national scoring record, Neymar could have more than one reason to celebrate in 2022.\n\n\"I don't think it will be Neymar's last World Cup, because I think he can play for a long time,\" Kleberson says. \"But I believe he's going to be putting a lot of work in to be at the top and help Brazil win the World Cup. I am looking forward to seeing him be successful in 2022.\"\n\nplay 0:42 Laurens: Close Atletico's stadium after racist chants Julien Laurens calls for Atletico Madrid's next home game to be played without a crowd after fans shouted racist chants about Vinicius Junior during Sunday's Madrid derby.\n\nVinicius Jr. needs to keep dancing\n\nSpeaking of working towards the top, nobody in the game seems to be earning it more than Vinicius Jr. these days, and just like his idol Ronaldinho during the 2002 World Cup, he enters Qatar at 22 years old, ready to take some of the burden from the shoulders of his other idol, Neymar.\n\nHowever, Vinicius Jr. is not coming to this World Cup as a young prodigy ready to make an impact on the game. He's there already. A two-time champion in LaLiga and Champions League winner with Real Madrid, the young forward from Rio de Janeiro is already a star.\n\nThere's something else, however, that might motivate him at this World Cup, and that's the willingness to rewrite the script for Afro-Brazilians. After the grotesque racist remarks made by Pedro Bravo, president of the Spanish Agents Association, about his goal celebrations, Vinicius Jr. responded via social media.\n\n'As long as skin color is more important than the brightness of the eyes, there will be war.' I have this sentence tattooed on my body. This thought is permanent in my head. This is the attitude and philosophy I try to practice in my life. They say happiness is upsetting. The happiness of a Black Brazilian successful in Europe upsets much more! But my desire to win, my smile and the sparkle in my eyes are bigger than all of this. You can't even imagine. I was a victim of xenophobia and racism in a single statement. But none of this started yesterday. Weeks ago, they started criminalizing my dances. Dances that are not mine. They belong to Ronaldinho, Neymar, (Lucas) Paquetá, (Antoine) Griezmann, João Félix, Matheus Cunha... they belong to Brazilian Funk and Samba artists, to reggaeton singers and to Black Americans...they are dances to celebrate the cultural diversity of the world. Accept it, respect it. I'm not going to stop. The script always ends with an apology and an 'I've been misunderstood', but I'll repeat it for you, racist: I will not stop dancing. Whether it's in the Sambadrome, in the Bernabéu or wherever.\n\nThe reaction from the soccer world was overwhelming as Brazilian stars of past and present, including Pele, Ronaldo and Neymar, stood behind their compatriot with words of support. Last Sunday, Gabriel Jesus even performed Vinicius Jr.'s celebration after scoring for Arsenal against Brentford. When Rodrygo opened the scoring for Real Madrid in the derby against Atletico at the Metropolitano, he was joined by Vinicius Jr. by the corner flag and proceeded to dance. Atletico responded to the racist chants by their fans before the game.\n\nThis collective moment of unity from the national team of past and present, from teammates and others from the Brazilian national setup -- mainly made of afro-Latinos -- is more than just words of encouragement for the Real Madrid star. It's a call to action, a battle cry and perhaps a taster for what's to come in November. Let's hope the world is ready for more dancing.\n\nQatar 2022 will be Tite's last World Cup. Edilzon Gamez/Getty Images\n\nTite's selection issues\n\nFrom a selection perspective, here's the problem for Tite -- and it was similar for Scolari back in 2002 -- who do you leave out?\n\nGabriel Jesus is not in the squad for the September friendlies, and neither is the well-liked and often-selected Philippe Coutinho. The latter is not as shocking due to recent subpar performances with Aston Villa (although he improved this past weekend against Southampton) but Gabriel Jesus' absence is perplexing, considering how well he has started with the Gunners.\n\nAfter announcing his squad, Tite stated in a news conference that these omissions are in order to allow other players -- such as Flamengo's Pedro, who leads scoring in Copa Libertadores -- to show what they can do. It's still slightly confusing, however, as this is the final break before the World Cup and you would think that Tite, a glutton for detail, would also want to encourage fluidity and chemistry before heading off to Qatar. Regardless, barring any injury setbacks, Gabriel Jesus should still have a seat on the plane in November, though we might not be able to say the same for Coutinho or other players such as Gabriel Martinelli.\n\nTaking a wider look -- just like 2002 with then-31-year-old Cafu, 30-year-old Rivaldo and 29-year-old Roberto Carlos -- there is valuable experience in this current squad. Alisson Becker (29), Casemiro (30), Thiago Silva (38) and Marquinhos (28) are all well-travelled and will be important voices in the dressing room.\n\nMany often question Brazil's defensive issues, specifically out wide, but this side actually defends very well. Conceding only five goals to get to the World Cup, especially in South America, is not an easy feat and this team are once again emulating another blueprint from the 2002 campaign. In Japan/South Korea, Scolari's side emphasized the need to be collective together, on and off the ball; not only did they end the competition in perfect fashion, but they showed their defensive fortitude against some very tough opposition -- allowing just four goals in total, and only one in the knockout stages.\n\n\"I know Tite really well and I know how much he works with the guys at the back,\" Kleberson says. \"The great players we have at centre-back, they're very experienced. Thiago Silva, Marquinhos, sometimes Eder Militao. They give something different to Brazil in terms of defending. But our goalkeepers are also amazing. Two starters in the Premier League (Alisson for Liverpool and Ederson for Man City), then the rest are top in Brazil so they give a lot of consistency for the team. That's why Brazil conceded only five goals in qualifying.\"\n\nThe upcoming World Cup, for better or worse, is unlike no other. Not only are countries dealing with having to stop domestic competition midway through the season, but they also have less time to fully prepare for it as a squad. Brazilians, however, won't care as the time to reclaim the World Cup trophy is right now.\n\n\"We know Germany has a good team. France has a good team. We know Argentina always plays very well at the World Cup but for me I think Brazil has a very good chance just because of the way they are preparing, performing and even talking,\" Kleberson adds. \"They have a lot of players who can play. I think for a long time Brazil hasn't had a team where they can build really, really good players, and that's what's going to make a really powerful Brazil. I believe in Brazil. I hope at the end of the year, we can have this title and win the World Cup.\"\n\nAfter his success in 2002, Ronaldo was asked how much he wanted to win the World Cup? How often did he imagine lifting the trophy? \"I used to visualize the trophy in front of my eyes and imagine what a wonderful feeling it must be to hold it up in the air. It was a fabulous feeling actually to hold it in my hands and kiss it,\" he told reporters. \"I wanted to become a world champion so badly. Achieving that goal, winning the biggest prize there is to win in football, made me ecstatically happy.\"\n\nIt's time for this current squad to share the sentiment.",

etiquette have overshadowed Brazil’s one-time role as a heavyweight in the world arena, experts say.\n\n“The country is going through a period of relative international isolation and a major reputational crisis,” says Fernanda Magnotta, coordinator of international relations at the FAAP institute in Sao Paulo.\n\n“Not many people want to have their picture taken with our leaders these days.”\n\nShe attributes that to a government where “decision-making is centralized around the administration’s most ideologically driven faction: the president, his sons and closest advisers.”\n\nWhether it is a surge of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest or rows with China and the Arab world, Bolsonaro, who has made relatively few trips abroad as president, has managed to alienate a substantial part of the international community since taking office in 2019.\n\nHis most recent faux pas came Sunday (18 September), when he drew criticism for using a visit to London for Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral to hold a thinly veiled campaign rally.\n\nBolsonaro makes campaign speech in London, on eve of the Queen’s funeral. #Brazil pic.twitter.com/4hhMkzJY4s — Stephen Gibbs (@STHGibbs) September 18, 2022\n\nThe Bolsonaro administration’s closest ties are with hardline conservative governments that are themselves isolated on the world stage: Hungary, Poland and especially Russia, which Brazil has chosen not to sanction for its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBrazilian diplomacy has ceased to be seen as “a means for promoting economic ties and become a means for building far-right alliances for internal political gain,” says Rodrigo Goyena Soares, a historian at the University of Sao Paulo (USP).\n\nEven in its own neighborhood, Brazil has lost influence with insults aimed at a new wave of left-wing governments — such as Bolsonaro’s put-down of Argentina’s “bad choice” in electing President Alberto Fernandez in 2019.\n\n‘Unheard of’\n\nThings got off to a bad start when images of huge wildfires in the Brazilian Amazon sparked international outcry in 2019.\n\nAs Amazon burns, Brazil's Bolsonaro tells rest of world not to interfere Amid growing international criticism over the wildfires raging through the Amazon, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Thursday (22 August) admitted farmers could be illegally setting the rainforest ablaze but told foreign powers not to interfere.\n\nFrance came away particularly incensed, after Bolsonaro got into a spat with counterpart Emmanuel Macron over the environmental destruction — and resorted to mocking First Lady Brigitte Macron’s appearance.\n\nTies have not exactly improved.\n\nJust last month, Bolsonaro’s economy minister, Paulo Guedes, said of France: “You better start treating us right, or we’re going to tell you to go fuck yourselves.”\n\n“It’s unheard of in Brazilian diplomacy — in diplomacy, period,” says Goyena Soares.\n\nBolsonaro bet all his diplomatic chips on his political role model, former US president Donald Trump.\n\n“Bolsonaro’s Brazil aligned itself unprecedentedly with Trump’s United States,” says Felipe Loureiro, of the international relations institute at USP.\n\nBut “the alignment was with Trump and Trumpism,” he adds.\n\nUS-Brazilian relations have soured since President Joe Biden took office last year.\n\nBolsonaro was one of the last world leaders to recognize Biden’s win, as the defeated Trump fought in vain to overturn the election result.\n\nIt was “another bleak departure from Brazil’s foreign policy tradition of non-interference in other states’ affairs,” says Loureiro.\n\nDiplomatic to-do list\n\nThe Brazilian foreign ministry, a venerable institution known as “Itamaraty,” after the palace where it is headquartered, got a jolt when Bolsonaro named obscure diplomat Ernesto Araujo, a die-hard supporter, as foreign minister.\n\nA Trump-loving, China-bashing, climate change-skeptic, the “anti-globalist” Araujo turned Brazilian diplomacy on its head.\n\nForced out in March 2021 amid a seemingly endless series of imbroglios, Araujo was replaced by the comparatively tame Carlos Franca.\n\nBut some analysts point to Bolsonaro’s congressman son Eduardo as the real force in Brazilian diplomacy.\n\nThe man leading Bolsonaro in the polls for the 2 October election, leftist ex-president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva (2003-2010), is vowing to restore Brazil’s international standing and slash Amazon deforestation if elected.\n\nOften more popular abroad than in Brazil, the charismatic but tarnished Lula would have to “reopen dialogue with every country… and resume South-South cooperation between Latin America and Africa,” says Magnotta.\n\nLula would also have to “renegotiate the terms of Brazil’s alliance with the US,” develop a proper China policy and seek “a rapprochement with the European Union around environmental issues,” says Goyena Soares.",

    "How Latin Grammy-nominated Brazilian artist Gabeu turns sertanejo into queernejo : NPR": "Challenging traditional sertanejo, Brazil's Gabeu creates space for queer love songs\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Pedro Nekoi for NPR Pedro Nekoi for NPR\n\nIn celebration of Latinx Heritage Month, NPR Music is spotlighting a series of artists across Latin America who are engaging with their musical heritage in unique ways. From reworking conservative genres for new eras, to teasing out modern sounds from old-school instruments, these artists represent the wide range of experimentation that makes up contemporary Latin music.\n\nIn certain parts of Brazil, it's nearly impossible to escape the sound of sertanejo. Deep in the countryside, in the small towns that line soybean farms and endless stretches of land, you won't find bikinis, coconut water or samba for miles. This is the land of country music and cowboy hats. \"It doesn't matter where you are — every dive bar or restaurant will be playing it,\" says singer Gabeu, who grew up in Franca, a small city in the state of São Paulo. \"That or a duo will be performing sertanejo songs live.\"\n\nMelding elements of rock, pop and forró, the melodic genre is often touted as Brazil's alternative to American country music. But it's also more complicated than that. \"Unlike country, sertanejo is distinctly Latin American,\" says Gabeu, speaking via Zoom from his living room couch in São Paulo. \"It draws inspiration from Paraguayan genres [such as the guaranía or the polka], for example. Maybe that's why it's hard to fully explain what it is.\" What is certain, however, is that it is the biggest genre in the country. Consistently topping the national charts, sertanejo is an increasingly popular — and lucrative — industry. Last year, 60% of the top hits played on Brazilian radio fell under the genre.\n\nPart of what makes the genre so successful is that its artists are decidedly earnest. It's common in sertanejo for lovelorn musicians to sing about longing and heartbreak — experiences people often relate to. But not everyone can see themselves in these stories. Growing up, Gabeu, the son of well-known sertanejo artist Solimões, could never relate to the straight, heteronormative ballads around him. So on his 2021 debut album AGROPOC, which earned a Latin Grammy nomination this year for best sertaneja music album, he set out to change that by singing about finding queer love in the country's largely conservative heartland. Part of a new scene called \"queernejo,\" Gabeu, 24, is among a group of artists leading the charge in the creation of a new kind of sertanejo — one which carves out space for more than one kind of love story.\n\nThat starts with flipping the image of the macho cowboy on its head. For as long as Gabeu can remember, sertanejo singers have been straight. And while they may no longer look exactly like they did in the '90s — women, for example, now hold an increasingly larger stake in the genre — conventional gender stereotypes and heteronormativity still loom large. \"These days the look can feel more modern for men, it's more polo shirts and jeans, less traditional\" says Gabeu. \"Maybe a cowboy hat or a big belt buckle once in a while.\" But, at its core, the genre's relationship with traditional gender dynamics and aesthetics has largely stayed the same, he explains.\n\nGabeu started feeling like the odd one out in his city when he was a teenager. The longer he spent at sertanejo shows and drinking in the barzinhos around town, the more he realized these spaces weren't meant for him. \"I was beginning to understand my sexuality and just couldn't see myself in any of it,\" says Gabeu, running a hand through his short, flame-colored hair. \"That's when I started listening to American pop.\" Finding Lady Gaga helped. \"I loved all the divas, but she was the main one for me,\" he adds with a laugh. \"At one point, I really was that annoying fan.\"\n\nMoving away from Franca to study film in São Paulo was another turning point. \"While I was there, I started getting to know queer artists who were daring to try their hand at genres that weren't pop: people from working class neighborhoods that made hip-hop, queer musicians from the northeast making brega funk,\" an energetic style of dance music born in Recife, Brazil. It soon became clear that if they could do it, he could do it too.\n\nYouTube\n\nThe way Gabeu sees it, sertanejo has a lot to gain from mingling with other genres, from pop to American country to tecno brega. \"I wanted AGROPOC to be playful,\" he says. \"Every song points in a different direction.\" Lyrically, Gabeu's strength lies in his ability to craft evocative scenes out of personal experience — a characteristic shared by the best sertanejos. \"How much longer do we have to love in the dark?\" he asks in the track \"Amor Rural\" over a jangly guitar lick. \"Every piece of this farm is hiding the truth.\"\n\nAGROPOC opens with a fake radio message broadcast in an imaginary world. \"This is AGROPOC, the most popular sertanejo radio station in the country,\" says Gabeu in the first track. It's wishful thinking, he tells me, but not necessarily impossible. In 2020, Gabeu and non-binary sertanejo artist Gali Galó launched the country's first queernejo music festival, Fivela Fest. Bringing together live performances and talks, it sought to introduce the genre to a wider audience. \"People like Alice Marcone, Reddy Allor and Zerzil performed,\" says Gabeu. \"It wasn't hugely popular, but we managed to reach our audience.\"\n\nFor Gabeu, it's impossible to separate the onset of queernejo from Brazil's broader political situation. Over the course of the past four years, a remarkable number of sertanejo artists have spoken out in favor of Brazil's far-right, anti-LGBTQ+ President Jair Bolsonaro. \"That really messed with me,\" says Gabeu.\n\nIt was also about what the president represented to Gabeu. \"I remember having a horrible experience around the time Bolsonaro was elected at a Shania Twain concert in Barretos.\" During the show, Twain invited a gay couple onto the stage and one of them proposed. \"I've never heard so much booing in my life,\" the artist says.\n\nIn some ways, the genre's support for the president is still ongoing. In 2018, leading artist Gusttavo Lima declared his support for the president in a video in which he is seen shooting a rifle. Ahead of the presidential election on Oct. 2, the duo Mateus e Cristiano launched a jingle for Bolsonaro's campaign.\n\nStill, the scene is changing. \"In some ways, queernejo was born out of this gigantic need to redefine the genre's relationship with Bolsonarismo,\" says Gabeu. \"It's also why we try to reclaim symbols too, even when it might seem like we're leaning on stereotypes: I want people to look at a cowboy hat and not see a Bolsonaro supporter.\"\n\nThis feels like a distant reality, but recent strides made by queer country artists in North America such as Orville Peck, whose song \"Dead of Night\" scored a highly-discussed scene in the HBO hit series Euphoria this year, make him hopeful. For Gabeu, there's no reason queernejo can't enter the Brazilian mainstream in the same way one day.\n\nFor now, however, his focus is reaching queer Brazilians who, like him, grew up thinking sertanejo wasn't for them. \"There are so many people in the LGBTQ+ community living in the countryside,\" he says. \"How crazy is it to think that this is the first time they've been able to see and hear themselves in the genre?\" It's no surprise many might feel inclined to change the radio station when sertanejo plays. But, if they hear a queernejo song instead, they might be inclined to keep listening.\n\nCarolina Abbott Galvão is a researcher at Monocle magazine.

    "Bolsonaro's gun laws arm Brazil's brazen bank thieves": "UBERABA, Brazil, Sept 21 (Reuters) - In August last year, Brazilian farmer Reinaldo Huijsmans reported a break-in at his house in the town of Maracaju, where thieves stole six legally registered weapons, including a T4 Taurus assault rifle.\n\nHuijsmans, 39, is one of hundreds of thousands of Brazilians now registered to own guns, a group whose ranks have surged six-fold since far-right President Jair Bolsonaro was elected in 2018 and began loosening gun laws.\n\nTwo months later, Huijsmans' T4 turned up 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) away, in the hands of a heavily-armed gang of alleged bank robbers ambushed and killed by cops near the city of Varginha, in Minas Gerais state, according to an inventory of weapons apprehended from the gang seen by Reuters.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nThe unexpected journey of Huijsmans' assault rifle, which Reuters traced using the T4's serial number provided in his original statement to police, has not previously been reported.\n\nIts presence in the hands of a group of alleged bank thieves highlights what Federal Police and public security experts say is an inevitable consequence of Bolsonaro's gun liberalizations: the criminal use of Brazil's fast-growing stock of legal weapons.\n\nThere is mounting evidence that legitimately acquired high-caliber weapons are leaking onto the black market.\n\nWhile the fragmented structure of Brazil's security forces makes it difficult to tally how many such weapons have appeared at crime scenes, over a dozen federal and state police officers told Reuters that an increasing number of legally bought firearms are being used to commit crimes across the continent-sized nation.\n\nMany of those have reached the most violent criminals in Brazil, the country with the world's highest number of murders.\n\nThe men holed up in Varginha were part of a new breed of bank robbers conducting a wave of high-impact assaults across the interior of the country, police say. Known locally as \"novo cangaco\" gangs, these specialized crews terrorize cities, blow up bank safes and use human shields to escape, often stealing millions of dollars, Reuters reported in a related story. read more\n\nBolsonaro, a nationalist former soldier, has made it easier for Brazilians to bulk-buy firearms by registering with the army as hunters, marksmen or collectors, known as \"CACs.\" With his encouragement, nearly 700,000 Brazilians have now accredited as CACs, up almost 500% since 2018.\n\nBolsonaro says those weapons are being bought by \"good\" Brazilians, helping to reduce the murder rate, which has fallen steadily since before he took office, from 27 per 100,000 in 2017 to 19 last year. Experts dispute his theory, warning there is a strong long-term link between gun deaths and the number of firearms in circulation.\n\nIn July, Reuters reported that Brazil's Federal Police disapproved of Bolsonaro's gun policies, arguing they would put more weapons in the hands of criminals. read more\n\nThere are now signs those fears are becoming a reality.\n\n\"We constantly have issues with weapons bought by people with CAC permits,\" said one senior Federal Police officer, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the politically sensitive subject. \"Sadly, we're going to have problems with this for decades.\"\n\nBolsonaro's office did not respond to a request for comment. The Federal Police directed questions to the Army, which grants CAC permits. It, too, did not respond.\n\nNEO-BANDITRY\n\nNamed after \"cangaceiros,\" the ragtag bandits who roamed the arid northeast in the late 19th century, Brazil's \"novo cangaco\" gangs have benefited from Bolsonaro's looser gun laws, according to police probes and interviews with officers involved in gun control and organized crime investigations.\n\nIn December last year, a group disguised in police uniforms robbed nearly 4.5 million reais from an armored truck in the southern city of Guaiba. Investigators located one of the weapons used in the assault - a Brazilian-made IMBEL 7.62 mm assault rifle - and found it had been bought by a 36-year-old CAC permit-holder paid 2,000 reais to buy the weapon on behalf of the gang, according to Rio Grande do Sul state civil police.\n\nIn July, police in the southern city of Itajai arrested three alleged bank robbers suspected of stealing around 230,000 reais in two bank heists. The group, which police said was planning another imminent assault, was found with two pistols, a shotgun and two T4s - all of which were legally acquired by one of the CAC-registered gang members, Eduardo Ferraz, the lead detective on the case, told Reuters.\n\n1/3 A banner with a photo of Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro is seen at the Tatico Brasil Security training center, which provides training for private security guards, some of whom will serve in banks, in the Uberaba city in Minas Gerais state, Brazil August 4, 2022. REUTERS/Leonardo Benassato Read More\n\nOf all the weapons now available to Brazil's gun fans, the T4 has emerged as the weapon of choice for its gangsters.\n\nManufactured by Brazilian gunmaker Taurus SA (TASA3.SA), the T4 hit the local market in 2019 as a direct result of Bolsonaro's newly liberalized gun laws. It has been a huge success for the company, which has sold around 60,000 units of the 5.56 mm semi-automatic carbine, helping to lift its share price around 350% since the start of 2019.\n\nBefore the looser rules, an imported 5.56 mm assault rifle equivalent to the T4 cost 60,000 reais on the black market, according to Ivan Marques, managing director of The International Action Network on Small Arms.\n\nBut now, Marques said, anyone registered as a CAC can legally buy a T4 \"for 16,000 reais with a factory guarantee.\"\n\nHalf a dozen federal officers told Reuters that Brazil's gangs - and particularly Sao Paulo's First Capital Command (PCC), South America's most powerful criminal franchise - are increasingly using legalized gun-owners as straw buyers to replenish arsenals that, one officer said, will last \"a hundred years.\"\n\nA common tactic used by gangs - as seen in the case of Huijsman's T4 - is to steal weapons from CAC permit-holders' homes.\n\nBut sometimes, police say, the legal buyer is in on the ruse. Last month, Sao Paulo state civil police said they had arrested a CAC permit-holder with 700 5.56mm rounds in his car. He confessed to having sold weapons to the PCC that he had previously reported as stolen.\n\nHuijsmans told Reuters he was an innocent victim of a burglary. Jackson Frederico Vale, the detective probing Huijsmans' case, said he didn't suspect the farmer of foul play.\n\nIn other cases, gangsters are withholding their criminal pasts when they apply for CAC permits, banking on overworked army bureaucrats to wave through their applications.\n\nIn July, Federal Police in the Minas Gerais city of Uberaba arrested a well-known local criminal with family ties to the PCC for failing to alert army CAC certifiers to his criminal background. The 36-year-old, who had previously been charged with murder, drug trafficking, and theft, was found with seven firearms, including a T4.\n\nNOVO CANGACO\n\nSituated on a major cocaine trafficking route between Paraguay and Brazil's Atlantic ports, Uberaba and nearby towns in Minas Gerais have proven fertile ground for \"novo cangaco\" raids. The wealthy beef-farming city has suffered two major bank robberies in the last five years, including the 2019 assault of its main Banco do Brasil branch.\n\nOn Oct. 31, 2021, Minas Gerais military police and Brazil's Federal Highway Police carried out two raids against alleged bank robbers hiding out near Varginha, killing 26 of them. No cops were injured, with the lopsided toll leading to accusations of illegal executions that are now being probed by the Federal Police.\n\nAs justification for the raids, Minas Gerais military police briefed reporters that the gang was about to rob 65 million reais ($13 million) from Varginha's Banco do Brasil. They also said they believed the alleged robbers were the same crew that had hit a Banco do Brasil branch in the city of Aracatuba a few months earlier, although they presented no evidence.\n\nMany of the 26 people killed were career criminals, with checkered pasts including murder, theft and drugs charges, according to investigators. At least four were from Uberaba.\n\nA Federal Police officer involved in the investigation of the killings agreed the crew was planning a robbery. But the officer, speaking anonymously to discuss an ongoing probe, said the target was an armored vehicle carrying 20-30 million reais.\n\nAfter the raids, police combed through the gang's arsenal. They found a .50 machine gun, capable of taking down a low-flying helicopter, two 7.62 mm assault rifles, and around a dozen 5.56 mm carbines - including Huijsmans' T4.\n\nMarques, the gun expert, said Huijsmans' rifle wouldn't be the last legally acquired firearm to turn up at a crime scene.\n\n\"It's certain that many of those weapons which entered circulation in the last four years will end up in the hands of criminals,\" he said.\n\n($1 = 5.1964 reais)\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nReporting by Gabriel Stargardter; Editing by Brad Haynes and Frank Jack Daniel\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

State and municipal officials can continue to modify their local restrictions depending on local disease activity and government preparedness to respond to the disease.\n\nInternational Travel Restrictions\n\nAll travelers aged 12 years and over entering from abroad are required to present proof of having been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 more than 14 days before entry or a negative result from a COVID-19 RT-PCR or antigen test taken no more than 24 hours before travel. If travelers get on multiple flights but remain inside the airport during connections, the time count begins from the moment they board the first flight of their journey. Proof of vaccination documents and test results must be in Portuguese, Spanish, or English. Children aged 11 or younger are not subject to any COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nForeign citizens are allowed to enter Brazil by air, land, and water for visits of no longer than 90 days. Those entering via land and water borders are subject to the same vaccination and testing requirements as those entering the country by air.\n\nAll restrictions are subject to amendment at short notice.\n\nAdvice\n\nFollow all official instructions. Abide by national health and safety measures. Reconfirm all travel arrangements before arrival. Consider delaying traveling if experiencing symptoms associated with COVID-19, as they may prompt increased scrutiny and delays. Liaise with trusted contacts for further updates and guidance. Maintain contact with your diplomatic representation. Ensure contingency plans account for further disruptive measures or extensions of current restrictions. Reconsider and reconfirm nonemergency health appointments.\n\nResources\n\nMinistry of Health\n\nSao Paulo State - COVID-19\n\nRio de Janeiro State - COVID-19",

Given we had the first LatAm Tech Week here in Brazil with several events, high quality content and intense networking - I will start out with the usual market overview but then jump to a description of everything that happened. The news and deals of the week will be consolidated at the end, instead of doing on a day by day basis. Hope you like it!\n\nDespite the global tech market correction, recent political transitions, rising internet adoption and a growing pool of tech talent are causing a surge of private market activity in Latin America. This week, Pitchbook & Intralinks released a new market brief called Private Investment in LATAM: An Emerging Market's Response To Global Headwinds. It is no news that VC activity skyrocketed globally last year. Latin America was no exception, with deal value more than tripling YoY. Several high profile investment firms are turning to the region, as other emerging markets (such as China) become more challenging to invest. LatAm startups are grasping the attention of global investors, with 2022 having the highest cross-border deal value from non-Latin American investors year-to-date (YTD) than any year prior to 2021. Although it is highly unlikely that venture dealmaking will match the unprecedented levels generated in 2021, there are still a lot of deals happening in the region with investment sentiment becoming “cautiously optimistic”. The region faces significant challenges in the near term (such as Brazil’s upcoming elections); however, the development of its tech ecosystem is a positive signal for investment activity and investors will continue to seek opportunities in this emerging market.\n\nSpeaking of Brazil, Sling Hub & VC Fellows released their new Startup Index. Using the Sling Hub Platform intel, they gathered 3.7 million pieces of data from the Brazilian innovation market and calculated the relative weight of each of these variables. The result is a robust statistical measure that tracks the ecosystem's evolution, enables quick analysis, and helps to predict trends. The image below shows how the index evolved through time. If you want to understand more on the weights of the different variables, and some conclusions drawn from the calculation, go to the link above and download the August 2022 Report.\n\nOn to a less optimistic view, Pitchbook also released its Q3 2022 report on Down Rounds, Impacts, and Exit Opportunities. The decline in public markets has left many private startups with extended valuations and no exit opportunities in sight. VC investor advice shifted from growth at all costs to a focus on breakeven. However, just 6% of completed rounds in 2022 have been at lower valuations than the company’s previous investment, the majority of them occurring at the late stage. Analyzing historical data, companies taking on a down round often continue to grow. Only 13% of companies raising a down round from 2008 to 2014 were unable to raise a new round or exit immediately after the down valuation investment. Nearly 20% of post-down round exits occur via PE buyout, which is a significantly higher proportion than what is seen in the broader venture exit dataset. Nevertheless, as a natural mechanism of a market, down rounds remain unavoidable for some companies within VC. They will likely increase in years after significant market growth, but data shows that these rounds aren’t a contagion and are limited to a few companies within a certain market. I always end on a positive tone :)\n\nWomen’s Update: This week QED Investors, Canary and Itau BBA joined forces to host a Women Founders & Investors breakfast in Brazil. The result was a group of 60 women of different nationalities networking, exchaning experiences and lessons and showing that we are super important to the tech ecosystem!\n\nLatAm Tech Week:\n\nThe 2022 report was launched live (video in the link above) during Canary’s and Atlantico’s Tech Summit. Key topics of the report include: Tech Industry Outlook, The Future of Work, Research with Founders, Brazil’s PIX, Fintech, SMB Digitalization, Web3 and Crypto and much more. To download the full report, click here.\n\nKickstarting the LatAm Tech Week, the summit attracted top notch founders from the region and also global funds such as A16z, QED Investors, Quona, NFX, Riverwood and others. The event started out with the launch of the report mentioned above, then highlighted founders from companies such as Alice, Loft and Gupy and finally ended with intense networking among participants.\n\nStartSe gathered ~1500 people in a two-day event that discussed fintech trends. Topics such as Cashless economy, Crypto, C-Commerce, Open Finance, BaaS, Embedded Finance and others were discussed. I participated in a panel with Rodrigo Tognini co-founder and CEO of Conta Simples and Ricardo Figliolini co-founder of Marvin. We discussed the recent Brazilian regulation of credit card recievables, the local Central Bank’s stance focused on fueling competition and tech development and the big opportunity in B2B Banking.\n\nLatitud gathered +1000 tech founders, operators, investors in a one-day event packed with good content. On stage, Sergio Furio from Creditas and Sergio Fogel from DLocal discussed fintech trends. Pete Flint from NFX joined Brian Requarth co-founder of Latitud to discuss main lessons for CEOs of tech startups. Closing the day Mike Krieger from Instagram described the company’s trajectory since inception in a panel moderated by Gina Gotthilf co-founder of Latitud. Great event with literally the entire LatAm tech ecosystem present, apart from the global investors mentioned above.\n\nWomen Founders & Investors by QED, Canary & Itau BBA - 22/9\n\nDescription above on the “Women’s Update” of this week.\n\nDeal drivers in Brazil, H2 2022: preparing for what is ahead - 22/9\n\nEvent organized by Brazil’s M&A Community for around 150 people. Given the importance of tech in the recent M&A activity, I participated in a panel together with Karolyna Schenk, M&A Director at Totvs, Alexei Bonamin partner at TozziniFreire Advogados, an important local law firm and Edoardo Frechet, VP at Itau BBA’s IB Tech team to discuss the outlook for tech and also what drived digitalization in Latin America in the past 10 years.\n\nSelected News\n\nIncreasing its presence in the institutional segment, Brazilian fintech Warren announced the acquisition of Renascença DTVM, the main institutional broker for public securities in Brazil.\n\nHeru, Mexican tech-based tax solution that automates tax filing procedures for consumers and SMEs, raised a seed round of USD 6mm with funds such as GFC and Flourish Ventures.\n\nKavak, Mexican online used car marketplace that facilitates processes and paperwork and generates a personalized financing and guarantees system for each client landed USD 810 mm in debt financing with banks such as HSBC, Goldman Sachs and Santander\n\nDomo Invest, Brazilian VC, annouced that it is currently raising its fifth fund of BRL 200mm and that partner Marcio Zarzur is being promoted to controlling shareholder.\n\nOn Another Note\n\nWhat did I learn from readers?\n\nI recently got to know a newsletter called Voice Bites, which delivers the most relevant developments in the conversational AI space every month.

    "Brand New GOL Boeing 737 MAX Arrives In Brazil": "Boeing Stock Code: BA Date Founded: 1916-07-15 CEO: Dave Calhoun Headquarters Location: Chicago, USA Key Product Lines: Boeing 737, Boeing 747, Boeing 757, Boeing 767, Boeing 777, Boeing 787 Business Type: Planemaker\n\nLast week, Brazil's largest domestic airline, GOL Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes, got just a little bit bigger. The airline received its thirty-seventh Boeing 737 MAX, a continuation of its fleet renewal strategy.\n\nThe latest GOL Linhas Aéreas (GOL) aircraft departed the US on Wednesday from Seattle Boeing Field (BFI) at 14:33. The first leg of the Boeing B737 MAX 8's ferry flight took 7:11 hours to cover the 3,600 miles (5,800 km) to the Dominican Republic, landing in Punta Cana International Airport (PUJ) at 00:44 AM on Thursday. After 52 minutes on the ground, it departed at 01:36 AM and landed in Brazil at Belo Horizonte's Tancredo Neves International Airport (CNF) at 09:13 AM.\n\nChina's loss is Brazil's gain\n\nThe second leg of the B737 MAX 8 delivery flight took 6:37 hours, flying from Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic to Belo Horizonte in Brazil. Data: Flightradar24.com\n\nGOL will be the first operator of the aircraft, registration PS-GPH and MSN 44310, but it was initially destined for Urumqi Air, a Chinese low-cost airline owned by Hainan Airlines. Urumqi Air did not take it up, and with the current hiatus affecting Boeing deliveries to China, it has been delivered to GOL in Brazil. Planespotters.net lists the 737 MAX 8 as being 2.9 years old, so the upside is that another of Boeing's long-parked 737 MAXs has found a new home and is soon to enter commercial service.\n\nGOL is working through a fleet renewal program, bringing in MAXs to replace its existing Boeing 737NGs. According to ch-aviation.com, GOL has 21 B737-700s with an average age of 18.3 years and 87 B737-800s that, on average, are close to 12 years old. The airline is totally invested in the 737 MAX, with outstanding orders for 66 737 MAX 8s and 25 737 MAX 10s that will sit alongside the existing 37 MAX 8s now in the GOL fleet. In a recent investors update, GOL said it plans to end this year with a fleet of 44 737 MAX 8s and 92 737NGs and return 19 older aircraft.\n\nFind the latest South American aviation news here\n\nFreighter conversions for 737-800s\n\nThe Boeing 737-800 dominates GOL's present fleet, with some now destined for freighter conversion. Photo: Boeing\n\nMore fleet expansion is planned from GOL's entry into the freighter business in partnership with the e-commerce platform Mercardo Livre. The agreement was announced in April, and GOL said it would convert up to 12 737-800s into BCF (Boeing Converted Freighter) aircraft. The 737-800s will come from GOL's fleet and, when fully converted, will have the capacity to carry up to 24 tons of cargo. The airline's in-house MRO business, GOL Aerotech, will do the conversions in Confins, Brazil. Ch-aviation.com data shows that GOL has one B737-800(BCF) already in service.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2022, GOL carried 6.03 million passengers, had net revenues of BRL3.24 billion ($616 million) and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of BRL50.8 million ($9.66m). This was a vast improvement from the second quarter of 2021, when it carried 2.92 million passengers, had revenue of BRL1.03 billion ($196m) and a loss of BRL765 million ($145m). GOL's per day aircraft utilization in 2Q 2022 was 10.2 hours compared to eight hours last year, and it recorded 45,538 departures this year, more than double the 19,662 in 2Q 2021.\n\nHow was your experience on one of GOL's MAX 8s?\n\nSource: aeroin.net",

    "Brazil’s Catholic Church frowns on proposals to legalize homeschooling": "SÃO PAULO – Facing opposition from both the Brazilian bishops and the National Association of Catholic Education, conservative Christian groups are pressuring President Jair Bolsonaro and lawmakers to legalize homeschooling.\n\nBrazil’s Supreme Court ruled in 2018 that although homeschooling was possible, specific legislation was necessary to allow it.\n\nSeeking a second term in elections scheduled for next month, Bolsonaro has met with advocates of homeschooling on two different occasions since the end of August.\n\nIt is estimated that around 30,000 families in Brazil educate their children at home, despite the legal ambiguity surrounding the practice.\n\nWithout specific legal protection, they risk being charged by the authorities with the intellectual neglect of their children.\n\nIn May, a homeschooling bill endorsed by Bolsonaro passed in the Chamber of Deputies, but still must be approved in the Senate.\n\nAlthough the Catholic Church in other countries has been supportive of homeschooling – or at least neutral on the subject – the church in Brazil has been firmly opposed to the legislation.\n\nAccording to Ascânio Sedrez, an experienced principal of Catholic schools in São Paulo and a member of the National Association of Catholic Education (ANEC), homeschooling “is a bad idea on several levels and seems especially inappropriate in the current Brazilian situation.”\n\n“We have just witnessed firsthand how most families clearly were not able to handle the learning process of their children at home during the pandemic. Now those people want to take education to families again,” Sedrez told Crux.\n\nIndeed, educational assessment data released by the government on Sept. 16 showed that the COVID-19 pandemic had a brutal impact on the literacy development of elementary school students. Experts fear the possible consequences of such deficiencies for future learning.\n\nSedrez argued that the Bolsonaro administration has been continually dismantling previously consolidated educational policies with the aim of “reducing costs with schools and opening the way for their privatization.”\n\nHomeschooling in that sense is, at the same time, an excuse for Bolsonaro’s free market agenda and a way of “showing to his constituents that he is a pro-family president, given that he supports the rights of families to educate their children at home,” he said.\n\nAlthough homeschooling is mostly supported by Evangelicals and Pentecostals, many conservative and traditionalist Catholics also prefer educating their children at home.\n\nIn the politically charged scenario in Brazil since Bolsonaro’s election in 2018, many conservative Catholics have been increasingly suspicious of schools, frequently perceived as places of ideological indoctrination by left-wing groups. That has been a top reason for the new interest in homeschooling.\n\n“Schools combat mostly the Catholic Church and its 2,000-year thought. It is sad to see that the episcopate is aligned against the possibility of a truly Catholic education for our children,” said Ricardo Silva, father of a one-year-old son.\n\nFor two years, he and his wife have been members of the Society of Saint Pius X, a traditionalist fraternity founded by Archbishop Michel Lefebvre in 1970 that is in irregular communion with the Vatican. Silva is worried about secular education, “which attacks the church and struggles against its doctrine, at the same time relativizing the knowledge in several areas,” he said.\n\n“The most important thing about homeschooling is that I will be able to teach my son about the church doctrine the way it used to be taught till 60 or 70 years ago. Besides, learning at home is faster and more efficient than learning at school,” Silva said.\n\nHe said that he does not fear his son will lose anything by not going to school because his family is able to provide a good environment for socialization.\n\n“I believe families should have the right to teach their children at home,” he said.\n\nSedrez said homeschooling “appears for some people as a way of preserving a Catholic identity that has been perverted by the world.”\n\n“But it is part of an ideology that opposes public schools and universities. It opposes everything that can lead to emancipation,” he added.\n\nMany private companies have been giving signs that they are ready to get into the market of educational systems to help families in homeschooling.\n\n“They know there is money in it. Many of those families have financial conditions of hiring a tutor. It is really an elitist project,” Sedrez said.\n\nAuxiliary Bishop Joaquim Mol Guimarães of Belo Horizonte, one of the members of the episcopate who has been following the debate on homeschooling over the past few years, argued that it is never a good solution, given that it disregards relevant economic disparities in society.\n\n“That is a rather excluding and elitist project that may have terrible consequences if the poor end up being put aside – like they are in other aspects,” he told Crux.\n\nGuimarães, who is the president of the Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais, stressed that both families and schools have fundamental roles in the learning process, but “schools can at times supplant the families that lack the conditions to adequately offer the basic elements of education.”\n\n“Schools have an indispensable relevance because they put children side by side, something that is primordial for human development in learning projects guided by well-prepared teachers,” he said.\n\nSedrez emphasized that a truly Christian educational perspective has to consider that “ours is a gregarious species, so education must be a collective experience.”\n\n“Besides, Catholics need to be educated for common life – in community and in society as a whole,” he said.\n\nThe parents’ ability to properly teach their children is another concern among education experts in Brazil.\n\nAccording to Guimarães, good teachers are trained to help students think about reality and its meaning.\n\n“We cannot be sure that family members, even though they have studied to have a career in this or that field, have the conditions and the pedagogical resources necessary to teach all subjects,” he said.",
    "Kaka: Both Brazil and Argentina have a great chance of winning the 2022 World Cup": "Ricardo Izecson dos Santos Leite, better known as Kaka, has swapped his football boots for running shoes ahead of a marathon in Berlin this weekend, but he is already looking beyond that to the World Cup.\n\nKaka has been preparing for the race for three years and will take it on alongside his brother Rodrigo.\n\nHe spoke to MARCA exclusively in Berlin before the marathon took place on Sunday morning.\n\nQuestion: The first is an almost obvious question: Why does he run?\n\nA: I always liked coaching and when I left professional football I continued to do it but the truth is that I no longer had a goal. It was after talking to some people in Brazil that I decided to run a marathon.\n\nQ. Will there be other marathons after this debut?\n\nI don't know. What I want to do is finish this first one and then we'll see because the last two months of training have been very hard.\n\nQ. What is the difference between playing a Champions League match and running a marathon?\n\nThe pressure is different so the sensations are different. When you play football as a professional there are a lot of people looking at you with huge expectations whereas here it's all about how I feel.\n\nIf I finish in three hours and 40 minutes this Sunday it will be fine but if I run faster or slower, that's fine too.\n\nQ. Real Madrid have nine wins in nine games, what have you made of the team at the start of the season?\n\nReally fantastic. But I don't just look at the development of the players, I also focus a lot on Carlo Ancelotti who has developed admirably as a coach.\n\nQ. Casemiro left and Aurelien Tchouameni arrived...\n\nI love this player because he is very young but he has a great personality and is playing very well. I have to admit that I had doubts because Casemiro was a very experienced player and both Tchouameni and Camavinga have little experience but they are handling the pressure of playing for Real Madrid admirably.\n\nQ. Can anyone argue with Karim Benzema for the Ballon d'Or this year?\n\nI think he is a strong favourite, although you can never say 100 percent that he will win it. Karim is now a very complete player and the award would be well deserved.\n\nKaká con la ropa oficial del Maratón de Berlín en el Adidas Sport Base de la capital alemana. Fotos: Vanessa Cortés\n\nQ. Is Neymar still the star of Brazil or do you think Vinicius can rival him for that throne?\n\nNeymar is going to be Brazil's leader in Qatar 2022 but it's very important that he has players like Vinicius by his side. In the 2018 World Cup, Ney was the absolute protagonist but now we have Vini, Raphinha, Richarlison, Antony... who are not young promises but really good players.\n\nVinicius, for example, is a star at Real Madrid and scored the goal in the last Champions League final. This takes a bit of pressure off Neymar, which is very favourable to our interests.\n\nQ. Rodrygo has grown exponentially as a footballer in the last year, what do you think of him?\n\nWell, he is phenomenal. It is still being discussed in Brazil if he should go to the World Cup and I am clear that he has to be on the list.\n\nI myself went to the World Cup when I was 20 years old and had not yet left Brazil, while he is already a star in Real Madrid. It's also an experience that will be very good for his professional growth.\n\nQ. What is your best memory of Real Madrid? I'm not talking about winning a trophy, I'm talking about a specific memory, a moment.\n\nIt may sound strange, but I remember the day that I left, because I spoke with Florentino and he told me that they saw me as a great professional who had done everything possible to achieve great results in Madrid, but injuries and the few minutes that the coach gave me did not allow it.\n\nThat was a great satisfaction because I felt that the doors of the club were open to me. That's why you'll never hear me speak badly of Real Madrid or Jose Mourinho. In fact, when I met Florentino at the Champions League final in Paris earlier this year, we embraced.\n\nQ. In your heart of hearts, what did you enjoy more this year, the Scudetto for AC Milan or LaLiga and Champions League for Real Madrid?\n\nThat's a good question. Milan returned to the limelight in Italy after many years and that was phenomenal but the final in Paris I experienced it live in Paris and to see Real Madrid win a Champions League in that way... The truth is that I can't make up my mind.\n\nQ. South America hasn't won a World Cup since Brazil in 2002, which you were part of. Can you or Argentina break that streak this year?\n\nI hope so, but European football is very good. We also have a handicap and that is that with the birth of the UEFA Nations League we can no longer play friendlies against the big teams of Europe and that makes us less competitive because in South America, Brazil wins almost every game.\n\nThat makes it more difficult to grow as a national team, although it's true that both teams are doing very well at the World Cup and have great players.\n\nI really like this Argentina team, they are very mature and have a great coach. In short, both Brazil and Argentina have a great chance of winning this World Cup.\n\nQ. Which teams can stand up to Brazil and Argentina in Qatar?\n\nAbove all France, who are the big rivals because they have fantastic players and are the reigning champions, although Spain and Germany are also great rivals.\n\nThen we have to keep an eye on Portugal, who have a good team, although we have to wait and see how Cristiano gets there. And then there's Belgium, of course, who usually fail in the end despite having a great team.\n\nQ. How do you see Luis Enrique's Spain, and is there a player you particularly like?\n\nSpain have a very good team with great players, even though they are very young.\n\nLuis Enrique seems to me to be a very creative coach and I like Gavi a lot. Pedri also has a bright future ahead of him although I have a special affection for Alvaro Morata because I saw him become a professional.",

    "‘Hidden genocide’: Death of Indigenous man in Brazil spurs outcry": "The death of a man believed to be the last member of an uncontacted Indigenous tribe in Brazil’s western Amazon has renewed calls for the Brazilian government to protect Indigenous communities from escalating violence and encroachment on their lands.\n\nInternational rights group Survival International reported on Sunday that the man known only as the “Man of the Hole” was found dead in Tanaru Indigenous Territory in the northwestern state of Rondonia. He died of apparent natural causes, according to the Brazilian authorities.\n\nThe man, whose name was derived from his habit of building deep holes, was the last surviving member of a tribe that saw its people “massacred in a series of attacks from the 1970s onwards” and had been living in total isolation for years, Survival International said.\n\nFiona Watson, the group’s research and advocacy director, said people knew very little about the man, including what he called himself, the name of his tribe, or what language he spoke.\n\n“All we know about him, from piecing the evidence together, is he was the sole survivor of several genocidal attacks,” she told Al Jazeera in an interview, describing him as a symbol of “a very hidden and secret genocide” as well as of “extraordinary courage and resilience”.\n\nNews of the man’s death prompted an outpouring of grief for many, while also placing a renewed focus on policies of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro’s government that Indigenous leaders and activists say are putting them at risk of attacks and forcing them off their territories.\n\n“The Indigenous territories are being invaded because people feel tremendous impunity, the invaders. With Bolsonaro … people feel very emboldened,” said Watson.\n\n“I think this is a wake-up call because … a very important part of rich human diversity is gone forever with the death of the Man of the Hole,” she added. “The Brazilian government has to treat this as an emergency and put funding and put experienced field staff, more staff, on the ground to determine exactly where these people are and to set about demarcating and protecting their land.”\n\n‘Intensified brutality’\n\nBrazil is home to more than 800,000 Indigenous people from over 300 distinct groups, according to data from the last census in 2010 cited by the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (APIB) rights group.\n\nFor years, Indigenous leaders have raised alarm over the threats their communities face in the South American nation, particularly in areas with little government oversight that farmers, miners, poachers and others are seeking to control and exploit.\n\nIndigenous people have accused Bolsonaro and his allies of adopting policies that seek to displace them in favour of the groups illegally encroaching on their territories, while loosening environmental protections in critical areas such as the Amazon rainforest. The far-right leader has supported more mining in the Amazon, saying it will stimulate the economy.\n\nThe Indigenous Missionary Council, a group affiliated with the National Conference of Bishops of Brazil, recorded 305 cases of “possessory invasions, illegal exploitation of resources and damage to property” on Indigenous territories last year, affecting 226 Indigenous lands in 22 Brazilian states. That is up from 109 such incidents in 2018, the year before Bolsonaro took office – a 180 percent increase.\n\n“In addition to the quantitative increase in cases and lands affected by illegal activities of miners, loggers, hunters, fishermen and land grabbers, among others, the invaders intensified their presence and brutality of their actions in Indigenous territories,” the council said in a report this month (PDF). “These violent and criminal attacks, often with heavy weapons, have been repeatedly reported by the Indigenous people and ignored by the federal government, which continued to stimulate mining activities in these territories.”\n\nIn August 2021, APIB filed a complaint asking the International Criminal Court to investigate Bolsonaro for “genocide” and “crimes against humanity” amid the deteriorating situation, accusing his government of publicly encouraging “the criminal invasion of traditional [Indigenous] territories”.\n\nThe state’s policies expose Indigenous peoples “to death threats, murder, invasions, destruction of their territories and contamination of resources”, the group said in a report (PDF) last year, while “Bolsonaro’s discourse is a major driver of those attacks”.\n\nLand protection\n\nIn a written statement to Al Jazeera, Brazil’s foreign affairs ministry said the government is committed “to protect the human rights of all Brazilians, including Indigenous peoples”. The country’s Indigenous affairs agency, known as FUNAI, invested $15.9m ($82.5m Brazilian real) for the “supervision of Indigenous lands” between 2019 and 2021, the ministry said in an email.\n\nFUNAI also uses satellite imagery to monitor illegal activities. “Such information enables FUNAI to assess unlawful occurrences on Indigenous lands and to plan actions of territorial protection, providing for a quick reaction,” the statement said.\n\nBut Andrea Carvalho, a senior research assistant at Human Rights Watch (HRW) in Brazil, said there has been a clear escalation of attacks on Indigenous people and their lands in recent years. “This is driven by disastrous policies related to the protection of the environment and Indigenous rights in Brazil,” she told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe Bolsonaro administration has weakened Brazilian environmental agencies and FUNAI, said Carvalho, explaining that one of the ways it has done this is by removing experienced civil servants from leadership positions. Now, more than 200 Indigenous territories in Brazil are awaiting demarcation, the legal protection of lands, she added.\n\n“Historically it does take a lot of time to conclude a demarcation, but this administration even during the election campaign in 2018 pledged not to designate Indigenous territories, and that pledge was delivered. Since Bolsonaro took office, Brazil hasn’t demarcated any new Indigenous territories,” Carvalho said.\n\n‘We keep fighting’\n\nSonia Guajajara, an Indigenous activist running to be a federal deputy in Brazil’s upcoming elections, told Al Jazeera that while Indigenous people have never been a priority for Brazilian governments, Bolsonaro’s administration is “avowedly anti-Indigenous”.\n\nAmid the worsening wave of attacks, Guajajara said the demarcation of Indigenous territories is critical. “It is essential that we have our constitutional right to land guaranteed, because only then will we be able to preserve our culture, our ways of living and our life,” she said in an email.\n\n“We keep fighting and resisting, which is why I and so many other [Indigenous people] are running for public office in these elections. We want to occupy the spaces of power.”\n\nBut as Bolsonaro faces off against former left-wing President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in October polls, Carvalho said Indigenous issues have been largely left out of the election campaign so far. “It’s now up to the candidates to tell voters, to tell Brazilians, how they are planning to actually protect Indigenous rights and how to strengthen federal agencies – and how they plan to dismantle the criminal networks that are driving environmental devastation,” she said.\n\nWatson at Survival International urged international pressure on Brazil to better protect Indigenous lands after the death of the “Man of the Hole”, who she said was only able to “carry on his way of life” due to the government’s protection of the Tanaru Indigenous Territory.\n\n“I think his story is the ultimate illustration of what can happen to Indigenous peoples if we don’t protect their lands,” she said.",
    "Brazil Is Suffering a Wave of Violence. It’s Bolsonaro’s Fault": "On Sept. 9, a rural worker was fatally stabbed during a political discussion with a supporter of Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s far-right President, in the midwestern state of Mato Grosso do Sul. A little over a month ago, in the southern state of Paraná, an armed bolsonarista invaded a children’s birthday party and executed the child’s father in front of his entire family. The images of the crime, recorded by a security camera, shocked the country.\n\nThere are also cases where violence was only avoided by luck, or a lack of opportunity. A few days ago, while campaigning in the street, myself and my colleague Ediane Maria of the Socialism and Liberty Party, were threatened by an armed man who declared himself a Bolsonaro supporter when we passed him a pamphlet from our election campaign. The incident took place in São Bernardo do Campo, a city in the state of São Paulo, and is already under investigation by the Public Electoral Ministry.\n\nThese episodes, scattered across Brazil, are nothing new: they are just the latest in an extensive list of acts of political violence engendered by President Bolsonaro and his aggressive rhetoric toward those who disagree with him.\n\nLong before reaching the presidency, Bolsonaro was already known in Brazil for his right-wing positions and for his ideological alignment with the military dictatorship installed by the 1964 coup that ousted the left-wing João Goulart, and which was backed by the U.S. government. Defending the shooting of left-wing opponents on the campaign trail in 2018 and saying in 2014 he “wouldn’t rape” a female colleague “because she didn’t deserve it” are just a couple examples that illustrate the authoritarian personality of Bolsonaro, an ex-soldier.\n\nAware of this history, Brazil’s economic elite still chose to back Bolsonaro in the 2018 elections, supporting the fraudulent arrest that year of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva that would bar him from the race. In doing so, they cleared the path for the election of a man that they thought they could control over the next four years.\n\nRead More: Lula Interview on Exile and His Bid for Brazilian Presidency\n\nBut since arriving in the Palácio do Planalto, Bolsonaro has only become more brazen in his authoritarian overreach. His aggressive and irresponsible speeches have escalated a climate of violence and encouraged millions of supporters across Brazil to violently confront those who disagree with them. In this climate, Lula, who has since been acquitted of the corruption charges and is Bolsonaro’s main rival in the upcoming October general elections, recently had to reinforce his security detail with snipers for a campaign rally, after identifying bolsonarista threats.\n\nAfter four years of attacks on our institutions and values, it doesn’t seem surprising that Bolsonaro now threatens Brazilian democracy itself. In this, he is the image of his idol, former U.S. President Donald Trump. More than just an inspiration, Trump is the ideological north star of Bolsonaro’s political movement. Bolsonaro has repeatedly questioned the reliability of our internationally praised electronic voting machines, and said that he will only accept the result of the elections if they are “clean”; in other words, if he wins.\n\nMore from TIME\n\nUnlike Trump, however, Bolsonaro commands backing from some sectors of the military, many members of which serve in the President’s administration. Few people still minimize the risk of a Bolsonaro coup, though some still believe his worrying statements are just a big bluff. I fear that Bolsonaro, once he is defeated at the ballot box as polls expect, will seek to rupture our democracy—and resort to violence to do so. The whole question is whether he will have enough support to carry it out. Today, by all indications, he wouldn’t. But that should not make us underestimate the risk.\n\nIn recent weeks, Bolsonaro’s allies in the Armed Forces have managed to force the Superior Electoral Court to allow them to do a “parallel inspection” of the electoral process, opening the door for them to question, within a weakened institutional framework, a vote against the President on Oct 2.\n\nAt the same time, Bolsonaro and his sons are doubling down on his strategy. They have intensified their links with criminal militias, according to Brazilian newspapers. (Bolsonaro denies any ties to militia groups.) And they have also called on the President’s supporters to arm themselves, to unite in the streets and resist defeat in a vote that Bolsonaro has tried to sow doubt over.\n\nRead More: What To Know About Brazil’s Crucial Election\n\nIf that happens, there is one thing that can ensure democracy and prevent violence: social mobilization in the streets. We would have to lead and redouble peaceful protests until Bolsonaro leaves the presidential palace.\n\nThe streets are also key, at this moment, to increasing Lula’s margin of victory that will make it harder for Bolsonaro to spread lies about the legitimacy of the vote. By talking face to face with undecided voters, we will fight for victory—victory for a democratic and anti-fascist country, where differences are resolved through dialogue and not with bullets.\n\nOnly then will we put Brazil back on a path of democracy and social justice. Only then will the Amazon and our biodiversity be safe from the ravages of deforestation. Only then will Brazil be respected and admired on the international scene again. There are only a couple weeks left for the most important elections in our country yet.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com.",
    "Brazil's meat regulation carnage": "A new law proposed by the Brazilian Government will end mandatory inspections of meat production which would result in a huge upsurge in extreme cruelty, chemical pollution and staff health and safety.\n\nDozens of animal advocacy organisations, conservationist groups and Brazilian senators have now joined together to voice collective concern over the Self-Control Bill from the Ministry of Agriculture.\n\nIf approved, the law will enable the government to withdraw all mandatory state inspections into the animal agriculture industry. Federal inspectors would supervise compliance by auditing company reports, with no on-site supervision required.\n\nPlates\n\nThe bill was put forward to increase the capacity of the animal agriculture sector to increase exports. But charities warn that animal welfare and sanitary standards “are at extremely serious risk” and that “already vulnerable farmed animals will be at increased risk of extreme violence and cruelty ”.\n\nAbigail Penny, executive director of Animal Equality UK, said: “This issue is far closer to home than you might first think.\n\n\"The UK imports tens of thousands of tonnes of animal products from Brazil every year and with such a disturbing lack of oversight there’s no way of knowing how those animals lived and died.\n\n\"The suffering they endured will forever be kept out of sight. Ultimately, if governments won’t protect them, we as consumers can, by leaving animals off of our plates.”\n\nThose companies that opt-in for inspections will be allowed to hire private inspectors or firms to supervise legal compliance.\n\nAgribusiness\n\nThis has raised alarms with members of the Association of Inspectors (ANFFA Sindical), who admit that it poses a conflict of interest, as private companies will not have the resources or power to counterbalance the interests of the large food businesses and, if they highlight failings, will be at risk of losing paying clients.\n\nThe bill would also allow for automatic approval of animal vaccines, antibiotics and anti-parasite medicines to be used on farms without commercial purposes, without the need for a formal assessment to first be carried out by government professionals and for a formal license of approval to be given.\n\nCampaigners say that the withdrawal of government inspections also means that the use of illegal agrochemicals cannot be easily identified and prevented, nor can those manufactured and sold at lower prices that are not approved by authorities and may cause serious public health problems.\n\nThe bill has already been approved in May 2022 in the Lower House of the Congress and sent to the Senate the same month. A public hearing was held in early June but only representatives of the agribusiness sector and the ANFFA Sindical-o were invited.\n\nCarla Lettieri, executive director of Animal Equality Brazil, said: “The bill is moving at such speed, it’s clearly being fast-tracked.\n\nAttack\n\n\"This bill is a blatant attack on the protections currently in place to protect animal welfare, our environment and human health. We will not sit back and watch as our laws are loosened. The only ones who would win is the animal agriculture industry, who will be left to self-police”.\n\nAnimal Equality Brazil has coordinated a number of actions to shed light on the potentially negative impacts of the bill, including sending letters to appeal for Senators to reconsider the Bill’s approval. Supporters include Greenpeace Brazil, Mercy for Animals and Instituto Brasileiro de Defesa do Consumidor (IDEC).\n\nThis latest joint action has successfully reverted the voting of the public consultation and now, with this increased public awareness, the number of Brazilian citizens voting against the Bill is greater than those in favour.\n\nAccording to the latest figures from the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board, in 2021 the UK imported £3.2 million worth of fresh beef and Brazilian imports made up nearly half of processed beef imports in 2021, the equivalent of £33.6 million of meat.\n\nThis Author\n\nBrendan Montague is the editor of The Ecologist.

    "Democratic institutional strength before and beyond elections: The case of Brazil": "Table of contents\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe case of Brazil: A young, yet resilient democracy\n\nA stronger democracy in the long run\n\nThe role of the United States and the international community\n\nConclusion\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nBrazil—Latin America’s largest economy and the fourth-largest democracy in the world—will elect its next president, governors, congress, and state-level assemblies in October 2022. This is one of the most momentous elections in recent years, a result of the inflection point that Brazil faces alongside concern about what may transpire on the day of the election and in the days afterward. This uncertainty, combined with global trends of declining democratic freedoms in recent years, suggests that in the aftermath of the October elections, Brazil has an opportunity to reinforce efforts to strengthen its institutions and recalibrate its democracy to meet domestic and global challenges. This issue brief compiles actionable recommendations for Brazil to do just that.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAt the 2022 Summit for Democracy, President Joe Biden noted that democratic backsliding is the “defining challenge of our time.”\n\nDemocracy, as a system of government, is ever evolving. However, democratic freedoms have been waning worldwide for the past sixteen years. In 2021, twice as many countries lost civil liberties and freedoms compared to those that improved them. Today, more than two-thirds of the world population lives in nondemocratic regimes, or in countries that have seen democratic backsliding in recent years.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden convenes a virtual summit with leaders from democratic nations at the State Department’s Summit for Democracy, at the White House, in Washington, U.S. December 9, 2021. REUTERS/Leah Millis\n\nThis trend also holds true in Latin America and the Caribbean. Authoritarian regimes in Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua have survived for years. Other countries in the region have seen a dramatic decline in civil liberties. According to 2021 data, half of the countries in Latin America and the Caribbean are experiencing some degree of democratic erosion.\n\nBrazil is no exception to these global trends. The October elections offer an opportunity to begin addressing concerns about the resilience of its democracy. From the state to the national level, Brazilians will have an opportunity to choose the future trajectory of their democracy. The challenges that Brazilian democracy has confronted in recent years—beginning with the massive demonstrations of 2013 and continuing through questioning of the democratic model among some sectors in recent years—suggest that, regardless of which parties and politicians are elected, Brazilians must prioritize strengthening their democratic institutions now, and in the years to come.\n\nThe case of Brazil: A young, yet resilient democracy\n\nAs the world undergoes a wave of democratic questioning, and even backsliding, Brazilians head to the polls as the country is at a crossroads, making it important to shift its gaze from the headlines of the day to thinking about longer-term solutions to the country’s political crisis.\n\nBrazil is a young democracy. It was not until 1989 that the country held its first direct presidential elections, after the end of the military dictatorship. Since then, Brazilian democracy has made great strides, establishing a well-regarded electoral system, overcoming hyperinflation and economic crises, and consolidating around a vibrant party system.\n\nThe October 2022 elections are a crucial test for Brazilian democracy. Although the elections will be another opportunity to see democracy in action, increasingly high levels of polarization and disinformation have contributed to extremist narratives, episodes of violence, and the questioning of democratic principles.\n\nWorkers from Electoral Court check performance of electronic voting urns in Curitiba, Brazil June 24, 2022. REUTERS/Rodolfo Buhrer\n\nThe Brazilian electoral process has been regarded as one of the fastest and most reliable in the world. But the turbulent run-up to the election has raised concerns that the transparency and fairness of democratic processes may be undermined, and that the resiliency of the electoral process and democratic institutions will be tested. Ensuring the integrity of this process, while also mitigating the risk of political violence, is imperative. Any action to further strengthen the resilience of Brazil’s democratic system is contingent upon an electoral process that fosters the proper function of institutions, and protects civil society and an independent media. This critical moment presents a unique opportunity for Brazil to further bolster its democratic system and public trust in its democracy in the years to come.\n\nOver the past generation, Brazilian democracy has fluctuated between moments of high confidence in the democratic system and periods of political and institutional crisis, in which the strength and resilience of its democracy were in doubt. In recent years, Brazilian democratic institutions have risen to the challenge of recalibrating their capabilities to face new challenges.\n\nThree examples illustrate their resilience. First, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Brazil was able to delay the electoral process and shift the date of municipal elections, all within the bounds of its constitution. Further, state and local governors adopted a variety of strategies to respond to the pandemic, with democratic federalism contributing to a panoply of experiments for addressing isolation and lockdown measures. Second, following antidemocratic protests in September 2021 that included messages threatening the Supreme Court and elections, a variety of representatives of democratic institutions (such as the Supreme Court, the House of Representatives, the Senate, civil-society organizations, and the media), came together to publicly condemn such proposals. The backlash forced President Jair Bolsonaro to change his tone and back down from his more extreme positions. Lastly, the manifestation of professors, jurists, students, civil-society representatives, business leaders, and former and current government officials, through a letter with more than nine hundred thousand signatories in favor of democracy in Brazil, is yet another example of the esteem for democratic principles and respect of civil liberties, especially when institutional credibility is questioned.\n\nDemonstrators take part in a protest for democracy and free elections and against Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro, at Paulista Avenue in Sao Paulo, Brazil, August 11, 2022. The sign reads “Democracy” REUTERS/Carla Carniel\n\nBrazilian institutions are already taking concrete steps to fortify their capabilities ahead of, and beyond, the upcoming electoral cycle. Such efforts are, and will continue to be, important to ensure a healthy democracy. But as we look ahead, even beyond the October elections, what mechanisms are needed to prevent backsliding and foster the resilience of democratic institutions and the strength of Brazilian democracy in the coming years?\n\nA stronger democracy in the long run\n\nIn July 2022, the Atlantic Council held individual consultations and convened a group of key Brazilian and international experts from civil-society organizations, the public and private sectors, academia, the press, and others to discuss concrete ways in which Brazil could further support its democratic system ahead of, and beyond, the upcoming elections. Below are actionable recommendations for next steps, including suggestions for the role the United States and the international community could play to support a prosperous Brazilian democracy in the long run.\n\nInstitutionalize unwritten democratic norms that ensure independence. In recent years, many unwritten democratic norms have been taken for granted and, in some cases, flaunted. One example is the nomination of the prosecutor general of the republic (PGR), the lead of the federal prosecutorial service (Ministério Público Federal, MPF). Constitutionally, the nomination of the PGR must follow a process that includes presidential nomination and approval by the Senate. Customarily, however, since 2003 the president selects a name from a list of three names chosen by prosecutors. The benefit of this so-called lista tríplice is that it ensures some coherence within the MPF, as well as ensuring that the prosecutor general is more independent from the other branches of government.\n\nTo reinforce checks and balances, institutionalizing such norms and consolidating the autonomy of institutions with political oversight is imperative. The practice of selecting the PGR via a lista tríplice guaranteed an initial layer of independence to the prosecutor general’s role. This was especially important because the MPF should remain autonomous given its oversight role, including in the electoral process. Thus, institutionalizing such norms would ensure the impartiality of the prosecutor general’s nomination and foster the autonomous role of the MPF within the political system, while also reaffirming the independence of the Brazilian judiciary and its prosecutors. Using the example of the lista tríplice for the MPF, instilling processes in other democratic organs—such as the Federal Police, the Federal Accountability Office (TCU), and the Comptroller General of Brazil (CGU)—could be internal mechanisms to guarantee checks and balances, and the appropriate indepence of these offices from established political forces and interested groups.\n\nAddress challenges for effective rule of law. To ensure a vibrant democracy, the rule of law must be effective. In Brazil, 17.6 people were killed daily by police forces in 2020, with such violence rarely leading to consequences. Data show that 28 percent of federal officeholders have been investigated or indicted for criminal behavior, while only a handful have been held accountable. In the case of the state of Rio de Janeiro, for example, members of militias and organized-crime groups also have ties to the political system. These data imply that strengthening the rule of law remains a key challenge. Better trainings for police forces to address abuses, reforms to oversight agencies to improve the accountability of Brazil’s judicial system, and fostering a lawfulness culture through the school system and civil-society activism could help ensure the effectiveness of the rule of law, while also targeting the younger generations as positive agents of change, and promoters of democracy and the rule of law.\n\nDepoliticization of the armed forces. The armed forces are a state institution responsible for protecting the sovereignty of the state, the order of the democratic system, and the safety of citizens, while also guaranteeing the ability of the three branches of government to properly function. As such, the armed forces must remain impartial in politics. In recent years, active military officials have taken civil positions within the Brazilian political system. As a way of example is Minister Eduardo Pazuello, a three-star general, as Minister of Health. Even in the constitution, deepening and solidifying the impartiality of the armed forces is imperative for the proper control of powers within the democratic system. Congress should take a more active role in ensuring this impartiality, as it began to do with a bill introduced in 2021 that aims to clarify the role of the armed forces and active military in the political system. It is critical for the military, the police, and members of any state institutions to refrain from any interference in political and political party-based activities—including, but not limited to, the elections.\n\nEnsure equitable political representation. There has been long-standing dissatisfaction with the lack of representativeness of the political system. Women represent more than 50 percent of the Brazilian population, yet account for only about 15 percent and 13 percent of representatives in the House and the Senate, respectively. The data are just as concerning for other groups. Ensuring better representation and equal participation in politics by women, indigenous communities, black Brazilians, and other marginalized groups would be a first step in having a better representation of Brazilian society at the decision-making table and, thus, more effective public policies to target their needs. More ambitious goals and affirmative action would help to move Brazil in that direction. However, enforcement is also imperative. Brazil has a gender quota requiring that women make up 30 percent of candidates for political parties. But lack of incentives for further engagement of women in politics, in addition to the high number of cases of violence against women in politics and structural imbalances, limit the potential for women’s equitable participation. New legislation that aims to punish violence against women in politics, in effect for the 2022 elections, is a first step in that direction. Civil society has an important contribution to make in monitoring and denouncing cases of violence against women in politics, including those happening virtually. In addition to monitoring, electoral agencies should follow through on the enforcement of this legislation. Establishing the means through which more women could take on leadership positions in political bodies and parties could help push Brazilian politics toward more realistic representation and actual participation.\n\nSafeguard a welcoming environment for a vibrant civil society. Among many actors in healthy and vibrant democracies, civil society and the media play key roles in ensuring a healthy public debate and a democratic political system. In Brazil, journalists and activists often face dangerous threats against their activities, and even their lives. Journalists Conrado Hubner and Patricia Campos Mello faced intimidation for criticizing political figures, while journalist Dom Phillips and activist Bruno Pereira were killed in 2022 during an excursion in the Brazilian Amazon, apparently for photographing illegal fishing in the area.\n\nIndigenous people attend a protest demanding justice for journalist Dom Phillips and indigenous expert Bruno Pereira, who were murdered in the Amazon, in Sao Paulo, Brazil June 23, 2022. REUTERS/Carla Carniel\n\nIn addition to further bolstering safeguards for press freedom, respect for and inclusion of perspectives from civil-society organizations, among other stakeholders, is imperative to promote effective public policies—and a democratic system that delivers to its citizens. Further cooperation among civil-society organizations, domestically and internationally, could boost the role and significance of these voices within Brazil. More coordinated efforts—from local associations to leading international civil-society organizations in country—would help promote a louder and more cohesive voice for civil society in Brazil. This was recently done through a letter with more than three thousand signatories, including former Supreme Court justices, actors, musicians, and even executives, expressing their support for democracy and trust in the Brazilian voting system. In addition, guaranteeing penalties for intimidation against civil-society representatives, as well as members of the media, is also imperative to safeguarding a prosperous environment for independent civil society and media.\n\nFurther strengthening institutional capabilities to manage the challenges of disinformation. Disinformation and misinformation are global challenges. As such, Brazil’s Electoral Supreme Court (TSE, in Portuguese) has prioritized disinformation as a challenge to the electoral processes in 2022 and beyond. Brazilian institutions, civil-society organizations, fact-checking bodies, and news outlets should work together to mitigate impact and risks. Based on the developments that unfolded after the US elections in 2020—including, but not limited to, January 6—as well as the role that disinformation played in Brazilian elections in 2018 and 2020, TSE established partnerships with social media and messaging platforms, creating a united front to mitigate risks and raise awareness to the known challenge of disinformation. This is a proactive initiative to promote and endure the credibility of electoral bodies. To go one step forward, Brazilian news outlets could use already-established COVID-19 data-gathering strategies and go directly to local and state governments to identify disinformation and its sources. This strategy could facilitate and speed up the work of fact-checking institutions in explaining disinformation, of the media (and TSE itself) in countering and spreading it, and of social media platforms in removing it, as appropriate. Overall, having a more coordinated civil society and safeguarding an independent media will result in greater checks against authoritarian tendencies.\n\nRe-establish trust in the political system and foster civic engagement beyond electoral cycles. In recent history, corruption cases among politicians, disinformation, misinformation, and other factors have exacerbated distrust in political institutions in Brazil. Polarization has also deepened political and social divides. Regaining confidence in the democratic system is an uphill battle. However, in the long run, revigorated trust in the political system is imperative to foster civic engagement beyond electoral cycles. As a fundamental principle of democracy, broad and active civic engagement is essential to fortify an established and well-functioning democracy in Brazil. This educational effort must begin in schools, to educate the next generations to be active and engaged citizens, and to tackle the question of what democracy means.\n\n17-year-old Vitoria Rodrigues de Oliveira takes a photo of a young woman to register her to vote for Brazil’s upcoming elections in Sao Joao de Meriti in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil April 5, 2022. Picture taken April 5, 2022. REUTERS/Pilar Olivares\n\nBut developing a comprehensive awareness-raising campaign—led by government agencies, in coordination with civil-society organizations and other key actors—could be a first step in the right direction to clarify the roles and responsibilities of elected officials and other public figures, as well as individuals’ rights and duties. In a country where voting is mandatory (with a few exceptions), society must have the tools to make well-informed decisions about its political representatives. Most importantly, only a well-educated society with access to transparent and accurate information, and comprehension of the political game, can hold politicians and democratic institutions accountable.\n\nThe role of the United States and the international community\n\nSupport immediate recognition of results and quick confirmation of the legitimacy of the electoral process. Given Brazil’s electronic-voting system, electoral results are determined and announced on the same day elections are held. The agility of the system and the seal of credibility given by international recognition curbs potential unrest in the expectation of results. As such, the international community, represented by individual countries and international organizations, must be able to recognize the legitimacy of results immediately after their announcement.\n\nContinuing the long tradition of welcoming international electoral-observation missions, the upcoming elections will include missions from the Organization of American States, Mercosur’s Parliament, and the Inter-American Union of Electoral Organizations (Uniore). These missions should aim to release their verdicts on the freedom and fairness of the electoral process quickly, ideally no more than forty-eight hours following Election Day. Beyond the electoral cycle, countries should be explicit in recognizing the historical respect of Brazil toward its democratic system and principles, as well as efforts to improve their capabilities. The United States, for example, recently endorsed trust in the Brazilian electoral system, following questions about the legitimacy of this process.\n\nEstablish a US-Brazil high-level dialogue on democracy promotion. In the context of recent commitments made by both the United States and Brazil on the occasion of the Summit for Democracy, both countries restarted the US-Brazil Human Rights Working Group. This is one step forward in both countries’ efforts to strengthen their own democracies and promote the principles of a rules-based order globally. Given similarities and the strong, historic partnership between the United States and Brazil, both countries could benefit from a more direct dialogue in terms of best practices and lessons learned with regard to common challenges to democracy, and potential common solutions. More broadly, high-level cooperation on this front would safeguard principles of a rules-based democratic order, in addition to deepening the bilateral relationship and fostering similar practices across the hemisphere. Within this framework, further cooperation with the US Department of State, and even the US Departments of Justice and Defense, could help move the needle forward, while also including civil-society and private-sector representatives from both countries.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe next Brazilian government will face a critical moment to strengthen the country’s democracy and its institutions to prove effective in addressing citizens’ needs, especially in challenging times both economically and socially. A key ingredient for democratic crisis is the growing belief that democratic government does not serve citizens’ needs. Addressing this issue and rebuilding trust in the political system are vital for long-term domestic stability in Brazil.\n\nThis issue brief aimed to suggest a path forward to begin this task.\n\nBeyond Brazil itself, the country’s democracy is a bellwether for democratic health in the Western Hemisphere. The polarization, concerns of electoral violence, marginalization of minority voices, and other patterns occurring in Brazil must be addressed and condemned. Only through systemic analysis and prevention can all stakeholders work to guarantee democratic health presently, and in the years to come.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nMany of the ideas in this spotlight were informed by a July 27 strategy session organized by the Atlantic Council, which featured the participation of key Brazilian and international experts from civil-society organizations, the public and private sectors, academia, the press, and others.

    "Brazil: The Most African Country In The World Outside Africa – African Markets": "Exclusive African Markets Interview by Mr. Ambassador, Francisco Luz, Consul General of Brazil in Nigeria.\n\nBrazil: The most African country in the world, outside of Africa.\n\nBrazil is the most African country in the world that is not in Africa. Controversial statement, isn't it? However, according to Mr. Ambassador Francisco Luz, so it is.\n\nIn this seventh Great Interview, we got to know Francisco Luz, a born conversationalist with an exceptional African culture and we had a very pleasant time during the interview.\n\nNot only did we get to know his fabulous journey, but we also got to know the African continent better, seen through the eyes of someone who comes from outside, but who has a great love for the continent. We understand how the media transform such a diverse continent into a reductive common stereotype, treating Africa as if it were a “mere country”.\n\nWe got to know the influence of the Yoruba in Brazil and the historical connections that Brazil and the Kingdom of Benin have shared since 1770, but not only. We realized how Brazil is dependent on Agricultural Urea and how the commercial exchange between Brazil and Nigeria is so important.\n\nAnyway, it was an enlightening conversation, on these and other subjects, worth seeing/reading. So don't waste time and watch this very interesting interview on our YouTube Channel, +Africa, or if you prefer, read the full interview here.\n\nThe interview\n\nAfrican Markets (BAD): Good afternoon Mr Ambassador Francisco Cruz, it is a pleasure to be here with you. To start this interview and for our listeners to get to know you a little better, can you tell us who you are, what are your current roles and also tell us a little about your journey to the present day?\n\nFrancisco Luz (FL): Good afternoon Francisco, it's a pleasure to be here on the African markets channel. I have been a career diplomat at Itamaraty for 39 years. I started my career in technical cooperation in Brazil, then I went to Argentina, to the Embassy in Buenos Aires, then to our Embassy in Cuba, in Havana, from there I returned to Brazil.\n\nI worked in the area of ​​communications and administration and then returned abroad, to the Brazilian embassy in Washington. From there, I went to Pretoria, South Africa, to the Embassy in Maputo, where I was Minister Counselor. Then my first post as ambassador to Africa was in Tanzania, where I also took care of Seychelles, Comoros and was the representative of Brazil in the East African community.\n\nI stayed there for six years, then moved to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and stayed four years and four months in Amman and, since October 2019, I have been here in Lagos as Consul General of Brazil in this city.\n\n(BAD): Mr. Ambassador, at this time Mr. you are the Consul General of Brazil in Lagos, Nigeria, but you have held other positions in Africa, more precisely in South Africa, Mozambique and Tanzania, as you have just reported. On your journey through these countries, did you find many differences between them or can we say that there is a common African identity?\n\n(FL): It was a total of 18 years that I complete now on the 18th of October, I complete 18 years in Africa and look, I can say that nothing is further from the stereotype that Africa is a unique thing, than the reality that I saw in these 18 years. years, across the 27 countries I visited. The continent is very diverse, both in terms of population, language, religion, cultural background, even geography.\n\nEvery corner surprises you in a positive way, you have countries that are subtropical and of an impressive beauty like Swaziland, today Eswatini and Mozambique, the Indian coast has beautiful beaches, in Tanzania in Kenya and Mozambique, the island of Bazaruto, Zanzibar, Mafia Island are spectacular places and the savannah, nature, national parks, is a very, very beautiful region with a lot of diversity.\n\nWhat we see is the stereotype that we have and that is transmitted by the media, it is the stereotype that I am feeling, it is the reality that I live here, Nigeria concentrates, practically all these stereotypes of an Africa with problems, of a Rich Africa, Lagos, Nigeria is the continent's largest economy and the city of Lagos has the eighth GDP in Africa.\n\nSo there is a lot of wealth and at the same time a lot of poverty, a lot of problems, everything that we see in the media. But that's not all, the continent is very complex and in my view it is the continent of the Future, it is the only continent that will show growth and that has the capacity to feed the world in the future.\n\n(BAD): In fact, I agree with you about these stereotypes that are made about Africa and it is curious to see that one of the most common stereotypes in Africa is cultural. And this stereotype is due a lot, interestingly, there is a region where it is at this moment or part of it that has to do with the Yoruba, since the Yoruba are the largest ethnic-linguistic group in West Africa and one of the largest in Africa.\n\nIts influence in Brazil is extremely strong, Yoruba culture not only gave rise to Candomblé in Brazil, but also, in 2018, Rio de Janeiro was the first to recognize Yoruba as intangible heritage. Is it fair to say that Brazil is the closest non-African country to Africa?\n\n(FL): Look, Francisco, I have no doubt about that, my experience here is really, it's very interesting and intense in these ties and that generates a soft power huge for Brazil here in Nigeria, because we feel at home, they feel very comfortable with Brazilians, they love to travel to Brazil and we have been working to try to bring that closer.\n\nNot only, through greater knowledge, of putting the Organizations that represent the Yoruba community in Brazil, in contact with institutions here in Nigeria, but trying to make co-productions of films, television programs, musical collaborations, theatrical collaborations, in any activity art that brings these two cultures closer together.\n\nYou mentioned Rio de Janeiro but that's not all, Salvador is considered the Yoruba capital of the Americas and Salvador has also made the Yoruba language the official language of the city and is taught in the city's public schools, so these are types of initiatives that bring these closest societies.\n\nThe other day, at our September 7th event, I not only received the Ooni of Ife who is the religious leader of the entire Yoruba nation, but I also received about a dozen Reis or representatives of Reis, such as the King of Benin who was the third head of state to recognize Brazil's independence, on July 20, 1824, even before Portugal and the United Kingdom recognized it.\n\nHe was only surpassed by Argentina and the United States who recognized before him and he not only recognized, but appointed an ambassador and that Ambassador represented the kingdom of Benin and 13 other kingdoms that paid allegiance to King Osemwende at that time.\n\nThese relationships even predate Independence, the King of Onim, which is today the region of Lagos, already had the first Ambassador that he sent to Brazil, it was in 1770 when a representative of his arrived in Salvador, then capital of the colony and he represented the interests of the kingdom of Onim with the Brazilian colony.\n\nSo, these are very strong historical, cultural relationships, with influences on our cuisine, our culture, our music, our way of being, the national identity of Brazilians and I believe that today in Brazil, at least 20 million people could seek their ancestral ties in this region of Africa.\n\n(BAD): Mr. Ambassador, interestingly, when we started this series of interviews, the first one was with Cleber Guarani who is the president of CIITTA who is behind the project, Brazil-Nigeria Green Imperative, a project that aims to boost agricultural mechanization and livestock improvement in Nigeria , increasing the country's food security.\n\nThis project, which started a few years ago, will bring many benefits to both Nigeria and Brazil. What is your assessment of this project and what results do you think this project can achieve?\n\n(FL): Look, the Green Imperative initiative, I consider it to be the main Brazilian initiative in the area of ​​agriculture worldwide. It's a $1.1 billion, five-year project. It started to be traded seven years ago. In 2019, the agreement was finally signed and now, three years later, all the documentation was finally signed earlier this year.\n\nThe congress here took a year to study it, the Ministry of Agriculture took a year to create the internal infrastructure to absorb the technology that will be transferred by CIITTA, as Cléber Guarani mentioned there. Now, on the 8th, we held the Brazil-Africa Business Forum here in Lagos, we had the entire morning module dedicated to agriculture.\n\nCléber had the opportunity to present our agricultural potential and the potential for technology transfer in this area and we had the physical presence of the Nigerian government's focal point for the initiative, Dr. Andrew Kwasari who is the special adviser to the Vice President of the Republic for agriculture.\n\nThe debate started to get so intense that we had to cancel some presentations for us to conclude, because of the great interest that this issue of Agriculture generated in the audience.\n\nI think that Brazil's focus, first of all, is this situation that we are experiencing today, with so many challenges that brought us, a pandemic, followed by a conflict in Europe, in countries that had great influence on the world's food energy security. , I think this brought possibilities for Brazil and for the African continent that we cannot fail to take advantage of.\n\nWe have to, somehow, cooperate as much as possible, so that Brazil and Nigeria, as the largest economy in Africa, we are one of the main factors of food and energy security in the world and I believe that the Green Imperative, be the main objective.\n\nIt's just that, 30 years after our agricultural revolution, our Green revolution, we have the ability to transfer to the continent a technology that is much more suitable for the reality of these countries, mainly here, because we have the same climate and the same geography. the same cultures.\n\nThe objective is for Brazil, not to continue exporting sugar, rice, cotton, meat, chicken, dairy products, to these countries, is for these countries to have our technology, we prefer to sell the machines and transfer the technology and work together to ensure the world's food security.\n\n(BAD): Continuing, in a way, in agriculture, here is an interesting topic, in my opinion, which is the issue of the Dangote agricultural urea plant, which recently started operating in March and has already made a profit of 130%, much of it obtained through sales to Brazil.\n\nAnd it is not the only company in this situation, we also have Indorama, we have Notore, that is, what I see is that the Brazilian market absorbs a lot of this Nigerian urea. Can you explain to me the importance of Nigerian urea for Brazil?\n\n(FL): Look at Nigeria since 2015, it had been exporting urea to Brazil, but in very small amounts, 10, 15, 30 million dollars, it had been the best year. Brazil is a country very dependent on these agricultural inputs, our consumption is the second largest in the world and we import 6 million tons of urea per year.\n\nAnd with that, with the crisis in Russia, which was our second largest supplier, this opportunity opened up for Nigeria to occupy this space. It is much closer to logistics, it is much easier and the existence of the Dangote project that, despite having been officially opened in March, had already been producing and exporting to Brazil since October.\n\nSo, last year they already exported 200 million dollars in urea to Brazil and Brazilian companies, even before the conflict in Eastern Europe, had already started. I started to receive inquiries since July of last year, for urea export.\n\nI don't know if they already felt that this crisis could occur, but I think that, for the simple fact of the entry into production of a unit of one and a half million tons, it would pave the way for another customer and that it would help to reduce the price in the Global Market .\n\nThat's not what happened. Nigerian urea is the most expensive for us, but it's the only one available, and with that, trade statistics have skyrocketed. In 2020, we had a trade just over a billion. Bilateral trade last year, we hit almost two billion and this year, this August alone, we have already reached 1 billion and 800, with 600 million exports of urea to Brazil.\n\nBrazil currently buys 60% of production, not only from Dangote, but also from Notore, Indorama and a smaller company called Golden Resource.\n\nSo it's a market and why is this important? First, there was already logistics, the ships that bring sugar from Brazil were returning empty, then the cargo ships, the company means Dangote is the main buyer of sugar and is now the main exporter and they use their own logistics, which reduced freight significantly and increases their profit.\n\nWe are now returning to our historic 30-year deficit with Nigeria. We had a year of surplus with Nigeria and our trade peaked at over 11 billion dollars and this year it should close, keeping the average export in the first eight months, we should be very close to 2 billion and half a dollar in trade with a surplus in favor of Nigeria over a billion.\n\n(BAD): Mr. Ambassador, to end this part of the interview I would like to ask one last question on a complex topic. Economic growth in Nigeria is being done exponentially, however social development is apparently not keeping pace with this development. Is this really a reality? And if so, what do you think could be done to reverse this trend?\n\n(FL): Look unfortunately it is. The growth today, the last quarter data, surprised economists, the growth was 3,6%. Unfortunately the country has structural problems in which a growth of 3,6% unfortunately does not reduce poverty, it simply maintains the level of wealth because the population growth is very high.\n\nSo much so that they passed Brazil last year. At the beginning of this year, in terms of population, they are already the sixth largest population in the world and they say that in 20 years they will even pass the United States and become the third most populous country in the world.\n\nAt this rate of growth, the economy would need to grow at the Chinese level of the past decade, 10% a year, in order to start lifting people out of poverty. Obviously, there is already a small growth in the middle class, there is already a demand for international tourism that did not exist years ago, it was only the elite that traveled, now, you can already see,\n\nWith the pandemic and the economic crisis, since 2008, Nigeria has maintained this growth above 3%. But thanks, not to the basic sector of the economy, which was oil, it was due to the growth of the services sector, basically and, now, more recently, with the fertilizers area, that is to say, the Industrial sector has also been giving a very large collaboration, but it is the service sector that has grown.\n\nNigeria has taken advantage of opportunities and, for example, Africa has seven unicorn companies, seven companies that in less than five years have reached a market value of over billion dollars, five are in Nigeria, four here in Lagos.\n\nIt is for you to see that the potential dynamism of the economy in terms of entrepreneurship is very high and the simple size of the market, which will reach 400 million people in 2050, will make this here, this country, one of the main engines of world growth.\n\nBig companies will have to start paying attention to Nigeria. It's no wonder that Microsoft has just opened the first software development center here, with 500 Engineers in a state-of-the-art building. Google brought Cabo Equiano, to stop here in Lagos.\n\nThe American consulate that is being built here in Lagos will be the largest in the world, at a cost of 560 million dollars, and it will be the focal point for the entrance of the US government's Intranet to the entire African continent, so I mean this sector. technology services, the banking sector, the start-up sector, including Agritex, this has shown very strong growth.\n\nNigeria currently has 5 start-ups, which is 10 times more than Kenya, which has 500, and if you add South Africa and everyone at the same level, South Africa, Egypt and whoever owns 500 start-ups , you add them all together, the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, it doesn't actually give the number of start-ups that exist here in the Nigerian market today.\n\nSo that demonstrates the dynamism and demonstrates what this segment of the new economy is all about. And also from the creative economy, few people realize that Nollywood, today is the second largest content launch platform in the world and is not second after Hollywood, it is second after Bollywood.\n\nHollywood has already been overtaken by Nollywood, which produces more than 800 films a year and dominates the market on platforms, such as DStv, which reaches not only the African continent, but also the Middle East.\n\nSo it's something that Brazilian businessmen need to wake up to the reality of the African continent, not thinking about now, they have to think about 2030 onwards. The reality today is hard, it is difficult, it is not easy to do business here, but it is necessary to have perseverance and understand the market and set up your strategies.\n\nAnyone who doesn't set foot now will have a hard time getting into 2030, when this is one of the biggest expanding markets in the world. They are one of the things we discuss most with entrepreneurs when they come to us to talk about Africa.\n\nThat was the focus, that was the message that I tried to convey at the event on the 8th, which was the first Business Forum held here in Lagos, in the last 10 years, between Brazilian and Nigerian entrepreneurs and I was fortunate to have the physical presence of FIRJAN (Federation of Industries of Rio de Janeiro), with four people, from Positivo BGH, Embraer and other smaller entrepreneurs in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n(BAD): In fact, Africa is going to be the future, we are seeing this exponential growth, not just in Nigeria. We are seeing, for example, South Africa becoming the new silicon valley, we are seeing other African countries emerging and growing in a way that I think the rest of the world has not yet noticed.\n\nEven at the level of new energies. To mean. Africa currently has the countries that pollute the least, it is the continent that pollutes the least and is the one that grows the most in terms of renewable energy.\n\nTherefore, it will in fact be the continent of the future and I think the rest of the world is not prepared for this because Africa always comes like the poor people who were our colonized, they are the poor poor people, they are nobody and, suddenly, they go come across this and they won't know where it's going to come from. And it's a fact that anyone who doesn't take the boat now will be left behind, there's no doubt about that.\n\n(FL): In fact, Francisco, what I see, at least that's my point of view, Africa is very diverse and the information that arrives is sometimes not true or reliable information, the continent is huge, we are talking about 54 countries and only four or five information arrive.\n\nThose who take time to change will not be able to take advantage of all the possibilities in the future. It is very important to have a strategy for the future, the Chinese have already seen this, the Turks have already seen this, the Koreans have already seen this, everyone has a strategy for 10 years from now, our entrepreneurs need to wake up and really start looking at the future. continent with more interest, focusing more on possibilities than challenges.\n\n(BAD): I think it's a matter of positioning too, Mr. Ambassador, it starts with a government strategy, perhaps with an alliance with all embassies and bilateral information.\n\n(FL): Yes, because we have to see the source. For example, if you get data from sources that deal with humanitarian aid, it's obvious that they'll want to take it easy, to even make it easier for donors to put a lot of money, but that's not it, we have to bring our private sectors closer, the people who produce, people who buy, for them to see that there is potential.\n\nI think the businessmen who came here were very surprised by the city. Obviously it's a monstrous city, it has a lot of problems, but it also has things that you wouldn't believe exist, some modernist buildings, very modern structures, the banking system that works over the phone, I make all payments over the phone, so it's a modern economy and everyone connected.\n\nPeople have no idea about this, it's a shame, we have to carry out more promotion and dissemination actions so that people really get to know the continent. You can only break this narrative with knowledge with information.\n\n(BAD): Mr. Ambassador on our part is everything, thank you very much for the time you have given us and, who knows, until next time.\n\nAuthor Francisco Lopes-Santos, OLY A former Olympic athlete, he has a PhD in Anthropology of Art and two Masters, one in High Performance Training and the other in Fine Arts.

    "What Could Brazil’s Post-Bolsonaro Climate Policy Look Like?": "If you would like to receive Latin America Brief in your inbox every Friday, please sign up here .\n\nThe highlights this week: Brazilians debate how to move forward with climate policy if President Jair Bolsonaro leaves office, Caribbean nations weigh leaving the Commonwealth, and an ancient Mexican snack gains new appeal.\n\nWelcome back to Foreign Policy’s Latin America Brief.\n\nThe highlights this week: Brazilians debate how to move forward with climate policy if President Jair Bolsonaro leaves office, Caribbean nations weigh leaving the Commonwealth, and an ancient Mexican snack gains new appeal.\n\nIf you would like to receive Latin America Brief in your inbox every Friday, please sign up here.\n\nA Climate Power Once More?\n\nUnder Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, deforestation—Brazil’s leading contributor to greenhouse gas emissions—has soared to a 15-year high in the Amazon region. His turn away from protecting the rainforest has been so detrimental to global climate goals that it has even led the country to be ostracized in some Western diplomatic and economic forums. The European Union froze trade talks with South American countries over deforestation concerns early in Bolsonaro’s term, and just this week, EU lawmakers voted to ban the import of merchandise linked to deforestation around the world.\n\nIf Bolsonaro is reelected next month, Brazil can expect these trends to continue apace. If, however, polls prove correct and former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva wins, the country may see a climate policy overhaul. Internationally, Brazil should “play in a position of leadership” on climate, Lula tweeted last month.\n\nDuring Lula’s two terms as president from 2003 to 2010, Brazil reduced its deforestation rate in the Amazon by over 70 percent. With its strong environmental credentials, the Lula government also helped push for wealthy countries to fund climate mitigation and adaptation efforts in poorer ones at the United Nations. In 2008, Germany and Norway created a fund with the Brazilian government to assist with Amazon conservation efforts; the two countries had paid Brazil over $1.2 billion through the fund before they froze their contributions over Bolsonaro’s environmental record in 2019.\n\nBut reinstating Brazil’s conservation credentials will be harder than simply swapping out leaders. Most deforestation in the country’s Amazon is illegal and conducted by a mix of actors including agriculture firms and small-scale loggers and farmers. As a result, any effective conservation effort depends on both offering economic alternatives to would-be deforesters and bolstering enforcement mechanisms to stop illegal logging and tree-burning.\n\nAnti-conservation forces currently hold significant sway over Brazilian politics. Right-wing and agribusiness-friendly lawmakers comprise large blocs in Brazil’s National Congress and are spending big ahead of next month’s election. Outside of government, illegal loggers have been emboldened by Bolsonaro’s rhetoric, and many are armed, Henrique Bezerra of Interface Environmental Advocacy told Foreign Policy.\n\nUntil recently, Lula’s campaign had publicized few detailed conservation plans. Some activists have also voiced concerns about his sustainability pledges, as Lula’s party weakened some of its environmental policies under his successor, Dilma Rousseff. Her government granted large-scale amnesty for past deforestation in 2012 and evicted at least 20,000 people to build a controversial hydroelectric dam in the Amazon that was completed in 2015—continuing Lula’s pattern of pressing forward with such dam projects despite environmental concerns.\n\nIn June, Lula released a platform pledging to combat environmental crimes, such as illegal logging; work toward net-zero deforestation; and meet Brazil’s emissions-reduction targets as set out in the Paris Agreement. He voiced support for the idea of an energy transition but also pledged to expand drilling and refining by Brazil’s national oil company to maintain what he called “energy security.”\n\nThis week, Lula embraced a host of new green pledges. On Monday, former Environment Minister Marina Silva—who resigned from the position in 2008 after clashes with Lula over a new hydroelectric dam permitting process—announced she would endorse Lula’s candidacy after he committed to over 20 policies she proposed. They include the introduction of carbon pricing, issuing new financial incentives for sustainable farming, and creating a so-called National Climate Change Authority to ensure all public policies adhere to Brazil’s Paris Agreement targets. O Globo reported that the creation of the body was Silva’s top priority. As for whether Lula would keep his promises, she said, “It was a public commitment made in front of everyone.”\n\nThe reunion between Marina and Lula energized activists. “Marina Silva makes me cry with hope,” tweeted former federal environmental official Natalie Unterstell.\n\nSpeaking to O Globo, Marina said she decided to move forward with her endorsement not only due to Lula’s environmental commitments but also to create a broad front against Bolsonaro. In recent weeks, the president—whom Marina called “the threat of threats”—has inched up in polls. Pollster Datafolha calculates he moved from an 18-point lag behind Lula in late July to an 11- point lag last week.\n\nAs Lula continues to formulate his potential climate policies, advocates have worked to develop policies of their own in the hope of influencing the next government. Unterstell, for her part, helped oversee the creation of a 10-part plan for decarbonizing Brazil’s economy that was created by consulting more than 100 policy experts. They estimate the plan would create at least 250,000 new green jobs in areas such as recycling and managing a carbon market.\n\nMeanwhile, a coalition of over 230 activist groups and nongovernmental organizations named Amazon on Its Feet is collecting signatures to propose a new forest protection law in Brazil’s National Congress. Once a threshold of 1.5 million signatures is reached, the law would move through Brazil’s Chamber of Deputies like any other. Only four so-called popular initiative measures have ever become law in Brazil, but campaign coordinator Karina Penha told Foreign Policy that the lengthy process is worth it.\n\n“We are betting on popular mobilization,” she said. And during election time, it’s all the more important “so that politicians understand this is an urgent issue.”\n\nThe Week Ahead\n\nSaturday, Sept. 24: Brazil holds a televised presidential debate.\n\nMonday, Sept. 26: The U.N. Human Rights Council discusses Venezuela.\n\nSunday, Oct. 2: Brazilians vote in general elections.\n\nWhat We’re Following\n\nDeal-making in Mexico. A high-level U.S. delegation that included U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Mexico City this week at Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s request. Although a multibillion-dollar trade dispute currently looms large over relations between the two countries, participants in the meeting struck a friendly tone, and U.S. officials said that planned investments in domestic manufacturing could offer spillover benefits to Mexican suppliers.\n\nAfterward, Reuters reported that U.S. officials had pressed Mexico to accept more migrants from Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, whom the United States is turning away at its borders under Title 42, a controversial Trump-era rule that enables the United States to effectively remove migrants’ right to seek asylum.\n\nFertilizer trails. While Russia’s war in Ukraine has politicized access to natural gas in Europe, the same could be said of fertilizer in Latin America, analyst James Bosworth points out in the Latin America Risk Report. Russia is one of the world’s leading fertilizer producers, and its global price has shot up since February. “Latin America should be rethinking its dependency on fertilizer from Russia and elsewhere outside the hemisphere,” Bosworth wrote.\n\nIn Brazil, dependence on Russian fertilizer is part of why Bolsonaro has refrained from criticizing the Kremlin. In Colombia, access to fertilizer is a driving issue amid the country’s reestablishment of relations with oil-rich Venezuela. In Peru, which imports much of its fertilizers from Russia, President Pedro Castillo’s high subsidies for fertilizers could help keep his popularity high despite repeated scandals.\n\nA toast of chapulines (meaning grasshoppers) with goat cheese, pork cracklings, radish, tomato, onion, and avocado is pictured at Mexican chef Alejandro Ruiz’s Guzina Oaxaca restaurant in Mexico City on Sept. 22, 2016.\n\nNew gourmet. In southern Mexico, street vendors have long sold fried grasshoppers, known as chapulines, as a crunchy, tangy snack. As eaters both in and out of the country look for beef alternatives, chapulines’ appeal has grown. Mexico’s government has even begun to study how to regulate the market, the Los Angeles Times reported last week.\n\nOften served as a guacamole topping, chapulines are now appearing at fine restaurants and even as a hamburger meat substitute. Although they are experiencing a boom today, the culinary tradition comes from precolonial times and was enjoyed by the Indigenous Aztecs.\n\nPerhaps counterintuitively, the bugs are not cheap. They require harvesting using special nets, and different times of year are ideal for catching different ages of the bugs, author María Ítaka writes for Culinary Backstreets. “Chapulines are for tacos or tostadas what grated parmesan is for pasta; they upgrade any dish with their herby and slightly acidic aftertaste.”\n\nQuestion of the Week\n\nBrazil is home to the majority of the Amazon biome. What country is home to the second-largest portion? Colombia Bolivia Ecuador Peru Amid a string of political turbulence in Peru, deforestation levels in the country hit six historical highs in the past 10 years, according to University of Maryland data.\n\nFP’s Most Read This Week\n\n• Putin Has a New Opposition—and It’s Furious at Defeat in Ukraine by Alexey Kovalev\n\n• Russia Is Supplying Ukraine With Lightly Used Tanks by Jack Detsch\n\n• A Ukrainian Victory Would Liberate Eastern Europe by Brian Whitmore\n\nIn Focus: Quitting the Crown A woman holds a sign in protest as she waits for the arrival of Britain’s Prince William and Catherine, Princess of Wales, on the seventh day of their tour of the Caribbean in Nassau, Bahamas, on March 25.\n\nLast year, Barbados turned heads by removing Queen Elizabeth II as its official head of state. It was the first former British colony and member of the Commonwealth of Nations to take this step since 1992. Meanwhile, other former colonies in the Caribbean have created committees tasked with demanding reparations from London for slavery and colonization.\n\nThose efforts were energized further last week after Elizabeth’s death. The monarch’s passing comes “amid increasing calls for the United Kingdom to reckon with its colonial history and as republican sentiment gains traction among countries in the Caribbean,” FP’s Amy Mackinnon reported.\n\n“Most people didn’t understand we were independent yet we have the queen as head of state,” Jamaican reparations and republicanism advocate Rosalea Hamilton told the Miami Herald. “We’re being told about protocols we now have to follow to transition from a queen to a king; the mourning period … all of this is new to Jamaica. And it is now raising more discussions about this transition.”\n\nBack in June, Marlene Malahoo Forte, Jamaica’s minister of legal and constitutional affairs, said officials were working to transition the country toward being a republic by 2025. And in Belize, a constitutional reform commission is set to consider whether the nation should do the same.\n\nIn the past few days, more announcements followed suit. Last Friday, the prime minister of the Bahamas said a referendum on the country becoming a republic was “always” on the table. On Saturday, Antigua and Barbuda’s prime minister said he plans to hold a referendum on casting off the British monarchy within three years.\n\nThe Caribbean was a key proving ground for the British imperial strategy of enrichment through chattel slavery in the 17th through 19th centuries, FP’s Howard French wrote this week.\n\n“Given the immensity of the horrors inflicted through slavery on Black people in the Caribbean, the British have traditionally preferred to think of their empire as having been seated in India. But starting long before the Raj, it was this region, the so-called West Indies, that would see a succession of the richest colonies in economic history,” French wrote.",
