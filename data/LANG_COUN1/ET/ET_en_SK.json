    "Slovakia: Salesian missionaries provide support for Ukrainian refugees - Slovakia": "Salesians in Slovakia also offering training courses for volunteers working with Ukrainian children\n\n(MissionNewswire) Salesian missionaries in Slovakia have been providing educational, social and medical support for Ukrainian refugees since the start of the war. Salesians have provided shelter for 45 youth from the orphanage in Lviv. Younger children, ages 6-11, have been housed directly with families, while the older children and youth, age 11-17, have been staying at Salesian centers. Some of these children have returned to Ukraine while 12 of the youth remain in Slovakia to continue their studies. They will attend school in Bratislava, Žilina and Hody.\n\nTo alleviate their stress and worries, children and youth have participated in numerous recreational activities, including sports, cultural trips, and educational visits. With the help of donors, they were also able to travel abroad, visiting Italy, Malta and Switzerland.\n\nSalesians in Slovakia have been offering training courses for volunteers working with Ukrainian children, helping them to understand how to deal with issues such as post-traumatic stress, crisis intervention, psychological support and more.\n\nIn Bratislava, Salesians offer Slovak language courses for women and children along with toy libraries and playrooms for children. The goal is to make children feel safe and integrated into their new communities.\n\n“Refugees need more support than just having a place to stay and their basic needs met,” said Father Gus Baek, director of Salesian Missions, the U.S. development arm of the Salesians of Don Bosco. “To truly be integrated and comfortable in their new home, refugees need to become part of the social fabric. Meeting those in the community and learning to speak the language are a few steps in easing the transition.”\n\nTo support the efforts in Ukraine*, Salesians have sent 12 trucks with food, medical supplies and personal hygiene products since the beginning of the war. Once the materials arrive in Ukraine, they are collected in a warehouse and then distributed to accessible places. Delivering the goods is not easy. The vans have been subjected to long and constant journeys, necessitating several vehicle repairs. In addition, one of the vehicles was damaged due to being hit by gunfire. Despite everything, the aid does not stop.\n\nSalesians continue to collect humanitarian aid and have organized logistical links among Italy, Austria, Switzerland and Germany. A large warehouse has been rented in the city of Prešov, Slovakia, which is used to store all the material before it’s sent to Ukraine.",

Army Col. Michael Firmin, director of Education, Training and Evaluation Department at the NATO Joint CBRN Defence Centre of Excellence noted the importance of the exercise.\n\n\n\n“Toxic Valley 22 - The Next Generation brings together CBRN sampling and laboratory analysis professionals from different NATO member countries,” said Firmin. “This exercise enables interoperability between our NATO partners on CBRN defense operations.\n\n\n\n“What is unique about this exercise is how to test these warfighters on various CBRN defense scenarios while using live chemical agents,” he said. “This provides them realistic and challenging training.\n\n\n\n“Additionally, it provides an opportunity for these warfighters to exchange best practices and lessons learned they have from this exercise, overall improving the professionalism of these key NATO units.”\n\n\n\nThe JCBRN Defence COE is a NATO military body and multinationally sponsored organization which offers recognized expertise and experience to the benefit of the alliance and other partners. Its activities are focused on the NATO transformation process, and operational support by providing defense advice and support of CBRN defense, education, training and exercises.\n\n\n\nEach team participated in two training scenarios per day for three days, conducting operations according to procedures outlined in the NATO Allied Engineering Publication 66, Handbook for Sampling and Identification of Biological, Chemical and Radiological Agents. The training scenarios included an abandoned factory used by terrorists to make chemical warfare agents, an illicit drug lab, and an underground bunker.\n\n\n\n“Exercise Toxic Valley is important for participating units because it gives soldiers the opportunity to develop trust in their protective equipment and gives commanders the chance to ensure that their soldiers are properly trained to perform their mission in a hot zone,” said Slovakian Army Col. Oliver Toderiška, commander of the Slovakian CBRN Corps and exercise director of Toxic Valley 2022. “This exercise is also important for the NATO alliance because it allows us to share our processes with each other, in some cases improve our techniques, and at the very least improve our capabilities to work together in common defense of our nations.”\n\n\n\n“Because sampling and analysis are time critical activities, each of the scenarios is time restricted,” said Toderiška. “You will see that each of the teams have different processes, but ideally the results will be the same.”\n\n\n\nThe Slovakian Army is justifiably proud of their accomplishments hosting Exercise Toxic Valley for the 10th time, and produced a small memento for the participants to commemorate the exercise.\n\n\n\n“Each year we come up with a new motto for the exercise,” said Toderiška. “This year’s motto, The Next Generation, represents the necessity of this generation’s corps of professionals to pass on our knowledge and skills to the next generation.”\n\n\n\nInterest in the exercise from NATO member nations has continuously increased over the years with 12 countries signing up for 2022 to exercise their SIBCRA teams.\n\n\n\nSince the facility is not large enough to host 12 teams simultaneously, eight teams exercised the first week with four new teams the second week.\n\n\n\nThe United States team participated the second week along with teams from Belgium, Lithuania and Slovenia.\n\n\n\n“The ability to conduct live agent training is vital to a CBRN Soldier, especially in this theater,” said Lt. Col. Mary Durham, commander, 773rd Civil Support Team. “We have the opportunity to gain proficiency and enhance our skill set for CBRN response both from a U.S. military and a partnership perspective with our NATO allies.\n\n\n\n“Usually our CBRN Soldiers get live agent training at our premier Chemical Defense Training Center in the U.S. which is located at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri.\n\n\n\n“They do the Chemical Defense Training Facility as young Soldiers or later on in their career, but they don’t get to do it often and they don’t usually get to use equipment organic to their unit.\n\n\n\n“This opportunity here in Slovakia allows our Soldiers to work with live agents using their own equipment, which is really vital to build trust in their equipment and to make sure they are comfortable using it in a contaminated environment,” she said.\n\n\n\nThe final day of the exercise was reserved for after action reports and team evaluations.\n\n\n\n“The Slovakian Army did a magnificent job on this exercise,” said Firmin, “and I want to thank them for all the great work they do every year to improve the professionalism of CBRN defense teams in NATO.”",
    "Slovakia’s pro-EU government can fall any moment, and it will be replaced by a pro-Russia President": "Remember how the Western powers exploited the Arab Spring to topple legal governments in nations like Syria, Iraq, Egypt, and Libya? What goes around comes around, so perhaps a European spring is now underway.\n\nEurope as a whole is seeing a severe reaction. Public outrage about government’s response to the Ukraine war is seen in many nations. Others are experiencing public discontent due to inflation and skyrocketing petrol costs. This implies that a number of European leaders might experience instability and potential regime upheaval. Slovakia seems like the next victim of European Spring.\n\nSlovakia’s pro-Ukraine stance\n\nAlthough there were never any disagreements, ties between Slovakia and Ukraine were never substantive. Only infrequently, and only when it was appropriate, did both nations bring one another up.\n\nBefore February 24, there was no news at all concerning Slovakia in Ukraine for several weeks. But, there are a lot of them lately. And they’re all positive.\n\nSlovakia was the first nation to offer long-range air defence to Ukraine. Slovakia provides armaments such as howitzers. Slovakia’s president joined the ranks of those who argued for Ukraine to be given candidate status, etc.\n\nIn contrast, society generally favours Russia. A Globsec study found that in 2021, 42% of Slovaks referred to Russia as a key partner and 78% of them thought of Russians as their “Slavic brothers.” 56% of Slovaks agree with the assertion that NATO is provoking Russia.\n\n55% of Slovaks who participated in another survey in the summer of 2021 expressed support for Russian President Vladimir Putin. Only Bulgarians (75%) had a more positive opinion of Putin among the nations of central and eastern Europe.\n\nAccording to a survey by MNFORCE, Seesame, and the Slovak Academy of Sciences, around one in five respondents stated they wanted Russia to win decisively, with more than half indicating they were nclined toward a Russian win. Only a third of respondents stated they preferred to favour Ukraine, and only 18% said they had no preference.\n\nFico and pro-Russian stance\n\nThe stance which the government has opted in Ukraine war and what people want is contrary. On a political level, divisions are very apparent. For instance, the vast majority of supporters of former Czech Prime Minister Robert Fico’s SMER-SD are supporting the Russian side.\n\nFico has been an outspoken opponent of anti-Russian sanctions and even joined the Russian ambassador to commemorate the anniversary of the Slovak National Uprising. Still a member of the Party of European Socialists is SMER-SD (PES).\n\nRegarding the regional disparities, the majority of the populace in Bratislava is in favour of Ukraine winning. Along with Bulgaria, Slovakia has long been one of the EU members that leans the most toward Russia.\n\nAlso Read: EU admits mistake, civil war breaks out in Germany and Europe descends into madness\n\nProtests and unstable government\n\nIn response to rising energy prices, thousands of people demonstrated in the capital of Slovakia on Tuesday and demanded an early election.\n\nSupporters of various parties, including the extreme right, participated in the rally, which was organised by the opposition Smer-Social Democracy party of former populist Prime Minister Robert Fico.\n\nFico said that the coalition government led by President Zuzana Caputova and Prime Minister Eduard Heger was largely to accountable for the high inflation that is currently affecting the EU country because of their steadfast backing of Ukraine during the Russian invasion.\n\nThe majority of speakers criticised the sanctions imposed by the European Union on Russia and applauded Hungary for its response to the energy crisis.\n\nHungary has a 15-year contract for the purchase of natural gas with Russian energy company Gazprom since it is largely reliant on Russian fossil resources. Viktor Orbán, the leader of Hungary, has campaigned vehemently against EU sanctions imposed on Russia as a result of its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMeanwhile, a junior coalition partner’s withdrawal from the ruling four-party alliance earlier this month left Heger without a parliamentary majority, weakening the Slovak administration.\n\nThe parliament is contemplating potential constitutional amendments that would permit an early election to be called either by a vote of MPs or by a nationwide referendum. Therefore, Slovakia’s pro-EU government will fall any moment, and it will be replaced by a pro-Russia President, possibly Robert Fico.",

    "Slovakia’s minority cabinet manages to open parliamentary session with help of opposition": "Slovak Prime Minister Eduard Heger's minority government has managed to open a parliamentary session after the opposition Smer party of ex-premier Robert Fico backed the move. Heger’s cabinet had failed to secure majority of deputies (76 of 150) to open a session on two previous occasions, casting doubt on its ability to govern and pass measures to combat the energy crisis.\n\n“Fico is more likely to keep his word than [Richard] Sulik”, Finance Minister Igor Matovic (of the populist OLaNO party) told Slovak media in yet another lash out at his former coalition partner, the leader of the rightwing SaS party. The rift between the two politicians is at the core of a months-long cabinet crisis which climaxed in SaS leaving the cabinet early in September.\n\nThe SaS had demanded Matovic's resignation as a condition for staying in the government. Matovic could still face an SaS-backed attempt to be removed by parliament majority, but the question is whether Smer would support such move or would rather wait for a more propitious time to bring down the government and hold early elections. The dismissal of Matovic might actually reinforce the goverment by allowing the SaS to re-enter the cabinet.\n\nParliamentary Speaker Boris Kollar, chairman of the radical rightwing populist Sme Rodina (We are family) party, the other main party in Heger’s coalition, made a concession to Smer-SD in order to secure its backing for the parliamentary session. Smer-SD had insisted the debate on a constitutional amendment to enable cabinet terms to be shortened by a referendum was discussed first.\n\nEarlier this month Slovak President Zuzana Caputova confirmed she will call a referendum after a Smer-instigated petition demanding the cabinet’s dismissal collected more than 350,000 signatures. However, she also referred the question of cabinet’s demise to the Constitutional Court to assess whether it is compatible with the Slovak Constitution which defines the duration of cabinet terms.\n\nFico is trying to exploit the cabinet infighting and the energy crisis to engineer a return to power. The leftwing populist leader, who is facing charges of criminal conspiracy, was forced to resign in 2020 after the murder of investigative journalist Jan Kuciak cast a light on the corrupt relationship between politicians, businessmen and police, prosecutors and judges.\n\nApproximately 5,000 people gathered on Tuesday evening outside the Presidential Palace in Bratislava city centre for a rally backed by Smer-SD. One of the speakers was Jozef Hambalek, who is on the EU’s sanction list for heading the Slovak branch of the far right bike gang the Night Wolves. Fico said the rally was inspired by the recent far right demonstration in Prague which, however, attracted a much larger crowd of 70,000.\n\nThe latest polls show Smer-SD is surging behind another leftwing opposition party, the Hlas-SD of former premier Peter Pellegrini, followed by SaS. Hlas has nearly 20%, with the leading coalition party, OLaNO, lagging far behind at 8%, while its former coalition partner SaS is at 13%.\n\nAlmost 60% of Slovaks would \"certainly\" or \"probably\" support a strong and uncompromising authoritarian leader acting on the edge of democratic principles, according to the poll conducted for commercial TV Joj.\n\nIn a separate development, new Slovak Minister of Foreign Affairs Rastislav Kacer summoned Russian Ambassador Igor Bratcikov for spreading hoaxes of alleged damage to a Russian military cemetery in Ladomirova in eastern Slovakia.\n\n“Fabricated claims about the cemetery in Ladomirova serve as a tool of Russian propaganda in Slovakia”, read the ministry’s press statement.\n\nIn August, Fico’s Smer-SD invited Bratcikov to Zvolen to take part in commemorations for the Slovak National Uprising against the Nazi puppet regime in Slovakia. Slovak neo-fascists still hark back to Jozef Tiso's fascist regime.",

Slovakia has authorized the operation of Mochovce’s Unit 3, which is expected to become fully operational by the end of 2022.\n\nDuring the mission, the team conducted interviews with management and staff from the Nuclear Regulatory Authority and from national authorities for radiation safety. The mission team leaders also met with the Minister of Health Vladimír Lengvarský.\n\nThe team accompanied the Nuclear Regulatory Authority and the Public Health Authority of the Slovak Republic during their inspections and oversight activities at regulated facilities.\n\n“The IRRS team identified several areas of good performance and made recommendations and suggestions to the regulatory authorities,” said the IRRS team leader Dana Drábová, chairperson of the Czech State Office for Nuclear Regulation. “Their appropriate adoption will enhance the effectiveness of the regulatory framework and functions in line with the IAEA Safety Standards.”\n\nGood performances in various regulatory areas demonstrate a continuous improvement of the Slovak Republic since the previous IRRS reviews. One of them is the open and transparent approach to the emergency preparedness and response inspection programme.\n\n“The Nuclear Regulatory Authority of the Slovak Republic highly appreciates external feedback on our regulatory processes and inspection activities, especially when it comes from a reputable international organization such as IAEA,” said Marta Žiaková, Chairperson of the Nuclear Regulatory Authority of the Slovak Republic. “Based on the received recommendations, we will enhance the quality of the regulatory performance in Slovakia.”\n\nThe IRRS team made several recommendations and suggestions to further enhance the Slovak regulatory system and the effectiveness of the regulatory functions in line with IAEA safety standards.\n\nRecommendations and suggestions for the Government of the Slovak Republic include:\n\nDevelopment of a national nuclear emergency plan.\n\nIncrease of the functional independence and resourcing of the Radiation Protection Departments of the Public Health Authority of the Slovak Republic and respective regional public health authorities, and the Ministry of Transport and Construction.\n\nImprovement in cooperation and coordination between the different regulatory authorities.\n\nRecommendations and suggestions for entities with regulatory responsibilities include:\n\nEstablishment of an integrated management system by some of the governmental authorities, and\n\nApplication of a graded approach to the delivery of the regulatory functions.\n\nThe final mission report will be provided to the Government of Slovakia in about three months. Slovakia plans to make the report public.\n\nBackground\n\nGeneral information about IRRS missions can be found on the IAEA website. IRRS are used to advise Member States on ways to strengthen and enhance the effectiveness of national regulatory frameworks for nuclear, radiation, radioactive waste and transport safety while recognizing the ultimate responsibility of each State to ensure safety in these areas.\n\nThe IAEA Safety Standards provide a robust framework of fundamental principles, requirements, and guidance to ensure safety. They reflect an international consensus and serve as a global reference for protecting people and the environment from the harmful effects of ionizing radiation.",

    "Slovakia has enough gas for winter if Russia puts total halt on supplies": "Gas reserves in Slovakia are large enough to last the whole winter, said executive director of major Slovak gas supplier SPP Richard Prokypčák.\n\nRussian gas giant Gazprom has already significantly lowered its exports to Europe but SPP claims supplies are approximately 70% of normal.\n\n“We have secured natural gas supplies in sufficient volume even in case Gazprom cuts SPP by 100%. In the current period there is a reduction to about 70%, it does not affect us. Gazprom already supplies us with a minority of the amount that is consumed,” Prokopčák said.\n\nBefore the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Slovakia had importing most of its gas from Russia.\n\nRecently, it has secured imports from various other suppliers. At the end of August, Slovakia opened a new gas interconnector with Poland, which opens access to LNG terminals in the Baltic Sea. After completing the Baltic Pipe Gas pipeline in October, it will also have access to Norwegian gas.\n\nAlmost 68% of households in Slovakia are connected to gas distribution.\n\n(Michal Hudec | EURACTIV.sk)",
    "Slovakia leaning towards national gas price cap for households": "The economy ministry has proposed a cap on the gas prices for households, and its minister, Richard Sulík, hopes to expand the current price cap on electricity prices.\n\nA price cap on gas is a novelty in Slovakia, as the Economy Ministry previously talked only about capping the electricity price cap. State Secretary Karol Galek explained that the ministry wants to use cheap gas from strategic reserves.\n\n“Slovakia has historically cheap gas that we could use to dilute the gas available on the market,” he said.\n\nCheaper gas should be available for all households regardless of the distributor. “They may be slightly higher than this year, but certainly not as high as market prices,” Galek continued.\n\nGas for delivery in 2023 crossed the €300 per megawatt-hour (MWh) mark on the Dutch TTF exchange last week, compared with €20 a year ago. If this considerable increase were to be reflected in household prices, they would pay at least three times more than they do now.\n\nAs for electricity, Slovakia previously capped 6.1 terawatt hours of electricity at €61 per megawatt for 2023 and 2024, but only the first four megawatts would be eligible for the discounted price. All the above would be priced according to the normal regulations. Approximately 40% of the electricity price is regulated.\n\nThe Slovak Regulatory Office for Network Industries estimated in June that the price would rise by at least 130% next year. That is why the Economy Ministry proposed to change the cheap electricity distribution based on the energy savings of different households.\n\nGalek explained that if households cut consumption by 15%, every megawatt would cost €61.\n\nThe government also wants to help the businesses in addition to the current proposal on the EU-wide electricity price cap.\n\n“In addition to what will eventually come out of discussions at EU level, the ministry has also prepared a state aid scheme. It is based on the temporary crisis framework that some countries apply today,” Galek said. These include compensations for three categories of businesses eligible for the aid worth up to €2, €25 and €50 millions.\n\nThe condition is that the companies must be making a loss and able to define the share of energy expenditure in their total expenditure set by the European Commission.",

The support will focus on groups particularly affected by the pandemic, such as unemployed people, self-employed individuals, micro and small businesses, and people in transition from education to the workplace.\n\nNorth Rhine-Westphalia will receive €34 million to support apprentices, trainings in commerce and trade, professional counselling and matching skilled workers with businesses.\n\nIn Slovakia, €17.9 million will support healthcare and civil protection workers and services that were in the first line of response during the most critical phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, bonuses will be distributed to help them ensure that at least 90% of critical personnel stay in their jobs.\n\nIn Bulgaria, €18.6 million will cover basic needs, such as food, of vulnerable groups. Vouchers will also be distributed to people who have fled Russia's invasion of Ukraine that can be exchanged for food and everyday necessities, such as clothing and school supplies for children. In addition, €36.4 million will be allocated for post-pandemic recovery measures aimed at job retention and improvement of care services for persons with disabilities. Out of these, €23.8 million will support the ‘Solidarity project' that helps 9,000 people fleeing the Russia's invasion of Ukraine to integrate into the Bulgarian labour market by, among others, offering psychological support, career guidance and employment counselling.\n\nThe 2021 tranche of REACT-EU had allocated €40 billion to help Member States recovering from the pandemic, investing in the digital and green transition and now hosting and integrating people fleeing the war in Ukraine. In addition, the Commission has paid €3.5 billion of pre-financing payments to Member States under REACT-EU since March 2022.\n\nThe most recent comprehensive package ‘Flexible Assistance to Territories (FAST-CARE)', proposed by the Commission, further extends the support to Member States by offering additional flexibility in Cohesion Policy funding while also increasing pre-financing payments by an additional €3.5 billion to be paid in 2022 and 2023.

    "Slovakia may cap electricity prices following Czech model": "New Economy Minister Karel Hirman claims Slovakia may take inspiration for a cap on electricity prices from the Czech Republic.\n\nThe Czech government recently announced its plan to cap electricity and gas prices for retail customers. The electricity price will be capped at six Czech crowns (€0.24) and the gas price at three crowns (€0.12). Cap should be in place by October for the period of next year.\n\nOn his first press briefing as Economy Minister, Hirman said that “this is the move Slovakia will most likely take as well.”\n\nFormer energy analyst Hirman became the minister after Richard Sulík and his Freedom and Solidarity party left the ruling coalition as a result of disagreements with former Finance Minister Igor Matovič.\n\nSlovakia previously capped 6.1 terawatt hours of electricity at €61 per megawatt for 2023 and 2024, but only the first four megawatts would be eligible for the discounted price. All the above would be priced according to the normal regulations. Approximately 40% of the electricity price is regulated.\n\nThis, however, applies only to households, while the Czech model also guarantees capped prices for businesses.\n\n“We are going to fight for this country together, yes, it is going to cost something, for all of us to make it through this period together in peace and with the preservation of production and living standards,” Hirman said.",
    "Slovakia divided on Commission’s proposal to cut EU funds for Hungary": "The decision of the European Commission to cut €7.5 billion in EU funding was criticised by Slovak parliament speaker Boris Kollár (We are Family) and opposition leader Robert Fico (SMER), while Slovak Prime Minister Eduard Heger (OĽaNO) said the decision could not be vetoed.\n\nThe European Commission proposed suspending the cohesion funds allocated for Hungary, resulting in a cut of €7.5 billion, roughly one-third of the whole allocation. Former three-time prime minister Robert Fico considers this to be “lunacy”.\n\n“If I were the prime minister of Slovakia, I would push to veto this decision,” Fico added.\n\nAccording to Fico, the reason for the Commission’s punishment is that Hungary has a different opinion on the war in Ukraine. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, he said, is “as fake as a Rolex from the Turkish market.”\n\nKollár agrees with Fico saying that although he does not support all the policies of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, he still is a democratically elected leader and the EU cannot make a precedent for such punishment.\n\n“This Commission proposal cannot be vetoed and will be decided by a qualified majority of countries after the one-month deadline has elapsed. We are ready to support the extension of the deadline by a further two months to give Hungary more time to negotiate,” explained Heger in a statement.\n\n(Michal Hudec | EURACTIV.sk)",

The vehicles will feature the remote-controlled Slovak Turra 30 turret and the 30mm GTS-30/A cannon, according to a news release by the Slovak Defence Ministry.\n\nThe company release did not provide a contract value. But Slovak Defence Minister Jaroslav Nad on Tuesday said Patria would sell each vehicle for €4.675 million (U.S. $4.682 million), which means the total value of the vehicle sale could be worth about €355.3 million.\n\nThe latest government-to-government deal will see Slovak companies help manufacture the vehicles, according to the Patria release. Manufacturing of the first eight vehicles will take place in Finland, and Slovak workers will travel there to learn about the process, the Slovak ministry said. Production for the remaining vehicles will occur in Slovakia in partnership with contractor Konštrukta Defence and six main Slovak subcontractors, the ministerial release added.\n\nThe first AMV XP vehicles are to be delivered to Slovakia as early as September 2023, the release said, with the ministry expecting the vehicles made in Slovakia to roll out beginning in 2024 and ending in 2027.\n\n“We will not only meet the 40% level of Slovak defence industry content, but we will even exceed this limit — already today I can confirm a nearly 43% stake, yet this may not be the final figure,” Nad said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nSlovakia’s efforts to improve its inventory of armored vehicles go back several years and are part of the country’s NATO commitments, Jukka Holkeri, executive vice president for Patria’s global division, told Defense News.\n\n“So in that sense, it’s not something that was invented recently,” he explained. “On the other hand, we firmly believe that the Russian aggression to Ukraine has made it more and more important” for countries like Slovakia to invest in defense.\n\nFor its part, Finland has learned several lessons from the war in Ukraine, according to Finnish Defence Minister Antti Kaikkonen. “[I]t has shown how important interoperability across partners is. Also thanks to this, we will give our armed forces the ability to cooperate. We will do all it takes to deliver the vehicles on time, so that Slovakia gets the much needed capabilities,” he was quoted as saying in the Slovak ministry release.\n\nOther nations in Central and Eastern Europe have in recent months worked to strengthen their defenses following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow launched Feb. 24.\n\nPoland expects to receive 250 Abrams tanks from General Dynamics by early 2025, the U.S. Army announced Thursday.

    "Prehistoric Mass Grave Uncovered in Slovakia": "Thursday, September 22, 2022\n\nVRÁBLE, SLOVAKIA—The Slovak Spectator reports that a mass grave containing the remains of some three dozen people has been uncovered at the site of a settlement in western Slovakia dated from 5250 to 4950 B.C. In its later stages, the settlement was fortified with a moat and a palisade with six entrances. Zuzana Hukelová of the Slovak Academy of Sciences said the bones were discovered in a ditch near one of these entrances. “The bodies originally lay in various positions—on their backs, on their stomachs, on their sides, some in a frog-like position,” she said. Many of the individuals are thought to have been young, although only one child’s skull has been recovered. Those at the bottom of the ditch were missing their heads, she added. Further research will try to determine if these people died at the same time, and if they died of illness or injury. Scientists will also attempt to retrieve DNA samples from the bones and look for relationships between the dead.

    "Slovakia: Russia accuses mayor of harming WWI soldier graves": "BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) — Officials in Slovakia dismissed claims by the Russian Embassy that graves of Russian soldiers from World War I were damaged on orders from the local village mayor.\n\nThe embassy said Russian Ambassador Igor Bratchikov visited the site in Ladomirova earlier this week and found the graves “almost completely destroyed.” In a statement, it accused Mayor Vladislav Cuper of being responsible for what it called “a blasphemous act.”\n\nA total of 270 Russian 8th army soldiers who died in what is now eastern Slovakia were buried at a village cemetery. The embassy said it financed a costly renovation of the graves eight years ago.\n\nMaros Zilinka, the prosecutor-general of Slovakia, said authorities would investigate what happened at the site.\n\nSince Russian invaded Ukraine in late February, several former communist nations and ex-Soviet republics have sped up the process of removing their remaining Soviet-era memorials.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCuper denied having the graves destroyed. He said some dilapidated concrete was removed and that his government planned to fix up the cemetery, as well as to approach the Russian Embassy with a request to financially support the work.\n\nIn a Facebook post, Slovakia’s national police force threw its weight behind the mayor and accused the embassy of lying. It said the mayor has received life threats following the Russian claims.\n\nThe territory of modern-day Slovakia was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which fought against Russia during World War I.",

    "Slovakia’s economy minister resigns as coalition crisis climaxes": "Chairman of the SaS party and Minister of Economy Richard Sulik resigned on Wednesday, as a deadline set by SaS for Minister of Finance Igor Matovic’s (OLaNO) departure from the cabinet passed.\n\nOther SaS ministers postponed their resignations to Monday to give more time to Matovic to leave the cabinet. The populist OLaNO party said Matovic will do so if the rightwing SaS supports OLaNO’s 10-point package of policies largely concerning with dealing with energy crisis.\n\nSome of these measures were previously contested by SaS but Matovic went behind the backs of his rightwing coalition partners in June to push them through with the help of opposition neo-Nazi deputies.\n\nSulik said that he was ready to discuss the measures, but only once Matovic left the government. \"We are requesting the fulfillment of our demand, and that is the exit of Igor Matovic,\" Sulik said, according to Reuters.\n\nThe main stand-off comes down to a personal conflict between Sulik and Matovic, whose impulsive and populist behaviour has been bringing the four-party coalition to the brink since last year. Sulik had already offered to resign his post if Matovic did.\n\n“We are giving him [Matovic] a couple of days to do what practically the entire country expects him to do,” said Sulik as he announced that the other SaS ministers would withhold their resignations until Monday. If SaS leaves the coalition, the cabinet of premier Eduard Heger (OLaNO) will lose its majority in the Slovak parliament.\n\nSlovak President Zuzana Caputova called on Heger to explain to the public how a cabinet without a majority will govern, and “how it will obtain support for important legislation”.\n\nIf SaS leaves the government, it will become a tandem of two personal populist parties, Matovic’s anti-corruption movement OLaNO, and Boris Kollar’s radical rightwing force, We are Family, which sits with Marine Le Pen’s National Rally in the European Parliament.\n\nThere is also a risk of deadlock that could lead to early elections that bring former premier Robert Fico back to power.\n\nCaputova openly criticized Matovic for coming up with another ultimatum on the very last day of the ultimatum set by SaS, adding that “nobody is interested” in “prolonging the never-ending saga” between Matovic and Sulik.\n\nSlovakia is having a hard time coping with the financial and energy crisis amid the tense geopolitical situation. The number of Slovak pensioners falling into poverty is rising as they constitute one of the most vulnerable parts of the society that are unable to afford the dramatically rising costs of living.\n\nSome Slovak production plants have decided to halt production, including aluminium plant Slovalco, causing hundreds to lose their jobs.\n\nCaputova also warned against the collapse of health sector. “People are falling into income poverty and their wrath is reaching record levels. We cannot be hazarding with their patience” added Caputova.\n\nPopulists and extremist opposition parties have been preying on the energy and coalition crisis, calling for early election.\n\nAs Slovakia celebrated Monday’s anniversary of the 1944 Slovak National Uprising brutally crushed by the Nazis, ex-premier Robert Fico, who faces charges of criminal conspiracy relating to his time in office, and his SMER party brought representatives of the Russian and Belarussian embassies to the commemoration in Zvolen, Central Slovakia, sparking condemnation from all leaders of the ruling coalition.",
    "On this Day, in 1941: Nazi-aligned Slovakia adopted the “Jewish Codex”": "On September 9, 1941, the Nazi-puppet state of Slovakia ratified the Jewish Codex, paving the way for the exclusion, deportation, and mass extermination of Slovak Jews during the second half of World War II.\n\nIn September 1938, the Munich agreement sanctioned Nazi Germany’s annexation of the Sudetenland, while the First Vienna Award in November forced Czechoslovakia to surrender large parts of southern Slovakia to Hungary. One day before Nazi troops entered the Czech lands from the west in March 1939, Slovak authorities nominally declared independence to become a puppet state of the Third Reich, led by Catholic priest Jozef Tiso.\n\nDrawing on deeply-rooted anti-Semitism which, for centuries, had blamed Jews for the exploitation of ethnic Slovaks, anti-Jewish propaganda and the harassment of Jews throughout began soon after the declaration of “independence”: racial measures passed between 1939 and 1941 included the firing of Jewish employees from state institutions, robberies and physical attacks against Jewish-owned businesses – often instigated by the infamous Hlinka Guard – and the gradual dispossession of their wealth, land and goods through government regulations.\n\nRatified by Slovakia’s Parliament on September 9,1941, the Jewish Codex was a series of laws effectively stripping Slovakia’s 80,000 Jews of their fundamental civil rights and excluding them from the social, cultural and economic spheres. Codifying previous regulations and paving the way for their deportation, the Jewish Codex was considered even more radical than Germany’s own 1935 Nuremberg laws.\n\n“In 1940 and 1941, degrading measures arrived,” recounts Holocaust survivor Eli Vago. “I think there wasn’t a day when a new one wasn’t issued. They drove us out of schools. They forced us to wear a yellow star […] We weren’t allowed to go to cinemas. We were prohibited from leaving our homes in the evening.”\n\nSlovakia’s ultimate solution to the “Jewish Question” would become all too evident the following year. During the first wave of deportations, from March to October 1942, nearly 58,000 Slovak Jews were sent to Nazi concentration and extermination camps. The Slovak state even paid 500 Reich marks per deportee as an evacuation fee, something unprecedented among Germany’s satellite states.\n\nShortly after Nazi troops invaded Slovakia to crush the national uprising in August 1944, an additional 14,000 Jewish people were deported from September to November, mostly to Auschwitz in Nazi-occupied Poland and Terezin, north of Prague.\n\nIn total, about 70,000 Slovak Jews were murdered during the Second World War, representing about 80% of the country’s pre-war Jewish population.\n\nIn 2000, Slovakia’s lawmakers established the Memorial Day for Victims of the Holocaust and Racial Violence on September 9, on the same day the Jewish Codex was ratified more than 50 years earlier.\n\nOn the eve of the 80th anniversary of its adoption, on September 8, 2021, the Slovak government issued a historic public apology to “express sorrow over the crimes committed by the government of the day, especially over the fact that on 9 September 1941 it passed a shameful decree restricting the basic human rights and freedoms of citizens of Jewish origin.” A commemoration ceremony was held the next day at the Sereď Holocaust Museum, attended by Slovak President Zuzana Caputova and other high-ranking officials and representatives of the Jewish community.\n\nThe discrimination and deportation of Jews in Slovakia, including the “Aryanisation” policy, are famously depicted in the 1965 Oscar-winning film The Shop on Main Street, directed by Ján Kadár and Elmar Klos.\n\nFind out more about Central European history in our On this Day series.",

The 18 independent experts at CERD also expressed their concern that the court proceedings in cases of such discrimination are too lengthy, which prevents victims from effectively accessing justice.\n\nThe CERD recommended Slovakia \"take appropriate measures to address the problem of lengthy court proceedings and take the necessary steps to ensure that all victims of racial discrimination have the opportunity to file adequate remedies\". The committee also expressed concern that the closure of schools during the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately negatively impacted Romani children's access to education.\n\nExperts pointed to the fact that many Romani children could not participate in online education due to their insufficient access to the Internet. The experts appealed to Slovakia to take the necessary measures to address the root causes of the discrimination and segregation of Romani children in the education system and to intensify their efforts to ensure equal opportunities for Romani children in access to quality education.",

    "Czechia and Slovakia accelerate decoupling from decades-long nuclear partnership with Moscow": "Czechia and Slovakia have accelerated their decoupling from their decades-long nuclear partnership with Moscow. Recent moves demonstrate that Central European states are moving to widen the cutting off of Russian energy links beyond gas, oil and coal, to include nuclear fuel and technology, where they have long been dependent on Moscow.\n\nCzechia announced on September 12 that it will end its membership of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubno near Moscow (JINR) by December 31. Earlier this year, CEZ, the country's dominant largely state-owned electric utility, announced it would obtain its fuel supplies for its Temelin nuclear power plant (NPP) from Westinghouse of the US and France's Framatome from 2024.\n\nSlovak officials have also proclaimed divestment plans from Russian nuclear fuel. Branislav Strycek, head of Slovenske Elektrarne, the country's dominant partly state-owned electric utility, told media this week that Slovakia can now divest from nuclear fuel supplies from Russia.\n\nThe Czech Ministry of Education put out a proposal to leave JINR in March in response to the Russian army’s attacks on the nuclear facility in Zaporizhiya in Ukraine, which have mounted since then. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) describes the security situation at the site held now by Russian forces as “precarious”.\n\nThe Czech parliament voted to leave JINR in July and the cabinet aims to conclude the whole process by September in order to avoid paying more money to JINR. As a member country, Czechia paid some CZK130mn (€5.3mn) in annual fees.\n\n“As of December 31 of this year Czech Republic ends its 66-years-long membership in the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR), where the Russian Federation is the dominant member and on whose territory this international organisation resides”, reads the Czech Ministry of Education statement.\n\nCzechia has also launched the process of terminating fuel supplies from TVEL, Rosatom’s nuclear fuel supplying arm, and switching to Western suppliers. Deliveries of new US/French assemblies to the Temelin nuclear plant will begin in 2024. Currently, in Temelin the company has fuel assemblies for approximately two years of operation of the Russian-designed VVER-1000 reactors.\n\nCEZ has also reportedly been in talks with Westinghouse over nuclear fuel supplies for Dukovany’s Russian-designed VVER-440 reactors. The country's second nuclear plant currently has supplies of Russian nuclear fuel for even longer than at Temelin.\n\nThe government launched a tender to expand Dukovany in March, with Russia's Rosatom having been excluded in March 2021 because of Moscow's alleged involvement in the sabotage of the Vrbetice ammunition depot.\n\nSlovakia is also trying to cut its Russian links for supplies to its VVER-440 reactors. Slovenske Elektrarne's CEO has stressed that Slovakia is not dependent solely on Russia anymore.\n\n“We launched an international tender for new supplies of nuclear fuel a month ago”, Strycek told reporters as the recently authorised new nuclear reactor at the Mochovce NPP began to load fuel.\n\nFrench Framatore and American Westinghouse are expected to enter the tender besides TVEL, the current supplier.\n\nWestinghouse, however, does not currently produce the fuel needed by the Slovak nuclear power plants at Mochovce and Bohunice and it would also likely be more expensive. Nevertheless, Strycek said Slovenske Elektrarne have been in touch with other VVER-440 operators and that Westinghouse had already developed and tested fuel for these type of reactors.\n\nBoth countries have been tied to Soviet nuclear technology since they were satellites of the Soviet Union and even today the Russian nuclear lobby is still a powerful voice in their energy politics. As recently as last year a large portion of the Czech political establishment, including the populist ANO party of controversial billionaire Andrej Babis and members of the ruling ODS party such as influential South Bohemian Governor Martin Kuba argued for Rosatom to take part in the planned tender for the expansion of the Dukovany NPP on the grounds that it would push down the costs.\n\nBulgaria, Hungary and Finland also still rely on Russian nuclear fuel for their Russian-designed VVER-400 reactors. However, neither Bulgaria nor Hungary is looking to cut their nuclear ties with Moscow. Hungary is even deepening its links by commisioning Russia's Rosatom to build its long-delayed new nuclear reactors at Paks.\n\nAlthough Bulgaria attempted to cut its ties with Russia during the previous government of Kiril Petkov, the interim cabinet of Gulub Donev appointed by President Rumen Radev seems determined to bring the country back into the Russian energy orbit.",

    "Slovakia may nationalise its main electricity producer, says finance minister": "If necessary, Slovakia may nationalise electricity producer Slovenské elektrárne to guarantee cheap electricity for the people, Finance Minister Igor Matovič announced on Sunday (11 September).\n\nSlovenské elektrárne is currently owned by Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský’s EPH and Italian energy giant Enel. Together, they own two-thirds of the shares, with the rest belonging to Slovakia’s economy ministry. The company operates Slovakia’s two nuclear power plants – Jaslovské Bohunice and Mochovce.\n\nAccording to Matovič, it may be necessary for the state to step in to guarantee fair prices as the price of electricity production from nuclear power plants does not correspond with the market price.\n\n“One of the solutions of the energy crisis is that we will try to come to an agreement with the current shareholders to buy back the share in Slovenské elektrárne,” Matovič said after he criticised the government of Mikuláš Dzurinda for privatising the company almost 20 years ago.\n\nMatovič did not say how much it would cost but said nationalisation would be the “solution of the last resort”.\n\nNational Council member Marián Viskupič from Freedom and Solidarity party, which left the government coalition last week, agrees that the privatisation of Slovenské elektrárne was a mistake but said that purchasing the majority share is not feasible.\n\n“Given our financial situation and budget deficits we currently have and will have in the upcoming years, there is no room for the state to buy Slovenské elektrárne back,” Viskupič said.\n\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Eduard Heger (OĽaNO) said he supports the pan-European solution of a windfall profits tax.

    "Slovakia’s DRS highlighted at RWM Letsrecycle Live": "After introducing the session, Mr Budaj took a tour of the exhibition, looking at a variety of bins from exhibitors and finding out about food waste solutions.\n\nThe Slovak Ministry of Environment said he gained insight on how to decrease the amount of municipal waste ending up in landfill, including prevention of waste in the first place.\n\nAfter Mr Budaj’s introduction, Lucia Morvai, the director of external affairs and communications at Deposit Return System Administrator, took over to unravel Slovakia’s journey towards implementation of the scheme.\n\nMs Morvai explained that the DRS was launched in Slovakia on 1 January 2022 after a “remarkably short implementation process”, with the country implementing the scheme a year after it was passed by parliament.\n\nMs Morvai highlighted that since its launch at the beginning of the year, the DRS has collected 540 million plastic bottles and aluminium cans, which comprise 67% of those supplied to the market. The goal is to achieve 90% collection rate of beverage packaging by 2025, which is four years earlier than mandated by the European Union.\n\nThe rollout of the scheme was funded by the obliged industry of drinks producers and retailers and was implemented as a way of extending producer responsibility, Ms Morvai continued. The DRS continues to be funded from fees paid by producers, sale of the material and unclaimed deposits.\n\nScheme\n\nEach container has a returnable deposit of €0.15, which is displayed separately to the price on the supermarket shelves. Consumers can return their packaging through reverse vending machines, found in most supermarkets or handheld scanners, which are mostly utilised by smaller businesses due to lack of space.\n\nThere are currently over 2,900 collections points, which see an average of 3.5 million containers returned daily.\n\nTechnology\n\nIn terms of technology, the Slovak DRS is powered by a solution from Sensoneo, a Slovakia-based digital waste management company. The solution integrates the data of all stakeholders, and executes all operations regarding registration, distribution, depositing and logistics in real time.\n\nThe lifecycle of each container is traceable from when it enters the market until it is returned in the form of recycled material for new bottles and cans, with operations including optimisation of transport routes and logistics to lower the carbon footprint.\n\nCommenting on her experience of RWM and Letsrecycle Live, Ms Morvai said: “The exhibition was a great platform to share the experience of implementing the DRS in Slovakia, which is, I believe, truly valuable for countries that are currently in the stage of planning out their own nationwide system. Sharing knowledge is one of the ways we can support closing the loop and driving the transition toward a circular economy.”",

    "Research Terms of Reference: Multi-Sector Needs Assessment (MSNA) Light, 96AVH Slovakia (May 2022) - Slovakia": "Background\n\nSince 24 February 2022, an increasing number of refugees and third-country nationals (TCNs) entering Slovakia has been registered as a result of the war in Ukraine. As of 25th May, Slovak authorities have reported 454,023 arrivals from Ukraine out of whom 419,710 were Ukrainian refugees and 13,899 third-country nationals (TCNs).1 Slovakia has been mainly a transit country but is increasingly becoming a country of destination. Both for the Government and for the public, managing such a large population of refugees was a relatively new challenge. Between 24 February and 23 of June 2022, a total of 82,799 persons requested temporary protection in the territory of Slovakia in connection with the conflict in Ukraine. Out of these, the vast majority were from Ukrainian nationals (99,4%) and less than 1% from third-country nationals – 526 requests of temporary protection from persons of 44 different nationalities were received in Slovakia (as per June 2022).2 Data collected by REACH between 4 March and 5 June also indicated that 38% of respondents crossing the border into Slovakia considered it as their final destination and that 65% of those intended to stay in the country as long as the conflict in Ukraine continued. 3 To respond to their needs, the Slovakian authorities have established around 200 Refugee Accommodation Centres (RACs). As of 13 March, the RACs were hosting 6627 refugees. While these centres are playing a key role in the humanitarian response, the overwhelming majority of refugees are residing in the host community; however, little to no information is currently available to response actors regarding their demographic profile, household composition, geographical presence, vulnerabilities, humanitarian needs, movement intentions, or coping capacities. This context of urgency together with capacity constraints are the reasons for the MSNA Light.",
