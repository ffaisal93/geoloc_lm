    "Former Bulgarian minister slams the country’s ‘neutral’ stance on Ukraine": "Bulgarian former foreign minister Ivailo Kalfin criticised his country’s stance in the context of the Russian aggression in Ukraine, insisting that calls for “neutrality” were completely out of place.\n\nKalfin, board member of EURACTIV.bg and Dublin-based executive director of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound), made the comments in an interview for Bulgarian national radio.\n\nBulgarians will vote in snap elections on Sunday, with the war in Ukraine looming large in the campaign.\n\nThe leader of the pro-Russian force “Vazrazhdane” (Revival) Kostadin Kostadinov has reiterated his demand of “full neutrality of Bulgaria in the Ukraine war, and leaders and organisations of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) too have made calls for neutrality.\n\nAccording to Kalfin, there is a mood both in Bulgaria and in other countries to stop aid to Ukraine to quickly end the war, but “this means that Russia will quickly achieve its goals”:\n\n“Obviously, Putin’s ideas are to expand the territory of Russia. This is obviously unacceptable. This is why Bulgaria should not be neutral”, he said.\n\nKalfin emphasised that Russia has lost a huge part of its influence in international relations.\n\n“One of the problems is that Russia is a permanent member of the UN Security Council. It is the most authoritative organisation that should speak on such issues, including the preservation of territorial integrity. With its behaviour, Russia is liquidating this function of the Security Council, which can no longer work effectively”, he said.\n\nOn the referendums currently being organised in the four Russian-controlled regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, Kalfin said that without any doubt, the international community will not accept their results.\n\nOn replacing Russian gas in Europe, Kalfin was more doubtful, claiming that it cannot be completely replaced – though “Russia cannot redirect its supplies from Europe to China and India, for example.. For logistical reasons, Russia cannot sell it there in such quantities.”\n\nHe also commented on the attempts of the caretaker government to engage in negotiations with Gazprom for resuming gas supplies, which the Russian monopolist stopped completely in April.\n\n“These attempts are frivolous. Gazprom is not a supplier of cheap gas to Bulgaria, this is not an option and will not be an alternative. Gazprom” will use the gas as a political weapon, and some political parties in our country will gladly help them play this game. In general – if you are obedient to the Kremlin, you can get some crumbs, which is insulting to Bulgaria and should not happen. I do not expect negotiations with Gazprom to lead to a result and to alternative cheap gas for our country.”\n\n(Krassen Nikolov | EURACTIV.bg)",
    "Bulgaria: New UNHCR protection cash assistance programme for refugees from Ukraine": "UNHCR Bulgaria announced a new programme that aims to provide financial aid to Ukrainian nationals who have registered under temporary protection, are seeking international protection or have already been granted it.\n\nThe aid will be provided to households that meet the following three criteria\n\nThe household falls in one of these vulnerability categories:\n\na member of the household has a serious physical, psychological, intellectual or sensory impairment;\n\na member of the household has a serious medical condition that requires (ongoing) treatment or incapacitates the person to take independent care of themselves;\n\na member of the household is a child at risk: a child parent, child spouse, teenage pregnancy, child engaged in child labour (a child under 16 years old who engages in work which is likely to be harmful to his/her development or interferes with his/her education), unaccompanied child, separated child;\n\na member of the household is an elderly person at risk: person/couple of 60 years old or older, without any family members in the country, person/couple of 60 years old or older who is/are the sole caretakers of children in the household (younger than 18 years old);\n\na member of the household who is a pregnant or lactating woman;\n\na member of the household who is a single parent to three or more children;\n\na member of the household who is exposed to risk or has survived gender–based violence;\n\na member of the household who is a survivor of torture;\n\na member of the household who is a survivor of human trafficking;\n\na member of the household who is a person with severe emotional or psychological trauma;\n\na member of the household who is a LGBTQ person facing specific safety risks.\n\nThe household has limited means of coping due to limited financial resources/lack of access to income A one-time payment of protection cash assistance will most likely decrease the household’s vulnerability\n\nThe minimum amount of financial aid available is 190 EUR, and grants will increase depending on the vulnerability and size of the family. In principle, financial aid is to be granted only once; twice in exceptional circumstances.\n\nCandidates themselves cannot apply directly, rather they must be referred by one of UNHCR’s partners (Bulgarian Red Cross, Bulgarian Helsinki Committee, Council of Refugee Women in Bulgaria, Foundation for Access to Rights) or by international organisations (UNICEF, IOM).\n\nIn the initial phase of the programme - verification interviews - will be run only in Sofia, Varna and Burgas.

    "Bulgarian election woes leave power to president": "The upcoming elections, the fourth in less than two years, are unlikely to give Bulgaria a stable coalition, analysts predict, leaving the ruling of the Balkan EU member in the hands of a strong presidency and a grey undefined geopolitical zone between the West and Russia.\n\nSevere conflicts between the main political players make it almost impossible to form broad coalitions that can gather enough support to project stable governance.\n\nWhen asked if the political formula for what pundits call a “government of national salvation” after the upcoming 2 October parliamentary elections is possible, political scientist Georgi Kiryakov replied, “Bulgaria does not need national salvation.”\n\n“This is a propaganda cliché”, Kiryakov said, pointing out, “Bulgaria is not in such a dire economic, financial and social situation that it needs national salvation.”\n\nAccording to the analyst, while there are problems with inflation and some sectors of the economy because of gas prices, the situation is not “dire.”\n\n“There is a need for a stable government, including a coalition one, which is not emerging at this stage,” he added.\n\nThe latest survey by the Exakta agency shows that GERB (EPP), the party of former prime minister Boyko Borissov continues to find itself in political isolation, being blamed for corruption in the country by almost all opponents, has the support of 26.2% of Bulgarians.\n\n“We continue the change”, which gave Bulgaria its last prime minister Kiril Petkov, is second with 18.1%.\n\nThe third place is contested between the Russia-leaning Bulgarian Socialist Party (12.5%) and the anti-European pro-Russian party Vazrazhdane (9.5%), as well as the party of the Turkish minority DPS (10.3%), which relies on great support from Bulgarian citizens of Turkish origin who live in Turkey.\n\nThe pro-European “Democratic Bulgaria” has the support of 7.5%, the populist “There is such a people”, which caused the fall of the last reformist government that was in office for just over six months, with 5.4%, trailed by the conservative pro-Russian “Bulgarian Rise” (4%).\n\nWith GERB politically isolated and “We continue the change” unlikely to gather enough support to form a government, political analysts assume that at the beginning of next year, the Bulgarians will be forced to vote for the fifth time and that President Rumen Radev will continue to rule Bulgaria as a presidential, instead of a parliamentary, republic.\n\nIf no stable government is formed, Bulgaria will continue to be governed by a caretaker government appointed by Radev. The country’s constitution gives enormous power to the president in a situation with an overthrown government and a dissolved parliament. At these times, he could rule the country with almost unlimited powers.\n\n“These caretaker governments have unclear goals and unclear priorities, and most importantly – they are uncontrolled. There is no direct control from the parliament and the parties, which are the representatives of the citizens,” said Kyryakov.\n\nIn his view, Radev may have the undeclared goal of leaving Bulgaria in the grey undefined geopolitical zone between the West and Russia, which benefits the regime in the Kremlin.\n\nPro-Western parties in the country strongly criticised Radev’s caretaker government for its decision to review its position towards Gazprom and try to enter into negotiations to resume suspended gas supplies.\n\nGazprom silent over Sofia’s invitation for gas talks Russian state gas company Gazprom still has not answered the Bulgarian authorities’ invitation to resume negotiations to restart gas supplies to the country. Energy Minister Rosen Hristov announced last week that entering into negotiations with Gazprom would now be inevitable after …\n\n“Disappointment with democracy and a permanent political failure, in which the people do not want to vote and the parties want to rule, are the worst scenarios for Bulgaria after the elections,” said Parvan Simeonov, a political analyst from Gallup International Balkan, in an interview with EURACTIV.\n\n“I hope it doesn’t turn out at some point that no one wants to rule, and everyone expects the president to pull the chestnuts out of the fire,” he added.\n\nSimeonov also spoke of recent claims that some parties pass the ball to the president for sole power.\n\n“It’s not a ball; it’s a hot potato; they’re looking for someone to take responsibility,” he commented.\n\n“It would be nice if people did not decide that the Bulgarian parties are impotent and decide not to vote. Especially in winter, when the quality of life is the main thing that excites them. The parties can realise this and look for compromise options,” he added.\n\n“There is polarisation in society because of the war, although it is not so great because Bulgarians are far from extremes. But it affects everyone who is operationally responsible for power,” said Simeonov. (Krassen Nikolov | EURACTIV.bb)",

The deal was completed in March.\n\nThe company's activities are centred on enabling digital start-ups and other businesses build sustainable IT teams to further the economic development of smaller urban areas, by meeting their needs for software and staff. The company facilitates technology projects in the areas of healthcare, renewable energy and education, with clients also hailing from the fintech, telecoms and media industries.\n\n\"Bulgaria was a logical next step for us as the market opportunities and people are a great culture and values match. We were looking to expand our presence and add EU delivery capabilities, and Bulgaria is a top contender in that regard,\" Bochev said.\n\nFounded in 2012, the Swedish company has a total workforce of around 600 and operations at home as well as in Poland and Ukraine. It was set up with a social impact in mind, prioritising the creation of sustainable teams, emphasising care for society and the environment as a key driving force.\n\nBeetroot said at the time of the acquisition of South Gate Tech that Bulgaria will be its second full-scale EU service centre, with Poland to follow in the near future.\n\nAccording to Bochev, Beetroot Bulgaria is not targeting a rapid local expansion, but is rather hand-picking a team of engineers with the goal of solidifying its capabilities, expanding its activity scope and presence in Bulgaria before looking elsewhere in Southeast Europe.\n\n\"We are always keeping our finger on the pulse to identify new opportunities, especially if we come across companies and partners that share our vision and mindset. With that said, we are committed and have a strong focus on Bulgaria specifically – we know that there’s a risk of losing a sense of quality and people-oriented attitude if we spread our attention too widely. A successful “Bulgaria story”, with measurable impact, means that we’ll be better prepared for future expansions,\" Bochev explained.\n\nLooking ahead, the consultancy sees itself opening a couple of Beetroot hubs around the country and locally launching Beetroot Academy, the company's Swedish-Ukrainian non-profit education arm.\n\nIn Ukraine, the Swedish parent company invested $50 million (51.7 million euro) in 2021, it said in a press release earlier this month.\n\n($ = 1.03355 euro)",

    "Bulgarian Parliamentary Candidate Too Busy To Campaign As He Fights In Ukraine": "Politicians in Bulgaria are crisscrossing the Balkan country of nearly 7 million to convince voters to cast ballots for them in snap parliamentary elections scheduled for October 2.\n\nBut one candidate, Ivan Kalchev, is not on the campaign trail, but the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\nKalchev traveled to Ukraine in early March to join up with the foreign legion organized by Kyiv, shortly after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine on February 24.\n\nIn fact, Kalchev told RFE/RL's Bulgarian Service that he is now taking part in the Ukrainian counteroffensive. \"Everything was very well prepared and organized and there is nothing accidental about the successes,\" Kalchev stated, adding that life on the battlefield is nothing like in the movies.\n\nUkraine's much-anticipated counterattack launched early this month has dealt not only a blow to Russia's military but provided Ukrainians with hope amid what has been a dramatic change in momentum.\n\nKalchev has been awed by the reaction of overjoyed Ukrainians in freed towns and villages. \"With joy, with pride, with tears in my eyes, I just see how these people are happy to be freed,\" Kalchev told RFE/RL from an undisclosed location.\n\nShortly after Russian forces invaded Ukraine in February, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy appealed to foreigners willing to help defend Ukraine and join the fight.\n\nWATCH: Soldiers from around the world continue to join Ukraine's foreign legion, motivated by the need to help with \"the most important conflict in the last 50 years,\" as one American volunteer put it.\n\nThe government even set up a website for them to join the international brigade, which is now thought to number in the thousands, with one recent estimate putting the figure at some 20,000.\n\nFighting For Reform\n\nAs Kalchev helps Ukraine reclaim its land from invading Russian forces, back at home politicians are battling for ballots.\n\nBulgaria -- a member of the European Union and NATO -- is holding early parliamentary elections on October 2, the fourth such poll in less than two years amid much political instability.\n\nThe reformist government led by Kiril Petkov collapsed in June, six months after one of its coalition partners quit. Petkov, who heads the We Continue the Change (PP) party, which came to power in November 2021, has struggled to deliver on his pledge to stamp out corruption.\n\nHe has also backed Ukraine in its fight against Russia in a country traditionally friendly toward Moscow.\n\nPetkov fired Defense Minister Stefan Yanev for his reluctance to describe the Russian invasion as a war. In June, Petkov expelled 70 Russian diplomatic staff, accusing them of working against Sofia's interests.\n\nFrom Star Student To Soldier\n\nKalchev was a star student in Sofia, graduating from the National High School of Natural Sciences with honors, before studying physics and information technology at university.\n\nAs a kid, his schoolmates called him \"Gligi\" for the necklace he wore adorned with the teeth of wild boars -- gligi in Bulgarian.\n\nIn eighth grade, he befriended Vladimir Yonchev, the founder and editor in chief of the OffNews website, https://offnews.bg/ who told RFE/RL that Kalchev was \"one of the smartest people he knows.\" Yonchev said he also studied physics, computer science, and politics, while spending his remaining free time riding his motorcycle or melding metal in the special furnace he built himself.\n\nYonchev also recalls how Kalchev's political passion led to his joining the Green Movement party in 2013, rising through its leadership ranks over the years. Members of the environmentally friendly Green Movement were at the vanguard of anti-government protests that swept Bulgaria in 2020-21.\n\nBut despite his rich and impressive background, there was one thing Kalchev lacked, especially given his current location and vocation: military training. In fact, just a week before he set off for Ukraine, Kalchev said he got his first training.\n\nIn the early months of the war, Kalchev didn't see any military action. Instead, he carried out multiple tasks, from translating -- he speaks English -- to troubleshooting -- making sure the Starlink Internet satellite connection was working -- to even evacuating the wounded, he recounted in an interview with OffNews in late June.\n\nThat all changed, Kalchev told RFE/RL, shortly after Ukraine's military launched its counteroffensive, largely in the northeastern corner of the country.\n\nRussian forces suffered a stunning reversal this month after Ukrainian troops made a rapid armored thrust with special forces in the northeastern region of Kharkiv, forcing a sometimes rushed and chaotic Russian withdrawal.\n\nZelenskiy said on September 14 that his army had liberated around 8,000 square kilometers.\n\nIt's been the swiftest advance by Ukrainian forces since driving Russian forces away from the capital of Kyiv in March, and some analysts say it has turned the tide of the seven-month invasion.\n\nFor Kalchev, modern warfare has little in common with its portrayal in Hollywood films, with lots of time spent doing nothing, just waiting.\n\nThat all changed abruptly when the counteroffensive started and sleep became much shorter, sometimes just two hours a night, Kalchev said.\n\nHe was awed at the array of military might the Ukrainians had at their disposal. \"Even in a computer game, I have never seen so many tanks and APCs (armored personnel carriers) as I saw there,\" Kalchev said.\n\nDespite the horrors of war, the reaction of those in freed towns and villages has buoyed his spirits. \"In all the villages we have liberated, people have taken to the streets, usually one main street that runs through the village. They come outside, with flags, with balloons, waving the flags, smiling at us and waving at every military vehicle that passes by,\" Kalchev said.\n\nCertain hazards remain in liberated territories, Kalchev points out, such as mines or unexploded artillery shells.\n\nIt's unclear how many Bulgarians are in Ukraine fighting on the side of Kyiv's forces. In the early days of the invasion, news emerged of a Bulgarian battalion in Ukraine.

For the most part, we have firm guarantees that what was done in the post-war period in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the international community is not ready to sacrifice by not continuing any form of mission,” said Podžić, stating that Annex 1a of the Dayton Peace Agreement states that NATO is responsible for the implementation of the military part of that agreement in Bosnia and Herzegovina. – alliance.",

    "Bulgaria’s Ready To Negotiate Gas Deal With Russia’s Gazprom After Government Changes": "SOURCE:kremlin.ru\n\nGazprom cut the deliveries to Bulgaria on April 27 as Sofia refused to pay for gas in rubles following a new scheme floated by President Vladimir Putin. But the Bulgaria-Greece interconnector, which should bring 1 bcm of Azerbaijani gas to Bulgaria, or a third of its consumption, has not been completed yet. Azerbaijani gas will flow through the interconnector from October 1. Former Prime Minister Kiril Petkov said a day before stepping down that Bulgaria had secured seven cargo shipments of U.S. liquefied gas (LNG) to ensure gas inflows in the winter. However, Bulgaria has no LNG terminals while it is costly to regasify LNG in Greece and Turkey, adding new costs to the final price. The acting government has secured just one cargo shipment of liquefied gas. At the same time, trade unions and businesses urge the government to resume talks, saying high gas prices will eventually leave many companies bankrupt. On August 22, Deputy Prime Minister Hristo Alexiev and Energy Minister Rossen Hristov attended an emergency meeting to address the energy crisis. Bulgarian Prime Minister Galab Donev said the situation is critical before winter. Four days later, interim Energy Minister Rossen Hristov said the Bulgarian government asked Gazprom to resume talks on gas supplies. “We have signaled our readiness to negotiate and we have a set of proposals for a new contract,” the minister told in an interview with the Bulgarian TV channel Nova. He says it is inevitable to resume talks with Gazprom on gas supplies as alternative deliveries cost up to 50 percent more. Bulgaria has sealed a deal to secure 3 bcm of gas from Gazprom each year. So far it has received a third of contracted gas supplies. The government has proposed to extend the deal until either the end of the heating season or next summer. The energy minister said he did not believe that buying Russian gas meant funding of Putin’s Ukraine war. “We still buy Russian gas––but through intermediaries and we pay 30 percent more. Speaking of financing, Germany should stop buying Russian gas. Top European countries buy the same gas on these terms,” Hristov was quoted as saying. Russia’s ambassador to Bulgaria Eleonora Mitrofanova said in July that gas deliveries to Bulgaria could be resumed if there was a political will from Sofia, reiterating payments should be in roubles.",

    "Italy and Bulgaria: Europe’s big tests for Russian energy unity": "As Europe stares down winter energy shortages, votes in Italy and Bulgaria could test its resolve on Russian sanctions.\n\nEurope faces two choices this winter. The first is to accept gas rationing, causing likely major, lasting damage to heavy industry and hundreds of billions of euros in outlays to manage spiking energy costs and accelerate the energy transition. The second option is to accept Russian President Vladimir Putin’s destruction of the Ukrainian state and his plotting of future wars of aggression.\n\nOption two is, of course, wholly unacceptable. Yet Europe’s ability to stay united in rejecting it faces two imminent tests: elections in Italy on September 25 and then in Bulgaria a week later. In both countries, political forces that are more aligned with Putin than the rest of Europe could come to power, potentially threatening a cohesive front on the question of sanctions against Russia.\n\nLet’s be clear. Europe’s energy pain is the result of the economic war that the Putin regime is waging in tandem with its assault on Ukraine.\n\nMoscow isn’t even bothering to hide the fact any more. Whereas the Kremlin has historically denied any accusations that it uses energy as a political weapon – a ridiculous claim to any neutral observer – Putin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on September 5 said that gas flows would not resume through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline linking Russia and Germany with sanctions in place. It’s the single biggest source of piped gas from Russia to Europe.\n\nNever mind that Russia had originally claimed that the pipeline had gone offline at the end of August for repairs. With the pretence dropped, Putin threatened recently that Moscow would cut off energy supplies if the G7 proceeds with plans to impose price caps on Russian hydrocarbon exports.\n\nEurope must recognise that there is a reason the Kremlin is using its gas weapon more openly than ever before: It is losing both on the sanctions front and in the war in Ukraine.\n\nAccording to an internal government document accessed by Bloomberg, Russian experts and officials are predicting far deeper damages to the economy than Putin’s government is publicly acknowledging. Sure, sky-high hydrocarbon prices have meant that Russia’s headline GDP is unlikely to contract as much as some had expected, but its telecoms sector, pharmaceutical industry, machine tooling, civil aviation and even agricultural production are being ravaged.\n\nMilitarily too, the grinding advances that Putin’s troops are making in the Donbas are coming at a great cost. What was intended to be a lightning operation to decapitate the Ukrainian government, install a puppet regime and seize wide swaths of territory has turned into a quagmire. Gains in recent days by Ukrainian counteroffensives in Kherson and near Kharkiv are shattering what little remains of the myth of Russia’s military might. Meanwhile, Moscow has reportedly had to source drones from Iran and ammunition from North Korea.\n\nRussia’s supposed fraternal ally in China is unwilling to risk sanctions violations to supply it with weaponry, or to offer it access to credit. Beijing reportedly won’t even let Russia freely exchange the Chinese currency it has purchased.\n\nIt’s against the backdrop of this bleak strategic position that the Kremlin is trying to weaponise energy to the fullest extent. The Kremlin believes it can freeze Europe into climbing down on sanctions. The threat of a cold winter has already helped Moscow secure support from Hungary, which has expanded Russian gas purchases and is pressuring the European Union to lift sanctions on Russian oligarchs.\n\nThe big question: Will Italy and Bulgaria buckle next? In Italy, an alliance of right-wing parties is favoured to win a majority in the coming vote. It includes ex-prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, who remains a political force and was famously friendly with Putin. Though no longer in office at the time, his 2015 visit to Russian-occupied Crimea is the only time a former leader of a G7 state has visited the region since Putin annexed it.\n\nAlso a part of that coalition is Matteo Salvini, leader of the current largest party in the Italian parliament, Lega Nord. He too has previously praised Putin and in 2017 signed a cooperation agreement between the Lega and Putin’s ruling United Russia party. In 2019, a series of recordings revealed a close aide of Salvini’s discussing procuring Russian money for his party. He has openly called for “rethinking” the sanctions imposed on Russia amid the campaign.\n\nHowever, Georgia Meloni, who heads the ascendant Brothers of Italy party currently leading the polls, has endorsed the sanctions regime and said that she will stick by the EU and NATO in taking on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. Recent polls all show Meloni gaining more than half of the right-wing vote, and potentially twice as many as Salvini’s Lega. A Meloni-led right-wing coalition would certainly have other disputes with Brussels, but it appears she recognises that she can use support for Ukraine and the sanctions to buy room for concessions on other issues.\n\nWhat about Bulgaria? The reformist government of Prime Minister Kiril Petkov was among the earliest EU members to reject Russian gas following the invasion. Petkov’s coalition collapsed amid infighting in June.\n\nThe interim government appointed by President Rumen Radev – long an advocate of closer ties with Moscow – has been willing to hold talks with Gazprom about renewing gas supplies from Russia.\n\nPolls have only marginally shifted since Bulgarians last voted in November 2021, the third parliamentary election that year. However, Petkov’s party has seen support decline of late.\n\nMeanwhile, Radev’s ally Stefan Yanev, who favours a softer stance on Russia, launched a new political party that might cross the parliamentary threshold.\n\nAs Europe picks its political future, maintaining a united front on Russian sanctions is essential to ensure victory in the ongoing economic war. Bulgarian and Italian voters will soon have their say – and all of Europe ought to be watching.\n\nEditor’s Note: An earlier version of this article referred to a slight increase in the vote share of Bulgarian Socialists, when the latest polling shows their support has fallen marginally.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.",

It’s the largest economy in the world when you look at GDP. And it’s home to some of the richest people in the world. By all those measures of progress, the US is doing great. By other measures, however, things are not quite as rosy. The UN recently demoted the US to 41st, down from 32nd, in a global ranking based on its sustainable development goals. Like everything UN-related, this index is jargony and complicated, but essentially it is focused on the quality of life of ordinary people rather than the creation of wealth.

    "Unions urge Bulgaria govt to apply growth strategy for TCLF industries": "Employers and unions called on the Bulgarian government to come up with an industrial strategy to make use of the growth opportunities for the country’s textile, clothing, leather, and footwear (TCLF) industries. Even as the TCLF industries employ 80,000 workers in Bulgaria, employment has gone down by 20 per cent in the past four years which is a concern.\n\nIn the European Union (EU) Sustainable Textiles Strategy, TCLF industries are one of 14 industrial priority sectors, according to a joint press release by the European Apparel and Textile Confederation (EURATEX), European Confederation of the Footwear Industry (CEC), Confederation of National Associations of Tanners and Dressers of the European Community (COTANCE), and IndustriAll.\n\nEmployers and unions called on the Bulgarian government to come up with an industrial strategy to make use of the growth opportunities for the country's textile, clothing, leather, and footwear (TCLF) industries. Even as the TCLF industries employ 80,000 workers in Bulgaria, employment has gone down by 20 per cent in the past four years which is a concern.\n\nSocial partners discussed the challenges and opportunities of the new EU Sustainable Textiles Strategy and focused on both environmental and social sustainability. They agreed that for the strategy to be successful, all stakeholders must come together, and that a level playing field must be maintained between EU (Bulgarian) and non-European companies.\n\nIn the face of tough global competition, huge investment will be needed in both technology and people to ensure that the Bulgarian TCLF sectors can become greener and more digital. The modernisation of these sectors would also help the sector to become more attractive to Bulgarian workers, thus reducing the need to hire workers from abroad.\n\nConcerns were raised by national social partners, similar to other central and south European countries, that some young workers have opted to leave for Western Europe. Proposals to tackle this issue included ensuring better purchasing practices from major fashion brands whose suppliers account for over 90 per cent of TCLF production.\n\nThe social partners voiced their hope that with improvement in the purchasing practices of brands, changes in the behaviour of consumers and measures to ensure competitiveness that benefits could be felt by both the industry and the workforce.\n\nFOSIL-CITUB and FLI-PODREPA unions called for stronger social dialogue and sectoral collective bargaining. There has been no branch agreement since 2008, and existing company accords only cover 3-4 per cent of the sector. This is far from the 80 per cent coverage mentioned as reference in the upcoming European Minimum Wage Directive. As such, the unions have agreed to start developing a work plan to increase their leverage, added the release.\n\nEmployers wanted to have regulations to combat the grey economy and unfair competition. BAATPE and BATOK associations acknowledged that social partners must increase their representativeness to have a louder voice.\n\n“The message from trade unions in Sofia is clear: we need quality social dialogue and strong collective agreements to ensure a positive future for the TCLF industries in Bulgaria. The EU’s Sustainable Textiles Strategy offers a real opportunity if managed correctly, but investments — both in technology and the workforce — will be essential. This includes ensuring fair wages and good conditions to retain current workers and attract new ones,’’ said IndustriAll Europe’s general secretary Luc Triangle.\n\n“In a context where Europe puts more focus on quality, transparency, and sustainability, Bulgarian textile companies have a future. But they need support from the authorities to make that green and digital transition, and a constructive social dialogue, which ensures long term competitiveness of the industry,” said EURATEX director general Dirk Vantyghem.\n\n“Moreover, a particular focus and attention should be given to investments on skills and lifelong learning of workers. People are the main asset for the growth and competitiveness of the footwear and leather goods industries, and the education system in Bulgaria should be able to respond to companies’ skills needs. For that purpose, adequate curricula and related training programmes should be developed and education infrastructures made available by public authorities, in particular when it comes to vocational education and training (VET),” said secretary general of CEC Carmen Arias.\n\n“Leather producers in Bulgaria and all over Europe constitute a fundamental link in the world’s most demanding fashion value chains. They also play an important societal role, as they collect and transform a residue of the food and feed ecosystem into one of the most appealing textile ecosystem materials there is. For keeping generating wealth and jobs they need support from their public authorities for solving the problems of rocketing energy costs, unfair extra-EU competition, and a difficult labour market,” said secretary general of COTANCE Gustavo Gonzalez-Quijano.\n\n\n\nThe workshop was part of an EU-funded social dialogue project ’Ensuring a Sustainable Future for the Southeast European Textile, Clothing, Leather, and Footwear Industries,’ carried out in cooperation between European industry associations EURATEX, COTANCE, CEC, and IndustriAll Europe.

The delivery of the first F-16 fighters was supposed to be in 2023, but production was delayed two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe deal must be finally approved at the beginning of the mandate of the new National Assembly, but it seems likely to enjoy majority support. In the previous parliament, only the socialist party BSP and pro-Russian populist party “Vazrazhdane” were against purchasing the planes.\n\nBulgaria planned to purchase an entire squadron of 16 F-16 fighters to form combat-ready fighter aviation back in 2019.\n\nAt the moment, the country relies only on the Soviet MiG-29, of which no more than 7-8 aircraft can be used simultaneously. The Russian fighters can only be used until mid-2023, after which the country will have nothing to defend its airspace with until 2025.\n\nCaretaker Defence Minister Dimitar Stoyanov announced earlier this week that he was in talks with Poland on how to maintain the Soviet engines for the planes. Even if the negotiations are successful, the country will have to find replacement fighters until 2025. Bulgaria has already requested offers for replacement aircraft from the USA, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Israel.\n\n(Krassen Nikolov | EURACTIV.bg)",
    "Bulgaria to significantly increase national debt": "Bulgaria intends to take on at least €3 billion of government debt by the end of the year, of which €2 billion will come from the international markets, according to the credit calendar published by the finance ministry and the financial weekly Capital.\n\nThe Bulgarian government can borrow up to €5.2 billion. If this happens, the budget deficit of the country trying to adopt the euro by 2024 will reach nearly 7% of the country’s gross domestic product, which is twice the amount allowed for adoption in the eurozone.\n\nCurrently, the country’s fiscal reserve is low, and the government must finance a budget deficit of at least €3.1 billion this year. Inflation growth in Bulgaria continues to accelerate and in August reached 17.7% on an annual basis, according to data from the National Statistical Institute (NSI).\n\nThis is the highest inflation since May 1998, 18%. The costs of water supply, electricity and gas have increased the most – by 26.8%. Food has also risen in price drastically by 24.1%.\n\nThe price of transport increased by 22.8% along with that of solid fuels (69.1%), sunflower oil and cow butter (44.5%), and. automotive fuels (31.5%).\n\n(Krassen Nikolov | EURACTIV.bg)",
    "Bulgaria has potential to become European energy hub, says US’s Pompeo": "Bulgaria has the chance to realise its potential as an energy centre in Southeast Europe, former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday in Sofia.\n\nThe former secretary of state spoke at a lecture organised by the Confederation of Employers and Industrialists in Bulgaria (KRIB) on “The geopolitical significance of Bulgaria: After the invasion of Ukraine and Bulgaria’s potential as a regional energy leader”.\n\nAccording to Pompeo, the answer to the question of energy independence lies in Bulgaria itself, including through exploiting shale gas.\n\nAccording to the geological studies of American company Direct Petroleum, Bulgaria has deposits of at least 500 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas, with a large part of these deposits being shale gas, though Bulgaria’s annual needs only amount to 3 million bcm.\n\nThis means there are the deposits are enough for at least 1,500 years.\n\nGazprom stopped gas supplies to Bulgaria at the end of April, and the government has yet to decide where to get the necessary quantities for the winter.\n\nEight years ago, the Bulgarian parliament vetoed shale gas extraction and exploration under pressure from civil movements, including pro-Russian groups.\n\n“Modern shale gas extraction technologies are much cleaner than Russian gas,” Pompeo said.\n\nThe former secretary of state listed a series of Putin’s statements and actions that show he is working against the West, from his 2005 declaration that the collapse of the Soviet Union was the world’s greatest tragedy to the 2008 invasion of Georgia, the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nThe Taliban invasion of Afghanistan in 2021 was another green light for Putin to move forward with his plans to attack Ukraine, Pompeo added.\n\nRussia’s great weapon is not the army, which has turned out to be weaker than expected, but energy, which allows the Kremlin to exert influence, Pompeo also said.",

    "Bulgaria’s Caretaker PM: Russia's Actions are Unacceptable and Directly Violate the UN Charter": "“I will convene the Security Council to the Prime Minister next week, I guess on Thursday so that we can take concrete decisions and measures and be ready to react.”\n\nActing Prime Minister Galab Donev said this to the Bulgarian National Radio.\n\n\"The announced partial mobilization by the president of the Russian Federation leads to an escalation of tensions and to the fact that the countries in Europe and those that are close to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine do not have certainty about how long the military actions will continue and with what intensity they will be. Such an action by Russia is unacceptable, especially since it is a permanent member of the UN Security Council and should strictly observe the UN Charter and not threaten any other country with military force, which is a direct violation of the Statute of the Organization\", he said and emphasized again that there is a risk to Bulgaria's national security, but \"there is no direct military threat to our country so far\".\n\nIn his words, the uncertainty also comes from the disruption of energy supply chains for Europe by Russia:\n\n\"The gas issue is one of the leading ones in the EU and raises many questions about how Europe and its citizens will face the coming winter months\".\n\nFor BNR, the acting Prime Minister categorically emphasized that Bulgaria will not recognize the results of the referendums that are being held in the four regions of Ukraine:\n\n\"These referendums violate international law, they also violate the Constitution of Ukraine. We cannot under any circumstances accept results achieved in regions where hostilities are taking place. I am also completely opposed to intimidation with the use of nuclear weapons, no matter of the deterrent effect\".\n\nGalab Donev stated that Bulgaria supports EU sanctions against Russia to continue, but:\n\n\"The EU must do its analysis so that the sanctions do not have retroactive effect on the countries of the European Union. All the sanctions that the EU is yet to discuss in order to impose, we will insist that they go through a thorough analysis to see all the pros and cons of them\".\n\nAccording to him, the caretaker government has not slowed down with its position regarding Russia:\n\n\"There should be no hasty actions when we are in conditions of military operations, which are taking place in close proximity to the borders of Bulgaria\".\n\nOur positions are in sync with our partners in the EU and NATO, he pointed out categorically and specified:\n\n\"We firmly state that we do not support Russia's military actions in Ukraine. We are in favor of preserving the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine, that it has the right to free development, democratic development, as chosen by the Ukrainian citizens. We are firmly against the war and we have always insisted that solutions be sought through diplomacy\".\n\nOn the occasion of the wave of citizens leaving Russia, Donev said:\n\n\"This is more of a hypothesis for Bulgaria than a real fact. There must be a unified EU response to an intensified wave of refugees from Russia. No country could handle such a problem alone.\"\n\nThere is no refusal to negotiate with Gazprom, said the caretaker prime minister:\n\n\"I wouldn't say that there is a refusal, since we have an active contract, at the operational level there is no change in the situation. There is no development in the situation between Bulgargaz and Gazprom\".\n\nAccording to him, the demand for penalties for breaching the gas supply contract is a commercial relationship and should be resolved between the two companies - between \"Bulgargaz\" and \"Gazpromexport\".\n\nThere is great interest in the announced tenders for the supply of liquefied gas, the acting Prime Minister announced and added:\n\n\"At the moment, I have no information about Gazprom participating in the tender. There are quite a few companies that are interested. At the beginning of October, the tender for the November delivery will end.\"\n\nIn October, Bulgaria will participate in the tender for the Revithoussa terminal in order to secure slots and capacities for regasification and gas storage, Galab Donev also emphasized and announced that the Interconnector with Greece will enter commercial operation from October 1.\n\n\"Bulgargaz\" will also announce a contract for the gas hub \"Balkan\" and for the supply of pipeline gas. “We are looking for full diversification to provide competitive prices to businesses and citizens. In March, the tender will end and the conclusion of a long-term contract will be made by a regular government,” said the caretaker prime minister.\n\nFollow Novinite.com on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWrite to us at editors@novinite.com\n\nИнформирайте се на Български - Novinite.bg\n\n/BNR",

This is approximately 10% of Bulgaria’s electricity exports to neighbouring countries, which stabilises the electricity network in the region.\n\nThere will be an electricity export contract between the two countries, but there is no information yet on whether the prices will be lower than those on the free market.\n\n“We will unite with Bulgaria to find a solution for electricity supply,” said the Macedonian prime minister. He noted that North Macedonia did not have COVID-19 vaccines two years ago, and Bulgaria helped, now the country does not have enough electricity.\n\nThe two prime ministers discussed the possibilities for North Macedonia to store gas in the Bulgarian gas storage “Chiren”.\n\n“Bulgaria has traditionally been and still is an energy leader in the region to guarantee security in the Balkans sector,” said Bulgarian Prime Minister Galab Donev.\n\n“Specific opportunities for cooperation in the field of electricity and gas transportation were discussed, such as the possibility of exporting from Bulgaria additional electricity capacities, both for the needs of the economy and industry of the Republic of North Macedonia and for domestic consumers,” said Donev.\n\nThrough Bulgarian gas storage in Chiren, supplies of liquefied gas will be balanced for North Macedonia’s daily needs.",

    "Bulgarian president lobbies Lukoil to lower fuel prices – EURACTIV.com": "Bulgarian President Rumen Radev hosted a meeting between representatives of his caretaker government and the head of Lukoil Bulgaria, Vadim Vorobyov, on Thursday, where fuel prices were discussed. At the same time, the Russian company expressed concern over the European embargo on Russian oil.\n\nRadev thanked the representatives of Lukoil for the company’s role in the country’s economy as a significant employer and producer of fuel. Radev spoke mainly about the high fuel prices and identifying measures to reduce them.\n\n“I consider that your upcoming meeting with the Bulgarian government is a good opportunity, of course, strictly following market mechanisms, to identify measures to stabilise the economic environment and to fight inflation for the benefit of the Bulgarian consumer,” the president told the representatives of Lukoil, according to his press office.\n\nLukoil is subject to European sanctions following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Meanwhile, the caretaker government appointed by Radev has made a U-turn regarding big Russian business in the country and started talks on resuming gas supplies from Gazprom.\n\nAccording to Radev, high fuel prices are among the leading reasons for the rise in prices of all goods and services and lead to a contraction in consumption.\n\n“The development of the economy depends to a large extent on the value of the produced fuels, but also on the inflationary processes, which determines the strategic importance of the company for the Bulgarian economy, especially in times of crisis,” commented the president.\n\nLukoil owns the largest oil refinery in the Balkans through its company, “Lukoil Neftohim Bulgaria,” which for a long time did not pay profit tax in Bulgaria.\n\nThe Lukoil refinery in the port city of Burgas is the only refinery Bulgaria has. For years Lukoil avoided paying taxes by reporting significant losses, despite its massive turnover of more than €3 billion per year (in most years) and its dominant position in the market.\n\nBetween 2006 and 2020, there were only three years in which the company reported a profit (2007, 2016, and 2017). All other years huge losses were reported, for example, in 2020, when the company announced a loss of over €255 million and only a tiny profit.\n\nAs early as May, Bulgarian energy expert Vasil Nachev commented that the price of Russian Urals oil used by the Lukoil refinery in Bulgaria was $37 per barrel cheaper than Brent. The reason is the invasion of Ukraine, which made Russian oil problematic for Western companies. In Bulgaria, however, the price of Russian raw materials remained close to that of international markets.\n\nThe intermediary company in the oil trade for Bulgaria is the Swiss-registered company “Litasco”, which is a majority shareholder in “Lukoil Neftohim Bulgaria.” This is a company that buys crude oil from Russia’s Lukoil and sells it to the refinery in Bulgaria.\n\nBehind the three companies stands one owner – the Russian “Lukoil”. The goal of the broker is to buy cheaply and sell expensively, and the Bulgarian company actually works only on a piecemeal basis – i.e. refines oil. Thus, a larger part of the profit remains in Russia.\n\nAbout 60% of the fuels for the Bulgarian market are processed in the Lukoil refinery. The company owns nearly 70% of the warehouses where the fuels of competing companies are stored and have a very large influence in Bulgaria.\n\nLukoil’s Vorobyov explained at the meeting that the company will continue to conduct a dialogue with the Bulgarian government, and there are measures planned to maintain the stability of the Bulgarian economy. Bulgaria received a derogation allowing the import of Russian oil until the end of 2024.\n\nThe previous government planned that the refinery in Burgas would be adapted to work without Russian oil. In the meantime, it became clear that the caretaker government would make use of the derogation.\n\nThe reason is that many state institutions have framework contracts for fuel supply, in which Lukoil is either a contractor or a supplier to other fuel traders.",
    "Bulgaria struggles with gas supply after denying ruble payment for Russian gas": "Russia halted natural gas deliveries to Bulgaria in April after the government in Sofia refused to pay in rubles.\n\nBulgaria has been almost totally dependent on imports from Gazprom for most of its gas supply: the three billion cubic meter annual imports from Russia covered nearly 90 percent of Bulgaria's gas demand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor all the latest headlines follow our Google News channel online or via the app.\n\nSince then, Bulgaria has been struggling to find alternative options like Azeri gas or LNG gas from the United States to cover its needs.\n\nWhile large parts of the industry do not rely on gas, there are several big enterprises that are fully dependent on natural gas.\n\nExperts fear that sharp price hikes or lack of supply would force them to limit production or stop work and add to the economic woes.\n\nThe head of the Bulgarian Industrial Capital Association Vassil Velev estimates that a shutdown of these enterprises would mean that some 250,000 workers will lose their jobs.\n\nIn Bulgaria, the poorest among the European Union's 27 members, surging energy costs are forcing families to cut extra spending ahead of the coming winter months to make sure there is enough money to buy food and medicines.\n\nAccording to Eurostat, more than a quarter of the seven million Bulgarians can't afford to heat their homes - which is the highest number in the EU.\n\nHaving to choose between heating their homes and putting food on the table, many financially strapped households will be unable to keep their homes warm this winter and risk falling into energy poverty.\n\nStatistics show that even middle-income households could struggle to pay their utility bills.\n\nScarcely insulated buildings, low incomes, and surging energy prices are the main causes of energy poverty.\n\nIn Sofia, where almost half a million households have central heating, the number of those who decided to switch to other heating options jumped after the announcement of a 40 percent price increase.\n\nAcross the country, nearly half of the households use firewood in winter as the cheapest and most accessible fuel, but the rising demand and the galloping inflation have driven prices up above last year's level.\n\nAuthorities are trying to lessen the financial burden on low-income households, mainly pensioners and the unemployed, by providing an energy allowance to buy wood for their stoves.\n\nOther government-sponsored protective measures include export limits for wood-processing companies and regular deliveries of firewood for the domestic market.\n\nRead more:\n\nPipeline gas supplies to Pakistan are possible: Russia’s Putin\n\nUK to hold emergency mini-budget on September 23: Sources\n\nEU countries to ask UN rights council to monitor Russia: Diplomatic sources",

Goals and objectives of CCP malign influence Bulgaria has never been among Beijing’s foreign policy priorities, and the feeling has been […]\n\nPhoto: National flags of China and Bulgaria flutter on a lamppost in front of the Tian'anmen Rostrum during the visit of Bulgarian president Rumen Radev to China in Beijing, China, 2 July 2019. At the invitation of President Xi Jinping, President Rumen Radev (Radev) of Bulgaria is paying a state visit to China from July 1 to 5, during which he attended the 13th Summer Davos. The traditional friendship between the two countries has continued to grow. At present, the two sides have maintained close cooperation at all levels, achieving notable results in cooperation in areas such as economy, trade, agriculture, and deepened people-to-people and cultural exchanges, setting a good example for country-to-country relations. Credit: Credit: Oriental Image via Reuters Connect\n\nThis report is a part of #CCPinCEE, a series of reports published by the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) analyzing Chinese influence efforts and operations across the nations of Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nGoals and objectives of CCP malign influence\n\nBulgaria has never been among Beijing’s foreign policy priorities, and the feeling has been mutual. At the same time, China loops Bulgaria in with the European Union’s ambivalent support for US policy toward China. China’s objective is to build an influential pro-Beijing lobby and prevent Bulgaria from joining the group of China’s outspoken critics.\n\nSo far, Chinese efforts in Bulgaria have produced mixed results. Officially, their relations hit a high point in 2018, when Prime Minister Boyko Borissov hosted the 16/17+1 meeting in Sofia during Bulgaria’s EU Council presidency. The next year, at a meeting of Bulgarian President Rumen Radev and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, the two men agreed on closer ties via a “strategic partnership” between their countries. Recently, however, bilateral relations seem to be at a standstill. A couple of signs of Bulgaria’s declining interest were the relatively lower-level Bulgarian delegation that attended the virtual summit of the 16/17+1 initiative of economic cooperation, and the lack of government officials at Sofia’s public commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party in October 2021. The justice minister of the then-caretaker government sent a congratulatory statement to the event, which was organized by professor Zahari Zahariev, chairman of the national One Belt, One Road Association.\n\nThis cooling of relations coincides with disillusionment about Chinese investments in the country. Bulgaria received only 1% ($112 m) of Chinese financial flows into Central Eastern Europe from 2000 to 2020, putting it ahead of only Croatia.\n\nChina uses different tools to increase its clout:\n\nMedia and social media: The Chinese government spreads propaganda through social media and some Bulgarian-language online and print outlets that it owns or finances. For example, China Today (Китай днес) is a weekly newspaper covering Chinese domestic and foreign policy and bilateral relations, published by the same team that produces the Bulgarian edition of Russia Today (Русия днес). Other popular media websites include the Bulgarian-language China Radio International website and We Are China Facebook page.\n\nLeaders’ meetings in the framework of the 16/17+1 initiative for economic cooperation: The 16/17+1 summit in Sofia in 2018 concluded with memoranda for $1.75 bn in loans from the China Development Bank to small and medium-sized companies in Bulgaria, and investments in infrastructure projects.\n\nThe Cooperation between China and Central and Eastern European Countries (C-CEEC) Global Partnership Center in Sofia: Announced during the seventh C-CEEC leaders’ meeting in 2019, the center was to be situated within the Bulgarian Council of Ministers. It would offer consultation and advice to government agencies and businesses involved in the 16/17+1 economic initiative and “promote(s) the C-CEEC mechanism’s principles of openness, equality, fairness, and transparency.” There is no evidence of its actual functioning yet, perhaps due to the pandemic and a protracted political crisis in Bulgaria after March 2021.\n\nDevelopment of a Bulgarian-Chinese Innovation Center in Sofia: Sofia University has volunteered to host the center, which was agreed by the two countries’ leaders in 2018 and which would focus on information technologies and health sciences.\n\nParliamentary cooperation: The parliamentary group for friendship with China is popular among Bulgarian legislators, second only to the friendship with Russia group.\n\nExchange visits/bilateral meetings: For example, the Chinese Association for International Understanding (CAFIU), a Beijing-based institution of the Chinese Communist Party, has hosted several tours of China for Bulgarian leaders in fields such as academia, journalism, and business. It also regularly invites Bulgarian representatives to its international events and co-chairs similar Bulgarian-Chinese fora in Sofia.\n\nAcademic facilities: One of the main tools for reaching young people is the Confucius Institute in Sofia, the first on the Balkan peninsula and one of the first in Eastern Europe. Launched in 2006, it was designated a model for the development of Confucius Institutes worldwide in 2013. Other centers exist in universities across the country.\n\nContent-sharing agreements with local electronic and print media: 24 Chasa, one of the most widely distributed daily newspapers, regularly reproduces pieces from China Radio International. In addition, Bulgarian National Television has an agreement with China Central Television to air Chinese content on BNT 2 and its other channels, and the private TV-7 airs Chinese content.\n\nAgreements with professional organizations: Most notably, the Union of Bulgarian Journalists and the Chinese Union of Journalists agreed in November 2020 to launch a journalistic forum on solidarity and cooperation.\n\nBusiness lobbies and associations: For example, the Plovdiv-based Bulgarian-Chinese Business Development Association seeks to promote Bulgarian agricultural produce in China. In addition, a Bulgarian-Chinese Chamber of Commerce is active nationally.\n\nSources: The World Factbook 2022, (Washington, DC: Central Intelligence Agency, 2020), https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/; World Bank, The World Bank Group, 2022, https://www.worldbank.org/en/home; “Friendship Group Bulgaria – China”, National Assembly of The Republic of Bulgaria, retrieved June 27, 2022, https://parliament.bg/en/friendshipgroups/2189\n\nReach of influence measures\n\nGiven the fairly limited (albeit growing) direct economic footprint of China in Bulgaria, and in particular the lack of flagship projects by Chinese state-owned companies, the impact of Chinese soft and sharp power should not be overestimated.\n\nTarget audiences and populations\n\nChinese propaganda in Bulgaria is reminiscent of the rigid Cold War stylistics and content, yet one should not underestimate its efficiency and long-term impact. China’s main focus is on issues that are generally neglected since the Cold War but are particularly relevant in Bulgaria, the poorest country in the EU. Keywords and phrases such as “peaceful coexistence,” “poverty,” “equality,” “national sovereignty,” “non-interference,” and “social justice,” appear frequently in Chinese propaganda. They do not impress the local elites but they touch on the anxieties and priorities of ordinary Bulgarians, which could help explain why a 2020 Pew Research Center poll found that 55% of Bulgarians have a favorable view of China, a higher percentage than the other surveyed CEE and Western European countries.\n\nThose most vulnerable to Chinese propaganda tend to embrace euroskepticism and anti-NATO/anti-US sentiment. These are mostly either Russophiles or Bulgarian nationalists who support the Bulgarian Socialist Party or the “patriotic fringe” parties. As Chinese influence grows internationally, however, many politicians from other mainstream parties have flirted with joining the pro-China lobby. The parliamentary Bulgaria-China friendship group is one of the most popular in the legislature. And compared with other CEE parliamentary groups, Bulgarian members of the European Parliament are less critical of authoritarian regimes, including China’s. For example, only 10 of Bulgaria’s 17 MEPs voted for a European Parliament resolution condemning human rights violations against the Uyghurs in China, and only 11 condemned China’s crackdown on pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong. On the basis of these resolutions and others, the Political Capital think tank’s China-critical index puts MEPs from the Bulgarian Socialist Party among the most China-friendly mainstream parties in the European Parliament. The party’s votes are often out of step even with the Socialist and Democrats Group’s policy preferences.\n\nPhoto: Prime Minister Boyko Borissov and the People’s Republic of China’s State Council of China Li Keqiang at the opening of the 2018 16+1 Summit in Sofia, Bulgaria. Credit: Council of Ministers of the Republic of Bulgaria.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe trajectory in Bulgarian-Chinese relations mirrors the general shift in US/EU relations with Beijing. The Bulgarian government was initially a vocal supporter of some announced initiatives to benefit from investments under the One Belt, One Road initiative, since renamed the Belt and Road Initiative. But outside of some private-sector efforts, not much has materialized. In the absence of any substantial initiative as the 16/17+1 format peters out, old-style Chinese propaganda is unlikely to sway many Bulgarians. Yet, the general attitude toward China in Bulgaria remains positive, and the pro-Beijing lobby in the country remains strong, though with limited access to the mainstream political and cultural spectrum. The war in Ukraine has exacerbated Bulgaria’s political instability, with the country’s political elite divided over an approach to Russia. This leaves opportunities for China to try to win over the parts of Bulgarian society repulsed by the Kremlin’s brutal attack on Ukraine. Yet, however economically tempting, Chinese overtures to Bulgaria are likely to be met by a mainstream clearly focused on realizing Bulgaria’s EU-financed projects first.",

    "Bulgarians flock to Edirne for winter needs": "Bulgarians flock to Edirne for winter needs\n\nEDİRNE\n\nBulgarian citizens have flocked to the northwestern province of Edirne to meet their winter needs, everything from clothes to household goods, as traders in the city have been delighted to see the influx.\n\nAs the summer is over, Bulgarians have started to visit Edirne to buy clothing such as boots, coats, sweaters as well as household items like blankets and quilts before the winter arrives.\n\n“We bought shampoo, clothes and whatever we saw. We bought tomatoes, salad and potatoes,” said Musa Musalova, a Bulgarian tourist.\n\nMelek Bent, another Bulgarian visitor, said she also met the needs of her children in the city, while Yakup Yılmaz, another tourist, stated he is planning to do all winter shopping here.\n\nMeanwhile, traders in the city are delighted with the influx of Bulgarians.\n\n“There is a lot of density here as all the Bulgarians come to Edirne to get their winter needs,” said Yusuf Kul, a tradesman in the region.\n\nMetin Reze, another tradesman, stated their businesses have revived with the Bulgarian influx, adding that the tourists do the shopping for various kinds of trousers, tracksuits and boots.\n\nBulgarians, who could not travel to the city because of over-crowdedness at Türkiye’s borders in the summer, are expected to face the natural gas problem as Russia’s Gazprom halted gas flows to the country.\n\nA recent decision on July 27 allowed Bulgarian visitors to stay in the country for a maximum of 90 days on visa-free travel.\n\nThe move is designed to attract more tourists from the neighboring country, which will give a boost to the hard currency earnings of Türkiye.\n\nBetween January-May, nearly 950,000 Bulgarian nationals visited Türkiye, claiming the second spot on the list of foreign tourists after Germans. Bulgarians accounted for 8.3 percent of all foreign tourist arrivals.\n\nIn May alone, nearly 270,000 Bulgarians visited Türkiye.\n\nIn the first five months of this year, Edirne welcomed 1.3 million tourists, according to the latest data from the Culture and Tourism Ministry.",
    "\"Politico\": No Sanctions against Russian Nuclear Energy": "Nuclear energy is unlikely to be included in the next package of EU sanctions against Russia, Politico reports, citing several diplomatic sources. And Bulgaria is one of the reasons, it is clear from the publication.\n\nOver the weekend, the European Commission organized a series of meetings with senior diplomats to hear the proposals of the member states before the package is drawn up. It is expected to be introduced this week.\n\nThe pseudo-referendums in the 4 Ukrainian territories occupied by Russia and the discovery of a mass grave with over 400 bodies in the city of Izyum have convinced many \"doves\" in the EU countries that new measures against Russia are needed, the publication states.\n\nThere was also lunch with the permanent representatives of the Community countries, sources from Brussels confirmed to Club Z. But they did not want to give details.\n\nAccording to diplomats, nuclear power is unlikely to be part of the package, although Poland and the Baltic countries have drawn up a joint proposal on the issue for the first time. It includes targeted sanctions against Russia's nuclear industry.\n\nNuclear energy is a key sector in France, but also in Bulgaria, which exports electricity to Greece and the Western Balkans, notes Politico. The ban seems problematic mainly because of the difficulties it could cause for the maintenance of the nuclear plants built in Bulgaria during communism.\n\nThe most important factor in the call for new sanctions is the US push for a price ceiling mechanism for Russian oil exports agreed to by the G7 countries. Washington wants that mechanism to be in place by Dec. 5, when the ban on sea imports of Russian crude will take effect, diplomats said.\n\nOne of them points out that the Americans demand that companies be notified 90 days in advance of the introduction of price caps. And Europe is already late.\n\nThere is also resistance to the marginal price of oil. It comes mostly from Cyprus. However, it is expected that at least this point will enter the package and it will be finalized at the informal meeting of European leaders on October 6 and 7 in Prague.\n\nTwo of the diplomats claim that the package will also include controls on the import of diamonds, semi-finished steel, machinery and chemicals.\n\nSeveral countries, including the Netherlands, propose sanctions for people helping to circumvent the restrictive measures.\n\nFollow Novinite.com on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWrite to us at editors@novinite.com\n\nИнформирайте се на Български - Novinite.bg\n\n/Politico, ClubZ",

    "Bulgaria to increase Russian visa prices": "Bulgaria will increase the price of visas for Russian tourists from €35 to €80 following a decision taken at the EU level, announced the caretaker Minister of Tourism, Ilin Dimitrov.\n\nIn an interview with Bulgarian National Television, Dimitrov explained that the cost of a visa was €80 but had been discounted for Russians to just €35, but not for much longer.”This discount will disappear. There is no way to ban Russians from entering, but their visa will become more expensive. This is an EU decision with which we do not fully agree, but as members of the union, we will have to comply,” he added.\n\nOver 60,000 Russians have visited Bulgaria since the start of the year despite the lack of direct flights, suspended after Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February.\n\n“There are Russians by the sea. The Russians have about 100,000 properties along our Black Sea coast. They enter through Turkey, pay serious costs to land in Bulgaria, but still come,” Dimitrov said.\n\nDimitrov also explained that about 20,000 Ukrainian refugees are currently accommodated in Bulgarian hotels, and an attempt will be made to extend the government’s housing programme for the accommodation of Ukrainian refugees until the end of October.\n\nHe stated that his main task is to repay the hoteliers. They were paid first with money from the state budget before all expenses were covered by EU funding.\n\n“The spending of every single penny will be checked. When we are 100% sure there is no fraud, everything will be paid. At the end of the programme, there will be a period of 10 days, and anyone will be able to file a complaint. If there is a mistake, it will be corrected,” assured Dimitrov.",
    "The Lack of Firewood Imports from Bulgaria led to a Sharp Rise in Prices in Greece": "The lack of firewood imports from Bulgaria tightened the market in Greece and sharply raised prices, Greek media reports. The government is ready to put a price cap.\n\nGreece cannot cover the demand for firewood on the domestic market. Prices have almost doubled compared to last year, customers report. Due to the cold winter weather in Northern Greece in this area, the demand is the strongest and the prices are very high, traders commented to the media.\n\nGeorgios Papageorgiou, a dairy owner and wholesaler, told \"Open\" TV that imports from Bulgaria have been stopped. According to him, the reason is that in our country two companies have a monopoly on the firewood trade and sell at a very high price.\n\nTo contain the price crisis, the government is distributing free firewood to residents in the highlands of the country.\n\nDevelopment Minister Georgiadis said that this week a ceiling will be placed on firewood prices so that there is no speculation.\n\nFollow Novinite.com on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWrite to us at editors@novinite.com\n\nИнформирайте се на Български - Novinite.bg\n\n/BNR",
    "Russian ambassador in Bulgaria appears in front row, again": "Russian Ambassador Eleonora Mitrofanova to Bulgaria showed up close to President Rumen Radev at the culmination of the Unification celebrations in the city of Plovdiv on Tuesday (6 September).\n\nThe Unification is a national holiday in Bulgaria that commemorates the act of unification of the Principality of Bulgaria and the province of Eastern Rumelia in the autumn of 1885. The Russian Empire aggressively opposed Unification which is why the presence of Mitrofanova in Plovdiv was a surprise, given her attitude towards the Bulgarian authorities and the expulsion of 70 people from the Russian embassy in June.\n\nFurthermore, Russia declared Bulgaria an enemy country at the beginning of the war with Ukraine.\n\nHowever, after the government was ousted by a non-confidence vote and now a caretaker government appointed by the president is in power, relations with Mitrofanova warmed up.\n\nOn the celebration evening, she was standing among the honoured guests, very close to President Radev.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, the Russian embassy in Bulgaria published an angry post on Facebook about an attack on the monument of the Soviet army in Sofia’s city centre, the night before the anniversary of 6 September 1944, when the Soviet Union declared war on Bulgaria.\n\nIn recent months, the monument has been covered with red paint several times as a symbol of the blood that is being shed in Ukraine due to Russian aggression."
