    "What Ethiopia and Tigray need for peace talks to succeed": "An impartial mediator, political will and a fraction of the world’s attention that Ukraine has received would help.\n\nOn August 24, 2022, the wheels fell off an uneasy nine-month truce between the Ethiopian and Tigrayan governments, with an enormous military assault across dozens of fronts in Tigray.\n\nThe informal cessation of hostilities had been reached following the withdrawal of Tigrayan forces from the neighbouring Afar and Amhara regions in December 2021. In the ensuing period, both parties called for mediation to end the war, as the humanitarian situation in northern Ethiopia deteriorated.\n\nMediation efforts by the United States to revive the ceasefire in early September failed. The deadly war on Tigray – which has killed more than half a million people, left more than 5.6 million Tigrayans starving and displaced another two million – has flared up again. In some ways, the signs have been ominous for a while: The government in Addis Ababa had, at the start of August, refused to lift the siege on Tigray and had criticised a joint visit by envoys of the United Nations, US, and European Union to the region’s capital Mekelle.\n\nStill, a new window of opportunity for peace has emerged — if the parties to the conflict and bodies like the UN, which is currently meeting in New York, can utilise it urgently.\n\nOn September 11, 2022 – the Ethiopian New Year – the government of Tigray expressed its readiness to resume negotiations brokered by the African Union, effectively putting the ball in Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s court. Now, proactive mediation is needed to stop the entire region from being sucked into a greater abyss, save tens of thousands of lives and alleviate the suffering of millions.\n\nNegotiations between the governments of Ethiopia and Tigray will determine the future of both the region and the country. In the Horn of Africa, 66 million people are already affected by drought. The stakes for the international community are very high. What then can be done to revive the truce and build a permanent ceasefire? What needs to be done to ensure successful mediation?\n\nUnderstanding military realities\n\nOn one side of the war are Ethiopian, Amhara and Eritrean forces marshalling the resources of a population of more than 120 million with two sovereign states and their foreign allies providing military-grade drones. On the other side are the Tigray Defense Forces (TDF) representing the popular resistance of the fewer than eight million people of Tigray. Their war of attrition will reach the two-year mark on November 4, 2022.\n\nThe success of mediation efforts heavily depends on the military realities on the ground, the political will of the warring parties and the determination of the international community to end the war – as demonstrated by the diplomatic, financial, and other resources it deploys.\n\nFurthermore, the success of mediation also depends on the mediators and their strategies. That in turn will determine the process, structure and agenda for talks, how different issues at stake are prioritised and other key ingredients for negotiations. In this instance, the AU, as the lead mediator in consultation with other envoys, has yet to develop a clear strategy. That could be dangerous because discredited mediation leaves conflicts even more convoluted than before and reduces trust in the utility of such efforts.\n\nImpartial mediator needed\n\nFollowing the reservations expressed by Tigray over the current African Union (AU) envoy, former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, it is imperative that the organisation appoint other mediators acceptable to both parties.\n\nImpartiality is the cornerstone of proactive mediation. Former Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, who has been engaging both parties, was appointed by his successor, William Ruto, to serve as his country’s envoy for Ethiopia and the Great Lakes. The US, EU and others have endorsed Kenyatta’s appointment. The AU should consider swiftly appointing Kenyatta as its envoy to Ethiopia too, while Obasanjo remains the envoy for the Horn.\n\nCrucial next steps\n\nTo achieve military disengagement, it is critical to cease hostilities. This will allow a return to peaceful negotiations towards a ceasefire and transitional security arrangement. Unlike a mere truce, a ceasefire requires an overall agreement on the political agenda for the items of peace negotiations.\n\nThat agenda must include confidence-building measures, including unimpeded access to humanitarian aid and the immediate resumption of civilian transportation, electricity, telecommunications, banking services, salary payments, fuel deliveries and other items critical to survival for millions in Tigray. These are prerequisites for negotiations. Another confidence-building measure would be the release of prisoners of war and political prisoners, including Tigrayan members of the Ethiopian army and security sector.\n\nTo commence the process and prepare the ground for substantive and intricate politico-military negotiations, a Declaration of Principles – laying out parameters for the talks – should be made to guide the mediation process.\n\nNone of this will be easy. There are several thorny issues involved. They include demands from Tigray for the withdrawal of all non-TDF forces from all territories of the region, in effect returning to pre-war military positions. Ethiopia needs to recognise the TDF as the sole provider of security for Tigray and respect the will of the region’s people, including their right to hold a referendum within an agreed-upon time frame. Finally, there needs to be legal accountability before an international tribunal for atrocities established by the recent report of the International Commission of Human Rights Experts (ICHRE) on Ethiopia.\n\nInternational community involvement\n\nFinding agreement on these issues and bridging differences in a way that is anchored in respect for human rights will require unified international support for the mediation.\n\nEffective mediation, in turn, needs robust and coercive compliance mechanisms and enforcement measures against violators, including provisions for sanctions on selected individuals, regional travel bans, freezing of assets and exclusion from political office in future governance arrangements.\n\nThe war on Tigray resumed partly due to the failure of the pan-African and international community to take concrete measures to end Ethiopia’s siege of the region. The Ukraine war has deflected the international community’s resources, leadership and attention away from the catastrophic war in Ethiopia — and laid bare some glaring double standards.\n\nAfter all, in terms of magnitude and the humanitarian consequences, the conflict in Ukraine — while horrific — pales in comparison to the ongoing battles of attrition in Tigray, which have already claimed more than 500,000 lives.\n\nThe UN Security Council and the UN General Assembly must urgently discuss the situation in Ethiopia and deliberate on the report of the International Commission of Human Rights Experts on Ethiopia, submitted to the Human Rights Council in Geneva this week.\n\nJust a tiny fraction of what the Western world has so far spent in support of Ukraine’s resistance against Russia’s invasion could have stopped the war in the Horn of Africa, ending the suffering of hundreds of millions.\n\nFor peace to truly take hold in the region, the world needs to wake up. Now.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.",
    "Ethiopia: Civilians again mired in intractable and deadly war, Human Rights Council hears": "In their first, extensive report to the Human Rights Council in Geneva, the International Commission of Human Rights Experts on Ethiopia said that they believed that crimes against humanity had also been committed in the on-off war that erupted in the northern region in November 2020.\n\n#HRC51 | Commission of Human Rights Experts on Ethiopia told the Human Rights Council that it found reasonable grounds to believe that the parties to the conflict had committed serious violations & abuses of international human rights & humanitarian law https://t.co/w9dGB6qK4x pic.twitter.com/5OKpgw8Yei — UN Human Rights Council 📍 #HRC51 (@UN_HRC) September 22, 2022\n\nWorst rights violations\n\nSerious rights violations in Tigray were “ongoing”, the report maintained, noting that fighting resumed last month, breaking a five-month ceasefire.\n\n“Extrajudicial killings, rape, sexual violence, and starvation of the civilian population as a method of warfare” have happened in Ethiopia since the earliest days of the conflict, the Council heard.\n\nCiting information from “credible sources”, Commission chairperson Kaari Betty Murungi – who like the two other members of the panel is an independent UN-appointed rights expert - said that there had been an “escalation” in drone attacks by Government forces that used explosive weapons “with wide area effects in populated areas”, since hostilities resumed.\n\n“Our investigation indicates that their use has exposed civilians to new and heightened risks,” she said. “We have received reports of drone strikes in Tigray in the last four weeks, which have allegedly killed and injured civilians, including children.”\n\nTurning to Tigrayan forces, Ms. Murungi insisted that they had also likely committed serious human rights abuses “which amount to war crimes”.\n\nThese included “large-scale killings of Amhara civilians, rape and sexual violence, and widespread looting and destruction of civilian property in Kobo and Chenna in August and September 2021.\n\n“During their searches of homes in Kobo, for example, Tigrayan forces looked for weapons and pulled many men from their homes, executing them, often in front of their families.”\n\nDesperate conditions\n\nToday, international humanitarian access into Tigray continues to be blocked, despite the dire situation there, Ms. Murungi said.\n\nThere were reasonable grounds to believe that the Federal Government and its allies “looted and destroyed goods indispensable for the survival of the civilian population in Tigray, killing livestock, destroying food stores, and razing crops while also implementing severe restrictions on humanitarian access to Tigray”, she added, noting that for more than a year, six million people had been denied access to electricity, internet, telecommunications and banking.\n\nThis denial and obstruction of access to basic services, food, healthcare and aid relief “amount(ed) to the crimes against humanity of persecution and inhumane acts”, the Commission chairperson insisted.\n\nStarvation ‘tactic’\n\n“We also have reasonable grounds to believe that the Federal Government is committing the war crime of using starvation as a method of warfare,” the top independent rights expert continued, noting that Tigrayan forces had reportedly looted humanitarian aid.\n\nAccording to the latest dire humanitarian data from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), conflict and displacement in northern Ethiopia has left more than nine million people in need in Tigray, Afar and Amhara regions, while severe drought is affecting millions more in the south.\n\nCiting OCHA, Ms. Murungi said that that the combined effect of the Federal government’s measures had left 90 per cent of the population in acute need - an 80 per cent increase since the beginning of the conflict.\n\n“Most of the population in Tigray must now survive on limited and nutritionally inadequate diets,” she said, adding that there had also been “an increase in child marriages and child labour, human trafficking, and transactional sex as desperate means for survival”.\n\n© UNICEF/ Christine Nesbitt A child sits inside a vehicle burned out during fighting in the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia.\n\nTigrayan women and girls not spared\n\nAccording to the Commission chairperson, rape and crimes of sexual violence had happened “on a staggering scale” since the earliest days of the conflict, “with Ethiopian and Eritrean forces and regional militias targeting Tigrayan women and girls with particular violence and brutality”.\n\nTigrayan forces had also committed rape and sexual violence against Amhara women and girls and Eritrean refugees, Ms. Murungi said, highlighting the devastating long-term impacts for the survivors that included trauma, unwanted pregnancy and HIV infection.\n\n‘Unfair and biased scrutiny’\n\nRejecting the report’s findings, the Ethiopia delegation repeated its claim that the federal government had been subjected to “unfair and biased scrutiny” at the Council for more than a year.\n\nAddis Ababa was engaged in responding to an “insurrectionist armed group that has endangered the territorial integrity of the country”, the Council heard.\n\nThe international commission of human rights experts on Ethiopia was established after the Human Rights Council adopted resolution S-33/1 on 17 December 2021.\n\nIt mandated a panel of three human rights experts - appointed by the President of the Human Rights Council - “to conduct a thorough and impartial investigation into allegations of violations and abuses of international human rights law and violations of international humanitarian law and international refugee law in Ethiopia committed since 3 November 2020 by all parties to the conflict”.",

    "Tigray Nutrition Cluster Advocacy Note: Women and children in Tigray region, Ethiopia, in dire need of life-saving nutrition support - Ethiopia": "The Need\n\nAlmost half a million children are projected to suffer from wasting in 2022 in Tigray region, and it is estimated that 93,000 children could develop a severe form of wasting putting them at risk of death. A child suffering from severe wasting is nine time more likely to die than a well-nourished child. Children under 5 are currently already experiencing above emergency threshold levels of wasting (>15%) across several parts of the region with children aged 6-24months being the worst affected. The Tigray Emergency Food Security Assessment (EFSA) conducted in June 2022 reports that 29.4% of children have wasting and 5.8% have severe wasting using MUAC measurements. Other alarming figures are the levels of malnutrition in pregnant and lactating women (PLW) which range from 55-80% as shown by the find and treat campaigns results and the EFSA report (2022). The number of low-birth weight babies in hospitals has been increasing which raise additional serious concerns.\n\nResponse\n\nTo improve diets of children and prevent malnutrition in Tigray, Nutrition cluster members provide Infant and young child feeding education and counselling to pregnant and lactating women and caregivers of children focusing on the essential first 1000 days of life. Despite these efforts, the quality of the diets remains low, and this inflicts devastating damage in children, stunting children’s growth, impairing their brain development, and leaving them susceptible to diseases. Only 1.3% of the children are meeting their minimum acceptable diet which is an indicator that considers the diversity and frequency of meals. This is also linked to the food insecurity in the region where 89% of the households were classified as food insecure while 47% were severely food insecure.\n\nTo protect children’s right to food and nutrition in Tigray, from October 2021, UNICEF and its partners have spearheaded the find and treat campaigns in 79 accessible Woredas. In a propitious environment, the campaign could have reached the 79 woredas in just 1 month. However, due to lack of cash, fuel, and supplies, only 19 out of the 79 Woredas have been covered with the campaign to date. 9 additional Woredas in the western zone are currently inaccessible. The Find and Treat campaigns focus on screening of children and PLW for malnutrition, providing treatment for the malnourished while linking them with a follow-up health facility. Additionally, supplements to prevent vitamin and nutrient deficiencies are provided to women and children. The campaigns are also a platform for monitoring the nutrition situation of children in the Woredas since partners have not been able to carry out SMART surveys in the past two years. Also due to lack of phone or internet connection monitoring of the nutrition response has been difficult.",

The Envoy’s remark came shortly after Tigrayan authorities said that “Eritrean forces have launched full scale offensive in all fronts today,” and days after news reports emerged that Eritrea was “mobilizing” its military reservist.\n\nEritrean forces have launched full scale offensive in all fronts today-all the way from Tekeze through to Irob.

They are extremely concerning and we condemn them” Ambassador Mike Hammer said, adding that all external foreign actors should respect Ethiopia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and “avoid fueling the conflict.” The U.S. has been very clear and said it “repeatedly that we encourage those who are able to communicate directly with Asmara that this is extreme concern and must stop”, he said, and added that “the presence of Eritrean troops in Ethiopia only serves to complicate matters and inflame an already tragic situation.”\n\nThe U.S. has already said it “condemn[s] Eritrea’s reentry” into Ethiopia’s renewed militarized hostilities between the federal defense forces and Tigrayan forces which started on 24 August, becoming the first from the international community to confirm Eritrea’s active engagement in the renewed hostilities.\n\nEritrea’s invasion of Ethiopia’s Tigray regional state and its role in the war has been marked with reports of extreme atrocities, which both Ethiopia and Eritrea initially denied as “complete lie.“ However, in May 2021, Ethiopia admitted the involvement of Eritrean troops in atrocities against civilians, confirming several reports by media and human rights organizations, including the state backed Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC), which said “grave human rights violations and an attack against civilians in Axum city, Tigray region.”\n\nThis was further corroborated in a new report by the International Commission of Human Rights Experts on Ethiopia (ICHREE) to the UN Human Rights Council, which concluded that “there are reasonable grounds to believe that violations, such as extrajudicial killings, rape, sexual violence, and starvation of the civilian population as a method of warfare have been committed in Ethiopia since 3 November 2020,” and said members of the Eritrean Defense Forces (EDF) were among the perpetrators.

    "Ethiopia - Situation Report, 19 Sep 2022 - Ethiopia": "HIGHLIGHTS\n\n6,037 internally displaced people assisted to voluntarily relocate from Semera to Ab’ala. Semera displacement site has been effectively closed on 5 September;\n\nDespite renewed hostilities, humanitarian response has continued in accessible areas with the available stocks in Afar, Amhara and Tigray regions;\n\nMore than 59,000 people are reportedly displaced by floods in Afar Region and require assistance;\n\nMore than 16 million people in drought affected areas require multisectoral assistance at least until the end of the year, and beyond.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nSituation Overview\n\nMultiple man-made and natural crisis across different regions of Ethiopia continue to drive high humanitarian needs. As indicated in the 2022 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP), more than 20 million people will require humanitarian assistance and protection services until the end of 2022. The mid-year review of the 2022 HRP is being finalized and will also incorporate the recently released Drought Response Plan (1).\n\nFollowing the resumption of hostilities some three weeks ago, after a five-month generally calm situation in northern Ethiopia, the displacement of tens of thousands of people has been reported in parts of Afar, Amhara and Tigray regions. The situation continues to create higher humanitarian needs and further stretch the limited response capacity of humanitarian partners striving to deliver assistance to people in need.\n\nIn Afar Region, 6,037 IDPs have voluntarily relocated from Semera to Ab'ala, and the Semera IDP site has been effectively closed on 5 September.The relocation process had started on 16 August. Humanitarian partners continue to provide assistance to those relocated in their current location, including supporting health services and water infrastructure in Ab'ala. Voluntary relocation from another site in Semera and of internally displaced persons (IDPs) residing with the host community will be conducted once preparations are completed and if security situation permits.\n\nMeanwhile, new displacements continue to be reported due to the ongoing hostilities in Afar Region. Displacements are also being reported due to floods, withmore than 59,000 people reportedly displaced in Asayita, Afambo, Dubti and Mille in Zone 1 and Gewane, Gelalo, Amibara, Hanruka, Buremudaytu, Awash Fentale and Dulecha Woredas in Zone 3. Additional areas are at risk of floods. Some of the newly displaced people have received food, emergency shelter and non-food items assistance, albeit still very limited compared to the high needs. At the same time, some flood-affected areas remain temporarily inaccessible.\n\nIn Amhara Region, the hostilities are affecting communities in North Gondar, North Wollo and Wag Hemra zones among others. Debark in North Gondar, Kobo and Woldiya in North Wollo as well as Abergele and Sekota in Wag Hemra remain hard-to-reach for humanitarian operators due to the volatile security situation. Destruction of property and of civilian infrastructure has also been reported. In North Wollo Zone, Jara IDP site was reportedly looted and part of the existing infrastructure damaged or destroyed. On 30 August 2022, more than 30,000 IDPs who were sheltering in the site had left looking for safety as news spread about fighting reportedly nearing Woldiya City, which is located some 50 kilometers from Jara. Most of the IDPs have now returned to the damaged site where the Government and humanitarian partners have resumed the provision of food and water trucking services. Lack of fuel and intermittent access challenges, however, are limiting the response efforts.\n\nRegional authorities have recently set up six collective sites in Mersa Town in North Wollo Zone on 6 September to accommodate increased number of IDPs. At least 12,000 newly displaced people, mainly women and children, are taking refuge in the town. Following the findings of a recent interagency needs assessment mission to Mersa Town, partners are mobilizing food and non-food items for distribution to assist them. A mobile health and nutrition team has already been dispatched to the town.\n\nThe overall food security level is concerning with at least 5 million people considered food insecure in Amhara. The situation is particularly dire in conflict-affected areas in the region. Malnutrition levels in more than 80 per cent of these areas are high. The most recent Government nutrition hotspot classification published in March 2022 revealed 125 hotspot woredas across the region, of which 74 are Priority One for response. Blanket and targeted supplementary feeding as well as school feeding programs are ongoing, but due to resources' constraints, partners can target only 83 per cent of the targeted food-insecure people, including some only receiving an incomplete food basket (limited to wheat).\n\nFlooding has also been reported in several flood-prone areas in Amhara Region, including in North Gondar, South Gondar and West Gojam zones. The Regional Flood Contingency Plan estimates that more than 487,000 people will be affected, of which more than 29,000 are likely to be displaced across 32 woredas in seven zones. Food response is ongoing but with severe limitations due to resource constraints.\n\nSimilarly, in Tigray Region, hostilities continued to be reported in several parts with tens of thousands of people reportedly displaced and civilian property and infrastructure damaged. New conflict-induced displacements are expected around Adigrat, Mai Tsebri and Sheraro. Movements of humanitarian convoy along the Semera - Mekelle route remains suspended since 24 August, hindering the transportation of humanitarian supplies. The United Nations Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) flights, which had been flying between Addis Ababa and Mekelle twice per week and had recently announced the organization of a third weekly flight, also remains suspended since 26 August, hampering the rotation of humanitarian workers and the transfer of cash for humanitarian operations. Nevertheless, the distribution of humanitarian assistance continues in accessible areas in Tigray with the remaining available stocks in the region, including supporting health centers and hospitals medical supplies and cold chain equipment (freezers and refrigerators). Partners have also mobilized shelter supplies for 23,000 newly displaced households in Shire and Mekelle towns, while preparations are underway to receive new IDPs in Sebacare IDP site in Mekelle and Mai Dimu site in Shire.\n\nHostilities in parts of western, southern, and eastern Ethiopia also continue to drive humanitarian needs. Hostilities in western Oromia, particularly in the Wollega zones, have also led to an influx of displacement across the Wollega zones and into Amhara Region, particularly to Debre Birhan Town in North Shewa Zone. The latest insecurity in Somali Region continues to impede the drought response, particularly in parts of Afder and Shabelle zones, as well as partially in Liben Zone. Meanwhile in Siti Zone, people displaced by violence in recent months are receiving assistance. The displaced population is sheltering in Aydhidhi, Bediwayn, Caska and Garba sites. An inter-agency mission will be monitoring the ongoing response to gauge new needs as well as identify gaps.\n\nIn eastern and southeastern Ethiopia, the Government and humanitarian partners continue to mobilize resources to scale-up multi-sector lifesaving assistance to close to 17 million people living in drought-affected areas, but the needs still surpass ongoing response, where the drought continues to impact several essential and critical sectors. In addition to deepening food insecurity and rising malnutrition, school dropouts and protection risks are rife. At present, around 9.9 million people require food assistance, and 2.9 million children and pregnant and breastfeeding women require nutrition interventions until the end of the year. The education of 1.4 million children has also been disrupted due to drought-induced migration, school closure or communicable diseases. The health impacts of the drought are also rising, including measles and diarrheal cases.\n\nIn Somali Region,for example, the number of dysentery/diarrheal cases have shown an increasing trend in recent weeks, particularly in Afder, Dawa, Fafan and Shabelle zones. Overall, the number of diarrheal cases in the region has increased by 33 per cent compared to the same period last year. The Government and partners are implementing prevention and control measures, including increasing access to safe drinking water and sanitation, provision of drugs and overall support to health facilities. Overall, 11 million people in drought affected areas require health interventions until the end of the year. In SNNPR, even if water availability has improved following the good rains received during the summer/*Kiremt (*June-September) rainy season, water trucking support needs to continue in the chronically water-insecure areas such as Benatsemay, Dasenech, Gangatom and Hamer woredas of South Omo Zone; Wera Dijo *Woreda *of Halaba Zone, and Dugna Fango Woreda of Wolayita Zone.\n\nThe humanitarian situation is expected to deteriorate further in parts of drought affected areas with the reported fifth consecutive failed Deyr/Hageyarainy season (October -- December), according to most recent forecasts. The extent of the drought impact is captured in the revised Drought Response Plan (1) published on 8 September. This plan will serve to organize and monitor the drought response until the end of 2022.\n\nFootnotes\n\n1. Find link to the Drought Response Plan here: https://bit.ly/3S5zzYf",

    "S. Sudan, Ethiopia agree on joint project to link with Djibouti port": "By Tesfa-Alem Tekle\n\nSeptember 23, 2022 (NAIROBI) – Ethiopia and South Sudan have agreed to carry out a series of joint infrastructure projects that would eventually enable the latter to link with the port of Djibouti.\n\nThe agreement was reached on Tuesday after a high-level South Sudan delegation led by Vice-President, Taban Geng Gai, met with a group of Ethiopian Ministers led by Finance Minister, Ahmed Shide.\n\nEarlier, the two sides discussed ways how to enhance joint infrastructure connectivity projects.\n\nIn this regard, both sides agreed on ways to enhance their previously designed plans in the areas of road infrastructure, energy, telecommunications, water transportation, and other vital economic sectors with a view to creating integration for mutual benefits.\n\nPer the newly reached agreement, one of the key projects being prioritized was to undertake road projects with a view to boosting connectivity between the two landlocked countries.\n\nAfter the discussions, Ethiopia’s Finance Minister, Ahmed Shide, confirmed that the two sides have concluded a very important agreement in terms of advancing two road projects.\n\n“We comprehensively agreed to work on joint infrastructural connectivity that will overcome geographical barriers in terms of trade and logistics flows between our two countries and people-to-people relations.”\n\nCut reliance on Kenya’s port\n\nThe fresh agreement with Ethiopia comes only a few days after South Sudan announced buying three acres of land at the port of Djibouti for the construction of a facility to handle its import and export of goods as the landlocked country eyes an alternative route to cut high dependency on Kenya’s Mombasa port.\n\n“We have only been using Port Sudan and Mombasa but recently, we have decided to go to Djibouti and as I am speaking to you, we have landed in Djibouti,” South Sudan Minister for Petroleum Puot Kang Chol is quoted as saying by local media.\n\nThe minister said the land was procured by the Ministry of Petroleum for the purpose of exporting the country’s crude oil as well as using it on imported goods. If effected, the move will hit the port of Mombasa given that Juba is one of Kenya’s largest clients importing nearly all of its cargo through the Kenyan port. Rising costs Khartoum charges Juba for pipelines have also pushed South Sudan to eye alternative routes to export its crude oil to the international market.\n\nPort of Djibouti\n\nThe road projects will be given top priority to open up transportation so that connectivity of South Sudan will be enhanced via Ethiopia through the Djibouti corridor, the Ethiopian minister added.\n\n“These projects will be financed jointly and we have agreed to finalize the feasibility and preparations in terms of selecting a contractor so that the joint financing mechanism will be worked upon,” Shide said. The South Sudanese delegation, on its part, vowed to cooperate and work for the immediate implementation of the joint projects.\n\n“The agreed projects will be operationalized and put into consideration as soon as all the technical aspects are addressed,” said Michael Makuei Lueth, South Sudan’s Information minister said on behalf of the delegation.\n\nLueth said that it is worth mentioning that South Sudan, as a landlocked country, will benefit from the port of Djibouti using Ethiopia as a transport hub. “Trade can be facilitated by Ethiopia through the Djibouti corridor,” he said adding “We expect Ethiopia to support us so that we can grow and be as strong as Ethiopia is today.” the South Sudanese minister added.\n\nIn transport connectivity, river, fibre optics and transmission line connectivity has been agreed upon and the preparation to realize the agreement will commence right after this meeting, Ethiopian officials said. “As soon as the preparations are completed we will work together for resource mobilization and reaching out to development financial institutions as part of the Horn of Africa initiative” Shide added. Aviation Sector The two sides have also agreed to work on the aviation sector. “Ethiopia has massive experience in airport construction. With this capacity, we have also agreed to share our experience and work on a joint mechanism on aviation connectivity and development with the republic of South Sudan.” the Ethiopian Finance Minister told journalists. Peace Process Ethiopia will continue to work and support the peace process in South Sudan, the minister said. He noted that ensuring regional peace and stability are crucial for the two countries’ joint infrastructural development. “We have a very comprehensive political commitment and will to advance the cooperation between the two countries,” Shide added. The South Sudanese high-level delegation arrived in Addis Ababa on Wednesday for a three-day official working visit. Upon arrival at Addis Ababa Bole International Airport, the South Sudanese delegation was warmly received by Ethiopian Defense Minister Abraham Belay and Director General of African Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Fisseha Shawul, among other senior government officials.",
    "News: Fed. Finance Intelligence Service warns agencies, local actors to refrain from illegal money transfer activities": "Police in Ethiopia often announce the seizure of local currency illegally being transferred. Picture credit: Humera Police\n\nAddis Abeba – The Ethiopian Finance Intelligence Service (FIS) has warned agencies and local actors it accused of involving in illegal money transfer activities to refrain from their activities.\n\nIn a statement it issued via state media, FIS, a federal institution established to coordinate various institutions involved in the fight against money laundering, financing of terrorism and proliferation of financing crimes, among others, said “some entities” were “carrying out money transfer under the guise of legal money transfer,” depriving Ethiopia of the foreign currency that it should be getting from various sources and committing financial crimes and keeping away the foreign currency Ethiopia needed to get “in foreign countries.”\n\nThe warning came in the backdrop of a never before seen gap in foreign currency exchange rates between the official and the informal market attributed to shortage of foreign currency. According to media reports last week, the Ethiopian birr being “traded as high as 92 a dollar on the black market.”\n\nFIS accused some money transfer agencies based abroad of keeping their deposits outside of Ethiopia and making payments in Ethiopian Birr “by colluding with their accomplices in Ethiopia and avoiding the foreign currency that should be legally brought into Ethiopia.”\n\nIn particular, FIS named agencies called ‘Adolis’, ‘Shege’, ‘Salam’, and ‘Red Sea’ that it said were involved in money transfer activities abroad and accused them of preparing and using fake receipts to pretend that they had sent foreign currency to Ethiopian banks, which should have been legally brought into Ethiopia. But in reality FIS blamed them of retaining the forex in foreign banks and |exacerbating the cost of living” in Ethiopia.\n\nFIS further said that it’s information indicates that these money transfer agencies were making payments in Birr assisted by more than 600 financial sources from their associates based in Ethiopia.\n\n“These entities are causing damage to Ethiopia’s financial system by allowing money that should have entered Ethiopia legally to be used for various criminal activities including contraband,” state media referred FIS’s statement as saying.\n\nThe federal Service has announced that it will continue its work with local stakeholders and partner institutions in foreign countries to hold those who commit such financial crimes, including illegal money transfer activities, and their accomplices involved in the act accountable by law and warned the actors and their local accomplices who participate in such activities knowingly or unknowingly to refrain from their actions.

    "Ethiopia: Humanitarian crisis fuels hardship for people with disabilities in Afar": "Getachew Gesese sits on a cemented edge of a flower bed, under a flagpole in front of a hotel in Semera, the capital of Afar region in Ethiopia. Next to him is his friend, Shegaw Ababu. A friend with whom he shares a similar disability and challenges. They have both lost their ability to walk. A dog with its ribs running against its belly like a bell stares at them with its tongue out of its mouth, as they beg for money from passersby.\n\nGetachew is a 20-year-old man who lives in Logia, a small town 10km outside of Semera. He lost his ability to walk 10 years ago. The condition forced him to abandon school and his dream of becoming an orthodox priest – in a region where over 95% of the population is muslim.\n\n\"When it started, I felt severe cramps and difficulty stretching my legs,\" says Getachew.\n\nAlthough his mother massaged his legs for months with traditional herbs, Getachew's condition got worse, and he could no longer walk. He did not seek medical diagnosis and treatment because his family could not afford it.\n\n\"Everybody also said there is no treatment for it,\" he adds.\n\nWith his physical disability, Getachew says he cannot get a job. He lives in a poor neighbourhood in Logia and depends on donations from people on the streets for survival. In the past, he could make 700 Ethiopian Birr on a good day. But since the war in northern Ethiopia spread to Afar region in 2021, he hardly makes 200 Birr. Some days, there is nothing to eat at home. And on several occasions, his landlord has thrown him out of the one room he rents – for days - and then will feel pity for him and allow him to stay without paying.\n\n\"It's tough now, especially for us who cannot walk,\" says Getachew.\n\nThe humanitarian needs in Afar are huge. Many people living with disabilities do not have access to medical services. There is no functional physical rehabilitation center in the region to provide full services to persons with special needs. The conflicts and violence in neighbouring Tigray, Amhara, Somali and Oromia regions have made it even more difficult for patients to access care elsewhere.\n\nOur region is different because it is facing a severe humanitarian situation from four conflicts\n\nsays Ali Zeinu, head of Afar's social affairs bureau.\n\nAt Dubti Referral Hospital – the largest in the region – doctors say the hospital is strained because of the dire humanitarian situation exacerbated by the different armed conflicts in neighbouring regions. Patients are being treated on beds in the hospital's corridors and several others are in queues waiting to be seen by medical staff. Among them are persons with different forms of physical disabilities. Some of them lost their legs and arms in the conflicts.\n\n\"Many patients with physical rehabilitation needs come here. Most of them are from very distant and remote areas. We can only provide basic services because we do not have the resources. We need assistance to improve our physiotherapy services,\" explains Dr. Hussein Aden, Chief Executive Officer of Dubti Referral Hospital. According to him, the hospital lacks equipment and is seriously understaffed. It also lacks critical services like mental health and ophthalmology.\n\nThe region also faces a food crisis. There is not enough food for people to eat. The influx of displaced people from nearby regions has added to the number of people who cannot access food. Malnutrition cases are rising. At a makeshift feeding centre in Dubti hospital, dozens of children and adults are getting therapeutic support for malnutrition and its complications. At the Mille Primary Health Center, which is some 60km on the outskirts of Semera, health experts weigh dozens of malnourished children at a nutrition center before providing them with essential therapeutic nutrition. Some of them arrive in desperate conditions.\n\nThe food shortage has left some people with no choice but to eat the seeds of certain legumes (genus lathyrus) that have irreversible health consequences – including permanent disability. Like many other people in the region, Getachew suffers from neurolathyrism – a lasting lower limbs paralysis condition caused by eating certain legumes, as diagnosed by physiotherapists from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), after screening patients in Afar region in August 2022.\n\n\"I ate guaya (grass pea). Three days after, I started having cramps, fatigue and difficulty stretching my legs,\" recalls Getachew.\n\nThe ICRC team's outreach activity was the first in the region for persons with disabilities. A total of 104 patients were screened in Logia, Mille, Dubti and Semera. Twelve of the patients were diagnosed with neurolathyrism as the underlying cause of their disability – including Getachew's 29-year-old friend, Shegaw.\n\nShegaw, 29, lost his ability to walk 10 years ago. Without medical care, he finds it very hard to cope with the disability.\n\n\n\nBut since meeting our physical rehabilitation team in Logia, he is hopeful his condition will get better. He is among 104 patients screened in #Afar region pic.twitter.com/hlde7f7NtW — ICRC Ethiopia (@ICRCEthiopia) September 7, 2022\n\n\"Looking at the number of neurolathyrism cases and the age range of the patients, their condition is likely linked to the food crisis in Ethiopia in the 1980s that forced people to eat certain legumes, knowing the health consequences. The Afar region, where we identified these patients, and the eastern Amhara region were severely affected by this food insecurity,\" explains Venkatakannan Packirisamy, ICRC's Physical Rehabilitation Project Manager in Ethiopia. \"The current food situation needs timely action to prevent many more people from being pushed into this irreversible health condition. Apart from the acute social and health-related consequences, the food insecurity leaves a longer-term legacy in terms of disability and productivity of the affected population.\"\n\nLike Getachew, most of the people living with disabilities in Afar have never had the chance to consult a medical doctor or physiotherapist.\n\n\"This [screening by the ICRC team] is my first time to meet a medical professional,\" says Shegaw. \"If I can be treated, I'll be very happy to walk again.\"\n\nAfter the screening, the ICRC team provided immediate support that included crutches to 61 patients on the spot, while 13 others were registered to receive wheelchairs to aid their mobility. Severe cases were referred to the physical rehabilitation center in Dessie, Amhara region, supported by the ICRC and to hospitals in the capital Addis Ababa, where they will receive free treatment.",
    "Fighting Erupts Again in Ethiopia’s Northern Tigray Region": "U.S. Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa Mike Hammer returned to Ethiopia, 12 days after fighting resumed between federal forces and Tigrayan rebels, breaking a monthslong cease-fire. The renewed clashes have quashed hopes for peace talks and threaten to spread the conflict, following reports that Eritrean forces have reentered the war and fighting is reported near the Sudan border.\n\nHammer arrived in Ethiopia on Sunday.\n\nIn a news release, the U.S. State Department said Hammer was planning to meet with politicians and civil society groups, “to discuss how best to promote efforts towards a lasting peace, security, and prosperity for all people in Ethiopia.”\n\nHammer last visited Ethiopia and met with officials in July, during the cease-fire, which the U.S. government said it found encouraging. However, he was told by Ethiopia’s Deputy Prime Minister Demeke Mekonnen that the country remains committed to African Union mediation of any peace talks.\n\nThe visit comes after fighting in the near two-year conflict between the Ethiopian federal government and rebels with the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) resumed August 24, ending the five-month cease-fire.\n\nThe U.S. has condemned neighboring Eritrea's reentry into the conflict, an offensive by the TPLF, and airstrikes by the Ethiopian government, which hit civilian areas, including a kindergarten.\n\nBefore the fighting resumed peace talks looked possible, with the TPLF favoring mediation by the U.S. and Kenya’s government, while the Ethiopian government looked to the African Union to broker talks.\n\nWilliam Davison, an analyst with the International Crisis Group, a Belgium-based political analysis firm, said stability in Ethiopia is of great concern to the U.S.\n\n“Above and beyond the desire to bring about peace because of its intrinsic benefits to Ethiopia because of the devastation the conflict is causing,” Davison told VOA, “the U.S. is of course concerned about the regional and geopolitical implications of increasing instability in Ethiopia, a critical country in the Horn of Africa, which is an important strategic reason itself.”\n\nDavidson said Washington can’t force the parties to the negotiating table.\n\n“At this point the U.S. probably doesn’t have, immediately, any extra leverage to bring to bear,” he said. “Of course, it has the diplomatic access and can implore the parties to recommit to the truce and try and achieve talks, but for the moment, the momentum has moved away from any sort of punitive measures. They did establish a sanctions regime.”\n\nAmong some Ethiopians on social media, there have been accusations the U.S. is biased toward the TPLF.\n\nKiram Tadesse, a pro-government commentator, holds that point of view.\n\n“The United States and the so-called international community are not impartial and even defend the TPLF, whenever the federal forces and other allied forces launched their offensive against TPLF,” Tadesse said. “There is a clear dissatisfaction among the social media users.”\n\nEthiopian state and state-controlled media also frequently parrot this view.\n\nVOA reached out to the TPLF and Ethiopian government with requests for comment on the arrival of the U.S. envoy, but neither responded.\n\nIn Tigray, humanitarian organizations say parts of the region are likely in a state of famine due to a lack of humanitarian aid being allowed in. The government has also shut down telecoms and banking there.\n\nWith clashes looking set to continue, it remains to be seen whether anyone can persuade the sides to open peace talks.",
    "A Wounded Ethiopia": "Last month, Ethiopia’s Tigray conflict resumed after months of truce, once again bringing desperately-need humanitarian aid flows to a halt and drawing in neighboring Eritrea’s armed forces. The return of outright hostilities in Tigray has prompted more intense international efforts to get a peace process on track, including the deployment of U.S. Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa Mike Hammer to the region for intensive talks with the parties to the conflict. External actors who desire stability in the Horn recognize that neither of the main antagonists can decisively defeat the other.\n\nThe setback in Tigray came in the context of escalating civil conflict in multiple parts of the Ethiopian state, from Afar and Oromia to Benishangul Gumuz and Gambella. Questions about the capacity of the Ethiopian government to provide security throughout the country have grown more urgent. An incident in July in which al-Shabab fighters crossed into Ethiopia from Somalia to stage attacks, suggests that they perceived Ethiopia to be both weakened and distracted. It’s difficult not to get a sense that the government in Addis Ababa, which has little economic room to maneuver, has no real long-term strategy for coping with these multiplying crises.\n\nIronically, Prime Minister Abiy initially rallied domestic and diaspora support for his scorched-earth tactics in Tigray by framing the conflict as one in which Ethiopia’s sovereignty and right to self-determination was a stake. But as his government becomes overwhelmed by security and economic struggles on multiple fronts, it becomes an ever-more appealing target for international opportunists of all stripes, from organizations like al-Shabab to governments that can offer some short-term relief in the form of economic support and weapons, even as they build long-term leverage and influence. In the geostrategically vital Horn of Africa, Ethiopia has gone from a power that shaped the contours of regional dynamics to a state cobbling together reactions to the forces affecting it. The outcome is precisely the opposite of the one that Ethiopian nationalists seek. If the state can avoid collapse, it may be far more beholden to outsiders than just two years ago.\n\nAfrica in Transition Michelle Gavin and other experts track political and security developments across sub-Saharan Africa.

Instead, the Horn of Africa grows more unstable, malign actors like Eritrea are emboldened, and the horrifying human costs of a manmade famine in Tigray lay bare the international system’s dysfunction. In the face of fierce Ethiopian resistance to UN Security Council involvement, the supposed guarantors of international peace and security have been unable to meaningfully address the Tigray issue, despite its interstate dimensions and collective international efforts to place humanitarian siege strategies beyond the pale of acceptability globally.\n\nA ray of hope emerged on Sunday, when Tigrayan forces indicated they were prepared to enter into a mutual cessation of hostilities agreement and participate in African Union-led talks without delay. This announcement creates a new opportunity to build positive momentum toward an end to the Tigray crisis. Whether real progress toward lasting peace will materialize remains to be seen, but what is not in doubt is just how difficult the outlook for Ethiopia will be without it.",

    "The Art of Dominance: biased UN system perpetuates conflict in Ethiopia": "Aklog Birara (Dr)\n\nPart 10 of 14\n\nIt has been clear to me since TPLF colluded with Ethiopia’s foreign adversaries and initiated its treasonous war in November 2020 that the European Union (EU), the US and UN Specialized institutions such as the Human Rights Council as well as the UN Security Council will be unrepentant in showing favoritism by dominating the international narrative and by exercising unabashed dominance concerning the causes, pains, and possible outcomes of the war in Ethiopia.\n\nBehind this unrepentant one sidedness and flawed Western position on Ethiopia and Eritrea is deliberate Western pressure on Ethiopia and the rest of Africa to choose between the potentially explosive struggle between the USA/EU on the one hand; and China, Russia, and the rest on the other. Sadly, the UN system is unable to play its neutral and impartial role.\n\nIt is my contention in this commentary that the UN Human Rights Council dominated by the West has become a misnomer. Its name no longer represents truth, impartiality and or justice. Eurocentric to its core, the Council’s pronouncements are heavily politicized and pro-West. This is true regarding its repeated claims, assessments and conclusions concerning human rights violations, atrocities and socioeconomic destruction caused by the TPLF. The Council singles out the victims, namely, Eritrea and Ethiopia as victimizers. It never refers to TPLF atrocities in Mai-Kadra in November 2020 and Mai-Kadra like atrocities perpetrated by TPLF since then.\n\nThe UN Human Rights Council took advantage of this year’s UN Annual General Assembly deliberations in New York. In a seamlessly synchronized parade of fake news and propaganda blitz, the Council lodged formal complaints from Geneva against Ethiopia. On September 22, 2022, the Council quoted so-called International Commission of Human Rights Experts on Ethiopia that “Ethiopia’s people are once again “mired…in the intractable and deadly consequences” of conflict between Government troops and forces loyal to Tigrayan separatist fighters, who are all responsible for war crimes.”\n\nIt is true Ethiopians are “mired” in a death trap. It is equally true human atrocities are caused by the TPLF that initiated its third people’s war on August 24, 2022. Neither the “Experts” nor the Council identified the primacy causes of continued atrocities let alone condemn the culprit and its foreign backers. “The Commission of Human Rights Experts on Ethiopia told the Human Rights Council that it found reasonable grounds to believe that the parties to the conflict had committed serious violations and abuses of international human rights and humanitarian law.”\n\nI believe both the Council and the Commission of Human Rights Experts that includes a prominent African on Ethiopia that the Council charged to conduct violations failed to conduct due diligence. For example, they did not acknowledge the fact that the government of Ethiopia had declared a unilateral ceasefire while the TPLF had failed to do so. The “five -month ceasefire” had offered ample opportunity for TPLF to reciprocate. Instead, TPLF amassed more fighters, including child soldiers, received more lethal weapons from foreign sources, diverted foods and fuels from humanitarian agencies like the World Food Program. In effect, declarations and pronouncements by the UN system emboldened the TPLF and made it more reckless.\n\nWestern monopoly on truth\n\nThere is a plethora of material evidence for the Council to hold TPLF accountable for war crimes, crimes against humanity and economic crimes. It chose not to revert to truth for geopolitical, strategic, and political reasons. The reader must ask “What is the motive behind treating the terrorist and treasonous TPLF at par with the government of Ethiopia?”\n\nThe Council and its Commission of HR Experts on Ethiopia failed regarding the impartiality test too. Let me give the Council and its experts the benefit of the doubt that both believe in the core principle that each person’s life matters in Ethiopia, and further believe that a “Rwanda-like scenario is unfolding and must be prevented.” If true, why fail to recognize the following facts perpetrated by the TPLF and its backers:\n\nRecruitment and deployment of child soldiers by TPLF is a crime for which it must be held accountable. It also demonstrates TPLF does not believe in peace or stability.\n\nCapturing and diverting humanitarian aid including food is a crime for which TPLF must be held accountable. Humanitarian aid agencies have an obligation to recognize the TPLF and not the government of Ethiopia has weaponized starvation in Tigray.\n\nExpanding the war to the Afar and Amhara regions as well as to Eritrea caused and still causes instability, human atrocities, and economic destructions by TPLF for which it must be held accountable. A conflict-ridden Ethiopia destabilizes the entire Horn and TPLF is the culprit.\n\nSealing off Tigray from independent international public scrutiny and forcing Tigrean mothers to deliver their children to TPLF’s asinine war killing machine with the consent of the EU, USA, and the UN system is a core part of war crimes that the Council and Experts are unwilling to consider.\n\nIt is patently false and immoral for the Council and its well-paid HR Experts on Ethiopia to claim that non-Tigrean Ethiopians: Fano, Amhara and Afar Special Forces, Ethiopia’s National Defense Forces as well as Eritreans have targeted or are targeting Tigreans and are committing genocide. The Federal Government of Ethiopia is not deploying child soldiers. TPLF is. Thousands of child soldiers are dying. Communities treat those who surrender more humanely than the Council and the Experts are willing to admit. The Experts reported to the Council “Extrajudicial killings, rape, sexual violence, and starvation of the civilian population as a method of warfare.” There is no independent and credible evidence to support this allegation.\n\nThe Experts took the TPLF unfounded narrative of the use of drones and the dropping of explosives on the civilian population in Tigray and declared these as facts. UN-appointed HR Expert leader Kaari Betty Murungi says “Our investigation indicates that their use (drones) has exposed civilians to new and heightened risks…We have received reports of drone strikes in Tigray in the last four weeks, which have allegedly killed and injured civilians, including children.”\n\nEthiopia is fighting for its very existence. It is legitimate for Ethiopia to use drones in defense of the country’s sovereign rights and to protect its territorial integrity with utmost caution concerning civilians.\n\nTo give credence and balance to her allegations, Ms. Murungi insisted that they (Tigrean forces) had also likely committed serious human rights abuses that amount to war crimes: large-scale killings of Amhara civilians, rape and sexual violence, and widespread looting and destruction of civilian property in Kobo and Chenna in August and September 2021.”\n\nI agree with Ms. Murungi that “During their searches of homes in Kobo, for example, Tigrayan forces looked for weapons and pulled many men from their homes, executing them, often in front of their families.” They raped girls and women in front of their spouses and families.\n\nHowever, the Experts failed short by not documenting and or reporting the scale of TPLF rapes, slaughters of innocent Afar and Amhara, thefts, lootings, and the immense destructions of social and economic infrastructure in successive wars conducted by the TPLF that will take billions of dollars in investments and decades to rehabilitate and reconstruct. Their report is deliberately partial and partisan.\n\nThe Council places greater burden on the Federal Government of Ethiopia. Experts including Ms. Murungi weighed in by declaring the Federal Government and its allies “looted and destroyed goods indispensable for the survival of the civilian population in Tigray, killing livestock, destroying food stores, and razing crops while also implementing severe restrictions on humanitarian access to Tigray.” These well documented atrocities by Ethiopian sources were in fact committed by the TPLF and not by Ethiopian Federal and allied forces. The most compelling evidence is that the Federal Government of Ethiopia declared a unilateral ceasefire and gave peace a chance. Why did the UN system fail to demand reciprocity?\n\nThe Experts flipped the accusation and placed unjustified and unwarranted blame on Ethiopian Defense and allied forces. They failed to recognize an internationally recognized and accepted mandate that Ethiopian and allied forces have a Constitutional obligation to defend the safety and human security of Tigreans, Amhara, Afar and other Ethiopians from the mayhem inflicted on them by TPLF. How come principles that apply in Europe do not apply in Africa.\n\nYou cannot restore basic human services like “electricity, internet, telecommunications and banking” when you are cognizant that TPLF destroys them and blames it on the governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea. The Experts and the Council know well that TPLF destroys social and physical facilities (hospitals, schools, bridges, roads, electric grids etc.) and blames it on Ethiopian and Eritrean forces repeatedly. TPLF diverts international humanitarian food and medical supplies and weaponizes the gaps deliberately and repeatedly without a modicum of challenge from the UN system. It accuses the Federal Government of Ethiopia that it is starving Tigreans and forcing TPLF to surrender without due diligence. Quoting TPLF and its diehard supporters is hardly due diligence. “We also have reasonable grounds to believe that the Federal Government is committing the war crime of using starvation as a method of warfare.” I wonder why the Experts dd not interview the thousands of Tigreans who either surrendered or captured. hosted and treated most humanely by Afar and Amhara communities.\n\nIn summary:\n\nIt astonishes me that Ethiopia is not fighting solely a terrorist group. It is also fighting a biased, partisan, and politicized UN system.\n\nIt astonishes me because Ethiopia is a founding member of the UN and hosts the African Union. Yet, the Council treats Ethiopia like a pariah.\n\nIt astonishes me that Ethiopia contributes its share in the fight against terrorism, but the UN system does not give it support in its fight against the terrorist TPLF.\n\nIt astonishes me that the Eurocentric and Western dominated UN system of which the Council is a core part criticizes one of the most ancient countries on this planet for defending its sovereignty and territorial integrity while giving a differential treatment to Ukraine.\n\nIt astonishes me that the UN Human Rights Council and its Commission of HR Experts on Ethiopia can get away with “unfair and biased” reporting at a time when the General Assembly of the United Nations is in session. It is hardly coincidental that the Experts submitted this pro-terrorist TPLF report with intent that the entire world would buy into it.\n\nTo say the report by the UN Human Rights Council based on its high-powered Commission of HR Experts on Ethiopia is “unfair and biased scrutiny” is an understatement. The conclusions absolve the TPLF. Its lead conclusion is to hold Ethiopian and Eritrean leaders and officials accountable for a war they never initiated and for crimes they did not commit.\n\nI am not saying there has not been collateral damage, including deaths of innocent civilians: Tigreans, Afar, Amhara and Eritrean. We are talking about a civil war. But placing the burden of war crime, crime against humanity and crime of genocide on the governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea is patently partisan, unfair, unjust, and arrogant. For me, the international governance system is breaking apart. The pronouncement on Ethiopia and Eritrea shows Eurocentric bias and Western hegemony concerning a Black African state.\n\nMy conclusion is this is a form of proxy war on the diplomatic front that Ethiopia must deal with.\n\nI urge Ethiopians in Europe to demonstrate against the UN Human Rights Council.\n\n__\n\nTo Publish Article On borkena, please send submission to info@borkena.com for consideration.\n\nTelegram Channel : t.me/borkena\n\nJoin the conversation.

    "Al-Shabaab’s Attack in Ethiopia: One-off Incursion or Persistent Threat?": "Al-Shabaab’s Attack in Ethiopia: One-off Incursion or Persistent Threat?\n\nEthiopian forces in July contained and repulsed an attack conducted in the eastern part of the country by Somalia-based al-Shabaab. Fighters from the militant group entered from southwestern Somalia and targeted four border towns in Ethiopia’s Somali regional state known as Ogaden Region. The estimated 500 al-Shabaab fighters had moved 150 kilometers inside Ethiopia before being met by the Ethiopian military and retreating (Garowe Online, July 30).\n\nAfter several days of fighting, the Ethiopian military claimed it killed as many as 800 militants, including Fuad Mohammad Khalaf, who is also know as Fuad Shangole and was a senior al-Shabaab leader. The U.S designated Shangole as a foreign terrorist in 2010 and placed a $5 million bounty on his head in 2012 (People Dispatch, August 1). Al-Shabaab, however, later denied the Ethiopian claims about the death totals and asserted it had killed at least 100 Ethiopian servicemen, including policemen, before taking control of the town of Aoto (Sudan Tribune, August 7).\n\nThe attack came as surprise since al-Shabaab had not launched cross-border attacks into Ethiopia in years. However, the group has frequently targeted the nearly 4,000 Ethiopian troops operating in Somalia under the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS), which was formerly known as the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM). On August 21, Somali security forces, which are backed by ATMIS, for example, fought off a 30-hour al-Shabaab attack on Hotel Hayat in Mogadishu, which left at least 21 people dead. The attack was the first major attack since Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohammud took office in May (Nation, August 22).\n\nA More Confident and Expansionist Al-Shabaab\n\nThe attempt by al-Shabaab to spread to Ethiopia appears to have been thwarted by Ethiopian forces, but the attack underlines a resurgent, more confident, and strengthened al-Shabaab. Despite the group losing key territories to ATMIS forces and some of its top leaders in U.S airstrikes, such as Aden Hashi Farah “Ayro” in 2008 and Moktar Ali Zubeyr in 2014, the group continues to show resilience after each setback, always launching fresh attacks. It has also carried out continuous recruitment campaigns throughout the East Africa region (Garowe Online, January 1).\n\nAt the same time, the current political circumstances in Ethiopia create favorable ground for the militant group’s continued attacks. Ethiopia’s security forces have been struggling with internal unrest since the launch of the military operation in the northern state of Tigray in November 2020 (Terrorism Monitor, December 7, 2021). As the conflict persists, it is likely that al-Shabaab will take advantage of the turmoil to launch more cross-border attacks (Africa News, August 5).\n\nAdditionally, the push into Ethiopia can be seen as part of al-Shabaab leaders’ attempts to expand the conflict beyond Somalia. The vision was first articulated by the late Shaykh Ahmed Abdi Godane, who was the group’s emir and was killed in a U.S. airstrike in 2014 (aljazeera.com, September 6, 2014). Less than a year before the attacks in Ethiopia, Ahmed Diriye, who is al-Shabaab’s current emir, appeared to restate Godane’s vision. He called for external attacks beyond Somalia with emphasis on American and French interests, especially in Djibouti (African News, March 29, 2021).\n\nNorthern Kenya Under Threat From a Financially Emboldened Al-Shabaab\n\nApart from the attack in Ethiopia, al-Shabaab has persistently attacked parts of the northern and coastal regions of Kenya. In one of the latest attacks, five policemen were injured in Mandera in northern Kenya after suspected al-Shabaab fighters ambushed them while they were on patrol. In January, six people were also killed in Lamu in another attack by suspected members of al-Shabaab (The Star, January 3).\n\nMoreover, while controlling large swathes of territory in southern Somalia, the group has also outpaced the government in revenue collection. This provides al-Shabaab with the financial muscle it needs to further expand the insurgency (Somali Guardian, February 22). As a result, al-Shabaab has been strengthening its arsenal by spending a reported US$24 million out of its annual budget of US$180 million on arms purchases. The money is raised through taxation at checkpoints in Somalia or persuading or coercing the local population into paying tax (Hiraal Institute, October 2020).\n\nBesides purchasing guns, ammunition, explosives and other heavy weapons, the manufacture of explosives and some ammunition also comprises part of al-Shabaab’s budget. The weapons are being obtained from the local black market and international sources, with Yemen as a key exporter. Other weapons are also seized in battles with the Somali national army and ATMIS troops (Africa News, February 22).\n\nConclusion\n\nAl-Shabaab’s attempt to spread to Ethiopia appears to have been contained, but this was not a one–off attack and more attacks should be anticipated in the near future. At the same time, the current political circumstances in Ethiopia are creating fertile ground for the militant group’s attacks. The resolution of the Tigray crisis is paramount if any further spread of al-Shabaab into Ethiopia is to be stopped.",
    "Eritrea Calls Up Armed Forces After Ethiopia Clashes": "Eritrean authorities have called on their armed forces to mobilize in response to the renewed fighting in northern Ethiopia, the British and Canadian governments said.\n\nThe return to combat last month shattered a March truce and dashed hopes of peacefully resolving the nearly two-year war between Ethiopian authorities and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF).\n\nTigrayan authorities have since expressed readiness to hold talks led by the African Union, but the Ethiopian government has not responded publicly to the overtures, other than saying it remains \"committed\" to the AU-led peace process.\n\nBoth sides have accused the other of firing first, and fighting has spread from around southern Tigray to other fronts farther north and west, while also drawing in Eritrean troops who backed Ethiopian forces during the early phase of the war.\n\nIn travel advisories published late Friday, the Canadian and British governments warned their nationals in Eritrea to limit their movements following the mobilization call.\n\n\"Local authorities have issued a general call for mobilization of armed forces in response to the conflict in northern Ethiopia,\" the Canadian government said.\n\n\"Additional security measures could be imposed on short notice across the country,\" it said.\n\nThe British advisory said the Eritrean announcement was made on Wednesday.\n\n\"You should be extra vigilant at this time,\" the advisory said.\n\nEritrea, which is one of the world's most closed states, has not commented on the reports.\n\nSince the latest clashes broke out, Tigray has been bombed several times, with an official at Ayder Referral Hospital, the region's biggest, saying that 16 people had died in air strikes.\n\nAFP was not able to independently verify the claims. Access to northern Ethiopia is severely restricted and Tigray has been under a communications blackout for more than a year.\n\nThe TPLF ruled Ethiopia for decades before Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed took office in 2018.\n\nAbiy's government has declared the TPLF a terrorist group and considers its claim to authority in Tigray illegitimate.\n\nAbiy -- a Nobel Peace Prize laureate -- sent troops into Tigray in November 2020 to topple the TPLF, in response to what he said were attacks on federal army camps.\n\nBut the TPLF recaptured most of Tigray in a surprise comeback in June 2021.\n\nIt then expanded into the neighboring regions of Afar and Amhara before the fighting reached a stalemate.",
    "Avoiding the Abyss as War Resumes in Northern Ethiopia - Ethiopia": "Renewed fighting between a federal-Amhara-Eritrea coalition and Tigray’s forces has shattered a tenuous months-long truce. The reversal heralds a return to one of the world’s deadliest conflicts. International envoys should keep pressing the Ethiopian parties to renew the truce and begin formal direct negotiations.\n\nWar rages – again – in northern Ethiopia. The resumption of conflict on 24 August between the federal military, forces from the Amhara region, which borders Tigray, and Eritrean troops, on one side, and Tigray forces, on the other, marks the breach of a roughly nine-month truce that had largely halted some of the world’s deadliest fighting. The return to blows is a setback for a struggling peace process and strenuous efforts to get food to millions of besieged Tigrayans. Although it is unclear exactly why combat restarted or whether either side planned a sustained campaign, both immediately escalated, with a Tigrayan offensive to the south into Amhara and a joint Ethiopian-Eritrean incursion into Tigray from the north. Sustained full-blown hostilities would mean prolongation of a likely unwinnable war, creating more mass suffering. Instead, the Ethiopian parties must renew the truce and overcome the obstacles that have impeded the beginning of formal talks. Concerted high-level pressure by donors, many of whom have been distracted by the Ukraine crisis, will likely be vital to any breakthrough.\n\nA Return to Arms\n\nFighting in Ethiopia’s nearly two-year civil war – a brutal conflict that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives, displaced millions and generated credible reports of atrocities on all sides – resumed in northern Amhara on 24 August. Efforts to commence formal talks have failed to end the siege and humanitarian crisis in Tigray, and tensions have been rising over the course of the summer. As when the war broke out in November 2020, each side blamed the other for starting the hostilities, and it is not clear who shot first. As in 2020, federal troops had been massing near Tigray’s southern border for weeks. In recent months, Tigray’s leaders have also bolstered their own forces through rearming, recruitment and training.\n\nThe late August clashes in northern Amhara – just south of a part of Tigray that Amhara groups claim as their own – were preceded by smaller incidents. Federal forces shelled Tigray positions at Dedebit in north-western Tigray on 15 August. That was the first serious violation of a truce dating back, in effect, to December 2021 but formalised in March. Then, on 24 August, the day fighting to the south began, the federal military said it had shot down a plane the previous evening coming from Sudanese airspace to deliver weapons to Tigray. No independent source has verified that the plane was indeed carrying arms, but Tigray has previously received other air deliveries of unspecified cargo that Addis Ababa believes to have been lethal aid.\n\nWhether or not either side fully intended it, the fighting quickly spread, taking the country back to full-blown confrontation. Tigray’s fighters seem to have had the better of the first exchanges in the south, taking the northern Amhara town of Kobo on 27 August; Tigrayan media showed footage of prisoners of war arriving in Alamata town in southern Tigray. For its part, the federal air force bombed Tigray’s capital Mekelle on 26 August, and again overnight on 30-31 August, reportedly causing deaths by hitting a kindergarten and civilian areas near the main hospital.\n\nAs new fronts opened, each side painted the other as the aggressor. On 1 September, Tigray authorities said the Ethiopian and Eritrean armies had launched major offensives from Eritrea to the north. On Twitter, Eritrea’s ambassador to Kenya and Tanzania implicitly confirmed Asmara’s renewed involvement. Federal authorities, a day earlier, accused Tigray forces of staging an “invasion” of areas to the west of Kobo and also close to the disputed Sudanese border in Western Tigray. The latter clashes reportedly involved Tigrayan former UN peacekeepers who were stranded in Sudan during the war when they refused to return to Ethiopia. A top Tigray official told Crisis Group that these forces were defending their position near the Sudanese border, and that federal and Amhara units had tried to penetrate Tigray in the south.\n\nWar, Truce and War Again\n\nEthiopia’s civil war began in November 2020, when a constitutional dispute between Tigray and federal leaders escalated into conflict amid a prolonged power struggle. Momentum has repeatedly flipped sides. At first, the federal government (backed by Eritrea’s military and Amhara forces) pushed into Tigray, took Mekelle and compelled the region’s ruling Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) administration to flee to mountainous areas. Tigray forces subsequently regrouped to launch a guerrilla campaign that thwarted federal plans and, months later, recaptured Mekelle and reinstalled the TPLF government. In July 2021, partly in response to a renewed federal blockade, Tigray’s troops mounted an offensive, pushing in several directions in Amhara (amid accusations of atrocities), as well as south toward Addis Ababa in an attempt to dislodge Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s government. Then, in turn, the federal government, armed with new drones and backed by strong popular mobilisation, beat back Tigray’s forces, which retreated to their home region in December.\n\nThe subsequent lull in fighting evolved into a fragile, informal truce, with both sides making conciliatory gestures. In December, Addis Ababa ordered the release of key opposition prisoners and put forward a plan for national dialogue to address Ethiopia’s long-festering political challenges. In late March, the parties formalised a humanitarian truce, after which critical aid deliveries into Tigray began picking up. In the precarious new status quo, federal troops stayed largely outside Tigray, while Tigrayan forces left the Amhara holding onto Western Tigray (which the Amhara call Welkait) – where rights group say Amhara groups have committed atrocities and displaced 700,000, mostly Tigrayan residents, since the war began. Eritrean soldiers continued to occupy parts of Western Tigray (in the north) and north-eastern Tigray.\n\nEven following the truce, the humanitarian situation in Tigray remained dire. Despite the increase in food aid, Addis Ababa and its allies continued to block commercial traffic into the region, while tightly restricting the fuel supply and failing to restore Tigray’s electricity, telecommunications and banking services, all of which the federal government had severed in the conflict’s early phase and cut again after leaving Mekelle in June 2021.\n\nEfforts to get peace talks off the ground also foundered. Both sides took steps and offered commitments to engage in formal negotiations, but the latter never commenced amid squabbling between the two sides over mediators and preconditions. While the federal government and many outside actors backed an African Union-led process, the Tigray authorities expressed scepticism that this body, which is headquartered in Addis Ababa, could act as a fair arbiter, and rejected a lead role for its envoy, former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo. Tigray authorities have said they prefer Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta as mediator, but he is leaving power, having served his final term. It is unclear if Kenyatta could still play such a role after his anointed successor, Raila Odinga, lost to Deputy President William Ruto, who has a bitter relationship with Kenyatta, in Kenya’s 9 August election. Further complicating matters, the federal government demanded talks without preconditions, while Tigray authorities made negotiations contingent on both unfettered humanitarian operations and a full restoration of services, as well as the return of Western Tigray (a hotly contested area that the Amhara, who currently control it, claim the TPLF violently annexed in the early 1990s).\n\nInternational efforts to steer the parties toward peace have been uneven. Distracted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Western capitals reduced their high-level focus exactly as the truce in Ethiopia was beginning to take hold. The diplomacy that persists is often disjointed. For instance, the U.S., which has now dispatched its third regional envoy since creating the post in April 2021, facilitated a secret meeting between senior officials from both sides in June in Djibouti (there was a similar one earlier in Seychelles), where the federal government pledged to restore services to Tigray. But there was little follow-up to that meeting, with Tigray accusing Addis Ababa of breaking its pledge and Washington of failing to act as guarantor. When the AU’s Obasanjo subsequently tried to go to Mekelle days after a joint UN, U.S. and EU visit, and with still no progress made toward service restoration, Tigray’s leaders took it as another sign Abiy was reneging on the Djibouti pledges and rejected his request to visit. Obasanjo’s call for Eritrea to also attend prospective talks caught many other actors by surprise and cemented Mekelle’s view that he should not lead mediation efforts.\n\nFor Tigrayans, the conflict’s further escalation would bring major risks. Any form of renewed war is in fact likely to worsen the blockade of Tigray and the humanitarian crisis, with all aid operations to Tigray suspended since hostilities kicked off. In a 23 August letter to international partners, which reiterated demands for federal authorities to restore services and return Western Tigray to Mekelle’s control, Tigray’s president concluded by warning again that the region would fight to end the blockade if necessary. But the reality is that, while Tigray may well be able to demonstrate its military prowess, it looks unlikely to achieve its ends in the short term. Its forces would face a major challenge in seeking to break through the combined force of federal, Amhara and Eritrean troops to open and then maintain a corridor to neighbouring Sudan. Nor is there much reason to think that another push south, aimed at overthrowing Abiy, is likelier to succeed than last time. Rather, renewed fighting could well embolden hardliners in Addis Ababa and Asmara, as well as among Amhara’s political leaders who want to double down on the siege strategy that has so devastated Tigray.\n\nAbiy, too, would likely lose out from an escalation. He still has no viable military and political strategy for bending Mekelle to his will. His administration has already proven unable to hold and govern Tigray in the face of a resolute and popular insurgency, which his own brutal tactics served to inflame. A rebooted full-blown war is likely to increase his government’s international isolation at a time when the Ethiopian economy desperately needs foreign aid, while bogging Addis Ababa down in a costly, deadly and unwinnable conflict with a foe that has had time to regroup and is fighting for its survival. Clashes near the Ethiopia-Sudan border in an area contested by those two states as well as by Amhara and Tigray raise the stakes further. Should these skirmishes persist, Sudanese troops could become involved, possibly in a de facto alliance with Tigray forces. That development would increase the likelihood of a disastrous, wider confrontation, pitting Sudan against Ethiopia – they are already at loggerheads over disputed border areas and Ethiopia’s new megadam on the Blue Nile river – and maybe Eritrea as well.\n\nIf any actor expects to gain from more violence, it is probably Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki, whose forces fought alongside federal and Amhara troops against Tigray during the war’s first phases, re-entered the fray recently and, as noted above, continue to occupy parts of the region’s west and north east. Isaias considers the TPLF a historical and existential foe. He thus opposes any rapprochement between the TPLF and Addis Ababa that would mean rehabilitating the Tigray party (he almost certainly welcomed Ethiopian federal authorities classifying the TPLF as a terrorist organisation in May 2021). He may well struggle to take on Tigray on his own, however, meaning that he is unlikely to be able to pursue war if Abiy wants to return to the truce.\n\nRenewing the Truce\n\nIt is essential that the African and international envoys who have been engaged diplomatically continue to demand that the main antagonists rein in their forces, prevent further escalation and agree on a new truce – while beginning to set the stage for formal talks. The window for averting a return to a sustained full-blown war appears to be short. Until a 2 August visit to Mekelle by the EU, U.S. and UN special envoys – which has now been followed by an early September visit to Addis Ababa, under way as this statement goes to press, by the U.S. and UN emissaries, plus Obasanjo – outside actors working for a peaceful resolution had been watching too passively, as a volatile standoff drifted back toward conflict and the peace process stalled. A higher-level, more intense degree of engagement is required.\n\nThe main external actors, including the AU, U.S., EU and UN, as well as Kenya, should move immediately and in concert. The recent joint trips by envoys to Mekelle and Addis Ababa are a welcome start and should be paired with higher-level engagement from all, such as telephone calls from senior officials. They should make clear to Abiy’s government that major non-humanitarian assistance, including World Bank projects and any new International Monetary Fund financing, may be in jeopardy should the federal government fail to stop its offensives and continue the de facto blockade of Tigray. The war puts donors seeking to ease Ethiopia’s economic difficulty in a bind. Yet, while they should keep scaling up humanitarian relief, they should take direct budget support off the table for now lest they wind up bankrolling a revived federal war effort. Further, donors risk undermining a key incentive for Abiy to make peace should they continue to ramp up major development assistance even as war resumes.\n\nExternal players, including the AU, should also insist with as much unity as possible that Eritrea withdraw its troops from Tigray (and that Abiy press for this result) and that the federal government honour its representatives’ private pledges at the U.S.-facilitated June meeting in Djibouti with Tigray officials to restore banking, telecommunications and electricity services to the beleaguered region.\n\nOutside actors should lean on Tigray as well. They should keep demanding that its leaders desist from steps that would further escalate the fighting and agree to a truce. Mekelle should agree to hold the necessary discussions with the federal authorities on the logistical and security aspects of restoring services to Tigray, such as how to manage payments and provide security for installation and maintenance technicians. Diplomats also need to mediate a dispute between Tigray’s government and the World Food Programme after the former grabbed twelve WFP tankers on 25 August, saying the UN agency refused to return in kind fuel it was owed. Tigray’s seizure of the WFP fuel trucks creates a further constraint on already woefully insufficient humanitarian operations that have left at least half of Tigray’s approximately seven million people in need of support. Unless the incident is remedied, federal authorities are likely to use it as a reason to restrict, or completely close off, the region’s fuel supply, arguing that Tigray’s authorities redirect humanitarian assistance to their military operation.\n\nIf the parties can be persuaded to de-escalate and restore the truce, the next step is clearing still substantial hurdles to formal talks. At the end of August, a senior Tigray commander insisted to Crisis Group that the federal government must at least publicly commit to completely lifting the blockade and restoring services before any form of discussions can occur. For its part, Addis Ababa’s latest position on the issue was that those things would happen only alongside discussions over a permanent ceasefire. An Ethiopian diplomat told Crisis Group on 31 August that it was not practical to restore services with the TPLF still armed and prepared for war.\n\nMuch as African and international players should continue to insist that Ethiopia restore services, Tigray’s leaders should also weigh whether their demands for the government to fulfil what they cast as its legal obligations in advance of talks are well advised, particularly if they help prolong an intolerable, immiserating status quo. There are alternatives that could allow Mekelle to maintain a position of principle while making practical progress toward peace. For example, Tigray’s representatives could attend formal talks but limit their discussions to the logistical and security issues of reconnecting Tigray to trade, aid and services, leaving formal talks on other issues until the government has lifted the siege. In such a scenario, the formality of the process and extra international scrutiny could help increase external pressure on the federal government to honour its pledge to restore services and end its punishment of Tigray’s civilian population, even if international actors’ pleas to this effect have long gone unheeded.\n\nAnother hugely difficult issue that will likely need to be finessed until talks get off the ground is the status of Western Tigray. The area has been administered by Tigray throughout the current federal era that began in the early 1990s, but is also claimed by the Amhara, which seized it when the present conflict began, citing their longstanding stance that the TPLF forcibly took it, displacing the native population when the Tigrayan party rose to power in the 1990s. The 2020 Amhara takeover involved the violent expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Tigrayans and widely reported atrocities by Amhara forces and militia against civilians. Tigray’s leaders face substantial pressure from Tigrayans not to make concessions that legitimise these new facts on the ground and have refused to negotiate over the area’s constitutional status. Reclaiming the area would also allow the besieged region a corridor to resupply itself through Sudan.\n\nFinding common ground with respect to Western Tigray will be no small task, as the sides remain far apart. Amhara outright rejects Tigray’s demand that it withdraw and return the territory to its pre-war status, and Addis Ababa has thus far declined to force the issue. Abiy may well have assessed that favouring Tigray in this instance would be too costly for him in Amhara, which has been a core pillar of his political and wartime coalition. In recent months, in order to assert control, the federal and Amhara governments have arrested thousands of members of Amhara’s nationalist militia, known as Fano, causing opposition to Abiy to grow in Ethiopia’s second-largest region. Abiy can ill afford to lose more Amhara support given the host of other problems his government is facing, including the growing rebellion in Ethiopia’s most populous region, Oromia, which is nominally Abiy’s base. Furthermore, the prospect of Tigray gaining the capacity to resupply itself from Sudan via Western Tigray is unacceptable both to Abiy and Isaias.\n\nRather than let the intractable Western Tigray issue continue to be an obstacle to de-escalation and peace talks, the parties should get around the table and discuss disagreements there. To help matters along, the federal government could publicly acknowledge that Amhara’s violent takeover was unconstitutional, and call for Amhara and Eritrean forces to leave the area so recently displaced residents can return. These steps could open the door to Tigray representatives attending the talks, although it would also require Mekelle to implicitly accept the need for a political process on Western Tigray and, during that process, federal control of the area if and when the other forces leave. Tigrayan and federal commitments to a future political process to assess the various claims might help ease Amhara concerns. Long-term solutions that might emerge from those discussions include Amhara and Tigray agreeing to jointly administer the area, ensuring minority rights protections or creating an autonomous district accountable directly to the federal government.\n\nLast is the question of mediation. To ease Tigrayan concerns about AU mediation, the AU could create a panel of senior African officials to lead the process, which in addition to Obasanjo could include representatives from the Kenyan, South African and/or Algerian governments. Should talks progress to permanent ceasefire arrangements, Western partners, particularly the U.S. and EU, would likely need to act as guarantors of any agreement. The UN would probably be best positioned to monitor it, though reaching agreement to such an arrangement in Addis Ababa and New York will not be easy. In any event, more coordinated efforts from all the major outside actors will be necessary to hold the parties to their commitments and to get talks under way. Such a boosted approach will also be required in the future to deal with sticky Western Tigray discussions, as well as all aspects of re-establishing relations between the federal and Tigray governments, including Mekelle’s demand for a self-determination referendum and the future status of Tigray’s forces.\n\nTo alter the current trajectory, high-level visits to Addis and Mekelle by the U.S. and other international officials may be useful; ideally, these would be coordinated for maximum effect (as indeed happened with the joint visit to Mekelle by the U.S., EU and UN special envoys in early August, even though that proved insufficient to curb the renewed fighting). To further raise awareness of the gravity of the situation, African leaders might convene a meeting on Ethiopia’s crisis at the forthcoming UN General Assembly. While focused international attention is vital to prevent more carnage, the onus for preventing more senseless death and suffering in Ethiopia rests on Ethiopian leaders on both sides of the conflict, as well as Eritrea’s government. If the parties do not find a way to address their differences around the negotiating table, then the brutal war will continue, with Ethiopia’s people paying the price of their failure.",

    "Ethiopia: Civilians in Western Oromia Left Unprotected": "Click to expand Image Distribution of approximate 480 damaged structures destroyed by fire in five villages in Tole kebele, Gutin, Silsaw, Chekorsa and Begene as of July 25, 2022. These numbers might be an underestimate, as it was only conducted within the area covered by the satellite imagery, and additional structures might be also affected. Satellite image: 25 July 2022. © 2022 Planet Labs PBC. Analysis and graphics © 2022 Human Rights Watch\n\n(Nairobi, August 31, 2022) – An armed group killed several hundred Amhara civilians in western Oromia in June 2022 while Ethiopian security forces did little to protect them, Human Rights Watch said today. Nearly three months later, the Ethiopian government has failed to provide adequate shelter or meaningfully address the serious health and protection concerns of surviving residents.\n\nFor eight hours on June 18, heavily armed assailants shot and killed about 400 Amhara civilians, including many women and children, in villages in Tole and Sene kebeles (wards). The unidentified assailants also burned and destroyed hundreds of homes and businesses, and looted livestock and other property. Satellite imagery analysis corroborated the burning of at least five villages and the destruction of approximately 480 structures. Despite warnings, government security forces stationed nearby did not arrive until hours after the attack.\n\n“Armed attackers destroyed one village after another, killed entire families with unmitigated cruelty, all while nearby government forces appeared to do nothing,” said Laetitia Bader, Horn of Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “This is just the latest such massacre for which the Ethiopian government needs to do more to ensure credible and independent investigations, identify those responsible, and ensure adequate assistance reaches everyone in need.”\n\nSince 2019, government forces and the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) armed group have been fighting in western Oromia, resulting in serious abuses against Oromo and minority communities. Ethiopian authorities alleged that the OLA was responsible for the June massacre and other attacks. The OLA accused a government militia of carrying out the attacks and called for an independent investigation.\n\nBetween June and August, Human Rights Watch interviewed 25 people by phone, including 19 witnesses and relatives of victims from 5 villages: Gutin; Chekorsa; Silsaw; Begene, in Tole kebele in western Oromia; and a village in neighboring Sene kebele in the Benishangul Gumuz region. Human Rights Watch obtained lists of those killed from residents and analyzed satellite imagery collected before and after the attack. From April to May 2021, Human Rights Watch also interviewed 12 witnesses and family members of a similar attack in Bone kebele, in Babo Gembel district in western Oromia, and conducted follow-up interviews in August 2022.\n\nOn the morning of June 18, as male residents left to tend to their crops on nearby farmland or to go to the market, leaving woman and children in the villages, groups of heavily armed men unexpectedly attacked villages in Tole and Sene kebeles.\n\nA farmer from Gutin said he first heard gunfire and saw smoke rising from the direction of Silsaw, a village north of the main asphalt road and near Gutin and Chekorsa. “I ran toward my house and noticed the area encircled by gunmen,” he said. “I took my children to the bush for safety and hid in a tree near the village. The gunmen were … fully uniformed and armed … I heard them saying: ‘Finish them. Don’t Leave. End them.’”\n\nA woman from Chekorsa escaped with her five children to nearby maize fields. The attackers pursued them:\n\n\n\nMy 8-month-old child started crying. I heard an attacker say, ‘Look there, look there …’ before they shot in our direction. They shot my baby dead. I wrapped the dead body with some clothes I was wearing. My other child was shot in her back; the bullet came out around her neck … I then pressed my injured child against my chest, and I prayed to Allah to save her life.\n\n\n\nHer older child survived but required two weeks of hospital treatment.\n\nThe attacks lasted several hours in some villages, including until 2 p.m. in Gutin and longer in others. Five residents said they made numerous frantic calls to district authorities for help, and to federal and regional government security forces stationed in Jogir, about 17 kilometers from Tole, as well as to a military camp in Didessa. A small contingent of Ethiopian military forces arrived only at 4 p.m., after the attackers had left. Residents then began returning home, where they witnessed the aftermath of the onslaught, and began burying those killed in mass graves.\n\nIn Silsaw, residents found bodies throughout the village, including about 29 in the mosque compound. “From a single family, five, six people were killed,” said a 20-year-old woman. “In other cases, families lost 20 people.” In Gutin, residents found 12 charred bodies among the remains of a burned grass house.\n\nThree residents involved in burying victims believed that over 400 people had been killed in at least 6 villages. Community leaders, who gathered lists of those killed and property destruction, estimated that at least 112 were killed in Silsaw, 105 in Chekorsa, 37 in Gutin, 72 in Begene, 16 in Hayaw, and 50 in Sene kebele. At a June 30 media briefing, a spokesperson of the Office of the Prime Minister said that the bodies of 338 people had been identified.\n\nThe attacks in Tole and Sene mirror other killings of Amhara civilians in western Oromia. Less than two weeks later, the media reported that armed groups attacked predominantly Amhara civilians in Hawa Gelan district, Kellem Wellega Zone, killing scores. A March 2021 attack on Amhara civilians in Bone kebele, West Wellega Zone, similarly left scores dead.\n\nSurvivors from Tole and Sene said that fear of continued attacks in the area, and insufficient protection and humanitarian support was forcing many residents to leave Oromia.\n\nThe United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said that at least 4,800 people were displaced from Tole, and that more than 500,000 had been displaced in western Oromia due to the conflict there.\n\nOCHA also reported that it was hard for aid groups to get access to the region because of access restrictions, inadequate funding, and a lack of humanitarian presence. Ethiopian authorities need to create a conducive environment for aid delivery, Human Rights Watch said.\n\nThe Ethiopian authorities’ immediate response to the attack was to announce that they would intensify “law enforcement measures” against armed groups. On July 6, Ethiopia’s parliament authorized the establishment of a special committee to investigate violence against civilians in several regions in Ethiopia, including Oromia, and to make recommendations.\n\nBut people in Tole, Sene, and Bone kebeles said there have been little signs of investigations so far. The government should provide regular public updates on its investigations, and its steps to curtail abuses by armed groups as well as federal and regional security forces and militias, Human Rights Watch said.\n\nBoth the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet and the African Union Chairman Moussa Faki called for independent investigations into the attacks in western Oromia. In a June 30 Oral Update before the UN Human Rights Council, the chairperson of the UN International Commission of Human Rights Experts on Ethiopia expressed alarm at atrocities against civilians in Ethiopia, including western Oromia, and urged member states to provide the commission with experienced investigators and other support.\n\n“Communities in western Oromia have been left reeling from repeated attacks and are living in fear of the next attack,” Bader said. “Ethiopian authorities should urgently move beyond promises to act and provide urgent and adequate humanitarian assistance to affected communities, and support for credible independent investigations.”\n\nConflict in Western Oromia\n\nSince 2019, Ethiopian government forces and the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) armed group have engaged in an armed conflict in western Oromia. The OLA was previously the military wing of the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF), a once-banned political opposition group, that fought a low-level insurgency for the self-determination of Oromos for decades.\n\nAfter Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed assumed office in April 2018, the government reached an agreement with various opposition groups, including the exiled leaders of the Oromo Liberation Front in Eritrea, who agreed to lay down arms, reintegrate, and commit to a peaceful political struggle. However, negotiations soon broke down.\n\nBy early 2019, the government had established military command posts in western and southern Oromia. Federal and regional security forces began coordinated military operations against the OLA. In April 2019, the OLA formally broke its ties with the OLF and continued its armed operations.\n\nThe conflict has resulted in serious human rights abuses. Government forces have carried out summary executions, arbitrary arrests, and detentions of Oromos, and have at times cut communications in the area. The OLA has killed government officials and attacked non-military government offices. Unidentified armed assailants have also been implicated in killings, abductions, destruction of homes, and mass displacements of ethnic Amhara communities. Residents of Tole kebele in western Oromia said that OLA fighters in the neighboring hills for the past three years have abducted people and demanded ransom.\n\nHuman Rights Watch documented a March 30, 2021, attack on Babo Gembel district, West Wellega Zone. At around 8 p.m., gunmen surrounded Sedeka village, in Bone kebele, forced the Amhara residents to gather for a meeting, and shot 28 dead. A man who had fled the village as residents were being gathered said that the armed men spoke Afaan-Oromo, the Oromo language, and had distinctive long hair, which residents said was common among OLA fighters. He climbed a tree and stayed there until 2 a.m., “I later heard gunfire,” he said at the time. Residents called for help from the Oromia regional special forces, who were stationed about 30 minutes away, but they didn’t arrive until 2 a.m., long after the attack had ended.\n\nOne village leader lost his brother and his sister-in-law in the attack. “We had just celebrated their marriage on Thursday [March 25], and they were then killed on Tuesday evening,” he said. “After all the preparations to celebrate their marriage, we began to prepare for their funeral … A mother of a 15-day-old baby was also among the killed.”\n\nAttacks in Tole and Sene Kebeles, June 18\n\nOn June 14, the OLA clashed with government forces in the Gambella region, and in Gimbi town, in western Oromia, 49 kilometers from Tole kebele. Around June 17, government security forces stationed in Tole, along with a small number of local militiamen and Oromia police, left the area without explanation, several local residents said.\n\nIn the early hours of June 18, residents in several villages in the adjacent Tole and Sene kebeles saw armed men gathering. They said the attackers wore a mix of civilian clothes and uniforms worn by the Oromia regional special forces, militias, and the former Ethiopian national military uniform. They later noted that they spoke in Afaan Oromo and some of the armed men had long hair.\n\nAt 7 a.m., a farmer in Silsaw village and a kebele official, among others, called various officials and security forces for protection and support. The official said, “When I first called, they said they couldn’t take action, without discussion and reaching an agreement with the zone [an administrative division].”\n\nAround 9 a.m., attackers began shooting near Silsaw village in Tole kebele andstarted torching village buildings. Residents said scores of men, armed with military assault weapons, then stormed villages around Tole and Sene kebeles and pursued residents who fled into surrounding areas.\n\nSome farmers around Silsaw and other villages reported that they initially tried to resist the attack, but were outnumbered by the armed men, who carried machine guns, rifles, and Kalashnikov assault weapons. “Some of the men among us had our own guns,” said a farmer from Silsaw. “When they started shooting, we also tried to defend ourselves. Twelve people among us who were trying to defend themselves were also killed.”\n\nMany residents began to flee into nearby farmland or river areas. An 18-year-old woman from Silsaw village described being captured:\n\nI was fetching water when these forces approached. I ran to Chekorsa village, but I was caught and taken away from there to a field. Others that were running away were shot. They gathered other people as well [and brought them to the field]. Many were children. We were around 60. They asked us for money, phones, jewelry, and watches. After they took our property, they started shooting. They were bragging, as they were shooting … saying “We are heroes, and no one can escape from us. We will kill you all. Even those who escape, we will come after you wherever you are.”\n\n\n\nThe woman said she was shot in the arm, around her back, and in her leg, but managed to survive, along with seven other people.\n\nA man, 48, said: “We hid in the bushes. Two people were killed near me. One was my wife’s relative. He left behind three young children.”\n\nA woman, 20, fled Silsaw village along with her aunt and her aunt’s 6-month-old twins. “I was carrying one of the babies … It was such a difficult moment,” she said. “Bullets were going over our heads. I thought we were doomed. We survived by God’s mercy.”\n\nRetrieval of Bodies, Burials\n\nAt about 4 p.m., a small contingent of Ethiopian military forces arrived in Tole kebele. Residents began returning home that evening.\n\nA farmer, 48, from Gutin lost four family members, including his 22-year-old in daughter-in-law and his 4-year-old granddaughter. He found their charred bodies along with 10 other people, in a burned grass-thatched house in the village. He said that 5 of those killed were children under age 8.\n\nIn Sene kebele, a man from Sene village returned to find 21 people in his compound dead, including his wife and daughter, 8 other relatives, and several neighbors. His 11-year-old son survived but had been shot 4 times.\n\nA man from Chekorsa said he had desperately searched for his family:\n\nI tried to go check on the house where I took my family members [for safety], but they weren’t there. I looked for them in the maize fields but couldn’t find them. I heard that many people were collected and killed in Silsaw [a neighboring village]. I saw people injured and dead on the way.\n\n\n\nHe said he found the bodies of his wife, who was 8-months’ pregnant, and their three young children in the mosque compound, where the assailants had gathered and executed 29 people:\n\nMy wife and three children, ages 2, 6 and 10, were killed with others in the compound of the mosque. Everyone was rushing to identify the dead bodies. I tried to help gather those killed. It was raining heavily at the time.\n\nIt’s difficult to explain what I felt after what happened. I can’t say that human beings did this. It is the maximum cruelty I have seen. We couldn’t bury them all that day.\n\n\n\nResidents said that 112 people were killed in Silsaw alone and that they buried about 60 people in the mosque compound. Community leaders said that over 400 people were killed in Tole and Sene areas, during the June 18 attack, and had made lists of the dead.\n\n“The majority of the victims were women and children,” a kebele official from Gutin village said. “The village was filled with dead bodies … We started collecting them and burying them in different areas, some in mass graves.”\n\nSome of the survivors had been displaced from other areas. “We previously lived in Arjo [East Wellega Zone],” said a 38-year-old woman from Tole. “We were forced to leave the area after our houses were burned and property looted. That was eight months ago, and we fled to Tole, now [this] happened again.”\n\nLooting and Destruction of Property\n\nThe assailants looted property and livestock and destroyed civilian structures during the attack. Satellite imagery recorded on June 18, at about 10 a.m., shows smoke plumes emanating from Gutin, Chekorsa, and Silsaw villages. Additional smoke plumes were visible over Gutin 45 minutes later. Thermal anomaly data collected by an environmental sensor, and reviewed by Human Rights Watch, also confirms the time of those attacks, showing several fires in Tole kebele.\n\nClick to expand Image Six distinct smoke plumes emanating from Gutin, Chekorsa, Silsaw villages and surrounding areas in Tole kebele, Oromia region, Ethiopia, on June 18 at 10:07 am local time.

Analysis & graphics © 2022 Human Rights Watch.\n\nHuman Rights Watch was able to estimate the scale of the destruction by analyzing satellite imagery recorded on July 25. Damage signatures detected on satellite imagery are consistent with arson and confirm the destruction of approximately 480 structures across 5 villages in Tole kebele, including Gutin, Chekorsa, Silsaw and Begene, but were unable to identify the fifth village with visible destruction. Most of the damaged structures seen on imagery are tukuls (huts). Silsaw and Begene recorded the highest number of structures affected. These numbers might be an underestimate, as it only included the area covered by the satellite imagery.\n\nA man from Chekorsa said that his house had bullet holes and several other houses in the village were burned, and stores destroyed.\n\n“I had so many properties back there,” said a man from Silsaw. “I had a farm, I just brought fertilizer. But my house was burned down, I lost everything.” He had left Silsaw for Wollo, in the Amhara region and had no plans to return.\n\nClick to expand Image Satellite image showing a snapshot of the substantial damaged structures by fire across four different villages in Tole kebele, Oromia region, Ethiopia.

Analysis and graphics © 2022 Human Rights Watch\n\nThree residents from Silsaw and Begene villages said that a separate group of attackers had looted property, including livestock and personal items. A resident of Begene said:\n\nThere were three groups. The first that killed people indiscriminately, a second group that looted cows and properties, and a third that burned houses. Sixteen of my cows were taken, and 100 quintals [a unit of weight equal to 112 pounds] of grain destroyed. My house was burned down, and I lost over 200,000 Ethiopian birr [US$3,800].\n\n\n\nInadequate Investigations and Humanitarian Assistance\n\nThe government and the Ethiopian Red Cross reported that they provided humanitarian assistance to residents following the June 18 attack. However, remaining residents who spoke to Human Rights Watch said that they only received a one-time distribution of food, and as of August lacked shelter and faced serious health risks.\n\nA farmer, 48, from Silsaw said: “We are now living with the help of the Ethiopian military who are sharing their own food … We don’t even have enough cooking utensils, so we are sharing one utensil among 10 people.” A man from Chekorsa said a registration of remaining residents took place in early August but added that they still did not receive any additional aid.\n\nA farmer from Begene said: “There is nowhere to shelter now. It’s the rainy season. We sometimes use plastic shelter from the rain. But we don’t have enough food to sustain our lives ... we are worried about malaria.” He added: “It’s time to remove the weeds from the farms, but we can’t because it’s not safe. The Ethiopian military can’t protect us there so people are losing hope to live here and are leaving … Many went to Wollo or Debre Birhan [in the Amhara region].”\n\nSurvivors with serious injuries have also faced obstacles to receiving adequate medical care. The man from Sene whose 11-year-old son was shot four times said he had been struggling to get him proper treatment: “I am begging to treat my son and moving from hospital to hospital … My son is not completely healed, but the hospital gave me a discharge letter. And I don’t know where to take him now. I am standing in the rain. I don’t know where to go. Right now, I have nothing.”\n\nSimilarly, more than 18 months after the March 2021 attack on Bone kebele, the survivors were still living at a displacement site in Benishangul-Gumuz. “It’s been four months since we received food aid, we are starving,” said the village leader in August. “We received a call from the local authorities to return, but still, we are afraid. We were informed that it is still insecure …We heard that only four people were punished, and that many residents seeking to flee have been abducted.”\n\nSeveral residents from Tole raised concerns that the government had inadequately investigated the attack. “One week after the incident, a wereda (district) official and the vice-president of the Oromia regional state came and talked to us,” said a man from Gutin. “Since then, no one has talked to us.” A farmer from Begene said that “no government body came to my village to investigate the number of killings or property destroyed.”\n\nHowever, a farmer from Silsaw said that government investigators came once to speak to communities gathered around Chekorsa village: “They went around Chekorsa and Silsaw. They went to Silsaw to observe where people were buried, and property destroyed. But they didn’t go to other areas where the attacks happened.”\n\nRecommendations\n\nAll parties to the armed conflict in western Oromia should facilitate the provision of humanitarian assistance to all populations at risk. They should also cooperate and provide full, unimpeded access to independent investigators to all conflict-affected areas.\n\nThe Ethiopian government should:\n\nPublicly provide information on the steps it is taking to investigate and appropriately prosecute killings, pillage, the destruction of property, and other abuses by non-state armed groups.\n\nUrgently provide or facilitate humanitarian assistance, including food, medical care, and shelter to Amhara and other communities affected by June 18 violence and other incidents of violence in Oromia.\n\nInvestigate the role of local and regional authorities and national security forces who may have been negligent in their duty to protect civilians, and publicly disclose the results of the investigation.\n\nEnsure credible, independent, and impartial investigations into reports of security force abuses, including arbitrary arrests and extrajudicial executions of Oromo communities in western Oromia.\n\nTo the OLA and other armed groups operating in western Oromia:",

So far, as many as half a million Ethiopians have died, and more than 1.6 million people have been displaced.\n\n“Respect for this truce over the past five months has saved countless lives,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in response to the renewed hostilities, which began last Wednesday. He warned that “a return to active conflict would result in widespread suffering, human rights abuses, and further economic hardships.”\n\nBoth the Ethiopian government and the TPLF reported fighting between their forces but denied instigating the fighting—blaming the other party.\n\nThe Ethiopian Ministry of Defense said in a statement that its Air Force shot down a plane carrying weapons for Tigrayan rebels from neighboring Sudan on Aug. 24. TPLF spokesperson Getachew Reda wrote in a tweet that the statement was “a blatant lie.”\n\nHostilities have escalated quickly since then. On Friday, UNICEF condemned an airstrike by the Ethiopian government that the organization said “hit a kindergarten, killing several children, and injuring others” in Mekelle, Tigray’s capital. Local medics say at least seven people were killed. International media cannot verify these numbers because the region remains inaccessible to journalists.\n\n“Yet again, an escalation of violence in northern Ethiopia has caused children to pay the heaviest price,” UNICEF executive director Catherine Russell wrote in a tweet.\n\nGraphic images of wounded children circulated on social media and were broadcast on a Tigrayan TV station. The Ethiopian government subsequently denied targeting the kindergarten, saying the Ethiopian Air Force only targets military sites. It urged residents of Tigray to stay away from military facilities.\n\nMeanwhile, the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) said Tigrayan authorities stole 570,000 liters of fuel from its warehouses in the region last Wednesday, jeopardizing humanitarian operations there. According to the United Nations, supplies of food, medicine, and fuel in Tigray are critically low. The organization says full-blown famine looms in Tigray as East Africa experiences its worst drought in 40 years.\n\n“Millions will starve if we do not have fuel to deliver food,” WFP executive director David Beasley wrote in a tweet condemning the theft. Tigrayan authorities hit back with a statement claiming they had loaned more than 600,000 liters of fuel to the WFP this year.\n\nSecurity experts had hoped Tigray was finally on a path toward peace when, in January, Abiy’s government released Tigrayan opposition leaders from prison and indicated a willingness to talk with the TPLF. In a statement two weeks ago, Addis Ababa again signaled its intent for peace “and restoration of services to the region.” After fighting began in 2020, the government cut essential services like electricity and banking in Tigray.\n\nIn response to the government’s overtures, TPLF leader Debretsion Gebremichael said his side stood ready to “negotiate in good faith” but that the peace process “envisaged” by African Union mediator and former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo was “set up to fail.”\n\nThe TPLF has demanded the federal government restore essential services and humanitarian access to the region before talks begin, whereas the government rejects preconditions. The TPLF has accused Obasanjo of siding with Abiy on this matter.\n\nLast week, Getachew, the TPLF spokesperson, wrote in an op-ed published by the Africa Report that a negotiated cease-fire and political settlement “are nowhere closer to being achieved now than they were at the time of Mr. Obasanjo’s appointment a year ago.” Getachew accused the AU of being “an apologist for a brutal regime seeking to starve and bomb its own people into submission.”\n\nAlthough the TPLF has appealed to the U.S. government, efforts by the Biden administration to end the conflict have also proved ineffective.\n\nOn Aug. 2, the new U.S. special envoy to the Horn of Africa, Mike Hammer, joined his European Union counterpart, Annette Weber, on a one-day visit to Tigray. Both had hoped to facilitate the beginning of talks and called for the “swift restoration” of essential services in Tigray. Ethiopia’s federal security advisor, Redwan Hussein, criticized the envoys for echoing the TPLF’s demands.\n\nWilliam Davison, an analyst with the International Crisis Group, told Foreign Policy that the TPLF’s fuel seizure “unfortunately makes it less likely that the federal government is going to allow … unfettered humanitarian access” to the region.\n\nThere is no new foreign actor who can apply any more leverage than has been attempted so far, Davison noted. To temper the TPLF’s rejection of Obasanjo, Davison suggested the AU bring on an additional African mediator. “Realistically, there would have to be a reformulation … with Obasanjo having some role but not necessarily the exclusive lead mediating role,” he said.\n\n“If the federal government was willing to resume services [to Tigray] and if the Tigrayan leadership was willing to meet and discuss their differences at talks convened by the African Union and other African partners, that would help,” he added. But most analysts—Davison included—fear there is little prospect of progress toward reconciliation and peace soon.\n\nThe Week Ahead\n\nMonday, Aug. 29, to Friday, Sept. 2: Gabon hosts Africa Climate Week in the run-up to U.N. climate negotiations later this year.\n\nThursday, Sept. 1, to Friday, Sept. 2: Portuguese Prime Minister António Costa travels to Mozambique for the fifth Portugal-Mozambique summit.\n\nMonday, Sept. 5: The deadline for Kenya’s Supreme Court to issue a ruling on a challenge to the results of the country’s Aug. 9 elections by presidential candidate Raila Odinga expires.\n\nWhat We’re Watching\n\nAngola’s MPLA wins. In Angola’s election last Wednesday, the People’s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) won 51.17 percent of the vote, securing a second five-year term for incumbent President João Lourenço. The main opposition party, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (or UNITA), garnered 43.95 percent—and won the capital, Luanda—in one of the closest elections in the country’s history. Esperança Maria Eduardo Francisco da Costa, Lourenço’s running mate, will become Angola’s first female vice president.\n\nUNITA has rejected the results, citing a lack of transparency in how they were tallied. As this newsletter covered last week, Lourenço’s administration passed a law in September 2021 to centralize vote-counting rather than adding up tallies from each municipality and province. Experts say the central electoral agency is partisan and controlled by the ruling government.\n\nPeople under age 30 make up more than two-thirds of Angola’s population and largely wanted a change from the MPLA’s 47-year rule, according to polling. In the last presidential elections, in 2017, the MPLA won 61.07 percent of the vote to UNITA’s 26.67 percent.\n\nClashes in Libya. Libya’s U.N.-backed government says it has taken control of the capital, Tripoli, after deadly clashes broke out on Saturday between militias backed by the country’s two rival administrations. At least 32 people were killed and more than 159 people were wounded, according to the country’s Ministry of Health.\n\nLibya has been beset by months of political stalemate between the U.N.-backed Government of National Unity in Tripoli and a rival administration under Fathi Bashagha in the country’s east. An attempt by Bashagha to install his government in Tripoli in May previously triggered violence.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron stands next to Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune at Houari Boumediene Airport in Algeria on Aug. 27.\n\nFrench-Algerian ties. On Saturday, French President Emmanuel Macron wrapped up a three-day trip to Algeria aimed at improving fractured relations between the two countries. Macron agreed to allow an additional 8,000 Algerian students to study in France this year—an important policy reversal after Paris’s announcement last September that it would cut the number of visas available to Algerian, Tunisian, and Moroccan nationals.\n\nAt the time, Macron justified the visa reduction by claiming the three North African countries were obstructing the return of their nationals who had been expelled from France. He angered Algerians further when he questioned Algeria’s existence as a nation before France’s 132-year occupation and accused its “political-military system” of rewriting history. “Was there an Algerian nation before French colonization? That is the question,” Macron reportedly said. Algiers recalled its ambassador to Paris in response.\n\nOn Thursday, Macron and his Algerian counterpart, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, announced the establishment of a joint commission of historians to study French colonization in Algeria.\n\nSince Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February, European leaders have sought to renew ties with gas-producing African nations, such as Algeria, as these countries gain strategic importance in light of Western sanctions on Russian energy and Moscow’s restriction of supplies. The French delegation in Algeria included Catherine MacGregor, CEO of French energy firm Engie.\n\nJapan holds summit. More than 30 heads of state gathered in Tunisia’s capital, Tunis, over the weekend for the Tokyo International Conference on African Development. The Japanese government created the triennial event—which seeks to limit China’s clout in Africa—in 1993, but this is only the second time it has been held on the continent. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who appeared via video link after testing positive for COVID-19, pledged $30 billion in development aid across Africa over the next three years.\n\nBut the summit triggered a row between Tunisia and Morocco after Tunisian President Kais Saied invited the Polisario Front, which seeks independence for Western Sahara, to participate. Morocco regards the territory as its own and withdrew from the event as a result.\n\nThis Week in Tech\n\nBurkinabe pharma industry. Burkina Faso opened the country’s first pharmaceutical production plant this week. The $23 million plant, run by company Propharm, was built and funded by the country’s private sector and will manufacture generic drugs. It will initially produce basic drugs like paracetamol and rehydration salts but aims to eventually move toward drugs to manage malaria.\n\nAfrican countries import around 70 percent of all medicines used on the continent. Burkina Faso alone imported around $249 million worth of pharmaceutical products last year. Prime Minister Albert Ouédraogo said at the plant’s launch event that “during the COVID-19 period, these issues were important and everyone recognized the need to develop local production of medicines.”\n\nChart of the Week\n\nWavering support for the MPLA in Angola could be a warning of things to come for other independence movements-turned-political parties in southern Africa.\n\nThe MPLA, which fought for Angolan independence from Portuguese rule and agreed to end the country’s civil war in 2002, lost the capital, Luanda, as Angola’s young population demanded a better standard of living and an end to state corruption.\n\nIn South Africa, which holds elections in 2024, the African National Congress could also lose its stronghold, KwaZulu-Natal.\n\nWhat We’re Reading\n\nRethinking Africa’s demography. In The Republic, Yarri Kamara argues that discussions around African countries’ population growth have been limited by a Western framing that fails to take into account the continent’s unique history and demographic nuances.\n\n“Africa’s most populous country Nigeria has a density of 215 [inhabitants per square kilometer], similar to Germany’s. Niger, one of the few countries with a birth rate close to Macron’s alleged ‘seven to eight’ children per woman has a density of just 18,” Kamara writes, referring to comments Macron made in 2017, when he said Africa’s problems stemmed from women having “seven or eight children.”\n\nBlurring the debate are underlying issues around political power, racialized history, and global consumption, Kamara concludes.",

    "South Sudan’s VP Taban Deng arrives in Ethiopia’s capital": "By Tesfa-Alem Tekle\n\nSeptember 21, 2022 (NAIROBI) – South Sudan vice President, Taban Deng Gai, arrived in Addis Ababa for an official working visit on Wednesday.\n\nGai arrived in Addis Ababa this afternoon leading a high-level South Sudanese government delegation.\n\nUpon arrival at Addis Ababa Bole International Airport, the South Sudanese delegation was warmly received by Ethiopian Defence Minister Abraham Belay and Director General of African Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Fisseha Shawul, among other senior government officials.\n\nThe Ethiopia ministry of foreign affairs in a brief statement it issued this afternoon said the high-level delegation will be in Ethiopia for a three-day working visit.\n\n“In the next few days, the delegation that includes various ministers will meet with counterpart ministers and high-level government officials to enhance a wide range of cooperation between the two countries,” the ministry said without giving further details.\n\nHowever, a government source told Sudan Tribune that the latest visit intends to further strengthen the multilateral ties between the two neighbours.\n\nThe agenda for discussion among others will focus on joint infrastructural development, trade, people-to-people ties, and other areas of bilateral and regional concerns, the source told Sudan Tribune.\n\nSouth Sudan and Ethiopia share an 883 km-long common border in the West, yet it is one of the most porous and volatile borderlines.\n\nAlthough bilateral relations between the two countries are considered remarkable in various areas however the two neighbours still need more robust work together to address security challenges, mitigate cross-border conflict, encourage peacebuilding, and bring sustainable development to the border regions.\n\nLast month, Ethiopia and South Sudan signed a security cooperation agreement to jointly fight terrorism, armed groups and related organized crime in the region.\n\nThe agreement was then signed by the Director General of the National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) Temesgen Tiruneh and the Director General of the Internal Security Bureau of South Sudan, Akor Kor Cook.\n\nThe agreement states that “the countries will work together to control and take action against terrorist groups, rebel forces, armed groups and organized criminals who have taken the mission to disrupt peace and security in the border areas and destabilize the East African region.”\n\nIn addition, the two countries agreed to work jointly to curb illegal arms trafficking, drug trafficking, economic fraud and information technology-related crimes.\n\nDiplomatic relations between Addis Ababa and Juba officially began after the latter proclaimed its independence from Sudan in 2011, becoming the world’s youngest nation.\n\nIn the same year, South Sudan promoted its liaison office in Addis Ababa to an Embassy.\n\nRelations between the two neighbours are exhibited in many aspects including people who demonstrate the same ethnic group, culture, religion, and language.\n\nNatural resources, mainly the Nile River, are also another feature that would bond the countries for so many years to come.\n\nIn May, South Sudan agreed to purchase Ethiopia’s cheap and hydro-processed electricity in a bid to meet increasing energy demand at home.\n\nAccording to Ethiopian Electric Power, the power utility, Ethiopia has agreed to export an initial 100 Megawatts of electricity to South Sudan over the next three years.\n\nPer the agreement, Ethiopia will export 100 megawatts of electricity to South Sudan in the first phase of the three-year period and will rise its supply to 400 megawatts of power thereafter.\n\nEthiopia, which is building a multibillion-dollar mega-dam project on the Nile River, is aggressively working to supply electricity to its neighbours as part of regional integration with its neighbours.\n\nHowever, downstream countries, particularly Sudan and Egypt fear that the dam project which would be Africa’s largest could eventually diminish their historic water share from the River.\n\n(ST)",
    "Ethiopia’s Deputy PM meets with Turkey, UK, Mozambique officials – New Business Ethiopia": "Ethiopia’s Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Demeke Mekonnen has met with representatives of United Kingdom, Turkey, and Mozambique on the sideline of UN General Assembly in New York.\n\n\n\nHe discussed with the UK’s Minister of State for Development, Vicky Ford; the Foreign Minister of Turkey, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu and the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Mozambique, Manuel Gonçalves, according to the statement the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ethiopia issued.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe discussions revolved around bilateral and regional issues of mutual interest, noting the need to deepen ties. In the discussion with the UK Minister of State for Development, the two sides noted the need to expedite humanitarian support to people who are affected by drought and conflict.\n\nMr. Demeke’s discussion with the Foreign Minister of Turkey noted the friendly and time-tested relationships that exist between Ethiopia and Turkey which needs to be further strengthened with diversified engagements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his conversation with his Mozambican counterpart, the Deputy Prime Minister said Ethiopia expects Mozambique to play a positive role as a new non-permanent member of the UN Security Council.\n\nThe Foreign Minister of Mozambique thanked Ethiopia for its support in the election and pledged to advocate African issues in line with the maxim of “African solutions to African problems.”\n\nMozambique was elected in June 2022 as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council along with Ecuador, Japan, Malta, and Switzerland, replacing India, Ireland, Kenya, Mexico, and Norway.\n\nThe new non-permanent members of the UN Security Council will take up their positions on the 1st of January 2023.",
    "Horn of Africa Drought: Regional Humanitarian Overview & Call to Action (Revised 21 September 2022) - Ethiopia": "The Horn of Africa Is Facing Its Worst Drought In More than Four Decades, With Catastrophic Consequences\n\nCommunities in the Horn of Africa are facing the immediate threat of starvation, with forecasts indicating that the October-December 2022 rainy season is likely to underperform, marking the fifth consecutive failed season in parts of Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia. The October-December 2020, March-May 2021, October-December 2021 and March-May 2022 seasons were all marred by below-average rainfall, leaving large swathes of Somalia, southern and south-eastern Ethiopia, and northern and eastern Kenya facing the most prolonged drought in recent history, while the March-May 2022 rainy season was the driest on record in the last 70 years. The 2020-2022 drought has now surpassed the horrific droughts in 2010-2011 and 2016-2017 in both duration and severity and will continue to deepen in the months ahead, with catastrophic consequences.\n\nAn Unprecedented Emergency Is Ravaging Drought-Affected Communities\n\nAcross the Horn of Africa, at least 36.1 million people will be affected by severe drought in October 2022, including 24.1 million in Ethiopia, 7.8 million in Somalia and 4.2 million in Kenya. This represents a significant increase from July 2022 (when an estimated 19.4 million people were affected), reflecting the impact of the drought in additional areas of Ethiopia and rising needs in Somalia and Kenya.\n\nTwo districts in Somalia are at imminent risk of famine and at least 21 million people are projected to face high levels of acute food insecurity due to drought in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia between October and December 2022.\n\nIn Somalia, 6.7 million people will likely experience high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above) from October to December, including over 300,000 in Catastrophic (IPC Phase 5) conditions, while people in rural areas of Baidoa and Burhakaba districts and displaced people in Baidoa town of Bay region are at risk of famine. About 9.9 million people in Ethiopia are severely food insecure due to the drought, according to the Drought Response Plan. In Kenya, some 4.35 million people are expected to face acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 and above) between October and December 2022, according to the Long Rains Season Assessment. With the October to December 2022 rains projected to fail, food insecurity will rise in the months ahead, and between 23 and 26 million people will likely face acute food insecurity due to the Horn of Africa drought by February 2023, according to the Food Security and Nutrition Working Group (FSNWG).\n\nOver 8.9 million livestock—which pastoralist families rely upon for sustenance and livelihoods—have died across the region, including 3.5 million in Ethiopia, 2.4 million in Kenya and over 3 million in Somalia, according to the latest FSNWG Drought Special Report. This translates to the loss of 120 million litres of milk, leaving 1.6 million children under age 5 across the region without a daily glass of milk, according to FAO, with severe consequences for their nutrition. The severity and duration of this drought present an existential threat to pastoralist communities in the hardest-hit areas. Experience shows that it takes at least five years for a pastoralist family to rebuild their herd after a drought. However, with many families having lost all of their livestock during this drought, and droughts becoming more frequent and intense in the Horn of Africa, some may be forced to leave pastoralism.\n\nFood prices are spiking in many drought-affected areas, due to a combination of macro-economic challenges, below-average harvests and rising prices for food and fuel on international markets, including as a result of the war in Ukraine. In Somalia, staple food prices in drought-hit areas have surpassed the levels recorded during the 2017 drought and the 2011 famine, according to WFP’s price monitoring. In Ethiopia, the cost of the local food basket increased by more than 33 per cent between January and June 2022, according to WFP. Soaring prices are leaving families unable to afford even basic items and forcing them to sell their hard-earned properties and assets in exchange for food and other life-saving items. There are also repercussions for food for refugee programmes, which are already impacted by reduced rations due to lack of funding support.\n\nAcross the three countries, the drought is driving alarming levels of malnutrition for children and women. About 4.9 million children are acutely malnourished in drought-affected areas, of whom 2.2 million are in Ethiopia , about 884,500 in Kenya and 1.8 million in Somalia. This includes about 1.4 million children who are severely acutely malnourished, including 704,500 in Ethiopia1, 222,700 in Kenya and 513,550 in Somalia. In addition, an estimated 986,000 pregnant and lactating women are acutely malnourished, including 685,900 in Ethiopia, 115,700 in Kenya and 184,400 in Somalia. Across the region, many women have sacrificed their own wellbeing and nutrition to care for their families.\n\nMore than 16.2 million people cannot access enough water for drinking, cooking and cleaning across the Horn of Africa, including 8.2 million in Ethiopia, 3.9 million in Somalia and 4.1 million in Kenya, according to UNICEF. Many water points have dried up or diminished in quality, heightening the risk of water-borne diseases and increasing the risk of skin and eye infections as families are forced to ration their water use and prioritize drinking and cooking over hygiene. Water deficits have been exacerbated by very high temperatures, which are forecast to continue until at least September 2022. Women and girls are having to walk longer distances to access water—in many instances up to double or triple the distances they would walk during a regular dry season—exacerbating their potential exposure to gender-based violence and dehydration. Water shortages are also impacting infection prevention and control in health facilities and schools. In Ethiopia and Kenya, there are reports of an increase in pregnant women being exposed to infections—the worst of which have resulted in death— following deliveries both at home and at health facilities due to the limited availability of water.\n\nThe drought is increasing the risk of disease and having devastating consequences for the health of affected communities. All three countries that have been hardest-hit by the drought are responding to cholera outbreaks, with 11,500 cases recorded in the first eight months of 2022, including 9,700 in Somalia alone. Measles is also on the rise, with 20,500 cases reported across the three countries from January to August in 2022. Malnutrition and disease have a synergistic relationship, with malnutrition increasing the likelihood of falling sick—especially for children and pregnant and lactating women—while sick people become more easily malnourished, according to WHO. As the price of food rises, families may be forced to choose between food and health care, increasing the risk of people discontinuing treatment, including for HIV. At the same time, displacement can heighten the risk of exposure to disease, due to compromised living conditions, while also increasing the potential spread of disease, including across borders.\n\nFamilies are taking desperate measures to survive, with more than 1.3 million people leaving their homes in search of food, pasture, water and alternative livelihoods, increasing the risk of inter-communal conflict, as well as heightening pressure on already limited basic services. Since January 2021, over 1 million people in Somalia have been displaced: some have migrated to near-by towns, joining existing camps for internally displaced people, while others have crossed borders seeking support or traversed dangerous distances controlled by armed groups and contaminated with explosives in search of work or humanitarian assistance. Around 20,000 people from Somalia have sought asylum in Ethiopia (16,000) and Kenya (4,000), including due to the drought, by the end of June 2022, according to UNHCR. In Ethiopia, over 345,000 people were forced from their homes between October 2021 and June 2022 due to the worsening drought, especially in Somali Region (175,000) and Southern Oromia (163,000). In the ASAL region of Kenya, pastoralists are trekking long distances to find water and pasture for livestock, leading to resource-based and inter-communal tensions and conflict and there are growing reports of people arriving into urban and peri-urban areas—including the sides of major roads—in search of new livelihoods and assistance.\n\nThe drought is having devastating consequences for women and children, heightening the risk of gender-based violence and sexual exploitation and abuse, and hampering children’s access to education. Risks of gender-based violence— including sexual violence, sexual exploitation, intimate partner violence and female genital mutilation—are increasing during this crisis, while services to respond remain limited. Female-headed households and adolescent girls are particularly vulnerable to increased violence, exploitation and abuse. In Somalia, a 20 per cent increase in incidents of intimate partner violence and rape was reported between January and May 2022 through the GBV Information Management System (GBVIMS), correlated with the drought. In some communities, child marriage has reportedly risen, with families marrying-off young girls in order to lessen demands on their own resources and potentially get money that they can use for food and other necessities. In some communities, families have stopped sending girls to school, prioritizing boys as they cannot afford the school fees. In Somalia, the drought emergency has disrupted education for 1.7 million children, of whom 720,000—47 per cent of them girls—are at risk of dropping out of school. In Ethiopia, more than 482,000 children are out of school due to drought. In Kenya, more than 54,500 students in the 17 drought- affected counties are at risk of dropping out of school unless urgent multi-sectoral measures are taken to provide school supplies, school meals and safe and sufficient water.\n\nOlder people—especially in pastoralist communities—are also facing unique consequences due to the drought. Their role in caring for children has increased, as younger adults have travelled further afield in search of forage and food or migrated to urban areas in search of work. Some 88 per cent of older people caring for at least one child, with the average caring for more than five children. Many older people are skipping meals—with over half currently eating only one meal per day and 82 per cent going to bed hungry at least one night per week—and only 1 in 2 older people have access to safe drinking water, according to a recent assessment by HelpAge.\n\nWhile resilience-building efforts across the region have made important progress, the frequency and severity of droughts in recent years, combined with the exceptionally prolonged nature of the 2020-2022 drought, have made it harder and harder for families to recover between shocks. In the past 10 years alone, the Horn of Africa has endured three severe droughts (2010-2011, 2016-2017 and 2020-2022). The 2010-2011 drought, combined with conflict and complex humanitarian access issues, caused famine in Somalia. The 2016-2017 drought brought millions of people in the region to the brink of famine, which was only prevented through rapid and timely humanitarian response. The increasing frequency of shocks in the region has meant that the vulnerable have little space to recover and bounce back, leading to an increase in the number of internally displaced people.\n\nAt the same time, many drought-affected communities are struggling to cope with the cumulative consequences of other shocks, including conflict, flooding, COVID-19 and desert locusts. Previously, many of these communities were hit by the extreme rains and flooding which struck the region in 2019, and which was one of the drivers of the historical desert locust outbreak which began in late-2019. The Horn of Africa has also been negatively impacted by the deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and trade disruptions related to the war in Ukraine, at a time when households are still facing the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on livelihoods and income sources. In addition, millions of people in Ethiopia and Somalia are affected by conflicts, which may also hinder people’s freedom of movement as they seek reprieve from the drought.\n\nEven if no famine emerges in Somalia, given the large number of people affected and the likely duration of the crisis, excess mortality during this drought could be as high as in 2011. Over 730 children died in nutrition centres across Somalia in the first eight months of 2022 and, across the Horn of Africa, there are multiple areas where global acute malnutrition rates are more than double the emergency threshold, heightening the risk of death",
    "Three top businesses in Ethiopia for US companies – New Business Ethiopia": "Below is an overview of the industries with the best prospects, big government purchases, infrastructure projects, and commercial opportunities as suggested by the US International Trade Administration.\n\n\n\nAgricultural equipment, computer equipment, food goods, machinery, trucks, and vehicle/vehicle components are among the top American exports to Ethiopia (non-electrical). Ethiopia’s infrastructure, energy, aviation, healthcare, and tourism sectors, as well as agriculture and geoprocessing, present the most attractive business potential.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment procurement\n\nThe largest consumer and market for American products is the Government of Ethiopia (GOE) and its public institutions. The GOE makes significant investments in significant social and economic infrastructure projects, such as power generation, industrial parks and zones, housing development, water and irrigation, roads and railways, airports and dry ports, telecommunication and internet networks, as well as fertilizer manufacturing facilities.\n\nThere are opportunities for American businesses to take part in government procurements. American businesses rely largely on high-level advocacy help to gain government contracts or reverse unfair or opaque tender awards caused by flaws in the tendering process.\n\nThe GOE is open to suggestions for tender bids that include financing alternatives. Normally, bidders that do not offer 100% finance are at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, there have reportedly been problems with unfairness and lack of openness in the evaluation of tenders. Therefore, before the tender assessment process, bidders should think about collaborating with the Commercial Service Ethiopia and using the U.S. Commerce Department advocacy procedure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy confirming three of its board of directors, the U.S. Senate restored the U.S. Exim bank’s full financing capacity in 2019. With increasing capacity, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation’s successor organization, the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), has demonstrated a greater interest in funding projects in Ethiopia with U.S. equity investment.\n\nAgriculture\n\nEthiopia offers a wealth of agricultural resources and a variety of natural zones where agriculture can be grown. Land can be leased for up to 99 years from regional and city administration bureaus, and investment licenses can be obtained from the Ethiopian Investment Commission.\n\nIn terms of equity and transparency, the GOE has recently faced substantial challenges with regard to land distribution, compensation, and relocation. The respect for land rights also differs within Ethiopia due to the country’s strong regional autonomy. Before making investments requiring land use and/or migration, American businesses should conduct their due diligence.\n\nOne of the most important industries for Ethiopia’s economic development and progress is energy. In the medium term, we anticipate a major growth in power production. Ethiopia has a lot of potential for renewable energy, particularly hydroelectric (renewable sources now provide over 90% of Ethiopia’s energy needs), and it wants to take advantage of these resources by expanding the installed capacity of renewable energy sources.\n\nAviation\n\nThe GOE publishes tenders for a number of renewable energy projects, with the project quality and experience being the main criteria for tender evaluation.\n\nWith an average growth rate of 20%, the aviation industry is experiencing rapid expansion due to the rising demand for both passenger and freight air travel. The expansion of cargo transport operations has allowed the industry to keep expanding throughout the COVID pandemic.\n\nGiven that operational capacity may regain 80% to 100% of its pre-crisis capacity as opposed to 70% of its pre-pandemic capacity, FY/2022 is anticipated to be better for the sector than FY/2021.\n\nContinental free trade area\n\nThe 55 African nations that have signed the Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA), which went into effect in January 2021, are now a part of a single trading region. Ethiopia has approved the AfCFTA, boosting trade between Ethiopia and other countries on the continent. U.S. businesses now have the chance to use Ethiopia as a regional trade hub to access adjacent countries thanks to the AfCFTA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AU is mandated to seek continental integration as one of its key priorities, as stated in its long-term strategy Agenda 2063. The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which went into effect in January 2021, was established by the AU to accomplish this purpose. The AfCFTA aspires to integrate Africa’s economies, unify rules, and lower trade obstacles like tariffs.\n\nBy the middle of 2021, the AfCFTA had been ratified by 43 nations and had been signed by 54 AU members. The chapters of the AfCFTA will influence trade and investment in critical areas, including products and services, intellectual property rights, investment, competition policy, and digital commerce, for U.S. businesses doing business in Africa.\n\nBy offering technical assistance to the AU and encouraging U.S. private sector participation with the AU on the AfCFTA, the U.S. Mission to the AU (USAU) supports the AfCFTA, according to the US International Trade Administration’s Country Commercial Guide",
    "Ethiopian Airlines wins multiple awards – New Business Ethiopia": "Ethiopian Airlines, the largest Aviation Group in Africa, announced that it has been named the winner of four awards at the SKYTRAX 2022 World Airline Awards, at a ceremony held in London on 23 September 2022.

    "Gunmen kill dozens in Ethiopia’s Oromia region: Report": "Witnesses say at least 42 people have been killed as clashes between the Oromo and Amhara groups escalate.\n\nGunmen killed at least 42 people in Ethiopia’s Oromia region, two residents who buried the bodies in mass graves have told Reuters news agency, amid escalating violence that has left hundreds dead.\n\nThe latest attack by an armed group against local residents occurred on Tuesday in the Amuru district, about 370km (230 miles) west of the capital, Addis Ababa.\n\nThe witnesses on Friday said the victims were all Oromos and described the attackers as members of a volunteer group known as Fano, mostly composed of ethnic Amharas.\n\nOne resident, who spoke to Reuters by telephone but asked not to be named, said locals had buried 22 people in one place, 15 in another, and five in a third spot.\n\nThe second resident said he compiled a list of 46 dead.\n\nBoth said the attackers carried rifles and numbered between 150 and 200. They were speaking Amharic and wore a mishmash of uniforms.\n\nClashes between the Oromo and the Amhara, Ethiopia’s two largest ethnic groups, have been rising in recent months.\n\nThe Oromia region has experienced years of violence amid accusations of neglect by the federal government in Addis Ababa.\n\nOromos account for more than a third of Ethiopia’s total population of about 110 million.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethiopian and Eritrean government forces on Thursday launched an attack in Ethiopia’s northern region of Tigray, targeting rebel forces.\n\nTigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) spokesman Getachew Reda said both nations’ forces had attacked rebels in Adayabo in the north of the region.\n\nThe conflict resumed last week after a five-month lull, with clashes on the ground and air raids over Tigray dashing hopes of peacefully resolving the nearly two-year-long war.\n\nTPLF, the party that controls Tigray, dominated the government for nearly three decades until Abiy Ahmed became prime minister in 2018. The TPLF accuses Abiy of centralising power at the expense of the regions, an accusation he denies.\n\nThe United States on Friday pledged to send a special envoy to Ethiopia this weekend as part of its calls for fighting to end in Tigray.",
    "Ethiopia’s Industrial Hopes Dwindle as Conflict, Sanctions Take Toll": "Ethiopia once said it wanted to become the \"China of Africa\" — that is, a manufacturing hub — with the help of its industrial parks. But the global economic downturn and the country's ongoing conflict have prompted companies to leave the parks and lay off thousands of workers.\n\nThe Ethiopian government hoped that one the country’s industrial parks — Hawassa, which was opened in 2016 with the potential to create 60,000 jobs — would help the country move from an agricultural to a manufacturing economy, and that the companies operating there would bring high-tech work.\n\nKalkidan Asrat, a logistics manager Nasa Garment at the Hawassa Industrila Park, shared those dreams.\n\nHer birthplace, she said, is a small town and her family worked in agriculture for a living as subsistence farmers. When she completed her education, she joined the industrial park, where she said she was able to improve her prospects.\n\nThere are 10 other industrial parks like Hawassa spread across Ethiopia.\n\nThe government has said it hoped to make Ethiopia a lower middle-income country by 2025, with manufacturing playing a big part.\n\nThat is now looking less likely because of the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation, a lack of foreign currency in the country, and conflict and human rights abuses.\n\n\"Two of the industrial parks have been directly impacted. They’ve been in the combat zone, effectively,” said emerging markets economist Patrick Heinisch. “The most severe hit to the industrial parks is from the loss of access to AGOA. One week after the announcement, the first company announced they would retreat from the Ethiopian market; they sold their factories in Ethiopia. This has been followed by other companies.\"\n\nThe African Growth and Opportunity Act, or AGOA, passed in the U.S. in 2000 to aid development in sub-Saharan Africa, gave Ethiopia duty-free access to the U.S. market for several products.\n\nWith Ethiopian wages much lower than those in China, a country synonymous with manufacturing, and AGOA making it cheaper to import goods to the U.S., many international manufacturing companies set up in Hawassa’s industrial sheds.\n\nOn January 1, however, the U.S. withdrew Ethiopia’s access to AGOA due to “gross violations of human rights.”\n\nRights groups have accused the Ethiopian government and its aligned military forces of large-scale human abuses, including ethnic cleansing, against Tigrayans during the country’s nearly two-year conflict.\n\nTigrayan forces have also been accused of abuses.\n\nThirty-five thousand people worked at Hawassa, but in June, one firm laid off 3,000 workers and others laid off hundreds.\n\nOne factory owner in Hawassa, Raghavendra Pattar, said the country is struggling to adapt.\n\n\"We are forging towards a new market, but it will take more time to roll up the market again, so that’s why we are suffering a lot,” he said. “The country is suffering because of foreign currency availability in the country today. They also need support from other countries, big countries, like America.”\n\nThe deputy general manager of the park, Belante Tebikew, said the withdrawal of AGOA was causing more problems than the pandemic or inflation.\n\n“There are some, as I told you, reductions on orders, because they are being injured by the customs, duty-free privileges in the American markets, since most of the commodities are being exported to the U.S.,” he said.\n\nIn another bad sign for the country’s economy, fighting between government and Tigrayan rebel forces broke out again in late August after a five-month cease-fire.",
    "Ethiopia Flood Response Plan - 2022 Kiremt Season Floods (August 2022) - Ethiopia": "SITAUTION\n\nThe Ethiopia Meteorology Institute weather outlook for the 2022 kiremt season (June – September) indicated a very high probability of wetter climate condition in the southwest, western, northern, and central parts of the country in July and August. Overall, the rainfall is expected to peak in August, and gradually decline during September in almost all kiremt rain-receiving areas of the country. More specifically, normal to above normal rainfall is expected across the northern half of the country.\n\nThe 2022 kiremt season rainfall started on time in June. As per the Ethiopia Meteorology Institute weather assessment report, light to heavy rainfall was recorded in most parts of Tigray, Amhara, western and central Oromia, Benishangul Gumuz, southwest Ethiopia people,\n\nSNNP, Sidama, Gambella, Southern highlands and eastern parts of the country such as north Somali, Harari, Dire Dawa and Afar regions.\n\nSome of these areas received heavy rains with storm and thunder.\n\nFollowing the Ethiopia Meteorology Institute’s (EMI) 2022 kiremt weather outlook, the National Flood Taskforce issued Flood Alert No 1, 2 and 3 in April, June and August 2022 respectively. The Flood Alerts are intended to enhance community awareness, preparedness and mitigation measures in areas at risk of flooding and to minimize the cost of damages on people’s lives and livelihoods. The Flood Task Force also prepared a Flood Contingency Plan (CP) to mitigate the adverse impacts of current and anticipated floods and to support resource mobilization, which identified the most likely scenario or worst-case scenario based on the weather forecast and analysis of the preparedness and response capacity of the affected areas. The Contingency Plan also stipulated flood-related requirements by sector, including other mitigation and preparedness efforts. Based on the Ethiopia Meteorology Institute (EMI) weather outlook, Regional Flood Contingency Plans (2022), kiremt season analogue year (1985 and 2000) and flood incidences historical data, the Contingency Plan identified flood and landslide risk areas in all regions between June and August 2022, following heavy kiremt rainfall received in the northwestern, western and central parts of the country. The heavy rains caused an increase in the water levels of dams, flash flood and river floods in different areas of the country, including Addis Ababa, Amhara (Libo Kemkem, Dera, Fogera, Gonder Zuria Bure and East Dembia woredas and parts of Oromo Zone), and Gambella (Itang Woreda). According to the Amhara regional report, about 94 houses and 14,291 hectares of crop field were damaged in 15 woredas as a result of flash and river floods since July 2022. In East Dembia, it was reported that 365 houses were inundated, and 48 houses were surrounded by flood water.\n\nFurthermore, current dam reservoir levels of Koka, Fincha’a, Gilgel Gibe, Tana Beles and Rib have already increased because of the heavy rains in the watersheds. Meanwhile, the timely onset of 2022 kiremt season reportedly benefited agricultural activities (planting of short maturing crops), pasture regeneration and water replenishment.\n\nThere are increasing concerns over the likelihood that the ongoing floods will force humanitarian partners to flex their limited resources, which were originally planned for other purposes (e.g. conflict displacement) to meet the immediate needs of those displaced by flooding. The current floods and anticipated continuation of rains could also impact some of the IDP sites located in flood risk areas. A reduction in kiremt harvest is also expected as arable land become submerged in flood waters. Slow receding flood waters are also likely to increase the incidents of malaria and acute watery diarrhea (AWD), as flood affected populations are sometimes forced to drink from open water sources.",

Now, trucks have delivered a portion of that wheat to the World Food Program's main warehouse in Ethiopia, where food aid is desperately needed.\n\nThe World Food Program said the 23,000 tons of grain is enough to feed 1.5 million people on full rations for a month.\n\nSome of the grain is destined for Somalia, which like the rest of the Horn of Africa is reeling from severe drought.\n\nWhile it is not clear how much grain is going to Ethiopia, the WFP has said it hopes to reach 11.5 million Ethiopians in need by the end of 2022.\n\nThe WFP said food needs to continue to flow in for that to happen. Ukrainian food exports were cut off for months until Ukraine and Russia reached an U.N.-backed agreement last month to open a corridor for the free flow of food shipments.\n\nThe WFP says this is the first humanitarian aid shipment from Ukraine to arrive in Ethiopia under the agreement.\n\nEthiopia is experiencing drought and conflict in the northern Tigray region which have put more than 20 million people nationwide in need of humanitarian assistance.\n\nThe recently renewed clashes between the government forces and the rebel Tigray People’s Liberation Front have displaced more people, and the lack of access to some areas has complicated relief efforts.",
    "News: Women march in capital adds to growing calls for peace in Ethiopia": "Women march in Addis Abeba calling for peace. Picture: Social Media\n\nAddis Abeba – A peace rally was held in Addis Abeba on Thursday 08 August organized by three women-centered indigenous civil society organizations based in Ethiopia. The march for peace adds up to the rare, yet growing calls from non-state actors calling for an end and a peaceful resolution to the ongoing civil war in Ethiopia.\n\nSeveral women organized by the Network of Ethiopian Women’s Associations (NEWA), the Strategic Initiative for Women in the Horn of Africa (SIHA) Network, and Timran, marched in the capital carrying banners with messages of peace, the role of women in peace, as well as condemning war-related rape and sexual assault against women. Some of the messages in the banners read “no disagreement has ever found solution through war”, “women’s body is not a battlefield”, and “war is not an instrument of development but of death, hunger, migration and destruction.”\n\nThis is the second call for peace in Ethiopia in as many days echoed by local civic organizations after a group of 35 local CSOs issued a statement on 07 September calling for immediate peace in Ethiopia, restorations of basic services provision in Tigray and other conflict hit areas, investigations and accountability to war-related crimes being committed in Ethiopia and an end to ethnic-based violence and discrimination in various parts of the country, among others.\n\nLast week, both the Ethiopian Teachers Association and the Ethiopian Civil Societies Organization Coalition (ECSOC) called for de-escalation and an immediate return to cessation of hostilities after the resumption of militarized hostilities between federal defense forces and Tigrayan forces.\n\nThe Association said that the war would bring nothing to Ethiopia except for poverty and generational rifts, while the Coalition warned that it would bear massive consequences for civilians, especially vulnerable segments of the population, namely children, disabled persons, the elderly, and women in the affected areas.\n\nThe resumption of the militarized hostilities on 24 August has already been condemned by the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC), multiple countries and institutions and their leaders including The United States, Turkey, UN Secretary-General António Guterres, and AU Chairperson, Moussa Faki, who have raised concerns in regard to the situation and stressed a resumption of peace talks.\n\nDespite widespread calls however, the war has continued in the backdrop of absence of independently verifiable reports.

(AP Photo)\n\nNAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Once home to one of Africa’s fastest-growing economies, Ethiopia is struggling as the war in its Tigray region has reignited and weary citizens far from the front are pleading for peace.\n\nEthiopians are experiencing the highest inflation in a decade, foreign exchange restrictions and mounting debt amid reports of massive government spending on the war effort. Parliament early this year reportedly approved an additional $1.7 billion budget for defense.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, a drone strike hit a university campus in Tigray’s capital, Mekele, causing an unknown number of injuries, according to a media worker there who spoke on condition of anonymity because he didn’t have authorization to speak to other outlets. He said another drone strike also destroyed the station of regional broadcaster Dimtsi Woyane.\n\nEthiopian officials continue to paint a rosy picture for the country of well over 110 million people. “Our economy has continued to grow amid natural and man-made problems,” the planning and development minister, Fitsum Assefa, said earlier this month.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut the Ethiopian Economic Association’s meeting this month made clear the country is hurting, while international mediators urgently seek progress on talks to end the fighting.\n\nBecause of internal conflicts, the destruction of infrastructure and uncontrolled spending are hurting the economy while ordinary Ethiopians face weakening incomes and rising poverty, economist Alemayehu Seyoum told the meeting.\n\nEthiopia once seared into the global consciousness with a devastating famine in the 1980s. The country has since transformed its economy with mega-projects like the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, the largest in Africa, and large-scale construction projects in Addis Ababa, Africa’s diplomatic capital.\n\nThe economy grew at an average of 11% over the past decade.\n\nBut the war in the northern Tigray region, which began in late 2020, has caused immense disruption. In June, the International Monetary Fund said growth likely fell to 3.8% for 2021-2022 because of the war and a “sharp fall in donor financing,” among other factors.\n\nThe finance ministry has declined to approve the financing of three industrial parks, symbols of Ethiopia’s China-like development, citing “budgetary pressure.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nInstead, the economy has shifted to a war focus.\n\nThe finance ministry now pleads with the public and Ethiopia’s large diaspora to contribute to a “national cause” for war reconstruction and aid. Ethiopia’s National Bank introduced changes to give the government all possible access to foreign currency, including requiring foreign residents to convert all in their possession upon entry.\n\nCertain development works continue, including Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s flagship projects like the beautification of the capital.\n\nBut some critics such as the spokesman for the outlawed Oromo Liberation Army, Odaa Tarbii, say “vanity projects” are not necessary now.\n\nAnything seen as criticism of the war can be stifled. Last week, authorities blocked 31 local civil society groups from organizing a media briefing calling for peace.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFollowing criticism that its financial support was enabling the government’s war efforts, the World Bank last week said it will continue its partnership but expressed concern.\n\nSome state-run sectors of Ethiopia’s economy continue to open to investors, as Abiy promised after taking office. The cabinet this month approved the entry of foreign banks, a significant step.\n\nEthiopia’s ambassador to the United States, Seleshi Bekele, said the “international community should support this initiative by helping to disarm the hostile (Tigray forces).”\n\nU.S. special envoy Mike Hammer was again in Ethiopia last week to “discuss the urgency of immediate cessation of hostilities,” according to the State Department, which said “the Ethiopian people have suffered tremendously from this conflict.”\n\nEthiopia’s government was unsettled when the U.S. last year removed it from a preferential trade program over its failure to end the war in Tigray that the U.S. said led to “gross violations” of human rights. Addis Ababa is lobbying for a reversal.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSince then, global companies like PVH Corp have left Ethiopia, citing security reasons, and others are laying off thousands of employees.\n\nEthiopian Airlines, the largest aviation group in Africa, remains one of the country’s few profitable companies but has been accused by Tigray forces of transporting troops and weapons to the war front. The airline has denied it.\n\nInside Tigray, millions of residents are still largely cut off from the world. Communications and banking services are severed, and their restoration has been a key demand in mediation efforts.\n\nAn agricultural survey conducted in several accessible parts of Tigray last month by Mekele University personnel, shared with The Associated Press, found many crops were failing because of the lack of fertilizer. Even traveling had become “tiresome” because of the lack of fuel, the survey said.\n\nOther shortages are deadly. In an email to the AP, the head of the Tigray health bureau said vaccines for children ran out more than a year ago, and women don’t have family planning supplies. Humanitarian deliveries have stopped because of the renewed fighting.\n\n“The list is very long. I just don’t want to bore you with the details,” Amanuel Haile wrote. “The above are just enough.”",
    "Providing clean water in Ethiopia – A leap to a better life - Ethiopia": "Many communities in Ethiopia are faced with a lack of access to clean water sources. Less than half the population has access to safe water daily. With funding from the European Union, People In Need, PIN, is running water development activities focused on increasing the availability of safe water in the Konso zone, in the Southern Nations and Nationalities People's Region, SNNPR, in southwest Ethiopia.\n\nKonso experiences acute water shortages, and the local population often travels for hours to fetch safe water. Following recent ethnic conflicts in the area, hundreds of Internally Displaced People have temporarily settled in the region, creating additional stress on already limited water resources.\n\nTo address this situation, we have launched a water development project with support from the European Union's Humanitarian Aid department. So far, more than 8,300 inhabitants have benefited from safe and drinkable water provided by the project in the Segen Zuria Woreda and the Lultu and Aylotadokatu Kebeles.\n\nShallow wells are improving access to drinking water Kuyow Zemedu, a father of two, works as a coordinator of potable water maintenance in Segen Zuria Woreda. He also works as a government focal point for information and assistance for our shallow wells and borehole rehabilitation projects.\n\n“There is a water shortage in the area. Rivers and ponds are the major source of water for our cattle and us. These water sources expose the community to water-borne diseases, mainly diarrhoea, typhoid, and typhus. This has led to many health problems, especially among the children,” he said.\n\n\"Apart from the benefit of the water being within a short walking distance, there is also a lot of improvement among the community members in regard to personal hygiene. People have started to wash their hands and clothes and to constantly make their lives better.\"\n\nAccording to Kuyow, the water projects have brought multidimensional changes to the lives of the villagers. Each shallow well is managed by a committee composed of two women and three men. This composition enables women to develop their leadership skills and apply them within their communities.\n\nRelief for many women and girls\n\nWomen and girls typically spend hours on the tiresome task of carrying jerrycans for several hours per day. It was part of their day-to-day routine. Shakaya Sikanayta, a mother of three children and resident of Gocha, added: “We used to travel for more than three hours to fetch water from ponds and rivers, often carrying 40 litres of water in jerrycans. My children often got sick from water-borne diseases and were not healthy.” She spent much of her time and energy fetching water.\n\nNow things have changed. Shakaya only walks for a few minutes to get clean water and does not constantly worry about her children's health.\n\n18-year-old Tirunesh Kenkensha is also another beneficiary of the project. “I used to fetch water from the Keto River once or twice a day, a three-hour round trip from my village. On such days, I would miss my classes,” notes Tirunesh.\n\nRecently, Tirunesh started a new business, brewing Cheka, a fermented drink loved and consumed by locals. She is hopeful that the new business will bring her good fortune.\n\n“I plan to expand my business as I have enough water on my doorstep. And I am thankful for that.”\n\nTo make the water service sustainable, villagers contribute 10 birr per household per month. The money is kept for maintenance and other expenses.\n\nAuthor: Setotaw Tadesse Girma",
    "Ethiopia Drought Response July - December 2022 (Revised) - Ethiopia": "Crisis Overview\n\nThe first reiteration of the Drought Response Plan was developed in April 2022 as an extract of the Ethiopia Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) for 2022 using the information available at the time. By the end of June more data became available indicating the worsening drought conditions and expansion to other regions. This revised plan takes in consideration the new data available and expand the scope of the response to the new areas affected by the drought and reviews the response strategy and resources needed to respond to the growing needs until the end of the year. It is expected that the situation will continue to evolve over the next few months. This plan will serve to organize and monitor the drought response until the end of 2022. This drought response plan is an integral part of the Ethiopia HRP 2022 and will be integrated with the HRP mid-year review to be carried out in August.\n\nA worsening and expanding drought over the last few months expected to continue in the coming months – Following four consecutive failed rainy seasons in parts of Ethiopia, the drought impact has continued to worsen and expand over the last few months with more areas affected, notably in Afar.\n\nRecent weather forecasts point towards a higher likelihood that the upcoming deyr/hageya rainy season (October – December 2022) will also be below-average, making it an unprecedented fifth consecutive failed rainy season. Already, owing to the revised methodology used for revising this plan to strengthen the identification of drought-affected areas, the number of affected woredas increased from 157 in the first iteration of the Drought Response Plan to 391 by the end of June.\n\nAt present, there are 16.99 million who will be targeted for multi-sector lifesaving assistance for the rest of the year. This is an increase from 8.1 million people targeted in the last iteration of the Drought Response Plan, more than doubling of the affected population identified at the beginning of the year.\n\nOver the recent years, drought-affected pastoralist and agro-pastoralist communities in southern and eastern Ethiopia have suffered from the impact of multiple and often recurring shocks. In addition to four back-to-back failed rainy seasons since late 2020 (the worst in the last 40 years), these communities have endured the impact of desert locust infestations, conflict and disease outbreaks, including COVID-19 pandemic and previous droughts episodes notably in 2017 and 2011. Likewise, the expansion and continuation of the drought has not only affected more people, it has also increased significantly the severity of their needs and eroded any remaining resilience mechanisms almost completely. In addition, the drought has expanded to areas that have also been affected by conflict in Northern Ethiopia, notably in Afar region, or violence in other part of the country, notably in Oromia and SNNP regions, subjecting affecting people to increase vulnerability.\n\nThe impact of the drought on the livelihoods of affected communities is already devastating and is expected to further worsen in the second half of 2022 increasing the severity of needs. Recent weather forecasts point towards a higher likelihood that the upcoming deyr/ hageya rainy season (October – December 2022) will also be below-average, making it an unprecedented fifth consecutive failed rainy season. The drought impact continued to worsen and to expand over the last few months with more areas affected, notably in 9,788 Afar. According to the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET), “pasture conditions are among the driest on record, with few to no migration options. implementing response activities. Subsequently, an estimated 3.5 million livestock have died between late 2021 and mid-May 2022, and herd sizes are likely to decline further given very limited livestock births this season and high offtake expected during the upcoming dry season.\" An additional 25 million weakened and emaciated livestock are also at risk of deaths, which is a devastation for a population heavily reliant on livestock for nutrition, notably for children, and income.\n\nDue to the limited food and milk availability for children, coupled with poor health and limited or no health and nutrition services, acute malnutrition rate amongst children has surpassed the emergency threshold in most areas. According to FEWS NET, “Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Emergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes exist across southern and southeastern areas, and there is a risk of more extreme outcomes – marked by Extremely Critical levels of acute malnutrition and high levels of hunger-related mortality – without sustained, large-scale assistance.” At present, around 9.9 million people require food assistance and 2.9 million children and pregnant and lactating women require nutrition interventions until the end of the year. The level of water scarcity is alarming for both livestock and human consumption. Surface water continues to dry up, while groundwater levels continue to decrease, and the population is traveling longer distances to reach water points. More than 13 million people need WASH assistance in drought affected areas.\n\nThe risk of gender-based violence (GBV) has also increased as women and girls are forced to travel far distances to fetch water, while in other cases they are often left alone while family members are away looking for food or livelihood. Recent inter-sectoral assessments show an increase in psychosocial distress, especially among children and caregivers, and negative survival strategies. Child labor, street begging and an increase in the number of school dropouts and early marriage cases were observed in drought-affected areas. Cases of family separation and of serious neglect of children, older persons and persons with disability were reported as well.\n\nRecent inter-sectoral assessments show an increase in psychosocial distress, especially among children and caregivers, as well as in the resort to negative survival strategies. Child labor, street begging and an increase in the number of school dropouts and early marriage cases were observed in drought-affected areas. Based on Government data and UNICEF Analysis (May 2022), the number of child marriage cases has increased by 264 per cent in Somali, by 69 per cent in Oromia and by 38 per cent in SNNP – all regions severely affected by drought – compared to the same period (January- April) last year. Cases of family separation and of serious neglect of children, older persons and persons with disability were reported as well.\n\nWith the worsening conditions, hundreds and thousands of people continue to migrate in search of water, pasture, and assistance. leaving behind their elderly and sick family members. Further movements are anticipated in the months to come as the drought is expected to progress. Movement of communities heightens the risk of disease transmission (both for humans and livestock) due to high population concentration and weakened immunity.
