    "USTDA Assists Thailand’s Fight Against Cancer": "USTDA Assists Thailand’s Fight Against Cancer\n\nThe U.S. Trade and Development Agency announced it awarded a grant to Thailand’s AMATA Corporation Public Company Limited (AMATA) for a feasibility study to develop a regional oncology center in Chonburi Province. USTDA’s assistance will advance AMATA’s and Thailand’s goal of providing access to world-class cancer treatment to hundreds of thousands of people across the Lower Mekong Region.\n\n“Improving access to quality healthcare is one USTDA’s top priorities in Thailand and other emerging economies around the world,” said Enoh T. Ebong, USTDA’s Director. “This project will offer significant opportunities for U.S. companies to offer the kinds of highly innovative healthcare technologies that the center will require.”\n\nUSTDA’s study will provide AMATA the necessary data and analysis for the phased implementation of a new oncology center that will advance Thailand’s aspiration to be a medical hub in Southeast Asia. The center would be the first part of the broader “Meditown” hub project that AMATA is developing.\n\n“The strong support from USTDA is very timely, as this represents an important milestone toward developing Thailand’s medical and life sciences hub with our strategic partners, namely, the Thailand Center of Excellence for Life Science and Siriraj Hospital of Mahidol University. We look forward to working with world-class oncology center partners from the United States, as well,” said Vikrom Kromadit, Chairman of AMATA.\n\nAMATA Chief Investment Officer, Lena Ng, added: “The hub will provide world-class medical services through international collaboration with industry leaders across key areas such as pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, and research. The United States has excelled globally as a leader in healthcare and life sciences, especially in gene and cell therapy. This study will catalyze our collaboration with leading U.S. oncology service providers to enhance access to breakthrough treatments for cancer patients in Asia.”\n\nChargé d’Affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, Gwen Cardno, said: “As the pandemic has shown us, healthcare requires international cooperation at the highest levels, and that’s certainly applicable for cancer treatment. Through USTDA, the U.S. government is proud to work together with Thailand to promote innovative U.S. solutions for cancer treatment to strengthen its health system.”\n\nUSTDA’s assistance to AMATA advances one of the key pillars of the Biden-Harris Administration’s Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, which aims to strengthen global health security through investments in patient-centered health services. It also advances Thailand’s 4.0 scheme to revitalize the country’s eastern seaboard, including Rayong, Chonburi, and Chachoengsao provinces.\n\nU.S. businesses interested in submitting proposals for this feasibility study should visit www.ustda.gov/work/bid-on-an-overseas-project.",

    "Prayuth’s Misrule Is Turning Thailand Into a Powder Keg": "With Thailand’s national elections planned for early 2023, the mood among opposition members of parliament and activists—and even members of the pro-military coalition in power—is increasingly sour. Protests have been simmering over recent weeks in Bangkok, and this growing anger is setting the stage for political chaos in the coming months, and possibly a highly problematic election next year.\n\nThais are furious, in part because Prayuth Chan-ocha, the de facto head of the coalition government led by the pro-military Palang Pracharath party, insists he can continue as prime minister, despite a constitutional term limit of eight years. Prayuth has been prime minister since leading the 2014 coup that deposed the last fairly elected Thai government, but he claims his eight-year count should actually start in 2019, when he was elected prime minister in an election that was perhaps free but not fair. The Constitutional Court recently suspended Prayuth as prime minister until a final ruling decides his fate, though he remains defense minister.\n\nHowever, Gen. Prawit Wongsuwan—hated by Thai democracy activists for the critical role he played in the 2014 coup—took over as acting prime minister when Prayuth was suspended on Aug. 24. Prawit’s ascendance is hardly placating opposition forces or doing anything to woo the majority of Thais who will probably vote for an anti-military, pro-democracy party in next year’s elections. And with the courts in Thailand still incredibly loyal to the military and its allies, it’s certainly possible that a judge will rule that Prayuth’s clock should be reset to start 2019, allowing him to run for prime minister again next year.\n\nThe World This Week A weekly digest of the latest from CFR on the biggest foreign policy stories of the week, featuring briefs, opinions, and explainers.

Prayuth has proven to be a highly ineffective prime minister, even setting aside the term limit controversy. Following the coup and its harsh aftermath, in which pro-democracy protests were violently repressed, he never accepted any semblance of a return to parliamentary democracy—even after his coalition won the 2019 elections. He has also maintained his authoritarian tendencies. He has personally mocked and threatened the media and civil society, and his government has charged at least 200 activists and opposition politicians with various dubious crimes, including lese majeste.\n\nThis shift to increasingly enforcing the country’s draconian lese majeste laws, which make it illegal to defame or even insult the king and other royals, contrasts with the end of former King Bhumibhol Adulyadej’s rule in 2016, when it seemed like the use of these laws was on the decline. Bhumibhol himself—who was beloved in a way the current monarch, King Rama X, is not—had objected to the use of lese majeste at times, saying he was not above criticism. But since succeeding his father, Rama X has sought to expand the monarchy’s political and financial powers in ways that have alarmed many observers.\n\nIn addition, in 2020 the courts—which have historically been highly favorable to ruling pro-military parties—outlawed one of the main opposition parties, Future Forward, on a technicality, and the government has pursued what critics claim are politically motivated charges against some of Future Forward’s key leaders. As a result of Prayuth’s continued autocratic rule, as well as generally poor policy management, anger among the political opposition in Thailand is at a boil.\n\nThe opposition has tried to oust Prayuth with multiple no-confidence votes in parliament, though these have all failed. It has also held anti-government rallies in Bangkok and other cities across the country and launched anti-government campaigns on social media. Intriguingly, given the monarchy’s entrenched social, economic and political role in the country, political discussions on social media, and sometimes even at demonstrations, have in recent years turned to the monarchy’s impact on Thailand and whether its role should be more limited, given the extraordinary powers amassed by the largely disliked Rama X.\n\nThe opposition’s cause has been helped by the fact that, as prime minister, Prayuth has also been a policy disaster. After an initial—and perhaps lucky—year of battling COVID-19 in 2020, the government’s policies have been extremely flawed, in part because it allowed a company linked to the king to be involved in the initial manufacture and rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine. The economy remains weak—it grew slower than expected in the second quarter of this year—and inflation is badly hurting the Thai baht, a problem shared by many other emerging market currencies. The government has not developed a coherent plan for rebuilding tourism, which was one of the pillars of the Thai economy, in the aftermath of the pandemic. Nor does it have a strategy for keeping talented young Thais—who face a brutal job market, an autocratic environment, years of political conflict with seemingly no end in sight, and a king who is seemingly intent on reestablishing an absolute monarchy—from leaving the country.\n\nIn terms of foreign policy, under Prayuth’s leadership, Thailand’s usually skillful diplomats have struggled to come up with any coherent strategy for navigating the increasingly turbulent rivalry between the United States and China, or for dealing with the civil war and failed state in neighboring Myanmar. Even prominent members of Prayuth’s coalition have slammed his horrendous leadership, and Thailand’s regional power and influence has diminished greatly in recent years.\n\nMeanwhile, the opposition’s ability to mobilize mass support is growing, as demonstrated by the mass rallies it has held and effective social media strategies it has developed. In fact, they now have a real chance to win the elections next year, if the polls are free and fair.\n\nBut that’s something the opposition shouldn’t count on. The ruling pro-military coalition controls the administrative bodies that oversee the election and essentially controls the courts. Many major opposition leaders have already been banned from politics or forced into exile, with dubious charges of corruption and other crimes awaiting them if they return. As happened in 2019, even if the opposition does win a significant number of seats, the government will likely whittle it down by having compliant judges and the election commission overturn some on technicalities. And that’s assuming the election commission doesn’t meddle with the vote count to keep that from being necessary.\n\nIn an attempt to counter this possibility, on several occasions the opposition introduced amendments to disband the upper house of parliament, which was appointed by the junta prior to the 2019 elections and has powers to intervene in the election, and replace it with a more democratic body. These efforts were all defeated, so any controversy over the 2023 election will end up before the Senate, as well as a high court that is sure to favor the pro-military coalition.\n\nThe most likely scenario for next year’s election, then, is one in which the majority of Thais cast their votes for opposition or pro-democracy parties, only to see the Palang Pracharath and its allies, perhaps led by Prayuth, hold onto power through shady maneuvers, both political and judicial.\n\nAfter so many years of frustration across the country, such an outcome could easily ignite the powder keg that currently characterizes Thai politics, not unlike the massive Bangkok protests of 1992, in which the army fired on and killed large numbers of civilians, or the street battles and army massacres of 2010. One can hope for an alternative, but given Thailand’s history, a grim scenario seems more likely.",
    "A Fresh Start: Myanmar Refugees Find a New Home after Decades in Thailand - Thailand": "Mae Sot, 26 September 2022 – Life in Thailand is all Ah May has known.\n\nA native of the Karen ethnic group in Myanmar, 22-year-old Ah had never set foot in his home country. His mother left for Thailand when she was 19 and had him at a young age.\n\nSince the age of six, Ah has been living in the Umpiem Mai temporary shelter – 12 kilometres from the Myanmar border, in Thailand’s Tak Province. An estimated 10,600* individuals reside in the shelter, predominantly people of Karen ethnicity who fled conflict decades ago.\n\n“Life has been difficult. I never had opportunities, no hope, no identity,” he says about living in limbo. “I receive an allowance of around THB 250 (approximately USD 7)** per month, but it’s not enough with prices of goods increasing. Sometimes, we don’t have enough food.”\n\nLife for Ah is about to change drastically, as he prepares to board a plane for the first time to start afresh in the United States.\n\nAh is one of over 145,000 refugees that the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Thailand has assisted since 2004 to resettle to third countries – predominantly the United States, Australia and Canada, but to many others as well.\n\nIOM has been working closely with the Royal Thai Government and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) since 1975, when it began assisting nearly half a million Indochinese refugees to start new lives abroad.\n\nRoughly 91,000* remain in nine temporary shelters along the Thai-Myanmar border, most of whom have been residing in the shelters for decades, and 84 per cent of whom are Karen.\n\n“Thanks to the generosity and commitment of receiving countries, resettlement is an important process to support people fleeing persecution,” remarks Francesco Supit, IOM’s Head of Sub-Office in Mae Sot, where a majority of resettlement operations in Thailand is managed.\n\nIn recent years, IOM’s work in Thailand has been focused on facilitating the resettlement of refugees who have lived in temporary shelters for prolonged durations. Many had been accepted by UNHCR up to five years ago.\n\nIn 2021, IOM supported the resettlement of 901 refugees from Thailand – the lowest figure since 2006. “We must remember that resettlement is not a sustainable solution for everyone. There needs to be an enabling environment for many other refugees to return home safely when the time allows or for them to integrate locally,” added Supit.\n\nOnce individuals are accepted for resettlement, IOM receives notifications from receiving countries. Individuals undergo a comprehensive health assessment and pre-departure medical checks to ensure they are fit to travel.\n\n“The process includes complete medical examination and laboratory tests, according to technical instructions from the resettlement country. We provide vaccination, counselling and treatment for pre-departure stabilization, where needed,” explains Dr Poe Sandi Oo, IOM physician.\n\n“The environment and living conditions in the shelters can, unfortunately, lead to adverse health conditions, such as malnutrition, communicable and non-communicable diseases. We need to ensure that refugees can travel in good health.”\n\nOnce refugees are cleared for travel, IOM facilitates travel arrangements.\n\nA day before his flight to the United States, Ah sits next to Maung Maung and Mu Kyong Paw at the IOM premises in Mae Sot.\n\nBoth Maung and Mu fled Myanmar as children, although the exact ages escape them. Now in their mid-20s, they also do not recall where exactly in Myanmar they came from. They met at the Umpiem Mai shelter, got married and now have a seven-year-old child, who has also only ever known life in Thailand.\n\nAll four are partaking in a final pre-departure orientation, during which an experienced trainer takes them through aspects of the life-changing journey they are about to undertake. Since it will be the first time that most, if not all, have been on a plane, the lessons include basics like how to board a plane, fasten one’s seatbelt, use the lavatory, what to do during a layover, and more.\n\nSuch orientation is a critical component of preparing individuals for their new lives abroad – aimed at providing practical information about their new countries and empowering them with the skills and attitudes to succeed abroad.\n\nIn Thailand, IOM runs dedicated, multi-day training programmes for individuals resettling to Australia and Canada.\n\nAlthough the orientation goes a long way in alleviating some of his fears, Ah is not shy to express the challenges he foresees. “I have to learn a new language, get used to a new environment, understand a new transport system. It will take time to adjust.”\n\nAlthough Maung and Mu share the same reservations, they are grateful for the opportunities and choices their son will now have. Their reservations are eased, remembering that Mu’s parents had been resettled to the same town in the United States a year ago and will be at hand to help them settle into their new lives. “Her father works in a pork factory,” says Maung. “I hope I can find a job quickly too. I’ll be satisfied with any job.”\n\nUnfortunately, Maung’s parents remain in Umpiem – as does Ah’s mother. “It was very sad to say goodbye to my mother and friends,” expresses Ah, “but for now, I have to look forward to my future.”\n\nAh hopes to go back to school, earn a degree and find work. When asked what type of work he hopes to get into, he immediately quips: “I want to find a job where I can help others integrate smoothly when they arrive in the United States. I want to be there for others.”\n\nWhile some dread a long-haul flight halfway around the globe, for others, it signifies a lifeline – a path to new beginnings.\n\n*UNHCR* data as of August 2022*\n\n**Residents of the Umpiem Mai temporary shelter receive a monthly food stipend from The Border Consortium, ranging from THB 240 to THB 370 (USD 6 to 10) according to vulnerability criteria.\n\nThis story was written by Miko Alazas, IOM’s Media and Communications Officer in Thailand.",

A weaker currency keeps imports expensive and inflation elevated.\n\nWhile exports and tourism benefit from a weak local currency, sticky inflation erodes real incomes and exacerbates inequality and poverty, a major issue for the government ahead of scheduled general elections due by May.\n\nDespite those concerns, economists in the poll expected the BOT to continue on its hiking path well into next year with small increments of 25 bps, taking the rate to 2.00% by the end of 2023.\n\nHowever, forecasts for end-2023 ranged from 1.00% to 2.50%, suggesting uncertainty around policy direction.\n\n\"A diminishing stock of ammunition to protect their currencies will put Asian central banks under pressure to undertake a deeper tightening cycle, but this could come at the cost of slower growth,\" said Krystal Tan, economist at ANZ Bank.\n\n\"Notably, central banks in Indonesia and the Philippines hiked their policy rates by 50bp last week, and we expect their counterparts in Thailand...to follow suit,\" added Tan, who forecast a 50 basis-point hike at the September and November meetings.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nReporting by Anant Chandak; Polling by Arsh Mogre, Veronica Khongwir and Devayani Sathyan; Editing by Hari Kishan, Jonathan Cable, and Ana Nicolaci da Costa\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

    "Using Digital Democracy to Energize Thailand": "Thuntee Ruben Sukchotrat, Director of Digital Transformation for the Thai Sang Thai Party, is a digital democracy revolutionary. Sukchotrat sees the income inequality in his nation as a sign that his people have not had a proper voice in setting and implementing public policies. And he believes that building a technology-based future should begin in the nation’s schools.\n\nThe timing for such ‘art of the possible’ thinking is right – The Thai Constitutional Court is debating term limits for its leadership, one that has arguably lost the trust of its citizenry; the Thai economy is in poor shape; and the once disillusioned are slowly sowing the seeds of forming a movement of tangible change.\n\nThe heavy military influence in Thai politics, made semiofficial under the current constitution, is becoming increasingly unpopular with the more liberal, progressive younger generation – a voting bloc courted by the Thai Sang Thai party. But a challenge lies in that younger Thais can be slower to adapt to such seismic societal change envisioned.\n\nSukchotrat however wants to provide citizens with digital tools to gain direct access to government services and what is more, to provide input on government policy. Government bureaucrats, he says, often obfuscate rather than speak plainly to citizens.\n\nHe joined the fledgling political party at its outset to better position himself to promote this vision.\n\nBy accessing the metaverse citizens, Sukchotrat says, ordinary citizens can become more active participants in their governance and ensure that governments both in Thailand and worldwide can better serve their employers (the citizenry). Just as importantly, citizens who believe that their views can impact public policy and performance are incentivized to better inform themselves about public affairs.\n\nIt’s a win-win.\n\n“Having been a fan of ‘efficiency’ since childhood,” he adds, “we have been thinking of ways to reach our goals as quickly as possible, with as few resources as possible, based on the right rules.” Digitalization is the future, he contends, and failure to modernize access to forms, applications, and other ways that people communicate with government wastes time and resources and costs the nation and its people financially.\n\nBut, he cautions, most of the 80 percent of Thais who own smartphones do not yet know how to use them strategically to get ahead in their daily lives and businesses – or to solve their government-related issues. Sukchotrat has been touting a long-term plan to provide that knowledge, political literacy and empowerment if you will, to Thai citizens.\n\nIn his view, the nationwide effort to increase the level of such literacy should begin with teaching young students the principles of using, understanding, and creating technical fluency needed to engage with computers and the Internet. A second step is to create specially designed programs to enable adults to build skills and gain the necessary knowledge to enhance their horizons in the job market.\n\nSukchotrat knows the value of digital literacy from his own experience. After graduating from a Thai university, he spent several years in Texas, earning a Ph.D. in data mining from the University of Texas at Arlington. After working as a researcher for Expedia.com, Sukchotrat returned to Thailand armed with finely honed data mining skills.\n\nBack home, Sukchotrat got a government job helping citizens with tax planning and solutions for tax filing. Then, he began to formulate ideas for using technology to make his government more efficient and less corrupt. Upon leaving government service, he became CEO of Legal Drive Co., Ltd., the owner of iTAX, the leading personal income tax solutions provider in Thailand.\n\nWhen he saw how poorly the Thai government was managing its response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Sukchotrat decided to embark on a political career. He lamented delays in vaccinations and vaccines, businesses shutting down due to lack of communications and government support and frankly, watching friends and family dying – “I could not any longer just sit back and watch.”\n\nThe newly formed Thai Sang Thai Party attracted his attention, and party leaders were receptive and quick to put his digital skills to work. His interests in revitalizing the nation by marshalling the skills of the emergent generation aligned with those of both party founder and leader Khunying Sudarat Keyuraphan (formerly the Pheu Thai party’s chief strategist) and Policy Center Director Tidarat Yingcharoen (Tida).\n\nTida says her new party hopes to recruit older Thais as “foundations” to enable the youthful party leaders to bring in a diversity of ideas to better serve the people’s needs and viewpoints. Most bureaucracies (in and out of government) are so hierarchical that they stifle new ideas and the energetic young leaders that could help them reach their full potential.\n\nTida conversely notes that the party, while led by a former prime minister candidate of the nation’s largest political sect, is staffed by a coterie of young, dynamic, collaborative activists with a zeal for equitable treatment for all Thai citizens.\n\nThe ongoing suppression of political parties in Thailand should not stymie Thai Sang Thai, she says.\n\nOne of Sukchotrat’s new initiatives is to unionize the nation’s gig economy workers. He unveiled such a strategy at the Thailand Metaverse Expo 2022 in Bangkok in August. Such innovative thinking is direly needed – Thailand’s GDP growth is now the lowest in the ASEAN, the nation is lacking in investment and cannot compete with nearby countries in exports. And as Thai society ages, there is a growing labor shortage that has impacted small organizations and independent (gig) workers the hardest.\n\nThrough a labor union, Sukchotrat believes, gig workers can raise their incomes, reduce costs, and better utilize technology and innovation to build personal stability. A union structure would enable gig workers to get affordable health insurance, have better access to legal and other services, and protect their independent status and flexibility.\n\nUnion backing could also help them obtain loans and other banking services more readily and at better rates. And the union could offer training for members to improve their job skills and enable younger workers to move up into better jobs over time.\n\nThe gig worker union initiative also dovetails with Thai Sang Thai’s overarching vision for liberating and empowering “small people” who are the foundation of the Thai economy – Yet another example of Sukchotrat’s next-generation vision of rebuilding (and retooling) the nation from the bottom up.\n\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the authors alone and do not necessarily reflect those of Geopoliticalmonitor.com",
    "On the Thai Island of Koh Tao, Can Tourism and the Environment Coexist?": "Mr. Hagen, from Denmark, and his American wife, Rachel Yaseen, took over Evasion, an outdoor sports company, in May after bicycling around the world for three and a half years, and wanting a place to rest. She opened Untamed yoga studio a couple doors down, and they bought three sea-view villas in the hills on the south side of the island to rent out during the high seasons.\n\n“It’s hard to say what’s not to like — there’s a huge variety of good restaurants and it’s affordable; the diving here is so super-easy and chill, and from the villa we can sit in the pool and see the turtles and the sharks,” Mr. Hagen said. “And the hiking here is definitely challenging, because of the steep hills.”\n\nEvasion also offers tubing and wakeboarding, and he’s turning their boat into a solar-powered craft so it gives tourists a quiet ride and doesn’t harm the coral. He also has on order eight electric bicycles, and is in the process of getting their villas powered by solar panels and looking into renting electric motorbikes.\n\nEcoTao, which opened on a steep, forested hill just months before the pandemic cut off tourism in March 2020, is perhaps the island’s only actual eco accommodation, where the 12 bungalows are made of bamboo and teak, most of the power comes from 100 solar panels, and rainwater is collected for showers.\n\nFounder Yves Frangioni, a French entrepreneur and sportsman who moved to the island 16 years ago, believes the eco trend might be starting to catch on with tourists and businesses.\n\n“We opened in December and we are busy always,” he said in a phone interview on his way to France for a couple of months. “I hope that many start like me, because it’s important for the small island, the planet, everything.”\n\nFollow New York Times Travel on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

    "Thailand roadside bomb kills police officer, injures three others": "Southern Thailand has been the site of a low-level rebellion by Muslim fighters which has resulted in thousands killed.\n\nA Thai policeman was killed, and four others injured when a roadside bomb detonated as their vehicles passed near a hospital in southern Thailand, police said.\n\nA police motorcycle and a patrol truck were travelling together when both were hit by the blast in front of a hospital in Mai Kaen town, Pattani province, on Tuesday night, police captain Wasuwat Kongtuk said on Wednesday.\n\nThe explosion killed an officer on a motorcycle and caused the police truck to veer off the road before crashing into an electrical pole. Three officers in the truck were rushed to the hospital for treatment.\n\nPolice believe the bomb was planted in a rubbish bin in front of the hospital and that it was detonated remotely.\n\nTV footage on Wednesday showed damage to the Mai Kaen hospital exterior and a shrapnel hole in the Mai Kaen Kittiwit school, which was located opposite the hospital. The school was ordered to close for the day.\n\nExplosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) officers sealed off the area and combed nearby streets for evidence.\n\nSouthern Thailand is in the grip of a low-level rebellion led by Muslim fighters, who have long complained of discrimination by the country’s Buddhist majority.\n\nThe rebels are mostly active in Thailand’s three southernmost provinces of Pattani, Narathiwat and Yala and often attack government targets. The southern region bordering Malaysia is heavily policed by Thai security forces and is also culturally distinct having been colonised by Thailand just over a century ago.\n\nLast month, a wave of at least 17 coordinated arson attacks and explosions targeted convenience stores at petrol stations in the provinces of Pattani, Yala and Narathiwat leaving seven people suffering minor injuries.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had brought a lull in southern clashes between rebels and the military, but a six-day gun battle in October last year killed six people.\n\nMore than 7,300 people have been killed in Thailand’s southern conflict since 2004, according to the Deep South Watch group, which monitors the violence in southern Thailand.",
    "Far from home, alone: Cambodian students share life in Thailand during the pandemic lockdown": "This article by Seoung Nimol was originally published by Prachatai, an independent news site in Thailand, and an edited version is republished by Global Voices under a content-sharing agreement.\n\nLiving far away from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, Cambodian students who came to Thailand to pursue their studies experienced problems stemming from lockdown, lonesomeness, and a sense of loss.\n\nLiving in dormitories without face-to-face engagement and social communication, they felt scared, lonely, and bored under stressful lockdown restrictions. Individuals experienced psychological symptoms.\n\nAccording to a UNICEF-led study in 2020, 7 out of 10 children and young people worldwide reported that COVID-19 had a negative impact on their mental health. The majority were worried about family household incomes, their studies, and their future education, and employment opportunities.\n\nThai universities were ordered to close in March 2020, as the number of COVID-19 cases rose dramatically. It was not until 2022 that universities started to resume on-site teaching.\n\nPich Somaly, a fourth-year agricultural technology major at Burapha University, said once the closure was announced, the silent atmosphere left by Thai students who had returned home was fearsome. That was not an option for her and four other Cambodian students as the borders were closed.\n\nAll of the Thai students had already gone back home. Only a few Cambodian students remained, and it was very quiet in our building. We were scared and worried about getting this disease since we came to study far away from home. These feelings made us think too much and caused stress.\n\nLife was completely changed. She claimed that she always had to consider things carefully before acting, but this was accompanied by emotional distress and worry. She was always so nervous when she went to get food.\n\nIt was hugely challenging to buy food. I was very vulnerable to infection if I went to the market. I stayed in the room for 14 days for quarantine. I was afraid of getting infected because I had not been vaccinated. I was shocked because it is not our home.\n\nMental health issues may also arise from the disease itself, such as grief from loss of life.\n\nMost first-year students believed they would experience a new environment by learning and communicating with people in Thailand.\n\nInstead, they faced a bitter and challenging time adapting to the global crisis. They began their studies with worry, no social interaction and anxiety about the deteriorating COVID-19 situation, which had a significant negative impact on their mental health.\n\nSeun Ung Mengchou, now president of the Khmer Students Association at Thammasat University, said she was still a freshman in 2020 who had just received a scholarship to study in Thailand from her university. At that time, the COVID-19 situation was terrible in Thailand.\n\nHer first experience of living abroad was disrupted by the pandemic and it proved to be very challenging for Mengchou. She claimed that while struggling to stay in their rooms, every Cambodian student felt fear and loneliness, while Thai students could go home to their families.\n\nOur mental health has also been seriously affected by the Covid-19 crisis. We didn't have relatives here, and we were anxious about what to do if we became infected. We have been far away from home. Many patients had to stay outside the hospital due to the situation at that time. That was incomprehensible. We felt lonely; we were homesick. We were troubled about our studies and the infection situation.\n\nMost students were forced to sit in their rooms and study online, which was not a good study environment. Students were becoming more stressed, which could reduce productivity at work and poor academic performance.\n\nOnline learning\n\nAll students had to switch to online learning in order to assure their safety. Their learning was impacted since they were unable to adapt quickly to the unexpected changes.\n\nSomaly said that her major was in science and all on-site laboratory sessions were postponed. It was tedious and exhausting for her to spend three hours studying in front of a computer.\n\nBecause we could focus only on the first session, learning online was difficult to follow. We found the virtual classroom to be boring. Only 30 to 40% of what I learned online was truly effective, in my opinion. I only had lessons without a lab that I did not fully understand.\n\nHowever, lab sessions were resumed when the universities reopened at the end of 2021, so it was not a big concern for her major, she said.\n\nAccording to Meng Chou, active participation and intense concentration are both necessary for online learning to be extremely effective. Students were unable to focus, however, because they continued to study in an uncomfortable environment.\n\nPhara Pich Pisey, a student at Thammasat University's Faculty of Architecture, started her first year of study online. Difficulties arose as her major required students to cooperate in group projects for a whole year. Discussions tended to be difficult as they could not convene face-to-face.\n\nShe continued by saying that working in teams and studying online was less effective, stressful, and greatly affected academic performance.\n\nWe had a number of projects to work on, and there was no exam. Our first-year study projects did not get good results because of the online group discussions. Some members did not help, and the quality of the work was not good. It was difficult to learn and discuss, compared to physical classes.\n\nFacilitating COVID-19 vaccination\n\nOn the upside, Cambodian students were facilitated by their universities to receive COVID-19 vaccines, like Thai students.\n\nSomaly and Mengchou said in 2021, they and their Cambodian friends studying in Thailand received assistance from their universities.\n\nSomaly's university also developed a mental health consultation and counselling service for students after observing mental health issues among students throughout the epidemic. After the COVID-19 situation in Thailand improved, and the lockdown measures ended, their lives improved. They were able to go out and interact socially.\n\nAs a result of their experiences, Cambodian students requested that the university set up a mental health team, an international student assistance team to communicate with, support and guide them in any emergency situations that arise in the future.",

(Photo: Shopee (Thailand)\n\nE-marketplace company Shopee is pursuing fresh job cuts in Thailand, albeit a low single-digit reduction of its headcount in the country, as part of its efforts to attain profitability and weather economic challenges.\n\nThe move was announced in a town hall meeting on Monday morning, according to a source at Shopee. The source did not give the exact figure of the headcount reduction.\n\nThe source described the approach as the ongoing business restructuring of the e-marketplace.\n\nOne of the key reasons for the layoffs is the current macroeconomic situation, while another is to pave the way for long-term profitability as Shopee pursues self-sufficiency, the source said.\n\nShopee is the e-commerce business arm of Singapore-headquartered internet giant Sea, which is part-owned by Chinese internet firm Tencent Holdings.\n\nShopee is one of Sea’s two major businesses. Another is the Garena gaming unit.\n\nGarena earlier cut jobs in Southeast Asia, including Thailand, due to poor performance in the gaming business.\n\nIn June, Sea laid off 300 employees working for Shopee, online payment service ShopeePay and food delivery arm ShopeeFood in Thailand.\n\nShopee Thailand posted 13.3 billion baht in revenue in 2021, up 129% year-on-year, but saw massive losses of 4.9 billion, worsening by 19.24% year-on-year, according to Creden Data, a data analytics service provider.\n\nAccording to the Businessinsider news website, Forrest Li, founder, chairman and chief executive of Shopee, issued a memo to Shopee employees that outlined cost-cutting measures.\n\n\"Our number one objective for the next 12-18 months is achieving self-sufficiency,\" Li wrote in the memo.\n\nThe company will be restricting employee expenses, capping all flights at the economy level, and executives will temporarily forgo compensation, the memo read.\n\nPawoot Pongvitayapanu, an e-commerce pundit, said Shopee is concentrating more on profitability as investors are concerned about rising inflation and the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nWith limited financial injections, Shopee cannot aggressively expand its business, he said.\n\nShopee has closed its operations in various countries amid the global economic challenges.\n\nThe E-marketplace market in Thailand is now unlikely to see the kind of cutthroat promotional and discount campaigns that were vigorously pursued in the past, he said.\n\nShopee’s rival Lazada has also focused on profit-making, with better operating results in the past two years, said Mr Pawoot.",

    "Thailand: Mock fashion show protester sentenced to two years for ‘insulting the monarchy’": "Responding to the conviction and sentencing to two years’ imprisonment of protester Jatuphon “Niw” Saeung for participating in a mock fashion show in Thailand in October 2020, Amnesty International’s Deputy Secretary General Kyle Ward said:\n\n“The mock fashion show was a satirical take on the political situation of the country – a peaceful public event akin to a street festival with music, food and dancing. Participants should not be punished for participating in a peaceful assembly.\n\n“This sentence, which is at least the 10th conviction for lèse-majesté – or insulting the monarchy – handed down since 2021, is a chilling prelude of what’s to come: a record number of 210 activists and protesters have been charged under Article 112 of Thailand’s Criminal Code since the beginning of overwhelmingly peaceful mass protests in 2020.\n\n“We urge the authorities to immediately drop all charges against those who have merely exercised their human rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, and release those arbitrarily detained.\n\n“With protests picking up again in Thailand, this latest conviction underlines the degree to which Thai authorities continue to repress peaceful dissent.\n\n“Thai authorities are obliged to protect the peaceful exercise of the rights to expression and assembly, but they instead continue to pursue criminal proceedings against demonstrators, many of them young people or even children. These young protesters should be free to express their opinions and participate in discussions in society, and should not face the prospect of unwarranted prison sentences and criminal records.”\n\nBackground\n\nThe Bangkok Criminal Court in Thailand initially sentenced a protester Jatuphon “Niw” Saeung to three years in prison on 12 September 2022 after authorities charged her with insulting the monarchy under Article 112 of the Criminal Code. Under this law, anyone convicted of defaming, insulting or threatening the king, queen, heir-apparent or regent may be given a jail term from three to 15 years. The Court reduced her sentence by one-third to two years in prison due to her provision of information to the authorities. In the same case, Niw was also convicted of violating the Public Assembly Act and subjected to a fine of 1,500 THB. The Court later reduced the fine to 1,000 THB. Niw is currently detained at the Central Women’s Correctional Institution in Bangkok while awaiting the Court of Appeal’s decision on her bail request.\n\nUnited Nations human rights experts have repeatedly expressed their concern at the rise in the use of the provision, and how it casts a chilling effect on the peaceful exercise of freedom of expression and assembly. UN experts and other member states have further repeatedly called on the authorities to repeal Article 112 or amend it so that it would be consistent with Thailand’s international human rights obligations.\n\nNiw took part in a satirical fashion show on Silom Road in Bangkok on 29 October 2020. She was accused of imitating and mocking the Thai Queen by wearing a traditional Thai dress.\n\nThe October 2020 demonstration was one of dozens in 2020 and early 2021, when tens and possibly hundreds of thousands predominantly peaceful and young demonstrators, including children, took to the streets to demand political, economic and social reforms in Thailand. Authorities have filed criminal proceedings against more than 1,800 activists, including over 280 children, for participating in protests and expressing their opinions.\n\nSince November 2020, at least 210 people, including 17 children, have been accused of committing lèse majesté, according to Thai Lawyers for Human Rights, with ten convictions handed down from 2021 to 2022, the group said.\n\nAmnesty International does not comment on the nature of speeches deemed in breach of the provision, but urges the authorities to uphold its duty under international law to respect, protect and promote the peaceful exercise of freedom of expression.\n\nThailand is a state party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which protects the right to freedom of expression under its Article 19 and to peaceful assembly under its Article 21. The UN Human Rights Committee, the treaty body responsible for monitoring the implementation of the ICCPR, has expressed concerns regarding lèse majesté laws. It stated that all public figures, including those exercising the highest political authority, are legitimately subject to criticism and political opposition and that criticism of state institutions should not be prohibited. Even if the alleged violation of lèse majesté is seen as a defamation-related offence, the Committee has further stated that “imprisonment is never an appropriate penalty”.\n\nOther UN member states have continuously made recommendations to abolish the lèse majesté provision in the Criminal Code, for example at the UN Human Rights Council’s Universal Periodic Review of Thailand. The Thai government has to date always rejected these recommendations.",
    "Thailand pet food market details growing exports": "BANGKOK — With United States pet food manufacturers known globally for superior products, it’s no wonder that exports of these products have grown significantly during the past few years, according to Gina Tumbarello, senior director of international policy and trade for the American Feed Industry Association (AFIA). In Pet Food Processing’s September 2022 edition, Tumbarello detailed the trade opportunities US pet food processors are missing out on within various global regions, including Thailand.\n\n“While Vietnam and Thailand are not currently significant markets for pet food exports, there is growing potential for US pet food manufacturers to compete in these markets,” Tumbarello wrote. “…In Thailand [households owning cats and dogs] grew 22% and 17% respectively, between 2017 and 2021.”\n\nAccording to the US Census Bureau, US exports of dog and cat food to Thailand grew a mere 4.2% from 2021 to 2022, amassing $8.98 million. Though there is trade potential for US pet food processors in the country, most pet food exports are hindered by Thai tariff rates, which currently sit at 9%.\n\nAs pet ownership in the Indo-Pacific country increases, as well as trends in premiumization and humanization, Thai exports are gaining significant traction as US exports fall behind in the country.\n\nAccording to the Thai Pet Food Trade Association (TPFA), Thailand became the world’s third largest pet food exporter in 2021, exporting a value of more than 65 billion baht ($1.7 billion USD), a 27% increase from 2020. The country’s top exporters include the United States, Japan, Italy, Malaysia and Australia. According to the association, Thai pet food exports have already witnessed significant growth for 2022, increasing 43% within the first seven months.\n\nWith a large agricultural industry, 95% of the raw materials used in Thai pet foods are sourced locally, furthering the country’s production and success in global trade, according to TPFA.\n\n\"Our strengths also derive from the long-standing experiences and reputation in canned tuna production which can be broaden into wet pet food manufacturing,\" said Chanintr Chalisarapong, Ph.D., president of TPFA.\n\nThe country’s top pet food manufacturers include Perfect Companion Group, owner of SmartHeart and Me-O brands; Asian Sea, owner of the Monchou brand; Charoen Pokphand Foods, owner of JerHigh and Jinny brands; and Thai Union, owner of the brand ChangeTer. The growth of pet ownership and consumer demand for more pet nutrition products within the country has also attracted several international companies, including Mars Petcare, Nestle Purina, Pedigree and Tiki Pets.\n\nIn Thailand, pet food consumers are interested in pet food products that boast safety, variety and dietary value, similar to those of human foods. Consumer demand has increased for prescription formulas and functional supplements that target a variety of pet health conditions, like heart, lung and kidney diseases, according to TPFA.\n\n\"The trust in our manufacturers' quality and safety standards from customers, combined with product diversification, innovation and continuous development contribute to Thailand's competitive edge in the global pet food market,\" Chalisarapong said.\n\nWith the global pet food market projected to reach a CAGR of 4.6% from 2022 to 2027, according to Mordor Intelligence, Thailand will likely ramp up its competitiveness in the global market and further its position as a leader in pet food exportation.\n\nFind more articles related to pet food export opportunities and trade.",

Oliang (Thai iced coffee)\n\nOliang or Thai iced coffee is similar to Americano but different. Hence, the commonly-used phrase of “same same, but different.” The coffee is mixed with other ingredients that include roasted rice, caramel, and roasted coffee beans. People normally enjoy Oliang cold or iced, however, if you can drink it hot as well. Moreover, if you add milk to Oliang, you can turn it into another local drink called Cafe Boran. The name Cafe Boran translates in English to ancient coffee. This spin-off is quite popular to have at breakfast time, along with porridge and Patongo.\n\n3. Nom Yen (Thai pink milk)\n\nThis eclectic twist on traditional hot milk is absolutely delicious. Furthermore, Thais have figured out how to make this milk more colourful and sweet. With a pink tint, this milk is made with green or red syrup and is popular with younger generations. Moreover, as it has no caffeine, the sweetness serves as a substitute for such caffeinated drinks. To sip this drink like a local, you can pair it with some steamed bread and sweet custard dipping sauce or coconut jam.\n\n4. Chao Kuai ( Grass jelly)\n\nChao Kuai, or grass jelly, can actually be added to many things, such as coconut ice cream for dessert. However, adding it to your choice of drink is possibly the best way to enjoy it. You can find numerous drinks in Thailand with grass jelly inside it, from teas to juices. However, our favourite has to be grass jelly mixed served with crushed ice and water, then sprinkled with brown sugar.\n\n5. Nam Lum Yai (Longan juice)\n\nIn Thailand, longan juice is known as NamLumYai. This juice is light and refreshing. Longan is a seasonal fruit, so the juice isn’t always available on the street all year. However, 7/11 sells a non-fresh version. It is widely recommended to serve the drink over ice for a refreshing drink that contains bits of the actual fruit.\n\nThailand’s local drinks are known the world over for their interesting twists on conventional recipes. From longan juice to pink milk with syrup drinks, trying Thai recipes is a great way to cool off in the hot weather. Moreover, they can be found almost anywhere and for a seriously cheap price!",
    "Sacred Heart of Jesus sisters feed Thailand's largest slum for a token fee": "A group of Catholic nuns in Thailand have launched a feeding program in the country's largest slum in the capital Bangkok to assist hundreds of poor people for a token fee.\n\nThe nuns from the Congregation of the Sacred Heart of Jesus began the \"One Hand Meal for One Baht\" project in the slum in Bangkok's Khlong Toei district, Radio Veritas Asia reported on Sept. 21.\n\nSacred Heart Sister Orapin said the initiative was in response to Pope Francis' call to reach out to the poor on the borders of society.\n\n\"It implores us to take action for them. We do not have to go too far to meet the poor because our school is only a few blocks away from the biggest slum area in Bangkok,\" said Sister Orapin.\n\nThe nuns provide the food monthly to around 200 people in the slum area for only one Thai Baht (US $0.027) per meal making it virtually free for residents.\n\nSister Orapin said the fee per meal collected was \"a symbolic participation fee\" to make people feel that they are part of a project and not \"passive recipients of charity.\"\n\nDubbed the \"dialogue of life,\" the project aims to help the poor, understand their problems, and open a channel for interreligious dialogue among the people.\n\nThe Congregation of the Sacred Heart of Jesus nuns — based in Bangkok — is well known in Thailand for running some of the largest and best-rated schools in the country.",

    "Photos: Thailand’s out-of-work elephants in crisis": "In Thailand’s northeastern village of Ban Ta Klang, Siriporn Sapmak starts her day by doing a livestream of her two elephants on social media. She does this to raise money to survive.\n\nThe 23-year-old, who has been taking care of elephants since she was in school, points her phone at the animals as she feeds them bananas and they walk around behind her family home.\n\nSiriporn says she can raise about 1,000 baht ($27.46) in donations from several hours of livestreaming on TikTok and YouTube, but that is only enough to feed her two elephants for one day.\n\nIt is a new, and insecure, source of income for the family, who before the pandemic earned money by doing elephant shows in the Thai city of Pattaya. They top up their earnings by selling fruit.\n\nLike thousands of other elephant owners around the country, the Sapmak family had to return to their home village as the pandemic decimated elephant camps and foreign tourism ground to a halt. Only 400,000 foreign tourists arrived in Thailand last year compared with nearly 40 million in 2019.\n\nSome days, Siriporn doesn’t receive any donations and her elephants are underfed.\n\n“We are hoping for tourists to [return]. If they come back, we might not be doing these livestreams any more,” she said. “If we get to go back to work, we get an [stable] income to buy grass for elephants to eat.”\n\nEdwin Wiek, founder of Wildlife Friends Foundation Thailand, estimates that at least 1,000 elephants in Thailand would have no “proper income” until more tourists return.\n\nThailand has about 3,200 to 4,000 captive elephants, according to official agencies, and about 3,500 in the wild.\n\nWiek said the Livestock Development Department needs to find “some kind” of budget to support these elephants.\n\n“Otherwise, it’s going to be difficult to keep them alive I think, for most families,” he said.\n\nThe families in Ban Ta Klang, the epicentre of Thailand’s elephant business located in Surin province, have cared for elephants for generations and have a close connection to them.\n\nElephant shows and rides have long been popular with tourists, especially the Chinese, while animal rights groups’ criticism of how elephants are handled there has given rise to tourism in sanctuaries.\n\n“We are bound together like family members,” Siriporn’s mother Pensri Sapmak, 60, said.\n\n“Without the elephants, we don’t know what our future will look like. We have today thanks to them.”\n\nThe government has sent 500 tonnes of grass across multiple provinces since 2020 to help feed the elephants, according to the Livestock Development Department, which oversees captive elephants.\n\nElephants, Thailand’s national animal, eat 150 to 200kg (330 to 440 pounds) each day, according to the Wildlife Conservation Society.\n\nSiriporn and her mother, however, said they have not yet received any government support.\n\n“This is a big national issue,” said Livestock Development Department Director-General Sorawit Thanito.\n\nHe said the government plans to assist elephants and their caretakers and that “measures along with a budget will be proposed to cabinet” without giving a time frame.\n\nWhile the government is expecting 10 million foreign tourists this year, some say this may not be enough to lure elephant owners back to top tourist destinations, given the costs involved. Chinese tourists, the mainstay of elephant shows, have also yet to return amid COVID-19 lockdowns at home.\n\n“Who has the money right now to arrange a truck … and how much security [do] they have that they are really going to have business again when they go back?” asks Wiek.\n\nHe expected more elephants to be born in captivity over the next year, exacerbating the pressures on their owners.\n\n“Some days we make some money, some days none, meaning there’s going to be less food on the table”,” said Pensri. “I don’t see a light at the end of the tunnel.”",

    "MEA asks Indians to exercise caution before taking up jobs in Thailand": "ET Online\n\nET Online\n\nIndia on Thursday asked Indian nationals to exercise extreme caution before taking up jobs in Thailand after dozens of Indians were illegally brought into Myanmar as part of the employment racket.Speaking at a weekly press briefing, Ministry of External Affairs ( MEA ) spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said IT companies are engaged in digital scamming and forged crypto activities. He said that these scammers are recruiting Indian workers on the pretext of employment opportunities in Thailand.\"We are aware of fraudulent IT companies that appear to be engaged in digital scamming and forged crypto activities. They seem to be operating with agents from Dubai, Bangkok and India. They are recruiting Indian workers on the pretext of employment opportunities in Thailand,\" the MEA spokesperson said.He explained that Indian workers are lured by social media advertisements of highly lucrative jobs and then taken across the border in Myawaddy.\"And that area you know is difficult to access due to the local security situation. Nevertheless, thanks to our mission in the country, we have been able to facilitate the rescue of some of these victims from captivity or forced labour and we are trying to help others,\" he said.Bagchi urged Indian nationals to exercise extreme caution before accepting such job offers. \"It may also be mentioned here that the visa-on-arrival scheme in Thailand does not permit employment. Our embassies in Thailand and Myanmar have issued advisories in this regard. We have also taken up the matter both with Thailand and Myanmar,\" he said.On a question about the specific number of Indian caught in Myanmar, the MEA spokesperson said, \"This is difficult to say. 32 people have certainly been rescued and helped out of the place. I don't have an exact number. Maybe 80 to 90 people are there.\"Earlier, the Indian Embassy in Myanmar's Yangon released an advisory. It had cautioned about the companies engaged in digital scamming activities located in remote eastern border areas of Myanmar.\"The Mission has observed in the recent past that some lT companies engaged in digital scamming/forge crypto activities located in remote eastern border areas of Myanmar are recruiting Indian workers from different places through their recruiting agents on the pretext of potential employment opportunities in IT sector,\" the advisory said.The advisory said the Indian workers were being facilitated to enter Myanmar illegally without proper documentation leading to the entrapment of Indian workers.\"In view of the above, Indian nationals are hereby requested to exercise due caution and verify the antecedents of the recruiting agents.

    "Why was Thailand’s cannabis bill voted down and will this derail legalization?": "Why was Thailand’s cannabis bill voted down and will this derail legalization?\n\nThe shooting down of the marijuana bill in Parliament last week sparked concerns on both sides of the debate.\n\nThe pro-pot camp is worried the legalization of cannabis will be reversed, while others – including many doctors – are afraid that consumption of cannabis without proper controls will continue.\n\nWill marijuana become illegal again?\n\nMPs from two major parties – the Democrats and Pheu Thai – have called for a review of the draft law’s content, but they have also suggested that it may be time to reconsider whether cannabis should be removed from the list of illegal narcotics.\n\nChaithawat Tulathon, secretary-general of the opposition Move Forward Party, called on Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul to cancel the decriminalization of cannabis until the Marijuana Act is implemented.\n\nAnutin is also leader of the coalition’s Bhumjaithai Party, whose key election promise was to legalize marijuana.\n\nAs such, Bhumjaithai insists it will do everything to ensure the recent legalization is not reversed.\n\nThe party’s pro-marijuana stance has won the support of many groups in Thailand. These include the People’s Cannabis Network, which described the House of Representatives’ rejection of the bill during its second reading as a “big disappointment”.\n\n“MPs should realize that there are people in their areas who require cannabis for health reasons,” the network’s key man Thanachoke Tienrungroj said.\n\nWhy was the bill shot down?\n\nPrasert Chanruangthong, Pheu Thai Party’s secretary-general, said the bill had only 46 articles in the first reading, but that suddenly grew to twice as many in the second reading.\n\n“I have to say the addition of more than 40 new articles is unprecedented,” Prasert commented. “We have to exercise caution. We have no objection to marijuana being used for medical reasons but we are worried about recreational use.”\n\nDemocrat MP Satit Wongnongtoey said the marijuana bill was problematic because it does not ease the worries of doctors and families over marijuana’s negative effects.\n\nPheu Thai, which leads the opposition, and government coalition partner the Democrat Party deny their opposition to the bill is part of a political game.\n\nHowever, the Democrats are reportedly upset that Bhumjaithai had earlier opposed their decision to keep collecting interest on student loans.\n\nWhat was added to the bill?\n\nSuphachai Jaismut, Bhumjaithai Party’s registrar, argued that the extra articles added to the bill were necessary to strengthen rules on consuming cannabis. For instance, one new article bans people under the age of 20 from using cannabis in any form.\n\nPheu Thai’s deputy leader Suthin Klangsaeng, however, complained that several changes were questionable. He cited the change in the maximum number of cannabis plants each household could grow, from six in the first reading of the bill to 15 in the second reading.\n\nWhat do doctors say?\n\nMore than 1,000 doctors have signed a petition calling on authorities to urgently plug the legal loopholes opened after cannabis was taken off the narcotics list. Since there is no single comprehensive law governing its use, consumption of cannabis is now unregulated in many aspects.\n\n“Thailand has been very liberal in terms of cannabis usage for more than three months now. Without clear and proper regulations, recreational marijuana has spread through different communities and reached children as well as vulnerable people,” the petition said.\n\n“Don’t wait for the bill to be legislated. The longer this legal vacuum exists, the more the country will be damaged.”\n\nEarlier this month, the Medical Association of Thailand, the Medical Council and several specialist colleges released a statement voicing their concerns. The statement also claimed that the policy of treating marijuana as a non-narcotic substance and allowing people to grow and use the herb to treat health conditions would do more harm than good.\n\n“Consuming marijuana can be addictive and can have long-term health impacts, including mental illness,” it said. “Homegrown marijuana can be contaminated and people lack sufficient medical knowledge to administer it properly,” the statement added.\n\nThe draft bill has been withdrawn and sent for further review before it can be tabled for debate again in Parliament. However, the House of Representatives’ current term ends in March next year, meaning the bill may not be passed during this Parliament.\n\nAnutin said Bhumjaithai would continue to push for the bill during the next election if it fails to pass under this Parliament",
    "EU and Thailand cap turbulent decade with a partnership agreement": "The EU has finally sealed a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) with Thailand, its sixth with a Southeast Asian country, as both sides seek to repair relations that frayed following a military coup in Bangkok eight years ago.\n\nIt may provide the needed momentum to relaunch talks over a full free trade agreement.\n\nThe PCA, which is still awaiting a formal signing, improves bilateral ties on a range of issues, from human rights to counterterrorism. Brussels sees it as yet another step in its path to boosting relations with countries in Southeast Asia, an increasingly important region economically and geopolitically for the bloc.\n\nNegotiations for an EU-Thailand Free Trade Agreement (ETFTA) were launched in March 2013 but put on hold following a military coup in Bangkok in May 2014, after which bilateral relations remained frosty for several years. The coup also put the brakes on the initial PCA deal — more limited than a full free trade agreement — which had been agreed in 2013.\n\nPartnership agreement returns to the table\n\nThe European Council, the EU's main decision-making body, gave the green light in late 2019 to restart formal talks again following a long-delayed general election in Thailand, which was won by the same military leaders who took power during the coup.\n\nThe first round of preparatory talks for the revised PCA began in July of last year. It was concluded after a seventh meeting this June. The two sides also renewed talks regarding the possible ETFTA.\n\nEU looks East for free trade deals\n\n\"The PCA will enhance the political dialogue on issues of global concern and will give more scope for mutually-beneficial cooperation in a wide number of policy areas,\" the European External Action Service (EEAS), responsible for the EU's foreign and defense policies, said in a statement.\n\n\"It will be a roadmap, which will positively frame EU-Thai relations in the years to come,\" it added.\n\nPaola Pampaloni, the deputy managing director of the EEAS, and Chulamanee Chartsuwan, deputy permanent secretary to Thailand's Foreign Ministry, closed the negotiating process for the PCA deal on Friday.\n\nPending institutional procedures from the EU and Thailand, it will be formally signed at a later date, David Daly, EU ambassador to Thailand, told DW.\n\nMutually beneficial deal\n\nThe PCA is an \"important vehicle to strengthen the dialogue in the economic and trade domain,\" said Guillaume Rebiere, executive director of the European Association for Business and Commerce in Thailand.\n\nBilateral trade in goods between the EU and Thailand rose to €35.4 billion ($35.16 billion) in 2021, up from €29.3 billion the previous year, according to EU data. The EU is the second-largest investor in Thailand, after Japan.\n\n\"Thailand is an important trade and political partner and, therefore, this agreement is also important in strengthening the role of the EU within Southeast Asia,\" Rebiere added. \"Both businesses and investors will be encouraged by the signing of this agreement.\"\n\nThe deal makes sense for both sides, noted Trinh Nguyen, a senior economist covering Emerging Asia at Natixis, an investment management firm. \"It would signal a boost to relations from both sides as they both are more willing and eager to work with one another to diversify sources of growth and investment,\" she added.\n\nPartners in diversification\n\nFor Thailand, long reliant on its vast tourism industry, the decline of Chinese visitors since the pandemic has forced it to rethink its dependence on Beijing and find other sources of growth. Bangkok is also conscious of the need to seek out trade links away from the US and China, two of its main partners.\n\n\"Expanding access to trade and investment with the EU, the largest economic bloc in the world, is part of that strategy,\" said Nguyen.\n\nThe EU is also \"warming up\" to Thailand as it seeks to diversify from China as geopolitical risks rise and as Brussels increasingly views Beijing as a competitor, she added.\n\n\"The willingness to negotiate with Thailand through the signing of the Framework Agreement is part of that growing closer in relations not just to Thailand but also to the rest of Southeast Asia and India,\" Nguyen said.\n\nIn December, the European Union and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will hold a summit of national leaders for the first time in Brussels, a milestone in bloc-to-bloc relations that celebrate their 45th anniversary this year.\n\nA free trade agreement next?\n\nThe PCA's conclusion may also indicate that both sides are inching closer toward a free trade agreement (FTA), which would be the third the EU has struck with a Southeast Asian country after landmark deals with Singapore and Vietnam.\n\n\"There is no immediate link between the PCA and the FTA process,\" stressed Daly, the EU ambassador to Bangkok.\n\nBut judging by how the EU has negotiated FTAs with other Asian countries, the timeline would suggest that a trade deal with Thailand would follow a PCA, said Nguyen. Vietnam, for instance, signed a similar PCA with the EU in 2015, four years before their landmark FTA was approved. \"We've still got other hurdles to cross but certainly [an FTA] is closer,\" she added.\n\nThe EU restarted talks following a general election in Thailand, which was won by the military leader Prayuth Chan-ocha\n\nBryan Tse, lead analyst for Thailand at the Economist Intelligence, reckons the FTA would be signed between 2024 and 2026 unless politics \"gets in the way.\"\n\nBangkok is currently on edge after the country's Constitutional Court ruled last week that Prayuth Chan-ocha, the prime minister, must temporarily step down as it considers whether he has exceeded an eight-year term limit in office that his own government introduced. Prayuth was the military chief who took power after the 2014 coup.\n\n\"The EU and Thailand are not particularly close economically, compared to China, US or other ASEAN members, so this is more of a diversification tactic for both parties and a reflection of the growing importance of Southeast Asia in terms of global trade for other countries,\" said Tse.\n\nEdited by: Alex Berry",
    "Tourist breaks Singaporean law by consuming cannabis in Thailand": "A Singaporean tourist says she didn’t mean to consume cannabis in Thailand in July. Weed might be legal in the Land of Smiles, but it is still a crime for Singaporeans to consume cannabis at home and abroad.\n\nSueanne said she ate a “very nice bowl of noodles” in Chiang Rai, northern Thailand, that were so delicious that she ordered them again the next day for breakfast.\n\nThe second time she ordered the dish, she noticed a little ganja leaf next to the picture of the dish on the menu. Sueanne enquired with the staff and soon found out that cannabis leaves were boiled into the dish, “like any other vegetable,” she said.\n\nThe woman said she mistook the boiled cannabis for morning glory – or water spinach – known as “kangkung” in Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Sueanne said she was glad her children didn’t try the dish.\n\nWhen cannabis was removed from Thailand’s list of illicit narcotics, Singapore’s Central Narcotics Bureau (CNS) swiftly reminded Singaporeans that consuming cannabis – inside or outside of Singapore’s borders – was a crime.\n\n“(Under) the Misuse of Drugs Act, any Singapore citizen or permanent resident found to have consumed controlled drugs outside Singapore will also be liable for the drug consumption offence.”\n\nSingaporeans convicted of drug consumption may be jailed for up to 10 years and fined up to 20,000 Singaporean dollars. The CNS said it would investigate any positive urine test result and regularly undertake drug tests at border checkpoints.\n\nThankfully for Sueanne, Singapore’s Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam recently assured worried Singaporean citizens that it is not usually considered an offence if drugs are consumed unwittingly or unknowingly.\n\nSueanne wouldn’t have got “high” from the noodle dish, because the high caused by cannabis comes from the component tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Thailand’s laws stipulate that an extract made from cannabis (such as a very nice bowl of noodles) must contain no more than 0.2% THC, which is a very minute amount.\n\nNevertheless, there is still a chance that the cannabis Sueanne consumed could show up in a urine test, which could get her into big trouble back in Singapore. Sueanne didn’t say if she was ever subject to a urine test upon her return home.\n\nThailand is a popular tourist destination for Singaporeans. Earlier this year, Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam expressed worries that the accessibility of cannabis in Thailand would pose a challenge to keeping Singapore drug-free.\n\nTo ease the worries of cannabis-fearing tourists, some popular tourist hotspots such as Chatuchak market in Bangkok have put up signs saying cannabis is not allowed on the premises.\n\nSOURCE: New Straits Times\n\nWin a 3-night beachfront stay at Four Points by Sheraton Phuket by taking a short Thaiger Survey HERE!",

Under such pressure, very few schools can continue to operate in China,\" Pan told DW.\n\nPlans to seek asylum thwarted\n\nPan and his church members arrived in South Korea between October and December 2019, just before the COVID pandemic forced China to close its borders.\n\nHowever, the Chinese government continued to harass them: Some church members and their family members in China received threats from China's Ministry of State Security.\n\nChina requires Christians to worship only at churches affiliated with religious institutions controlled by the Communist Party\n\n\"The Chinese embassy in South Korea called me twice and asked me to pick up a package over there,\" said Jing-jing Chen, another church member. \"Nobody sent anything to me, so I suspected it to be a trap. Chinese state security agents also kept asking my parents about when I would return to China.\"\n\nApart from ongoing threats from Beijing, church members were also told by immigration lawyers in South Korea that the chances of them being granted refugee status in South Korea were very slim, prompting them to reconsider the next best option for the group.\n\nAccording to the South Korean government's data, only 1% of asylum-seeker applications were approved in 2021.\n\n\"We knew if we kept staying in South Korea, we wouldn't be able to make it to our final destination, and we were done living without legal identities in a country,\" Pan told DW.\n\n\"We decided to go to Thailand and apply for refugee status with the United Nations Refugee Agency.\"\n\nHowever, there are other potential risks in Thailand.\n\nOver the last few years, several Chinese dissidents in the southeast Asian nation have been deported to China while waiting for the UN to approve their refugee status. This trend has raised concerns among Chinese asylum-seekers.\n\nChristian worshippers have seen their churches raided, while facing interrogations and surveillance\n\n\"We are well aware of the potential risks in Thailand, but since there is no future for us in South Korea, Thailand is an opportunity for our members,\" Pan said.\n\n'They keep following us'\n\nSoon after the church members arrived in Thailand last month, they noticed strangers following them.\n\n\"The day after we checked into our hotel, some people began to take photos and videos of us,\" Pan told DW.\n\n\"When I submitted our application to the UN Refugee Agency, a car followed me while continuing to film me. And during an interview at a restaurant, another guy took photos of me but was stopped by me and the reporter. However, we were too late to stop him from sending the photos out.\"\n\nChurch member Chen also told DW that they had changed hotels multiple times since arriving. \"Wherever we go, they follow us. They keep taking photos of us as well as sending different people to follow us,\" she said.\n\nPan admited that the level of harassment and threats towards him and other church members were higher than he originally expected.\n\n\"Now, I always contemplate whether I should leave the hotel or not,\" he told DW. \"While adults will occasionally go out to buy stuff, underage church members are afraid to leave the hotel. The threats against us have become huge obstructions to our lives.\"\n\nThe Golden Lampstand church in China's northern Shanxi province was demolished in 2018 using bulldozers and dynamite\n\nProtecting the persecuted\n\nPatrick Poon, a visiting researcher at the Institute of Comparative Law at Japan's Meiji University, told DW that the United Nations had to do more to ensure the safety of Chinese Christians seeking refuge in Thailand.\n\n\"They should ask special permission from the Thai government to provide shelters and protective measures for asylum-seekers,\" he said.\n\n\"Many of them need to find their next destinations on their own and they can't work. They are facing many issues about how to sustain their lives while waiting for the news about their refugee status. What the UN has done is far from enough. If they want to show that people can seek refuge in Thailand, they need to do more to ensure their safety,\" he added.\n\nChurch member Chen said that she hoped to take her two children to the United States, as religious freedom was guaranteed there.\n\n\"I want my children to be able to go to schools run by churches, and I want them to receive a Christian education,\" she told DW.\n\n\"Religious freedom and my children's right to receive education are the reasons why I decided to leave China in the first place.\"\n\nEdited by: Keith Walker",

    "Going with the flow on an impulsive trip to Thailand": "Listen 11 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nOn the southwestern coast of Thailand, limestone cliffs tower over seawater against the backdrop of swaying trees. Long-tail boats — the only means of transportation to Railay Beach — sit parked in the distance, neon-pink-and-green flags swaying at the bow. Sand bubbler crabs dip above and below the surface, leaving their intricate designs at the mercy of high tide and flip-flops. I’m sitting in a bar on the beach, watching water droplets fall down my ice-cold Singha beer, looking at the sunset glimmer on the water. Picturesque doesn’t even begin to describe this. There’s just one question on my mind: How did I end up here?\n\nA few weeks earlier, I was fantasizing about going somewhere — anywhere — far away. I craved the feeling of being lost in an unfamiliar city, soaking in its sounds, smells, energy. This led to casually browsing plane tickets to Southeast Asia, when a reasonably priced ticket to Bangkok popped up. Later that month, I boarded the plane with a friend who booked her trip a few days after mine.\n\nWhile jetting across the world on a whim admittedly made me feel pretty cocky, it turns out I’m part of a larger trend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to data from the online travel company Skyscanner, demand focused on the Asia-Pacific region — and Thailand, in particular — has taken off since coronavirus restrictions began to ease in April. During May and June, for example, it was the third most popular long-haul destination from France, where I live.\n\nBeyond the uptick in trips to the region, Matt Bradford, who analyzes trends and insights for Skyscanner, has identified short booking horizons — a window of 30 days or less between booking and takeoff — as a new behavior. He explained by phone that, in France during May and June, 39 percent of bookings made on the site were for departures within one month. (In the United States, that figure was 35 percent.)\n\nWhen the doors slide open at Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi Airport, it hits you: wet, sweltering heat. Within one minute, my skin was covered in a slick film of humidity and sweat, dripping down the back of my neck as we hopped into a cab. We drove past roadside dumpling joints, skyscrapers and a seemingly endless string of stalls selling sex toy souvenirs.\n\nThe next afternoon, after a delicious lunch at Rung Reung Pork Noodle — a bare-bones, plastic-stool, fan-blasting haven for pork meatballs, noodles and broth — we set off toward Wat Arun, a temple built during the Ayutthaya era on the bank of the Chao Phraya River. Its “prang” towers more than 200 feet overhead, intricately decorated with porcelain pieces and walkways that snake up and around it. As we were strolling through the grounds, a lady approached us offering a boat ride around a nearby floating market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur boat driver soon led us through Thonburi’s network of klongs, or canals, lined with worn wooden houses, many tilting on the stilts holding them above water. A woman wearing a straw hat with bows clipped onto the band slowly approached us on her long-tail boat, offering bracelets, key chains and flowery hair clips. After we politely declined, she reached into her cooler, emerging with a grin. “Beer?” While this normally wouldn’t send me over the edge with excitement, Bangkok had banned alcohol sales for 24 hours during its election, and a cold Chang sounded pretty good in that heat. I bought one for myself and our driver, and we continued to drift through the canals.\n\nI’m no floating-market expert, but let’s just say this one was slightly underwhelming; after a quick snack of fried quail eggs with soy sauce and sugar, we set off back toward Bangkok and spent the evening on a rooftop paying for drinks with crypto, the bar’s only payment option.\n\nThe next two days would see endless heaps of sausages splattering into hot oil on street food carts, 3 a.m. massages on Khaosan Road and walks down the side streets of Sukhumvit. Then, after being seduced by travelers and locals raving about the south — they generally urged us to avoid Phuket, the notorious destination for tourists looking to get lost in the black hole of its nightlife — we hopped on a plane.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the intense, electric urban energy of Bangkok, Krabi — a southern province on Thailand’s Andaman Sea — was a literal breath of fresh air. We hopped into a shuttle that made various drop-offs in towns throughout the area. The driver played American country music as we drove past lush greenery on winding roads, passing a shooting range on the way into Ao Nang. A tourist, probably in her 20s, was talking to the woman next to her. “We don’t really have a plan,” she said.\n\nThey weren’t the only ones.\n\nIn Krabi, we set off by long-tail boat to explore the Ko Poda, Ko Thap and Ko Khai (or “Chicken”) islands off the coast, within the Phi Phi Islands national park. To say our first stop looked like a postcard would be a vast understatement. If you’ve ever imagined yourself on a deserted island, gazing out into crystal-clear waters under the shade of a mangrove tree on a white-sand beach, this was that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was no one else in sight as we dived into the calm water, splashing around gleefully with silly grins on our faces. I soon started to notice some stinging on my upper arm. Thinking I was being a hypochondriac, I ignored it. A couple of minutes later, back onshore, my friend mentioned that her arm was stinging but reasoned that it was probably because of the saltwater-and-sunburn combination.\n\nWhen we finally connected the dots about our ailments, we strolled back to inspect the water. As it turns out, the deserted white-sand beach wasn’t deserted at all, but was instead full of massive translucent jellyfish, in the water and washed ashore, a small detail we didn’t register on our walk from the boat. Our driver didn’t seem too concerned, though. When asked whether the stings were dangerous, he laughed, shook his head and said, “No dead, no dead,” still chuckling as he returned to the stern.\n\nOn our last night, we returned to Railay Beach via long-tail boat, tilting dramatically against the waves, water splashing into the boat through the open sides. After wading through the water to get to shore, we dropped off our stuff and hit the beach bar. “Hotel California” played in the background as the sun disappeared over the horizon, revealing stars and the vast surrounding cliffs shining in the moonlight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, the power went out.\n\nAfter a few minutes, the bartender created a makeshift glowing lantern by putting his phone flashlight under a bottle of Curaçao. Candles were lit. We asked for another round. “Why not?” he replied.\n\nA wander through the pitch-black town revealed shadows of massage ladies, chatting quietly while huddled together, looking out onto the pathway. Bartenders hung out outside, just their silhouettes visible in the darkness. In one bar, candles cast a glowing light over a pool table beyond the open windowsills, an acoustic guitar player singing behind it. We spent a few hours in that bar as rains flooded the road outside.\n\nBehind us, the bartender kept laughing to himself, repeating, “Why not?” — seemingly the town’s unofficial catchphrase — every couple of minutes. We couldn’t make out the faces of the people opposite us, just their shadows. Reality felt conflated with a sort of dream world — in a good way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuddenly, the lights came on. Almost immediately, the place that couldn’t have felt farther away from home made me think of the bars on Rue de Lappe, the notoriously rowdy party street in my Paris neighborhood, characterized by neon lights and flaming shots. Acoustic music quickly faded behind the Top 40 songs blasting on the stereo, and fairy lights blinked aggressively on the walls. It was time to go. The next morning, I left Krabi, already feeling nostalgic as that night shifted from reality into memory on the journey back to Paris.\n\nI’m not advocating for always traveling without a plan. We missed a lot. The one thing we really wanted to do — travel by train from north to south — wasn’t possible without booking ahead. Our floating-market experience could have benefited from better research. We could have seen more sights. But if someone had asked me, “Would you like to take a rickety long-tail boat in high swells to this isolated beach town that will lose power, where you’ll be essentially stranded until morning?”\n\nI’d say, “Why not?”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRadziemski is a writer based in Paris.

    "Thailand Court Set to Rule on PM Prayuth’s Tenure on Sept. 30": "Thailand’s Constitutional Court has set the date when it will rule on the status of suspended Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha.\n\nThe nation’s highest court announced Wednesday that it will deliver its ruling on September 30 on whether or not Prayuth can remain in office.\n\nThe former military chief seized power in a 2014 coup that overthrew the democratically elected government of then-Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra. The opposition party has filed a legal challenge that Prayuth has exceeded the constitutionally-limited eight years in office.\n\nBut his supporters have argued that his tenure actually began in 2017 when Thailand’s new constitution took effect, or even as late as 2019 when parliament chose him to head a coalition government after parliamentary elections.\n\nSome information for this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters, Agence France-Presse.",
    "Airport expansion plans hastened across Thailand": "With High Season approaching and the Thai government predicting big numbers, airport expansion plans are being fast-tracked. One of Thailand’s goals as international travel begins to return in greater numbers is to become a transport hub for Southeast Asia. To help realise the goal and make room for an influx of travellers, facilities are being expanded in both domestic and international airports around the country.\n\nSmaller regional hubs race to expand and increase their capacity for domestic travellers. Krabi Airport in Southern Thailand will herald travellers to popular tourist destinations outside of Phuket. Khon Kaen Airport in the northeast will expand to accommodate more travellers to Isaan. Mae Sot Airport in the west will bring people to the Burmese border. And the new Betong Airport in the Deep South province of Yala will accommodate passengers near the Malaysian border.\n\nBKK\n\nBangkok’s Suvarnabhumi Airport is a primary focus, hoping to boost its hub status with new development. Expansions hope to allow the airport to accommodate up to 120 million passengers each year. The current capacity for the airport is about 45 million people per year, close to the total number of tourists that entered Thailand in 2019 before the pandemic.\n\nThe airport will expand from 51 to 79 gates with the construction of the satellite Terminal 1. That expansion is expected to be finished this year, along with the addition of a third runway. Other upgrades will be completed over the next several years.\n\nA plan for construction next April is expected to add 348,000 square metres to the passenger terminal north. That build is scheduled to start in January and be finished by June 2025. The passenger terminal east will also see an expansion of an extra 66,000 square metres over the next two years. Plans are being studied for the possibility to expand in the west another 66,000 square metres as well.\n\nDMK\n\nThe Airports of Thailand is working with the Department of Airports to expand regional airports in central Thailand as well as three major airports. Aside from Suvarnabhumi Airport, the secondary airport serving the greater Bangkok area, Don Mueang International Airport, will see upgrades. U-Tapao Airport in Rayong, the gateway to Pattaya in Chon Buri, it’s under expansion as well.\n\nDon Mueang plans to accommodate an extra 18 million travellers each year. They can currently handle 30 million passengers per year. Expansion plans call for 12 new gates for flights to park in a third terminal covering 155,000 square metres of space. The design is already finalized and bidding will begin soon for construction contracts.\n\nUTP\n\nU-Tapao Airport is much smaller than its Bangkok counterparts, currently able to host 1.5 million travellers per year. Ambitious expansion plans will construct a second terminal and expand the capacity to five million passengers yearly. That new terminal isn’t expected to open until 2027 though.\n\nAll of these airports under the AoT will work in sync with high-speed rail projects to move people around the area quickly and easily. The plan is part of the Eastern Economic Corridor programme designed to bring investment into the Eastern region of the country.\n\nSOURCE: Bangkok Post\n\nWin a 3-night beachfront stay at Four Points by Sheraton Phuket by taking a short Thaiger Survey HERE!",
    "EU and Thailand signs partnership for collaboration in frontier research": "A new initiative between the European Union and Thailand was launched today to encourage collaboration between leading Thai researchers and European Research Council (ERC) grantees and their teams. This joint scheme is the first of its kind targeting researchers in Thailand. It will promote cooperation between the Thai Programme Management Unit for Human Resources & Institutional Development, Research and Innovation (PMU-B) of the National Higher Education, Science, Research & Innovation Policy Council and the ERC.\n\n\n\nH.E. the European Union Ambassador to Thailand, David Daly, and the Director of PMU-B Prof. Dr. Sompong Klaynongsruang signed the new initiative today at a ceremony in Bangkok.\n\n\n\nEuropean Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth Mariya Gabriel said: “With the signing of this new initiative, a positive step has been taken to strengthen collaboration between the EU and the ASEAN region in scientific research. It will benefit both sides, with top Thai researchers joining teams led by outstanding scientists funded by the European Research Council.”\n\n\n\nERC President Prof. Maria Leptin, who attended the ceremony remotely, said: “We welcome this new agreement that is fully in line with the ERC’s openness to the world. Excellent science is intrinsically international; encouraging scientific exchange across continents can only benefit us all. This initiative will help ERC grantees to host top talent from Thailand and will facilitate interactions of Thai researchers with international partners. It’s a win-win.”\n\n\n\nProf. Dr. Sompong Klaynongsruang, PMU-B Director, stated: “The European Research Council is internationally recognised as one of the most successful frontier science programmes in the world. We are delighted for the bright young Thai researchers to gain world-class experience working alongside the ERC-funded research teams. We sincerely appreciate the European Commission’s and the ERC’s support and are confident that this initiative will lead to a long-term impactful collaboration between Thailand and the EU in frontier research.”\n\n\n\nThe scheme, formally called administrative arrangement (formerly “implementing arrangement), is open to top researchers supported by PMU-B. It will facilitate their temporary participation in ERC research groups in similar areas of research or on topics of mutual interest. Such single or multiple research visits can be short or long-term. This arrangement forms part of the ERC’s global outreach strategy that aims to make Europe a hub for research talent.\n\n\n\nBackground\n\n\n\nThe European Research Council, set up by the European Union in 2007 and marking its 15th anniversary this year, is the premier European funding organisation for excellent frontier research. It funds creative researchers of any nationality and age, to run projects based across Europe. The ERC offers four core grant schemes: Starting Grants, Consolidator Grants, Advanced Grants and Synergy Grants. With its additional Proof of Concept Grant scheme, the ERC helps grantees to bridge the gap between their pioneering research and early phases of its commercialisation.\n\n\n\nTo date, the ERC has funded over 11,000 top researchers at various stages of their careers, and over 80,000 postdoctoral fellows, PhD students and other staff working in their research teams. With grants open to talent of any nationality, the ERC aims to attract top researchers from across the world. So far, two Thai nationals have won ERC funding. The ERC also encourages non-European scientists to join ERC-funded teams. Around 17% of team members are non-European nationals.\n\nAfter the first initiative in 2012 to encourage talent backed by the US National Science Foundation, NSF, to join temporarily ERC teams, other Implementing Arrangements followed with prestigious funding bodies across different continents.\n\n\n\nThe ERC is led by an independent governing body, the Scientific Council. Since 1 November 2021, Maria Leptin is the President of the ERC. The overall ERC budget from 2021 to 2027 is more than €16 billion, as part of the Horizon Europe programme, under the responsibility of the European Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, Mariya Gabriel.\n\n\n\nERC and non-European researchers\n\nEU international R&I cooperation",
    "Agoda: Bangkok, Chiang Mai and Hua Hin cited as top Thailand destinations for international travellers": "\"Explore Thailand\" Campaign to Help Boost Thailand's Reopening\n\nBANGKOK, Sept. 19, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Thailand's borders are now fully open, and travellers from all over the world are heading back in droves to explore its unspoiled beaches and idyllic islands, serene countryside, and the bustle of Bangkok city. Agoda has revealed the top searched Thai destinations as it launches its dedicated Explore Thailand campaign offering great deals on top accommodation throughout Thailand.\n\nBeach resorts dominate the top seven searches, with Koh Chang, Koh Samui, Pattaya, and Phuket completing the top destination list according to Agoda. Find out what all the fuss is about.\n\nBangkok is a bustling metropolis that combines a rich culture and heritage with a hedonistic modern city of skyscrapers, party people and rooftop bars. Nestled in among some of the most well-known hotels in the world, are ancient temples, old markets and local neighbourhoods to explore.\n\nA city that never sleeps, Bangkok truly has something for everyone. From its burgeoning food scene, with street vendors serving delicious Thai staples at all hours, to gourmet restaurants, and its diverse shopping experience, the city is full of incredible experiences. Designer brands jostle for attention in Bangkok's top malls dotted along the Bangkok Train System, while tourists and locals alike flock to markets such as Khlong Ong Ang Walking Street near Chinatown and Chatuchak market. Escape from the toots of the tuk tuks to the Green Lung or newly opened Benjakitti Forest Park and enjoy a slower pace for a while.\n\nChiang Mai in the north has always been a popular spot for backpackers and locals alike, and is growing in recognition from a wider traveler demographic seeking out its temples and slightly cooler climes. There are many majestic temples dotted throughout the city and no visit is complete without a visit to one. Explore Prasat Temple with its Lanna architectural style believed to date back 500 years. While not as famous as other nearby temples, it has interesting and unique features that make this temple worth visiting, such as the entrance panels and pillars that are intricately decorated with carved flower motifs in the Lanna style, and the short tunnel that connects the viharn (a prayer hall) to the chedi (pagoda) behind it.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor something closer to nature, Royal Park Rajapruek has more than 200 acres to explore and features tropical flowers and fauna - a World of Insects, a garden of Rare Plants, an Orchid Garden, and Gardens for the King. It also includes authentic Lanna architecture of Ho Kham Luang Royal Pavilion letting visitors revel in traditional northern architecture. Don't worry about getting round all of the 200 acres – there is a free tram service, or bicycle rentals for the more active.\n\nFamous Beaches and Islands\n\nFamed for its bountiful palm edged tropical beaches with white sand and turquoise seas, for beach lovers Thailand doesn't disappoint.\n\nOnly a few hours drive from Bangkok, travellers can explore the Thai Royal family's favoured destination of Hua Hin of the Gulf of Thailand, famed for its Khao Tao Beach – great for kite surfing, and playing in the waves. Head the other way out of the city for a different beach experience visiting Pattaya, renowned for its party scene and easy access to the city.\n\nSlightly further afield but well worth jumping on a plane for, are family favourites Koh Samui and Phuket, and the island of Koh Chang. Havens for beachcombers and those looking to unwind and relax, these islands are home to some of Thailand's most beautiful beaches.\n\nPhuket, the biggest of these islands has a number of long white sandy beaches at Surin, Kamala Bay, and Karon Beach. For those willing to get off the beaten track, Freedom Beach is nestled in the valley between Patong and Karon beaches. A jungle trek or boat ride is the only way to access this unspoiled beach. It stretches 300 meters, featuring clear turquoise sea water against a backdrop of colourful green jungle. The beach is an ideal spot for visitors to swim, sunbathe and snorkel. There is also a restaurant serving simple food and drinks.\n\nFor a little culture and a spectacular view visit The Big Buddha, a 45m high statue made of white jade marble perches on the Nakkerd Hills between Chalong and Kata in Phuket.\n\nOn Koh Chang, accessible from Trad, Klong Prao Beach is widely considered as one of the most beautiful beaches on the island. Large trees lined along the beach provide shade for beachgoers to lay back and soak up the sun or even have a picnic. The water is shallow for most of the day making it an ideal spot for children to take a dip or anyone who likes to paddle. Although there is no lively shopping street, accommodation and restaurants are easy to find in the northern and southern parts of the beach.\n\nTo really get away from it all, Salakphet Mangrove Walkway or known locally as the red bridge stretches through the Salakphet Mangrove Forest. Along the way, branches that have inclined towards each other make a seemingly beautiful arch, shading the walkway. It's the perfect place to get away from city lights as green hills can be seen in the distance with almost no buildings in sight at all.\n\nLike Phuket, Koh Samui has an abundance of beaches to explore for daytime sunbathing and they also come alive in the evening with beach bars and diners all along Chawang beach Fisherman's Village Walking Street takes place every Friday on Bhoput Beach. It is one of the biggest markets on the island and it has an array of small stalls and boutique shops that sell delicious food, lovely handicrafts, musical instruments and unique accessories.\n\nTake a trip on a traditional long-tail boat out to Pig Island, whose official name is Mudsum Island, but the name Pig Island is more commonly used due to the 10 pigs that roam the beach after they were saved by a local bar man.\n\nThe Explore Thailand' Campaign runs from 19-23 September 2022, with a stay period within 90 days of booking. With this promotion, travellers can get additional discounts when booking hotels in Thailand.

    "Thailand’s contentious plan to curtail bottom trawling unfolds in slow motion": "To rebuild its dwindling fish stocks, Thailand has implemented a series of reforms to its fishing sector since 2015, reining in illegal fishing while curtailing catches and the size of its commercial fishing fleet.\n\nIn July, the Thai government announced a ban on new registrations for bottom trawlers, a particularly destructive and indiscriminate kind of fishing vessel, coupled with a $30 million buyout program for them and other gear types.\n\nSmall-scale fishers say the reforms don’t go far enough to protect fish stocks, while commercial fishers say the new rules are hobbling their industry and should be scrapped.\n\nChiang Mai, THAILAND — Piya Thedyam was born into a fisherman’s family and first went to sea with his father at age 12. “I didn’t like it and almost ran away,” he said. “But at some point, he cultivated a love for the sea in me.”\n\nFor a time, Thedyam worked on large commercial fishing vessels where he witnessed the sea being exploited with powerful, destructive equipment. At 19, he’d had enough of that and he began sailing his own tiny fishing boat from his home in Prachuap Khiri Khan province, exploring the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea while fishing mainly local mackerel. Eventually he acquired a fleet of four vessels, some not so tiny.\n\nThedyam said that over the past two decades he has come to know the sea up close and well. In 2004, the sea sent him a signal. “We found mackerel that used to be abundant in the area were missing. I could feel the crisis coming,” he said.\n\nThailand, with its 300,000-square-kilometer (116,000-square-mile) exclusive economic zone, was the regional hub for Indo-Pacific or short mackerel (Rastrelliger brachysoma). The fish were so abundant that they became a household staple. Mackerel chili, Nam prik pla tu, is commonly known as the “food for all,” a good meal at a humble cost. As one popular Thai song has it, “Who cares for steak or stew while we have plenty of mackerel chili?”\n\nBut Thailand’s Indo-Pacific mackerel catches have plummeted, from over 160,000 metric tons in 1999 down to just 27,000 metric tons in 2020. And the dwindling mackerel and other fish are just one among a suite of problems Thailand’s fisheries have been grappling with, including overfishing, illegal fishing, human trafficking and forced labor. In response, the country has implemented a series of reforms since 2015. These aim, in part, to reduce overall catches by reining in the number of vessels plying the country’s waters.\n\nOne of the main targets is bottom trawlers, fishing vessels that drag heavy nets across the seafloor, churning up seabed habitat and scooping up species indiscriminately. The mackerel declines, for instance, are widely blamed on bottom trawlers catching juveniles before they can breed and destroying mackerel nurseries. Researchers have also found that bottom trawling releases a substantial amount of carbon stored in the seabed, with implications for climate change and far-reaching effects on marine ecosystems. In July, the Thai government announced a ban on new registrations for trawlers coupled with a $30 million buyout program for them and other fishing vessels. But while the moves to restrict bottom trawling are drawing support and calls for further action from small-scale fishers like Thedyam, they’re eliciting howls of pain and consternation from fishers a little further up the seafood chain.\n\nYellow card sparks series of reforms\n\nThailand has long been one of the world’s largest exporters of marine seafood. The value was more than $6 billion in 2014, the year before the European Commission issued the country a “yellow card” warning, threatening to ban imports to Europe unless it addressed its unsustainable fishing practices.\n\nThe prospect of losing nearly $800 million in seafood sales to Europe prompted the Thai military junta in power at that time to launch a major overhaul of the industry and a crackdown on illegal fishing. The measures it implemented were wide-ranging, including tightened surveillance via a new vessel monitoring system, enhanced enforcement of regulations and stiffer penalties for noncompliance, even sinking confiscated boats to create artificial coral reefs.\n\nSince 2015, starting even before the yellow card, the government has seized 77 illegal fishing vessels, some as large as 400 gross tonnage. Within 6 months of the yellow card, the government revoked the license and registration of 8,024 commercial and artisanal vessels it accused of violating fisheries laws. It started with the highest priority group: 500 bottom trawlers.\n\nThe government also announced the arrest of close to 200 unregistered fishing vessels deemed stateless and accused of violating international fishing regulations in Thai waters. Pictures of the vessels and the crew were published in the state gazette.\n\nThe European Commission lifted the yellow card four years later, in 2019, the same year elections returned Thailand to being a constitutional monarchy. However, the government remains heavily controlled by the previous regime’s military leaders and it continued its pledge to curtail overfishing and the country’s oversize fishing fleet.\n\nBetween 1992 and 2005, Thailand caught more than 2.5 million metric tons of seafood annually in marine fisheries, a stretch of 14 consecutive years, according to government statistics. It was a swift jump; the country had only begun consistently catching upwards of 2 million metric tons annually a few years earlier, in 1986. Prior to the 2015 yellow card warning, Thailand’s fishing catch reached 32.8% over the maximum sustainable yield (MSY), a measure of how much fish can be caught without depleting stocks, according to a government report. In other words, overfishing was a big problem.\n\n“Fishing in the old days was based on maximum economic yield,” Chalermchai Suwannarak, director general of the country’s Department of Fisheries, told Mongabay. “Thai fleets have traveled as far as Australia and Africa to get as much as possible on each trip. With higher demand both domestically and internationally, the numbers have grown fast beyond control. Laws and regulations could not keep up.”\n\nSuwannarak said the government’s plan is to downsize both the catches and the fishing fleet until the catch volume is balanced with the marine resources, using an MSY of 1.5 million metric tons as a guide. It represents a major shift, replacing maximum economic yield with maximum sustainable yield.\n\nThe country appears to have achieved that goal: catches have been below 1.5 million metric tons since 2014, according to the latest official Thai fisheries statistics, published in May. And while the government is continuing to talk about downsizing the commercial fishing fleet, focusing on trawlers, it appears the 8,024 vessels in question have been out of commission since 2015.\n\nFor years, Thailand had no formal count of how many vessels were fishing its waters. In 2015, the government’s first big survey showed the country had more than 13,000 registered commercial fishing vessels — those with gross tonnage of 10 or greater. By 2021, the official number was down to 10,000. By contrast, artisanal vessels ballooned from 27,000 to more than 50,000 over the same period.\n\nOn July 1, at the U.N. Ocean Conference in Lisbon, Suwannarak presented Thailand’s commitment to the international community, announcing a permanent ban on new registrations for bottom trawlers and a $30 million buyout scheme for 1,838 of the docked vessels deemed only to have violated registration requirements, including 541 bottom trawlers. The announcement won kudos from international conservation NGOs.\n\nHowever, the promise of a bottom-trawler ban is not new. The country stopped issuing new registrations for bottom trawlers on a temporary basis in 2016, in response to the yellow card ordeal. And it initiated the $30 million buyout scheme back in 2019, targeting the same vessels. Since then it has compensated owners of only about half of the trawlers that are at the top of the list, with prolonged inspections for each vessel that can take four years or longer.\n\nThat $30 million still has yet to be secured, and it may not be enough, Suwannarak told Mongabay. “We need to ask for approval from the cabinet. I hope it won’t take long,” he said. “We still can’t estimate the exact amount of the budget needed. It takes time to inspect each ship for size and condition. Considering there are 2,000 ships on the waiting list, it must be a huge amount of money and time. ”\n\nStill, Suwannarak said the plan is proceeding well. “We saw the commercial fleet as 20% oversize. The downsizing to around 8,000 is on the right track,” he said.\n\nYet he said much more needs to be done to ensure proper use of marine resources. “The problem is not only with highly destructive tools like trawlers,” he said. “There is fishing in sensitive areas, fishing during the spawning season, fishing in areas with juvenile marine animals. These need to be rigorously controlled.”\n\nA new law, the 2019 National Maritime Interests Protection Act, aims to improve enforcement. It established the Maritime Enforcement Command Center led by the Navy commander, which reports directly to the prime minister and has one thousand staff.\n\nA blow for commercial fishers\n\nCommercial fishers have been fighting the reforms, mainly with petitions and closed-door discussions. In December 2019, they took to the street. Hundreds of people camped out for two days in front of the Ministry of Agriculture, which oversees fishing policy, demanding the government relax all restrictions, compensate fishers and allow their moored vessels to fish again.\n\n“We have been forced to moor and stop fishing,” Mongkol Sukcharoenkana, president of the National Fisheries Association of Thailand, which represents commercial fishing interests, told Mongabay. “Our registration has been ripped off overnight without warning or trial. We have been treated like criminals.”\n\nSukcharoenkana said Thailand’s commercial fleet is shriveling as a result of the new measures and “discrimination” against the commercial sector. At the same time, the government allowed the number of small-scale fishing boats to double. Sukcharoenkana said that this fleet was also guilty of fishing undersized fish.\n\n“No compensation nor assistance for over 40,000 of our seamen. Many plunged into despair and some have committed suicide. Do you think you can push the fishing industry ahead with those 50,000 small fishing rods?” said Sukcharoenkana, a boat owner himself. He was shouting, a habit he later explained came from a career spent giving orders to his crew over the din of boat engines.\n\nAs for the government’s buyout plan, Sukcharoenkana was pessimistic. “I don’t believe they will pay. They have kept bragging about big deals for four years but have done too little. I don’t think they will do any better after taking a world tour pretending everything is all right,” he said.\n\nSukcharoenkana lives in Samut Songkhram, Thailand’s fishing capital. It has the biggest fleets, the biggest pier and the biggest fish market. Like Thedyam, Sukcharoenkana has made a living from the sea since his youth. He said it was sad to see his world crumbling so quickly: thousands lost their careers and property; his country has lost a lucrative source of income. The downsized fleet will bring Thailand’s heyday of seafood exports to an end. “We lost $5 billion over seven years just to make the EU happy,” he said.\n\nThe fisherman and the bulldozer\n\nA 12-hour drive south of where Sukcharoenkana lives, Beeyoh Ampanniyom has been selling fish her family catches at the market in Ban Na Thap, a small town in Songkhla province, for the past 20 years. There’s been no pla tu, or local mackerel, for sale here lately, she told Mongabay.\n\n“Mackerel sold in the market comes from as far as India and Oman,” she said. “Only a few of them have been found in our sea in recent years. The price is not cheap anymore either.”\n\nAccording to the Thai Sea Watch Association, a civil society organization based in Songkhla, Thailand now imports 200,000 metric tons of mackerel each year. With higher demand, imports could soon reach 300,000 metric tons, according to the association. The price has tripled in the last decade.\n\n“With that, it is not a fish for all anymore,” the association’s president, Wichoksak Ronnarongpairee, said.\n\nOn May 27, just before the monsoon arrived, Thedyam, Ronnarongpairee and an energetic group of fishermen set out to sea in their small boats. They had their fishing rods and nets, as usual. But nothing was usual about that trip.\n\nFrom Pattani province just south of Songkhla, in the country’s deep south, they took a 13-day sea trip to Bangkok, the capital. They docked their boats in front of Parliament and entered the building.\n\n“Bring back our mackerel!” they shouted, and poured a handful of tiny, smelly dried mackerel onto the lobby floor. They met with the minister who oversees fishery policy, demanding “serious control” of the capture of juvenile sea animals by big gear like bottom trawlers. It was a call they’d been making for the past 7 years, with little effect on their scant catches.\n\n“While our over 50,000 traditional fishing boats have been waiting patiently for mature fish, large fisheries took them all with more powerful equipment: the bottom trawlers,” Ronnarongpairee told Mongabay. “[They] wiped everything out like a bulldozer.”\n\nThedyam said what bothers him most is that the small fish, once netted, are regarded as “trash” seafood and end up being sold as cheap animal food.\n\n“We have thrown away our future food down to animal feeders, letting us starve with the scarcity of affordable food,” Thedyam said. “The benefit surely goes only to the big fishery products and animal feed industries.”\n\nThe group vowed to return if Parliament did not act within 30 days.\n\nWill it work?\n\nChavalit Vidthayanon, an ichthyologist and board member with the Seub Nakhasathien Foundation, an environmental institute in Bangkok, recalled an early lesson about bottom trawlers. Back when he was a third-year student in fisheries science, a professor showed his class sonar scans of Thailand’s seabed.\n\n“For the Gulf of Thailand, the seabed was flat and clear as a newly mowed football field,” he said. “We scanned the seas nearby, like those of Cambodia. It is not as flat as ours.” The professor attributed the difference to bottom trawling sweeping away everything in its path.\n\nYet Vidthayanon said his own research indicated that bottom trawling isn’t the only widespread fishing practice yielding devastating catches of Thailand’s juvenile fish. Night fishing with high-power light lures did the same, he said. In 2021, 1,929 of these vessels were roaming Thai waters. He’s been arguing for decades the practice should stop, with little effect — a fact he attributed to a lack of empirical research that in turn stemmed from the government’s failure to appreciate or fund marine conservation science.\n\nInstead, he said, “We all focus only on the bottom trawler.”\n\nNevertheless, Vidthayanon said the national goal of reducing and keeping catches to 1.5 million metric tons per year was worthy and achievable with the downsizing scheme.\n\n“Theoretically, I would say it works,” he said. But he expressed concern about the government’s ability to enforce the rules in the long run, and also to address lesser-known destructive practices, like light-lure fishing. Vidthayanon also called for regulations barring the purchase and processing of undersized seafood, and for truthful labeling of seafood products as necessary steps to restoring Thai fish stocks.\n\nEven so, Vidthayanon said the government’s years-long reforms are starting to pay off. He said he’s witnessed the revival of marine life in certain places after years of strict practice, such as dolphins reappearing close to shore and mackerel starting to return to the sea near Songkhla. “That’s a very good sign,” he said.\n\nMore than two months have passed since Thedyam and his fellow protesters took their sea trip to Bangkok. Their 30-day deadline for lawmakers to regulate the capture of juvenile fish has passed with no action.\n\nThey said the time had come for another trip to Bangkok. This time they vowed to meet with the prime minister himself.\n\nBanner image: Fishing vessels in Thailand.
