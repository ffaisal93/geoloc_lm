    "Ebola Disease caused by Sudan virus - Uganda": "Outbreak at a glance\n\nOn 20 September 2022, Uganda health authorities declared an outbreak of Ebola disease, caused by Sudan virus, following laboratory confirmation of a patient from a village in Madudu sub-county, Mubende district, central Uganda.\n\nAs of 25 September 2022, a cumulative number of 18 confirmed and 18 probable cases have been reported from Mubende, Kyegegwa and Kassanda districts, including 23 deaths, of which five were among confirmed cases (CFR among confirmed cases 28%). This is the first Ebola disease outbreak caused by Sudan virus (SUDV) in Uganda since 2012.\n\nDescription of the outbreak\n\nOn 20 September 2022, the health authorities in Uganda declared an outbreak of Ebola disease caused by Sudan virus (SUDV), after a case was confirmed in a village of Madudu sub-county in Mubende district, central Uganda.\n\nThe case was a 24-year-old male who developed a wide range of symptoms on 11 September including high-grade fever, tonic convulsions, blood-stained vomit and diarrhoea, loss of appetite, pain while swallowing, chest pain, dry cough and bleeding in the eyes. He visited two private clinics, successively between 11-13 and 13-15 September without improvement. He was then referred to the Regional Referral Hospital (RRH) on 15 September where he was isolated as a suspected case of viral haemorrhagic fever. A blood sample was collected on 17 September and sent to the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) in Kampala where RT- PCR tests conducted were positive for SUDV on 19 September. On the same day, the patient died.\n\nResults of preliminary investigations identified a number of community deaths from an unknown illness in Madudu and Kiruma sub-counties of Mubende district reported in the first two weeks of September. These deaths are now considered to be probable cases of Ebola caused by SUDV.\n\nAs of 25 September 2022, a cumulative number of 36 cases (18 confirmed and 18 probable cases) have been reported from Mubende (14 confirmed and 18 probable), Kyegegwa (three confirmed cases) and Kassanda (one confirmed case) districts. Twenty-three deaths have been recorded, of which five were among confirmed cases (CFR among confirmed cases 28%). Of the total confirmed and suspected cases, 62% are female and 38% are male. There are currently 13 confirmed cases hospitalized. The median age of the cases is 26 years (range 1 year to 60 years). A cumulative number of 223 contacts have been listed.\n\nEpidemiology of the disease\n\nAccording to the International Classification of Disease for filoviruses (ICD-11) released in May 2019, Ebola disease is now sub-categorized depending on the causative virus. Outbreaks of Ebola disease caused by Sudan virus are named Sudan Virus Disease (SVD) outbreaks. Prior to May 2019 all viruses causing Ebola disease were grouped together. Based on the results of laboratory tests, this outbreak is caused by Sudan virus.\n\nSudan virus disease is a severe, often fatal illness affecting humans. Sudan virus was first reported in southern Sudan in June 1976, since then the virus has emerged periodically and up to now, seven outbreaks caused by SUDV have been reported, four in Uganda and three in Sudan. The estimated case fatality ratios of SVD have varied from 41% to 100% in past outbreaks.\n\nThe virus is introduced into the human population through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals such as fruit bats, chimpanzees, gorillas, monkeys, forest antelope or porcupines found ill or dead or in the rainforest. The virus then spreads through human-to-human transmission via direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with either blood or body fluids of a person who is sick with or has died from SVD or objects that have been contaminated with body fluids (like blood, faeces, vomit) from a person sick with SVD or the body of a person who died from SVD.\n\nThe incubation period ranges from 2 to 21 days. People infected with Sudan virus cannot spread the disease until they develop symptoms, and they remain infectious as long as their blood contains the virus. Symptoms of SVD can be sudden and include fever, fatigue, muscle pain, headache, and sore throat later followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, symptoms of impaired kidney and liver function. In some cases, the patient might present both internal and external bleeding (for example, bleeding from the gums, or blood in the stools).\n\nThe diagnosis of SVD can be difficult, as early nonspecific manifestation of the disease may mimic other infectious diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever and meningitis. Confirmation is made using numerous diagnostic methods including RT-PCR. Supportive care - rehydration with oral or intravenous fluids - and treatment of specific symptoms improve survival.\n\nThere are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of Sudan virus disease.\n\nUganda has reported four SVD outbreaks, in 2000, 2011 and 2012 (two outbreaks). Uganda also reported a Bundibugyo virus disease outbreak in 2007 and an Ebola virus disease outbreak in 2019.\n\nPublic health response\n\nCoordination\n\nThe Ministry of Health (MOH) established a National Task Force, with WHO providing technical support\n\nThe Incidence Management Team was activated both within the MOH and the WHO country office\n\nThe MOH Incident Commander has been deployed to Mubende District to support response efforts in the affected region\n\nWHO is supporting the orientation of the leadership at the Regional Referral Hospital and the district health team on early identification and case management\n\nA response plan is being developed and priority actions have been identified\n\nSurveillance and Laboratory\n\nWHO has supported the activation of surveillance structures in districts\n\nContact tracing and active case finding are ongoing\n\nWHO has deployed a technical team in Mubende district to support surveillance\n\nCase Management\n\nWHO has supported the assessment of the isolation unit at the regional referral Hospital and dispatched an Ebola disease kit and tent for the isolation of patients\n\nWHO has deployed a central team of experts to support the establishment of a treatment unit in the Regional Referral Hospital\n\nInfection prevention and control (IPC) teams were deployed to support capacity building of health workers in IPC and the establishment of screening and triage at all health facilities in affected districts\n\nCommunication and Risk Communication\n\nAs part of the communication and risk communication activities, WHO provided technical support for the organization of the press conference on Ebola and the development and dissemination of a press statement by the Ministry of Health\n\nCurrently, WHO is supporting the review of Information, Education and Communication (IEC) material for dissemination to the public\n\nWHO risk assessment\n\nUganda has experience in responding to Ebola virus disease and Sudan virus disease outbreaks, and necessary action has been initiated quickly. The current outbreak is the first Ebola disease outbreak caused by Sudan virus in Uganda since 2012.\n\nIn the absence of licensed vaccines and therapeutics for prevention and treatment of Sudan virus disease, the risk of potential serious public health impact is high. Community deaths and care of patients in private facilities and hospitals and other community health services with limited protection and infection prevention and control measures entail a high risk of many transmission chains. Investigations are ongoing to determine the scope of the outbreak and the possibility of spreading to other districts. Importation of cases to neighbouring countries cannot be ruled out at this stage.\n\nAccording to the information currently available, the overall risk has been assessed as high at national level considering: (i) the confirmed Sudan virus and the lack of an authorized vaccine (ii) the possibility that the event started three weeks before the identification of the index case and several transmission chains have not been not tracked; (iii) patients presented at various facilities with suboptimal infection, prevention and control (IPC) practices including inadequate use of personal protective equipment (PPE); the patients died and were traditionally buried with large gathering ceremonies; (iv) although the country has developed an increased capacity to respond to Ebola outbreaks over recent years, and has a local capacity that can be easily mobilized and organised with available resources to mount a robust response, the system could be overwhelmed if the number of cases increases and the outbreak spreads to other sub-counties, districts and regions, as the country simultaneously responds to multiple emergencies, including anthrax, COVID-19, Rift Valley fever and Yellow fever, as well as flooding and prevailing food insecurity.\n\nIn addition, the outbreak was detected among individuals living around an active local gold mine. Mobility among traders of this commodity is likely to be high, and the declaration of the outbreak may cause some miners already incubating the disease to flee.\n\nThe currently affected Mubende district has no international borders. Nevertheless, the risk of international spread cannot be ruled out due to the active cross-border population movement. In addition, investigations are ongoing to establish transmission chains and the scope of the outbreak is yet to be determined.\n\nAt Regional and Global levels, the overall risk has been assessed as low.\n\nWHO advice\n\nEffective outbreak control relies on applying a package of interventions, including case management, surveillance and contact tracing, an optimal laboratory service, implementation of infection prevention and control measures in health care and community settings, safe and dignified burials and community engagement and social mobilization. Community engagement is essential to successfully controlling outbreaks. Raising awareness of risk factors for Ebola infection and protective measures that individuals can take is an effective way to reduce human transmission.\n\nEarly initiation of supportive treatment has been shown to significantly reduce deaths from Ebola disease. There is a need to strengthen surveillance and other response activities to contain the possibility of exponential spread.\n\nBased on available evidence the ERVEBO vaccine — used in the recent responses against the Ebola virus disease outbreaks — will not provide cross-protection against the Sudan virus disease.\n\nThe Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) vaccine called Zabdeno/Mvabea against Ebola has only been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) against Ebola virus disease and has not been tested against Sudan virus disease. This vaccine is administered on a two-dose schedule and requires 56 days between the two doses. The first dose provides protection against the Zaire ebolavirus and the second dose was designed to provide protection against other species of the virus, including Sudan. However, this multiantigen protection has not been demonstrated with clinical data. Even if the vaccine was tested and proved to be effective against Sudan ebolavirus, it would only provide protection some days after the second dose is administered. This means the vaccine is not appropriate for outbreak response.\n\nWHO advises against any restrictions on travel and/or trade to Uganda based on available information for the current outbreak.\n\nFurther information\n\nCitable reference: World Health Organization (26 September 2022).

    "Uganda: Opposition kicks off Consultations on Copyright Law": "Opposition MPs have started holding stakeholder engagements with a view of improving a draft private Members’ Bill that seeks to amend the 2006 Copyright and Neighbouring Rights Act.\n\nThe Bill is sponsored by the Shadow Minister for Culture and Performing Arts, also Mawokota North MP, Hillary Innocent Kiyaga (NUP).\n\nThe first stakeholder meeting was held on Friday, September 23, 2022, at Parliament under the chairmanship of the Leader of the Opposition in Parliament (LOP), Hon Mathias Mpuuga, and drew the participation of officials from the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs led by the Deputy Solicitor General, Pius Biribonwoha, Uganda Registration Services Bureau (URSB) and representatives from the arts industry.\n\nThe proposed amendment seeks to close gaps in the 2006 law to recognize and protect the rights of a composer of artistic work and to streamline the registration of copyrights among others.\n\nThe Registrar General, Mercy Kainobwisho told the meeting that while her agency, URSB recognizes that there are gaps in the existing law coupled with implementation challenges, there is no need for a Private Members’ Bill her entity had already engaged Uganda Law Reform Commission to process an amendment that would lead to the domestication of international treaties on copyright and audiovisual performances.\n\n“The provisions of this Bill and the proposed amendments of the current Act may be parallel to the steps URSB is taking to amend the Act,” Kainobwisho said.\n\nHer submissions were however challenged by MPs, Abdulhu Byakatonda (Ind., Workers), Geoffrey Kayemba Solo (NUP, Bukomansimbi South) and Kiyaga. Their concerns were amplified by artistes, Hannington Bugingo (comedian) and Sylver Kyagulanyi from the Copyright Institute.\n\n“We wish to have this law amended in the areas of regulation, administration and protection. Regulation is so pertinent because we already have an existing issue with [Uganda Communications Commission] UCC,” Kyagulanyi said in reference to the stage plays and public performance rules which were announced by UCC in 2019.\n\n“We the creatives need to be regulated but what UCC is doing is an exhibition of the gap in the current law. UCC is using a 1964 draconian law – The Stage Plays and Public Entertainment Act which ought to be repealed. UCC would be within their mandate if they try to regulate broadcast but are trying to [stretch their mandate] to the regulation of everything including creativity and creative work,” he added.\n\nThe meeting later agreed to a harmonization of the positions of the two sides and hold joint consultations to have the legislation processed within the current financial year.\n\n“With these very good proposals, if we don’t sit and agree on the issues as we have heard them, we [risk] talking about the 2022 law the same way we are talking about the 2006 law,” Biribonwoha said.\n\nDistributed by APO Group on behalf of Parliament of the Republic of Uganda.",
    "Uganda: Is the First Lady flying above the vice president?": "Ugandan First Lady and Minister of Education and Sports Janet Kataha Museveni forced her way into politics in 2006 as a member of parliament, something that President Yoweri Museveni and other high-ranking members of the ruling party never supported. She became a junior minister three years later.\n\nPolitics is a path she never thought she would take, Janet wrote in her memoir, My Life’s Journey. “Of all things I thought I would ever do in my life, getting into active politics was never on my list,” she wrote. Janet, who is a devoted Christian, attributed her her change of mind to calling from God. ‘The idea seemed ludicrous,’ she wrote.\n\nJanet is ranked 10th on the order of precedence as per Uganda’s constitution and eight steps below the vice president, who is second to the president. But in recent months, the vice president has been representing the first lady at events, the most recent being when Alupo represented Janet in Israel at a graduation ceremony of Ugandan students whose education was sponsored by the Israeli government. Neither the president’s nor the vice president’s spokespeople responded to questions.",
    "Inter-Agency Situation Report - Uganda Refugee Emergency (9 - 15 September 2022) - Uganda": "Uganda continues to receive new arrivals from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and South Sudan, through the Southwestern and Northern borders. The security situation in all operational areas is unpredictable as armed conflicts are still active in DRC and South Sudan.\n\nHeavy rains are causing delays and postponement of service delivery, flooding of settlement areas and damage to shelters as well as latrines.\n\nThe new arrival trends from South Sudan and DRC are high, putting pressure on available facilities at collection points and transit centres across the operation. The average latrine coverage ratio is 1:20 individuals. Due to the high numbers, it is now 1:434 individuals. The holding capacity at Nyakabande transit centre (Kisoro district) is overstretched by 87 per cent (capacity of 7,200 with 13,465 individuals currently).\n\nLokung collection point in Lamwo district, is over stretched by 261 per cent (capacity of 560 with 2,019 individuals currently), while Kagoma reception centre (Kikuube district) by 97 per cent (capacity of 1,000 holds 1966 individuals). The pressure is partly attributed to lack of core relief items (CRIs) affecting relocation to settlements. There is need for additional funds to cater for procurement of CRIs.",
    "US Overtakes Uganda in Buying Kenyan Goods": "New figures from Kenya's National Bureau of Statistics show the United States has overtaken Uganda as the largest buyer of Kenyan goods.\n\nThe numbers from Kenya's National Bureau of Statistics show that between January and June 2022, Kenya's exports to the United States totaled 38.8 billion Kenyan shillings — the equivalent of about $321 million.\n\nUganda's imports from Kenya dipped to about $300 million.\n\nAccording to the report, the jump was caused mainly by increased sales of Kenyan clothing apparel to the U.S.\n\nEconomists such as Ken Gichinga say the figures are a sign of Kenya’s deepening bilateral relationship with the U.S., including increased direct flights to New York.\n\n\"Americans have a bigger purchasing power for products in Kenya,\" Gichinga said. \"You find that American investors will find it a very good time to be able to purchase assets and buy things in Kenya because now, the market is in their favor.\"\n\nUganda has been the biggest buyer of Kenyan exports for over a decade. But a Kenyan publication, Business Daily, reports that Uganda's imports from Kenya have dropped as investors set up Ugandan factories to manufacture goods previously imported from Kenya, such as edible oils and cement.\n\nWangari Muikia, a Kenyan economist, said the country's strong relations with the U.S., backed by the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), will likely continue to thrive as the new government of President William Ruto is keen on more American partnerships.\n\nIn his visit to the United Nations General Assembly this week, Ruto met with U.S. State Department officials and pitched for increased business between the two nations.\n\n\"The new government is signaling pushing for greater trade with the U.S., with President Ruto meeting with the U.S. trade officials this week,\" Muikia said. \"Most excitingly in tech, where Kenya's Silicon Savannah is excelling now, a market like the U.S. will open up business for Kenya and the region.\"\n\nKenya is among African nations benefiting from a U.S. shift in foreign policy as it scales up its presence on the continent. The U.S. trade office said the two countries are developing a road map of engagement in agriculture, digital trade, customs procedure and other areas.",
    "Uganda, Kinshasa extend military operation in eastern DR Congo": "By JONATHAN KAMOGA More by this Author\n\nUganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo have announced an extension of their joint military cooperation that saw the two countries’ armies launch an offensive against the Allied Democratic Forces rebels holed up in eastern DRC.\n\nAccording to a statement from the Uganda People’s Defence Forces (UPDF), the extension was signed Thursday by the defence ministers of both countries in the DRC capital of Kinshasa.\n\n“Uganda and DRC jointly extend operations in eastern DRC following a joint ministerial review meeting of ministers of Defence of both countries in Kinshasa. The ministers also approved Standard Operating Procedures for handling ADF combatants who defect or surrender,” the statement reads in part.\n\nAccording to UPDF deputy spokesperson Col Deo Akiiki, the new extension will span two months as have the previous ones since the start of the operation.\n\n“The ongoing operations are normally reviewed after every two months by CDFs who then make recommendations to ministers of Defence,” he said.\n\nThe statement adds that the ministers reviewed the current situation in eastern DRC and ongoing joint operation code named Shuja, following the third meeting of Chiefs of Defence Forces that happened recently in Kampala.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUganda’s technical team was led by Maj Gen Dick Prit Olum, while FARDC was represented by Chief of General Staff Gen Célestin Mbala.\n\nIn November last year, the UPDF and their Congolese counterparts the Forces Armées de la République Démocratique du Congo (FARDC) launched a joint offensive against the ADF rebels.\n\nKampala sought Kinshasa’s permission to pursue the rebels, accusing them of orchestrating several assassinations of government officials, suicide bombings and recruiting of Ugandans to their ranks.\n\nThe ADF has been an anti-Uganda terrorist group since mid-1990s, but recently established links with the Islamic States of Syria and Iraq (ISIS).\n\nThe United Nations says the group is responsible for about 200 killings and displacement of 40,000 people in DRC from the 155 attacks they carried out in 2020 alone.\n\nThe joint operation is currently in its third phase, according to Maj Peter Mugisa, the spokesperson of the UPDF mountain brigade. This third phase involves chasing down fleeing insurgents who fled when officers of the joint military operation bombarded their hideouts.\n\nThis phase also includes securing communities, and recruiting and training local defence units that are left behind to thwart possible attacks from the rebels.\n\n“For the past one month, we have been pursuing these rebels to wherever they have been running and we are still doing exactly that,” Mugisa said.",
    "Uganda parliament considers organ transplant revolution": "The Ugandan Parliament is considering a bill that would make it possible for the first time to perform organ transplants in this East African country. A small revolution that would transform the lives of thousands of people waiting for surgery.\n\nIf the legislation is approved, Uganda will join African countries such as South Africa, Tunisia, and Kenya, which already have the regulations and health facilities in place to allow organ transplants to take place in their countries.\n\nIndia and Turkey are currently the most popular destinations for Ugandan kidney patients. Only close relatives are allowed to be donors and travel must be approved by the Uganda Medical Council - to avoid organ trafficking or people being forced to offer their organs.\n\nIf Parliament approves the new measure, the process should be simpler and the cost of surgery and recovery could be reduced to about $8,000 instead of $30,000 for a transplant abroad.\n\nProponents of the measure say Uganda needs special legislation to create a safe framework, subject to strict regulation, to ensure there is no abuse. Among them is Dr. Kharya, from the Centre for Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy in India. According to him, Uganda already has a good base in terms of a blood bank and laboratories.\n\nThe proposal calls for the creation of a national waiting list of organ recipients and the establishment of specialized transplant centers throughout the country. An operating theatre has already been set up at the main national hospital in Mulago, Kampala.\n\nOrgan banks will also be established for those who wish to donate, not just kidneys.",

    "Uganda condemns EU resolution slamming oil pipeline": "**Uganda slammed a resolution by the European Union’s Parliament calling for a halt to extractive activities in protected ecosystems in an oil pipeline project. The Deputy Speaker of the Ugandan National assembly slammed a \"deliberate misrepresentation of key facts\" in the resolution.\n\n**\n\nBy 2025, Uganda will have its oil coming out of the East Africa Crude Oil Pipeline as planned. The comments of leader Yoweri Museni reaffirmed his determination to have the project completed.\n\nHis reaction came Friday following a resolution by the European Union’s Parliament urging the international community \"to exert maximum pressure on Ugandan and Tanzanian authorities, as well as the project promoters and stakeholders,\" to stop oil activities around Lake Albert.\n\nUganda is estimated to have recoverable oil reserves of at least 1.4 billion barrels. In February, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation and TotalEnergies said that the total investment would be more than $10 billion. They have partnered with the Uganda National Oil Company, and the Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation\n\nThe national assembly issued a statement asserting Uganda’s sovereignty and condemning the EU parliament’s resolution. \"The resolution is based on misinformation and deliberate misrepresentation of key facts on environment and human rights protection. It represents the highest level on neo-colonialism and imperialism against the sovereignty of Uganda and Tanzania\", Thomas Tayebwa, the Deputy speaker of the assembly said.\n\nKampala says oil wealth can lift millions. When environmental Ngos like Friends of the Earth evaluated that over one hundred twenty thousand people will lose land to make way for the project.\n\nUnfair compensation\n\nCompensation was also an issue. If Ugandan civil society had already voiced that disclosed compensation was not fair, the resolution doubled down. Saying that some landowners \"had their homes destroyed to facilitate the construction of access roads or the processing plant, others have had all or part of their land requisitioned and have lost the free use of their properties and thus their means of subsistence, without prior payment of fair and adequate compensation; whereas the compensation paid is often far too low to allow farmers whose land has been expropriated to buy comparable land on which to continue farming [...]\". It, therefore, called for the authorities to \"compensate promptly, fairly, and adequately, as provided for in the Ugandan Constitution and as promised by the companies\" , \"those evicted or denied access to their land\" and \"people [who] lost property and land\".\n\nThe text also expressed its \"grave concern about the human rights violations in Uganda and Tanzania linked to investments in fossil-fuel projects, including the wrongful imprisonment of human rights defenders, the arbitrary suspension of NGOs, arbitrary prison sentences\".\n\nMuseveni said TotalEnergies had assured him that the pipeline — which would link oil fields in western Uganda to the Indian Ocean port of Tanga in Tanzania — would proceed but warned on Twitter that \"if the French energy group was to choose to listen to the EU Parliament, Uganda shall find another partner.\"",

This conflict involved up to nine African countries, including Uganda and Rwanda, which supported rebel groups in the mineral-rich east of the country.\n\nOn Monday, Uganda's Finance Ministry Spokesman, Apollo Munghinda, confirmed the news which had been announced by DRC's Justice Minister during a cabinet meeting Friday.\n\nThe UN's highest court, ruled in February this year that Uganda should pay its neighbor $225 million for loss of life, $40 million for damage to property and $60 million for damage to natural resources.\n\nThe money is to be paid in five instalments of $65 million, starting on September 1 this year and every September 1 for the following four years.\n\nKinshasa had initially demanded $11 billion but the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered Uganda to pay $325 million.",
    "Government of Uganda signs MOU for geothermal development": "Government of Uganda signs MOU for geothermal development\n\nKasese, Kaberole, Uganda (source: CleanSource Energy Partners)\n\nCarlo Cariaga 5 Sep 2022\n\nThe Government of Uganda has signed an MOU with ASKA Group for the development of a geothermal power project at Katwe-Kikorongo, Kasese District.\n\nThe Government of Uganda, represented by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development (MEMD), has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Canada-based ASKA Infrastructure Development (ASKA Group) for a potential geothermal power project in Katwe-Kikorongo, Kasese District. Work on this project is expected to proceed over the next 18 months and will be funded completely by the Canadian government and other international credit development agencies.\n\nKatwe-Kikorongo had already been previously recognized as one of the major potential geothermal areas in Western Uganda. Uganda has estimated geothermal resources of up to 1,500 MW from 24 areas in the Ugandan Rift System.\n\nMinister of State for Energy Hon. Okaasai Opolot pointed out the geothermal potential of Uganda particularly because of its location along the East Africa Rift Valley. This point was supported by ASKA Group President Kamaal Samji, who mentioned the presence of steam in the ground in places like Kasese.\n\nEnergy Ministry Permanent Secretary Eng. Irene Batebe noted that ASKA will be expected to conduct feasibility studies as part of the project. The work will also include securing the required licenses and permits. However, Batebe assured that the Ministry will help in supporting this process by providing all the necessary information or facilitating the authorization process if needed.\n\nDuring the meeting between ASKA Group and the Ministry, Okaasai mentioned that power generation companies in Uganda can now independently generate, transmit, and distribute power to the end-user. This makes investments in the country’s power sector attractive while also empowering the population who rely on power to have stable and sustainable livelihoods.\n\nThe project is also expected to generate jobs for Ugandans. East Africa Project Liaison Salim Janmohamed assured the Minister that there will only be a maximum of 10 experts involved in the project and the rest of the employees will be locally hired and trained to meet international standards.\n\n“As climate is changing, we need to take a proactive role to diversify to clean energy. The project will provide clean energy for Uganda,” said ASKA Group CEO Dinu Samji, further stating that the project is in line with the global transition towards clean energy.\n\nSource: Uganda Update",
    "Uganda rejects UN definition of abortion as a human right": "Uganda has joined several other African countries to oppose the contentious United Nations Human Rights Committee’s definition of abortion as a human right.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines abortion as termination of pregnancy prior to 20 weeks gestation.\n\nDr Jesca Nsungwa, the Commissioner for Maternal and Child Health at the Ministry of Health, told this publication yesterday that abortion in Uganda is illegal and that the country does not support UN definition of the act as a human right.\n\n“We don’t promote or support abortion in Uganda. We are pro-life and, therefore, we oppose that definition,” Dr Nsungwa said in telephone interview, “There are many things that are promoted as a human rights including homosexuality but we do not support them given our laws, culture and morals, “she added.\n\nInternational media reports indicate that a United Nations resolution defining abortion as a human right and advancing gender ideology was passed early this month, and was backed by majority of Western countries, but was rejected by others, especially from Africa.\n\nAccording to fsspx news, the resolution’s focus on abortion and gender ideology was criticised by 33 countries, mostly located in Africa.\n\nIt reported that among the 32 nations that joined Nigeria in supporting amendments to strike abortion and gender language from the resolution were Uganda, Cameroon, Ethiopia and Senegal. The Philippines, Nicaragua, Russia and a handful of Middle Eastern countries also joined the effort.\n\nSenegal’s representative condemned the inclusion of abortion as a method of family planning and argued that the word ‘gender’ should only refer to “social relations between men and women.”\n\nThe Deputy Speaker of Parliament, Mr Thomas Tayebwa, in April said that he would promote and protect human rights, including fighting abortion.\n\n“I promise the Parliament and the people of Uganda that I will do things that will give respect to God. Personally, I have values that I believe in. We must respect the lives of every individual including the unborn. I’m pro-life,” Mr Tayebwa emphasised.\n\nArticle 22 of the 1995 Constitution provides for the right to life and Article 22(2) clearly states that no one has the right to terminate an unborn child except if authorised by law.\n\nDr Nsungwa also said unsafe abortion is a vice that must be fought to save the lives of women and girls. According to the Ministry of Health, Uganda loses about 16 women and girls on a daily basis and complications arising from unsafe abortion account for about 22 percent of deaths.\n\nWHO abortion stand",
    "Uganda: Farmers switch to organic fertilizers as price of chemical hikes": "As is customary, Joseph Wagodoma is on his way to his patch of land in Kayunga, central Uganda. If the farmer and his wife are used to tending their bean garden, somehting has changed for the couple. In the past few months, the yhave switched to organic fertilizers. Like many food producers, they are hit by global shortage in crop fertilizers caused by sanctions on Russia, bad weather and cuts in export.\n\n\"What inspired me to turn to organic fertilizer was the price of chemical fertilizer, Wagodoma says. I had no other source of money to continue with it. The small harvests we were getting would only cater for basic household needs, so by the start of the planting season, you have no money for fertilizers to prepare your garden with.\"\n\nAbout 15 km away from Joseph's farm, workers are collecting a organic waste delivery in a Kampala warehouse. The Marula Proteen company spearheads the organic fertilizer initiative.\n\nThe company's CEO and founder Tommie Hooft explains how the process works: \"We shred all the waste we ferment it in drums and the fermentation makes the waste soft and then the soft waste is fed to our maggots for a period of 7 to 8 days. The maggots that eat it their enzymes consume it they are breaking down all the waste. and in the essence the larva poo is the fertilizer and it is similar to what happens in nature, in nature some thing dies and it rots and it gets eaten by maggots and then it goes into the soil, so that's the process we are mimicking.\"\n\nA rapidly scaling project\n\nWhen the idea of ProTeen was born in late 2017 in the brains of the CEO and his advisor Ludivine Berouard, they were preoccupied by the animal feed and sustainability challenges Ugandan farmers faced.\n\nThey discovered that \"poultry farmers [were] no longer able to access fishmeal, their primary source of poultry feed\" because of \"overfishing in Lake Victoria which [had led] to reduced availability, high cost and low quality of fishmeal\".\n\nAccording to Food and Agriculture Organization, Russia stood as the world’s top exporter of nitrogen fertilizers, the second leading supplier of potassium fertilizers and the third largest exporter of phosphorous fertilizers. The consequences of the Russia-Ukraine conflict have turned the tables and ProTeen's mission has become more necessary as ever.\n\n\"30 to 40 % of the total chemical fertilizer available isn't there anymore and Europe needs it, Brazil needs it, the U.S. needs it, Tommie Hooft says. It is going to places other than Uganda other than Africa. So in our case we don't just have the opportunity to sell organic fertilizer we also have an opportunity to teach farmers how to use organic and start managing their farms in a more organic way.\"\n\nMarula Proteen has also partenered with residents who farm the short-lived but fertile insect. The company provides farmers with 5-day-old larvae that they rear to generate their own fertilizers.\n\nMuhammad Magezi a worker with Marula Proteen, says since the introduction of the black soldier fly initiative, farming communities are rushing to adopt the method. \"We are receiving a lot of positive feedback from our farmers because in the beginning before the introduction of this technology they used to use synthetic fertilizers which are more expensive on market and BSF black soldier fly rearing provides a cheaper alternative\", Magezi reveals.\n\nMarula Proteen prides itseft of providing a clean and safe fertilizer which can improve the soil.\n\nLarvae farming programs exist in countries including Nigeria and Kenya.",

    "Nearly 100,000 refugee arrivals in Uganda face a silent emergency, enormous needs": "Refugees shown returning home to the Democratic Republic of the Congo from the Nyakabande transit centre in Kisoro, Uganda, where many remain to see how the situation unfolds. © UNHCR/Esther Ruth Mbabazi\n\nAmid surging humanitarian needs for 96,000 refugees who have fled to Uganda so far this year, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, and partners urgently require US$68 million for life-saving assistance and services.\n\nAs refugees from South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) continue to flee violence and seek safety in Uganda, the humanitarian response is being stretched to breaking point.\n\nIn an inter-agency appeal, being revised from April, which covered an initial period of three months, UNHCR and 41 partners – including six UN agencies, 25 international and 10 national non-governmental organizations – are seeking funds through the end of the year to support up to 150,000 refugees, as arrivals continue.\n\nAt the start of 2022, Uganda was already hosting over 1.5 million refugees, making it one of the most important refugee host countries in the world and the largest on the African continent.\n\nUganda is also a global leader in promoting peaceful coexistence and refugee settlement among host communities. Refugees are provided with plots of land for housing and cultivation. Refugees and host communities access the same health facilities, and their children attend schools together.\n\nImportant gains in refugee self-reliance and economic inclusion are now at risk due to severe underfunding for UNHCR's operations in the country.\n\nBy the end of August, UNHCR had received just 38 per cent of its 2022 funding requirement of US$343.4 million to respond to the needs of refugees in Uganda, as determined at the start of this year.\n\nThe funding gap has strained UNHCR's capacity to provide critical support, including basic humanitarian assistance, child protection services, civil registration, and livelihood opportunities.\n\nRefugees are seeing a sharp reduction in support for income-generating activities, including for agricultural inputs that are critical to cultivating allocated land.\n\nChildren, especially girls, face a high risk of dropping out of school as UNHCR will be unable to pay teachers’ salaries, and already crowded classrooms will increase in size. With no more funding to procure soap and hygiene kits for women and girls, their health and access to education will be negatively affected. UNHCR cannot afford to purchase new stocks of medicines for health centres, while progress in reducing child and maternal mortality will regress, and infant malnutrition will increase.\n\nUNHCR and its partners need urgent financial contributions to meet the urgent needs of new refugee arrivals in Uganda, to upgrade the reception capacity and basic infrastructure of refugee settlements and prioritize the relocation of refugees to more suitable facilities.\n\nKisoro, in southwest Uganda, has received most new arrivals from the DRC. At the Nyakabande transit centre, refugees – overwhelmingly women and children – face substandard and crowded conditions which expose them to risks, including gender-based violence.\n\nFor more information on this topic, please contact:",
    "Egypt determined to disrupt Ethiopia's ties with Uganda": "September 9, 2022\n\nA Ugandan delegation on Aug. 24 visited the site of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, the controversial dam that Ethiopia is building on the Blue Nile, a main tributary of the Nile River.\n\nMeanwhile, during the annual Nile Basin Council of Ministers Meeting held in Tanzania on Aug. 19, Ethiopia and Uganda called on Nile Basin countries to join the Cooperative Framework Agreement (CFA), also known as the Entebbe Agreement.\n\nAccording to a statement by the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry, “During the conference, Ethiopia and Uganda called on the Nile Basin countries that have yet to approve the CFA to join it in order for the Nile Basin Initiative to be upgraded to the Nile River Basin Commission.”\n\nThe statement added, “With the exception of Egypt, all participants in the Nile Basin Council of Ministers Meeting, which was held in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, agreed to work together to this end.”\n\nThe Nile Basin Initiative was established in 2000 in Tanzania with the aim of consolidating cooperation between the Nile Basin countries. But in June 2010, Cairo froze its membership after six member countries signed the CFA in the Ugandan city of Entebbe, which gave the upstream countries the right to build dams on the Nile without making arrangements with the downstream countries.\n\nBoth Egypt and Sudan had rejected the agreement signed in 2010 and in 2016, Egypt returned to the Nile Basin Initiative.\n\nUnder the CFA, the member states would work toward establishing a more permanent Nile River Basin Commission to replace the Nile Basin Initiative.\n\nAbbas Sharaki, professor of geology and water resources at Cairo University, told Al-Monitor, “Uganda and Ethiopia’s call to establish the Nile River Basin Commission is an attempt to mobilize the Nile Basin countries into a unified entity led by Addis Ababa.”\n\n“Addis Ababa is trying to mobilize the Nile Basin countries, namely the upstream countries, to show the world that these countries are united in their positions against Egypt in the GERD crisis,” he added.\n\nEgypt is working to break the alliance between those two countries through rapprochement with Uganda via cooperation on food security.\n\nOn Aug. 25, a Ugandan delegation headed by Minister of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries Kagyigyi Tumwebaze met with Egyptian Minister of Agriculture and Land Reclamation El Sayed el Quseir in Cairo. The two officials agreed to work together to improve Ugandan agricultural production, with Egypt supporting Uganda on modern irrigation techniques.\n\nEgypt has worked for years to dismantle the Ugandan-Ethiopian alliance by winning over Kampala. Cairo concluded a military intelligence cooperation agreement with Kampala in 2021 to combat terrorism and other crimes.\n\nEgyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi visited Uganda in December 2016. During his visit, he announced his country’s readiness to carry out more joint projects in Uganda.\n\nIn May 2018, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni visited Cairo, where he met with his Egyptian counterpart. The two countries signed several agreements, chief among them a contract between the Egyptian Ministry of Electricity and the Ugandan Ministry of Energy to establish a four-megawatt solar power plant in Uganda.\n\nAlso during Museveni’s visit, the Egyptian Industrial Development Authority and the Uganda Investment Authority signed a memorandum of understanding to establish and manage industrial zones and a memorandum of understanding for agricultural cooperation.\n\nEgypt is also handling road and infrastructure projects in Uganda through the Arab Contractors construction company, including the construction of the Balisa Kamenkuli Road, the Masaka-Bukakata Road, and the Baleisa Kumi Road, as well as the rehabilitation and expansion of the Kayunga Hospital.\n\nEgypt is also supporting Uganda in its efforts to develop its water resources through projects such as a flood-prevention project in the Kasese district of western Uganda and the construction of seven dams and the drilling of 75 wells in remote areas in Uganda.\n\nCairo's perceived efforts to dismantle the Ugandan-Ethiopian alliance have prompted Addis Ababa to take counter moves to consolidate cooperation with Kampala.\n\nDuring a meeting with Ugandan Defense Minister Vincent Bamulangaki Ssempijja on June 2, Ethiopia’s ambassador to Kampala, Alemtsehay Meseret, stressed her country’s interest in improving relations between the two countries.\n\nIn August 2021, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed visited Uganda and met with Museveni. The two discussed ways to increase bilateral cooperation in various fields.\n\nFormer Egyptian Minister of Irrigation Mohamed Nasr Allam told Al-Monitor, “Uganda's positions were historically supportive of Ethiopia, although Egypt is one of the countries that supported Uganda the most.”\n\nHe pointed out, “Through its rapprochement with Ethiopia, Uganda is blackmailing Egypt to obtain further aid and get more projects,” adding that Cairo must not sit \"idly by and [let] Uganda move toward further rapprochement with Ethiopia.”",

    "Unlocking press freedom in Uganda: What must be done": "In 2018, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) global press freedom index placed Uganda 125th out of 180 nations—a grim rank the country held for three consecutive years.\n\nBy 2022, the East African nation of more than 44 million people had nosedived seven places as practitioners in Uganda’s fourth pillar of democracy continued to be threatened with a record overt and covert forms of repression from State actors.\n\nNow, the nation’s status of independent journalism falls far away from RSF’s description of free press. RSF defines media freedom as “the effective possibility for journalists, as individuals and as groups, to select, produce and disseminate news and information in the public interest, independently from political, economic, legal and social interference, and without threats to their physical and mental safety.”\n\nReturn to democratic path\n\nWith Uganda’s media freedom shrinking, her journalism has found a grim position contrary to the suggestion of Marxist philosopher Antonio Gramsci, who postulates that “history teaches, but has no pupils.”\n\nIn this case, a pupil of Uganda’s media historiography, fourth-year journalism and communication student at Makerere University, Ms Belinda Birungi, is “extremely scared to go missing once admitted into media practice.”\n\n“I am fearful of police and army brutality. Besides, they’re many grey areas in our Constitution that can be used against you,” says the 22-year-old Ugandan.\n\nEndless crackdowns on media houses have subdued the likes of Ms Birungi to self-censorship.\n\n“Security forces have snatched our courage to present the wrongs of society… I mean the courage to write objectively,” said Ms Birungi, who was interning at the country’s leading independent newspaper, Daily Monitor, at the time of this publication.\n\nBetween coming to terms with a brutal state capture of the media and surviving, Ms Birungi “prefers other things to becoming part of over 40 journalists killed globally every year.”\n\nIn reply to Ms Birungi’s concerns, the head of postgraduate journalism studies at Uganda Christian University (UCU), Ms Annette Kezaabu, underscores that “harassment and criminal sanctions are dangerous to journalism.”\n\nShe adds that one way of dealing with this is to ensure “cases of journalists should be handled as civil wrongs like in most liberal societies.”\n\nAlthough enshrined under Articles 29 and 41 of the Ugandan Constitution, repeated violation of press freedoms, profoundly by security forces, has raised questions over what appears to be a crisis of legitimacy.\n\nBut Kezaabu, who also leads the Uganda Pornography Control Committee at the Ethics and Integrity Ministry, says “the laws in place are sufficient and don’t require a constitutional rewrite.”\n\n“We should use the laws to tighten where security has made inroads, but there are things that we don’t talk about that are maybe an error of compromised journalists,” she says, adding, “Journalists must abide by accepted ethos for their freedom’s sake.”\n\nKezaabu, however, admits that interpretation or application of the law against journalists may be one-sided to suit the wishes of its enforcers or the jury.\n\n“There’s need to return the country to a democratic path to safeguard human freedom, including the one of expression,” she urges.\n\nFurther, Kezaabu acknowledges that use of anti-terrorism laws and a litany of other decrees against free speech are a clear loop of claw-back clauses in the Constitution.\n\n“It is incumbent upon media houses and journalists to know when not to overstep their mandate to avoid clashing with authorities by, for instance, promoting nudity,” she advises.\n\nArriving at a similar argument, Aga Khan University School of Media and Communications graduate lecturer Alex Taremwa “believes without social responsibility to audiences, the media lose the values that make their duty to society important.”\n\nMr Taremwa argues that breaching the universally known media mandate and standards may instantly birth the horrors that have defined the industry in the eyes of individuals like Ms Birungi.\n\nNew business models\n\nOne of the other challenges press freedom in Uganda faces is that there are more than 200 radio stations and more than 30 televisions in Uganda. The number is impressive. At least superficially. Nearly 70 percent of these stations are, however, owned by either deep state or legislators, according to an African Centre for Media Excellence 2022 survey.\n\n“They control the broadcast narrative and that breaks journalism’s will to mirror society,” observes 2019 BBC Komla Dumar award-winning investigative journalist Solomon Sserwanja.\n\nTo evade the proprietor censorship oriented by political and commercial interests, Mr Sserwanja moots alternative business models to run media operations.\n\n“…for instance, media houses can go after full subscription and run away from advertisers whose commercial advertising interests may force media houses to filter serious stories,” he told this publication on September 6.\n\nFair pay for journalists\n\nThe ability for journalists to report freely is also hampered, for many reasons, by the poor pay journalists are given. In Uganda, pay cheques of journalists have steadied below $200 (about Shs760,000) per month amid lack of newsroom investment by media moguls.\n\nAt least each senior editor contacted from five different (both) state and private media houses reasons that “equipping reporters is an essentiality for free press in a digital evolution.”\n\nFor 25-year-old Soft Power News journalist and digital assistant Muhamadi Byemboijana, “press freedom starts internally with employers ensuring fair pay for journalists.”\n\nHe adds: “Some press corps are battered because the tormentors have no respect for their low paying profession.”\n\nIn addition to that, because of the poor pay, many journalists will take bribes to manage the cost of living. A Ugandan journalist, who preferred anonymity, on September 7 confessed to accepting a “small bribe to kill a story.”\n\n“I killed a match fixing story involving the national cricket team because I felt unprotected, including by the media house I work for. Eventually, I accepted pay from the sports fixers,” the television sports scribe said in an interview.\n\nThis is why fair pay, although it might be a difficult subject to talk about, must be looked into to allow journalists do their work well. Mr Taremwa, in agreement of this, states that “like any other [human] right, good pay definitely increases the quality of freedom-enjoyment and eliminates the threat of bribery or blackmail, which endangers one’s journalistic autonomy.”\n\nCivic engagement\n\nAnother challenge to press freedom is the fact that the audiences for whom they write may not be critically aware of the role of the media.\n\nOver the last two decades, several media houses have emerged in almost all Ugandan regions—usually with screaming headlines critical of the State, signalling the possibility that media freedom has made some gains to be preserved.\n\nHowever, by 2013, an absolute militaristic approach under the Museveni presidency had outpaced his classical conservative National Resistance Army (NRA) post-guerilla war promise of a “free press” in 1986.\n\n“The public cannot say it enjoys freedom if information is being hidden from them. To move our press freedom higher than like 65 percent, awareness should be created in the public domain regarding the fundamental importance of journalism,” Kezaabu says.\n\nTo protect what he describes as his endangered freedom on duty, Mbale City-based Step FM talk show host Eric Mwasame, 30, wants “journalism recognised as a fundamental pillar of development.”\n\n“Society, especially politicians, take us as people who fight governments or mere antagonists, which is untrue. That should change,” Mr Mwasame says.\n\nSimilarly, Kampala City resident Peninah Rukundo singles out “civic engagement as a crucial enabler of free speech.”\n\nWhile the challenges to press freedom remain, some of these solutions can begin to pave the way for a media that is able to do its job robustly, which in turn provides the nation a good service.\n\nForming associations\n\nFor many professions, associations help push their agenda and enable them to have a listening ear from the powers that be. In the case of the media, however, a tiny sliver of Uganda’s hundreds of journalists subscribe to press associations that largely exist only in name in a complex political environment. This has discouraged many from joining them.\n\n“I want to know what these associations are doing for journalism by their actions and then I’d join them,” freelance journalist Daniel Emukule, 39, reacts when asked why he’s not conformist to any press association.\n\nWorryingly also, the near absence of Fourth Estate unions—as tens of journalists are continuously persecuted—has compelled at least eight out of 10 reporters interviewed by this newspaper on September 7 to describe existing press associations as “state-linked and inoperative.”\n\nForming strong and respected media unions and, or associations would, therefore, provide much needed support.\n\n“In areas where relative press freedom exists, working associations are vocal against injustices targeting journalists and that’s why vibrant ones are essential for press freedom,” the head of postgraduate journalism studies at Uganda Christian University (UCU), Ms Annette Kezaabu, emphasises.\n\nMr Sserwanja, 35, who left his job at a top media house in Uganda to become chief executive officer at the African Institute for Investigative Journalism (AIIJ), holds that the country needs more such establishments that protect threatened media practitioners.\n\n“All of us (stakeholders) have a role to play to better journalism in this country. The future of journalism relies on collaborations by entities that lead conversations against media repression,” he says.",
    "‘I watch people for signs’: the project finding and treating Uganda’s diabetic children": "On a night bus out of Kampala, the Ugandan capital, a 12-year-old child was constantly asking her uncle for water. She drank so much that finally she wet herself. Dankan Onzima, on his way home from a conference, was sitting behind the girl.\n\n“I felt bad and touched with what was happening to her,” Onzima says. “I had to wait until my destination, but they were going beyond my stop, so I asked the driver to give me two minutes to talk to the caretaker of the child and the driver allowed.”\n\nHe asked the girl’s uncle to take her to the diabetes clinic at Arua regional referral hospital, in northern Uganda, where Onzima works as a “warrior coordinator”, helping children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) – or warriors, as the hospital refers to them – get treatment and learn to use an insulin pen.\n\nQuick Guide A common condition Show The human toll of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is huge and rising. These illnesses end the lives of approximately 41 million of the 56 million people who die every year – and three quarters of them are in the developing world. NCDs are simply that; unlike, say, a virus, you can’t catch them. Instead, they are caused by a combination of genetic, physiological, environmental and behavioural factors. The main types are cancers, chronic respiratory illnesses, diabetes and cardiovascular disease – heart attacks and stroke. Approximately 80% are preventable, and all are on the rise, spreading inexorably around the world as ageing populations and lifestyles pushed by economic growth and urbanisation make being unhealthy a global phenomenon. NCDs, once seen as illnesses of the wealthy, now have a grip on the poor. Disease, disability and death are perfectly designed to create and widen inequality – and being poor makes it less likely you will be diagnosed accurately or treated. Investment in tackling these common and chronic conditions that kill 71% of us is incredibly low, while the cost to families, economies and communities is staggeringly high. In low-income countries NCDs – typically slow and debilitating illnesses – are seeing a fraction of the money needed being invested or donated. Attention remains focused on the threats from communicable diseases, yet cancer death rates have long sped past the death toll from malaria, TB and HIV/Aids combined. 'A common condition' is a new Guardian series reporting on NCDs in the developing world: their prevalence, the solutions, the causes and consequences, telling the stories of people living with these illnesses. Tracy McVeigh, editor Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.\n\nAs Onzima suspected, the girl had T1D and is now receiving free insulin and has a glucometer to keep track of her blood glucose levels.\n\n“Now I am happy that the child is under treatment,” says Onzima. “I closely monitor people around me for any ignored signs and symptoms of T1D.”\n\nOnzima, 24, was diagnosed at the Arua clinic in 2015 – a day he calls “the happiest moment of my life” – after months of not understanding what was wrong. At one point, typhoid and malaria were suspected. It left him feeling “lost, alone and scared, urinating all the time, scared to be outside my house just in case I urinate on myself, losing weight”.\n\nAlthough Onzima now has to carry a glucometer and insulin flex pen, the treatment meant he could pursue his education – he is now in his final year at Uganda’s Muni University.\n\nNurse Jeofrey Ojilong with a young patient at a camp in Lira, Uganda.

The foundation uses Uganda’s network of motorcycle taxis, or boda-bodas, to deliver insulin and other supplies to patients in the most remote areas.\n\nThe Covid pandemic and lockdown exacerbated the vulnerabilities of low-income children with T1D, making it impossible for some to access medication.\n\n“In Uganda, the lockdown comprised of a public transportation ban and a 2pm curfew for cargo deliveries. Uganda [had] the world’s longest school lockdown and some of the most stringent Covid restrictions,” says Vivian Nabeta, SNF’s founder.\n\n“In normal circumstances, children from low-income households face difficulties accessing essential supplies from their healthcare centres. Our data has revealed that children sometimes travel up to 5.5 hours round trip to get to and from the clinic for essential supplies, with the major part of the trip on foot.”\n\nOnzima said the use of boda-bodas has bridged the distribution gap, and transformed “how the warriors manage their sugar levels”.\n\n“With home visits, we get to see the warrior in his or her home, see the food he or she eats, see the family and understand better how the warrior is living and how we can help,” he says.\n\nWarrior coordinators Dankan Onzima and Mustapha Abdallah at the diabetes clinic in Arua. Photograph: Sonia Nabeta Foundation\n\nThe SNF was set up in 2016 after Nabeta’s sister, Sonia, died due to hypoglycemia, a T1D complication. Initially, she began organising four-day peer-to-peer education camps, and helped with scholarships for primary school students, before launching the boda-boda project last year, reaching 2,000 children.\n\nMore than 420 million people across the globe have diabetes, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, according to the World Heath Organization. A chronic and metabolic disease characterised by elevated levels of blood sugar, diabetes is responsible for about 1.5 million global deaths a year.\n\nType 2 diabetes, the most prevalent form, is often linked to lifestyle choices, whileT1D is a genetic condition often developed during childhood in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin by itself.\n\n“In Africa, children with T1D face suboptimal outcomes and premature deaths due to a variety of reasons, including lack of access to essential medical supplies and – perhaps most importantly – the failure to address the social determinants of health, including factors like poverty, psychosocial barriers, education,” Nabeta says. Only four paediatric endocrinologists operate across Uganda.\n\n“Our work has illustrated that it is not enough to provide insulin, syringes and a glucometer if the child is surrounded by abject poverty, food insecurity, illiteracy and other barriers towards good clinical outcomes. It has illustrated that addressing the social determinants of health and psychosocial barriers is paramount,” says Nabeta.\n\nShe said children have died from a hypoglycemic attack simply because families did not have any sugary item at home to stop it, while in other households distrust over modern medication has to be overcome.\n\nOne 17-year-old died, despite being on the SNF programme, because his family took his insulin away, resorting to “traditional medicine or going off to prayer crusades hoping the child will be healed”.\n\nProssy Lanyero, a teenage T1D patient at Lacor hospital clinic in Gulu, gets drugs through the boda-boda project. “Transport used to be a very big problem because I am a good distance away from the clinic,” she says.\n\n“I used to have a hard time following my appointment date. I used to ask the nurse to give me insulin for two or three months, but it would go bad because I have no refrigerator to properly store the insulin. I would use the bad insulin anyway because of transport problems,” she says.\n\n“In the past my family used to carry most of the burden of my care and I would feel bad but I feel that some of the weight has been lifted so now they can focus on my other needs too.”\n\nLucy Akwero, the mother of a 14-year-old T1D patient in Amuru, says her family struggled to find money for hospital travel – and her son even stopped going to school because it.\n\n“We were always anxious and worried, and my son was sad and hopeless,” she says. “Sometimes I would even sell our own food when it is approaching my son’s clinic appointment day. We do not have to worry about clinic appointments any more, my son now speaks good English, he is confident and happy.”\n\nSign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:",

Twelve participants from the Field,\n\nArea, and Country Offices attended the training.\n\n• The training helped strengthening their capacity by giving them foundational guidance on PSEA and gender-based violence and assisting them in reviewing their terms of reference to understand roles and responsibilities.\n\nAgriculture and Market Support (AMS)\n\n• Agriculture and Market Support (AMS) and Supply Chain (SC) together with a team from the Regional Office Nairobi and Head Quarters carried out a price transmission study to determine the factors behind prevailing bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and imbalances that prevent smallholder farmers and other actors from benefiting from local and regional food procurement. The following ten districts participated in the study: Kampala, Mubende, Mityana,\n\nKamwenge, Kikuube, Kiryandongo, Kitagwenda, Kyegegwa,\n\nKyenjojo, and Masindi. Results from the study will guide the implementation of the Local and Regional Food Policy and the introduction of the traceability tool.\n\n• AMS continued to build the capacity of the smallholder farmers, both refugees, and nationals, to transform their groups into agri-businesses. The focus here is on supporting the development of farmers' business plans, linking them to buyers as well as food safety and quality, and taking advantage of the various emerging markets in the country.\n\nStrengthening national capacity for Emergency Preparedness and Response\n\n• In July 2022, WFP partnered with Excel Hort – a consultant Agribusiness Incubator to support the establishment of two incubation hubs in Southwestern Uganda. These hubs are expected to foster job creation as well as food and income security especially for women and youth among refugees and host communities in refugee hosting districts.\n\n• Relatedly, 52 persons with special needs and the elderly received various kinds of livestock (chickens, goats, sheep, and rabbits) to enhance their food and income security.\n\nStaff from the Kikuube District Local Government (DLG) visited the Excel Hort Agribusiness incubation centre as part of a learning expedition to expand their knowledge of livelihoods and resilience building.",
    "Access to Clean Energy for refugees Uganda Case Studies - Uganda": "INTRODUCTION\n\nProvision of clean and affordable energy is a catalyst for sustainable development in all countries of the world. Access to energy increases safety, improves the provision of health services, enhances access to education and economic opportunities.\n\nRefugees worldwide face great challenges accessing energy. But innovative interventions by the humanitarian sector, together with affected communities, host governments, UN country teams, and a wide range of partners from various sectors, can improve access to energy.\n\nUNHCR’s Global Strategy for Sustainable Energy 2019- 2025 aims to enable refugees, hosts communities and other persons of concern to meet their energy needs in a safe and sustainable manner, while also addressing health, protection and environmental concerns rising from access to energy. In line with the existing framework, UNHCR has adopted the World Health Organization (WHO) definition of clean energy based on the impact on health. Fuel and technologies are considered clean only if they achieve WHO targets for particle matter (PM) and carbon monoxide (CO) emission. In addition, UNHCR defines the use of biomass in combination with improved technologies while moving as a transitional solution while moving towards more sustainable and cleaner practices.\n\nThe UNHCR energy strategy is part of the actions and parameters set in the Operational strategy for climate resilience and environmental sustainability 2022-2025, to respond to the growing global climate emergency. Guided by the Strategic Framework for Climate Action (SFCA), UNHCR focuses on mitigating the impact of cli- mate change and environmental degradation on forcibly displaced people and their host communities, sup- porting sustainability by preserving and rehabilitating the natural environment in displacement settings and minimizing the environmental footprint of humanitarian assistance.\n\nThis report presents case studies of clean and transitional energy interventions in refugee settlements implemented by UNHCR and partners in Uganda. Energy-related approaches from these case studies can be adapted and replicated in other refugee-hosting countries, as a means of meeting basic needs of people in displacement, improving their well-being and, when possible, creating sustainable livelihood opportunities through the provision of energy. The following case studies are based on experiences in refugee situations but can be adapted to internal displacement situations as well.\n\nInnovative interventions [...] can transform the lives of those who've been forcibly displaced, helping them to build better futures for themselves and their families.",

The orphanage will provide Ugandan orphans with a secure learning environment and cozy accommodation.\n\nSpeaking at the inauguration ceremony, Turkish Ambassador to Uganda Fikret Kerem Alp said: \"Türkiye displays true brotherhood in good and bad times. The Turkish government has identified child welfare as one of the areas where we can help. (Türkiye's) Maarif Foundation visited Uganda and held talks with the government on the provision of education services to Uganda. We hope this will be achieved.\"\n\nThe orphanage center includes classroom blocks, an administrative center, an assembly and exhibition building, play fields, parks, a large green space and a mosque. \"This Orphanage is proof that Türkiye cares for and treats the suffering and disadvantaged people in Uganda, particularly the children, who are often left to go on the streets when their parents die,\" Sheikh Abdallah Ssemambo, Uganda's deputy grand mufti (Muslim cleric) said. Ssemambo conveyed his gratitude to TIKA for carrying out projects in the country.\n\nFounded in January 1992 under the Foreign Ministry, the TIKA grew to be at the forefront of Türkiye's development aid efforts. In the three decades since its inception, TIKA has carried out more than 30,000 projects in 170 countries. The state-run aid agency's operations have covered a wide range of areas, from education to agriculture, to access to clean water and restorations. It has boosted its presence worldwide, from 12 offices in 2002 to 62 today, according to the agency.",

    "Uganda on alert as malaria cases and deaths rise": "By JONATHAN KAMOGA More by this Author\n\nA resurgence of malaria cases and deaths in Uganda is worrying the medical fraternity amid reported shortage of medicines.\n\nAccording to Jimmy Opigo, the programme manager for malaria control at the Ministry of Health, preliminary findings point to a drop in usage of mosquito nets, mutation of the malaria parasite and increase in drug resistance.\n\n“We are also studying whether Covid-19 could have had some impact,” Dr Opigo said.\n\nSome private and public hospitals in high risk districts are reporting an increase in the number of malaria patients seeking treatment in the facilities, health workers said.\n\n“Most of the inpatients at our facility are malaria patients although we have many outpatients coming in daily. Most of the drugs we have been stocking for the bigger part of this year are malaria drugs,” said Annet Nsole, a lab technician at Kasana Health Centre in Luweero district.\n\nAccording to August data from the Ministry of Health, about 46 districts across the country are currently experiencing a surge in the number of new malaria infections.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We have made some progress. We had over 70 districts, and we are now down to 40. But it’s still one third of the country, and that is really high,” Dr Opigo said.\n\nIn the last two weeks of August, the country registered 199,695 new cases with 35 deaths. Since the peak of the upsurge in January, the average number of bi-weekly new infections stood between 200,000 and 250,000.\n\nThis year’s figures are higher than last year’s average of between 100,000 and 120,000 new bi-weekly infections, Health ministry’s data shows.\n\nThe ministry has reported that about 23 percent of districts lack enough Artemisinin-based combination therapy stocks for treatment of patients.\n\nIncreased supplies\n\n“This is mostly because of logistical constraints. But currently as government, we are increasing supplies in terms of medicine and mosquito nets in high risk areas. In some others, we are spraying. We are now enhancing case investigation and running media campaigns to create awareness within the population,” Dr Opigo said.\n\nBut most of these interventions have been constrained by limited funds.\n\nAccording to Dr Opigo, the Health ministry spends about $140 million annually in the fight against malaria but the current upsurge has created a funding gap. Recently, the ministry secured $14 million from the Global Fund to help them finance the current upsurge, but officials say more funding is still needed.\n\n“We run long-term grants of about three to four years so what we did was to call forward the money for 2023 to help us increase medicine supply mostly. We are sourcing for more so we can be able to fill the gaps created by the increasing consumption arising from the upsurge,” Dr Opigo said.",
    "“The rich are untouchable”: Uganda’s struggles to protect its wetlands": "As communities and small businesses are cleared from environmentally precious zones, big companies expand unabated.\n\nLast week, state officials accompanied by security forces swept through the Lubigi wetlands on the outskirts of Kampala in a long-awaited operation. They made numerous arrests, evicted hundreds of people, and destroyed markets, lorry parks, and many other structures.\n\nThe action followed repeated presidential directives to remove people from the country’s wetlands. As businesses, farms and homes have increasingly encroached on these environmentally precious zones, they have gone from covering 15.5% of Uganda’s land in 1994 to 8.4% in 2019. If factors remain constant, scientists predict they could cover just 1% of Uganda by 2040.\n\nThe government’s plans to clear the wetlands have ramped up recently. The National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) has carried out crackdowns and reissued its previous calls for people to vacate lakeshores, riverbanks, forest reserves and wetlands. And last month, President Yoweri Museveni renewed his public criticism of companies situated on protected lands.\n\n“By interfering with the forests and wetlands in Uganda, we are interfering with the rainfall,” he said. “I am fighting to make sure that nobody cultivates in the wetlands…How can we kill ourselves and commit suicide by attacking the wetlands?”\n\nAccording to officials like Amina Nanziri Lukanga, Resident City Commissioner for Kampala, the government has approached evictions in a fair manner.\n\n“We have been talking to people one-on-one as a group to make sure that people understand what the president is trying to say in saving these wetlands,” she says. “If there are any people who can’t understand and leave peacefully, then there’s nothing to do but just force them out.”\n\nBut many people who live or work on the wetlands have complained about NEMA’s conduct.\n\n“Removing us from this location wouldn’t be awful. However, the approach is not acceptable,” says Fred Sseguya Mivule, who ran a kiosk selling soft drinks in a taxi park in Lubigi. “They didn’t notify us to remove our properties. They simply arrived and began trashing everything. Some of us are operating these enterprises with bank loans.”\n\nJohn Gumumushade, a 42-year-old father of six, is similarly dismayed. He lives on Namiiro wetland, along the shores of Lake Victoria in Entebbe, where 5,000 people face eviction. Over many years, they have built houses, businesses, schools, and churches on the 1,000-hectare site.\n\n“When we started buying these plots, all authorities here including the so called NEMA were seeing us. No one stopped us,” says Gumumushade. “I pushed a wheelbarrow selling fruits as a hawker for seven years to acquire this plot but now it is being taken away from me without compensation.”\n\nAnother rule for the rich\n\nAnother aspect of the evictions adding insult to injury is the perception that NEMA is only targeting poor communities. It is not difficult to see why.\n\nAround the same time security forces were destroying markets and shops on Lubigi, two flower farms belonging to Uganda’s richest man, Sudhir Ruparelia, could be seen extending their reach into wetlands outside Kampala. “This farm started from a very small piece of land, but every day we see them expanding and the whole wetland is getting lost,” said Musa Kavuma, a neighbour and eyewitness. When asked by African Arguments whether the company had permits to utilise the area, farm manager Ravi Kumar declined to answer. “You don’t know how these things work and you have got wrong information,” he said.\n\nIn Entebbe municipality, Akright Projects, another business owned by one of Uganda’s richest men, Hamis Kuggundu, is similarly actively building on wetlands. The Ham Palm Villas complex is set to be a high-end 200-acre gated community replete with luxury homes, swimming pools, gyms, supermarkets and more. The company did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n“Despite the laws in place, encroachment on these areas has continued, mostly because the government and the institutions it has mandated continue to encourage this,” says environmental campaigner Bridget Ampurira.\n\nSome Ugandan officials deny that there is a discrepancy in how different encroachers on wetlands are treated. “We are not focusing on the poor people, and no one is above the law,” says Vincent Barugahare, commissioner at the Ministry of Water and Environment. “We are coming for them and it’s just a matter of time; we have not yet reached them.”\n\nHowever, other officials speak openly of finding it difficult to tackle wealthy companies. Jane Asiimwe Muhindo, Bushenyi Resident District Commissioner, says she has faced intimidation from “high-end” individuals including government officials when trying to tackle big businesses in western Uganda.\n\n“Although we are working hard to carry out the president’s directive on protecting wetlands, we are facing opposition from well-connected officials who are trying to undermine us,” she says. “When we visit the community, people complain that we have [overlooked] the wealthy residents, [but] as a result of our efforts to pursue [those rich residents], we end up becoming victims.”\n\nThe problem of enforcing environmental rules when dealing with rich companies in Uganda is long-standing. As early as 2010, a frustrated NEMA decided to name and shame scores of companies and individuals encroaching on wetlands. The hope was that it would push them to change their practices sooner than lengthy court battles, but it had little effect. Now, officials say their next strategy is to go straight to the president for guidance.\n\n“The biggest number of people destroying wetlands are the rich who have become untouchable,” says Beatrice Anywar, State Minister for the Environment. “We are going to deal with them differently. We compiled a list of those untouchable wealthy people and it is already at the office of the president who is going to advise us on how to engage them.”\n\nThis story was produced with the support of Internews’ Earth Journalism Network.",
    "Uganda to allow investors to stay in wetlands": "By DAILY MONITOR More by this Author\n\nUganda has ordered all its citizens to vacate wetlands and forest reserves but will allow investors who had set up factories to operate in the meantime because they were misled.\n\nFinance Minister Matia Kasaija said the government is allowing the investors to occupy the catchment areas because they could have been unaware they are protected areas.\n\n“If those [investors] were misled, they will be tolerated because they were not told from the word go, but those [locals] who went there [wetlands] having been warned are the ones we are targeting,” he said.\n\nHe made the remarks while unveiling the International University of East Africa as the venue for the upcoming East African Food security symposium and expo scheduled for October 14 to 16.\n\nThe government’s move against wetlands encroachment is due to pollution, which is taking a toll on Lake Victoria and other water bodies, Mr Kasaija said.\n\nIn July, the government removed rice on an estimated 30-acre wetland in Otuke District in northern Uganda to dissuade farmers from cultivating in catchment areas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresident Yoweri Museveni had ordered all encroachers out of wetlands in January..",
    "Tourism Experts Call for Repatriation of Uganda’s Artefacts": "The Uganda Tourism Association (UTA) has called for the establishment of a committee to lead the return of Ugandan artefacts from foreign museums.\n\nHerbert Byaruhanga, the President of UTA made the call on Tuesday, 30 August 2022, as he and association members appeared before the Committee on Tourism, Trade and Industries chaired by Hon. Mwine Mpaka.\n\nAccording to Byaruhanga, who was presenting on the Museums and Monuments Bill, 2022, several artefacts were taken from different archeological and historical sites by different entities like the British, and to date, these have never been returned.\n\nThe Museums and Monuments Bill seeks to repeal the outdated 1967 Historical Monument Act. It among other things seeks to provide for the development, management, and maintenance of museums and monuments and formalise, control, and protect tangible and intangible heritage and works of art collection.\n\nByaruhanga said that it was a great achievement for several countries including the DR Congo (DRC) that are returning their furtively taken or stolen items – and besought that the Ugandan authorities do the same.\n\nAUDIO: Mr Herbert Byaruhanga\n\n“We only have pictures in museums. The bill should start the process of bringing these artefacts back. We need to constitute a committee to survey, investigate and bring back the artefacts that were taken from places like Bigo bya Mugenyi, Ntuusi, Bwogero, and Nshogezi among others,” he said.\n\nOn specific provisions of the bill, Byaruhanga proposes that the administration and management of museums or sites should be done at district, community, and supervised levels by a government department.\n\nHe is also against the proposal to have the tangible and intangible heritage managed by different ministries and departments.\n\n“The management of imbalu site is under the Ministry of Tourism, Wildlife and Antiquities and management of rituals is under the Ministry of Gender, this confusion will affect tourism promotion and development.” He said.\n\nByaruhanga said that every city or district should have a monument for instance the Bull in Mbarara and the Elephant in Gulu among others.\n\nHon. Hannington Musoke Wakayima the Nansana Municipality MP questioned whether it is not pricy to repatriate the artefacts.\n\n“It is expensive to maintain these artefacts when they are brought back, there are several items that were once returned and some of them are still in boxes, how can you help the committee to see how we can work on them despite these challenges?” he asked.\n\nHon. Ronald Afidra, the Lower Madi County MP said it is important for the association to begin by sharing the profile of the heritage that could have been taken away by colonialists. He says that as legislators, this will help them in the process of searching for the artefacts.\n\nAUDIO: Hon. Ronald Afidra\n\n“What are some of the heritage that has been taken by the colonialists? We know these things were taken but what is the profile of those artefacts?” he asked.\n\nFor only Bunyoro Kitara Kingdom, it is reported that over 300 artefacts were taken by the British including the traditional nine legged stool, a symbol of the throne.\n\nDistributed by APO Group on behalf of Parliament of the Republic of Uganda.",
    "Uganda medical workers strike at Ebola hospital": "At least 21 deaths are suspected to have been caused by the virus since last week\n\nMedical interns at Uganda’s Mubende hospital have gone on strike, accusing the government of not providing them with appropriate safety kit, risk allowances and health insurance.\n\nThe hospital, located some 150 km (95 miles) from the capital, Kampala, is hosting the main isolation centre for Ebola patients as the outbreak continues to spread in the central region.\n\nAll 34 interns, including doctors, pharmacists and nurses said in a statement that they would not return to work and want to be evacuated to a facility with safer working conditions.\n\nSix intern medical workers are said to have been exposed to the virus and are currently in isolation awaiting laboratory results.\n\nAuthorities say there have been at least 36 suspected Ebola cases, although not all have been confirmed.\n\nAt least 23 deaths are suspected to have been caused by the virus.\n\nAn outbreak of the Sudan strain of Ebola was declared in the country last week.\n\nThe first confirmed death was a 24-year-old-man, who lost six members of his family in the first two weeks of September.\n\nAvailable vaccines against the haemorrhage-inducing virus can’t be used in Uganda because they are only effective in dealing with the Zaire strain which was behind the 2013 – 2016 outbreak in West Africa.",
