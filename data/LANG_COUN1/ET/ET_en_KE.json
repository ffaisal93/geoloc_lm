    "Kenya's 'Marathon King' Inspires Runners After Beating World Record": "Kenyan marathon runner Eliud Kipchoge is spurring young athletes to follow in his footsteps after breaking his own world record Sunday in Berlin.\n\nCheers erupted from the crowd Sunday at Nairobi's Karura Forest as they watched Kipchoge race on TV. The watch party followed an amateur marathon organized by the Friends of Karura Forest to celebrate their 25th anniversary.\n\nKaranja Njoroge, a past chairman of the conservation group who serves on its board, called Kipchoge's win \"absolutely magnificent.\"\n\n\"Everybody went wild,\" Njoroge said of the crowd at the watch party. \"Seeing the guy was way ahead. Everybody felt so elated by the efforts of our king of athletics, Eliud Kipchoge.\"\n\nKipchoge's new record, 30 seconds faster than his previous world record set in Berlin in 2018, is now two hours, one minute and nine seconds. Njoroge called it an inspiration.\n\n\"I think it encourages people. Gives people hope. And even those who would never compete begin to believe, because this guy is 37 years old and he's breaking world records,\" Njoroge said.\n\nBarnabas Korir, an executive member of Athletics Kenya, the governing body for track and field sports, agreed.\n\n\"He's inspired the youth, but not only the youth but particularly all the athletes from Kenya,\" Korir said. \"You know Kipchoge is one of the few athletes who is completely determined. He's also very focused.\"\n\nKorir, who is also chairman of youth development at Athletics Kenya, said camps have been set up nationwide to encourage sports.\n\n\"We got the support from the government to do that and in the last 3 years, Eliud Kipchoge talk to the athletes when they were in the camps,\" Korir said. \"So, this is an opportunity for us now to give our athletes a symbol that they can do well if they remain focused, if they work hard.\"\n\nKipchoge has won 15 out of his 17 career marathons, including two Olympic gold medals.\n\nDaniel Schearf contributed to this report.\n\n",
    "Kenya: 11 people, including eight policemen, killed by cattle rustlers in the north": "At least 11 people, including eight police officers and a local chief, were killed on Saturday by cattle rustlers they were chasing in drought-stricken northern Kenya, Kenyan police said Sunday.\n\nCattle rustling or disputes over water sources or grazing land are common in the pastoral areas of northern Kenya, which border Ethiopia and South Sudan.\n\nThe Kenyan police denounced on Twitter a \"criminal and cowardly ambush by cattle rustlers against the public and police officers\" in Turkana County, which it said left 11 people dead: 8 police officers, 2 civilians and a local chief.\n\nThe police officers killed were in pursuit of members of the Pokot ethnic group who had attacked a village and fled with cattle.\n\nThe authorities announced that additional reinforcements would be sent to the area.\n\nIn November 2012, 42 police officers were killed in an unprecedented ambush in the north, in the Baragoi region.\n\nIn August 2019, also in the north, at least 12 people were killed by cattle rustlers suspected to be Ethiopians of Borana ethnicity.\n\nKenya, the economic powerhouse of East Africa, is experiencing a drought of unprecedented severity for 40 years, with hunger affecting at least 4 million of its more than 50 million people.\n\nFour consecutive seasons of insufficient rainfall have created the driest conditions since the early 1980s.\n\nRivers and wells have dried up, pastures have turned to dust, causing the death of more than 1.5 million livestock in Kenya alone.\n\nThe National Meteorological Organization has warned of a possible increase in \"human and human-wildlife conflicts\".\n\n-Hunt for cattle rustlers-\n\nKenya has launched an operation to arrest cattle rustlers who killed 11 people in an ambush on Saturday.\n\nKenya's police say the operation aims to arrest the perpetrators, recover the stolen animals and firearms and return normalcy to the area.\n\nIt urged people to offer information that may lead to the arrest of the gang and recovery of the stolen animals.",

    "What interactive maps and 3D digital models reveal about Mau Mau detention camps in Kenya": "In a new documentary released last month in the UK, Kenyan and British historians describe how Britain secretly used torture against prisoners in Mau Mau detention camps during the anti-colonial uprising movement in the 1950s. One of the Kenyans featured is historian and digital heritage scholar Chao Tayiana, the founder of the African Digital Heritage Project (ADHP), an organization focusing on the use of technology in preserving and sharing African heritage.\n\n“It really flipped the script as to who is uncivilized,” Tayiana says in the film, which reveals details from a secret archive known as the “Hanslope Disclosure” that remained hidden from public view for over 50 years. The archive contained damning evidence on Britain’s use of torture including murder, rape, and forced castrations against Mau Mau prisoners. Surviving veterans of this period are also featured in the film, and describe the appalling conditions they endured in detention.\n\n\n\n“Oral history is treated as second rate compared to written knowledge, and so it hasn’t mattered in many years that veterans and people who lived through this period have been saying that this happened,” Tayiana tells Quartz. “It was only until the disclosure of the archives proving that there was torture that people really started listening.”\n\n\n\nHistory of the Mau Mau uprising\n\nThe Mau Mau was an armed rebellion launched by the Kikuyu people demanding the return of stolen land from white British settlers as well as money for independence. The British declared a State of Emergency in 1952 to counter the uprising, with the executive order to put in detention camps anyone who opposed colonial rule. Unofficial figures estimate that tens of thousands of Kenyans were executed, tortured, or maimed during the crackdown, which lasted until 1960.\n\nHistorians estimate that more than 100 camps were set up during this period, yet remarkably little is known about their history in both Kenyan and British public spaces today.\n\nThe Mau Mau were eventually defeated, but the uprising is regarded as one of the most significant steps towards Kenyan independence in 1963.\n\nDigitizing Britain’s detention camps\n\nSince 2019, Tayiana has been working in collaboration with volunteers and colleagues in Kenya and the UK to document, digitally reconstruct, and curate an exhibition that sheds light on the Mau Mau detention camps that were built by the British in the early 1950s.\n\n“Visual language and imagery is very powerful in informing our understanding of the past but also helping us get a sense of where things are located in time and physically,” says Tayiana. “So [the ADHP] asks how this data can be communicated in multiple ways, through multiple mediums to audiences across the board.”\n\nThe ADHP works with museums, archives, and communities to document African histories through innovative technology that centers human experiences and oral histories. The project has so far created a number of open source digital assets including 3D digital models and interactive maps that show the detention camps were spread out all over the country, and included exile camps, detention camps, work camps and women and juvenile camps.\n\nThese digital reconstructions rely on extensive research and sources including oral and written testimonials, existing plans and 3D scans, as well as some physical remains from the campsites. The goal is to create a better representation of shared history and to make these assets more accessible to more people, regardless of their literacy levels or knowledge of English.\n\n“The biggest knowledge gap regarding that period is really around the human experience,” says Tayiana. “We are aware of the camps, we’re aware they existed, but we don’t really know much about what took place. The human experience is very abstracted from the nationalist story of how the Mau Mau fought and they got independence.”\n\nA ‘lifecycle’ between digital and physical work\n\nDespite the opportunities in using technology to reproduce cultural value and meaning, Tayiana says the ADHP faces limitations with resources and infrastructure to carry out its digitization efforts. Digital reach is also a factor, she says, as many target audiences in Kenya still do not have easy access to digital technologies.\n\n“We ended up reaching a very specific demographic, which is 18 to 34 year olds who are on Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook,” she said. “One of the things we think of is how can this primary audience then reach another secondary audience, so maybe their grandparents or their parents. We try to create a lifecycle between digital work and physical work, because I don’t believe they should be separate.”\n\nTayiana acknowledges that digital reconstructions will never be completely accurate, and she says remaining open to feedback and input is crucial. Next year, the team will begin incorporating more assets and cultural context to the map, beyond the epicenter of the violence in central Kenya. They are also currently working on a physical exhibition in Kenya about the approximately 800 concentrated villages that were set aside for around 1 million women and children during the Mau Mau uprising.\n\nThese villages were managed by British officials and ‘home guards’—armed non-Mau Mau Africans that were falsely branded ‘loyalists’ by colonial rulers. Tayiana says women and children were subject to cruel treatment including forced curfews, and they were not allowed to grow their own food or manage their own land resources.\n\n“The exhibition really centers on what that did to the societal fabric of these villages … and how the officials treated women.”\n\nTayiana says the exhibition will include the physical remains of a trench that was dug around the village, as well as the archives and oral histories collected from survivors.\n\nDocumenting history before it’s too late\n\nTayiana’s work with the ADHP is mirrored by her other initiatives that center human experience and value oral histories. In 2018, she founded the Museum of British Colonialism—a digital platform which facilitates global conversations on Britain’s colonial legacies. She is also the founder of the Open Restitution Africa project which gathers data on current restitution processes across the African continent.\n\nThere is a sense of urgency in much of her work to document these histories before it is too late. This is particularly true for the Mau Mau detention camps, as there are fewer veterans alive today to tell their stories.\n\n“This history is not being taught to the extent to which it should be taught in Kenya,” she said. “There are still a lot of wounds and silences here in the country regarding this period. But what’s interesting about this history, I think, is that there are so many factors that are working against it. And so the very fact that it did make its way to light…is something we really need to pay attention to.”",
    "Kenya frets about future trade with U.S.": "Kenya frets about future trade with U.S. Presented by\n\nQuick Fix\n\n— Kenya, the only African country engaged in bilateral trade talks with the United States, is worried about losing U.S. duty-free access for its apparel and other goods because the negotiations do not cover tariffs.\n\n— House lawmakers will introduce legislation today to suspend tariffs on base powder, an essential ingredient in infant formula, through Dec. 31 in a move supporters hope will spur domestic formula production and further alleviate the national shortage.\n\n— USTR on Friday outlined a short list of negotiating objectives for the trade pillar of the proposed Indo-Pacific Economic Framework agreement, just two weeks after all 14 participants agreed on joint goals.\n\nIt’s Monday, Sept. 26.

His Commerce Department, however, is continuing to pursue them – possibly to implement when the moratorium expires.

You’ll also receive daily policy news and other intelligence you need to act on the day’s biggest stories.\n\n\n\nDriving The Day\n\nKENYAN MANUFACTURERS WANT PERMANENT DUTY-FREE ACCESS: The Biden administration has been clear that none of its trade negotiations cover tariffs. That includes talks with the U.K., the EU and the Indo-Pacific region, as well as the Strategic Trade and Investment Partnership talks with Kenya.\n\nIn Kenya’s case, the country already has duty-free access to the United States for most of its goods under the African Growth and Opportunity Act. But the Biden administration has not said yet whether it supports renewal of that legislation, which expires in 2025.\n\nSo, in comments filed with the USTR, the Kenya Association of Manufacturers requested that duty-free access be continued, either as part of a bilateral trade agreement or through renewal of the nearly quarter century old AGOA program.\n\n“With unemployment and under employment challenges in Kenya at a record high, the contribution of AGOA to creating job opportunities cannot be underestimated,” the group said.\n\nThe Corporate Council on Africa, a U.S. business group, also urged continuation of Kenya’s duty-free access, noting the West African country is “the largest AGOA exporter of apparel to the U.S., totaling $449 million in 2021 and accounting for some 50,000 direct jobs.”\n\nBut it’s “important that we have an agreement with Kenya that establishes a broader economic partnership that goes beyond AGOA’s unilateral preferences and addresses more than just tariffs and goods market access,” the CCA added.\n\nAdditional areas should include digital trade and financial services, as well as provisions that promote deeper foreign investment and protect investors from unfair treatment, the group said.\n\nTrade activists at Public Citizen approached the market access question from the other side, arguing that it’s hard to see how a bilateral agreement with the United States would be better for Kenya than a simple renewal of the AGOA program since “history has shown that countries signing trade agreements with the United States have to make major anti-development concessions.”\n\nThe group urged USTR not to negotiate a traditional free trade agreement with Kenya because that would have “catastrophic policy and political repercussions.”\n\nFIRST IN MORNING TRADE: The Bulk Infant Formula to Retail Shelves Act is being proposed by members of the Ways and Means trade subcommittee, including Reps. Suzan DelBene (D-Wash.), Earl Blumenauer(D-Ore.), Drew Ferguson (R-Ga.), Dan Kildee (D-Mich.), John Larson (D-Conn.) and Adrian Smith (R-Neb.).\n\nIn July, those same lawmakers rallied broad bipartisan support for the Formula Act, a bill that temporarily lifted tariffs on imports of finished formula. U.S. formula companies lobbied heavily for base powder to be included in that earlier bill, but the provision was excluded amid concerns expressed by dairy producers.\n\nWhile shelves are better stocked today than over the summer, formula remains difficult for many families to come by. “The legislation I’m introducing today will build on that progress by helping increase domestic formula production,” DelBene said in a statement. “I’m hopeful that this bill can move with the same speed and bipartisan support that the previous legislation had.”\n\nG20 TRADE MINISTERS CLASH OVER RUSSIA: A meeting between trade ministers from the world’s leading economies in Bali, Indonesia, ended without a joint statement Friday after representatives disagreed over whether to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIndonesia was expected instead to issue “a chair’s statement” outlining the six priorities that lower level officials agreed on earlier in the week. Those include WTO reforms, a multilateral approach to industrialization, digital trade and the pandemic response, as well as the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nThe G-20 host issued a press release Friday that did not mention the minister’s failure to agree on a joint statement or include a link to a chair’s statement. G-20 finance ministers also failed to agree on a joint statement when they met in July.\n\nIndonesian softball: The European Union, which released its own readout of the gathering, said most countries agreed the conflict was the primary challenge for international trade and “condemned this gross violation of international law.”\n\nThe U.S., France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Britain objected to the statement produced by Indonesian Trade Minister Zulkifli Hasan since it didn’t include explicit condemnation of Russia, according to international media reports.\n\n\"Of the 27 paragraphs of the joint statement, 26 were agreed, one was not. The paragraph that was not agreed upon was about geopolitical issues. There was no consensus,\" Hasan was quoted as saying.\n\nAgriculture is next: G-20 agriculture ministers will be in Bali later this week to discuss global food security, efforts to boost sustainability and related concerns.\n\nTai heads to Japan: Tai will be in Tokyo Tuesday to attend former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s state funeral. The U.S. delegation is led by Vice President Kamala Harris, who also will visit South Korea on the trip.\n\n\n\nMENENDEZ HOLDS UP MCKALIP AG NOMINATION: Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) has placed a hold on the nomination of Doug McKalip to be USTR’s chief agricultural negotiator until he receives assurances the agency will establish procedures for greater congressional oversight and transparency of U.S. trade policy, a spokesperson for the senator confirmed after Inside U.S. Trade reported the action last week.\n\n“As [Menendez] awaits commitments and specific actions to this end, he opposes confirmation of this nominee as a way to send the clearest signal that he firmly believes Americans deserve honest and transparent trade policy that prioritizes the economic interests of the country and cracks down on waste, fraud, and abuse,” the spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nLong time coming: Menendez was one of six senators in May to sign a letter to Ambassador Katherine Tai that claimed the agency was not upholding its own transparency standards, and failed to properly consult Congress in dealings with the World Trade Organization involving intellectual property and Covid-19 vaccines.\n\nFarm groups impatient: Last week, a coalition of 105 agriculture and food associations and companies sent a letter to Senate leaders urging a swift floor vote on McKalip’s nomination. The Senate Finance Committee voted 27-0 in favor of advancing the long-time government employee’s nomination two weeks ago, with Menendez abstaining.\n\nA BRIEF GLIMPSE OF U.S. IPEF GOALS: A USTR spokesperson called the short outline of the agency’s negotiating objectives \"a vision document that is guiding our conversations with IPEF partners and stakeholders.\" It runs just slightly more than two pages, although USTR said it could be updated at a later date.\n\nIn May 2021, the Biden administration committed to following certain “Guidelines for Consultation and Engagement” developed by the Obama administration in 2015.\n\nThose guidelines say “at least 30 days before initiating negotiations for a trade agreement, USTR will publish a detailed and comprehensive summary of the specific objectives with respect to the negotiations and a description of how the agreement, if successfully concluded, will further those objectives and benefit the United States.”\n\nThe guidelines also say USTR will hold a public hearing on the negotiating objectives. However, a USTR spokesperson said those transparency commitments that Tai reaffirmed do not apply to IPEF since it is an “executive” agreement not subject to congressional approval.\n\n\n\nCANADIAN DAIRY WAITING GAME: It’s been about 120 days since USTR initiated a second dairy dispute with Canada after its first effort failed to force Ottawa to open its market as much as U.S. industry believes it should be under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\n\nBy now, USTR is within its rights to request another dispute settlement panel to hear its complaint since no deal to resolve the disagreement has been announced. However, a USTR spokesperson on Friday provided little information on that. “We’re engaged with Canada on next steps, in close coordination with stakeholders,” the spokesperson said.\n\nBecky Rasdall, vice president for trade policy and international affairs at the International Dairy Foods Association, said it has “been in communication with USTR about the substance of the second round of consultations and are working to support their efforts.”\n\nWhat’s next: Although timing is still uncertain, “we support proceeding with the second dispute when USTR is ready,” Rasdall said.\n\nARE YOU READY FOR SOME TRADE TALK? Unfortunately, we couldn’t get Hank Williams Jr. to kick off the WTO’s Public Forum this week, but I’ll try my best to pump you up about the annual gabfest. I mean, if four days of multi-room discussions on every conceivable trade topic is your idea of heaven, then Geneva is where you want to be this week.\n\nJust imagine being trapped in a building and every door you open is a different Washington International Trade Association event. It’ll be something like that. And to get the ball rolling, WTO Director General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala will sit down Tuesday with CNN’s Business Editor-at-Large Richard Quest for a scene-setting chat.\n\nFor anyone who forgot to book a flight to Switzerland, you can watch select events on the web.

    "On little strips of land, Kenyans grow everything from roses to azaleas to gardenias": "On little strips of land, Kenyans grow everything from roses to azaleas to gardenias\n\nAs he moves on from Africa to take up his next posting in Mexico, NPR's Eyder Peralta has one last love letter to a favorite part of Nairobi, Kenya: roadside plant nurseries.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nFor the past six years, NPR international correspondent Eyder Peralta has taken us all around the African continent. He's now moving on to report for NPR from Mexico. But before leaving his post in Nairobi, Kenya, Eyder wrote a love letter to one of his favorite parts of the city - the roadside plant nurseries.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF CARS HONKING)\n\nEYDER PERALTA, BYLINE: Nairobi tends to be a chaotic city.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SIREN)\n\nPERALTA: It's a sprawling metropolis, so the streets are a jumble - people, buses, police, goats, cows. On the side of the road, you can buy anything from a samosa to furniture to a puppy. But my favorite thing is that on the side of almost every street, you find a nursery. Hundreds, maybe thousands, of Kenyans commandeer little strips of land, and they grow everything from roses to azaleas to delicate gardenias.\n\nGEORGE JENGA: I'm George Jenga. When you translate Jenga, it comes George builder.\n\nPERALTA: Nearly 20 years ago, unable to get a job, George went into the forests of the outskirts of Nairobi and started collecting seeds. Since then, he's turned this bit of roadside into paradise. He walks me through his garden, a smile on his face. He has learned as much as he can about all of his plants.\n\nJENGA: Like, this one is called Podocarpus falcatus. This one is good for timber.\n\nPERALTA: He picks a hard, round seed.\n\nJENGA: This pod, it germinate within one year and eight months.\n\nPERALTA: Most of the plant sellers in Nairobi sell flowers. They grow quick, and it is what people want, but not George. What George loves are indigenous trees. So he waits years for a pod to turn into a seedling to turn into a tree.\n\nJENGA: Our generation is not for the trees. They are going after quick money. And quick money, you cannot get it while you are in a garden.\n\nPERALTA: George moves fast past his flowers. They're just not his thing. But about trees, he can talk for days.\n\nJENGA: This is Vitex keniensis. In English, it is called Meru oak. This one, it is called Calodendrum capense. The seed has a lot of oil.\n\nPERALTA: For wrinkles, he says. He keeps calling out names and uses. But as we move away from the road, his nursery becomes an oasis. We start hearing birds. He dodges bamboo, skips over rocks, and suddenly, we hit a stream. This is the source of life for his plants.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF WATER FLOWING)\n\nPERALTA: This is the most charming part of Nairobi, that in the middle of all the chaos, there is always beauty. It's a place where you discover that the aphids making your roses brown also attract hummingbirds, so you let them be.\n\nI can see why you like this.\n\nJENGA: You know, a wise scholar said when you treat the nature the well, the nature will reward you. I’ve been rewarded\n\nPERALTA: He's in good health. His kids have gone to school off these plants. And it's not lost on him that as Nairobi becomes a mega city and climate change ravages the Earth, at least hundreds of thousands of trees have passed through his hands. Sometimes, he says, he sees some of his seedlings around town.\n\nJENGA: I walk there. I see a tree. I laugh myself. This has come from my hand.\n\nPERALTA: (Laughter) So that's a good feeling.\n\nJENGA: Yes. I feel...\n\nPERALTA: Yeah.\n\nJENGA: Yes.\n\nPERALTA: Yeah. You're fulfilled.\n\nJENGA: Yes. I have done my part.\n\nPERALTA: He shakes his head. He didn't graduate high school, he tells me, but he has done his part. Eyder Peralta, NPR News, Nairobi.\n\nCopyright © 2022 NPR.

    "Kenya quashes order on compulsory use of SGR for cargo transport": "By ANTHONY KITIMO More by this Author\n\nTraders can now clear their cargo at the Port of Mombasa and choose the mode of transport to Nairobi and the hinterlands after Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) reverted custom services to the coastal city in line with a presidential decree.\n\nKPA has issued a notice to quash a 2018 notification banning the nomination of cargo to Mombasa and compulsory use of the standard gauge railway (SGR) for ferrying cargo.\n\n“This is, therefore, to notify all shipping lines that importers’ documentation of place of clearance and mode of transport for their goods shall be at their choice,” acting KPA Managing Director John Mwangemi said in the notice on Monday.\n\n“Shipping lines are hereby advised to facilitate importers’ nomination of place of clearance, including port clearance, Kenya Revenue Authority’s licensed container freight stations (CFSs) and KPA’s inland container depots (ICDs). This notice supersedes the notice of 6th June 2018 on similar subject,” KPA said.\n\nShippers’ take\n\nThe Shippers Council of Eastern Africa (SCEA) chief executive Gilbert Lagat said the notice has ended confusion on the implementation of the presidential directive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“This is very clear. We are happy with the directive. The place and choice of mode and place of clearance rest with the shipper. This is what we had been pushing for to allow cargo clearance and delivery to compete on efficiency, predictability and cost-effectiveness,” said Mr Lagat.\n\nHe added, “rail, road, port, CFSs and ICDs will compete on level ground. We expect the cost to respond to market dynamics as it is a win-win for all.”\n\nPresident William Ruto issued a directive a fortnight ago ordering that all cargo clearance be reverted to Mombasa port.\n\nCargo transporters had been protesting the directive by former President Uhuru Kenyatta to ferry their goods to Nairobi or Naivasha via the SGR for onward clearance, saying it had raised the cost of doing business, with the costs passed on to consumers.\n\nKenya Transport Association chairman Newton Wang’oo said SGR should compete with roads on an equal opportunity basis, which will ultimately lower the cost of transport and improve services.\n\n“This is a positive move. We have been fighting against forced railage. Let us looks out for the implementation of the directive on the ground,” said Mr Wang’oo.",

He argued that, as a consequence, countries of the Global South are calling for global governance to be more democratic and inclusive, as they attempt to get their economies back on track.\n\nBuilding Back Better, from the Bottom\n\nInvoking the oft-heard phrase “Build Back Better”, Mr. Ruto added a new clause, calling for the global economic recovery to take place from the bottom upwards, by including the marginalised working majority in the economic mainstream.\n\n“The bottom billion,” he said, “relentlessly wage their daily battle for survival in a a crowded arena characterised by scarcity of opportunity and a generally precarious existence.”\n\nHe went on to praise the “hustlers” who survive against overwhelming odds, and urged for action to bring them into the mainstream.\n\nReacting to drought and famine\n\nTurning to the climate crisis, Mr. Ruto noted that droughts and heat waves in Kenya, the scale of which has not been seen in decades, have forced the country to put more focus on famine relief, education support, social protection, and health systems. 3.1 million people in the country are food insecure, he said, as water becomes more scarce, and food prices rise.\n\nMr. Ruto recalled that the Stockholm+50 meeting, which commemorated the anniversary of the first UN conference on the human environment in 1972, was co-hosted by Kenya.\n\nThe Kenyan President noted that, at that international meeting, there was consensus from States on the need to act urgently in addressing environmental impacts, yet “little progress has been made in respect of the needful actions”.\n\nKenya, he said, is responding to the climate emergency by investing in climate-resilient agriculture, as part of a 10-year strategy for growth in the agricultural sector, which will “continue to hold the key to the creation of equitable and sustainable growth” for the Kenyan people.\n\nThis sector, as with others including education and health, is increasingly reliant on digital access and, said Mr. Ruto, offer a “viable shortcut to poverty reduction and the promotion of inclusive development”.\n\nThe President called for stronger global partnerships to enhance ICT (information and communication technology) infrastructure in developing countries, in order to bridge the digital divide between the Global South and the rest of the world.\n\nContinued commitment to UN agencies\n\nKenya is the host nation to the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the UN Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), and Mr. Ruto affirmed the “indispensable role” the agencies play in the promotion of environmental sustainability globally, and in developing socially and environmentally sound and sustainable cities.\n\nMr. Ruto announced that his Government has made more land available for the United Nations Office in Nairobi (UNON), to facilitate the upgrading of its complex.\n\nThe Ocean and Blue Economy, declared the President, remain a development priority for Kenya, in the belief that significantly increased investment can end hunger, reduce poverty, create jobs, and spur economic growth.\n\nHe reported that Kenya is reviewing its National Blue Economy Strategy to strengthen community structures – in participatory management of freshwater, coastal and marine resources, and ecosystems – and invited development partnerships to invest in Africa towards building capacity to sustainably utilise marine resources.\n\nWorking towards a national vision of the future\n\nOver the past decade, said Mr. Ruto, Kenya has implementing it’s National Vision 2030, a blueprint to transform the country into a “newly-industrialising, upper-middle-income country providing high quality of life to all its citizen in a clean and secure environment by 2030”.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic forced the Government, he said, to intervene in the economy in new ways, such as the implementation of an Economic Stimulus Programme, a Covid-19 Economic Recovery Strategy and a Covid-19 Social Economic re-engineering Recovery Strategy, all aimed at mitigating the adverse impacts of the pandemic.\n\nMr. Ruto went on to point out that support will be necessary from the international community, without which Kenya risks losing its development gains. He asked for additional liquidity and a better “fiscal space,” to enable Kenya to enhance social investment, support climate change adaptation and mitigation, address security needs and resolve development financing challenges.\n\nIn addition, the President joined other leaders in calling on multilateral lenders to extend pandemic-related debt relief to the worst hit counties, especially those affected by the devastating combination of conflict, climate change and COVID-19. He also urged the G20 group of leading economies to suspend or reschedule debt repayments by middle-income countries during the pandemic recovery period.\n\n‘Reform the Security Council’\n\nSpeaking as the leader of a country that is a non-permanent member of the Security Council, Mr. Ruto declared that Kenya has continued to champion closer cooperation between regional mechanisms and the Security Council as an effective means of achieving international peace and security.\n\n“We are committed to finding a stronger African voice in the Council”, he said, “and achieving a consensus driven, rule-based multilateral system.”\n\nHowever, he also noted that the Security Council needs to be reformed, to make it more democratic: “given the magnitude and variety of challenges the world continues to confront, a more fit-for-purpose United Nations is urgently needed, that possesses the legitimacy and efficacy in dealing with threats to international peace and security.”\n\nMr. Ruto went on to lament the failures of multilateralism, with regard to Africa, remarking that the last time that Africa was the focal point of strong and effective multilateral consensus was during the Berlin Conferences of 1884-1885 [which led to imperial European powers effectively divided up much of Africa between them].\n\n“We have an urgent moral duty to do better”, he continued, “and to right this wrong.”\n\nNevertheless, the President concluded that strengthening multilateralism is the only sustainable path to a peaceful, stable, and prosperous world for all.\n\n“This is the imperative of our time”, he declared, “and the call of this moment. It is time to work on the trust deficit with stronger conviction that none of us is really safe until all of us are safe”.\n\n",
    "US Overtakes Uganda in Buying Kenyan Goods": "New figures from Kenya's National Bureau of Statistics show the United States has overtaken Uganda as the largest buyer of Kenyan goods.\n\nThe numbers from Kenya's National Bureau of Statistics show that between January and June 2022, Kenya's exports to the United States totaled 38.8 billion Kenyan shillings — the equivalent of about $321 million.\n\nUganda's imports from Kenya dipped to about $300 million.\n\nAccording to the report, the jump was caused mainly by increased sales of Kenyan clothing apparel to the U.S.\n\nEconomists such as Ken Gichinga say the figures are a sign of Kenya’s deepening bilateral relationship with the U.S., including increased direct flights to New York.\n\n\"Americans have a bigger purchasing power for products in Kenya,\" Gichinga said. \"You find that American investors will find it a very good time to be able to purchase assets and buy things in Kenya because now, the market is in their favor.\"\n\nUganda has been the biggest buyer of Kenyan exports for over a decade. But a Kenyan publication, Business Daily, reports that Uganda's imports from Kenya have dropped as investors set up Ugandan factories to manufacture goods previously imported from Kenya, such as edible oils and cement.\n\nWangari Muikia, a Kenyan economist, said the country's strong relations with the U.S., backed by the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), will likely continue to thrive as the new government of President William Ruto is keen on more American partnerships.\n\nIn his visit to the United Nations General Assembly this week, Ruto met with U.S. State Department officials and pitched for increased business between the two nations.\n\n\"The new government is signaling pushing for greater trade with the U.S., with President Ruto meeting with the U.S. trade officials this week,\" Muikia said. \"Most excitingly in tech, where Kenya's Silicon Savannah is excelling now, a market like the U.S. will open up business for Kenya and the region.\"\n\nKenya is among African nations benefiting from a U.S. shift in foreign policy as it scales up its presence on the continent. The U.S. trade office said the two countries are developing a road map of engagement in agriculture, digital trade, customs procedure and other areas.",
    "Modest rate hikes seen for Nigeria, Kenya; Ghana to hold": "JOHANNESBURG, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Nigeria and Kenya are likely to hike interest rates by a modest 50 basis points in the coming days after months of heavy lifting from other African central banks to try to calm rampant inflation, a Reuters poll found, while Ghana will hold fire.\n\nThis week's benchmark interest rate decisions remain a very close call without any clear majority by analysts.\n\nA scarcity of dollars is fuelling inflation in Ghana and Nigeria, as well as other parts of the continent like Ethiopia, and all are still licking their wounds from waves of rate increases in the United States that have siphoned away greenbacks and weakened domestic currencies.\n\n\"Tightening global financial conditions and continued dollar appreciation will set the tone for upcoming sub-Saharan Africa central bank decisions,\" said Razia Khan at Standard Chartered, who expects action in both Nigeria and Kenya.\n\nFor Nigeria, a median of 10 analysts suggested rates would increase by 50 basis points (bps) to 14.5% on Tuesday. But while four respondents agreed with the median the rest were divided between no change and up to a 150 basis points lift.\n\nThe Central Bank of Kenya has been one of the least active in the continent in an election year that saw William Ruto sworn in as Kenya's fifth president. Rates were expected to be hiked for a second time by 50 bps on Thursday, taking them to 8.0%.\n\nBut again, the outcome was a close call with the breakdown of 11 analysts showing five predicted no change, four saw a hike of 50 bps and two expected a 100 bps increase.\n\nLike in South Africa, inflation has been high in Kenya although not as fast as in west Africa. South Africa increased its repo rate by 75 bps last week and similar hikes are expected in the next two quarters.\n\nA median of nine analysts said rates would be held at 22.0% in Ghana. Five respondents said no change while the others expected a lift of between 100 and 300 bps.\n\nThe Bank of Ghana has hiked rates by 850 bps in the past year but that has not helped stop a slide in its currency which has been one of the worst performing emerging market currency, having lost over half its value this year.\n\n\"We expect inflation to peak in Q4, before starting to recede, while the cedi has started to move sideways in recent weeks,\" said Pieter du Preez of Oxford Economics.\n\nConsumer inflation in Ghana raced to 33.9% in August, its highest since 2001 and in the same month as a 300 basis point hike in interest rates to 22.0%, the largest lending rate increase in the country's history.\n\nKhan said given Ghana's tightening was still feeding into the economy, \"we no longer expect further imminent rate changes\".\n\nGhana's central bank rescheduled its upcoming interest rate decision to Oct. 7 from Sept. 26 to coincide with the end of an International Monetary Fund mission to the country.",
    "Kenya’s Ruto: A chicken seller who rose to the presidency": "A chicken seller who became a successful businessman; a politician who rose to the presidency: William Ruto was officially declared president of Kenya after narrowly winning the election in August.\n\nWhile it is widely considered Africa’s most stable democracy, the country has its fair share of burdens.\n\nThis week, we discuss some of the challenges facing Kenya – from deep ethnic divisions to a flailing economy, the threat of armed groups and the worst drought in decades.\n\nThe Kenyan president, William Ruto, talks to Al Jazeera.",
    "Uhuru Kenyatta failed to turn Kenya into as big an international player as he could – here’s why": "One of the notable achievements of Uhuru Kenyatta’s nine-year tenure as president was that he invigorated Kenya’s foreign policy.\n\nA year after his 2013 inauguration, his government launched a document that outlined Kenya’s diplomatic engagements and foreign relations. It was the country’s first written foreign policy since independence.\n\nIts themes can be distilled into four objectives and practices: regional and continental cooperation; promoting Kenya’s economic interests; revival of pan-Africanism; and an aggressive approach to foreign policy, including a plethora of high-level visits.\n\nIt was indeed a dynamic performance.\n\nNevertheless, in my view, based on the country’s mixed outcomes and foreign policy losses, it’s evident that the Kenyatta government’s foreign policy was not focused, consistent or effectively coordinated. Consequently, it failed to create a regional balance of power favourable to Kenya’s interests.\n\nAnd while the country became more visible globally and actively engaged in international matters, the returns from this visibility have been dismal – save for an increased debt burden.\n\nRegional and continental cooperation\n\nIn the 2014 Kenya Foreign Policy document, Kenyatta affirmed that Kenya would seek to promote sub-regional and regional integration.\n\nIn his inauguration speech in 2013, he said his government would strengthen regional ties through the free movement of people, goods and investment. He underscored the importance of deepening relations with the East African Community and Africa as a whole to:\n\ndeliver on the promise of independence and liberation from our colonial past.\n\nHowever, critics faulted Kenyatta for using a pan-African approach to overcome the initial global isolation and non-receptiveness Kenya faced from traditional allies like Britain and the US. This chilly reception from the UK and US followed Kenyatta’s election as president despite his facing an International Criminal Court (ICC) case.\n\nAs a result, the president’s policy on global politics retracted to operating through the continental body, the African Union.\n\nKenya became an active contributor to the union’s programmes. In 2014, the country gave US$1.1 million to support the African World Heritage Fund.\n\nIn 2015, Kenyatta was elected the chairperson of the African Peer Review Mechanism. This is a voluntary assessment and monitoring system that evaluates and advises African Union member states on their progress in achieving good governance.\n\nMoreover, Kenya was among the countries that contributed troops to the African Union Mission in Somalia.\n\nDespite all this activity, Kenyatta failed to effectively exert influence and drive regional integration to Kenya’s advantage.\n\nPan-Africanism\n\nA notable element in Kenya’s foreign policy under Kenyatta was the renaissance of pan-Africanism. In his first address to the African Union Summit in 2013, he said:\n\nPan-Africanism has sparked a Kenyan renaissance.\n\nThe president said he had received tutelage on pan-Africanism from his father, Jomo Kenyatta, Kenya’s first president.\n\nArguably, this pan-African reinvigoration into Kenya’s foreign policy was motivated by the existential threats of global sanctions that the regime faced. Yet, Kenyatta’s election against the backdrop of the cases at The Hague turned Kenya into an icon of resistance following what was perceived as the unfair targeting of Africa by the ICC.\n\nDuring Kenyatta’s inauguration, Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni praised Kenyans for rejecting western neo-colonialism. This was in reference to calls by diplomats that Kenyans should not elect people with cases to answer at the ICC.\n\nThe African Union convened an extraordinary summit that declared support for Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto, who was also facing charges at The Hague.\n\nEconomic interests\n\nKenyatta’s foreign policy of economic prosperity was pursued and achieved via a triple approach.\n\nFirst was through encouraging trade ties with traditional allies like the UK, US and some countries in western Europe. Second was through a diversification of economic relations to include new markets in the form of a “look east” policy.\n\nThird was through emphasising intra-African trade. Kenya signed trade agreements with states not considered traditional allies, such as Nigeria and Ghana. Additionally, the country quickly signed the African Continental Free Trade Area agreement in March 2018.\n\nBut questions have arisen on whether Kenya has the financial capacity to meet present and future economic obligations.\n\nAssertive foreign policy\n\nKenya hosted a wide range of high-level international meetings. Subjects ranged from climate change to trade. Kenyatta also received high-level delegations reminiscent of former president Daniel Moi’s era. His guests included the pope and leaders of India, Israel, US, UK, China and Japan.\n\nFrom Africa, Kenyatta hosted leaders from Ghana, Ethiopia, Somalia, Uganda and Rwanda, among many others.\n\nBy July 2022, a month to the election that would end his term in office, Kenyatta had made 158 official foreign trips. In contrast, his predecessor Mwai Kibaki made just 33 foreign trips over 10 years of leadership.\n\nThe country’s foreign policy during Kenyatta’s second term, which began in 2017, is what I would describe as aggressive or assertive. The country took advantage of any international opportunity that arose to make its mark.\n\nIn February 2022, Kenya addressed a UN Security Council meeting on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Its envoy to the UN, Martin Kimani, came out strongly in defence of Ukraine. He stated that the Charter of the United Nations was fading due to “the relentless assault of the powerful”. Kimani compared Ukraine’s plight to Africa’s colonial legacy.\n\nKenya’s aggressive foreign policy direction earned Kenya a seat at the UN Security Council as a non-permanent member.\n\nBut this aggressive foreign policy also portrayed Kenya as a nation that “wants everything”. This earned it some opposition regionally. For instance, states like Uganda, Burundi, Djibouti and Tanzania didn’t vote for Kenya in its bid to chair the African Union Commission.\n\nKenyatta should have streamlined his priorities and made his foreign objectives sharper so as not to appear to be a “Jack of all trades” in foreign affairs. Many foreign interests were projected with little coordination; few were accomplished.\n\nIn some cases, the country’s goodwill was squandered in the pursuit of self-interest.\n\nWhat next?\n\nThe post-Kenyatta government needs to fast-track the realisation of East African Community objectives. It needs to support South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo’s active participation in regional integration. The new Ruto regime should also maintain a non-disruptive relationship with Rwanda and Tanzania.\n\nIn the Horn of Africa, Kenya needs to diplomatically endeavour to reduce Ethiopia’s growing influence in the leadership of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development.\n\nUnder Kenyatta, Kenya’s foreign policy practice within the African Union was more “lone ranger”. The Ruto regime will need to forge closer ties with regional powers like Egypt, Nigeria and South Africa to make it easier for Kenya to push through its agenda at the African Union.\n\nIt will also need to renegotiate its foreign debts and re-examine Kenya-China agreements to re-organise debt repayments.",
    "William Ruto: New Kenya president’s bold move to scrap subsidies": "\"It will depend on how many other things he does right. If the decisions will not lower the cost of living within the next six to eight months then the joy of the ordinary citizens will not last long,\" he said.",
    "A Triumph for Kenya’s Democracy": "After weeks of uncertainty, Kenya’s Supreme Court has unanimously upheld Deputy President William Ruto’s win in the 9 August presidential election. On 5 September, the judges rejected allegations of irregularities presented by lawyers for Raila Odinga, the long-time opposition figure who was runner-up to Ruto. They said Odinga had failed to support his claims of ballot stuffing and external interference with the tally, concluding that Ruto’s election was valid. The highly anticipated judgment capped a peaceful and transparent campaign that, despite shortcomings, represents a significant achievement in a country where violence has marred previous polls and where public trust in electoral institutions has historically been low. The decision also cemented the Kenyan judiciary’s role as an arbiter of electoral disputes and underscored its independence. Kenya should now build on this election’s high standard to further strengthen the electoral commission and bolster its credibility, so that electoral turmoil may become nothing but a distant memory. The presidential vote was a hard-fought contest involving three of Kenya’s political giants. It pitted Odinga, who was hoping to prevail after four unsuccessful previous attempts, against Ruto, making his first stab at the presidency. The third protagonist was outgoing President Uhuru Kenyatta, who, following a bitter falling-out with Ruto in 2018, had spurned his long-time ally to strongly support Odinga. That shuffling of political cards and the new alliances it brought meant that the outcome was especially unpredictable. Many were concerned that the electoral season could once again be turbulent, given the acrimony between the president and deputy president. A second worry was that the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) would not be up to the tasks of running smooth polls and ensuring a credible vote count. The body’s weaknesses had been on display in past elections. After the last vote in 2017, the Supreme Court had annulled the presidential poll and ordered a fresh election, arguing that “irregularities and illegalities” had compromised the vote’s integrity. Independent audits pointed out other deficiencies and suggested remedies that the commission, parliament and state have yet to apply. On top of these issues, this time around, the IEBC’s budget allocations were delayed and the electoral laws it needs to do its job properly were passed only weeks before voting, all while state authorities subjected it to various untoward pressures.\n\nBoth of the main presidential candidates mounted issue-based campaigns rather than trying to marshal support primarily along ethnic lines.\n\nAs it happened, there was little to fear on either count. Both the electioneering and the vote went off peacefully, with a few disturbing exceptions, in a welcome break from the past. One reason for the relative calm was likely that both of the main presidential candidates mounted issue-based campaigns rather than trying to marshal support primarily along ethnic lines, as their predecessors have often done. Unemployment and the rising cost of living – and the candidates’ ideas about how to tackle those problems – took centre stage during this electoral cycle. The elections were also much more transparent than previous ones. Final tallies showed a narrow victory for Ruto. He polled 50.49 per cent of the vote, while Odinga garnered 48.8 per cent. Observers from several outside institutions, including the African Union and the European Union, hailed the IEBC’s conduct in running the polls. In one measure that earned it plaudits – and boosted the count’s transparency – the IEBC uploaded the results forms from each of the 46,229 polling stations to an online portal for all to see. The process was not perfect, however. Following a mix-up of ballot materials, the IEBC postponed some local elections, including gubernatorial contests in Kakamega and Mombasa, two of the subnational units known as counties. These polls eventually took place on 29 August. Police also recorded a dozen security incidents related to the elections: an electoral official was shot and injured during an attack on a tallying centre in Wajir county in northern Kenya, forcing the commission to halt the count. Another IEBC official, Daniel Musyoka, was found strangled after having disappeared in the Embakasi East district of Nairobi. His murder is a particular blot: it remains unexplained, with no suspect identified. At Musyoka’s burial on 26 August, electoral commission Chairman Wafula Chebukati condemned the persistent attacks on commission staff, citing also the brief detention by police of several senior officials in the course of counting votes. Confusion marred the final presidential result declaration on 15 August, even though the IEBC had posted the results forms online and announced each constituency tally on television after verification by the rival presidential campaigns. As Chebukati was preparing to name Ruto the winner, Odinga allies at the national tallying centre tried to prevent him from doing so. A brawl erupted, though security forces swiftly restored order. At the same time, four of the seven IEBC commissioners – all recently appointed by Kenyatta – walked out of the tallying centre. They held a press conference questioning the results, notably accusing the IEBC chairman of sidelining them while the vote totals were compiled. The commissioners’ assertions were undermined by the fact that they had played a prominent role in relaying earlier provisional tallies on television, before staging their last-minute protest. Chebukati eventually announced the results, but the walkout cast a pall over the proceedings. The next day, Odinga officially rejected the final tally, citing the divisions among the IEBC commissioners as proof of malfeasance. He and several other individuals and NGOs filed petitions on 22 August, laying out a raft of claims against the electoral commission. In particular, they questioned the integrity of the technology used to identify voters and transmit results, and the probity of the foreign firm that supplied it. They also alleged that hackers had penetrated the IEBC’s servers and tampered with the forms uploaded on its portal. A key contention by the petitioners was that Ruto may not have won enough votes to hit the 50 per cent mark. The Kenyan constitution mandates a run-off if no candidate gets half the votes in the first round. Following days of televised proceedings that transfixed the country, the Supreme Court upheld the election. The seven judges led by Chief Justice Martha Koome dismissed all of Odinga’s complaints, arguing that his legal team had failed to provide sufficient evidence to call the election’s validity into question. Court-ordered scrutiny of the IEBC’s servers found no evidence of intrusion. A recount at 41 stations identified by the petitioners returned an exact match with official tallies, although it found minor errors, including missing signatures and misfiled forms. The court concluded that the IEBC had complied with laws demanding that elections be “simple, accurate, verifiable, secure, accountable and transparent”. The judges did, however, pinpoint areas where the IEBC could improve, highlighting the divisions and mistrust among commissioners, and urging the commission to follow through with the recommendations from past audits.\n\n[Raila] Odinga and his running mate, Martha Karua, indicated that they would respect the [Supreme Court's] decision, though they disagreed with it.",
    "DARIUS OKOLLA - The Myth That Is Plastic Waste Recycling in Kenya": "Brexit Britain’s dismal plan to export its “immigration problem” to Rwanda through the forced deportation of asylum seekers is in some ways redolent of how, more than a century earlier, Kenya Colony dealt with its “native question”. That centred upon how to control the “natives” in a white European colony.\n\nSome of the same buzzwords can be heard again this time around. Morality, betterment, economics, labour, containment, segregation and deterrence. Africans (and migrants of other ethnicities) must be contained in the equivalent of “native” reserves so that states can better control them. Moving them into reserves (aka migrant hostels, barracks, camps or detention centres) is for their own good. They will learn to give up whatever they were doing and labour for the white man (or in Rwanda’s case, industrious black and brown people). They will learn by example to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, as if they had never worked hard before. They will be mighty grateful for the opportunities offered – or they damn well ought to be. Saviours, of whatever colour, will save the lazy “natives” from themselves – or in the case of cross-Channel migrants, from people smugglers. Morally, it is the right thing to do. Civilisation will rub off on them. But whether the deported migrants will be treated as citizens or subjects in their new “home” remains unclear.\n\nWriting in The Times in April, the then Home Secretary Priti Patel, chief architect of the UK-Rwanda deportation scheme, said, “We can provide legal, safe, orderly and controlled ways for people to better their lives, flee oppression, persecution or conflict and enjoy new opportunities” (emphasis mine). This ignores the fact that forced deportation is itself oppressive, and a form of trafficking. The “best interests” argument was regularly used by colonial administrators, in Kenya and in other British colonies, to justify forced removals and other oppressive measures against Africans, such as the Maasai removals and the Talai resettlement (discussed below).\n\nContinuities in the colonial treatment of mobile Africans, and the modern-day treatment of refugees and asylum seekers (both African and other non-whites), are plain to see. Scholars Hanna Brankamp and Patricia Daley write of labourers, migrants and refugees, then and now: “Colonial biopolitics dictated that nonwhite bodies only move at the behest of capital, colonial authorities, and certainly never of their own volition”. Discussing both colonial migrant labourers and post-colonial refugees and migrants, and historical trajectories of migration control, their term “racialized subjects in need of spatial fixation” is a useful one. They draw parallels between measures of regulation, control and containment that are still in vogue today.\n\nThe role of Brexit\n\nThe goal of ending unfettered immigration to Britain lay at the heart of the Brexit vote in 2016, when a slim majority of British people voted to leave the European Union (EU). Those voters, known as Brexiteers, seem to forget that 47.5 million people did not vote to leave. Though this figure includes 13 million people who did not vote at all, those who voted to stay in the EU are called Remainers. The country formally left the EU in January 2020. But Brexiteers are furious that Brexit has not delivered what they expected, or were promised. In particular, they rage at what they see as out-of-control immigration, and the spectre of “hordes” of young men “of fighting age” from Africa and the Middle East arriving on our beaches. The majority are wrongly assumed to be Muslims, who are believed, in the wake of several terrorist attacks by young Muslim men living in Britain, to pose a terror threat. Immigration, especially by cross-Channel dinghy from France, aided by people smugglers, has soared under successive Tory governments; 28,500 migrants crossed the Channel this way in the past year, treble the figure for the previous 12 months. More than 20,000 people have crossed since the start of 2022. Crossings have continued since the Home Office announced its deportation plan, which indicates that it is not a deterrent. Some 1295 people crossed in one day (22 August), a record for 2022 so far. The fact that the migrants are escorted ashore by Border Force officials, housed in hotels, fed and watered, and “paid” £39 a week, all at taxpayers’ expense, only infuriates Brexiteers more.\n\n“Colonial biopolitics dictated that nonwhite bodies only move at the behest of capital, colonial authorities, and certainly never of their own volition”.\n\nGloating over this fiasco is the divisive figure of Nigel Farage, an éminence grise obsessed with immigration and the EU, who has never managed to get elected to the British parliament, despite seven attempts. He was, nonetheless, the driving force behind Brexit, when leader of the fringe UKIP (UK Independence Party) and Brexit Party. Farage continues to whip up anti-migrant sentiment on right-wing broadcast channels such as GB News, but also in the pages of serious national newspapers. If one person is single-handedly responsible for the anti-migrant rhetoric, it is Farage. Shamefully, the two final candidates who fought to succeed Boris Johnson as Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss, parroted Farage in their frantic attempt to appeal to Tory Party members who chose the new PM. As predicted, Truss won. (The British electorate as a whole was not allowed to vote.) At an earlier stage of the contest, all the candidates said they supported the Rwanda deportation plan – despite the fact that several of them are, like Patel and Sunak, the children of immigrants to the UK. (Sunak’s parents were born in Kenya and Tanganyika, Patel’s are from Uganda.)\n\nFear of a mass invasion by Africans features in much of this rhetoric. Online comments contain hysterical claims that “the whole continent” is headed for Europe. “Most of Africa would prefer to live in Britain”, posted a reader at the Daily Telegraph on 22 June, one example that stands for many. In fact, the top countries of migrants’ origin include non-African countries such as Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Albania, Myanmar and Vietnam.\n\nThe deportation plan can be seen as the culmination of the Tories’ hostile environment policy towards immigrants, which was first introduced ten years ago. In 2012, the then Home Secretary, Theresa May, announced a strategy aimed at tackling “illegal” immigration by making life so unbearable for certain migrants they would voluntarily choose to leave. May herself used the words “a really hostile environment”. (Ironically, she now criticises the Rwanda deportation policy.) However, the opposition Labour Party first coined the expression in 2007. The then Labour immigration minister Liam Byrne referred to the desirability of creating a “hostile environment” in a consultation document that year, although the policy was not implemented. He has angrily denied May’s claims that Labour invented it.\n\nMigration within colonial Kenya\n\nSwitching my focus to Kenya and the deeper historical context of forced migration, many of the internal relocations that took place in colonial Kenya (and the British protectorate that preceded it, before 1920) involved coercing Africans into leaving home to labour for white settlers. They moved seasonally in large numbers. “Squatters had not looked for work; [Lord Delamere] had sent for them, fetching their families and flocks by train”, writes historian John Lonsdale. However, not all displacement was coerced; this denies African and Asian agency, and overlooks all the other reasons why men, and women (often ignored in migration studies), moved as individuals in search of work.\n\nThe deportation plan can be seen as the culmination of the Tories’ hostile environment policy towards immigrants, which was first introduced ten years ago.\n\nNorman Leys (a medical doctor and rights activist) reported how many colonial district officers initially refused to comply with demands from settlers and other private employers to use their influence and procure labourers. “Then an agitation began in Nairobi and in London. As a result of that agitation instructions were sent to district officers that, while no compulsion was to be used, ‘moral suasion’ was to be resorted to, chiefs were to be ‘encouraged’ to persuade their people to leave home to work for Europeans.” Then as now, Anglican bishops issued a statement condemning the plan. “We believe that ideally all labour should be voluntary. We recognise that, at present, this is impossible … [But] we are of the opinion that compulsory labour, so long as it is clearly necessary, should be definitely legalised.”\n\nUnder colonial vagrancy laws, it even became impossible for Africans who were not in employment to move around the country. The raising of the hut and poll tax also “encouraged” (Leys’ word, he was being ironic) Africans to seek wage labour outside their home areas. Settler estates depended on African labour to function, but recruitment proved difficult. Some settlers resorted to “exceptional violence” in order to get labour, in the words of scholars Bruce Berman and John Lonsdale. “The ferocity and unpredictability of the settler assault on the African population threatened to undermine the whole apparatus of colonial control”. The state had to step in to control labour supply, and did so after World War I when mass forced conscription into the Carrier Corps was seen to have been a “success”. (Some success; 95,000 African porters died.) It was a matter of carrots but more often sticks, as this appalling statement exemplifies:\n\nI always treat my natives the same as I treat my children, I try to be kind to them, and to advise and direct them, but when kindness has no effect you have to do the same as they do in the public schools at home and throughout the empire – cane them. (Lt. Col. J.G. Kirkwood, Legislative Council member, Legco debate, 28 November 1941).\n\nThe language of infantilization persists today in the narratives around migrants.\n\nAlthough the state, including the railway, was the largest single employer in the country at this point, thousands of men moved seasonally between the settler estates and African reserves, where their families tended to remain on the land. But over time, whole families moved to live on settler estates as squatters, and were initially allowed to bring their cattle with them. They grew subsistence crops, while women and children also provided labour to settlers during peak harvest and planting times. By 1931, the number of squatters in the highlands had risen to 113,176, the majority Kikuyu. They occupied one million acres of settler land, some of it land that the Maasai had formerly occupied. Although this arrangement brought some benefits for squatters (for one, it allowed them to expand beyond crowded Kikuyuland, creating a toe-hold that lasts to this day), harsh new laws forced African compliance with government. One of the most hated was the Registration of Natives Ordinance of 1915, which forced all males over the age of 15 to carry a form of identity called the kipande.\n\nOver time, settlers became alarmed about the large number of squatter stock on their land, and fearing the diseases that this stock allegedly carried, began forcing squatters and their stock off farms. Resentment at this was among the issues that sowed the seeds of Mau Mau (aka the Land and Freedom Army). “The squatters saw their economic deprivation as linked to their political subordination and it was these two problems that they hoped to eradicate when they took the oath and swore to support the Mau Mau movement,” wrote Tabitha Kanogo in her ground-breaking book Squatters and the Roots of Mau Mau.\n\nMaasai and other forced moves\n\nSome communities were forcibly moved in their thousands, to become internally displaced in other parts of colonial Kenya. The most infamous forced migrations were the Maasai moves following two treaties or “agreements” made between Maasai leaders and British protectorate officials in 1904 and 1911. The moves were ordered to make way for white settlement, first in the central Rift Valley, later in the highlands of Laikipia. Maasai from certain socio-territorial sections (not the Maasai as a whole) were initially moved into two reserves, one in the north, the other in the south on the border with German territory (later Tanganyika and Tanzania). In 1904, the British promised the Maasai they could keep Laikipia for ever. But only seven years later, under pressure from settlers, they broke their pledge and moved the Maasai again, this time at gunpoint, into an enlarged southern reserve in what is now Narok County.\n\nIt is estimated that the Maasai lost up to at least 50 per cent of the territory they had once used, but the figure could be nearer 70 per cent. The losses did not just involve land, but included the loss of good grazing, access to water sources and sacred sites, and the fatal exposure of both humans and livestock to diseases like East Coast fever and malaria, which were unknown in Laikipia in those days. The ripple effects of these events continue to the present day, in agitation by Maasai for the return of lost land or compensation. Neither is likely to materialise, for a variety of reasons.\n\nThe language of infantilization persists today in the narratives around migrants.\n\nFears about Maasai warriors and the assumed threat they posed to Europeans in the early years of colonial rule were remarkably similar to the current rhetoric in Britain, centred on the irrational fear of “hordes of young men of fighting age” arriving on our shores. Not only is their potential (but unproven) violence feared, but also their perceived sexuality – “Lock up your daughters!” is the cry of the anti-migrant Tory right. This is obviously part of a larger racist trope, referred to as the “black peril” in the scholarship on settler colonies, but also prevalent in the USA, especially in the formerly segregated Deep South.\n\nBritish administrators saw the warriors as a dangerous standing army, which could let rip at any moment. In a discussion of the merits of confining the Maasai to reserves, Protectorate Commissioner Sir Charles Eliot (the equivalent of a governor) wrote to the Foreign Office in 1903: “[Maasai] simplicity, loyalty, and soldierlike qualities inspire a sympathy which makes people forget that a race which regards fighting and raiding as the only occupations for a young man of honour can never be anything but a dangerous race.” He also condemned the warriors’ alleged “immorality”. In fact, as other officials who knew the Maasai better than Eliot were constantly telling him, they had never attacked Europeans and posed no danger. “And they are not likely to,” wrote Deputy Commissioner Frederick Jackson, “so long as they are treated fairly”. On the contrary, several administrators sympathetic to the Maasai feared that racist South African settlers in the Rift Valley might attack the Maasai if they were not physically separated. For these and other reasons, they were forced into reserves.\n\nToday, the Maasai are not alone in their grievance with historical injustices. The Talai clan of Kericho County, part of the Kipsigis community, has for years sought reparations for forced resettlement. The British evicted them in 1934-36 from the Kipsigis Reserve to an allegedly mosquito-infested valley at Gwassi near Lake Victoria, where they stayed, under supervision, until the mid-1950s. They claim to have been moved to make way for tea plantations, some of which are still owned by UK-based multinationals. A group of Talai wrote to Prince William (elder son of King Charles III) in May this year seeking an apology and his support for reparations. The letter says: “We inherited the pain, you inherited the profit.” They hoped for sympathy from Will “because Kenya is special to him”. Earlier appeals to the British government appear to have received no reply.\n\nSome communities were forcibly moved in their thousands, to become internally displaced in other parts of colonial Kenya.\n\nHistorians who have researched Talai history, most particularly the role of ritual leaders or orkoiik, say there is in fact no evidence that the Talai were evicted from land that became tea estates. But they were certainly evicted under colonial laws, said one leading scholar, and “unquestionably have a case”. UN human rights rapporteurs investigated the case and found for the Talai in 2021, which the community hailed as a great victory. However, the UN may have “ordered” the British government to apologise and pay compensation, but that does not mean anything will happen. The Tory government has been a tad preoccupied since Prime Minister Boris Johnson was ousted, and a bitter struggle ensued to replace him. And since Prince William has no political power or influence, all he can say is pole sana.\n\nThe Rwanda scheme is becoming more bogged down by the day. It recently emerged that British ministers who backed the plan were warned months ago, by the government’s own advisor, that Rwanda tortures and kills political opponents. The government wants to keep these comments in a Foreign Office report secret, partly in order not to offend Rwanda. Media houses, including the BBC, are challenging this. The doomed flights are postponed until after a judicial review of the policy at the High Court, London, which began on 5 September and is expected to last five days. President Paul Kagame has also thrown a spanner in the works by announcing, after pocketing the £120 million down-payment, that Rwanda will only take 200 migrants – a drop in the ocean. Patel and the Home Office she previously headed (she resigned on Monday 5 September, hours after Truss’s victory) made a major mistake by not specifying, in the MoU with Rwanda, how many migrants Britain planned to deport. Some of us suspect that our government never intended to carry out the policy in the first place. It was simply red meat thrown to Brexit voters.\n\n–\n\nThis article is part of a series on migration and displacement in and from Africa, co-produced by the Elephant and the Heinrich Boll Foundation’s African Migration Hub, which is housed at its new Horn of Africa Office in Nairobi.",

    "Former Kenyan President to Lead Peace Process in DRC, Ethiopia": "Kenya's President William Ruto has appointed his predecessor, former President Uhuru Kenyatta, as a peace envoy to the Democratic Republic of Congo and Ethiopia.\n\nAs president, Kenyatta was previously involved in peace efforts in both countries, which are dealing with resurgent rebels and ongoing war. While Kenyatta's new role as peace envoy has been welcomed, analysts say mediation in the DRC and Ethiopia will be no small challenge.\n\nRuto said Kenyatta accepted the task and will be working on behalf of Kenya.\n\nKenneth Ombongi, a senior lecturer at the University of Nairobi, said continuity is vital in finding a peaceful solution to a conflict.\n\n“[Kenyatta] comes into it with some level of continuity which is important for dealing with delicate issues that touch on peace, reconciliation, and also post-conflict development… that’s extremely important,” Ombongi said. “He comes with a very clear memory of what has been going on and what the development has been.”\n\nIn April, Kenyatta hosted DRC President Felix Tshisekedi and some rebel groups operating in the east of the country for peace talks. East African Community leaders subsequently agreed to deploy regional troops to the eastern DRC in a bid to restore normalcy in the region.\n\nIn November last year, Kenyatta visited Ethiopia to work on peace efforts and bring together the government and rebel group Tigray People’s Liberation Front in the country's north.\n\nProfessor Chacha Nyaigotti Chacha, an expert in diplomacy and international relations, said Kenya stands to benefit from the peace efforts it’s undertaking in the region.\n\n“This is a national, regional and international assignment and it's important that assignment is undertaken because when these countries neighboring Kenya in the East Africa Community region, as well as the Horn region, when they are peaceful, then Kenya is also peaceful and Kenya can, for example, derive a lot of gains especially as far as trade, communication and transport are concerned,” Chacha said.\n\nOmbongi said Kenyatta will likely get a cool reception from countries that didn’t like his foreign policy when he was president, especially Ethiopia.\n\n“The relationship between Addis Ababa and Nairobi has been what we describe in archaic language –ish –ish, he said. “So he will face certain challenges but of course, there is a possibility that his status as a senior statesman can very easily actually work to his advantage.”\n\nCalls for peace in the DRC and Ethiopia have grown, but the warring factions have yet to agree on the issues to be discussed or who will chair the peace process.\n\nChacha said Kenyatta will deal with rigid warring sides that are not afraid to walk out of the peace process and continue with the armed conflict.\n\n“The challenges he will face are going to be challenges of the groupings in these countries that there is an antagonistic grouping of some who are belligerent,” he said. “They usually agree to talk but sometimes they don’t fulfill their commitment to ensuring that they can return to the peaceful coexistence in their countries.\"\n\nThe U.S. government and the European Union have welcomed the appointment of Kenyatta and said they are ready to support the efforts to bring lasting peace to the two countries.",

    "Kenya’s Central Bank forecasts economy reboot after peaceful political transition": "By JAMES ANYANZWA More by this Author\n\nThe Central Bank of Kenya is projecting a better performance for the country’s economy, leaving behind months of electioneering and uncertainty that saw it fail in a Eurobond launch earlier in the year.\n\nKenya swore in its new president on September 13, bringing to an end uncertainty around its political future.\n\nNow the banking regulator says the peaceful change in leadership has coincided with stabilising global prices for basic commodities, which could reboot the economy.\n\nCentral Bank Governor Patrick Njoroge told Kenyan MPs this week that the economy is expected to remain “strong” this year despite weaker global growth and economic shocks triggered by the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\n“Economic growth is expected to remain strong in 2022. Prices of palm oil, DAP fertiliser and wheat have moderated,” said Dr Njoroge at an induction session for new MPs.\n\n“The price of oil has moderated but remains volatile,” he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKenya’s economy has been going through lean times. It has seen its forex reserves shrink as food and fuel prices rise, its shilling depreciates and credit to the private sector falls.\n\nThe economy is also saddled with debts, which now stand at $70 billion.\n\nIn June, the government cancelled a $1 billion Eurobond as a result of turbulence in the global financial markets. President William Ruto has scrapped the fuel and maize meal flour subsidy programmes to ease the government’s growing expenditure pressures.\n\nResearchers at Cytonn Investments noted that the government’s increased accumulation of debt has not translated into economic growth, as more than 40 percent of the collected revenues have gone to repay debt.\n\nKenya’s public debt has increased more than five-fold to Ksh8.6 trillion ($71.66 billion) in May 2022 from Ksh1.6 trillion ($13.33 billion) in May 2012.\n\nCytonn noted that the public debt increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 18.2 percent in the last 10 years, compared to an average Gross Domestic Product growth of 3.9 percent over the period.\n\n“The increase in debt is not translating into GDP growth,” Cytonn Investments said in a September 11 market report.\n\nDebt accumulation\n\nMounting debt has put pressure on central bank forex reserves, further eroding the value of the shilling which is swinging at around Ksh120 against the US dollar.\n\n“Kenya’s general business environment continues to be weighed down by the elevated inflationary pressures emanating from supply chain constraints and a depreciating local currency,” Cytonn Investments said.\n\n“The recovery of the private sector business environment in Kenya is largely pegged on how quickly the global economy stabilises and how soon the inflationary pressures ease,” it added.\n\nKenya’s GDP increased by 6.8 percent in the first quarter of 2022, compared to a 2.7 percent growth in the same period last year.\n\nHowever, overall inflation accelerated for six consecutive months to 8.5 percent in August from 8.3 percent in July, largely driven by high fuel and food prices.\n\nDisbursement of loans to key economic sectors declined to 2.5 percent between April and June compared to 4.1 percent in the previous quarter.\n\nBusiness environment\n\nThe elevated credit risk has led to 8.6 percent increase in gross non-performing loans to Ksh514.4 billion ($4.28 billion) in June 2022 from Ksh473.7 billion ($3.94 billion) in March 2022.\n\n“This is largely attributable to the deteriorated business environment as a result of the increased inflationary pressures emanating from imported inflation bill,” CBK said.\n\n“Going forward, we expect the business environment to remain subdued given the persistent supply chain bottlenecks that have seen the cost of inputs continue to rise.”",
    "How Kenya Became the World’s Geothermal Powerhouse": "Geophysicist Nicholas Mariita remembers when Kenya’s geothermal sector wasn’t the high-tech powerhouse it is today. In the early 1980s, he regularly joined teams of scientists on expeditions into the country’s Great Rift Valley to survey for potential sites where the Earth could be tapped for a prime subterranean energy source. They weren’t looking for oil or coal — they were looking for heat, the key resource in geothermal power.\n\nThe Great Rift Valley was still wild then, so dodging snakes and buffalo was part of the job. “One in a while, we’d be chased by a buffalo and have to climb into a tree, and if it was a clever one, it’d flick urine at you with its tail,” Mariita recalls. “Those were the kind of funny things we went through.”\n\nTheir risk has yielded results. In 2020 and 2021, some 48 percent of all electricity generated in Kenya came from geothermal — the highest share of any country. And as the world seeks to increase both the quantity and cleanliness of its electricity, it’s a cheap, bountiful and low-carbon option Kenya plans to increasingly rely on.\n\nRising megawatts\n\nThe idea of geothermal generation in the Olkaria Area — located 44 miles northwest of Nairobi in the Great Rift Valley — was first considered in the 1950s. A consortium of power companies, led by the East African Power and Lighting Company, drilled two test wells. But efforts to make power from them were stymied by technical problems. By the turn of the decade, the wells — and the dream of geothermal power — had largely been abandoned.\n\n“In those days, almost 90 percent of our electricity came from hydropower,” says Mariita, now the director of the Geothermal Training and Research Institute of the Dedan Kimathi University of Technology.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, however, leaving geothermal resources untapped became untenable. A fickle hydroelectric grid and the global oil crisis left the country, then in its second decade of independence, starved for power. “To avoid power rationing,” says Mariita, “the government had to change its strategy.”\n\nWith assistance from the United Nations, the public-owned Kenya Power took charge of the effort in 1977.\n\nThe first geothermal plant in Africa came online in June 1981. Upon its inauguration, the Olkaria I plant comprised just one turbine with a generating capacity of 15 megawatts (roughly 2.7 percent of nationwide capacity at the time), but expansion followed. In 1982, Kenya’s parliament passed the Geothermal Resources Act, which established a formal legal framework for geothermal investment, siting and licensing. That same year, a second turbine, also 15 MW, was added to Olkaria I.\n\nIn 1997, Kenya Power Company became the Kenya Electricity Generating Company (known as KenGen), and investment ramped up significantly. In the last two decades of the 20th century, Kenya installed some 93 megawatts of generating capacity. In the first two decades of this century some 531 megawatts of capacity came online. With the July 2022 opening of Olkaria V and a sixth turbine added at Olkaria I came some 258 MW of new capacity — bringing the country’s total to some 882 MW.\n\nLooking forward, some 300 MW of capacity are expected to come online upon the completion of new projects both at Olkaria and beyond. By 2030, in line with the country’s green development goals, Kenya hopes to have 1,600 MW — almost double today’s total — up and running.\n\nThat energy is needed to achieve Kenya Vision 2030. The government plans rapid industrialization so the country can rise to middle-income status by the end of this decade.\n\nOf all renewables, geothermal energy is especially useful for industrialization, a goal shared by countries across Africa. For one, unlike sources such as wind and solar, it provides a reliable stream of power critical to energy-intensive industrial processes. Moreover, geothermal need not be converted to electricity at all: Direct applications — where geothermal steam itself is used — abound.\n\nAround the world, geothermal wells are used to heat buildings, can food and process textiles. In Kenya, the Naivasha-based Oserian Development Company has used geothermal steam to heat its flower-farm greenhouses, which are among the largest on Earth.\n\nHeat seeking\n\nGeothermal energy is not a green panacea, of course. For one, the construction of new wells, like any infrastructure, can encroach upon natural ecosystems and displace communities. The Olkaria plants, for instance, have forced hundreds of semi-nomadic Maasai families indigenous to the Great Rift Valley to relocate, though KenGen has made efforts to both employ Maasai people and mitigate the effects of displacement.\n\nMoreover, the geothermal potential of any given area is determined by immutable geologic characteristics.\n\nFor the last 20 million years or so, the Somali minor tectonic plate has been crawling southeast, shearing Africa’s westernmost edge from the rest of the continent, which sits on the northwest-bound African plate. Diverging plates form gaps in the Earth’s solid outermost layer, the lithosphere. From within those gaps seeps the layer beneath, the asthenosphere. Those bits of asthenosphere fill the void left by the parting plates, and a few millimeters — and million years — at a time, become a new crust.\n\nBut the patch job is not perfect. Just as tectonic collisions form mountains, divergence creates swaths of crust just a bit thinner and more porous than average. Those who live on that thin crust live closer to what’s underneath: heat.\n\nNot every country falls on a tectonic rift. However, massive amounts of geothermal potential remain untapped in the world.\n\nThis May, a group of Egyptian geologists — led by Mohamed Abdel Zaher, a geologist at the National Research Institute of Astronomy and Geophysics in Cairo — created a first of its kind analysis of high geothermal potential regions in Africa, using data on faults, heat levels and magnetic forces. They found 14 areas of interest, from Algeria to Namibia to Malawi, South Africa, Liberia and beyond. “Africa has very high potential,” says Zaher.\n\nGeothermal’s impact is not just measured in megawatts in Kenya today. When Nicholas Mariita began his career, its then-nascent geothermal sector relied on outside expertise. “In those days, we used consultants from the United States, Japan and New Zealand,” says Mariita.\n\nIn the 40 years since, Kenya has built not only world-leading physical geothermal infrastructure, but the human capital to support it. Through geothermal energy, Kenya has found an unshakeable source of power — in all its meanings.\n\n“Now, Kenyans actually do the exploration work, the impact assessment, the project planning, the design of the plants and so on,” says Mariita. “You go to one of our projects, and you see Kenyans are in charge.”",
    "Will U.S.-China Competition Shape Kenya’s Trade Trajectory?": "Kenya’s much anticipated presidential election recently concluded with the Supreme Court confirming President William Ruto’s victory. In the runup to this close contest, Kenya’s political discourse was for once focused on economic and policy concerns. As the new government takes up the reins of administration, trade will feature in the policy solutions to ongoing challenges like rising unemployment rates, Kenya’s large public sector debt, concerns around equitable taxation, and the residual effects of global shocks such as the coronavirus pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war. In charting the direction of the country’s post-election economic policy, trade will be important in various ways: its volume, bridging Kenya’s trade deficit, and the country’s external relations.\n\nA cursory look at Kenya’s international trade reveals some striking patterns (see figure 1). The country’s total merchandise trade volume in 2020 amounted to $21 billion or 21 percent of GDP. More than 16 percent of this total is from trade with China (the country’s top trading partner), followed by the EU ($2.9 billion), India ($1.8 billion), and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) ($1.2 billion). The United States (nearly $1.0 billion) is Kenya’s fifth-largest trade partner. Other major economic partners include Uganda and Tanzania, both in East Africa. These trade relationships with major external partners will shape the new Kenyan government’s policy objectives especially around increasing the productivity of agriculture, manufacturing, and small businesses.\n\nKenya’s international trade is also an area where great power competition could play out. The country’s main exports to the United States, in 2019, were fairly diversified and included woven apparel ($286 million); knit apparel ($168 million); edible fruit and nuts ($55 million); ores, slag, and ash ($52 million); and coffee, tea, and spice ($41 million). This trade was enabled in large part by the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, the preferential market access agreement for countries south of the Sahara. Meanwhile, Kenya imported aircraft ($59 million), plastics ($58 million), machinery ($41 million), and cereals ($30 million) from the United States.\n\nZainab Usman Zainab Usman is a senior fellow and director of the Africa Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, D.C. Her fields of expertise include institutions, economic policy, energy policy, and emerging economies in Africa. More >\n\nThere are ongoing discussions between the United States and Kenya for a free trade agreement as Kenya seeks to become a manufacturing hub for U.S. companies looking to diversify or relocate out of China. In the interim, the two countries signed the U.S.-Kenya Strategic Trade and Investment Partnership (STIP) in July 2022, an agreement that identified areas around which to “develop an ambitious roadmap for enhanced cooperation with the goal of negotiating high-standard commitments in order to achieve economically meaningful outcomes.” The initial areas of collaboration include agriculture; digital trade; micro, small, and medium enterprises; supporting the participation of women, youth, and others in trade; collaboration on standards setting; and trade facilitation and customs procedures.\n\nThe U.S.-Kenya STIP was launched against the backdrop of China’s rapidly rising trade relationship with Kenya. Since 2000, China-Kenya trade has grown nearly thirty-fold, from $106 million to $3.5 billion in 2020. As these trade volumes have grown, so has Kenya’s trade deficit. The country’s total trade deficit as of 2020 stands at around $9.7 billion, and China ($3.3 billion) accounts for about one-third of this imbalance (see figure 2). Between 2015 and 2019, for instance, Kenya’s main exports to China were “titanium and zirconium ores and concentrates” (around 60 percent), vegetable textile fibers (4.9 percent), and petroleum oils (4.7 percent), among others. Its major imports are “electrical machinery and equipment (19 percent); nuclear reactors, boilers, machinery, and mechanical appliances and parts (18 percent); iron and steel (7 percent); and plastics (6 percent).”\n\nClosing this trade deficit is a salient topic that features regularly in diplomatic engagement between the two countries. Indeed, it was one of the announcements at the 2021 Forum on China-Africa Cooperation. In January 2022, China and Kenya also signed six bilateral trade agreements that focused on removing tariffs and other trade and nontrade barriers. These agreements promised access to China’s large market for Kenyan exporters and included protocols to facilitate bilateral trade, especially exports of avocados and aquatic products. In August 2022, Kenya became the first African country to export fresh avocados to China.\n\nAline Abayo Aline Abayo is a James C. Gaither Junior Fellow in the Carnegie Africa Program.\n\nBeyond the United States and China, Kenya has strong and growing trade relations with other major countries. The UAE imports refined petroleum, tea, and meat from Kenya. In July 2022, the UAE and Kenya announced the start of trade negotiations to initiate a comprehensive economic partnership agreement that aims to reduce trade barriers between the two countries. With this agreement, the UAE will invest in Kenya's vital economic sectors, such as tourism and agriculture, and boost non-oil trade and investment. Kenya also signed an economic partnership agreement with the UK in December 2020; the agreement provided quota-free and duty-free market access for all Kenyan products, including manufactured and processed ones. The agreement also guaranteed tariff-free access to Kenya’s market for UK suppliers of machinery, electronics, and technical equipment, among others.\n\nWithin Africa, Kenya is a critical actor driving some aspects of regional integration. With its 2021 GDP of $110.3 billion, it is the largest economy and major driver of rapid integration in the East African Community (EAC). It is no surprise, therefore, that Kenya ranked second on regional integration in Africa. The EAC ranks highest on the Africa Regional Integration Index, with the free movement of people as its most robust dimension. An Afrobarometer survey on East African integration shows that 52 percent of Kenyans approve of the free movement of goods, services, and labor. However, there is still a gap in public awareness and support for this integration.\n\nKenya’s notable progress in securing regional and international trade deals is positioning the country as an important trading economy. It will be crucial for Kenya to balance its overlapping and complicated relationships with the great powers, its trade ties with neighbors in the EAC, and its interest in advancing the African Continental Free Trade Area. As Kenya’s new president takes office, trade policy will be at the heart of the country’s plans to close its trade deficit, generate jobs, increase public revenues, and boost productivity.",
    "Kenya: Anticipatory actions towards General Elections - Operation Update Report - DREF n° MDRKE051, Operation update n° 1 - Kenya": "Summary of major revisions made to emergency plan of action:\n\nThis operation update informs stakeholders on actions undertaken since starting the anticipatory actions on 1st May 2022 through the General Elections held on 9th August 2022, the proclamation of results which took place on 15th August 2022, and subsequent Supreme Court final decision on elections results made on 5th September.\n\nIndeed, after the election results were announced on 15th August, there were cases of localized disturbances in several parts of the country including Mombasa, Kisumu, Wajir, Migori, Garissa, Busia, Kisii, Homa Bay, Siaya, West Pokot, Kakamega, Uasin Gishu, Kericho, Kiambu, and Bungoma. At the same time, 8 elective areas including the gubernatorial elections for Kakamega and Mombasa counties were postponed by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) to 29th August (22 August Nation Media Reports). Furthermore, the presidential results announced on 15th August 2022 were challenged and several petitions were filed at the Supreme Court (Nation) with a decision made by the court on 5th September.\n\nThe localized disturbances resulted in emergency needs which prompted the Kenyan Red Cross Society (KRCS) to respond with First Aid services, mental health, and psychosocial support and increased monitoring of the various political activities reaching 769 people in 12 counties. This Operation Update informs on response actions following the triggering of the majority of indicators in scenario 2 of the EPoA, leading to an increase in KRCS preparedness and response and therefore incurring additional costs. Key revisions in this operation include below:\n\n• KRCS maintaining its volunteers, staff, and logistics on the ground beyond the planned 2 days in EPoA to ensure comprehensive monitoring and coverage of the various events until 30th September.\n\n• Cater costs resulting from extending and adapting the surveillance and assistance to 6 hotspot counties (Garissa, Wajir, Homabay, West Pokot, Kakamega, and Kitui), in addition to 6 initial target counties (Kisumu, Nairobi, Mombasa, Nakuru, Uasin Gishu and Kiambu).\n\n• KRCS has extended preparedness activities including PFA refresher training sessions ambulance prepositioning, maintaining teams on standby, and conducting transect drives in high-risk areas in Kakamega, Kitui, West Pokot, Mombasa, Nakuru, and Meru while awaiting the completion of vote extended and waiting also the Supreme Court ruling on the 5th September and surveillance for additional days after it was completed. In this regard, the below adjustments have been conducted:\n\nRed Cross Action Teams (RCAT): Deployment of first aid volunteers for additional 6 days in 6 targeted counties and 6 additional counties. To cover the pending elections in Kakamega and Mombasa, the time until the court decision. Same 270 volunteers and 30 supervisors deployed for 6 extended days and adapted to the operational imperative: 30 volunteers and 3 supervisors deployed per high-risk counties and 15 volunteers for the other hotspots.\n\nAmbulances and vehicles prepositioned and deployed (2 days prior and 4 days after) as the need arises in the two areas (Kakamega and Mombasa counties) where gubernatorial elections will be held. In total, over the 12 hotspots, 6 ambulances, and 13 vehicles were deployed plus 1 in Nairobi.\n\nConduct monitoring and passive surveillance until the end of the operation in high-risk areas in Kakamega, Kitui, West Pokot (hotspot identified during the response), Mombasa, Nakuru, and Meru (initially targeted areas). This includes maintaining teams on standby to continue undertaking regular transect drives at hotspot areas for direct observations covering investiture and post-investiture until the end of September to respond to any emergency needs.\n\n• Ensure proper closing of the operation by 30th September 2022 with an operational learning session.\n\nA budget increase of CHF 75,428 from the initial allocation of CHF 189,070 is also requested to cover the additional costs incurred from activities listed above within the same timeframe initially allocated (4 months).\n\nA. SITUATION ANALYSIS\n\nDescription of the disaster\n\nKenya held its General Elections on 9 August 2022 as planned. With 14,164,561 registered voters, a low voter turnout was reported with 64.6% Kenyans voting, a dip from the 80% turnout in 2017. Vote counting and verification by the Independent Elections and Commission (IEBC) Board was a protracted process resulting in speculations, misinformation, and disinformation spreading through social media and other platforms. This fuelled public anxiety as the country awaited the announcement of the results of the president with a close call between the two main contending candidates of the opposing coalitional parties. The IEBC announced one of the coalition leaders as the president-elect on 15 August 2022, while four IEBC commissioners disputed the presidential election outcomes citing the opaqueness of the process. On 17 August 2022, one of the other presidential candidates issued an announcement rejecting the declared presidential results by the IEBC.\n\nThe voting day, while generally peaceful in most parts of the country, was also marred by events in some counties such as injuries due to fighting at polling stations, malfunction of the Kenya Integrated Elections Management system (KIEMS) Kits, as reported by nation media and IEBC briefings, resorting to using of manual registers and insecurity concerns in areas such as Eldas, Wajir county where voting was postponed to 10th August (Citizen digital Reports). In addition, violence outbreaks were reported in various counties including Wajir, Kisii, Kisumu, Uasin Gishu, Baringo, Bungoma, Nakuru, Nairobi, Kiambu, Garissa, Kericho, Migori, Homa bay, Machakos, Siaya, West Pokot, Kakamega, Kitui, Bomet, Nyamira, Kajiado, and Busia (Star Newspaper, Nation Media), leading to 16 fatalities and 143 persons injured and receiving first aid services as recorded by the KRCS daily situation reports since the election day. Nation Media), leading to 16 fatalities and 143 persons injured and receiving first aid services as recorded by the KRCS daily situation reports since the election day.\n\nKRCS has been updating its elections situation analysis based on its Contingency Plan and the unfolding situation. Based on the triggering of several indicators, the unfolding scenario in the country is aligned with scenario 2 of the EPoA with localized post-electoral contestations, a contested process, contested IEBC services, isolated incidents of violence, long-awaited declaration of the results and postponement of elections in 8 localities with some found in the targeted hotspot counties identified.\n\nSome of the critical events to note include the voting day, 9th August, which was generally calm across the country, 10th August when different provisional results circulated across media platforms, and which were later directed to stop reporting by the IEBC. Localized violence and disturbances were reported particularly between the 11th and 15th of August in some areas including the hotspot counties of Nakuru, Kisumu, Garissa, Narok, Bomet, Mombasa, and Wajir counties. The declaration of the presidential results on 15th August resulted in a contested IEBC service, process, and rejection of the election results by the losing coalition and 4 of the IEBC commissioners. As a result, a petition challenging the presidential results was filed at the Supreme Court with a verdict rendered on 5th September 2022. Reactions to this decision and the swearing-in ceremony will be observed until 30th September.",
    "Kenya's China-Built Railway to Lose Business, Shifting Cost to Taxpayers": "In one of his first acts in office, Kenya’s new president, William Ruto, ordered cargo containers from incoming ships to be emptied at the port of Mombasa instead of in the capital, Nairobi. Ruto said he is carrying out a campaign promise, though there are concerns the move could overwhelm facilities at the Mombasa port.\n\n\n\nIn 2019, the Kenyan government shifted cargo clearance operations from Kenya’s Indian Ocean port of Mombasa to the inland cities of Nairobi and Naivasha.\n\n\n\nThis week, Ruto directed that the operations be returned to Mombasa.\n\n\n\n“I will be issuing instructions for clearing of goods and other attended operational issues to revert to the port of Mombasa as I made a commitment to Kenyans,” Ruto said. “This will restore thousands of jobs in the city of Mombasa.”\n\n\n\nFormer President Uhuru Kenyatta had moved cargo clearance to Nairobi to increase use of the Standard Gauge Railway, which was built with a $4.5 billion loan from China. The move forced companies to pay transport fees to use the railway — a decision Kenyan officials saw as the best way to repay the loan.\n\nRuto’s decision, announced Tuesday, is welcomed by newly-elected Mombasa governor Abdulswamad Shariff Nassir, who said the need to repay the debt is not reason to kill business at his city’s port.\n\n\n\n“We have been fighting for it for a long time and we said openly, even if it was to repay the SGR debt, there are other ways to repay it. It’s not a must to kill the economy of one part of the country.”\n\n\n\nAccording to the Economic Survey of 2022, SGR usage increased by 22.6 percent in 2021 and made $108 million, up from $87 million in 2020. The increase is attributed to cargo shipments to Nairobi.\n\nWith cargo clearance operations shifting back to Mombasa, many people are concerned that the railway will lose business to trucking companies, making it difficult for the railway to pay its debt, and ultimately shifting the cost of its construction to taxpayers.\n\nSome traders argued that historically the Mombasa port has been slow to unload and transport cargo containers.\n\n\n\nGerrishon Ikiara, an economics teacher at the University of Nairobi, predicts the Mombasa port will not be able to handle the increased responsibilities.\n\n\n\n“Very shortly, we will start getting the impact of the delayed cargo and other inconveniences, overcrowding of Mombasa highway and corruption in the police office at every point.”\n\n\n\nGovernance and urban development expert Alfred Omenya is hopeful the problems can be overcome, if the government appoints good managers to run the port.\n\n\n\n\"I think the president did the right thing,” he said. “We hope that it’s not an ad hoc political action, but it will be an action that will be based on coherent planning, coherent strategy and coherent development of our country.”\n\n\n\nIn a worst-case scenario, congestion and corruption at the Mombasa port will make traders from neighboring countries flock to other ports, making Kenya lose much-needed revenue for developing and servicing its debt.",
    "‘Restoring the river’: why Kenyans are returning to precolonial spirituality": "Wairimu Mukuru started sharing TikTok videos about Kikuyu culture earlier this year. Within months, the 26-year-old had gained more than 60,000 followers and received at least 1m views of her videos, where she talks about her ethnic group’s traditional practices and beliefs on topics such as mental health and sex.\n\nMukuru, a Kikuyu language teacher, is one of a small but growing number of Kenyans from the country’s largest ethnic group, the Agīkūyū, who are trying to revive precolonial cultural and spiritual practices. The belief systems were suppressed and marginalised during British colonial rule in the 19th century, and as Christianity became more entrenched.\n\nWairimu Mukuru started sharing TikTok videos about Kikuyu culture this year. Photograph: TikTok\n\n“Westernisation was entangled with Christianity,” says King’ori wa Kanyi, a member of the Agīkūyū Council of Elders. “A good African convert had to take a European name, dress like a European and visit the clinic instead of the herbalist.”\n\nAbout 85% of Kenyans identify as Christians and the religion has become an entrenched part of the country’s political and cultural fabric, marking naming, birth, marriage and political ceremonies.\n\n“There’s a new kind of Pentecostalism that has consumed much of how we understand ourselves,” says Kamau Wairuri, a socio-political researcher at the Edinburgh University. “Since people are not familiar with other alternatives, those looking to practise a different kind of spirituality might not know where to begin.”\n\nAdherents of Kikuyu spirituality say it is inseparable from their culture and is treated as a way of life. During colonial rule, the community fought to retain their spiritual systems but the practices were labelled as “savage” pagan religions and ultimately pushed to the margins.\n\n“Colonialism destroyed indigenous African religions, labelling them primitive and not good for the modern age,” said Jacob Olupona, a professor of African religious traditions at Harvard divinity school. “With time, Africans stopped seeing something good in their own traditions. Those belief systems became so marginalised that some have become like secret societies.”\n\nToday, less than 2% of Kenyans practise traditional beliefs. But experts say accurate estimates are elusive because many practise indigenous belief systems alongside mainstream religions such as Christianity and Islam.\n\nAlthough the numbers are fairly low across Africa, and many of those who do practise traditional religions are seen as outliers, some Kikuyu elders say that there has been a slow but gradual shift in attitudes within the community.\n\n“Many people are now rejecting European imposed religious and cultural identities,” says Kanyi, adding that among the Agīkūyū, there is a term for the efforts to revive indigenous beliefs, which translates as “restoring the river to its original course”.\n\nKikuyu girls in 1936-37 at a Church of Scotland mission school in Kenya, where they were dressed in European clothes and taught domestic skills. Photograph: Universal Images/Alamy\n\nExperts say interest has grown as a rising number of the African diaspora returned to the continent over the past decade, in search of their ancestral traditions. “It has emboldened those who are practising it at home,” says Olupona.\n\nObservers say renewed reckonings over the legacies of colonialism may also prompt greater interest in precolonial cultural and spiritual practices. Nevertheless, those looking to reclaim their heritage face challenges. Most African spiritual belief systems are an oral tradition and are not recorded in writing.\n\n“There’s a lot that has been washed away,” says Mukuru, who has been exploring the Kikuyu cultural and spiritual history for several years.\n\nIf we lose these religions ... we would have lost an entire civilisation Jacob Olupona\n\nSome accounts on the Agīkūyū way of life were written by the Kikuyu historian Godfrey Muriuki and Louis Leakey, a Kenyan-British archaeologist who lived among the community for most of his life. Mukuru says a lot of the history can also be found in the community’s language, sayings, songs and stories by Kikuyu writers such as Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o.\n\nTraditional religions are also fiercely guarded by community elders and practitioners, say experts, adding that their oral form has allowed religions to evolve and incorporate beliefs from other religions.\n\nBut the efforts to revive traditional beliefs have not been welcomed in all quarters. Some members of the community, especially those over 50, strongly oppose the revival, says Mukuru’s teacher and spiritual guide, Kariithi wa Njenga. Many have embraced Christianity.\n\nKikuyu men and women dancing in traditional dress in Kenya’s former Central province, the Kikuyu heartland. Photograph: Images of Africa Photobank/Alamy\n\nThose who try to re-engage with the traditions, like Mukuru, also face some pressure to adopt it wholesale. She does not agree with some old Kikuyu traditions, such as female genital mutilation, for example. But she says the traditions entail a wide range of beliefs, including many that are progressive.\n\nUnder Kikuyu cultural practice, women had control over agricultural production, the community’s main source of livelihood. Mukuru says she was surprised to discover that the culture was also matrilineal and sexually liberal. “Sensual dances were used as a way to gauge sexual synergy with the opposite sex,” she says.\n\nEnvironmental protection was also an important part of the culture. “Treating animals and plants with respect is a mark of spiritual maturity among the Agīkūyū,” says Kanyi, adding that the community attached spiritual significance to mountains and trees, and observed a mainly plant-based diet.\n\nSuch spiritual practices are only held sacred by the community’s few practitioners. Experts say they have become custodians of an important history and culture. “If we lose these religions, it would be a big loss for the world,” says Olupona. “We would have lost an entire civilisation.”\n\nSign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:\n\nSign up for Global Dispatch – please check your spam folder for the confirmation email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
    "Kenya church service in memory of Queen": "A service to remember Queen Elizabeth II was held in a church in the Kenyan town of Naromoru in Nyeri county on Saturday.\n\nLike many other former British colonies, Kenya has a complicated relationship with the monarchy.\n\nThose living there are conflicted.\n\n\"We must celebrate her as a human being, mother and grandmother to her family but at the same time we must state that she has never acknowledged or apologised for the atrocities that were visited upon our parents and grandparents when they were demanding their freedom,\" said George Omuwe, a lawyer who attended the service.\n\nHe was referring to the Mau Mau rebellion against British colonial rule during which many Kenyans say they were beaten and sexually assaulted by officers acting for the British administration.\n\nSt. Philip's church is where the late Queen worshipped as a princess before ascending to the throne. In 2013, Kenya declared the church a national monument.\n\nThe Queen was head of state in Kenya from 1963 to 1964 when the country was an independent sovereign state, and visited on her honeymoon.",
    "Kenya App Allows Users to Help Track Rare Mammals": "Kenya's wildlife authorities have launched a free mobile phone app that allows users to track sightings of rare mammals to help authorities protect them.\n\nThe Mammal Atlas Kenya, or Makenya, allows any user who spots a wild mammal to identify it and log the location.\n\nKenya is home to nearly 400 species of mammals, 22 of them natives to regions of Kenya, according to national figures. Authorities say it is getting more difficult to protect them, as climate change and human activities take a toll on their natural habitats.\n\nSo the National Museums of Kenya, the Mammal Committee of Nature Kenya and partners designed the mobile app, which also provides a way to upload photographs and details, such as the number of mammals sighted and their exact locations.\n\n\"You can also add the behavior,\" said Dr. Simon Musila, a researcher at the National Museums of Kenya. \"When you see this animal, what are they doing? Are they resting? Are they running away? Are they feeding? What are they doing at the moment you see them?”\n\nMusila said it’s important to engage the public using technology to help the country’s limited number of mammal specialists. Wildlife authorities said staff would keep records of the animals’ changing environment and survival conditions.\n\nThere's a need \"to bring in many people who can contribute a lot of data,\" he said. \"These are people like safari guides. These are people like students, tourists, people who go out and come across animals and will be willing to submit data.\"\n\nSamson Onyuok uses the Makenya app. Users like him have reported more than 2,500 mammal sightings since the app launched in August.\n\n\"First, I think I take pride in contributing to conservation initiatives in the country,\" he said. \"I think as a Kenyan, that is my little way of contributing to the conservation initiatives. So, yes, there is a fulfillment that comes with that.\"\n\nExperts say Africa contributes minimally to climate change but is bearing the brunt of its consequences. Dr. Philip Muruthi, vice president of the African Wildlife Foundation, told VOA that reproduction of the rare mammals and the survival rate of young ones are dropping.\n\n\"It is very hard to benefit or manage what you don't know,\" he said. \"That is why this is so important. It is going to tell us which species we have, where they are, and maybe which ones are highly endangered, what we need to do about them. And especially not just the big things but also the small things, like the bats.\"\n\nWildlife officials say Kenya is a habitat to at least a third of mammal species in Africa and are hopeful app users will boost efforts to protect them.",

Backstory: In July, Kenya’s Asset Recovery Agency (ARA) got a court order to freeze 56 bank accounts which seven companies had used to launder Ksh 7 billion (~ $59.2 million). Of the seven companies, Flutterwave had about Ksh 6.7 billion frozen in 52 accounts from several banks including Guarantee Trust Bank, EcoBank, and Equity Bank. Later in August, the ARA received another order to freeze more accounts belonging to the fintech. The court froze funds worth Ksh 400.6 million ($3.3 million) across three banks including UBA, Access Bank, and Safaricom M-Pesa. And now? Well, about 2,468 investors say their money is part of the money frozen by the ARA in its pursuit of Flutterwave. Spokesperson Morris Ebitimi Joseph explained to Business Daily that they invested in a company called 86 Football Technology—also known as 86FB, 86Z, or 86W. The investors made deposits for an investment scheme that promised better returns which did not come to fruition. Investigations by the investors led them to believe that they had been swindled to the tune of Ksh 1.44 billion ($11 million) by a dubious person via transactions on Flutterwave. Now, they want Kenyan courts to separate Ksh 1.44 billion out of the frozen Ksh 6.7 billion released to them. “I believe that the issuance of an order compelling Guarantee Trust Bank, Equity Bank and Ecobank to deposit the sums excluded in the bank accounts of our advocates, justice shall be served to the 2,468 interested parties who were swindled of their hard-earned money through the scheme,” Ebitimi said. Zoom out: While the Central Bank of Kenya has accused Flutterwave of operating without a license, the fintech has maintained that it submitted an application for licensing back in 2019, citing the country’s notoriously long licensing process. Meanwhile, the ARA’s freeze order is valid only for 90 days as it gears up for its case against Flutterwave which is set to appear in court in November.\n\n\n\nSEND BY FLUTTERWAVE Don’t just send money, send money fast.

Last week, the DStv parent company announced its acquisition of Namola, an on-demand emergency response app. So, more choices for MultiChoice? Yup. MultiChoice South Africa CEO, Nyiko Shiburi, said “Namola is part of our strategy to expand our ecosystem beyond entertainment and to offer a suite of consumer services that meet the needs of our customers.” Namola describes itself as South Africa’s leading response solution “that allows all citizens get help fast”. On the app, users can get access to the public emergency services in South Africa including the police, fire service, ambulance and other community services. Its premium plan, Namola Plus, even allows users opt-in to receive help in emergency situations where they can’t reach or answer their phones. Namola’s individual plan costs R29 (2$) per month, the couples plan is R59 ($3.30), and the family package is R99 ($5.6) monthly. With MultiChoice’s acquisition, Namola will now be available to all DStv users—at extra cost, of course. From October 26, South African users can add the service to their bill. Big picture: MultiChoice has big plans for its future. Other than its recent acquisition of Namola, it also recently launched an internet service called DStv Internet, and it’s planning to launch its own smart TV called DStv Glass. MultiChoice Group CEO, Calvo Mawela, also announced last week that the company is looking to foray into fintech, although we might not be seeing that for a while.\n\n\n\nBAMBOO EXPANDS INTO GHANA Bamboo, one of Nigeria’s leading online brokerage firms, has expanded into Ghana, making it the first trans-national West African brokerage app. Through a partnership with 10th Capital Investments, a licensed Ghanaian firm, the more-than-50,000 users on Bamboo Ghana’s waitlist will now be able to buy and invest in stocks from US companies like Apple Inc and Tesla. When Bamboo raised a $15 million Series A round in January, its CEO announced that Ghana’s market was the company’s next frontier. Nine months and another $17.4 million raise later, the Ghana plans have become a reality. In a statement shared with TechCabal, Bamboo said it recently received a No Objection Letter from Ghana’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate in the country, enabling it to launch successfully. “We believe strongly that all Africans should earn a return on their investments and build intergenerational wealth. That’s why we created Bamboo: we wanted to create an easy and secure way for everyday Africans to invest in the US stock market, and eventually, in all types of asset classes,” said Richmond Bassey, Bamboo CEO and co-founder. Since its 2019 launch, Bamboo and other retail investment apps providing access to foreign securities like Chaka, Trove and Rise have had to deal with harsh regulatory conditions in their home country, Nigeria. In April last year, Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) labelled this category of companies as illegal and warned operators in the capital market to desist from operating with them. This was followed by Nigeria’s central bank describing Bamboo as unlicensed and freezing its bank accounts for a while. Despite the struggles, Bamboo has maintained its resolve to work “very closely with regulators in Nigeria” to ensure mutual satisfaction from both parties. Now in Ghana, Bamboo has committed to working with the country’s SEC on an ongoing basis to develop a standard regulatory framework for the retail investment industry Bamboo is pioneering. Through Bamboo’s US digital investing partner, DriveWealth LLC, the Nigeria-born company assures users that all accounts can claim insurance of up to $500,000 via the US Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). With regulations and insurance in place, Bamboo is ready to make retail investment a norm in Ghana. Albert Asiamah, 10th Capital Investments COO, was effusive about the performance of Bamboo’s product in Nigeria, describing the investment as ideal and beneficial. “We’re thrilled to work with [the Bamboo team] to bring Ghanaians the opportunity to invest in the US and eventually the local stock market. Their impeccable track record in Nigeria, stellar product and educational tools make them an ideal collaborator,” he said. “Together with Bamboo, we’ve been able to provide investors across Africa with affordable access to the US markets. Today, we’re thrilled to extend that same access to the people of Ghana,” said John Shammas, head of technical sales at DriveWealth. “As we continue our international expansion, we look forward to empowering more customers with the tools they need to improve their financial well-being and engage with the markets,” he added.\n\n\n\nSELL MORE WITH PAYSTACK Increase your online sales with a Paystack Storefront – a free, beautiful seller page that helps you bring creative ideas to life. 👉🏾 Learn more at paystack.com/storefront.

In Africa, its importance is extra critical as activities ranging from financial services to social commerce depend on its availability. Yet, internet speeds across many African countries are far below the global average. At 68.9 megabits per second (mbps), South Africa leads the continent in terms of internet speed, though it fell short of the 77.7mbps global average according to Ookla’s Speedtest Global Index. The effects are dire as it restricts young Africans from harnessing more opportunities in the global digital economy where reliable and fast internet remain key. While 3G and 4G internet services are largely available across the continent, they pale in comparison to the speed 5G internet brings. Currently, about 13 nations are testing 5G networks, with over 40 nations yet to lay down a foundation for the creation of 5G spectrums. The impact of the 5G internet is already obvious on the continent. According to Sylwia Kechiche, principal industry analyst, enterprise at Ookla, MTNSouth Africa performed better than its competitors on the continent as a result of the 5G technology. “We can clearly see the impact that 5G has on overall performance as South African operators came first thanks to having 5G networks in place. MTN South Africa was well ahead of the rest of operators, despite facing challenges with load shedding, with a median download speed of 65.95 mbps If we take 5G out of the equation, Safaricom Kenya was the fastest operator among the analyzed operators,” he said. While analysts predict that 5G will add $2.2 trillion to Africa’s economy by 2034, the transition doesn’t seem so smooth. Existing challenges include spectrum regulation clarity, commercial viability, deployment deadlines, and low citizen purchasing power of 5G enabled smartphones and expensive internet. To accelerate adoption of 5G technologies in Africa, African countries must develop clear and comprehensive frameworks for infrastructure deployment, use, regulation, and management. Spectrum pooling should be implemented to optimise the benefits of available spectrum and increase available bandwidths for mobile operators. Furthermore, spectrum trading should be pursued to enable cost-effective and efficient spectrum use to optimise the transfer of spectrum rights to users who require the 5G network spectrum the most, thereby lowering auction spectrum prices.

    "Saudi remittances to Kenya double to $187m amid maids abuse": "By CONSTANT MUNDA More by this Author\n\nSaudi Arabia has emerged as the fastest-growing source of remittances, pointing to increasing migration of jobless Kenyan workers despite cases of abuse and cruel treatment of foreign domestic workers in the Middle East nation.\n\nFresh official data — based on cash flows through formal channels — indicate that diaspora remittances from Saudi Arabia have more than doubled in the past two years.\n\nStatistics from the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) show Ksh22.65 billion ($187 million) was sent back home by Kenyans living in Saudi Arabia in the first eight months of the year.\n\nThis ranks the Gulf nation as the third-largest source of remittances for Kenya behind the United Kingdom (Ksh25.4 billion/ $209.8 million) and the United States (Ksh188.8 billion/ $1.5 billion).\n\nThe inflows have grown by three-quarters compared with $107.99 million in the same period last year, and represents a 144.35 percent climb over $77.26 million in 2020— marking the fastest growth over the period.\n\nSaudi Arabia relies on millions of low-paid foreign workers such as housemaids, care-givers, nannies, drivers and security guards, who send money to their families back home every year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore than 30 percent of the oil-rich kingdom’s population of 35 million are migrants, many from Asian and African countries.\n\nBut Saudi Arabia - like other Gulf nations such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman - has long faced criticism from rights groups for its visa-sponsorship system that leaves migrant workers open to abuse and exploitation.\n\nDomestic workers are often kept under lock and key by their employers, forced to work more than 18 hours a day, deprived of food and wages and physically and sexually abused, activists say.\n\nCBK data indicate the remittances from Saudi Arabia are on course to surpass cash wired from the UK, having overtaken South Africa that has been the second-largest source of money transfer from Kenyans working abroad. Foreign Affairs principal secretary Macharia Kamau told MPs that over 100,000 Kenyans engaged in non-domestic work in Saudi Arabia.\n\n“Countries like Saudi Arabia, their traditions around house work are very ‘ancient’ so you find people who suffer terrible beatings and abuse are usually house helps,” Mr Kamau said.\n\n“In that same country where we have over 100,000 Kenyans working in different capacities, hotels, taxis, they have no problem. So we have to ask ourselves if we are exporting the right category of personnel and do they have the right capacity and training to understand that culture.”\n\nVisa-sponsorship rules known as the kafala system in the Gulf countries tie migrant workers to their employer and they cannot change jobs or leave the country without permission.\n\nThis has led to widespread abuse of migrant workers -- from passport confiscation to unpaid wages and excessive work hours, beatings and even rape by male members of the household.\n\nKenyan authorities have come under intense pressure to put in place measures to protect citizens fleeing joblessness in an economy struggling to create jobs for its growing youthful population.\n\nIn the Ksh3.3 trillion ($27.2 billion) budget for this financial year ending June 2023, lawmakers approved a Ksh374 million ($3 million) expenditure to build a safe house in Saudi Arabia’s capital, Riyadh, to give refuge to Kenyan workers facing abuse in that country.\n\nDiaspora remittances from Saudi Arabia hit a monthly record of $26.6 million compared with $16.56 million in the same month last year and $10.43 million in August 2020.\n\nThat has cemented its place as the third-largest source of the cash sent back home by Kenyans abroad, behind the US and the UK whose inflows have been softening on the back of decades-high inflation which has eaten into earnings.\n\nInflows from Kenyans living in the US grew at a slower rate of 12.17 percent in the eight-month period to $1.565 billion, while the UK’s dropped 11.10 percent to Ksh25.44 billion ($210 million).\n\nOverall, remittances grew 11.44 percent year-over-year in the January-August 2022 period to $2.67 billion, consolidating its position as Kenya’s top forex earner ahead of tea exports, tourist receipts and horticultural exports.\n\nPresident William Ruto has pledged to create a ministry to address issues affecting Kenya’s diaspora when he forms government in the coming days.\n\n“The focus has been on remittances, while their fundamental rights as citizens have been neglected,” Dr Ruto said on September 13. “To correct this oversight, I pledge to elevate diaspora issues at a ministry level.”\n\n[email protected]",
    "Carter Center Report: Technology Helped Enhance Transparency of Kenyan Election; IEBC Should Ensure Earlier Preparations for 2027": "NAIROBI — The Carter Center today released the preliminary report from its expert mission to Kenya’s Aug. 9 presidential election, which focuses on the use of election technology and finds that significant progress was made in using technology to enhance the transparency and verifiability of the election process.\n\nThe Center commends the efforts of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission and Kenyan voters and calls on political leaders to encourage continued calm across the country and the peaceful transfer of power to the new government of President-elect William Ruto.\n\nIt notes that the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission worked in a challenging context that included inflammatory online attacks against IEBC officials by senior political figures and incidents of violence against its staff. Though the Center’s report is complimentary of the IEBC’s overall efforts, it also finds that the commission did not do enough to help voters better understand the role of election technologies in the run-up to the election. As such, it missed an opportunity to increase public confidence in the processes surrounding procurement, voter registration, voter verification, and equipment testing.\n\nLooking forward, the Center calls on the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to move quickly to conduct a full review of the 2022 vote so that preparations for the 2027 election can begin far in advance of the polls. It also calls on lawmakers, the media, and civil society to do everything possible to support the IEBC’s facilitation of these preparations.\n\nGiven its limited focus on technology, the Carter Center’s expert team did not seek to assess the overall conduct of voting, counting, and tabulation processes in the general election, nor to make a comprehensive assessment of the election process as a whole.\n\nThe Carter Center mission collaborated with Privacy International, which provided analysis on privacy issues around election technologies. The team’s work continues and will culminate in the publication of a final report, which will include a series of recommendations. Its work also will provide input for a forthcoming Carter Center handbook that will focus on international best practice for scrutinizing election technology in line with international standards, which will be a resource for the election observation and assistance community.\n\n###\n\nContact: In Atlanta, Soyia Ellison, soyia.ellison@cartercenter.org\n\nIn Nairobi, Ben Graham Jones, ben.jones@cartercenter.org\n\nWaging Peace.

    "Kenya has a new president after a more transparent — but still contentious — election": "Kenya has a new president after a more transparent — but still contentious — election\n\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:\n\nAfter a bruising election, Kenya has a new president. NPR's Eyder Peralta reports on what the transfer of power means for democracy.\n\nEYDER PERALTA, BYLINE: Just days ago, there were fears that President Uhuru Kenyatta wouldn't even show up at the stadium in Nairobi. But in front of thousands, Kenyatta handed a ceremonial sword to President-elect William Samoei Ruto. And just like that, two sworn enemies presided over a cordial, peaceful transfer of power.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT WILLIAM SAMOEI RUTO: William Samoei Ruto.\n\nPERALTA: This was a contentious election in Kenya. The country's longtime opposition alleged vast rigging, and both sides accused each other of bribing public officials. But this was also one of the most transparent elections. The electoral commission published raw results, and when the Supreme Court reviewed the electoral conduct, they found that the election was pretty much free, fair and credible. When they issued their judgment, the opposition leader reluctantly accepted. In his inaugural address, the newly minted President Ruto was conciliatory.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nRUTO: I will work with all Kenyans irrespective of who they voted for.\n\nPERALTA: In the past, elections in Kenya have erupted into violence. Now, elections seem routine, even boring. Analysts say it's a good thing.

    "Is Kenya ready to reintroduce the Shamba System?": "A view of Mt Elgon Forest. [Caroline Chebet, Standard]\n\nDeputy President Rigathi Gachagua's proposal to revert to the Shamba system has sparked debate on whether Kenya is ready for the re-introduction of the system that was banned twice by different regimes.\n\nSpeaking on Saturday, in Baringo County, Gachagua hinted that the government has plans to allow peasant farmers to carry out farming in forests to boost food production in the country.\n\n\"There was Shamba System where locals could plant maize until the trees grow. This government is yours, we have made an order for Wananchi to be given an opportunity to cultivate in the forest to have more food,\" Gachagua said.\n\nHow the Shamba system worked\n\nThe agroforestry approach started way back in 1910 under tolonial rule to promote sustained and optimum production of food crops while assisting forest conservation. Under the system, agricultural crops are grown together with the forest trees.\n\nDuring the Moi administration, the system was aligned and locals would cooperate with officials from the Kenya Forest Service in matters allocation of land (mostly not more than an acre for each family).\n\nAfter allocation, the had grown after around three years, the beneficiaries would hand back the land to the Kenya Forest officials.\n\nBack then, the main aim was to afforest land where exotic trees had been cut for timber and as well as boost the food supply chain across the country.\n\nAmong the crops that were grown included; maize, beans, groundnuts, potatoes, onions and tomatoes. At the same time, those allocated the land would be allowed to harvest firewood, forest fruits and even keep beehives.\n\nWhy it was successful\n\nFrom the onset, the Shamba System was successful because at its introduction stage, the government through the Kenya Forest docket had designated personnel who worked hand in hand with farmers on a weekly basis.\n\nWith this in place, the farmer could be guided on what to plant and what not to during what season plus kinds of trees to plant and when to harvest.\n\nThe officers were also in charge of plot acquisition hence ensuring that only those with good intentions were vetted and allocated.\n\nHowever, it was later banned under the late Mwai Kibaki;s era, after it emerged that most farmers refused to move out of their allocated plots after the three-year period given elapsed and had cut down the trees.\n\nAnother major reason that led to the Kibaki-led government to abolish the Shamba System was logging, where rogue millers would collaborate with some Kenya Forest Service officials to cut trees for personal benefits.",
    "Why US tech billionaire took up job as ambassador to Kenya": "By Mike Owuor More by this Author\n\nBy Elvis Ondieki More by this Author\n\nWhen United States President Joe Biden announced the nomination of Margaret “Meg” Whitman as the Ambassador to Kenya last December, one question must have lingered in many minds across the world: why would a Silicon Valley billionaire with a storied career as a corporate executive and board member of some of the world’s top multinationals take up this role?\n\nIt was an inevitable introductory question as the Sunday Nation team settled down for an exclusive interview with Ms Whitman—the first since her arrival last month—at the American embassy in Nairobi.\n\nPerhaps undergirded by decades of experience as a corporate leader and awareness of her new role as a diplomat, 66-year-old Ms Whitman calmly tackles even the most uncomfortable of questions and has a vivid recollection of events, people and places. She speaks with authority and dresses the part.\n\nHer real-time net worth on Forbes is indicated as $3.1 billion (Sh373 billion), ranking her among the richest women in the United States.\n\nForbes data indicate that in 2021, the year she was nominated to be the ambassador to Kenya, her peak net worth was $5.8 billion. This usually fluctuates depending on various factors, including stock markets.\n\nBack to the question: What convinced the billionaire, most known for steering multinational e-Commerce giant eBay to astronomical growth and for leading Hewlett-Packard among other high-profile corporate positions, to take up a US government job in Nairobi?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInfluential global role\n\n“So, I was called by the President of the United States (President Joe Biden) and he asked whether I would be willing to be an ambassador. And the next sentence was, ‘We want you to go to Kenya.’ And I said, ‘Okay, tell me why. Tell me more’,” she says.\n\nMs Whitman says that in her conversation with President Biden, he explained the influential global role Africa would play in the next decades, especially given its burgeoning population.\n\n“And he said, ‘Kenya is one of the most important countries in Africa, and so I’d really like you to take up a post there. The other thing that I think would be a good fit for you and the United States is that Kenya is the East Africa leader in technology; with Safaricom, M-Pesa (a mobile money service) and the start-up community’,” says Ms Whitman, who has been inducted to the US Business Hall of Fame.\n\nIn picking her, the president believed that having an American ambassador with such vast experience, especially in technology—given Kenya’s prominent role on the continent—would be important.\n\nShe told the President: “Okay, I’m game.”\n\nBut being a daughter, wife, mother and grandmother, it was not a decision she would make on her own. So, what did those closest to her think about this? Throughout the interview, the significance of her family, especially in some of the most important decisions in her personal and professional career, stands out.\n\nHer two sons—Griff Harsh and Will Harsh —encouraged her to take up the ambassadorial job because “life is about experiences and we think it would be a great experience.” It did not matter that she had never been a diplomat before and her husband, Dr Griffith R Harsh, a renowned neurosurgeon in the United States, decided to come with her to Nairobi.\n\n“As it turns out, American medical licences are good in just three countries outside the US. Kenya is one of them. And so, he is now trying to decide what he will do as he gets settled in Kenya,” she tells Sunday Nation about a man whose unwavering support alongside that of her mother is acknowledged throughout Ms Whitman’s book, The Power of Many.\n\nShe goes on: “It turns out that households don’t run themselves. And so, just getting the household set up, learning how to use M-Pesa, understanding how we get around and where to go, I have had no time. So, that has fallen to him.”\n\nBesides, Ms Whitman had to resign from the board of General Motors, Procter & Gamble, and Teach for America among others, to satisfy the requirements for her appointment. Ambassadorial duties, she says, require the relinquishing of all such positions.\n\nRead: Joe Biden nominates ex-HP boss as US ambassador to Kenya\n\nEven though she had been to Kenya before in 2018 during a two-week visit that also included travelling to Tanzania as a member of the board of trustees of The Nature Conservancy, a US-headquartered global environmental organisation, this time it was different.\n\nMs Whitman’s nomination was considered by the US Senate and confirmed on July 14 this year. She came to Kenya on August 1 to take over from Kyle McCarter. It was not until August 5 that President Uhuru Kenyatta, whose term ended this month, received her credentials. Significantly, it was just four days to one of Kenya’s most closely contested elections.\n\nTake on general election\n\nWith that, she was thrust headlong into the General Election. She admits that she had been researching a lot about Kenyan politics, but a lot was new. Ms Whitman’s conclusion is that the election was “remarkable”.\n\n“Democracy has prevailed here,” she says. “The outcome was ultimately contested, but in an appropriate, non-violent way—right to the Supreme Court that adjudicated and the candidates accepted the results. And I think it was a shining moment for Kenya.”\n\nShe goes on: “Kenyans should be very proud of the process that took place here. It was, I think, a model even for East Africa and all of Africa and, frankly, a model for the world.”\n\nShe was an observer on Election Day and her experience at Nairobi Primary School is stuck in her mind. She marvelled at the calmness and organisation of the voting—though she thought the ballot papers were “very long and many ”.\n\nMs Whitman says that the US had no preferred candidate in the election: “The US was very clear that this was a Kenyan election by Kenyans for Kenyans. We are here only to be supportive if we can be in terms of transparency and as election observers. But we did not have a preferred candidate.”\n\nNonetheless, there appear to have been shuttle diplomacy by Western envoys during the post-election period. On August 18, for example, Ms Whitman was in a team that included Delaware Senator Chris Coons, which separately met with Mr Kenyatta, Kenya Kwanza Alliance’s William Ruto (then President-elect) and Mr Raila Odinga of Azimio La Umoja-One Kenya Coalition Party.\n\nWhat was this all about? She says Mr Coons was the reason the meetings happened.\n\n“As you probably know, Senator Coons has a long history with Africa and a long history in Kenya. He did his first year of college at the University of Nairobi. And he speaks quite fluent Swahili.\n\n“So, he knew all three (Mr Kenyatta, Mr Ruto and Mr Odinga) and he actually arranged these meetings. They (the neetings) were really about checking in with his friends and talking about where we were in the election and encouraging what was already underway—which was a peaceful resolution to the challenge at the Supreme Court,” says Ms Whitman.\n\nBut did the US and other global powers fear Mr Kenyatta would cling to power and frustrate a peaceful transition? The envoy says she never had such doubts, given her interactions with him.\n\n“I would say we were quite confident,” she says. “When I met with President Kenyatta as I presented my credentials, I said, ‘I have every confidence that this election will go as you all hope it will: violence-free, a peaceful transfer of power.’ And that’s exactly what happened. And I, in the US embassy, had confidence that this would go smoothly. And it did.”\n\nVisa backlog\n\nMs Whitman’s management style celebrates competence and teamwork. Early in her tenure, she has had to confront some long-standing challenges at the embassy that she says she is confident she will resolve.\n\nThe backlog in handling visa applications of Kenyans has resulted in long waiting times, and has been top on her agenda after complaints from those who had been forced to reschedule or cancel their travel plans.\n\nAs part of the efforts to streamline operations, the American embassy recently waived interview requirements for some categories of visa renewal applications. She says she recently spent a few hours working with the teams processing the visas and, after some training, helped to take applicants’ fingerprints.\n\n“I’m not trained to do the interviews (like the consular officials) but anyone can do finger-printing,” she says, laughing.\n\nThe embassy now has a new “very experienced” consul-general, she says, and the ambassador hopes that the appointment, plus the recent repeal of a requirement for visa interviews for some categories, will eventually help clear the backlog and improve the US visa application experience.\n\nIf she still sticks to her worldview when she wrote her 2010 book, The Power of Many, she will be slow on parties and showy treats for embassy staff. While emerging tech companies indulged in parties, she writes, eBay was focused on spending only on the necessities and paying its staff well.\n\n“Beyond vetoing fluff and excess, I was determined to make sure eBay remained a lean, efficient company in other ways, too,” she wrote.\n\nSo what drove her as a pioneer woman corporate executive often breaking the proverbial glass ceiling?\n\nBecause of her career choices, Ms Whitman has at times worked in set-ups where she was the only woman in the room, but she is grateful for the mentorship from her mother and her early workplace influences for building in her the spirit to fight on.\n\n“From the earliest day, my mother told my brother, my sister and me: ‘You can do anything you want.’ And I amazingly believed her. There was no reason to believe her, but she was very persuasive and confident. And she said, ‘Don’t let people tell you you can’t do it. You figure it out,’” says Ms Whitman.\n\nShe adds; “I landed the US ambassador job. I’m not a career diplomat. I’ve never done this before. So, at first, you’re thinking, ‘Hmm, how am I going to do this?’ And then you figure it out. And so, my advice to men and women is: Give yourself a little latitude to figure it out.”\n\nAmerica has previously sent some colourful and controversial envoys to Nairobi, so what should Kenya expect during her term? She says democracy and transparency remain important and she will also focus on economic development—particularly small and medium enterprises.\n\n“How to take this digital environment and make it work for small- to medium businesses is a real passion of mine,” she says, saluting President Ruto for also focusing on enterprise in his manifesto.\n\n“What Kenyans have to build on are things like the penetration of M-Pesa. I’m not sure that Kenyans realise how impressive this is. In Silicon Valley, we all knew about M-Pesa and were amazed at the penetration and how it had lifted people out of poverty and now everyone in Kenya is banked,” says Ms Whitman.\n\nHer assessment of Kenya’s technology scene is that it is at its infancy but has tremendous potential.\n\n“I think it’s very vibrant, but maybe at the beginning of the cycle,” she says. “What you need to create an even more vibrant tech scene is some large companies: Safaricom, now Google is here, Microsoft,among others. What they are doing is bringing in young tech workers and training them.”\n\nSuch an environment with many skilled people helps create start-ups.\n\n“Then you need an investment community: venture capital. And venture capital is alive and well in Kenya. In fact, if you adjust for the size of GDP of the country, Kenya has the biggest venture capital sector on the continent of Africa,” she says.\n\nMs Whitman emphasises the importance of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem) for long-term gains.\n\n“You need some very good universities who are training computer scientists, mechanical engineers, civil engineers in Stem. I would encourage the leading universities here to think about investing in training more Stem students,” she says.\n\nMs Whitman, who is often listed as one of the most influential women in the world, particularly points out that “unless girls major in Stem and go through high school with a good maths and science background, you’re not going to have the women to take the jobs in technology.”\n\nFood security\n\nDuring her tenure in Kenya, she says she will also focus on food security. Ms Whitman is perturbed by the humanitarian crisis caused by the drought in north-eastern Kenya and the Horn of Africa that is “perhaps the largest in the world right now”.\n\nShe says she will also put emphasis on conservation.\n\n“What Kenya has done around community conservancies is extraordinary. You know, the national parks, I think, comprise around two to three per cent of Kenyan lands. If you add all the community conservancies, it could go up to 12 per cent of Kenya—and I am being conservative. And, obviously, tourism is a big source of foreign exchange and a big part of the economy,” she says.\n\nSpeaking of the economy, it is widely acknowledged that Kenya-US trade relations are lopsided in favour of the superpower. The trade window facilitated by Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa) has been among the key areas to bridge that gap. It first opened in 2000 and extended in 2015, but stares at an uncertain future when it expires in 2025.\n\n“Kenya has benefitted, I think quite dramatically, under Agoa. They are one of the biggest beneficiaries of Agoa, particularly in apparel exports. We have seen apparel exports from Kenya to the US go up dramatically in the context of Agoa,” she says, hoping that there will be conversations about maintaining this momentum.\n\nInvestment Partnership\n\nThere is also the USA-Kenya Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations that started during the tenure of former President Donald Trump. Ms Whitman says the FTA has been binned by the Biden administration in favour of the United States-Kenya Strategic Trade and Investment Partnership (STIP) launched in July.\n\nWhile Mr Trump wanted to negotiate a bilateral trade deal, the STIP was described as “the new roadmap” to support African regional economic integration.\n\n“When new administrations come in, sometimes policies change. And so, what we now have in place is the United States-Kenya Strategic Trade and Investment Partnership that was negotiated by our United States trade representative and (Trade Cabinet Secretary) Betty Maina in the Kenyan government. And this is an important first step to ultimately perhaps even more cooperation,” says Ms Whitman.\n\nShe adds: “One of the things that I’d very much like to see is exports from Kenya to the US improve significantly. It’s important for Kenya because of the foreign exchange reserves and the opportunity for American companies to import to Kenya.”\n\nDuring Mr Kenyatta’s administration from 2013, and his predecessor Mwai Kibaki since 2003, there has been a rise in Chinese investments and trade with the Asian giant. Chinese firms, mostly state-backed, have been involved in various mega projects, including construction of the Standard Gauge Railway and the Nairobi Expressway. Is the US worried about China’s growing influence?\n\n“Secretary [of State Antony] Blinken was very clear when he was here in October 2021 that we didn’t want to say to Kenyans ‘you can’t do business with China’ but give Kenyans an opportunity to do more business with Americans. And so, we definitely are interested in making sure there is a level playing field for American companies and making sure that American companies understand the opportunity in Kenya,’” she says.\n\nMs Whitman notes: “I was the CEO of a Fortune 50 company. And I think many big American companies don’t understand the opportunity in Kenya. When you sit in America, you are thinking about Asia, Europe, Latin America – because they are so close to us – but the opportunity in Africa and in Kenya is great.”\n\nThe American embassy has also been under fire for its travel advisories over the years. Under Ms Whitman, two that warned American citizens against travelling to Kisumu on key dates around the presidential election—the announcement of the results and the Supreme Court verdict—have stirred debate.\n\n“Our first job as the embassy and [for me] as the US ambassador is to make sure that Americans and embassy personnel are safe. And this is true not only for Kenya but for every country in the world: safety of Americans and embassy personnel is number one. We had no information that you didn’t have, but our second biggest installation outside of Nairobi is Kisumu,” she says, adding that the precaution could have been informed by “some violence in previous elections”.\n\nSays Ms Whitman: “I have no real latitude about whether to issue those warnings or not. They are really required by the United States government in these kinds of circumstances. Fortunately, Kisumu was perfect. There was no violence there, and so we were happy about that.”\n\nUS Supreme Court\n\nShe explains that even though she did not have a lot of latitude on the decision to issue those warnings, “as we go forward, we’ll try to think about these as carefully as we can.”\n\nWe held the interview three months after the US Supreme Court overturned the Roe v Wade judgment, effectively removing many liberties for women on abortion. Will that affect the US government’s funding of reproductive health rights in Kenya? Ms Whitman says a categorical “no”.\n\n“President Biden has been very clear that in the US, he will continue to support women’s rights to choose,” says Ms Whitman. “The State Department and the mission in Nairobi will not change policies on that.”\n\nPresidential ambition?\n\nHaving been previously listed by some publications as one of the people most likely to be America’s first woman president, she is categorical during our interview that she would not consider getting into the race for the White House.\n\n“I ran for governor of California (in 2010). As you know, I lost [to Jerry Brown]. And I sort of did my turn at elective politics. So, you will not see me run again,” she says.\n\nMs Whitman has visited a few places outside Nairobi, most recently Kisumu, but hopes to travel more. And true to her love for the outdoors, she has already been to Ngong Hills and Mt Longonot for a hike. She has also visited the Amboseli National Park and the Maasai Mara.\n\n“But that’s just the beginning of my travel. I want to get out to places beyond Nairobi. Nairobi is very important, but I want to make sure I get out to towns and villages across Kenya.”\n\nWe had to wind up our interview exactly when our scheduled hour with her ran out. She was rushing to address a gathering of women in technology hosted by the embassy.\n\nDorcas Odumbe contributed to this article with additional interview questions\n\n[email protected]",
    "Al-Shabab Militants Issue New Threats Against Kenya": "Somali-based, al-Qaida-affiliated Islamist militant group al-Shabab has issued a new threat against neighboring Kenya. The group said it will continue its attacks in that country as long as Kenyan troops are in Somalia.\n\nAl-Shabab said in an English-language statement Saturday it will continue to target Kenyan towns and cities until Kenyan troops are out of Somalia.\n\nIt said that if the Kenyan government continues to maintain its “invasion” of Muslim lands it will continue to strike inside Kenya.\n\n“Know that we will continue to defend our lands and our people from the aggressive Kenyan invasion. We will continue to concentrate our attacks on Kenyan towns and cities as long as Kenyan forces continue to occupy our Muslim lands,” the group said.\n\nOmar Mahmood, an International Crisis Group senior analyst for Eastern Africa discussed the situation with VOA via WhatsApp.\n\n“Generally, al-Shabab remains a threat to Kenya, both from infiltration across the border and terrorist attacks in other parts of the country. So, they will continue trying to target Kenya if they don't get what they want, which at its core is the end of a Kenyan military operation in Somalia,” he said.\n\nMohamed Husein Gaas, director of the Raad Peace Research Institute based in Mogadishu, told VOA by phone that al-Shabab threats are real, as they have seen the organization become stronger financially in the last few years, despite the presence of African Union forces in Somalia.\n\n“The region's increased insecurity due to the ongoing civil war in Ethiopia and the underlying political and social polarization will likely exasperate the insecurity of the region as a whole,” he said.\n\nHe said the group also may have also become more oriented toward outward expansion, as signaled by the recent attack on Ethiopia’s Somali state.\n\nAl-Shabab has been fighting Somali government and AU peacekeeping operations in the country more than 15 years.",

FILE PHOTO | NMG\n\nBy JOSEPH WANGUI\n\nMore by this Author\n\nA judge has dismissed a petition from the Kenya Pipeline Company (KPC) to lift orders that stopped a disciplinary process against the head of internal audit at the parastatal over claims that the auditor overstated work experience entry in her curriculum vitae.\n\nJustice Jacob Gakeri dismissed a request from KPC to quash earlier court orders that stopped the firm from punishing General Manager Internal Audit, Catherine Kaloki, on allegations she overstated her work experience in her resume.\n\nMs Kaloki reckons that she had six-year work experience in senior audit roles ahead of applying for the KPC job.\n\nBut the firm, with the backing of the Auditor General, says she had a work experience of four-and-a-half years and four months in breach of the job requirement that required a five-year experience.\n\nALSO READ: New president faces hurdles in replacing parastatal CEOs\n\nThe suit emerges at a time a long line of executives has been ensnared in controversies over inaccurate CVs in disclosures have hastened the exit of some.\n\nKPC wanted the Labour Relations Court to set aside the injunctive interim orders dated April 12, 2022, on grounds that they were irregularly obtained and that Ms Kaloki moved to court prematurely.\n\nThe State-owned energy company added that the court orders were oppressive and that they were obtained as a result of Ms Kaloki's non-disclosure that she deliberately misled KPC on her qualifications.\n\nJustice Gakeri dismissed the request, saying Ms Kaloki had established a case for the court's intervention in the ongoing disciplinary process because of how the exercise was being undertaken by KPC.\n\nFor instance, the court stated that her request for documents relevant to her defence was rebuffed by the KPC managing director.\n\nThe court said Ms Kaloki was preparing a defence and was entitled to the documents whether the KPC boss considered them irrelevant or not.\n\n\"Allowing it (disciplinary process) to proceed to conclusion in its present structure is likely to occasion grave injustice to the petitioner and cannot withstand scrutiny.\n\nThe procedure violates the Constitution, Fair Administrative Action Act, Employment Act and the Respondent/Applicant’s Human Resource Manual,\" said the judge.\n\nHe also dismissed allegations that Ms Kaloki obtained the orders on account of non-disclosure of material facts related to the work experience.\n\nMs Kaloki was hired by the State agency in October 2021 and the disciplinary action started in March 2022, more than one year after her employment.\n\nKPC kicked off the disciplinary process after establishing Ms Kaloki had not met the set work experience of five years as a principal internal auditor.\n\nALSO READ: Ex-KPC boss Komen faces jail on failure to pay lawyer Sh5.2m\n\nThe agency said she overstated her work experience in the resume and during the interview for the job.\n\nBut Ms Kaloki said after applying for the position of General Manager of Internal Audit in September 2020 she disclosed all the information relating to her work experience.\n\nShe also presented all testimonials from former employers in the presence of officers from the Public Service Commission and did not receive any objection.\n\nAt the time she was an employee of the Kenya Bureau of Standards (Kebs).\n\nMs Kaloki contended that she did not falsify any documents or make any false declarations and that she had the required experience for the job.\n\nMs Kaloki said she had experience of six years at the time. She had furnished KPC with all original certificates and testimonials, including a letter of promotion from Kebs that accounted for four years, four months experience as a principal.\n\nShe had also worked as Regional Manager at the National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) for one year and half, arguing that the postings earned her six years work experience.\n\nShe stated that KPC had subjected her to several incidents of harassment and mistreatment such as being publicly instructed to stop attending executive meetings.\n\nMs Kaloki also denied feigning sickness on April 6, 2022, with a view to procuring the court orders against the disciplinary process.\n\nHer troubles started in early 2022 when KPC received the draft Management Letter from the Office of the Auditor General for audit for the year ended June 30, 2021.\n\nALSO READ: Kenya’s biggest court awards\n\nThe letter queried the recruitment of the General Manager-Human Resource and General Manager-Internal Audit (Ms Kaloki) and marked their hiring as irregular and breached KPC's Human Resource Policies and Procedures.\n\nIn addition, the letter stated that Ms Kaloki had not attained the required five-year experience for the top management role and that the recruitment had not been sanctioned by the Treasury.\n\nThe letter jolted the KPC managing director Macharia Irungu into action.\n\nIn a letter dated March 2, 2022, the MD gave her 72 hours to explain in writing, by March 9, her CV and responsibilities in her previous employment.\n\nShe indicated that she worked for Kebs as Principal Internal Auditor 2008-2020, and National Cereals and Produce Board Regional Auditor 2007 – 2008.\n\nThe CV on the other hand stated that from 2008 to the time she was applying for the KPC job, she was Principal Internal Auditor at Kebs while between 2007–2008 she was Regional Auditor at the NCPB.\n\n[email protected]",

According to him, he has the numbers since his side won the Speaker position in both Houses.\n\n“I have heard them [Odinga’s coalition] try to say they have some numbers. If you cannot even raise a candidate for the Speaker of the Senate what numbers do you really have?” he said to Kenya Kwanza lawmakers during a coalition retreat.\n\nWith Kenya Kwanza MPs during the interrogation of our Manifesto at the ongoing Parliamentary Group meeting in Naivasha, Nakuru County. pic.twitter.com/mDauJgS7FC — William Samoei Ruto, PhD (@WilliamsRuto) September 17, 2022\n\nA week ago, Ruto’s candidate, Moses Wetangula, won the National Assembly Speaker’s race against Raila’s ally Kenneth Marende. In the Senate race, Azimio la Umoja did not participate citing fraud during the election process.\n\nOn the other hand, Martha Karua, who was Raila’s running mate in the August polls, maintains that her coalition is the majority party, and thus deserves to lead the House business.\n\n“We are the largest party in Parliament, we deserve to have the majority leader ,” she told the Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya Coalition parliamentary group meeting.\n\nREAD MORE Kenya: The Martha Karua euphoria that never was\n\nKalonzo Musyoka, another coalition leader, echoed Karua’s sentiments saying: “For the avoidance of doubt the AZIMIO-OKA coalition party is legally and legitimately the majority coalition in the National Assembly.”\n\nEarlier today, we convened Azimio Legislators' meeting with @RailaOdinga.

According to the Political Parties Act of 2011, a political party can only enter into a new coalition agreement after formally exiting an existing one.\n\nThe fight between the two coalitions is aimed at taking control of Parliamentary business as this is what shapes policies and critical decisions that affect Kenyan citizens in terms of economy, health, education, trade, among others.\n\nWho will solve this stalemate ?\n\nWith both sides standing their ground, Wetangula, who is from Ruto’s coalition, has a duty – as National Assembly Speaker – to determine which side has a majority.\n\nWetangula, who met both leaders, says although he is a member of the Kenya Kwanza coalition, he will arbitrate on the matter fairly.\n\n“I’m an impartial arbiter.

    "Wash-wash: Jitters as Kenya set to know its fate on money laundering controls": "Kenya's broken systems breed wash-wash cons. [Wilberforce Okwiri, Standard]\n\nKenya faces an acid test in the next two months on the status of reforms to strengthen anti-money laundering controls with the global dirty money watchdog expected to release its scorecard for the country.\n\nThe looming report backed by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) will either place or exclude Kenya in an infamous grey list for its efforts or lack of in fighting money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nInclusion in a ‘grey’ watchlist by the Paris-based agency, could risk reputational damage to Kenya which is East Africa’s largest economy and business hub which may hurt foreign investment.\n\nThe agency’s regular reports and assessments usually group countries from the United States to China based on their responses to tackle financial crime.\n\nThe assessments usually highlight a series of failings or successes, including lack of or adequate control of those who handle large sums of money.\n\nThe report is supported by the Eastern and Southern Africa Anti-Money Laundering Group (ESAAMLG) of which Kenya is a member of and whose role is to combat money laundering by implementing the FATF Recommendations.\n\n“Kenya has been undergoing a mutual evaluation led by FATF regional partner ESAAMLG, which is in the final stages and assesses the strengths and weaknesses of Kenya’s anti-money laundering (AML) and counter financing of terrorist (CFT) system,” said the FATF in response to queries by Financial Standard.\n\nBroadly, the result of being added to the grey list is that it will increase the cost of doing business for local companies with foreign trading partners.\n\nFor instance, a Kenyan multinational now doing business in European or American markets would have to provide detailed information on its activities to banks there and its procedures to mitigate possible money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nThe specific implications of this are that global correspondent banks and other intermediary financial institutions involved in transactions with Kenyan entities are likely to demand a higher level of due diligence.\n\nAnalysts said this year’s assessment is crucial at a time Kenya is clamouring to ease decade-old rules for transacting in large cash risking the wrath of the global dirty money watchdog.\n\nPresident William Ruto has said that he wants the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) to relax the rules for reporting transactions beyond Sh1 million.\n\nThe rules fall under the Proceeds Of Crime And Anti-Money Laundering Act (the POCAMLA) which is the key enactment which supports the AML legal framework in Kenya.\n\nThe CBK has been hesitant to implement a similar order given by retired President Uhuru Kenyatta citing money laundering concerns and breach of international obligations.\n\nCBK governor Patrick Njoroge recently reiterated that any fresh review would not lose sight of Kenya’s international obligations adding that Kenya is committed to meeting international standards on anti-money laundering.\n\nDr Njoroge maintained that banks should refer to a history of regular cash transactions in flagging suspicious deals so that they do not subject customers to questions on the source and use of the cash every time they visit banking halls. CBK Governor Patrick Njoroge. [File, Standard]\n\nThis came as the FATF which is said to be watching Kenya on its latest plans refused to be drawn into the possible implications of easing rules on large cash transactions.\n\n“The FATF cannot comment on planned legislation or legislative changes outside of the framework of a mutual evaluation or follow-up process,” said the global agency in response to questions by The Standard.\n\nA previous report welcomed Kenya’s efforts but warned that lawyers and certified public secretaries were not captured as\n\nreporting persons under the POCAMLA obligations.\n\nPresident Ruto recently asked the CBK to implement the order without further delay citing ongoing hindrances to small businesses.\n\n“In our engagements, traders also complained about the onerous burden involved in cash transactions exceeding Sh1million,” he said recently, adding that many traders have reverted to storing money under their mattresses at great risk, which is clearly not the intention of the anti-money laundering regulations.\n\nChapter 231 of the Constitution says the CBK “shall not be under the direction or control of any person or authority in the exercise of its powers or the performance of its functions.”\n\n“While we remain fully committed to mitigating this risk, we believe that there is scope to make compliance less burdensome on genuine business transactions,” he said.\n\n“I have been assured by the Central Bank that work on how to ease this burden without compromising the security of the financial system is underway.”\n\nRetired President Kenyatta last October issued a directive to raise the limit of suspicious cash transactions commercial lenders are required to report under anti-money laundering laws to facilitate cash deals among traders.\n\nUhuru had ordered the immediate raise of the reporting limit for both deposits and withdrawals above the current Sh1 million, without saying what the new figure will be.\n\nLenders earlier said they were waiting for the CBK’s nod to raise the threshold for reporting transactions beyond the Sh1 million.\n\nThe law mandates financial institutions to keep records of cash transactions of more than Sh1 million and report suspicious deals to the FRC. Central Bank of Kenya (CBK). [File, Standard]\n\nInsiders say banks would benefit from the increase in the threshold for reporting but the regulator is hesitant as it would breach some international obligations.\n\nThe CBK issued a circular in 2016 reminding banks not to relent on prudential disclosures. Business people have complained that the cash limit has hindered their ability to carry out smooth transactions.\n\nThe law requires financial institutions to keep records of cash transactions of more than Sh1 million and report suspicious deals to the Financial Reporting Centre (FRC) – the agency operationalised in April 2012 and tasked with identifying and combating money laundering and financing of terrorism.\n\nBusinesses and individuals transacting more than Sh1 million are required to declare to their bankers why the money cannot be deposited or withdrawn through electronic means under the Kenya Electronic Payments and Settlement System and Real-Time Gross Payment System (KEPSS/RTGS).\n\nThe disclosures include the source of the cash, how it will be spent, who are direct and indirect beneficiaries as well as the full identity of the intended beneficiaries.\n\nThe global dirty money watchdog evaluates countries on 40 recommendations that should be in place to combat illicit financial flows.\n\nKenya recently launched its international financial centre in the capital after years of preparation to attract large foreign firms and boost capital flows.\n\nThe Kenyan hub is expected to model Nairobi as a financial district in line with existing financial centres in European, Middle East and the Far East capitals such as London, Dubai and Hong Kong.\n\nDespite Kenya’s relatively developed capital markets, 75 per cent of all business financing in the economy was from the banking sector, while the balance came from the capital markets, the Treasury said earlier, adding that the situation was not ideal.",

    "Kenya: As Drought Deepens Land Conflicts, Peacebuilders Respond": "Amid lengthening droughts in a changing climate, millions of herders in northern Kenya are watching their traditional grazing lands dry and harden. As in pastoralist regions from Mongolia to the Sahel, Kenyan herders are now guiding their cattle, camels, sheep or goats longer distances in search of pasturage. The competition for scarcer grassland and water has triggered conflicts and bloodshed among herding communities. But at the grass roots of northern Kenyan society, activists are combining local knowledge and peacebuilding skills to create new ways for rival groups to cooperatively adapt to the changes from a degrading climate.\n\nIn Laikipia, a wide plateau of rolling savannah and forests, local organizers like Ramson Karmushu are building a network of environmental peacebuilders who are helping their herding communities — Maasai, Samburu, Rendile, Borana and Turkana — cooperate for survival. Karmushu, 31, is an ethnic Maasai from a sub-tribe called Il-Ngwesi. As a boy he herded his family’s cattle for months at a time, camping in the region’s dry forestlands — and he later trained as a tour guide for the region’s wildlife conservancies. But witnessing the violence in his region, Karmushu has been working for years with a local peacebuilding group, the Indigenous Movement for Peace Advancement and Conflict Transformation (IMPACT).\n\n“In northern Kenya, we come from many different communities that all practice pastoralism and that all face similar challenges,” Karmushu said in an interview, “but we will not be able to solve these issues — of climate change, the loss of our grazing lands and having a future for our people — unless we can solve our conflicts peacefully and be united.”\n\nCommunities’ new desperation from drought intensifies old land disputes reaching back to Kenya’s colonization by Britain. Much as in the Americas and Australia, the European colonists took the most desirable lands, using disputed treaties and armed force to drive indigenous peoples to less fertile regions. British settlers flocked to Laikipia’s high-altitude climate, building farms, ranches and towns in what became known as Kenya’s “White Highlands.” After independence in 1963, many, but not all, white landowners left, and Kenya’s government distributed their holdings in ways that deepened Laikipia’s economic inequities. Thus, generations of land seizures shuffled ethnic communities over the landscape and left many groups marginalized.\n\nClimate, Economic Changes Sharpen Disputes\n\nAs in many areas where land use causes conflicts — Somalia, South Sudan and others — Laikipia’s generations-old disputes are intensified not only by drought but by more sophisticated weaponry, communications and transportation. “Climate change is degrading areas of land and forcing pastoralists to move long distances in search of pasture,” Karmushu said. “Communities in conflicts can more easily get weapons, more powerful ones than before. And mobile phones and motorbikes are making it easier” for rival groups “to conduct larger, more deadly attacks and then escape quickly,” thus complicating efforts to establish responsibility for an act of violence.\n\nAlso, “when people fight, others take advantage,” Karmushu said. “Politicians may use the conflict to seek influence, and businesses or criminals may use it to make money.” Increasingly, Karmushu said, northern Kenya’s “conflicts are being commercialized. In traditional conflicts, a group might raid its neighbors’ livestock to survive if some calamity — drought or disease — had killed its own herd. But now, groups have begun raiding others’ herds to sell the animals for cash in a market.”\n\nThe conflict that struck Karmushu’s community began almost a decade ago. Samburu herders, urgently seeking fodder for their cattle, migrated south into other communities. The Il-Ngwesi were using “holistic land management,” including grazing, wildlife conservation and eco-tourism facilities, which contributed to a better state of grasslands, Karmushu said. Over years, violent raids on each other’s herds, camps and villages displaced thousands of people.\n\nBuilding Peace from the Grass Roots\n\nWhile Kenyan authorities and others had made many attempts to resolve the conflict, Karmushu’s peacebuilding group, IMPACT, was more locally rooted — indeed headquartered in Nanyuki, the seat of Laikipia County. IMPACT “knew the traditional methods that the Samburu and Il-Ngwesi use to manage land and also conflict,” Karmushu said, and began dialogues in both communities to shape a peace process consonant with those traditions. One challenge was simply the complex logistics, and costs, of transporting and housing delegations to the negotiating sessions. Another was that, even while elders from both sides were prepared to discuss a peace settlement, the fighting tended to be done by younger men, including hardliners who were prepared instead to violently disrupt that effort. Indeed, on the morning that elders gathered in 2018 to finally sign a peace accord, a dissident group of young Samburu warriors fired gunshots to disrupt the ceremony, forcing them to move it to a safer location.\n\nElders of the Maasai Il-Ngwesi community explain to visitors their peacebuilding process with the neighboring Samburu community to end years of violent conflict over grazing land and related problems.\n\nSoon after facilitating the peace accord, IMPACT joined four other grassroots groups working with herding communities to form a region-wide group, the Pastoralists Alliance for Resilience and Adaptation in Northern Rangelands (PARAN). which is gathering members — now 49 organizations, Karmushu said — across a growing swath of Kenya. A priority for this grassroots movement is to help the country’s dozens of herding communities secure the grazing rights they lost during the white colonizers’ scramble for lands. IMPACT has helped six communities win title to lands they now use. Another priority is to help communities adapt to the climatic degradation of lands and build more reliable livelihoods.\n\nSuch grassroots efforts in northern Kenya are often overshadowed by the region’s more widely known conservation trusts, many established on the vast grassland-and-forest ranches created by white colonists. The trusts often combine pastoralism, wildlife sanctuaries and safari-style tourism — an economic model that has yielded successes yet has not fully included the indigenous groups forced off the lands generations ago. Meeting the needs of such groups is partly what has fueled IMPACT, PARAN and their grassroots memberships.\n\nTraining and Research Are Vital\n\nTo strengthen grassroots peacebuilding, USIP provided grant funding to IMPACT for a project that has been researching how local peacebuilders achieve their best results. That project now is training and developing young environmental peacebuilders to apply the improved methods uncovered by the research. In late May, 16 men and women — who work in diverse communities in northern Kenya’s Laikipia, Samburu, Marsabit and Isiolo counties — gathered in a first of three workshops to share their experiences and best practices. Karmushu helped lead the workshop, part of an effort to expand the roles in peacebuilding of women and youth who are typically marginalized in traditional community dialogues, which are vital to peace processes.\n\nThe training was shaped by “participatory action research,” an approach to achieving social change that promotes research and analysis by local communities rather than outsiders — and then action by those communities on the basis of the research findings. IMPACT engaged 11 “environmental fellows” from pastoral communities who conducted nearly 150 interviews with witnesses to conflict incidents and other informants. This research pinpointed specific drivers of conflicts in northern Kenya. They have included:\n\nExclusionary wildlife management. Wildlife refuges that fence off large areas without full consultation with local communities can exclude those populations from their traditional lands and resources, causing conflict.\n\nWildlife refuges that fence off large areas without full consultation with local communities can exclude those populations from their traditional lands and resources, causing conflict. “Industrialized” cattle rustling.

Communal land registration. As authorities update and expand land ownership registrations, the process is surfacing old land disputes and is prompting wealthy elites to try to quickly acquire new lands, causing new conflicts.\n\nThe growing field of environmental peacebuilding “increasingly recognizes the importance of working inclusively — that is, engaging all the diverse members of a society, including marginalized ones, in helping define their communities’ futures,” said Tegan Blaine, who directs USIP’s work to reduce conflicts related to climate and environmental challenges. “It’s exciting to see groups using this approach in Northern Kenya. As climate change continues to impact these communities, this approach will be increasingly important for maintaining peaceful relationships.”\n\nLocally led, grassroots groups such as those now expanding in northern Kenya can more effectively adapt typical peacebuilding activities to local conditions. As environmental change intensifies and the competition for resources becomes even more heated, it is imperative that we support the next generation of inspiring changemakers who can build on the pastoralist communities shared interests and values to establish a lasting peace in the region.",

    "Experts: Challenges to Kenya Presidential Poll Results Have Improved Election Integrity": "For the third time in his career, Kenya’s main opposition leader Raila Odinga is challenging presidential election results at the country’s Supreme Court.\n\nSome critics are mocking the former prime minister for again refusing to accept defeat. But legal experts say Odinga’s petitions have improved the integrity of Kenya’s elections and the stability of its democracy.\n\nOn social media, the images of 77-year-old Odinga carrying stacks of his petition challenging the outcome of Kenya’s August 9 presidential election to the Supreme Court has gotten mixed reactions.\n\nPaul Mwangi, Odinga’s lawyer, has participated in all his presidential election petitions.\n\n“Those who keep criticizing the fact that Raila files petitions are the people who would want to commit wrongs and hope that there is no accountability for them. What they want to do is create an atmosphere of impunity where they are never held to account,\" Mwangi said.\n\nThe quest for electoral fairness in Kenya started three decades ago, following the country’s first multiparty presidential election in 1992.\n\nThe late Kenneth Matiba and Mwai Kibaki challenged the elections of President Daniel Moi in 1992 and 1997.\n\nHerman Manyaro, a professor of political science at the University of Nairobi, said the petitions have helped entrench democracy in Kenya.\n\n“Any of these things must be seen within the context of the struggle for democracy, human rights and the overall good of the country. The little gains we have made over the years have been from things of that nature. So, when Matiba goes to court, Kibaki goes to court, you are trying to enhance and extend the frontiers of democracy,\" Manyaro said.\n\nAfter upholding the election of Uhuru Kenyatta in 2013, the Kenyan Supreme Court made history in 2017 by being the first court in Africa to nullify the election of a sitting president, after Odinga filed a petition in that case.\n\nThe court cited election irregularities and ordered a new vote, which had been won by incumbent President Kenyatta.\n\nNow, after a narrow loss in this year’s election, Odinga is back at the Supreme Court for the third time in a row.\n\nMwangi, Odinga's lawyer, said, “The biggest thing we would want the court to do is go back to exactly what it did last time and tell them, 'We told you to change so that you can deliver a credible election; you did not change. Yet again, you have failed to deliver a credible election, so we are going to do the same thing we did last time, which is that we are going to annul that election.'”\n\nProfessor Manyora said challenging the system has long-term benefits.\n\n“If you go to court, whether you lose the case or not, at the end of it all, there’s something democracy would have gained. There’s something the country would have gained. And this is how we must see the struggle of one Raila Amolo Odinga,\" Manyora said.\n\nThe 2022 presidential petition at the Supreme Court marks yet another critical chapter in Kenya’s history of poll petitions. Analysts say regardless of the court’s decision, Kenyans are the winners in the long run.",

He outlined his efforts to work closely with the current leadership and stakeholders to help the country eliminate terrorists.\n\n“Those troops will be back home as soon as we've done with the assignment that we have in Somalia,\" said Ruto, who was previously Kenya's Deputy President for ten years, and who is not a stranger to the current situation in the country which neighbors Kenya.\n\nIn the last month, Ruto has met Somalia's new President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud with whom they have discussed mechanisms of making the war succeed. Ruto lauded efforts being made by Hassan Sheikh Mohamud to degrade the militants, having served previously as president from 2012-17.\n\n“I think with the election of President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, who I have met twice now, he has a much clearer view of where we need to go, I think he is more committed to fighting Al-Shabaab. His resolve is clear to many of us who are in that space,\" the Kenyan president added.\n\nThere are close to 3,500 KDF troops serving in the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia [ATMIS] and have been in the country for the last 10 years. KDF first entered Somalia in 2011 through the Linda Nchi operation under former President Mwai Kibaki before being absorbed into the peacekeeping mission in 2013.\n\nWhile serving in the country, the troops have been instrumental in liberating key towns among them Kismayo, which was once under the control of the militants. However, the troops have suffered a number of casualties including in El-Adde in 2016 where Al-Shabaab killed over 200 KDF soldiers.\n\nKenya has also been battling Al-Shabaab, especially in Garissa, Mandera, and Wajir counties with the militants often targeting non-locals. But with increased surveillance, the attacks have since been minimized, leading to relative stability in the country.\n\nAl-Shabaab threatens last month to carry out more attacks in Kenya and against KDF in Somalia if new president William Ruto keeps troops in the country.\n\nIn recent weeks, the peacekeeping troops have been working closely with Somali National Army, killing hundreds of Al-Shabaab terrorists in the Hiiraan, Galgaduud, and Bay regions.\n\nGAROWE ONLINE",

The report states that most measures are already being implemented in parts of Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\nLawrence Nzuve, Ngongang Wandji Danube Kirt, Maxwell Nyamu, Aminata Mbow Diokhane, Baba Drame and Issa Mboup at Diamniadio Stadium (© Athletics Kenya)\n\nIn 2022, for example, 19 African countries have established Ambient Air Quality Standards and another 17 have developed or are in the process of developing national action plans to reduce emission of short-lived climate pollutants. In addition, regional framework agreements for air pollution are in place for eastern, southern, west and central African regions. The Assessment concludes that it will take “integrated approaches” and proposes “the establishment of an Africa Clean Air Programme as a continent-wide platform for partnership to facilitate data collection and action at national, regional and continental levels.”\n\n“It is very important to develop this partnership between Athletics Kenya and Senegal Athletics because Senegal is preparing for a very important event – the Youth Olympics in 2026,” emphasised Cheikh Fofana, Deputy Director of Environment in the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development of the Government of Senegal.\n\nA press conference on the topic ‘Connecting sports to Climate and Air Quality in Africa’ was held alongside the AMCEN meeting. The objectives of the conference were to:\n\nPresent and share the status of air quality and climate change in Senegal and the implications for sports,\n\nHighlight the actions by sports organisations and federations to address air quality and climate action, including examples from Kenya and Senegal, and wider actions across Africa,\n\nGive a platform for leading athletes and sportspeople from Senegal and Kenya to share their experiences on implications of climate and air pollution on sports, and the role of athletes in raising awareness about these challenges.\n\n“We look forward to sharing the experiences and pathway on Sports for Climate Action with Athletics Senegal and for consideration by other sister federations in Africa through the Confederation of African Athletics,” said President Tuwei. “We hope the African Union will assist us in championing this important venture.”\n\nLooking to the future, he noted: “We will be seeking to work with the Confederation of African Athletics and our partners (UNEP and Stockholm Environment Institute) in enhancing and scaling up the training to other federations on Sports for Climate Action.”\n\nCAA for environment and climate action\n\nRepresenting the CAA, Director General Lamine Faty said: “Sport is one of the good ways to communicate environment protection and climate change. Air quality is important for athletes and more awareness activities will be organised with the expert knowledge of Athletics Kenya.”\n\nWith these key bodies united for climate action, the week’s activities were an important milestone for athletics and the environment in the African continent that will soon be hosting COP27.\n\nAlice Annibali for World Athletics\n\n\n\n"
