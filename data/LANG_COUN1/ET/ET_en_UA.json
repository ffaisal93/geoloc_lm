    "Responding to Ukraine’s Displacement Crisis: From Speed to Sustainability - Ukraine": "Some seven million people are displaced inside Ukraine, many of them with no home to return to. The grassroots effort organised to help them is not sustainable. Donors should keep channelling aid to civil society but lay the groundwork for the state to step in.\n\nWhat’s new? Tens of millions of Ukrainians have fled fighting since Russia invaded in February, in Europe’s largest movement of people since World War II. As the war rages on, local volunteer networks, aid organisations and the Ukrainian state are stretched thin trying to respond to the mounting humanitarian crisis.\n\nWhy does it matter? Though Ukraine’s recent military advances might enable some of the displaced to go home, millions have nowhere to return to. Helping them is a serious challenge for Ukraine and its backers – one growing more urgent as people struggle to overcome trauma, get jobs and find shelter ahead of winter.\n\nWhat should be done? Speeding up the delivery of financial support to ease the humanitarian toll is vital to Ukraine’s survival. A long view and a finely calibrated division of labour among the state, local civil society and international organisations will be critical for what will be a decades-long effort to assist the displaced.\n\nI. Overview\n\nRussia’s war in Ukraine has forcibly displaced people on a scale unprecedented in Europe since World War II. In addition to the millions of refugees who have left the country, some seven million people have fled combat zones for safer areas inside Ukraine. A sprawling grassroots network has organised to help them. Local governments and civil society groups, using donated money and goods, have worked to provide housing, food and medicine to those in need. The response’s ad hoc nature made it fast and flexible. But it is not sustainable. Nor is it easy to scale up for the long-term displacement crisis the country faces, for one thing because it poses challenges in ensuring accountability for flows of supplies. Donors and the international organisations they fund will need to make new arrangements that, while continuing to give civil society a prominent role, shift the burden onto the broader shoulders of the government.\n\nWith millions of Ukrainians living in cramped apartments, dormitories and gymnasiums, out of work and unable to return to homes destroyed or now in Russian-occupied territory, the scale of need is staggering. How displaced people will weather the winter to come, amid rising prices and fuel shortages, is already worrying humanitarian workers. International agencies face huge challenges in getting aid to those most in need at a time when the global humanitarian system is reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic and food and energy price volatility, not to mention several other major wars, and when the collapse of Russian-Western relations looks set to deepen dismal trends in multilateral crisis management, complicating diplomacy aimed at helping the displaced and those living near the front lines as well as in Russian-occupied areas.\n\nIn these circumstances, it is all the more important that the humanitarian response take a long-term approach, even while responding quickly to the emergency. Donors and international agencies should channel their assistance so that local civil society takes the lead now, but start laying the groundwork for government services to step in. Ukrainian authorities, civil society groups and foreign supporters should work together on more transparent rules for the incoming aid to clear up concerns about whether assistance is going to the people who need it most. A swifter, steadier flow of funds to the displaced would free recipients from dependence on charity and could eventually be a model for reconstruction when the war ends.\n\nII. Who is on the Move?\n\nOne third of Ukraine’s pre-invasion population of 41 million had to leave home during the first six months after Russia’s large-scale attack on 24 February. Some 7.3 million people fled the country, the biggest share of whom travelled through or stayed in Poland.1 Ukraine introduced martial law on the day of the invasion, prohibiting most men between the ages of eighteen and 60 from departing.2 As a consequence, more than 90 per cent of those who arrived in neighbouring countries were women and children.3 Among the internally displaced people (IDPs) as well, the majority, about two thirds, are women, as men face greater obstacles in travelling or seeking accommodation. Many men have also enlisted or stayed behind to guard property or hold on to jobs. More than half – 53 per cent – of IDP families have children, making child care and schooling a major concern.",

All times EDT.\n\n4:10 p.m.:\n\n\n\n3:25 p.m.: The number of people detained in Russia for protesting against the country's partial military mobilization has risen to nearly 2,500 people across the country, as prominent pro-Kremlin voices have begun questioning the way the draft is being conducted, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported.\n\n\n\nOVD-Info, a human rights group that monitors political arrests in Russia, said that 2,353 people had been detained as of Sunday, and at least 141 new detentions had been recorded on Monday.\n\n\n\nThe highest one-day number of detentions came on September 21, when protests were held in 43 cities immediately after the draft was announced.\n\n2:30 p.m.:\n\n\n\n2:05 p.m.: Denmark’s maritime authority said Monday that a gas leak had been observed in a pipeline leading from Russia to Europe underneath the Baltic Sea and that there is a danger to ship traffic,The Associated Press reported.\n\n\n\nThe operator of Nord Stream 2 confirmed that a leak in the pipeline had been detected southeast of the Danish island Bornholm in the Baltic Sea.\n\n\n\nThe pipeline runs 1,230 kilometers (764 miles) from Russia through the Baltic Sea to Germany. It is completed and filled with gas, but gas has never been imported through it, the German press agency dpa reported.\n\n\n\nThe cause of the detected leak wasn’t immediately clear.\n\n\n\nThe Danish energy agency said in a statement that the country’s maritime authority has issued a navigation warning and established a five-nautical mile prohibition zone around the pipeline “as it is dangerous for ship traffic.”\n\n1:55 p.m.:\n\n\n\n\n\n1:40 p.m.: Negotiators to a stop-gap spending bill in the U.S. Congress have agreed to include about $12 billion in new aid to Ukraine in response to a request from the Biden administration, a source familiar with the talks said on Monday, according to Reuters.\n\n\n\nThe source, who asked not to be identified, said the measure will also include resettlement funding for Afghan refugees.\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, U.S. President Joe Biden asked Congress to provide $11.7 billion in new emergency military and economic aid for Ukraine.\n\n\n\nCongress is facing a midnight Friday deadline to pass the spending bill that also would temporarily fund a wide range of U.S. government programs.\n\n1:20 p.m.:\n\n\n\n1:05 p.m.: The European Union and the U.S. on Monday questioned Serbia’s proclaimed commitment to join Europe’s 27-nation bloc after Belgrade signed an agreement with Moscow pledging long-term “consultations” on foreign policy matters amid Russia’s war in Ukraine, the Associated Press reports.\n\n\n\nSerbia’s officials signed the deal last week in New York with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, where most Western delegations shunned Russia’s top diplomat over the country’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\n\nSerbia’s foreign ministry has sought to downplay the importance of the signed agreement, saying it’s a “technical” one and relates to bilateral ties and not security issues.\n\n\n\nEuropean Commission spokesman Peter Stano warned on Monday that Serbia’s relations with Russia can’t be “business as usual” under the current circumstances when Moscow is violating the U.N. Charter with its armed forces committing atrocities in Ukraine.\n\n\n\n12:40 p.m.:\n\n\n\n12:15 p.m.: The United Kingdom has announced 92 new sanctions in response to Russia-backed authorities imposing \"sham referendums\" in four regions of Ukraine, saying the move \"is a clear violation of international law, including the UN charter,\" Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported.\n\n\n\nThe British Foreign Office said in a statement on Monday that the referendums, which began last week and run until Tuesday, are a \"desperate attempt to grab land and justify their illegal war.\"\n\n\n\nThe statement said that among those hit by the new sanctions are top Russian officials involved in enforcing the votes.\n\n\n\n\"Sham referendums held at the barrel of a gun cannot be free or fair and we will never recognize their results. They follow a clear pattern of violence, intimidation, torture, and forced deportations in the areas of Ukraine Russia has seized,\" Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said in the statement.\n\n\n\nThe sanctions also hit 55 board members from state-linked organizations that the United Kingdom said continue to \"bankroll the Russian war machine, serving as a stark reminder of the cost of supporting Putin’s operation.\"\n\n11:55 a.m.:\n\n11:40 a.m.: Ukrainians in the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol fear they will be called up by Moscow following a referendum on joining Russia in which some residents were forced to vote at gunpoint, its exiled mayor said on Monday, according to Reuters.\n\nMayor Ivan Fedorov said the last official route out of Melitopol to territory controlled by Ukraine had been closed, and that residents' concerns had risen since voting began in the four-day referendum on Friday.\n\n\"Our residents are frightened, they are panicking, they don't know what will happen tomorrow, and when people will start being called up (to Russia's army),\" he told a news briefing via video link.\n\nMelitopol, in southeastern Ukraine, was one of the first cities to fall after Russia's invasion in February. It is one of four regions to hold referendums that Kyiv says are a sham.\n\nFedorov said he believed the main reason for holding the referendums was to enable Moscow to conscript Ukrainians following Russian President Vladimir Putin's announcement of a partial mobilization last week.\n\n11:25 a.m.: Another Russian torture chamber has been discovered in Ukraine’s northeastern Kharkiv region, which until recently was occupied by Russian military forces, the Kyiv Independent reported Monday.\n\n“Ukraine's Security Service has found another Russian torture chamber in the liberated village of Lyptsi, where Russia's proxies and military kept pro-Ukrainian residents and brutally tortured them,” The media outlet said.\n\n“So far, the Ukrainian police's main investigation department has discovered 18 Russian torture chambers in Kharkiv Oblast,” it reported.\n\n11:10 a.m.:\n\n11 a.m.: European Union countries started discussing on Monday how to treat Russians trying to get into the bloc to avoid President Vladimir Putin's call-up for the war in Ukraine, Reuters reported.\n\n\n\nThe number of draft-age men heading abroad since Putin called up 300,000 reservists on Wednesday has posed a dilemma for EU members, particularly eastern states, that had been limiting Russians' access in response to the war.\n\n\n\nIt has also raised fears of increased traffic and possible security risks at frontiers.\n\n\n\nEU leaders gave mixed messages ahead of a meeting of their ambassadors in Brussels on Monday, with another one planned for Tuesday.\n\n\n\n10:45 a.m.: Local media are reporting that Belarus's authoritarian leader, Akexander Lukashenko, has flown to Russia to meet with President Vladimir Putin, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.\n\n\n\nNo details of the Monday meeting were given.\n\n\n\nBelarus has been a close ally of Russia during its war in Ukraine.\n\n\n\nLukashenko has allowed Putin to use Belarusian territory to stage attacks on Ukraine since the Kremlin launched its invasion on February 24.\n\n10:30 a.m.: The Kremlin said on Monday that no decisions had been taken on closing Russia's borders, amid an exodus of military-age men since President Vladimir Putin declared a partial mobilization last Wednesday, Reuters reported.\n\n\n\nAsked about the possibility of border closures in a call with reporters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: \"I don't know anything about this. At the moment, no decisions have been taken on this.\"\n\n\n\nPeskov also acknowledged that some call-ups had been issued in error, saying mistakes were being corrected by regional governors and the ministry of defense.\n\n\n\nPeskov said: \"There have been cases when the decree is violated ... These cases of non-compliance with the required criteria are being eliminated.\"\n\n\n\n10:15 a.m.:\n\n10:05 a.m.: A ship carrying thousands of tons of corn and vegetable oil from war-ravaged Ukraine docked in northern Lebanon on Monday, the first such vessel since Russia’s invasion of its neighbor started seven months ago, The Associated Press reported.\n\n\n\nAK Ambition, registered in Panama and loaded with 7,000 tons of corn and 20 tons of vegetable oil, arrived in the northern city of Tripoli, Lebanon’s second-largest, with Ukraine Embassy officials waiting at the port.\n\n\n\nLast month, Razoni, carrying grain from Ukraine, was turned back and eventually docked in Syria, Russia’s ally, after the Lebanese importer refused to accept the shipment, allegedly because of a delay.\n\n\n\nRazoni was the first ship to leave from Ukraine heading to Lebanon after a wartime deal signed between the United Nations and several countries for the save passage of movement of the ships carrying vital cargo.\n\n\n\nUkraine’s ambassador to Lebanon, Ihor Ostash, said AK Ambition’s arrival was part of a deal signed between Ukrainian and Lebanese companies to bring weekly shipments to Lebanon. It comes at a time when the small Mediterranean nation is in desperate need amid an unprecedented economic meltdown.\n\n\n\n9:50 a.m.: The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) said Monday that aid workers have reached over 13 million people affected by the war in Ukraine.\n\n\n\n9:20 a.m.: The head of the Russian Orthodox Church has said that Russian soldiers who die in the war against Ukraine will be cleansed of all their sins, Reuters reported. The statement came days after President Vladimir Putin ordered the country's first mobilization since World War Two.\n\n\n\nPatriarch Kirill is a key Putin ally and backer of the invasion. He has previously criticized those who oppose the war and called on Russians to rally round the Kremlin.\n\n\n\n\"Many are dying on the fields of internecine warfare,\" Kirill, 75, said in his first Sunday address since the mobilization order. \"The Church prays that this battle will end as soon as possible, so that as few brothers as possible will kill each other in this fratricidal war.\"\n\n\n\n\"But at the same time, the Church realizes that if somebody, driven by a sense of duty and the need to fulfil their oath ... goes to do what their duty calls of them, and if a person dies in the performance of this duty, then they have undoubtedly committed an act equivalent to sacrifice. They will have sacrificed themselves for others. And therefore, we believe that this sacrifice washes away all the sins that a person has committed.\"\n\n8:55 a.m.:\n\n\n\n8:40 a.m.: U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday announced an additional $457.5 million in aid to Ukraine for civilian security assistance.\n\n\n\nThe funds will be used “to enhance the efforts of Ukrainian law enforcement and criminal justice agencies to improve their operational capacity and save lives as they continue to help defend the Ukrainian people, their freedom, and their democracy from the Kremlin’s brutal war of aggression,” Blinken said in a statement.\n\n\n\nMore than $645 million has been committed by the U.S. since December 2021 for Ukrainian law enforcement and criminal justice, including for the National Police of Ukraine and the State Border Guard Service, Blinken said.\n\n\n\n“In addition to expanding our direct assistance to Ukrainian law enforcement, a portion of this new assistance will also continue U.S. support for the Ukrainian government’s efforts to document, investigate, and prosecute atrocities perpetrated by Russia’s forces,” he added.\n\n8:25 a.m.:\n\n\n\n8:10 a.m.: VOA’s Eastern Europe Chief Myroslava Gongadze interviewed Yuriy Kochevenko, of the 95th brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, who participated in the liberation of the town of Izuim from Russian military forces in the northeastern Kharkiv region. He talked about his reaction to Russian mobilization, western support, and what this war meant to him.\n\n\n\n\"We are fighting for our people, we are fighting for our families, we are fighting for our children, our future. Of the free world want to be safe the Russian empire must be destroyed,\" he told VOA.\n\n\n\n\"We defend not just Ukraine, we defend Europe, we defend the free world,\" he said.\n\n\n\n7:50 a.m.: Ukraine's president said that there was fierce fighting taking place on the front lines of its 7-month-old defense against Russia's invasion but that Kyiv was seeing \"positive results,\" Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported Monday.\n\n\n\nIn his nightly video address late Sunday, Zelenskyy claimed gains against Russian forces in the eastern Donetsk, northeastern Kharkiv, and the southern Mykolayiv and Zaporizhzhya regions.\n\n\n\n\"We have positive results in several directions.\" he said.\n\n\n\nRussia and its separatist allies in the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhya regions of Ukraine have been holding votes on possible independence and union with Russia that they call referendums but Kyiv and many in the international community have said are a sham.\n\n\n\nThe votes are scheduled to conclude on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nThey were announced amid Ukrainian counteroffensives in northeastern and eastern Ukraine that Kyiv has said have wrested back thousands of square kilometers this month.\n\n\n\n7:35 a.m.:\n\n7:20 a.m.: Russian men of fighting age should not be allowed to travel abroad, a senior lawmaker was quoted as saying on Monday, amid growing public concern that wider border closures will be announced to stop people fleeing the draft.\n\n\"Everyone who is of conscription age should be banned from traveling abroad in the current situation,\" Sergei Tsekov, a member of Russia's upper house of parliament, the Federation Council, Reuters reported citing RIA news agency.\n\nSince President Vladimir Putin announced a partial call-up of reservists to fight in Ukraine last week, flights to leave the country have sold out and protests have been staged — and swiftly broken up by police — in cities across Russia.\n\nThe announcement triggered panic that men of fighting age would be turned away at the borders, although the Kremlin has dismissed reports of people fleeing to airports.\n\nAnother lawmaker played down the idea of border closures and said the government was providing support measures to those being called up to serve.\n\n\"I would like to invite all colleagues (instead of inflaming the situation) to pay attention to the issues of social support for citizens who are subject to mobilization...,\" Andrei Klishas, another member of the Federation Council, wrote in response to Tsekov's proposal.\n\n7:05 a.m.: Pro-Western President Maia Sandu said on Monday Moldova may revoke the citizenship of its nationals who go to fight for Russia in Ukraine after being called up because they also hold Russian passports, Reuters reported.\n\nRussia launched a \"partial\" mobilization last week to reinforce its troops in Ukraine, and there are 200,000 people with dual Moldovan-Russian citizenship who live in the breakaway Moldovan region of Trandniestria.\n\nSandu said there was a risk that some of those people could be called up by Russia to fight.\n\n\"To prevent that happening, we are analyzing the possibility of applying the process of revoking Moldovan citizenship for those people (with Russian passports) who fight on the side of the aggressor,\" Sandu said.\n\n\"We are also looking at the possibility of making punishment harsher for Moldovan citizens (without Russian passports) ... who are in the ranks of the aggressor's armed forces,\" she said.\n\nShe said Moldova was holding consultations with Moscow to prevent cases of its citizens being called up.\n\nRussia has had peacekeeping troops stationed in Transdniestria since the early 1990s when an armed conflict saw pro-Russian separatists wrest most of the region from Moldovan control.\n\n6:30 a.m.: U.N. atomic watchdog chief Rafael Grossi said on Monday he is ready to hold talks in Ukraine and Russia this week on setting up a protection zone at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine that he often says is needed urgently.\n\n\"There is a plan on the table to do it. Last week I had an opportunity to start consultations with Ukraine and with the Russian Federation ... and I am ready to continue these consultations in both countries this week,\" Grossi told a meeting of International Atomic Energy Agency member states.\n\n5:30 a.m.: Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin said on Monday that he had founded the Wagner Group private military company in 2014, the first public confirmation of a link he has previously denied and sued journalists for reporting, Reuters reported.\n\nThe Wagner Group, staffed by veterans of the Russian armed forces, has fought in Libya, Syria, the Central African Republic and Mali, among other countries.\n\nThe press service of Prigozhin's Concord catering firm posted his comments on the social network VKontakte in response to a request for comment from a Russian news site on why he had stopped denying his links to Wagner.\n\n\"I cleaned the old weapons myself, sorted out the bulletproof vests myself and found specialists who could help me with this. From that moment, on May 1, 2014, a group of patriots was born, which later came to be called the Wagner Battalion,\" Prigozhin said.\n\n\"I am proud that I was able to defend their right to protect the interests of their country,\" he said in the statement.\n\nPrigozhin's Concord catering firm confirmed to Reuters that the statement was genuine.\n\nPrigozhin, known as \"Putin's chef\" due to his company's Kremlin catering contracts, has been sanctioned by the United States and European Union for his role in Wagner.\n\nThey also accuse him of funding a troll farm known as the Internet Research Agency that Washington says tried to influence U.S. elections.\n\nPrigozhin has previously sued outlets including investigative website Bellingcat, Russian news site Meduza and now-shuttered radio station Echo of Moscow for reporting his links to Wagner.\n\nWagner was founded in 2014 after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula and started providing support to pro-Russia separatists in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.\n\n5:15 a.m.: In Russia’s Siberia region Monday, a 25-year-old man shot a military commandant at an enlistment center, the local governor said.\n\nMany men opposed to Putin’s war or fearful of being killed in the battlefront have abruptly fled Russia on flights to other countries, while others have joined long queues of cars on land routes headed to the Russian borders with Finland, Georgia and other countries.\n\n5 a.m.: Almost 17,000 Russians crossed the border into Finland during the weekend, an 80% rise from a week earlier, Reuters reported Monday citing Finnish authorities, as the influx of people continued in the wake of Russia's announcement of military mobilization.\n\nThe border traffic had somewhat calmed early on Monday but remained busier than in the previous weeks, Captain Taneli Repo at Finland's southeastern border authority told Reuters.\n\n\"The queues continue to be a bit longer than they've usually been since the pandemic,\" he said.\n\nWednesday's announcement of Russia's first public mobilization since World War II, to shore up its faltering Ukraine war, has triggered a rush for the border, the arrest of protesters and unease in the wider population.\n\nYoung Russian men who spoke to Reuters after crossing into Finland via the Vaalimaa border station last week, some three hours by car from Russia's second-largest city St Petersburg, said they left out of fear of being drafted for the war.\n\nRussia calls its actions in Ukraine \"a special military operation.\"\n\nThe Finnish government, wary of becoming a major transit nation, on Friday said it will stop all Russians from entering on tourist visas within the coming days, although exceptions may still apply on humanitarian grounds.\n\n4 a.m.: Kremlin-orchestrated referendums conducted under gun barrels portend Russia’s imminent annexation of four occupied regions. Many residents fled the regions before the referendums got underway, scared about being forced to vote or potentially being conscripted into the Russian army, The Associated Press reported.\n\nThe referendums, denounced by Kyiv and its Western allies as rigged, are taking place in the Russian-controlled Luhansk and Kherson regions, and in occupied areas of the Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions. Russian authorities are expected to announce the regions as theirs once the preordained vote ends Tuesday.\n\n3:30 a.m.:\n\n3 a.m.: An EU official and an EU diplomat said ambassadors of European Union member states have been invited to a meeting of the bloc's crisis response working group on Monday to discuss concerns about an escalation of the war in Ukraine, Reuters reported.\n\nAmbassadors are not usually present at meetings of the integrated political crisis response group, which includes officials from the EU's executive and its diplomatic service.\n\nThe closed-door meeting in Brussels is due to start at 10 a.m. (0800 GMT), the sources said.\n\n2:30 a.m.: Kazakhstan, one of Russia's close ex-Soviet partners, will not recognize the possible annexation of Ukraine's eastern regions by Russia through referendums held there, Reuters reported Monday, citing the Central Asian nation's foreign ministry.\n\nVoting took place in four Ukrainian regions mostly held by Russian forces, the start of a plan by President Vladimir Putin to annex a big chunk of Ukraine in what the West says is violation of international law that significantly escalates war in the country. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine \"a special military operation.\"\n\n\"As for the holding of referendums ... Kazakhstan proceeds from the principles of territorial integrity of states, their sovereign equivalence and peaceful coexistence,\" ministry spokesman Aibek Smadiyarov said.\n\nKazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev has repeatedly called for the resolution of the Ukrainian conflict in line with the United Nations charter.\n\n\"We reconfirm our readiness to provide all possible assistance to the establishment of a political dialog,\" Smadiyarov said. \"At the same time, our country believes that maintaining stability at either regional or global level is the most important goal.\"\n\n2 a.m.: Britain said on Monday that initial tranches of men called up for Russia's partial mobilization have started arriving at military bases.\n\n\"Russia will now face an administrative and logistical challenge to provide training for the troops,\" the British Ministry of Defense said in an intelligence update.\n\nMany of the drafted troops will not have had any military experience for some years, the intelligence update added.\n\nEarlier last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that he had signed a decree on partial mobilization beginning Wednesday.\n\n1:30 a.m.: The South command of Ukraine's forces said Monday two drones launched by Russian forces into the Odesa region in Ukraine hit military objects causing a fire and the detonation of ammunition, Reuters reported.\n\n\"As a result of a large-scale fire and the detonation of ammunition, the evacuation of the civilian population was organized,\" the command said in statement on the Telegram.\n\n\"Preliminarily, there have been no casualties.\"\n\n1:15 a.m.: Denmark warns of danger of spills from tankers carrying Russian oil, the Financial Times reports.\n\n1 a.m.: Politicians in Bulgaria are crisscrossing the Balkan country of nearly 7 million to convince voters to cast ballots for them in snap parliamentary elections scheduled for October 2, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported.\n\nBut one candidate, Ivan Kalchev, is not on the campaign trail, but the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\nKalchev traveled to Ukraine in early March to join up with the foreign legion organized by Kyiv, shortly after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine on February 24.\n\n12:30 a.m.: According to independent Russian media outlet Meduza, Russia plans to ban men of conscription age from leaving country beginning Wednesday, The Kyiv Independent reported.\n\nMeduza said the ban will be announced at the end of referenda in the four occupied regions of Ukraine — Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. However, Ukraine, the U.S. and their Western allies are calling the referenda sham votes and of no legal consequence. Any Russian annexation of Ukrainian land would not be globally recognized.\n\nThe news outlet cited two sources in the Kremlin saying that the most likely date the borders will be shut is Wednesday.\n\nOn September 21, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said that the army planned to mobilize 300,000 conscripts for the war against Ukraine following Russian President Vladimir Putin's announcement of \"partial mobilization\" in Russia. Later, Meduza citing undisclosed sources, reported that Russia plans to mobilize 1.2 million conscripts for war against Ukraine, the Kyiv Independent reported.\n\nRussian proxies in the occupied parts of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts have announced that between Friday and Tuesday, they will rush \"referendums\" on these areas joining Russia.

    "Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 215 of the invasion": "A Russian man has shot the leader of the local military draft committee in a Siberian town after telling him he would refuse to fight in the war in Ukraine. The incident took place in the city of Ust-Ilimsk, a town of about 85,000 people in the Irkutsk region in Siberia. Video showed the gunman, dressed in camouflage, firing at the official from point blank range as other potential draftees for the Russian invasion fled the room. Reports say that at least three shots were fired.\n\nProtests against the Vladimir Putin’s partial military mobilisation order appeared to continue on Sunday in the Russian republic of Dagestan, with videos showing standoffs between police and the public. Video footage posted on social media showed police arresting demonstrators protesting against the order to draft 300,000 more Russians to the army for the war effort in Ukraine.\n\nLong queues of vehicles were at border crossing between Russia and Mongolia on Sunday as people continued to flee the Kremlin’s mobilisation order, AFP reported. The head of a checkpoint in the town of Altanbulag told the agency that more than 3,000 Russians had entered Mongolia via the crossing since Wednesday.\n\nSergei Tsekov, a member of Russia’s upper house of parliament, the Federation Council, has called for the Russian border to be shut “to ban anyone who is of military age from traveling abroad”.\n\nUkraine’s armed forces general staff has claimed some Russian conscripts from the Kremlin’s mass mobilisation are being sent directly to the frontlines in Ukraine without training. Amid warnings from the UK’s Ministry of Defence and other experts that many of those conscripted were likely to get little meaningful training – and faced the risk of “high rates of attrition” when deployed – men recently mobilised by pro-Russian occupation officials in Ukraine were also being readied for the frontline. Those included newly drafted personnel in Crimea as well as conscripts in the Luhansk region who have received draft summonses in recent days.\n\nThe Russian news agency RIA Novosti is carrying some turnout figures for the widely derided “referendums” in occupied Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson which began on Friday. The figures suggest that turnout has been sufficient for the proxy-Russian authorities to declare them legitimate, ranging from 77% in Donetsk to 49% in Kherson.\n\nPro-Russian authorities have claimed that in Rubizhne in occupied Luhansk, a polling station had to be moved to a reserve location after shelling from Ukrainian forces hit the school where it was due to be held.\n\nEnergoatom, the state-run nuclear enterprise in Ukraine which manages nuclear power stations including the occupied plant at Zaporizhzhia, has accused pro-Russian forces within Zaporizhzhia of staging the appearance that staff voted in the widely-condemned referendum being held in the region.\n\nOleksandr Stryuk, Ukraine’s mayor of Sievierodonetsk, has decried what he called the “lie and propaganda” of the “referendum from the Russian Federation”, accusing pro-Russian forces of bussing people in from Crimea to vote and to stage propaganda photographs.\n\nSerbia will not recognise Russian annexation “referendums” in occupied Ukrainian areas. The Serbian foreign minister, Nikola Selakovic, said the referendums “completely contradict our state and national interests, our policy of dealing with territorial integrity, sovereignty and the principle of inviolability of borders”.\n\nThe UN’s atomic energy watchdog said it is ready to hold talks in Russia and Ukraine on setting up a protection zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.

The Ukrainian president said the country’s armed forces would throw out Russia’s forces and retaliate against “every strike of the aggressor”. He vowed that Ukraine would regain control of the southern Kherson region and the eastern Donbas, saying: “Every murderer and torturer will be brought to justice.”\n\nUkraine’s president renewed calls for western allies to cut Russian banks from Swift, the global banking system that allows banks to send messages to each other. “If we cut Russian banks from Swift, we need to cut all Russian banks from Swift,” he said.\n\nZelenskiy has also claimed in a US television interview that Ukraine has discovered two more mass burial sites containing the bodies of hundreds of people in the north-eastern town of Izium.\n\nRussian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, has said explicitly for the first time today that he had founded the Wagner mercenary group and confirmed its deployment to countries in Latin America and Africa.\n\nMoldova’s president Maia Sandu has said that her country may revoke the citizenship of those who go to fight for Russia in Ukraine.\n\nBelarus leader, Alexander Lukashenko, met Putin on Monday in Sochi.\n\nHungary’s prime minister Viktor Orbán has suggested he will hold a “national consultation” on EU sanctions against Russia, saying “The sanctions were introduced in an undemocratic way, because it was the decision of the bureaucrats in Brussels, for which the European people are paying. We need to know the opinion of the people. For the first time in Europe, in Hungary, we will ask for the opinion about sanctions.”\n\nJapan will ban exports of chemical weapons-related goods to Russia, and is “deeply concerned” about the possible use of nuclear weapons, chief cabinet secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said on Monday.\n\nThe United States and its allies will act “decisively” if Russia uses a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine, the US national security adviser says, reaffirming the Biden White House’s previous response to mounting concerns that Vladimir Putin’s threats are in increased danger of being realised. Jake Sullivan told CBS on Sunday: “We have communicated directly, privately and at very high levels to the Kremlin that any use of nuclear weapons will be met with catastrophic consequences for Russia, that the US and our allies will respond decisively, and we have been clear and specific about what that will entail.”\n\nThe UK prime minister, Liz Truss, has said its allies France and the US should continue to support Ukraine in the face of the Russian president’s increased threats and his military call-up. Truss said Vladimir Putin was escalating the war because he was not winning and had made a mistake.\n\nThousands of Hassidic Jewish pilgrims flocked to central Ukraine to mark the Jewish new year on Sunday, ignoring international travel warnings as Russian forces attacked more targets from the air.

This included:\n\na total of 5,996 killed (2,334 men, 1,605 women, 157 girls, and 190 boys, as well as 35 children and 1,675 adults whose sex is yet unknown)\n\na total of 8,848 injured (1,850 men, 1,356 women, 191 girls, and 264 boys, as well as 221 children and 4,966 adults whose sex is yet unknown) In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 8,382 casualties (3,591 killed and 4,791 injured) On Government-controlled territory: 6,657 casualties (3,213 killed and 3,444 injured) On territory controlled by Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups: 1,725 casualties (378 killed and 1,347 injured) In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, Khmelnytskyi, Poltava, Rivne, Ternopil, Vinnytsia, Volyn, and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 6,462 casualties (2,405 killed and 4,057 injured)\n\n\n\nMost of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with wide area effects, including shelling from heavy artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, missiles and air strikes.\n\nOHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), Lysychansk, Popasna, and Sievierodonetsk (Luhansk region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties.\n\nCivilian casualties from 1 to 25 September 2022(individual cases verified by OHCHR)\n\nFrom 1 to 25 September 2022, OHCHR recorded 897 civilian casualties:\n\n216 killed (71 men, 50 women, 2 girls, 4 boys, as well as 1 child and 88 adults whose sex is yet unknown); and\n\n681 injured (151 men, 105 women, 10 girls, 24 boys, as well as 15 children and 376 adults whose sex is yet unknown).\n\nThis included:\n\n160 killed and 564 injured in 120 settlements in regions (parts of regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred (81 percent of the total); and\n\n56 killed and 117 injured in 8 settlements in parts of Luhansk and Donetsk regions controlled by Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups (19 percent of the total).\n\nPer type of weapon/incident:\n\nExplosive weapons with wide area effects: 210 killed and 637 injured (94 per cent);\n\nMines and explosive remnants of war: 6 killed and 44 injured (6 per cent).\n\nThe UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine\n\nSince 2014, OHCHR has been documenting civilian casualties in Ukraine. Reports are based on information that the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) collected through interviews with victims and their relatives; witnesses; analysis of corroborating material confidentially shared with HRMMU; official records; open-source documents, photo and video materials; forensic records and reports; criminal investigation materials; court documents; reports by international and national non-governmental organisations; public reports by law enforcement and military actors; data from medical facilities and local authorities.

    "US Warns Russia of 'Horrific' Consequences of Any Nuclear Attack in Ukraine": "U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States has made it clear publicly and privately to Russia to “stop the loose talk about nuclear weapons” in the Ukraine conflict following Russian President Vladimir Putin’s statement that he would use any means to defend Russia.\n\n“It’s very important that Moscow hear from us and know from us that the consequences would be horrific, and we’ve made that very clear,” Blinken told CBS News’s “60 Minutes” show in an interview broadcast late Sunday.\n\nBlinken said using nuclear weapons “would have catastrophic effects for, of course, the country using them, but for many others as well.”\n\nThe U.S. response came after Putin signaled the possibility of a nuclear attack last week as he called up 300,000 military reservists to help Russia fight in its seven-month invasion of Ukraine. The troop augmentation came after Russian battlefield setbacks, with Kyiv’s forces recapturing large swaths of territory in northeast Ukraine that Russia had seized in the early weeks of the war.\n\nBritain’s defense ministry said Monday that the first of the call-ups had started to arrive at military bases, but that Russia faces administrative and logistical challenges in training those troops.\n\n“Many of the drafted troops will not have had any military experience for some years,” the ministry said. “The lack of military trainers, and the haste with which Russia has started the mobilization, suggests that many of the drafted troops will deploy to the front line with minimal relevant preparation. They are likely to suffer a high attrition rate.”\n\nProtests against call-up\n\nWidespread protests against Putin’s troop call-up have erupted in Russia, with police arresting hundreds of demonstrators participating in street protests in Moscow and elsewhere.\n\nIn Russia’s Siberia region Monday, a 25-year-old man shot a military commandant at an enlistment center, the local governor said.\n\nMany men opposed to Putin’s war or fearful of being killed in the battlefront have abruptly fled Russia on flights to other countries, while others have joined long queues of cars on land routes headed to the Russian borders with Finland, Georgia and other countries.\n\nRussia is in the midst of staging five days of disputed referenda in four regions of Ukraine it either fully or partially controls, votes where it assumes the local residents will support Russian annexation, which would give Moscow a pretext to defend the newly claimed territory. In some instances, Russian soldiers have been going door to door to order Ukrainians to vote at gunpoint.\n\nBut Ukraine, the U.S. and other Western allies are calling the referenda sham votes and of no legal consequence. Any Russian annexation of Ukrainian land would not be globally recognized.\n\n“These so-called elections are a sham, period,” Blinken told CBS. “They go in, they put in puppet governments, local governments, and then they proceed with a vote, which they’ll manipulate in any event in order to try to declare the territory Russian territory. It is not. It will never be recognized as such. And the Ukrainians have every right to take it back.”\n\nFears are running high that Moscow may close the borders to men of fighting age after the referendums in Ukraine end to stem the mass exodus.\n\nNuclear saber-rattling\n\nA State Department official said Putin gave the U.S. and its allies a gift last week by engaging in nuclear saber-rattling, calling for a troop mobilization and announcing the referenda while the U.S. was at the United Nations “talking about sovereignty and international peace and security.” The official said Russia “couldn’t have timed it better to put a spotlight on the grave offenses that Russia is committing to Ukraine and the international order.”\n\nAt a commemoration of the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons in New York, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Monday that nuclear weapons do not offer security, just “carnage and chaos” and said eliminating them would be the greatest gift humanity could offer future generations.\n\n“Let me be clear: The era of nuclear blackmail must end,” Guterres said. “The idea that any country could fight and win a nuclear war is deranged. Any use of a nuclear weapon would incite a humanitarian Armageddon. We need to step back.”\n\nIn an interview aired Sunday on CBS News’s “Face the Nation” show, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Ukrainians who refuse to vote in the referenda face significant retribution from Russian forces.\n\n“Russians can turn off their electricity and won’t give them an opportunity to live a normal human life,” Zelenskyy said. “They force people, they throw them in prisons. They force them to come to these pseudo-referenda. And also, they also announced mobilization [of 300,000 reservists.] They’re forcing people to fight, people from the temporarily occupied territories.”\n\nBut Zelenskyy said, “There is no support in the society for this referendum.”\n\nThe Ukrainian leader said the referenda are “a very dangerous signal” from Putin that he does not intend to end the war.\n\n“He knows that he’s losing the war,” Zelenskyy said. “In the battlefield, Ukraine has seized the initiative. He cannot explain to his society why, and he is looking for answers to these questions.”\n\nWith the West and Ukraine saying the voting is almost assuredly preordained to favor Russian annexation, Zelenskyy said Moscow will then say, “Now, it’s the West who attacks Russia. Now, the West attacks our territories. We have to let the society join Russia, the society that wanted to be with Russia.”\n\nZelenskyy said a Russian nuclear attack on Ukraine “could be a reality. He wants to scare the whole world. These are the first steps of his nuclear blackmail. I don’t think he's bluffing.”\n\nBut Zelenskyy added, “I think the world is deterring it and containing this threat. We need to keep putting pressure on him and not allow him to continue.”\n\nHe concluded, “I think that the military strategy of military and political leadership of Russia has not changed: its occupation of our country. And of course, they want to destabilize our country from inside.”\n\nHe said Ukrainians are united against Putin, “even more united now than ever, over the 31 years of our independence from the Soviet Union.”\n\n“So, he does everything possible to destabilize our country to make sure we’re weaker. And for that he wants to divide us of course, I’m one of the targets, of course, it goes without saying,” Zelenskyy said. “It’s not because of my personality, just because... because the president is a leader of their country.”\n\nSome information for this story came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.",
    "Inside the Ukrainian Counterstrike That Turned the Tide of the War": "It would be easy to underestimate Valeriy Zaluzhny. When not in uniform, the general prefers T-shirts and shorts that match his easygoing sense of humor. When he first heard from aides to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in late July 2021 that he was being tapped to lead the country’s armed forces, his stunned response was, “What do you mean?” As it sank in that he would become commander in chief, he tells TIME in his first interview since the Russian invasion began, he felt as if he had been punched “not just below the belt but straight into a knockout.” George Patton or Douglas MacArthur he is not.\n\nYet when the history of the war in Ukraine is written, Zaluzhny is likely to occupy a prominent role. He was part of the Ukrainian brass who spent years transforming the country’s military from a clunky Soviet model into a modern fighting force. Hardened by years of battling Russia on the eastern front, he was among a new generation of Ukrainian leaders who learned to be flexible and delegate decisions to commanders on the ground. His dogged preparation in the run-up to the invasion and savvy battlefield tactics in the early phases of the war helped the nation fend off the Russian onslaught. “Zaluzhny has emerged as the military mind his country needed,” U.S. General Mark Milley wrote for TIME of his counterpart last May. “His leadership enabled the Ukrainian armed forces to adapt quickly with battlefield initiative against the Russians.”\n\nPhoto illustration by Neil Jamieson for TIME (Source Photo: Gleb Garanich—Reuters Pool Photo/AP)\n\nThat initiative has now taken a key turn in Ukraine’s favor. In Kyiv’s biggest gains since the war began in February, a lightning counteroffensive in the country’s northeast in early September stunned Russian troops, who fled in disarray and ceded vast swaths of occupied territory. Combined with a second operation in the south, Ukrainian forces say they wrested back more than 6,000 sq km from Russian control in less than two weeks, liberating dozens of towns and cities and cutting off enemy supply lines. The Ukrainian army’s deft game of misdirection, touting a counter-offensive in the south before attacking in the northeast, caught Russia off guard. And it validated the Ukrainians’ arguments that intelligence collaboration and billions of dollars in weapons and materiel supplied by Western allies would yield results on the battlefield.\n\nThe sudden victories came at a critical point in what had become a grinding war of attrition. As the economic pressures built across Europe and around the world, skeptics were beginning to doubt whether Ukraine could endure a protracted fight. The dramatic rout rattled Moscow, forcing Kremlin propagandists to admit the setback and upping the military and political pressures on Russian President Vladimir Putin. On Sept. 21 he responded by announcing the first mass conscription since World War II, a partial mobilization of up to 300,000 citizens.\n\nUkrainian and U.S. officials alike believe the war will be longer and bloodier than most imagine. Putin has shown he’s willing to sacrifice his troops and commit atrocities to exhaust his adversary. In a menacing speech, he warned that he was “not bluffing” when he threatened to use everything at his disposal to defend Russia—an allusion to nuclear weapons. The recent Ukrainian offensive may be a turning point, but it is not the decisive blow. “In hindsight, we’ll look at this like the Battle of Midway,” says Dan Rice, a U.S. Army combat veteran and leadership executive at West Point who serves as a special adviser to Zaluzhny, referring to the pivotal 1942 clash that preceded three more years of war.\n\nA woman rides a bicycle on a street in Izyum, Sept. 14. Juan Barreto—AFP/Getty Images\n\nZaluzhny is just one of many Ukrainians responsible for the grit and progress of the nation’s outmanned army. Other key officers include General Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander of Ukraine’s ground forces, who led the defense of Kyiv and, more recently, the counteroffensive in the east, and Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine’s military intelligence service. But after the President, Zaluzhny has become the face of the war effort. His persona is omnipresent on Ukrainian social media. One widely shared image shows the “Iron General” kneeling in front of the sobbing mother of one of his soldiers, head bowed in grief in front of a casket. In another he flashes a grin presiding over the wedding of one of his servicemen during a lull in the fighting. Fan channels on Telegram have hundreds of thousands of followers, with many changing their profiles to a photo of the general with his hands held in the shape of a heart. “When Zaluzhny walks into a dark room he does not turn on the light, he turns off the darkness,” one viral TikTok video jokes.\n\nIt’s hard to predict where the war is headed or the part Zaluzhny will play in the end. But perhaps for the first time, it now seems possible that the army he commands could achieve victory.\n\nZaluzhny was drinking a beer at his wife’s birthday party when he stepped outside to take a cell-phone call and learned about his new job. The 48-year-old general’s rank and stature at the time were far below the position Zelensky was offering him. Commander in chief of the armed forces of Ukraine is the nation’s top military title, outranked only by the President himself. The height of that perch induced a feeling like vertigo. “I’ve often looked back and asked myself: How did I get myself into this?” Zaluzhny told TIME in a June interview.\n\nTo some, the choice seemed rash. While he had earned a reputation as an aggressive and ambitious commander, Zaluzhny was also considered a bit of a goofball, better known for clowning around with his troops than disciplining them. Born on a Soviet military garrison in northern Ukraine in 1973, he says he had dreams of becoming a comedian, much like Zelensky himself. Instead, he followed in the footsteps of his military family, entering the academy in Odessa in the 1990s as the Soviet Union collapsed and Ukraine descended into crisis.\n\nCommander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valeriy Zaluzhny attends a meeting with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, as Russia's attack on Ukraine continues, in Kyiv on April 24, 2022. Ukrainian Presidential Press Service/Reuters\n\nZaluzhny rose through the ranks with a new generation of officers that bridged very different eras: raised in Soviet Ukraine, but eager to shed USSR military dogma. For a master’s thesis, Zaluzhny analyzed U.S. military structure. Seeing how Ukrainian forces were still weighed down by the Soviet model that relied on rigid, top-heavy decision-making, he began to implement changes to mirror the forces of U.S. and NATO partners.\n\nZaluzhny worked his way from commanding a platoon to leading the country’s forces on the eastern front following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. In that role, he developed junior officers and encouraged more agile decision-making, pushing down authority to commanders on the ground. Unlike in the Russian army, sergeants would not be “scapegoats,” but rather real deputies meant to create a pipeline of military talent, he said in a 2020 interview published by the Ukrainian Defense Ministry. “There is no going back,” he said, to “the army of 2013.”\n\nBut Zaluzhny also respected and admired the institutions of his Russian counterparts. In his office, he keeps the collected works of General Valery Gerasimov, the head of the Russian armed forces, who is 17 years his senior. “I was raised on Russian military doctrine, and I still think that the science of war is all located in Russia,” Zaluzhny says. “I learned from Gerasimov. I read everything he ever wrote … He is the smartest of men, and my expectations of him were enormous.”\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky attends a flag hoisting ceremony in Izyum after the Ukrainian forces took back control of the city from the Russians.

It fell to him to brief the new President on military operations and command structures. He knew Zelensky had never served in the military, and had no plans to school him in the tactical details of warfare. “He doesn’t need to understand military affairs any more than he needs to know about medicine or bridge building,” Zaluzhny says. To his surprise, Zelensky seemed to agree. “This has turned out to be one of [Zelensky’s] strongest features,” says Oleksiy Melnyk, a former Ukrainian Assistant Defense Minister. He has allowed his generals to run the show “without direct interference into military business.”\n\nIn 2020, Zaluzhny oversaw an ambitious set of military exercises, which included a test of the Javelin anti-tank missile. With the President watching from the observation deck, the demonstration failed, and pundits went on Ukrainian TV to debate the bad omen for the nation’s military. Zaluzhny was sure he would be known in the President’s office as “the loser with the faulty Javelins.”\n\nYet Zelensky has shown a determination to jettison an older generation of officials in search of new blood, and a habit of elevating leaders with whom he feels a rapport, regardless of rank. In July 2021, with the Russians hauling tanks to the border and the Americans warning that Ukraine could soon face a full-scale attack, the President decided to put Zaluzhny in charge. “I gave my opinion that he strikes me as a fairly professional, smart person,” says Andriy Yermak, Zelensky’s chief of staff. “But the President made the call.”\n\nUnlike Zelensky, who was skeptical of intelligence reports that a mass-scale Russian invasion was imminent, Zaluzhny was part of a corps of Ukrainian officers who viewed it as a matter of time. Within weeks of taking up his post, he began to implement key changes. Officers would be free to return fire “with any available weapons” if they came under attack, with no need for permission from senior commanders. “We needed to knock down their desire to attack,” Zaluzhny says. “We also needed to show our teeth.”\n\nLon Tweeten\n\nBy early February, the pressure of his new role was starting to show. The launch of an ambitious set of military exercises involving thousands of Ukrainian troops had been a disappointment, with basic maneuvers meant to simulate a Russian attack exposing cracks in Ukraine’s defenses. In Zaluzhny’s view, the drills were a centerpiece of Ukraine’s defensive strategy, its best chance of survival, and the commanders were not taking them seriously enough. “I spent an hour yelling,” he recalls. “I lost it.” The men seated around the table were mostly older and more experienced than Zaluzhny, who did not have a reputation for losing his cool. “I explained to them that if they can’t pull this off, the consequences will not only cost us our lives, but also our country.”\n\nAfter the outburst, the generals picked up their preparations. They relocated and camouflaged military hardware, moving troops and weapons out of their bases and sending them on tours around the country. This included aircraft, tanks, and armored vehicles, as well as the antiaircraft batteries Ukraine would soon need to maintain control of its skies. “There’s no mistaking the smell of war,” Zaluzhny says, “and it was already in the air.” But when it came to the details of his strategy, Zaluzhny held them close. “I was afraid that we would lose the element of surprise,” he says. “We needed the adversary to think that we are all deployed in our usual bases, smoking grass, watching TV, and posting on Facebook.”\n\nWhen the invasion started on the morning of Feb. 24, the general had two strategic goals for Ukraine’s defense. “We could not allow Kyiv to fall,” he said. “And, on all the other vectors, we had to spill their blood, even if in some places it would require losing territory.” The aim, in other words, was to allow the Russians to advance and then destroy their columns in the front and supply lines in the rear. By the sixth day of the invasion, he concluded it was working. The Russians had failed to take airports around Kyiv and had advanced deep enough to begin straining supply lines, leaving them exposed.\n\nMilley, Zaluzhny’s U.S. counterpart, was in some ways astounded when he saw the Ukrainians holding out. He asked Zaluzhny whether he planned to evacuate to safer ground. “I told him, ‘I don’t understand you,’” Zaluzhny says. “For me the war started in 2014 … I didn’t run away then, and I’m not going to run now.”\n\nHe too was surprised by Russia’s blunders. When the enemy faced heavy resistance or lost the ability to resupply, they did not retreat or shift to a different approach. “They just herded their soldiers into the slaughter,” Zaluzhny said. “They chose the scenario that suited me best of all.”\n\nEven as the U.S. and allies continued to flood the country with billions in military aid, the news was grim. Russia pounded the strategic port city of Mariupol, killing thousands of civilians. In May, hundreds of Ukrainian fighters who had defended the last stronghold in the city, the Azovstal steel plant, surrendered. (More than 150 were returned Sept. 21 in a prisoner swap, including five top Ukrainian commanders.) Mass graves were discovered in towns and villages occupied by Russian troops. Still, Ukrainian officials insisted they could win. “We will fight until the last drop of blood,” Zaluzhny told TIME.\n\nA few weeks later, Ukraine began to do something that struck military analysts as unusual. From the top of the government, Ukrainian officials, including Zelensky and Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov, began to publicly tout their preparations for a large-scale operation to retake territory in the south. In anticipation of an attack, Russia began to reposition troops, including some of its most elite units from other regions to reinforce its positions in the south. On Aug. 29, the Ukrainian military announced that the long-anticipated southern offensive had begun.\n\nA Ukrainian soldier assists a wounded comrade on Sept. 12 in the Kharkiv region. Kostiantyn Liberov—AP\n\nBut there were indications something else was afoot. “We have a war on, not only in the south,” Oleksiy Danilov, the head of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, told TIME on Sept. 1. “The front line is 2,500 km long.” Many experts doubted that Ukraine would be capable of mounting a counter-offensive on one front, let alone two.\n\nFive days later, Ukrainian troops launched a surprise strike in the country’s northeast. The Russians were caught off guard. Many fled in disarray, leaving behind weapons and equipment. Local reports painted a humiliating picture of retreat, describing soldiers stealing civilians’ clothes, bicycles, and cars to escape.\n\nIn six days, the Ukrainian military retook an estimated 3,000 sq km of Russian-held territory, including strategically important rail hubs used to resupply its forces. The strike stunned the Kremlin, U.S. officials, and even top Ukrainians. “I taught myself to moderate my expectations, so as not to be disappointed later,” Reznikov tells TIME. “Some breakthroughs occurred a little faster than planned.”\n\nIntelligence and advanced weaponry provided by the West also helped. “They gave us the location of the enemy, how many of them are at that location, and what they have stored there,” Reznikov says. “Then we would strike.” The High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) provided by the Pentagon allowed Ukraine to destroy warehouses of ammunition, fuel, and command posts. Lighter vehicles like U.S.-donated humvees, as well as trucks and tanks sent by the U.K., Australia, the Netherlands, Poland, and the Czech Republic, allowed them to outmaneuver the Russians. “Ukrainians have demonstrated much better distributed tactical-level operations,” says Jeffrey Edmonds, a former CIA analyst and Russia director on the National Security Council. “They’re much more disciplined.”\n\nAlso crucial, Ukrainian officials say, was the flexible command structure that allowed them to exploit the quick Russian collapse. “The Ukrainian army has the freedom to make decisions at every level,” Reznikov says, likening it to NATO standards. “They do it quickly, unlike the Russians.”\n\nA boy rides a bicycle near an armored tank with a Ukrainian flag in the town of Izyum on Sept. 19. Oleksii Chumachenko—SOPA Images/LightRocket/ Getty Images\n\nUkrainian officials are careful to spread the credit for the military successes so far. “It’s not a story of one star, but a constellation of our military elite,” Reznikov says, naming a long list of celebrated officers from the armed forces—the infantry, navy, air force, medical corps and others.\n\nThere are rumors of tensions between Zelensky and his top military commander, though the President and his aides have dismissed them. “The so-called conflict with Zaluzhny was invented by our opposition from start to finish,” says Oleksiy Arestovych, a Zelensky aide and veteran of Ukraine’s military intelligence service. “On the one hand, it’s obviously made up. On the other, it has a painful effect, because stirring up conflict between the military commander and the commander in chief is a catastrophe.”\n\nHardened by war, Ukrainian leaders know the recent successes have only bought time. “Russia has staked everything on this war,” says Danilov, the head of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council. “Putin cannot lose. The stakes are too high.”\n\nUkraine’s operations in the south have moved slowly. As winter approaches, Kyiv must take care not to overextend its forces. And there are forces at play outside Ukraine’s control. The looming energy crisis could sap Western military support, with Russia already cutting its gas supplies to Europe from 40% to 9%.\n\nFor his part, Zaluzhny is girding for a long and bloody slog. “Knowing what I know firsthand about the Russians, our victory will not be final,” he told TIME. “Our victory will be an opportunity to take a breath and prepare for the next war.” —With reporting by Leslie Dickstein and Simmone Shah\n\nWrite to Vera Bergengruen at vera.bergengruen@time.com.",
    "China, India call for negotiated way out of Ukraine war": "Chinese FM Wang Yi calls on Russia and Ukraine to ‘keep the crisis from spilling over’ and from affecting developing countries.\n\nChina and India have called for a negotiated end to the Ukraine war at the United Nations, stopping well short of robust support for traditional ally Russia.\n\nAfter a week of pressure at the UN General Assembly, Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov delivered a fiery rebuke at Western nations on Saturday for what he called a “grotesque” campaign against Russians.\n\nBut no major nation has rallied behind Russia, including China, which just days before the February invasion of Ukraine pledged an “unbreakable” bond with President Vladimir Putin.\n\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi called on Russia and Ukraine to “keep the crisis from spilling over” and from affecting developing countries.\n\n“China supports all efforts conducive to the peaceful resolution of the Ukraine crisis. The pressing priority is to facilitate talks for peace,” Wang said. “The fundamental solution is to address the legitimate security concerns of all parties and build a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture.”\n\nDuring his visit to the UN, Wang met Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba in their first talks since the war began.\n\nEarlier this month, Putin acknowledged Chinese “concerns” about Ukraine during a meeting with his counterpart Xi Jinping.\n\nIndia, unlike China, has a warm relationship with the United States but it has historic ties with Russia, its traditional defence supplier.\n\n“As the Ukraine conflict continues to rage, we are often asked whose side we are on,” said India’s Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.\n\n“Our answer, each time, is straight and honest – India is on the side of peace and will remain firmly there,” he said. “We are on the side that calls for dialogue and diplomacy as the only way out.”\n\nUS officials have been heartened by what they see as China’s lack of concrete backing for the war and say Beijing has declined requests to send military equipment, forcing Russia to rely on North Korea and Iran as its own supplies dwindle.\n\nChina’s reaction to Russia is being closely watched for clues on its approach to Taiwan, a self-governing democracy that Beijing claims as its territory.\n\nWang held firm that China would take “forceful steps” against any interference, insisting efforts to prevent “reunification” with Taiwan would be “crushed by the wheels of history”.\n\nRussia on offensive\n\nLavrov at a news conference declined to answer whether there has been any pressure from China. In his speech, he sought to cast blame squarely on the West.\n\n“The official Russophobia in the West is unprecedented. Now the scope is grotesque,” Lavrov told the UNGA. “They are not shying away from declaring the intent to inflict not only military defeat on our country but also to destroy and fracture Russia.”\n\nThe US, he said, since the end of the Cold War has acted as if it is “an envoy of God on Earth, with the sacred right to act with impunity wherever and whenever they want”.\n\nHe also blasted the European Union as an “authoritarian, harsh, dictatorial entity” and said the bloc’s leadership forced one member state’s leader – Cyprus President Nicos Anastasiades – to cancel a planned meeting with him.\n\nLavrov criticised the West for not engaging with Russia saying, “We have never stepped away from maintaining contact.”\n\nWestern powers are looking at further sanctions after Putin called up reservists and made a veiled threat to use nuclear weapons, and have promised not to recognise the results of referendums on Russian annexation being held in occupied territories.\n\nThey have welcomed Lavrov’s isolation, noting how he showed up at a Security Council session on Thursday only to deliver remarks and not to listen to others.\n\nRussia enjoyed one rare voice of support on Saturday at the UNGA. Mali’s interim Prime Minister Colonel Abdoulaye Maiga, appointed by coup leaders, hailed the “exemplary and fruitful cooperation” with Moscow.\n\nThe military government has welcomed Russia’s Wagner Group security firm, despite Western allegations of rights abuses, as France pulled out troops who had been struggling to contain a religious armed uprising.",

Many are showing up in Istanbul\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ozan Kose/AFP via Getty Images Ozan Kose/AFP via Getty Images\n\nISTANBUL, Turkey — Russian men continue to flee the country, by land or air, days after President Vladimir Putin's announcement to mobilize additional forces to bolster his flailing war in Ukraine.\n\nAt Istanbul's main airport, a constant stream of Russian men came through the arrivals terminal. Istanbul is a destination of choice because it is one of few places where Russians can travel to without visas, with a long history of Russian tourism.\n\nTurkey, a member of NATO, has sought to cast itself as a neutral power broker between Moscow and Kyiv, and refused to join Western countries in economic sanctions on Russia. Since the beginning of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, many anti-war Russians have settled here, along with refugees from Ukraine.\n\nFlights from Russia to Turkey are sold out for the next several weeks, despite skyrocketing prices. But that hasn't stopped people from finding ways to get out, not only from Russian cities like Moscow, Sochi, Makhachkala and Yekaterinburg but also through neighboring countries Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Belarus and Georgia.\n\nThose who spoke to NPR, at Istanbul Airport, didn't want to reveal their names out of fear of the Russian government. Just last week, Putin signed a law that sentenced those who refused to serve, or evaded service, to 10 years in prison. The men NPR spoke to described long lines at airports and border crossings because of the sheer number of crowds and because of interrogation by Russian authorities.\n\nOne 32-year-old man who flew from St. Petersburg, Russia, told NPR that his flight was \"completely full of men, from 20 and then till 50.\"\n\n\"And all men stopped and — we were interrogated by police,\" he said.\n\n\"There was questions about, for example, when did you buy this ticket? What's the purpose? And the second line, they asked, did you [serve] in the military? When? And did you receive the post that you need to go serve?\" alluding to the conscription notices being served.\n\nA hurried dash to the border, and packed light\n\nNearly all the men said they had packed very light, trying to convince Russian authorities that they were leaving for short trips, and not to evade fighting in the war.\n\nMost said they have no future plans, and limited money. Those with families said their priority was to get settled and then try to bring their families out of Russia as well.\n\nA 35-year-old man, who left his family behind in Irkutsk, near Lake Baikal in Siberia, drove first to the Mongolian border, where he waited six hours to cross. In Mongolia, he said, he ran into several of his friends who were also fleeing, before he caught a flight to Istanbul.\n\nSome men said they decided to leave the country as soon as they heard the conscription announcement last Wednesday. The man from Irkutsk said he waited a few days to see what would happen, but once his friends started getting rounded up at night, he made the decision to go.\n\n\"They aren't just taking the reservists, but also men who have no military history and even those with more than three children,\" he said.\n\nRussian authorities, including Putin, had assured the public that only those with prior military service, no illnesses and fewer than three children would be called upon to serve.\n\nSeveral men told NPR that those who speak up against the war and mobilization are being arrested, beaten in custody and then sent to be drafted in the war — which is why women have been overwhelmingly taking part in the recent public protests in Russia.\n\nIt's about to get worse\n\nNearly everyone who spoke to NPR said they believed the situation is going to get worse, that a full mobilization is imminent.\n\nRussia is now conducting what it claims are referendums — considered illegal under international law — in occupied Ukrainian territories on whether to formally join Russia. The 32-year-old man from St. Petersburg told NPR many in Russia see it as the first step for Putin to annex those areas as part of Russia.\n\n\"Then of course the Ukrainians will attack those areas because actually it's their territory. Then after that, I think [Putin will] decide 'OK, they attacked our territory,' and he'll make the full mobilization,\" he said.\n\nAnother man, in a hurry to leave the airport, only said, \"everything is worse than you know and Russian men are going anywhere they can now.\"\n\nOne 36-year-old man from Moscow told NPR that his reason to leave was not just because he didn't want to fight, but that it was his way of not supporting the military campaign.\n\n\"If you are against the war, the best thing to do is try to get out from there and don't support it as we can, not pay taxes or don't work in Russian companies, etc.,\" he said.\n\nJust a few said they were hopeful that there would be a peace agreement to end the war, and hoped to wait it out before eventually returning home.",

General Assembly last week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was clear about the endgame. He dismissed making concessions to the Kremlin, called for military aid to help “return the Ukrainian flag to the entire territory,” and urged the international community to punish Russia for its invasion of his country and the alleged atrocities its forces have carried out since.\n\n“Russia will be forced to end this war, the war it has started,” Zelensky said. “I rule out that the settlement can happen on a different basis.”\n\nThe Ukrainian president received a rare standing ovation after finishing his remarks, a sign of the global sympathy for his cause. No matter Kyiv’s frustration with the equivocation of countries in the “nonaligned” world, many of which have maintained friendly relations with Moscow as the war raged, Ukrainian officials had reason to feel heartened after diplomats aimed numerous stern rebukes of Russia at the United Nations. The disquiet with Moscow grew all the more pronounced after it took two escalatory steps last week — greenlighting illegal, sham “referendums” in Russian-controlled areas of Ukraine, while ordering a partial mobilization of some 300,000 more Russian troops.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven more “neutral” powers voiced their disapproval of a Russian war effort that is widely viewed as violating international law and the principles of the U.N. Charter. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi insisted “the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries should be respected.” His Indian counterpart, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, warned against “egregious attacks committed in broad daylight” going “unpunished.”\n\nBut even as Russia’s international standing takes further hits, Ukraine may have reason to worry about shifting winds in the West’s democracies. Analysts have long fretted over the West’s stamina in the defense of Ukraine, aware of mounting concerns over surging energy prices and old suspicions of the liberal establishment in Brussels and Washington. That resolve has largely endured as we enter the eighth month of the conflict. But polls show flagging interest among some voters for supporting Ukraine, not least as economic challenges build up closer to home.\n\nElectorally, Europe is seeing a mini-surge for traditionally Euroskeptic, Russia-friendly political factions. The far right has emerged as kingmakers in ongoing coalition talks in Sweden. And on Sunday, Italian voters elected what will likely be a coalition of right-wing parties led by the far-right Brothers of Italy and the charismatic politico Giorgia Meloni.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeloni herself has rhetorically backed Kyiv in recent months, but key allies have made no secret of their affinity for the Kremlin. Matteo Salvini, head of the nativist League, has questioned the efficacy of sanctions on Russia. Silvio Berlusconi, the former Italian prime minister, took to Italian TV this month to defend Putin, a longtime buddy on the world stage.\n\n“Putin was pushed by the Russian population, by his party and by his ministers to invent this special operation,” Berlusconi said. “The troops were supposed to enter, reach Kyiv within a week, replace Zelensky’s government with decent people and then leave. Instead they found resistance, which was then fed by arms of all kinds from the west.”\n\nCenter-left challenger Enrico Letta was scathing in response: “Those comments demonstrate that in part of our electoral system, on the right but not only, there are those who, in short, say: ‘Let’s stop this war, let’s give Putin what he wants.’ I find that unacceptable.”\n\nFavorable opinions of Russia and Putin have declined sharply among Europe’s populists following Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine, especially among right-wing populists in Italy. 1/4https://t.co/vxTnds4jan pic.twitter.com/m3urQSE8Ha — Pew Research Global (@pewglobal) September 23, 2022\n\nTo be sure, polling in Europe after the Feb. 24 invasion shows significant drops in approval for Russia and Putin among right-wing populist parties, especially in Italy. But, as a recent Pew survey noted, these right-wing parties still remain far more positive toward the Russian regime than the rest of the public in their societies. Such sentiments underlay a controversial planned “fact-finding” trip by politicians in Germany’s far-right AfD party to Russian-controlled areas in Ukraine, which was called off last week only after a massive backlash at the possibility of elected German officials directly boosting Putin’s propaganda machine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the war drags on, there are fears among both Ukrainians and Western strategists that public skepticism over the toll of sanctions on Russia — which has seen energy prices spike in Europe — and the significant financial outlay to support Kyiv may mount. Hungary’s illiberal Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has long bridled at E.U. pressure on Russia, announced Monday plans to launch a “national consultation” on the continent’s sanctions regime.\n\nThere’s also the risk of growing indifference. Pew recently found that fewer Americans are concerned about the prospect of Ukrainian defeat than they were in the spring and a significant majority believe now that current aid to Ukraine is sufficient.\n\nThat’s not surprising given the tens of billions dollars of support already disbursed by the Biden administration. Pew also found that U.S. Republicans are more likely to believe their government is giving too much to Ukraine than too little. Distaste for the costs of the war are influencing the upcoming midterm elections, while a segment of the Republican base — championed by former president Donald Trump and cultivated by notoriously Putin-friendly Fox News host Tucker Carlson — has long harbored sympathy for Putin’s Russia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I think we’re at the point where we’ve given enough money in Ukraine,” J.D. Vance, Ohio’s Republican nominee for Senate, said this month. “I really do.”\n\nExperts believe the latest round of congressionally sanctioned funding for Ukraine could be the last to pass smoothly through the American legislature. “It would be too simplistic to say it is one issue more than another at this point. But voters are speaking up to conservative members of Congress,” Mackenzie Eaglen, a defense expert at the right-of-center American Enterprise Institute, told Politico. “This is really driven from the grass roots to Washington and not the other way around.”\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, are finding themselves in unusually hawkish positions compared with their domestic rivals. “The Ukrainians are making serious progress and are likely to continue to make progress into next year,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told The Washington Post. “If Republicans win the House, and word starts to leak out that they’re done funding Ukraine, that has potentially catastrophic impacts on Ukrainian morale and their ability to carry the fight.”\n\nWar in Ukraine: What you need to know The latest: Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a “partial mobilization” of troops in an address to the nation on Sept. 21, framing the move as an attempt to defend Russian sovereignty against a West that seeks to use Ukraine as a tool to “divide and destroy Russia.” Follow our live updates here. The fight: A successful Ukrainian counteroffensive has forced a major Russian retreat in the northeastern Kharkiv region in recent days, as troops fled cities and villages they had occupied since the early days of the war and abandoned large amounts of military equipment. Annexation referendums: Staged referendums, which would be illegal under international law, are set to take place from Sept. 23 to 27 in the breakaway Luhansk and Donetsk regions of eastern Ukraine, according to Russian news agencies. Another staged referendum will be held by the Moscow-appointed administration in Kherson starting Friday.

    "Diplomacy Is Still (Just About) Possible in Ukraine": "To be sure, there have been many failed efforts at resolving the Ukrainian conflict diplomatically. These go back to the start of the conflict in early 2014 following the Euromaidan revolution in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, and Russia’s subsequent annexation of Crimea as well as sponsorship of a separatist uprising in the Donbas. Diplomatic negotiations were then launched almost immediately. These primarily came in two forms: the Trilateral Contact Group, which included Ukraine, Russia, and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe to address the tactical and security components of the conflict, and the so-called Normandy Four between Ukraine, Russia, France, and Germany to address broader strategic issues from a political level.\n\nAll of these developments point to a serious risk of escalation in the Ukrainian conflict, one that has already bled over into energy disruptions between Russia and Europe and has come worryingly close to threatening nuclear accidents . But further escalation isn’t inevitable. Indeed, they could provide the impetus for something that has eluded the Russia-Ukraine conflict going back all the way to 2014: an earnest and dedicated attempt by all parties involved to reach a diplomatic resolution to end the war in Ukraine—or at least mitigate against its most destructive outcomes.\n\nThe protracted war in Ukraine is entering a new and potentially much more dangerous phase. Following rapid advances by Ukrainian troops in a counteroffensive against Russian forces in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region as well as the West’s enduring political and security backing, the Kremlin is now climbing the escalation ladder. Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a Russian military mobilization on Sept. 21 while issuing yet another semi-veiled threat of the use of nuclear weapons, a return to one of Moscow’s themes following earlier defeats in the initial stages of the invasion. Referendums to join Russia in several Moscow-backed separatist territories , which have long been discussed and are currently being held, are yet another sign of the Kremlin’s attempts to ratchet up pressure on Ukraine.\n\nThe protracted war in Ukraine is entering a new and potentially much more dangerous phase.

These go back to the start of the conflict in early 2014 following the Euromaidan revolution in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, and Russia’s subsequent annexation of Crimea as well as sponsorship of a separatist uprising in the Donbas. Diplomatic negotiations were then launched almost immediately. These primarily came in two forms: the Trilateral Contact Group, which included Ukraine, Russia, and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe to address the tactical and security components of the conflict, and the so-called Normandy Four between Ukraine, Russia, France, and Germany to address broader strategic issues from a political level.\n\nThese mediation efforts produced a road map agreement to end the Ukrainian conflict, known as the Minsk agreement, which included a cease-fire and a pullback of forces from the line of contact, but no part of this agreement was ever successfully nor sustainably implemented. There were many issues that undermined its implementation, including Russia’s deliberately ambiguous status as both a mediator and belligerent as well as disagreements between Kyiv and Moscow over the sequencing of the security and political components of the protocol. At the core of the Minsk agreement’s failure was that its purpose was used by each of the main parties differently, with Ukraine viewing it as a way to reclaim territory seized by Russia, whereas Moscow viewed it as a way to undermine Kyiv’s Western integration efforts.\n\nThe Minsk agreements were rendered fully obsolete with Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. No longer was the status of the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics subject to negotiation; instead, Russia chose to recognize these territories as independent states prior to launching an all-out military assault on Ukraine. The Kremlin claimed this was necessary to protect these territories as well as to achieve broader “demilitarization and denazification” of Ukraine. This led to the current phase of the military conflict in Ukraine, one a phase that has been negotiated largely on the battlefield and now appears to be on the precipice of escalating further.\n\nDespite the failure of diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, this does not mean that international mediation in the Ukrainian conflict has been futile as a whole. There has been one such diplomatic effort in the current phase of the conflict that has been not only agreed on and implemented by all parties involved (including both Ukraine and Russia) but could also serve as a framework for preventing the war from worsening.\n\nThat effort is known as the Black Sea Grain Initiative, an international agreement involving Ukraine and Russia that was mediated by Turkey and the United Nations. It was signed on Jul 22 and came into force on Aug. 1. This agreement paved the way for a humanitarian maritime corridor for grain supplies through the Black Sea and has allowed both Ukraine and Russia to unlock food exports that were obstructed as a result of the war. As the agreement has been successfully implemented for more than a month more than two months, it has helped alleviate economic pressures in Ukraine and food shortages around the world, offering evidence that practical collaboration can still be achieved between Kyiv and Moscow even in the midst of war.\n\nA key player in negotiating the agreement was Turkey, which has emerged as the most active and effective mediator between Russia and Ukraine since the conflict began. Turkey’s unique position as the only NATO member to not pass sanctions against Russia and Ankara’s complex yet constructive relationship with both Moscow and Kyiv gave Ankara the political leverage to mediate between both sides. In addition, Turkey’s strategic location on the Black Sea and its points of entry from the Bosphorus to the Mediterranean Sea made it crucial from a logistical perspective, as any shipments transiting the Black Sea must pass through Turkish-held straits to reach global markets.\n\nThe U.N.’s role was important as it gave multilateral legitimacy to the agreement, particularly as the Russia-Ukraine conflict has created grain problems that are global in nature. Russia and Ukraine collectively account for around 18 percent of global grain exports, with these countries providing the majority of imported grains to many countries in Africa and the Middle East. However, Russia’s military blockade of Ukraine’s Black Sea ports and Western sanctions against Russia make it much more difficult for both countries to bring their grain supplies to market. Not only has the war impacted the price of grain and led to rampant food inflation, but it has also created grain shortages in some of the world’s most vulnerable areas.\n\nAs a result, both Ukraine and Russia had an incentive to reach an agreement on grain supplies even as the broader military conflict endures, paving the way for Turkey and the U.N. to mediate. Since the Black Sea Grain Initiative was launched, there have been nearly 200 grain ship voyages, delivering more than 4 million metric tons of grain products. Despite occurring during an active conflict, there were several factors that facilitated the grain agreement. It had clear incentives for both Russia and Ukraine to unlock their grain shipments, and it did not require either party to compromise on their broader strategic interests. It also addressed concerns from Turkey and the U.N. over tackling food shortages and inflation, and there was buy-in among all parties for international observation and coordination toward implementation. This allowed diplomacy to be pursued in earnest and for the negotiators to focus on the technical details of the legal and logistical parameters of a deal while overcoming any political obstacles.\n\nAll of these factors are important to keep in mind when considering what a diplomatic agreement to end—or at least mitigate against the escalation of—the conflict in Ukraine could look like at this stage of the war. Like the Black Sea Grain Initiative and unlike the Minsk agreement, it is important for any such agreement to have a common purpose and one that is mutually agreed on by all parties. Although there are certainly no shortages of differences among Moscow, Kyiv, and the West, there are common goals that all parties can still get around, even if those are just to prevent a dramatic escalation that would hurt all sides. Such escalation could take numerous forms, from a Russian nuclear weapons attack to a full-scale energy cutoff to the economic and political crises such acts could set off.\n\nThus, the Black Sea Grain Initiative, with its focus on multilateral cooperation and identifying and implementing common goals, could provide a useful conceptual framework for preventing the escalation of the Ukrainian conflict. Turkey has made it no secret that it wants to help mediate a broader cease-fire agreement between Ukraine and Russia, with Ankara hoping that the experience of the grain deal—as well as a more recent prisoner swap it mediated along with Saudi Arabia—can be leveraged toward this objective. Successful mediation that produces tangible results, even on relatively small issues, can build the groundwork for future de-escalation.\n\nOf course, the key issues of territorial control and security guarantees are far more challenging to mediate, and it remains possible that both Ukraine and Russia will eschew such mediation efforts as their forces attempt to gain the advantage on the battlefield. Nevertheless, the latest developments have placed the Ukrainian conflict at a crossroads of sorts, with a serious risk of escalation on the one hand and an opportunity for a diplomatic climbdown on the other.",
    "Sri Lankans describe abuse as Russian captives in Ukraine": "Group was captured at a checkpoint near Ukraine’s Kupiansk city and Russian troops shot one in the foot and beat them with rifle butts.\n\nA group of Sri Lankans held captive by Russian forces in an agricultural factory in eastern Ukraine has alleged torture for months before escaping on foot as the Russians withdrew from the Kharkiv region.\n\nRecounting their ordeal to reporters in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, one of the seven Sri Lankans said he was shot in the foot. Another had his toenail ripped off and was slammed in the head with the butt of a rifle.\n\nUkrainian officials described their treatment as torture.\n\n“Every day we were cleaning toilets and bathrooms,” Dilukshan Robertclive, one of the former captives, said. “Some days Russians came and beat our people, our Sri Lanka people.”\n\nFour of the seven were medical students in the city of Kupiansk and three were working there when Russian forces poured across the border in late February and occupied large swaths of eastern and southern Ukraine.\n\nThe group said they were captured at the first checkpoint out of Kupiansk and then taken to Vovchansk, near the border with Russia, where they were held in the factory with about 20 Ukrainians.\n\n“They took our passports, other documents, phones, clothes, and locked us up in a room,” said Sharujan Gianeswaran. “There were also Ukrainian people with us, and they were questioned and sent away in 10 days, 15 days or one month. With us, they never spoke, because they could not understand our language.”\n\nUkraine police said the factory housed a Russian “torture centre” – one of 18 in the Kharkiv region.\n\n“They were bound and blindfolded. After that they were captured and then taken to the city of Vovchansk,” said Serhiy Bolvinov, head of the investigative department of the National Police in Kharkiv.\n\nSix among the group said they were held in a large upstairs room. The seventh, the only woman, was kept in a dark cell by herself, her companions said. The woman wept silently and did not speak as the group told their story on Saturday.\n\nOne man said he was shot in the foot by his Russian captors. Another had a toenail ripped off after the soldiers repeatedly bashed it with the butt of a rifle. The men showed their injuries to journalists.\n\n“Most of the time we could not understand what they told us and we were beaten for that,” Gianeswaran said.\n\nIt dawned upon the Sri Lankans that battle lines were shifting only when Russian soldiers ordered them to help load trucks with food and weapons.\n\nAs the last trucks raced away, the group asked fruitlessly for their passports and documents back, knowing to move around without them would be impossible in a country filled with checkpoints.\n\n‘Exhausted and hungry’\n\nRussian troops captured several cities and towns in northeastern Ukraine’s Kharkiv region early in the war. Ukrainian troops retook the area during a swift counteroffensive earlier this month.\n\nWhen the Sri Lankans realised the Russians were gone on September 10, the group left the factory and started walking towards the city of Kharkiv, having no real idea how to get to the regional capital that remained in Ukrainian hands.\n\n“We walked on that road for two days and were exhausted and hungry. We had no food or money to buy food,” Gianeswaran said.\n\nThey slept on the side of the road and walked until they reached a river. But with so many bridges in the region destroyed by one side or the other in months of fighting, they could find no way to cross.\n\nFinally, someone noticed their plight, gave them shelter, and called for a ride from security forces.\n\nPolice said the group was picked up in the Chuhuiv area, 70km (40 miles) from where they started. They are in Kharkiv now with no idea of what the future holds. Robertclive said they are psychologically damaged by their months in captivity.\n\nBut the men smiled when asked how they felt when they realised the worst of their ordeal was at an end.\n\n“They [Ukrainians] have given us food and clothing,” Gianeswaran said. “We thought we were going to die but we are saved and are being well looked after.”",

    "Ukraine War Risks Repercussions for Transnistria": "Destabilization in Moldova incited by Russia could prompt Kyiv and its allies to deprive Moscow of all its levers of influence there once and for all by purging the self-proclaimed Transnistria republic of Russia’s military presence there.\n\nWhen Russia embarked on its war in Ukraine, one of its undeclared goals was shoring up its position in the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria, and indeed in Moldova as a whole. Instead, the unrecognized republic has become one of the most vulnerable places on the map of what the Kremlin sees as the “Russian world.” Now Moscow runs the risk of losing its outpost on the Dniester River altogether.\n\nNot so long ago, Transnistria was the archetypal frozen conflict playing into the hands of the Kremlin. The government of the breakaway region’s main city Tiraspol has long publicly stated that Transnistria is Russian and will one day be formally recognized as such.\n\nFor decades, a largely symbolic military presence of 1,500 Russian troops in Transnistria has strengthened Russia’s position there. Those troops comprise two components: a peacekeeping contingent that has been there for thirty years, during which the conflict has remained frozen (something Moscow has prided itself upon), and Russian troops left to guard a Soviet-era ammunitions depot in the Transnistrian village of Cobasna, not far from the Ukrainian border.\n\nFor many years, the Moldovan capital Chisinau has seen its government alternate between pro-Russian and pro-European forces. Moscow had hoped that one day, it could use Transnistria to get all of Moldova back on its side by overseeing the return of the breakaway republic to Chisinau’s control, on condition that it would have special status within the country. By reincorporating the pro-Russian region into Moldova, Moscow believed Transnistrian voters would tip the balance in its favor and ensure that the country was always led by a pro-Russian government instead of continuing to drift toward the West. This is why Moscow has never recognized Transnistria’s independence.\n\nBut now Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine appears to have dashed any chances of Chisinau ever turning again toward Russia. In June this year, Moldova was granted EU candidate status, alongside Ukraine. Any future Moldovan government will be pro-European.\n\nBack in the spring, when few could imagine that the Ukrainian armed forces would be able to stop the advance of Russian troops, never mind launch their own counterattack, it seemed that once Ukraine was defeated, Transnistria and Moldova would be next. Russian Major General Rustam Minnekaev even said publicly that Transnistria was one of the targets of Moscow’s “special military operation.”\n\nAt that time, it seemed entirely possible that Russia might take control of all of southern Ukraine, giving it a corridor right up to Moldova’s borders. Today, following Russia’s humiliating retreat from the Kharkiv region, there is no longer any talk of Russian troops taking Odesa and reaching the Moldovan border.\n\nInstead, the overall picture for Russia looks bleaker with every passing day. Even Russia’s most fervent patriots do not deny that their country has been routed on the Ukrainian front. Ahead of President Vladimir Putin’s announcement on September 21 of a partial mobilization, fresh blood to swell the ranks was being recruited in Russian prisons. Donetsk and Luhansk, whose salvation was one of the purported aims of the “operation,” are being shelled more heavily than before Russia’s invasion, and local officials are being blown up in their own offices.\n\nIn other areas where Russia also claims the role of a security guarantor, it’s not much better. Azerbaijan and Armenia have resumed their war: fighting that Moscow had supposedly stopped in 2020. More recently, another military conflict erupted between Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, despite them both belonging to the Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organization. These factors cannot fail to take their toll on Russia’s authority and influence over its neighbors.\n\nAmid Moscow’s numerous diplomatic and military failings, Transnistria is becoming a tempting—and relatively easy—target for neighboring Ukraine. Kyiv’s claims that its armed forces could easily take control of the self-proclaimed republic are more than just talk.\n\nRussian troops there serve side by side with local residents: Transnistrians who are Russian passport holders. For the latter, military service has more to do with earning a decent wage by local standards than it does with identity. This puts their willingness to fight in doubt, especially since it would be hard to send in reinforcements from Russia: given the Russian army’s failure to carve out a corridor through southern Ukraine, they could not make their way there overland, and flying them in would risk them being targeted by Ukraine’s air defenses.\n\nTaking Transnistria would be a clear win for Kyiv. For a start, it could restock its arsenal with weapons from Cobasna. In addition, it would be a resounding victory over Russia. Losing its outpost on the Dniester River would be far more shocking and painful for Moscow than its recent retreat from the Kharkiv region.\n\nFor now, Ukraine hasn’t taken any concrete steps toward Transnistria: the most it has done is privately ask Moldova to open a second front against Russia in the breakaway region, which Chisinau declined to do. But there are signs that Russia is planning to stage a coup in Chisinau, which could provoke Kyiv to take action.\n\nDespite being held under house arrest since May on treason and corruption charges, the Kremlin’s longtime partner in Moldova, former president Igor Dodon, regularly calls for mass protests that could bring about a snap presidential election, something the Communist Party led by former president Vladimir Voronin would also like to see.\n\nThe fugitive politician and businessman Ilan Shor has gone one step further. Having fled abroad to avoid a jail sentence for a fraud conviction, he has organized an ongoing anti-government rally that began on September 18 in the center of Chisinau. With claims that 50,000 people will turn out, complete with tents and a stage for speeches, the protests should have all the trappings of a revolution.\n\nThe factor Shor is relying on to bring people to the streets is the cost of Russian gas, which is currently an unprecedentedly high $1,800 per thousand cubic meters in Moldova, and has caused prices for pretty much everything in the impoverished country to rise.\n\nShor, Dodon, Voronin, and their supporters argue that the country is facing the prospect of a very uncomfortable winter, and all because Moldova’s pro-EU government led by President Maia Sandu has fallen out with its strategic partner Russia, and is neither willing nor able to reach an agreement with Moscow on an affordable gas price. If they were in charge, there would be no such problem, of course.\n\nRussia has done its best to support such claims. A delegation of Moldovan deputies from the Shor party (named after its leader) and the Communist Party visited Moscow on September 9 and met with Leonid Slutsky, head of the Duma’s foreign affairs committee. According to the Shor party’s press service, the topics of discussion included finding a solution to provide Moldova with gas at an affordable price.\n\nNo sooner had the Moldovans departed than Slutsky sent an official letter to Shor inviting them to return to discuss a roadmap for solving existing problems. The signal was clear: Russia is prepared to compromise, but the current Moldovan government is not, and should therefore be traded in for one that is. The revolutionary scenario instigated by Shor is designed to bring about that regime change, but whether or not that is possible remains to be seen.\n\nThe key question is how far Ukraine, Romania, and the West in general will be prepared to go to stop Chisinau falling back into Moscow’s sphere of influence, especially while Russia remains at war with Ukraine. The answer is impossible to predict, but the fighting in Ukraine has certainly expanded what is possible. It’s not such a huge leap from launching missile strikes against Russia’s Belgorod region to entering a pro-Russian enclave 1,000 kilometers from Russia.\n\nThere is every chance that destabilization in Moldova incited by Russia will prompt Kyiv and its allies to deprive Moscow of all its levers of influence there once and for all by purging the self-proclaimed Transnistria republic of Russia’s military presence there.\n\nBy:",
    "From the UN to The Late Show, Ukraine’s diplomats are winning": "Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba delivered one of the more memorable quotes of the war during his recent visit to New York. Commenting on Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov’s hasty departure from a United Nations Security Council session on Ukraine, Kuleba quipped, “I also noted today that Russian diplomats flee almost as aptly as Russian soldiers.”\n\nJust hours after Kuleba’s instantly viral one-liner hit social media, he was starring on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Ukraine’s top diplomat received a rousing reception on the flagship US talk show, including a standing ovation from the studio audience in honor of the Ukrainian people and the country’s armed forces. Speaking with dignity, candor, and a dash of humor, Kuleba concisely expressed Ukraine’s view of the Russian invasion in a nine-minute interview that was hailed as a masterclass in public diplomacy.\n\nThe Ukrainian Foreign Minister’s strong showing in New York was a good example of the innovative approaches that are enabling Ukraine to gain the upper hand over Russia on the diplomatic front. In many ways, this confrontation is a generational clash between two very different diplomatic schools. While Russia is still represented by a Soviet-era generation of diplomats epitomized by 72-year-old Cold War veteran Sergei Lavrov, Ukrainian diplomats who came of age in the post-Soviet era are embracing new methods and achieving considerable success.\n\nSubscribe to UkraineAlert As the world watches the Russian invasion of Ukraine unfold, UkraineAlert delivers the best Atlantic Council expert insight and analysis on Ukraine twice a week directly to your inbox. Name First Last\n\nEmail *\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n\nUkraine’s wartime diplomacy has already delivered numerous significant results. These include securing the largest military support for any ally since World War II, along with unprecedented sanctions against Russia and other measures to increase Moscow’s international isolation. With the war now in its eighth month, the broad alliance of international partnerships created and nurtured by Ukrainian diplomats shows no signs of weakening.\n\nWhat has Ukrainian diplomacy been doing differently in support of the country’s strategic interests? Based on personal interaction with and observation of Ukrainian diplomats at work, several aspects of Ukraine’s new diplomacy are noteworthy.\n\nOne key feature is empowerment. I first met Dmytro Kuleba when he was an advisor to the Ukrainian President a few years before his 2020 appointment as the country’s Foreign Minister. At the time, he gave the impression of a thoroughly modern person. It was also clear that Kuleba feels entirely at home as a manager of issues, relationships, and teams. In concert with Ukraine’s Defense Ministry, he appears to be providing explicit direction to Ukraine’s diplomats in the form of specific, country-based military support goals. This approach is combined with an expectation of proactivity on the part of individual ambassadors.\n\nThirty years after Ukraine’s independence, Kuleba is presiding over the final dismantling of the inherited Soviet diplomatic corps, which was notoriously clunky, bureaucratic, and sometimes truly under-skilled. Amid the pressure and pace of a full-blown war, a new organizational culture is emerging at the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs that includes self-belief, positivity, and an emphasis on initiative.\n\nSavvy communication is at the heart of Ukraine’s diplomatic progress. As part of their empowerment, Ukraine’s current generation of diplomats have strong license to communicate. Ministry officials in Kyiv and Ukrainian ambassadors around the world are now routinely using a wide array of contemporary channels including social media, traditional mass media, stakeholder relations, and cultural ties in order to build Ukraine’s image and articulate the country’s wartime needs. The innovative and often unorthodox use of social media by Ukrainian officials has won particular praise.\n\nUkraine’s clever communication is very sensitive to the cultural norms and expectations of individual audiences. Ukrainian Ambassador to Australia Vasyl Myroshnychenko noted recently that media skills are now central to successful diplomacy. “The impact of the full-scale Russian invasion on Ukraine’s diplomacy can be compared to the influence of COVID-19 on digital transformation,” he commented. “One of the key changes has been in the communications sphere. The ability of our ambassadors to provide compelling arguments for why a host nation should support Ukraine has played an important role in rallying military assistance. Being media savvy and fully proficient in the local language is no longer just an advantage. It is a must at times of war.”\n\nUkraine’s diplomatic engagement with partner governments and international audiences is particularly important in terms of the struggle against Russian disinformation. While Russian embassies often serve as hubs for anti-Ukrainian fakes and efforts to weaken Western unity, Ukraine’s diplomatic corps has framed its communication as accessible, reasonable, fact-based, and engagingly human. Today’s Ukrainian diplomats are not afraid to demonstrate a sense of humor or employ pop culture references in ways that would have shocked their stuffy Soviet predecessors.\n\nThis positive framing of Ukraine, Ukrainians, and their future is attractive and encourages international audiences to engage. Modern communications studies consistently show that how you communicate, especially in terms of tonality and timing, is as important as the actual message you are communicating. This is a lesson Ukrainian diplomats have clearly learned.\n\nUkraine’s wartime embrace of public diplomacy has been particularly striking. The country’s diplomats are now regularly in newspapers, on TV, at conferences, and in corporate boardrooms articulating their country’s needs and making the case for further support. This approach is designed to reach not only political partners, policy experts, and diplomatic representatives, but also the general public. Ukraine’s emphasis of public diplomacy reflects an awareness that public opinion in democracies is critical to maintaining policy support.\n\nThe success of Ukraine’s wartime diplomacy is rooted in the same progressive values that are helping the country to advance on the battlefield and as a young democracy. These values reflect a nation that feels increasingly at ease with itself and confident of its position as part of the wider democratic world. Ukrainian diplomats are winning because they have a winning story to tell and the skills to do so effectively. Their progress mirrors Ukraine’s historic coming of age over the past seven months and captures the spirit of a country that is finally finding its voice on the international stage.\n\nPete Shmigel is an Australian writer with a background in politics, mental health, and Ukrainian issues.\n\nFurther reading\n\nThe views expressed in UkraineAlert are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Atlantic Council, its staff, or its supporters.\n\nThe Eurasia Center’s mission is to enhance transatlantic cooperation in promoting stability, democratic values and prosperity in Eurasia, from Eastern Europe and Turkey in the West to the Caucasus, Russia and Central Asia in the East.

    "Ukraine receives advanced US air defense system": "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in an interview broadcast on Sunday (25 September) that Ukraine had received sophisticated air defence systems from the United States.\n\nIt was the first acknowledgment that Ukraine had received the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS), long sought by Kyiv and whose shipment was approved by Washington late last month.\n\n“We absolutely need the United States to show leadership and give Ukraine the air defence systems. I want to thank President (Joe) Biden for a positive decision that has been already made,” Zelenskyy said, according to an English-language transcript of the interview.\n\n“But believe me, it’s not even nearly enough to cover the civilian infrastructure, schools, hospitals, universities, homes of Ukrainians.”\n\nZelenskyy also thanked the United States for HIMARS and other multiple rocket-launching systems enabling Ukraine to advance against Russian occupying forces.\n\nUkraine has staged counter-offensives this month to free from occupation large swathes of territory in northeastern Kharkiv region. It has also made advances in the south.\n\nRussia describes its seven-month-old incursion into Ukraine as a “special military operation” and denies it targets civilian sites.\n\n‘Full protection’\n\nRussia’s top diplomat on Saturday said regions of Ukraine where widely-derided referendums are being held would be under Russia’s “full protection” if they are annexed by Moscow, amid fears Russia could further escalate the conflict and even use nuclear weapons.\n\nForeign Minister Sergei Lavrov, addressing the UN General Assembly and the world’s media in New York, attempted to justify Russia’s February invasion of its neighbor, repeating Moscow’s false claims that the elected government in Kyiv was illegitimately installed, filled with neo-Nazis and oppressed Russian speakers in the country’s east.\n\nAsked if Russia would have grounds for using nuclear weapons to defend annexed regions of Ukraine, Lavrov said Russian territory, including territory “further enshrined” in Russia’s constitution in the future, “is under the full protection of the state.”\n\n“All of the laws, doctrines, concepts and strategies of the Russian Federation apply to all of its territory,” he said, also referring specifically to Russia’s doctrine on the use of nuclear weapons.\n\nRussia’s doctrine allows the first use of nuclear weapons if the country’s survival is threatened, be it from a conventional attack.\n\nThe comments came after an explicit warning on Thursday by former President Dmitry Medvedev, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, that any weapons in Moscow’s arsenal, including strategic nuclear weapons, could be used to defend territories incorporated into Russia.\n\nUkraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Lavrov’s comments, and Putin’s earlier statement when he said he was not bluffing about using nuclear weapons, were “irresponsible” and “absolutely unacceptable.”\n\n“Ukraine won’t give in. We call on all nuclear powers to speak out now and make it clear to Russia that such rhetorics put the world at risk and will not be tolerated,” Kuleba wrote on Twitter.\n\n(With additional reporting by Georgi Gotev)",

    "Russia’s call-up splits EU; Ukraine says it shows weakness": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia’s rush to mobilize hundreds of thousands of recruits to staunch stinging losses in Ukraine is a tacit acknowledgement that its “army is not able to fight,” Ukraine’s president said Sunday, as splits sharpened in Europe over whether to welcome or turn away Russians fleeing the call-up.\n\nSpeaking to U.S. broadcaster CBS, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also said he’s bracing for more Russian strikes on Ukraine’s electrical infrastructure, as the Kremlin seeks to ramp up the pressure on Ukraine and its Western backers as the weather gets colder. Zelenskyy warned that this winter “will be very difficult.”\n\n“They will shoot missiles, and they will target our electric grid. This is a challenge, but we are not afraid of that.” he said on “Face the Nation.”\n\nHe portrayed the Russian mobilization — its first such call-up since World War II — as a signal of weakness, not strength, saying: “They admitted that their army is not able to fight with Ukraine anymore.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nZelenskyy also said Ukraine has received NASAMS air defense systems from the U.S. NASAMS uses surface-to-air missiles to track and shoot down incoming missiles or aircraft. Zelenskyy did not say how many Ukraine received.\n\nAlthough the European Union is now largely off limits to most Russians, with direct flights stopped and its land borders increasingly closed to them, an exodus of Russian men fleeing military service is creating divisions among European officials over whether they should be granted safe haven.\n\nThe partial mobilization is also triggering protests in Russia, with new anti-war demonstrations on Sunday.\n\nIn Dagestan, one of Russia’s poorer regions in the North Caucasus, police fired warning shots to try to disperse more than 100 people who blocked a highway while protesting Russian President Vladimir Putin’s military call-up, Russian media reported.\n\nDozens of women chanted “No to war!” in the Dagestani capital of Makhachkala on Sunday. Videos of the protests showed women in head scarves chasing police away from the rally and standing in front of police cars carrying detained protesters, demanding their release.\n\nWomen also protested in the Siberian city of Yakutsk, chanting “No to genocide!” and marching in a circle around police, who later dragged some away or forced them into police vans, according to videos shared by Russian media.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAt least 2,000 people have been arrested in recent days for similar demonstrations around Russia. Many of those taken away have immediately received a call-up summons.\n\nUnconfirmed Russian media reports that the Kremlin might soon close Russian borders to men of fighting age are fueling panic and prompting more to flee.\n\nZelenskyy in his nightly address on Sunday described Russia’s mobilization as “criminal” and reiterated his call for Russians to stand up to it.\n\n“Fight so that they don’t send your children to die, all of those who they can take in this criminal Russian mobilization,” Zelenskyy said, switching to Russian for a brief portion of his speech. “Because if you come to take the lives of our children, I will tell you as a father — we will not let you go alive.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGerman officials have voiced a desire to help Russian men deserting military service and have called for a European-wide solution. Germany has held out the possibility of granting asylum to deserters and those refusing the draft.\n\nIn France, senators are arguing that Europe has a duty to help and warned that not granting refuge to fleeing Russians could play into Putin’s hands, feeding his narrative of Western hostility to Russia.\n\n“Closing our frontiers would fit neither with our values nor our interests,” a group of more than 40 French senators said.\n\nYet other EU countries are adamant that asylum shouldn’t be offered to Russian men fleeing now — when the war has moved into its eighth month. They include Lithuania, which borders Kaliningrad, a Russian Baltic Sea exclave. Its foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, tweeted: “Russians should stay and fight. Against Putin.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHis counterpart in Latvia, also an EU member bordering Russia, said the exodus poses “considerable security risks” for the 27-nation bloc and that those fleeing now can’t be considered conscientious objectors since they did not act when Russia invaded Ukraine in February.\n\nMany “were fine with killing Ukrainians, they did not protest then,” the Latvian foreign minister, Edgars Rinkevics, tweeted. He added that they still have “plenty of countries outside EU to go.”\n\nFinland also said it intends to “significantly restrict” entry to Russians entering the EU through its border with Russia. A Finnish opposition leader, Petteri Orpo, said fleeing Russian military reservists were an “obvious” security risk and “we must put our national security first.”\n\nRussia is pressing on with its call-up of hundreds of thousands of men, seeking to reverse recent losses. Without control of the skies over Ukraine, Russia is also making increasing use of suicide drones from Iran, with more strikes reported Sunday in the Black Sea port city of Odesa.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor Ukrainian and Russian military planners, the clock is ticking, with the approach of winter expected to make fighting much more complicated. Already, rainy weather is bringing muddy conditions that are starting to limit the mobility of tanks and other heavy weapons, the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said Sunday.\n\nBut the think-tank said Ukrainian forces are still gaining ground in their counteroffensive, launched in late August, that has rolled back the Russian occupation across large areas of the northeast and which also prompted Putin’s new drive for reinforcements.\n\nThe Kremlin said its initial aim is to add about 300,000 troops to its invasion force, which is struggling with equipment losses, mounting casualties and weakening morale. The mobilization marks a sharp shift from Putin’s previous efforts to portray the war as a limited military operation that wouldn’t interfere with most Russians’ lives.\n\nThe mobilization is running hand-in-hand with Kremlin-orchestrated votes in four occupied regions of Ukraine that could pave the way for their imminent annexation by Russia.\n\nUkraine and its Western allies say the referendums in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions in the south and the eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions have no legal validity, not least because many tens of thousands of their people have fled. They also call them a “sham.” Some footage has shown armed Russian troops going door-to-door to pressure Ukrainians into voting.\n\nThe voting ends Tuesday and there’s little doubt it will be declared a success by the Russian occupiers. The main questions then will be how soon Putin’s regime will annex the four regions and how that will complicate the war.\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Jari Tanner in Helsinki and John Leicester in Le Pecq, France, contributed.\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",
    "Russia-Ukraine war: Russians flee to avoid draft as west says Putin faces ‘major challenges’ to recruit 300,000 – as it happened": "09.30 Russia facing 'major challenges' over 300,000 recruit target, says west Dan Sabbagh\n\nThis is from Dan Sabbagh, the Guardian’s defence and security editor:\n\nWestern officials believe that Russia “will face major challenges” to mobilise 300,000 more people to its armed forces and that the country’s military will struggle to train and equip any new recruits unless the Kremlin waits several months before deploying them on the front line in Ukraine.\n\nThe intelligence experts acknowledged that the true recruitment target could be higher, but although some reports have suggested the Kremlin’s real goal is to mobilise 1million, the officials reiterated in a briefing on Friday that it was their belief it will be very hard for Russia to reach 300,000, never mind any larger figure.\n\nWhen pressed, one official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that 300,000 was “an immense number of people to then try to get in any sense of semblance to be able to fight in Ukraine”. The official added: “The authorities will face major challenges even in mustering this number of personnel.”\n\nRussia has faced problems with training and equipment throughout the conflict so far, and the officials said that would almost certainly extend to newly pressed recruits. “We think that they will be very challenged in training, let alone equipping such a large force quickly,” the official said. Recruits will likely be issued “old stuff and unreliable equipment,” they said.\n\nWestern officials believe there was a clear regional bias in Russian recruitment, focusing on poor and minority areas in the country’s east - and avoiding the country’s middle class urban centres. “We are not as yet seeing at the moment, recruiting teams in St. Petersburg or Moscow,” an official said.\n\nWestern officials are not keen to engage particularly with recent nuclear threats issued by Vladimir Putin, but they did say they believed that it was not necessarily the case that any Ukrainian territory annexed in the coming days through so-called referendums and weeks would be deemed as covered by its nuclear umbrella.\n\n“Russian red lines are not necessarily where they say they are,” the official said, and that “there are parts of the territory that Russia now controls which are of greater strategic significance to Moscow than others”. Although the locations were not spelled out, the Kremlin has long placed a high value on Crimea as well as the parts of Donetsk and Luhansk provinces occupied since 2014.",

    "Ukraine has more pluses than minuses for climate": "TINOS, Greece, Sept 26 (Reuters Breakingviews) - There are lots of reasons to worry about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but its impact on the fight against climate change is not one of them. Indeed, one of the silver linings of the terrible war is that it should make it easier to combat rising temperatures by spurring the global economy to emit less carbon.\n\nRecent depressing headlines give a different impression. As gas prices have soared across the world, many countries have switched to using more coal, which emits twice as much carbon dioxide for each unit of energy as gas. Demand for the black rock, which had been falling, is set to return to its all-time high this year, led by China and India, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\nMeanwhile the developed world is desperately searching for alternative gas supplies. African countries are keen to exploit their reserves, while European countries are building liquefied natural gas terminals and exploring pipeline projects. This new “dash for gas” could lock in irreversible global warming or create a mass of stranded assets, according to Climate Action Tracker.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nZOMBIE DIPLOMACY\n\nAs if this is not enough, climate diplomacy has broken down. World leaders are preoccupied with the war, the energy crisis and high food prices. Few expect big achievements at COP27, the next United Nations climate conference, which will take place in Egypt in November.\n\nParticularly worrying is how Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has exacerbated tension between China, Moscow’s most important friend, and the United States, Kyiv’s top weapons supplier. After Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, visited Taiwan last month, the People’s Republic froze climate discussions with America.\n\nCollaboration between the world’s two largest emitters of carbon dioxide paved the way for the vital Paris Agreement in 2015. Dialogue between Xie Zhenhua and John Kerry, the two countries’ top climate diplomats, created momentum around last year’s COP26 talks. But relations have now reached “zombie status”, according to Isabel Hilton, the founder of China Dialogue.\n\nWhat’s more, the invasion of Ukraine means both rich and poor countries are paying more for energy, food and in some cases arms, leaving less money for climate projects. Debt levels have risen almost everywhere. So has inflation, which central banks are attempting to bring down by hiking interest rates – in turn adding to debt burdens.\n\nReuters Graphics\n\nSECURITY AND CLIMATE ALIGNED\n\nThe good news more than drowns out the doom and gloom, though. Governments and their populations may now care more about securing energy supplies and making ends meet than saving the planet. But what they want for geopolitical and economic reasons will help in the fight against climate change.\n\nThink of a Venn diagram with three circles – one for security, another for prosperity and the third for climate. The war in Ukraine has created a bigger overlap between them.\n\nLook first at security. Many governments want to build up secure sources of energy, in part by increasing domestic supplies. In many cases, the only options are zero-carbon technologies, led by renewable energy sources like solar and wind power.\n\nEurope has lost its top energy supplier, Russia, more or less overnight. China and India, which produce little domestic fossil fuel apart from coal, have also seen the dangers of being overdependent on other countries. Even as they buy Russian oil at discounted prices, the two countries are ramping up production of renewable energy.\n\nMeanwhile, the tension between America and China helped shape Joe Biden’s so-called Inflation Reduction Act, which will provide $369 billion for clean energy. Part of bill’s motivation is to build a domestic clean tech manufacturing sector to avoid America depending on Chinese kit for batteries, solar panels and wind farms.\n\nPOWERFUL ECONOMICS\n\nEconomic forces unleashed by the war are also driving changes that are good for the planet. Gas prices are five times higher than they were a year ago, and markets are betting they will stay high for many years.\n\nReuters Graphics\n\nThis would normally spur more investment in gas projects and the infrastructure to get it to customers. But these are incredibly capital-intensive investments which, with the exception of shale gas, take a long time to develop and then an even longer time to pay back their upfront costs. Many investors are sceptical about the long-term demand for gas. As a result, new investment is being constrained, according to Michele Della Vigna, author of Goldman Sachs’ Carbonomics research.\n\nMany gas infrastructure projects will stay on the drawing board, except for those configured to switch to green hydrogen – made with renewable energy – when it becomes economically feasible. Moreover, much of Russia’s gas may stay permanently in the ground, as it will be expensive to build new pipelines to China, and Beijing won’t want to be too dependent on Moscow’s gas.\n\nConsumers, meanwhile, aren’t just switching to renewable energy because it is cheaper. The Ukraine war has also made people around the world more aware of the damage caused by volatile fossil fuel prices, says Adair Turner, chair of the Energy Transitions Commission. Renewable power is set to break another global record this year, according to the IEA. The agency now expects global gas demand between 2021 and 2025 to rise by less than half the amount it previously forecast.\n\nGOOD AND BAD TIPPING POINTS\n\nThe accelerated rollout of clean technologies is creating economies of scale, pushing down costs more rapidly than previously expected. This will make solar and wind power even more economically viable, once supply chains are expanded. It will also accelerate the point when infant technologies become financially attractive and take off rapidly, says Nigel Topping, the High Level Climate Action Champion at COP26. There is particular excitement about green hydrogen which can store electricity, be used to make steel, and power ships.\n\nNone of this is a reason to relax about climate change. Governments can do more to mitigate the damage the war is doing to the climate. It is in western countries’ long-term interests to help poor countries accelerate their green transitions. It is also in China’s and America’s interests to revive their climate diplomacy.\n\nMeanwhile, the world is way off the Paris Agreement’s commitment to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The world is heading to at least 2.4 degrees of warming, if not more, according to Climate Action Tracker.\n\nWhat’s more, the planet may be closer to tipping into catastrophic climate change than expected. This year’s massive floods in Pakistan and heatwaves throughout Europe suggest the effects of global warming have already arrived. The invasion of Ukraine may have spurred the world to emit less carbon. But it may also have less time to act.\n\nFollow @Hugodixon on Twitter\n\n(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

    "Leading economies sliding into recession as Ukraine war cuts growth, OECD finds": "The world’s leading economies are sliding into recession as the global energy and inflation crises sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine cut growth by more than previously forecast, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\n\nA dependency on expensive gas for heavy industry and home heating will plunge Germany, Italy and the UK into a long period of recession after global growth was projected by the OECD to slow to 2.2% in 2023 from a forecast in June of 2.8%.\n\nWith the global economy needing to grow by about 4% to keep pace with rising populations, the OECD said incomes per head would be lower in many countries.\n\nOECD’s interim chief economist, Álvaro Pereira, said the world was paying a steep price for the Ukraine war and Russia’s decision to restrict access to gas supplies more tightly than was forecast in June.\n\nHe said governments would need to encourage households and businesses to reduce their consumption of gas and oil to help weather a difficult winter.\n\nPereira also supported the determination of central banks to reduce inflation by raising interest rates. “We need to reduce demand, there is no doubt about that. And monetary and fiscal authorities need to work hand in hand to achieve it,” he said.\n\nChina’s growth rate is expected to drop this year to 3.2% – its lowest since the 1970s – causing a large decrease in trade with neighbours South Korea, Vietnam and Japan, dragging down their capacity to grow.\n\nA recovery in China next year to 4.7% will be weaker than expected, the OECD said, as Beijing wrestles with a property market and banking sector weighed down by huge debts.\n\nHowever, the Paris-based policy forum was most alarmed by the outlook across Europe, which is most directly exposed to the fallout from Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\nThe OECD forecast that UK GDP growth would be flat in 2023. However, this projection does not take into account the measures announced in the chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng’s mini-budget on Friday.\n\nThe OECD forecast a drop in growth in the eurozone from 3.1% this year to only 0.3% in 2023, meaning that many countries in the 19-member currency bloc will spend at least part of the year in recession. A recession is defined as two straight quarters of contraction.\n\nFrance could escape a recession if it grows by 0.8% next year as predicted by the OECD, but will suffer along with other European countries after the downgrade in GDP growth since June of 1.3 percentage points.\n\nRussia will shrink by at least 5.5% this year and 4.5% in 2023.

    "War crimes have been committed in Ukraine conflict, top UN human rights inquiry reveals": "The finding came in the first report by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, which was set up in March this year, at the request of Human Rights Council Member States.\n\n#HRC51 | \"War crimes have been committed in #Ukraine,\" the Independent International Commission of Inquiry told the @UN Human Rights Council.\n\n\n\nFull STATEMENT ➡️ https://t.co/A2hMpLf7kT pic.twitter.com/gmwRe315X9 — UN Human Rights Council 📍 #HRC51 (@UN_HRC) September 23, 2022\n\nMuch of the Commission’s work focused on investigations in the regions of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, and Sumy, where allegations of the most serious rights violations were made against Russian, or Russian-backed forces, early in the war.\n\nThorough investigation\n\nCommission chairperson Erik Møse said that investigators visited 27 towns and settlements and interviewed more than 150 victims and witnesses. They also inspected “sites of destruction, graves, places of detention and torture”, as well as remnants of weapons.\n\n“Based on the evidence gathered so far during the Commission’s existence, we found out after having carried out the investigations in these four areas just mentioned, we found that war crimes have been committed in Ukraine,” he told journalists in Geneva.\n\nThat conclusion is in line with findings published earlier this year by the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU).\n\nIt documented unlawful killings - including summary executions of civilians - in more than 30 settlements in Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy regions, by Russian armed forces while they controlled these areas in late February and March.\n\nBrutal executions\n\nOther key findings from the report include the surprisingly “large number of executions” in 16 towns and settlements, where “common elements” of the crimes included “visible signs of executions on bodies, such as hands tied behind backs, gunshot wounds to the head, and slit throats”.\n\nThe report, delivered to the Human Rights Council earlier on Friday, also documented how explosive weapons had been used by the Russian Federation forces, “without distinguishing between civilians and combatants in populated areas”.\n\n“We were struck by a large number of executions and other violations by Russian forces, and the Commission received consistent accounts of torture and ill-treatment.”\n\nSexual violence, including against children\n\nHorrific allegations of sexual violence against Ukrainian communities - including children - were also found to be based in fact.\n\n“The Commission investigated cases of sexual gender-based violence. It documented cases in which some Russian Federation soldiers made such crime,” said Commissioner Jasminka Džumhur.\n\nUkrainian forces were also responsible for human rights violations, said Commissioner Pablo de Greiff: “We have found two instances of ill-treatment of Russian Federation soldiers by Ukrainian soldiers, and we mentioned this in our statement. We have found obviously significantly larger numbers of instances that amount to war crimes on the part of the Russian Federation.”",

    "What meaningful action could the United Nations take to help Ukraine?": "What meaningful action could the United Nations take to help Ukraine?\n\nAs the U.N. General Assembly comes to a close, NPR's Leila Fadel asks Yale law professor Oona Hathaway how nations can unite in responding to Russia for its war against Ukraine.\n\nLEILA FADEL, HOST:\n\nAs Russians of fighting age flee to avoid conscription, much of the world is still trying to put enough pressure on Russia to stop the war. Here's Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on CBS \"Face The Nation,\" speaking through a translator.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"FACE THE NATION\")\n\nPRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY: (Through interpreter) They do not want any dialogue. We see referenda or we see mobilization that's emphasizing their will.\n\nFADEL: The United Nations General Assembly meeting could have been a place to make progress, but there's been no significant movement. So what can the U.N. do at this point? To explore that question, we're joined by Oona Hathaway. She's a law professor at Yale who used to work with the Department of Defense. Oona Hathaway is on the line from Paris. Good morning. Thanks for being on the program.\n\nOONA HATHAWAY: Good morning. Thank you for having me.\n\nFADEL: So let's start with that question. What meaningful action could the United Nations take to put pressure on Russia or to stop Russia's war on Ukraine?\n\nHATHAWAY: Well, the United Nations took a first important step back in March, shortly after the invasion, when it voted to deplore Russian aggression and voted - 141 members of the United Nations - against the invasion and only five members voting with Russia to oppose the General Assembly resolution. The International Court of Justice, which is a body of the United Nations, has also ordered Russia to suspend its military operations. And there have been a number of other important symbolic moves, suspending Russia, for instance, from the Human Rights Council.\n\nBut it is important to note that because Russia is a member of the Security Council - it's one of the permanent five members of the Security Council - that limits what the United Nations can do in terms of enforcement action. So it can't, for instance, order a military invasion. And there are a number of other enforcement measures that, ordinarily, the U.N. would have at its disposal that it can't with regard to a Security Council member.\n\nFADEL: So it sounds like a lot of the moves are symbolic. So really, what type of pressure can actually come to play, and what type of accountability could come to play for Russia?\n\nHATHAWAY: Well, symbolism matters. And it's important to remember that these denunciations of the war and declarations of the war as acts of aggression help set the stage for really important enforcement actions that followed by individual states. So it helped legitimate the unprecedented global sanctions against Russia and the really, truly unprecedented marshalling of resources to support Ukraine in opposing the war of aggression by Russia. So while it's symbolic, that symbolism really matters because it enables states and companies and others to respond to Russian aggression and to recognize that the world sees it as aggression. It's not just individual states that are deploring it but the institution as a whole.\n\nFADEL: Now, the world has seen evidence of atrocities in areas that the Ukrainian military took back from Russia - bodies in the streets, mass graves discovered, accusations of mass rape. But now, Ukraine nor Russia are parties - state parties to the Rome Statute that established the International Criminal Court. So what type or what path to accountability could there be for these alleged crimes?\n\nHATHAWAY: Well, there's already investigations underway by the International Criminal Court. And as you said, Ukraine and Russia are not state parties to the Rome Statute, but Ukraine, back in 2014, agreed to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. And so that does give the International Criminal Court jurisdiction over war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide that have been committed in Ukraine since 2014. And so there is already significant investigations.\n\nI would expect that there will be prosecutions at the International Criminal Court. Those wheels turn slowly, but they do turn. And there will be, I expect, trials taking place in the International Criminal Court. In addition, the Ukrainian courts themselves have been already beginning trials for war crimes. So we have international accountability, but we also have accountability in Ukraine.\n\nFADEL: Professor Oona Hathaway of Yale University, thank you so much for joining us and exploring that question with us.\n\nHATHAWAY: Thank you for having me.\n\nCopyright © 2022 NPR.

    "At UN, Russia’s war in Ukraine is both text and subtext": "UNITED NATIONS (AP) — After two years of discourse dominated by the coronavirus pandemic, this year’s U.N. General Assembly has a new occupant of center stage: the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe pleas made by leaders from around the world for peace were both an altruistic amplification of besieged Ukrainians’ plight as well as born from self-interest. As several speeches made clear, the repercussions of the Russian invasion have been felt even thousands of miles away.\n\n“It is not just the dismay that we feel at seeing such deliberate devastation of cities and towns in Europe in the year 2022. We are feeling this war directly in our lives in Africa,” Ghanaian President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo said Wednesday. “Every bullet, every bomb, every shell that hits a target in Ukraine, hits our pockets and our economies in Africa.”\n\nThe speeches that elided any direct reference to the conflict were few, but the war resonated even in the absence of its direct invocation. Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, the president of Kazakhstan, never let the words “Ukraine” or “Russia” slip from his lips, but he made several seemingly pointed allusions.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe opened his remarks by painting a bleak picture of a world catapulted into a “new, increasingly bitter period of geopolitical confrontation” that’s engendered “the prospect of the use of nuclear weapons, and not even as a last resort.”\n\nJust hours later, Russian President Vladimir Putin — who is not attending the U.N. General Assembly — declared that he would not hesitate to use nuclear weapons to defend his country’s territory.\n\nRussia is a key ally of Kazakhstan, and the war in Ukraine has left the former Soviet country in an awkward spot. Tokayev performed a similar dance last week during Pope Francis’ visit, refusing to speak directly about Ukraine while generally decrying a morbid state of affairs.\n\nOn Tuesday, Tokayev laid out “three primordial principles: the sovereign equality of states, the territorial integrity of states, and peaceful coexistence between states.”\n\n“These three principles are interdependent. To respect one is to respect the other two. To undermine one is to undermine the other two,” he said.\n\nThe theme of territorial sovereignty resonated in other speeches, as countries who have faced infringements invoked their own traumas or cited the fate of Ukraine as a fear.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“We must not be silent in Bosnia and Herzegovina either. We owe that to our vivid memories of the horrors of war and aggression,” Šefik Džaferović, chair of the presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, said Wednesday. “The United Nations system was unable to prevent or stop the war in my country in the period between 1992 and 1995. Unfortunately, that happened again with Ukraine.”\n\nRussia has long been accused of trying to destabilize the Balkans anew — including Bosnia and Herzegovina. Džaferović’s turn at the rostrum came a day after Putin met with a Bosnian Serb separatist leader in Moscow.\n\nRussian peacekeepers have been stationed in Transnistria, a breakaway region in Moldova, since the end of a separatist war in 1992. Sandwiched between description of how the war in Ukraine — “our neighbor and friend” — has affected her country, Moldovan President Maia Sandu called for the “complete and unconditional withdrawal of Russian troops” from Transnistria.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPoland is the Ukrainian ally that has taken in the most refugees, and President Andrzej Duda made 34 references to the country in his speech Tuesday.\n\n“We must not forget those who are suffering,” Duda said. “Let us remember that six months of Russian aggression in Ukraine has brought the biggest humanitarian crisis in Europe since World War II.”\n\nBut Duda also highlighted how Ukraine has captured the world’s attention when many other momentous crises outside of Europe have not.\n\n“Were we equally resolute during the tragedies of Syria, Libya, Yemen? Did we not return to business as usual after two great tragedies of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the wars in the Horn of Africa, and while condemning the invasion of Ukraine, do we give equal weight to fighting mercenaries who seek to destabilize the Sahel and threaten many other states in Africa?” he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn the first day alone, Ukraine drew more than 150 mentions across speeches from leaders, including the U.N. secretary-general. Antonio Guterres opened the General Assembly by touting Ukraine and Russia’s deal — with the help of Turkey — over grain shipments as an example of successful multilateral diplomacy. The war was threaded throughout his speech, as he turned to its gloomier yields.\n\n“The fighting has claimed thousands of lives. Millions have been displaced. Billions across the world are affected,” he said.\n\nIn the lone video address to the General Assembly, for which he was given special dispensation, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy himself called out the seven countries who voted against the allowance: “Seven. Seven who are afraid of the video address. Seven who respond to principles with a red button. Only seven.”\n\nNone of those seven had yet spoken. But even if those countries had somehow prevailed, Slovakian President Zuzana Čaputová said it was incumbent on other countries to advocate for Ukraine.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“The democratic world and all of us must be a voice of Ukraine. The voice that won’t be silent, voice that will continue to testify about Russia’s crimes in Ukraine,” she said Tuesday. “The voice that will remember, and that will act — so no one is ever allowed to commit such atrocities again.”\n\n___\n\nFollow Mallika Sen at https://twitter.com/mallikavsen .

The commission is currently investigating such deaths in 16 towns and settlements,” Erik Mose, the commission's chairman, said. He said his team had received and was documenting “credible allegations regarding many more cases of executions.”\n\nThe investigators visited 27 towns and settlements, as well as graves and detention and torture centers; interviewed more than 150 victims and witnesses; and met with advocacy groups and government officials, he said.\n\n“Based on the evidence gathered by the commission, it has concluded that war crimes have been committed in Ukraine,” Mose said.\n\nHe said the team had also examined two incidents of ill-treatment against Russian soldiers by Ukrainian forces.\n\nThe commission plans to gradually expand its investigation, with areas of interest including allegations of filtration camps for people being detained or deported, the forced transfer of people, and allegations of expedited adoption of children.\n\n11:07am: Voting begins in Russia's annexation plan for swathes of Ukraine\n\nVoting is taking place in self-styled Donetsk (DPR) and the Luhansk People's Republics (LPR), which Russian President Vladimir Putin recognised as independent just before the invasion, and Russian-controlled areas of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions\n\n\"All of us have been waiting for a referendum on joining Russia for 8 long years,\" said Leonid Pasechnik, the Russian-backed leader of Luhansk. \"We have already become part of Russia.

Most, in fact, died under shelling as Russian forces attacked Izium in March\", reports Gulliver Cragg, FRANCE 24's correspondent in Ukraine.\n\n02:11\n\n7:11am: Referendums on Russian annexation start in occupied Ukraine territory\n\nReferendums on Russia's annexation began on Friday in Ukrainian territory controlled by Moscow, Russian news agencies reported, in what Kyiv and the West have denounced as a \"sham\" vote.\n\nVoting began at 0500 GMT on Friday and was due to end Tuesday in four regions controlled entirely or in part by Russian troops – Donetsk and Lugansk in the east and Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south.\n\n6:24am: Four Ukraine regions prepare to hold referendums on joining Russia\n\nFour areas of Ukraine controlled by Russia and pro-Moscow forces were preparing to hold referendums on Friday on joining Russia, votes widely condemned by the West as illegitimate and a precursor to illegal annexation.\n\nRussian-installed leaders on Tuesday announced plans for the ballots, a challenge to the West that could sharply escalate the war. The results are seen as a foregone conclusion in favour of annexation, and Ukraine and its allies have made clear they will not recognise the outcomes.\n\nVoting in the Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia provinces, representing about 15% of Ukrainian territory, is due to run from Friday to Tuesday.\n\nUkraine this month launched a counteroffensive that has recaptured large swathes of territory, seven months after Russia invaded and launched a war that has killed thousands, displaced millions and damaged the global economy. The referendums had been discussed for months by pro-Moscow authorities but Ukraine’s recent victories prompted a scramble by officials to schedule them.\n\n3:27am: Russian men fleeing draft arrive in Turkey\n\nTurkey is a relatively straightforward destination for Russians, who can still obtain three-month tourist visas at the airport. Many of the men fleeing the draft don’t know if they’ll return.

    "Two US veterans back in Alabama after Russian captivity in Ukraine": "Two military veterans from Alabama who volunteered to defend Ukraine from Russian invaders but were captured are back home, according to a statement provided to the Guardian on Sunday.\n\nThe statement from the family of Alex Drueke, 40, said he and Andy Tai Ngoc Huynh, 27, were among 10 foreign nationals included in a prisoner swap between Ukraine and Russia that was mediated by the Saudi Arabian government.\n\nAfter Drueke and Huynh underwent a medical examination and were cleared to travel, their families arranged for the pair to fly commercially from the Saudi capital, Riyadh, to New York. From New York they flew to Birmingham, arriving shortly after noon on Saturday, the Drueke family statement said.\n\nDrueke’s mother, Lois “Bunny” Drueke, and Huynh’s fiancee, Joy Black, met the pair in New York and accompanied them home to Alabama.\n\nDrueke’s aunt, Dianna Shaw, who has served as a spokesperson for the two families, said the two men were “in excellent spirits”. She provided a picture of them relaxing at a bar in Birmingham, 41st Street Pub & Aircraft Sales.\n\nShaw said the families would focus on the two men’s health before they underwent interviews with US and Ukraine government officials “to document their treatment while in captivity”.\n\nA statement attributed to Huynh said he and Drueke survived in captivity thanks in part to knowing people in Alabama and elsewhere in the US were praying for them.\n\n“That’s what got us through,” the statement said. “I have no regrets about going.”\n\nHuynh said the men’s captors made them say things to Russian media that were insincere.\n\n“Anyone who knows us would understand that wasn’t us,” the statement said.\n\nDrueke said he wanted “to thank everyone who helped secure our freedom”, including the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken.\n\n“Whether you called your congresspeople, told a neighbor about us, prayed for us, whatever you did, you helped make this possible,” Drueke said.\n\nThe statement from Drueke’s family said his first request upon returning to Alabama was for a beer and a reunion with his dog, Diesel, a 100lb mastiff. Huynh asked to eat his favorite fast food and to get a haircut he could show off at church on Sunday with Black.\n\nDrueke completed two tours of combat with the US army in Iraq – leaving him with post-traumatic stress disorder – before going to Ukraine via Poland in April. He taught Ukrainian soldiers how to use weapons from other countries in their fight against the Russian invasion, which began on order of Vladimir Putin in February.\n\nA member of Drueke’s unit called his mother and told her her son and Huynh were captured during a gunfight on 9 June, north of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city.\n\nDrueke and Huynh, who served with the US marines, were taken to a detention center in the Ukrainian city of Donetsk, which has been under Russian control.\n\nThey later appeared in Russian media clips, Huynh purporting to be against war and Drueke describing how he surrendered without firing a shot.\n\nThe statement from Shaw said Drueke and Huynh’s families “will continue to advocate for support for Ukraine”.\n\n“If the democracy of Ukraine falls to Russian dictatorship, then free Europe is in peril, and the United States could be too,” the statement said.\n\nUS officials including Joe Biden have discouraged Americans from volunteering to defend Ukraine. While the US is helping Ukraine by providing billions of dollars in weapons and other resources, officials have warned they are limited in their ability to help US citizens in cases where things go wrong there.\n\nMany US nationals have nonetheless travelled to Ukraine. A handful have been killed.",
    "Ukraine urges EU to help make emergency food routes permanent": "A combine harvests wheat in a field near the village of Zghurivka in Kyiv region, Ukraine August 9, 2022. REUTERS/Viacheslav Musiienko\n\nBRUSSELS, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Ukraine on Monday urged the European Union to support its plans to make the emergency paths for grain exports through the bloc permanent, with investment in at least five border terminals and a pipeline through which sunflower oil would flow.\n\nUkraine's agriculture minister Mykola Solsky told EU counterparts and the European Commission his country needed financial support to reduce its reliance on Black Sea exports that Russia had blocked and could hinder again.\n\nIts grain and sunflower seed exports have risen from 200,000 tonnes in the month after Russia's Feb. 24 invasion to 4.5 million tonnes in August, helped by a July deal to unblock ports, but most still following overland corridors through Europe.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\n\"We think these corridors should become stable and permanent,\" Solsky told a news conference after a meeting in Brussels.\n\nHe said Ukraine needed help to increase its fleet of trucks, adding a rise to 16,000 from 12,000 now could allow 10-20 million tonnes of cereals to cross land borders per year.\n\nUkraine, one of the world's largest grain exporters, normally supplies around 45 million tonnes of grain to the global market per year.\n\nFive border terminals should be built, costing $25-30 million each. The cost of a sunflower oil pipeline would depend on its route.\n\nSolsky recognised shipping was cheaper, but for crops in western Ukraine the distance to Baltic ports was no further than to the Black Sea, where Ukraine would face an \"unpredictable neighbour\" even after the war.\n\n\"To have an alternative route is a must, routes through friendly democratic countries in order to continue business,\" he said.\n\nAgriculture commissioner Janusz Wojciechowski said he would ask the EU executive to assess ways for the bloc to finance such initiatives.\n\nplummeting exports for the 2022-2023 season have driven up global food prices and prompted fears of shortages in Africa and the Middle East.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nReporting by Philip Blenkinsop\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

    "Orthodox Church leader says Russian soldiers dying in Ukraine will be cleansed of sin": "Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Russia conducts the Orthodox Christmas service at the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow, Russia, January 6, 2022. REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov\n\nSept 26 (Reuters) - The head of the Russian Orthodox Church has said that Russian soldiers who die in the war against Ukraine will be cleansed of all their sins, days after President Vladimir Putin ordered the country's first mobilisation since World War Two.\n\nPatriarch Kirill is a key Putin ally and backer of the invasion. He has previously criticised those who oppose the war and called on Russians to rally round the Kremlin.\n\n\"Many are dying on the fields of internecine warfare,\" Kirill, 75, said in his first Sunday address since the mobilisation order. \"The Church prays that this battle will end as soon as possible, so that as few brothers as possible will kill each other in this fratricidal war.\"\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\n\"But at the same time, the Church realises that if somebody, driven by a sense of duty and the need to fulfil their oath ... goes to do what their duty calls of them, and if a person dies in the performance of this duty, then they have undoubtedly committed an act equivalent to sacrifice. They will have sacrificed themselves for others. And therefore, we believe that this sacrifice washes away all the sins that a person has committed.\"\n\nRussia says it is calling up some 300,000 additional troops to fight in Ukraine, in a mobilisation drive that has stoked public anger, led to an exodus of military-age men and triggered protests across the country.\n\nKirill's support for the war in Ukraine has deepened a rift between the Russian branch of the Orthodox Church and other wings of Orthodoxy around the world. Pope Francis, head of the Catholic Church, has been a vocal opponent of the war, and has appeared to scold Kirill's position in several public addresses, including earlier this month when he said God does not support war.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nReporting by Reuters; Editing by Mark Trevelyan\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
