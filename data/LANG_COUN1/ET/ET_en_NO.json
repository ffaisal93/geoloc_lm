    "Norway cancels Coast Guard visit to Murmansk": "It was Lt. Gen. Stanislav Maslov, the powerful chief of FSB‚Äôs Border Guard Directorate, that in April, seven weeks after Russia‚Äôs onslaught on Ukraine, announced the planned port call by a Norwegian Coast Guard vessel to the Arctic port of Murmansk.\n\nThe news made media headlines in northern Russia at a time when the country‚Äôs uniformed services were frozen out of most joint events with European neighbors.\n\nIt was, according to FSB, at a meeting between Lt. Gen. Maslov and the chief of the Norwegian Joint Headquarters, Lt. Gen. Yngve Odlo, the Coast Guard visit to Murmansk later in the year was agreed.\n\nThe meeting took place at Borisoglebsk, just across the Norwegian-Russian border in the north.\n\n‚ÄúIn light of the current situation, we don‚Äôt find it natural that such a visit by a vessel should take place,‚Äù says spokesperson with the Joint Headquarters, Thomas Gjesdal to the Barents Observer.\n\nGjesdal underlines that a physical meeting between Odlo and his Russian counterpart will take place.\n\nThe commanders in charge of the land and sea border between the two countries in the north meet annually.

    "Kindred will stay in Norway and appeal daily fines": "Kindred has announced that it will remain in the Norwegian market, and appeal regulator Lotteritilsynet's decision to impose daily fines on its operations.\n\nLotteritilsynet announced that it would pursue the fines ‚Äì of NOK1.198m (¬£103,700/‚Ç¨116,000/$111,700) for every day its Trannel subsidiary continues to operate in Norway ‚Äì earlier this month.\n\nThe fine would come into effect three weeks from the day the regulator decided to issue it ‚Äì which would be 5 October.\n\nEarlier this year, Lotteritilsynet warned Kindred to withdraw form the Norwegian market or pay this fine, but Kindred said it would stay in the market as the operator did not believe it was in breach of any laws.\n\nOn 23 September, Henrik Tj√§rnstr√∂m, CEO of Kindred, said that Kindred will appeal the fine.\n\n‚ÄúWe will appeal the decision of the Lotteritilsynet regarding the issuance of this sanction fee and will continue operating as usual, as long as the legal process is ongoing,‚Äù said Tj√§rnstr√∂m. ‚ÄúWe want to see how it pans out.‚Äù\n\nTj√§rnstr√∂m said that Kindred disagrees with the idea that it is operating in Norway illegally. While only two busnesses are licensed by Norwegian authorities to offer online gambling, Tj√§rnstr√∂m argued that Kindred was permitted to operate under European law as it holds a licence in Malta and is therefore covered by free movement of services in the European Economic Area.\n\n‚ÄúWe dispute the claim that we have operations in Norway,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúWe are licensed in Malta and believe that Norwegian customers under current European economic legislation have the right to play on foreign sites if they wish.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThere is nothing that sets Norway apart from other European states in that respect.‚Äù\n\nTj√§rnstr√∂m also reiterated his belief that Norway would soon begin steps to create a fully regulated model where private operators can apply for licences.\n\n‚ÄúAgain, time will tell as the process proceeds,‚Äù said Tj√§rnstr√∂m. ‚ÄúBut we are not doing anything wrong in Norway today.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe accept traffic from Norwegian customers who find us in Malta and that is part of the legal framework that in our opinion prevails here. That‚Äôs our position.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe are confident that we are doing nothing wrong and look forward to moving towards a locally regulated market in Norway as well.‚Äù\n\nIn July, Kindred lost an earlier lawsuit regarding the fine and its presence in Norway, though it then took this to a higher court to be appealed.",

    "Norway Wind Farm Might Close‚ÄîBecause It‚Äôs Too Windy": "Parts of wind turbines have fallen in strong winds in Northern Norway. The Norwegian government has threatened to close down the wind farm unless improvements are made.\n\nNorway is no stranger to renewable energy. Despite the economic boom of oil and gas, much of the country‚Äôs domestic energy use comes from hydropower. Recent years have seen more wind turbines pop up across the country.\n\nBut there have been problems. Local opposition has delayed or even stopped many projects. Now, technical problems at a large wind farm in the north of Norway threaten its closure.\n\nSince 2020, at least seven objects from the wind turbines at the √Önstadbl√•heia wind farm near Sortland have fallen to the ground in strong winds. The Norwegian Directorate of Water and Energy (NVE) is taking the situation seriously.\n\nIn fact, NVE has given formal notice that the facility will be closed if it cannot be repaired by 10 October. ‚ÄúWe record repeated falling objects from the turbines linked to strong winds. This should not happen,‚Äù said NVE section manager Anne Johanne Kr√•kenes to NRK.\n\nA very windy location\n\nThe 14 turbines of √Önstadbl√•heia wind power plant are located on a hilltop in Sortland municipality, part of the Vester√•len islands.\n\nVester√•len is known for high winds and harsh weather.\n\nThe northern archipelago is known as a very windy place, so in theory wind turbines are the ideal solution for sustainsble energy.\n\n‚ÄúThe weather and wind in Vester√•len is probably one of the toughest things you can subject such machinery to,‚Äù said a power plant spokesperson to NRK.\n\nUnder normal operating conditions, √Önstadbl√•heia produces around 140-150 gigawatt hours of electricity a year. This corresponds to the annual energy consumption of around 7,500 Norwegian households.\n\nAn unusual situation\n\nAny wind power plant located on the coast of Northern Norway must be designed to withstand strong winds and harsh weather.\n\nNevertheless, strong winds and falling ice have caused the cover, panels and other parts to fall to the ground. This presents an onvious danger to local people and animals.\n\nNVE described the situation as ‚Äúunusual‚Äù and something they have not seen at other similar wind power plants. ‚ÄúThey have made some improvements. But we note that unwanted incidents still occur,‚Äù said Kr√•kenes.\n\nTechnicians are now busy installing new covers at the wind power plant. But its very much the last chance for the wind farm. Many locals wouldn‚Äôt be disappointed to see its closure.\n\nUnhappy locals\n\nEditor of the local newspaper, Morten Berg-Hansen, said many people were skeptical about the wind farm.\n\n‚ÄúIn the last two years it has not been safe to travel on the mountain. Although the facility is now being equipped for the future, and the surrounding area made safe, the reputation is damaged,‚Äù he said.",
    "Norway August Oil Production Rebounds": "grandriver\n\nA guest post by Ovi\n\nTypically, the POB posts have a theme. However, due to EIA schedule changes for issuing their reports and missing EIA reports, this post contains oil production updates for several Non-OPEC countries, plus the September DPR report. The country updates come from a combination of official country websites and news articles.\n\nThe Norway Petroleum Directorate (NPD) reported that production rebounded from June to July to 1,664 kb/d and then rose to 1,773 kb/d in August. (Red markers.). According to the NPD: ‚ÄúOil production in August was 3.1 percent lower than the NPD‚Äôs forecast and 4.7 percent lower than the forecast so far this year.‚Äù\n\nThe rebound from the June low is due to the end of summer maintenance and possibly the start up of the second phase of the Johan Sverdrup field along with some other small fields.\n\nAccording to OPEC: ‚ÄúFor 2022, production growth is expected to decrease by 43 tb/d y-o-y to average 2.0 mb/d. Norwegian liquid output dropped by 12% in 2Q22 to 1.74 mb/d, mainly because of maintenance at offshore platforms. In addition to some small start-ups, growth is expected in 4Q22, following the return from maintenance and second-phase production start-up of the Johan Sverdrup field.\n\nFor 2023, Norwegian liquids production is forecast to grow by 0.24 mb/d, unchanged from the previous month, to average 2.2 mb/d. Plenty of projects, from small to large, are scheduled to ramp up in 2023 in the Njord, Nova, Ringhorne, Alvheim, Oseberg and Snohvit fields. However, Johan Sverdrup is projected to be the main source of increased output for the year, making up roughly 35% of total Norway‚Äôs crude and condensate output.‚Äù\n\nChina reported that its output decreased in August to 3,989 kb/d, a drop of close to 200 kb/d from June. (Red markers)\n\nChina may be close to its current maximum production level of close to 4,000 kb/d. To offset declines, the national oil company is investing in conventional wells and also drilling for Shale Oil. See Below.\n\nAccording to OPEC: ‚ÄúNatural decline rates are expected to be offset by the Chinese national oil company‚Äôs considerable investments. Tianjin, Xinjiang, Heilongjiang, and Shaanxi were the main producing provinces in the first half of the year. Chinese companies expect additional growth through more in-fill wells and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects.\n\nFor 2023, y-o-y growth of 30 tb/d is forecast for an average of 4.5 m/d, with Bozhong 29-6, Wushi 17-2 and Kenli 10-1N planned to come on stream under the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC). At the same time, ramp-ups are expected from the Changqing, Jilin and Liaohe projects, which are managed by Petro China. The new projects will slightly offset declines from the mature onshore production base.‚Äù\n\nAccording to this source, China‚Äôs CNOOC has found shale oil in its South China Sea exploration well for the first time.\n\n‚ÄúCNOOC believes that the Beibu gulf contains 8.76 billion barrels of shale oil, and claimed that the wildcat well flowed 20 cubic metres/day (m¬≥/d) (125.8 b/d) of shale oil and 1,589m¬≥/d (56,092 ft^3/d) of natural gas, which the Chinese oil giant is calling a commercial discovery.‚Äù\n\nAccording to this source, August production fell after rebounding in July. The article just reports Crude oil production. Consequently the August number shown in is an estimate based on the percentage drop and a typical C + C to C ratio using earlier EIA data.\n\n‚ÄúThe fall in output was due to a sharp decline in production in the giant Kashagan oil field after a gas leak early in August, as well as planned output curbs in the Tengiz field due to regular maintenance.‚Äù\n\nMexico‚Äôs oil production increased by 10 kb/d in August to 1,797 kb/d. This is the third increase since May. Note that the red markers will be reduced by the EIA by close to 80 kb/d. Pemex reported production for May was 1,775 kb/d. The EIA reduced it to 1,695 kb/d, a reduction of 80 kb/d, due to a different definition for C + C.\n\nAccording to this source, August production fell by 30 kb/d from July‚Äôs output of 10,460 kb/d to 10,430 kb/d. In addition, this source revised down the original June output from 10,760 kb/d to 10,667 kb/d, a downward revision of 93 kb/d.\n\nAccording to this source, UK production dropped in May to 701 kb/d and then rebounded in July to 734 kb/d. Clearly UK production is in decline.\n\nGuyana added an additional 30 kb/d of production in August to reach new high of 390 kb/d. According to the chart below, the operating companies appear to be ahead of schedule on production.\n\nGuyana production schedule.\n\nThis chart shows Saudi Arabia‚Äôa oil stocks starting in 2019. In October 2015, SA had 326 million barrels in storage. Between then and January 2019, their stocks were reduced by 126 M barrels. During most of 2021, stocks bounced around 132 M barrels. In 2022, they have slowly risen to 142 M barrels in July\n\nOn September 23, 2022, WTI settled below the psychological level of $80/b. OPEC has stated that $80/b Brent is a fair price for both producers and consumers. More recently, some OPEC spoke persons have indicated their preferred level has drifted up to $90/b.\n\nRigs and Fracs\n\nThe rig story continues to be that the US Rig count has been holding steady at close to 545 rigs for the past seven weeks. In the week ending September 26, the rig count was unchanged from the previous week at 545. That was down six rigs from July 29 when 551 were operating.\n\nThe Permian rose by 1 rig to 322 and is down 9 rigs from a high of 331 on July 1. Note that 59% of the Hz rigs are located in the Permian.\n\nTexas dropped by 2 to 304 and is essentially unchanged relative to May 20 when 303 were operating.\n\nAfter New Mexico dropped 7 rigs in the first week of August to 96, the rig count has slowly increased to back above 100 to 101. The general trend in the New Mexico Permian has been to add an average of 0.57 rigs per week. This contrasts with the overall Permian trend shown above which has been in a slight down trend.\n\nFrac spreads have not shown any growth over the last six months. A high of 290 was reached on February 25 and was not surpassed till July 29, 295. For the week ending September 23, 1 frac spread was added for a total of 288.\n\nDrilling Productivity Report\n\nThe Drilling Productivity Report (DPR) uses recent data on the total number of drilling rigs in operation along with estimates of drilling productivity and estimated changes in production from existing oil wells to provide estimated changes in oil production for the principal tight oil regions. The September DPR forecasts production to October 2022 and the following charts are updated to October 2022.\n\nAbove is the total oil production projected to October 2022 for the 7 DPR basins that the EIA tracks. Note that DPR production includes both LTO oil and oil from conventional wells.\n\nThe September DPR report has downwardly revised the April to September production forecast. The original forecast for August 2022 was 9,069 kb/d. The revised estimate for August is 8,845 kb/d, a downward revision of 224 kb/d. Of the 224 kb/d, 59 kb/d can be attributed to the DPR revising the Bakken April output down by 59 kb/d due to the April/May storm.\n\nThe DPR is projecting that oil output for October 2022 will increase by 132 kb/d to 9,116 kb/d. From April‚Äôs output of 8,352 kb/d to October‚Äôs 2022, output in the DPR basins is forecast to increase by 764 kb/d or by an average of 127 kb/d/mth.\n\nPermian output continues to increase. In October, production is expected to increase by 66 kb/d to a new high of 5,413 kb/d. From May to September, production is forecast to increase by 346 kb/d or at an average rate of 69.2 kb/d/mth. If the Permian were part of OPEC, at 5,413 kb/d it would be the second largest producer after Saudi Arabia.\n\nDuring August, 416 wells were drilled and 435 were completed in the Permian. (Note that August is the latest data for DUC info). The completed wells added 378 kb/d to August‚Äôs output for an average of 870 b/d/well. The overall decline was 292 kb/d which resulted in a net increase for Permian output of 86 kb/d. Of the 435 completed wells, 336 were required to offset the decline. The completion of 19 extra DUCs over the drilled wells contributed 16.5 kb/d of the overall 86 kb/d increase.\n\nOutput in the Eagle Ford basin has been showing an increasing trend since March 2022. For October, output is expected to increase by 26 kb/d to 1,250 kb/d. At the beginning of the year, 43 rigs were operating in the EF. As of September, 66 are operational and accounts for the increasing production.\n\nThe DPR forecasts Bakken output in October to be 1,204 kb/d an increase of 21 kb/d from September.\n\nThis chart shows the Bakken‚Äôs output as reported by the North Dakota government. July production was reported to be 1,027 kb/d down 28 kb/d from June. The DPR Bakken chart above shows July production to be 1,143 kb/d, 16 kb/d higher.\n\nOutput in the Niobrara continues to increase slowly. October output increased by 9 kb/d to 657 kb/d.\n\nDUCs and Drilled Wells\n\nThe number of DUCs available for completion in the Permian and the four major DPR oil basins has continued to fall every month since July 2020. Prior to July 2020 more wells were drilled than were completed. The last two data points show how the use of DUCs continues to slow and is further illustrated in the next chart.\n\nWhile this chart is titled ‚ÄúExcess of Completed Wells over Drilled‚Äù, it could also have been called ‚ÄúMonthly change in DUC completion rate‚Äù because the excess of completed wells in a given month is equal to the change in the DUC completion rate.\n\nIn these four primarily oil basins, the change in monthly completion rate of DUCs started slowing after peaking in March 2021. In August 2022, 9 fewer DUCs (2,571 to 2,562) remained than in July. Similarly the monthly completion rate for DUCs in the Permian continues to fall. In August, the number of remaining DUCs fell by 19 (1,180 to 1,161). Note that since Permian excess wells were greater than in all four basins combined, a few basins drilled more wells than were completed. For instance in the Niobrara, 119 wells were drilled and 110 were completed.\n\nIn the Permian, the monthly completion rate has been showing signs of slowing since the recent March peak of 444. This is consistent with the frac spread chart shown above where there has been no growth in frac spreads since February.\n\nIn August 435 wells were completed, 4 fewer than in July and 9 fewer than in March. During August, 416 new wells were drilled, a decrease of 2 over July. This is the first time that there was a MoM drop in drilled wells. The gap between drilled and completed wells in the Permian has reached a new current low of 19 DUCs, which is the same as reported in the previous chart.\n\nOriginal Post\n\nEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.",
    "NEP Norway Expands SMPTE ST 2110 Operation": "NEP Norway Expands SMPTE ST 2110 Operation\n\nStory Highlights\n\nMediaproxy has continued its working relationship with outside broadcast and playout facilities group NEP by supplying its LogServer software for SMPTE ST 2110 recording at its Norwegian operation.\n\nNEP Norway first began using Mediaproxy software in 2017, when it chose LogServer for its next generation compliance recording on the SDI channels distributed from its playout center. This replaced a custom-built system and when the company needed a logging system for new ST 2110 services, the decision was taken to expand the installation, which was facilitated thanks to easy software-based integration for uncompressed IP video sources.\n\nThe new channel platform was installed in the second quarter of this year and as well as compliance monitoring it is also used to check problems on already-broadcast programs, while the As-run feature provides a record for advertisers of what has been sent to air.\n\nMediaproxy LogServer is a software-based IP logging and analysis system that supports SMPTE ST 2110, NMOS and SCTE ad-insertion. Delivering reliable compliance monitoring and recording of program output to meet broadcast standards and regulations, it can integrate seamlessly with cloud, virtual or on-premises workflows. The platform also supports video, audio and real-time data from sources including 4K, HDR, 10-bit, HEVC, TSoIP, SMPTE 2110, Zixi and SRT.\n\nNEP Norway technical manager Rune Olsen sees the key benefits of LogServer as being its ease of use and stability, plus excellent support from Mediaproxy. ‚ÄúThe software has worked without a hitch from the get-go and Mediaproxy is very fast in responding to any questions we may have,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe interface is also very easy and efficient to use. It just works and does the work it is supposed to do.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe are very pleased to continue our association with NEP Norway, which has entered a new and exciting phase in its business development by expanding into SMPTE ST 2110,‚Äù comments Mediaproxy‚Äôs Rajesh Patel, Vice President of Sales and Solutions for Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA). ‚ÄúOur company has been involved in the development of ST 2110 from the very start through our membership of AIMS. While it is now established and widely used in broadcasting, ST 2110 continues to be a leading edge technology that we at Mediaproxy are supporting through investment in engineering that allows us to fulfil customer demands for new technologies very quickly.‚Äù",
    "Norway open to gas price caps": "Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St√∏re, left, with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres at the U.N. Gernal Assembly in New York | Craig Ruttle/Pool/EPA-EFE\n\nNEW YORK ‚Äî Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St√∏re says his country is open to the previously unthinkable step of imposing price caps on gas to rein in Europe‚Äôs energy crisis.\n\nAs political leaders, activists and philanthropists piled on the pressure Wednesday to act to limit climate change at U.N. General Assembly events, St√∏re told POLITICO that ‚Äúno solution should be off the table,\" when asked about a push by some European governments for gas price caps.\n\n\"No proposal, no idea\" is off limits, he said. \"We really have to work on this together.\"\n\nSt√∏re sees Europe‚Äôs energy crisis as the key plank of what he called ‚ÄúPutin‚Äôs war on Europe. They have a military campaign in Ukraine, and they have an energy war in Europe.\"\n\nWhile many European governments support a price cap ‚Äî including Italy, Poland Belgium, Greece and Sweden ‚Äî some governments, like Germany, have concerns. With gas in short supply and high demand, some exporters may be tempted to send their gas to other parts of the world if the EU imposes a price cap.\n\nSt√∏re himself is skeptical that a price cap would achieve its aims, ‚Äúbecause the danger of doing that is that you may limit supply,‚Äù instead of nudging consumption down, he said. He prefers to soften the pain of high energy prices through ‚Äúredistribution mechanisms,‚Äù such as tax credits or welfare payments.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S√°nchez told POLITICO earlier this week that other radical policy options need to be considered. S√°nchez thinks governments need to learn from COVID-19 pandemic responses and coordinate better. ‚ÄúWhy don't we centralize gas purchases, as we did with the vaccines?‚Äù he said.\n\nNorway, a major fossil fuel exporter, is struggling to balance the effects of Russia‚Äôs war in Ukraine alongside the country‚Äôs commitment to go green.\n\n‚ÄúThese very high energy prices in Europe are not good for Norway,‚Äù St√∏re said. ‚ÄúThese are our allies and partners. We are not served by their economies being rocked,‚Äù he added.\n\nWhile high prices drive up Norway‚Äôs tax revenues ‚Äî oil and gas companies pay a 78 percent tax to the Norwegian treasury ‚Äî they drive up domestic prices too. But St√∏re is undeterred when it comes to making Norway transition to green energy. ‚ÄúWe need to scale up the energy transition,‚Äù he said.\n\nS√°nchez is backing Norway, telling fellow leaders not to get distracted by Russian President Vladimir Putin‚Äôs energy tactics: ‚ÄúWe have a bigger crisis with climate change,‚Äù he told POLITICO.\n\nFor now, that transition is unaffordable in many parts of the world. A new Global Leadership Council, co-chaired by St√∏re and Rockefeller Foundation President Rajiv Shah, aims to change that.\n\n‚ÄúSix billion people live in energy poverty, and as long as they are energy poor, that will be a major stumbling block for us moving forward on climate,‚Äù St√∏re said.\n\nThe council met for the first time Wednesday and is part of the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet. Its members include World Bank President David Malpass, International Energy Agency boss Fatih Birol, the heads of development banks and Bank of America‚Äôs Anne Finucane.\n\nOther groups in New York for the U.N. General Assembly are pushing to change the tone of climate debates, worried that climate action is increasingly becoming a victim of political polarization.\n\nHannah Jones, CEO of British Prince William's Earthshot Prize for environmental work, said this fear is a driving force behind the prince‚Äôs climate activism. ‚ÄúHe felt really clearly that if we didn't bring urgent optimism into the conversation, we risk people shutting down on us, and not being able to move forward and not take action,\" Jones said.\n\nThe prince had planned to be in New York to announce the winners of the Earthshot Prize, but the trip was canceled due to the death of his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nFight over the future\n\nThe fraught nature of climate debates was on full display Tuesday.\n\nClimate activist and former U.S. Vice President Al Gore tore into Malpass, demanding his replacement as World Bank president for what Gore described as a lack of climate action at the bank.\n\nSpeaking onstage in New York, Malpass repeatedly declined to say he agreed with the scientific consensus that the planet‚Äôs climate is changing dangerously. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a scientist,‚Äù Malpass said.\n\nNon-state actors also launched a deluge of climate commitments Wednesday. Amazon and Water.org announced a partnership to provide access to safe water for 100 million people, while a coalition of large companies including Ikea and Unilever committed to taking their most polluting vehicles off the road, and transitioning toward zero-emissions vehicles by 2040.\n\nAntha Williams, head of Bloomberg Philanthropies, which hosted the Earthshot Innovation Summit Wednesday, said the world needs action at all levels to have any hope of sticking to the Paris climate agreement. ‚ÄúWe need multilateral collaboration between nation states now more than ever, but they alone are not going to get it done,‚Äù she said.\n\nJones sees the process of identifying the local solutions from Earthshot Prize winners as an important step to change on a bigger scale. \"We are a global search engine. We scour the earth for incredible solutions with an eye to diversity and representation,\" Jones said.\n\nThe goal, she added, is ‚Äúfinding those solutions from the Global South by people that wouldn't be walking down Sand Hill Road [in Silicon Valley] and bumping into a venture capitalist.‚Äù\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres will push national leaders to make further commitments at an informal leaders roundtable on climate action.\n\nSt√∏re offered fulsome praise to the climate efforts of U.S. President Joe Biden, including the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act. ‚ÄúI can only salute him,‚Äù St√∏re said.",

    "Norway renews commitment to World Heritage Leadership": "Initiated in 2016, the World Heritage Leadership Programme aims to improve heritage practices in the culture and nature sectors. It provides guidance and tools to conserve World Heritage effectively and fosters networks for peer learning.\n\nWorld Heritage Leadership empowers heritage practitioners across the globe with the tools and capacity to deliver excellence in the management of the planet‚Äôs most iconic places,‚Äù said Grethel Aguilar, IUCN Deputy Director General. ‚ÄúIUCN is proud to collaborate with ICCROM, and our many partners, on such a valuable initiative for the World Heritage community. We thank sincerely Norway for their continued engagement and support for this vital work.‚Äù\n\nIn its first phase running up to 2022, the programme successfully completed new and updated resources seen as essential for the effective management of World Heritage sites. These include the recently launched Guidance and Toolkit for Impact Assessment in a World Heritage context. The programme also held numerous courses in different regions and on various topics, such as nature-culture linkages, disaster risk reduction, and community engagement.\n\nIn its second phase, the World Heritage Leadership Programme will focus on strengthening regional networks, working with various actors and institutions from the local to global levels. One of its main aims will be to multiply capacity-building opportunities for heritage practitioners and improve access by delivering them in diverse languages and contexts.\n\nManaging World Heritage in the 21st century is a complex task and we need to build our own capacities to do our jobs better,‚Äù said ICCROM Director-General Webber Ndoro. ‚ÄúThe best way to do that is to learn from each other and support each other, tapping into a global family working together to protect and conserve World Heritage. We extend our deep gratitude to Norway for recognizing the pressing need to continue developing present and future generations‚Äô capacity to care for our precious World Heritage.‚Äù\n\nWorld Heritage sites are internationally recognised as places so valuable to humanity that they must be protected from one generation to the next. They include iconic sites such as the Great Barrier Reef, Machu Picchu, or the West Norwegian Fjords. Despite their high profile, they face increasing pressure from various threats such as natural disasters, conflict and unsustainable development. Climate change is the top threat to the 252 natural World Heritage sites listed up to 2020, according to the IUCN World Heritage Outlook.\n\nNorway‚Äôs continued support for World Heritage Leadership recognises that practitioners involved in the conservation of these exceptional sites have a crucial role to play in ensuring their effective management. Its commitment to the second phase of the programme extends to strengthening the capacity of heritage professionals of the next generation.\n\n‚ÄúWorld Heritage properties are global common goods. Norway attaches particular importance to the capacity-building work to ensure that all countries are enabled to preserving and benefitting from their own cultural and natural heritage,‚Äù said Aleksander √òren Heen, State Secretary at the Norwegian Ministry of Climate and Environment. ‚ÄúGood, long-term management of a nation‚Äôs cultural and natural heritage is essential for sustainable development.‚Äù\n\nThe new phase of commitment was announced at the World Heritage Leadership Forum on 21 September 2022. High-level delegates at the event reflected on how capacity building has contributed to the first 50 years of implementation of the World Heritage Convention, and how to strengthen it in the future.",
    "Norway‚Äôs Family Immigration Permit Explained": "There‚Äôs a lot of confusion out there about the family immigration permit offered by Norway. Here‚Äôs what you need to know.\n\nAs anyone who has done it will surely agree, moving to any country is a complicated process. There‚Äôs a lot of different categories of residence permits with many terms and conditions, ifs and buts.\n\nOne of those conditions is related to whether you can bring your family with you or not. A work permit is an individual permit and doesn‚Äôt automatically mean your partner or other close family member can accompany you.\n\nIf you‚Äôre planning on moving to Norway to work, your partner or children can usually join you but they will need to apply for a different permit.\n\nIntroducing family immigration\n\nNorway‚Äôs immigration rules offer a specific residence permit available for family members of someone who already holds a residence permit. This is known as family immigration.\n\nThere‚Äôs a lot of misinformation out there about what family immigration means. For example, we are often contacted by people who have Norwegian ancestry and assume the family immigration permit applies to them. This is not the case.\n\nThis article rounds up the basic principles of family immigration in Norway. The rules are different depending on the country of citizenship of the people involved, the family relationship, and the type of residence permit held by the person already living in Norway.\n\nAs always, the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration (UDI) has all the official information. You should verify what applies to your own circumstances on their website, as there are too many exceptions and conditions to cover every single on in this post.\n\nWho can apply for family immigration?\n\nThere are several categories of relation who can apply for a family immigration permit.\n\nPartners\n\nFirstly, if your spouse, long-term partner or cohabitant holds a residence permit in Norway, you are eligible to apply. You can usually do this at the same time as your partner applies for a skilled worker visa, and you should get your answer at the same time.\n\nMarriages of convenience and forced marriages are not permitted. Both partners must also have plans to live together in Norway. In the case of cohabitants, they must have lived together for at least two years and both be over the age of 24.\n\nIf the partner with residence in Norway is not an EU/EEA citizen, they must usually prove an income of NOK 300,988 per year and cannot have received financial aid from Nav in the prior 12 months.\n\nThere are reductions and/or exemptions to the income requirement for those who have been granted asylum in Norway. This is especially true within the first year as a refugee.\n\nChildren\n\nFor EU/EEA citizens, children under the age of 21 can join a parent or parents living in Norway by using the registration program for EU/EEA nationals.\n\nFor non-EU/EEA citizens, children under 18 can join a parent or parents living in Norway. The parent must have an income of at least NOK 300,988 and hold a valid work permit or study permit. If only one parent is living in Norway, the other parent must give their consent.\n\nAs with the rules for partners, there are exceptions to the income requirements for successful asylum seekers who wish to bring their children to Norway, but this must be done within the first year.\n\nParents\n\nFor EU/EEA citizens, a parent, grandparent, or great-grandparent who is already being supported by the family member in Norway is eligible to apply for family immigration. This doesn‚Äôt apply for those holding study permits.\n\nAs per the terms of the EU/EEA registration program, the parent will need to get a job, start a program of study, or prove they have sufficient funds.\n\nNon-EU/EEA parents of adult children living in Norway are usually not permitted to apply for family immigration. However, exceptions are made for a single parent that has no parents, children, or great-grandchildren in their home country. In this case, the income requirement applies to the child living in Norway.\n\nIt‚Äôs also possible for a parent to apply for family immigration in order to visit an adult child for up to nine months. This permit cannot be renewed, but it can be applied for again after one year of the permit expiring.\n\nOther family members\n\nThe rules for other family members coming to Norway vary considerably. As a general rule, other family members cannot join non-EU/EEA citizens living in Norway.\n\nUDI states that exceptions to this are assessed but they would only be granted when ‚Äústrong humanitarian considerations‚Äù apply.\n\nFor EU/EEA citizens, it‚Äôs possible for siblings without care providers to apply for family immigration. This also applies for family members with serious health problems and nursing needs, if the person living in Norway is the only person that can provide care.\n\nMoving to join a Norwegian citizen\n\nIf the family member already living in Norway is a Norwegian citizen, some of the rules are a little different.\n\nNon-EU/EEA spouses and cohabitants can apply for family immigration as long as they have previously lived together, are expecting a child together, or are planning to get married in Norway within the next six months. The income requirement applies to the Norwegian citizen.\n\nSimilar rules apply for parents and children of Norwegian citizens. In addition, a person who had a Norwegian parent when they were born can apply for family immigration, but they must prove an income of NOK 278,693. The Norwegian parent must have held Norwegian citizenship at the time.\n\nWhat can you do with a family immigration permit?\n\nIn general, family immigration permits allow you to work in Norway. They also allow you to apply for permanent residence after five years, should you meet the other requirements.\n\nEventually, you would be able to apply for Norwegian citizenship, should you meet all the other criteria such as language ability.\n\nSome people given family immigration permits can access free Norwegian language lessons, but do have an obligation to complete them. Free lessons are not available to those who do not have an obligation to complete them, including EU/EEA citizens.\n\nHow to apply for family immigration\n\nThe application process begins online at the UDI website. Depending on your circumstances you may be able to hand in the required documents at a police station in Norway, or at your nearest Norwegian Embassy or Consulate.\n\nApplicants must pay a substantial application fee. At present, this is NOK 10,500 for a first-time applicant. Renewals are a lot cheaper, and there are lower fees for some categories.\n\nThe documents you need for your application will be made clear to you during the application process on the UDI website.\n\nHow long does family immigration take?\n\nThere is no single waiting time for family immigration applications. It depends on many factors including the type of residence permit the person in Norway has, your family relationship, and where you hand in your application.\n\nIn very general terms, 3-4 months is common, but it can take up to 10 months in some cases.\n\nIf you submit an application for family immigration at the same time as your family member submits one for a work permit (for example), you should recieve the responses together.\n\nIn some cases, UDI may conduct additional investigations to verify identity and other circumstances. This could include an interview with the Norwegian police and even a DNA test to verify a family link. The waiting time for these cases varies considerably.\n\nIt is possible to appeal against a rejection, but this process is also a lengthy one. UDI states a waiting time of up to 12 months for appeals.\n\nProblems with family immigration permits\n\nEarlier this year, UDI identified several cases of fraud in family immigration applications. These included false income and employment claims.\n\nBoth UDI and the Immigration Appeals Board (UNE) sometimes see issues with the size of the salary and whether the job even exists. This most commonly occurs with construction jobs and the hospitality and service industry.",
    "Oslo: 9 Best Places To Visit In Oslo, Norway": "Attractions And Places To Visit In Oslo, Norway\n\nThere are several museums and galleries to visit in Oslo Norway. If you‚Äôre interested in art, you may want to check out the National Museum.\n\nThis museum holds Norway‚Äôs largest collection of art and contains works by notable European artists like Gauguin and Claudel.\n\nThe collection also includes works by 19th-century Norwegian artists like Christian Krohg and JC Dahl. The city is also home to the museum of Edvard Munch, the world‚Äôs most famous painter.\n\nIt exhibits his watercolors, private library, and other works. Visitors can enjoy free guided tours and participate in music and film screenings.\n\nWhile there, you can visit the Edvard Munch Museum, which contains over 1,200 pieces of Munch‚Äôs works. The Norwegian National Gallery is also worth visiting.\n\nThis museum holds pieces by artists from the 19th century to the present. The paintings are quite impressive.\n\nThe interior has a beautiful organ and a painted ceiling, while the exterior is constructed from red bricks.

    "Norway‚Äôs ‚ÄôSalmon Eye‚Äô Opens in Hardangerfjord": "Accessible only by ferry, the floating exhibition space is designed to inform visitors about aquaculture and the future of the seafood industry.\n\nEide Fjordbruk is an established salmon producer in Norway‚Äôs Hardangerfjord region. The third-generation owners Sondre and Erlend Eide wanted to remember their father while creating something of value.\n\nSalmon Eye launch event in the Hardangerfjord, Photo: Kvorning Design.\n\nThe result? Salmon Eye, a new floating installation and forum space that‚Äôs designed to educate visitors on sustainable seafood, fish farming and the production of Norwegian salmon.\n\nSeafood is a huge success story for Norwegian industry, second only to oil and gas. The export value of salmon is twice the amount of all other fish combined. However, there are critics of some of the industry practices.\n\nThe idea for the project began in 2019. Kvorning Design‚Äòs experimental plans were revealed in 2021 and the building completed in August 2022, in time for the unveiling event in the Hardangerfjord earlier this week.\n\nExperimental design becomes a reality\n\nBold architectural designs are nothing new these days, especially in Scandinavia. But very few of them actually become a reality.\n\nSalmon Eye exhibition centre in the Hardangerfjord. Photo: Kvorning Design.\n\nDanish firm Kvorning Design stated their gratitude to the Eide family for their trust and cooperation with the design and communications firm around the realization of the experiential design for Salmon Eye.\n\nThe basis for the design was a fish eye with a hole on top of the architecture. Based on this, the curved, floating architecture and art installation is covered in 9,500 stainless steel plates designed to imitate the appearance and colour of fish scales.\n\nSalmon Eye weighs 1,256 tonnes and is 25 meters in diameter. Also designed by Kvorning Design, the interior features 650 square metres of space. It‚Äôs divided into four floors, one of which is underwater.\n\nSalmon Eye as an educational space\n\nThe forum element of Salmon Eye is an immersive audio-visual space designed to inform visitors about the aquaculture of sea farming and what harms and protects the sea and its species.\n\nSalmon is an important export industry for Norway.\n\nAccording to Eide, it is designed to help visitors recognise the ocean as an important food source, educate them on seafood practices of today and what future standards in aquaculture might look like.\n\nPlanned events include talks that aim to inspire, share ideas, and discuss the importance of sustainable aquaculture with its guests.\n\nEide‚Äôs environmental push\n\nThe Salmon Eye is undoubtedly a passion project for the brothers Sondre and Erlend Eide, the third generation in the family‚Äôs business. With some critical of the environmental impact of salmon farming in Norway, Eide is hoping to change people‚Äôs minds.\n\nEide Fjordbruk was the first fish farming company to produce carbon-neutral salmon, and the first to present environmental accounts. The company has introduced all-electric boats and facilities.\n\nThe firm will shortly unveil a new technology known as ‚ÄúWatermoon‚Äù, which it states enables farming in the fjord and sea with no negative impact on the environment or climate.\n\nWhat do you think of the Salmon Eye?",
    "Coastal mayors from Norway‚Äôs Centre Party warn on salmon tax rumours": "Fish farming companies in Norway are bracing themselves for a possible new ‚Äúsalmon tax‚Äù next month.\n\nThe Oslo Labour coalition government will present the country‚Äôs national budget on 6 October and there are widespread reports that taxes on aquaculture industry profits will be hiked.\n\nThe reports led at the weekend to several Centre Party mayors urging the government not to proceed with such a plan.\n\nThere is no doubt that salmon farm profits have increased substantially this year on the back of soaring prices, but so too have costs, notably for energy, feed and labour.\n\nFish farming and conventional fishing provide an economic lifeline for many of Norway‚Äôs coastal communities.\n\nMayor Sigrun Wiggen Prestbakmo, who represents the Salangen municipality in the Troms and Finnmark region, told the national broadcaster NRK that the government should put an end to the tax rise rumours, saying it would be robbery on such communities.\n\nShe said: ‚ÄúI have told the municipal minister that if this is implemented, he must prioritise crisis packages along the coast, but the Ministry of Finance will not discuss what is in the budget until it is presented next month.‚Äù\n\nPrestbakmo said: ‚Äúthe state must find another way to plug the hole in the state budget‚Äù, arguing that ‚Äúif the government responds by slapping on more taxes then many jobs along the coast will be depleted within a few years‚Äù.\n\nGovernment spokeswoman Therese Riiser replied: ‚ÄúTax and duty changes will be presented in the state budget on 6 October. We will not comment on what it will contain until then.‚Äù",
    "To keep arming Ukraine, Norway may drop munitions stocks below required levels": "WASHINGTON ‚Äî Norway is considering letting stocks of key munitions drop below their required levels, accepting greater vulnerability in the short term as the price the northern European nation is willing to pay to keep up the flow of weaponry to Ukraine.\n\nThe move would coincide with a longer-term push to raise the required baseline for munitions stockpiles to new, higher levels down the road. In other words, Norway is prepared to take on short term risk to keep Russia tied up in Ukraine, while looking to expand stockpiles in the future when munition production is more readily available.\n\nThe idea was still conceptual, and would need approval of Norway‚Äôs parliament. But Norwegian defense minister Bj√∏rn Arild Gram, speaking to a small group of reporters while in Washington this week, said that getting the balance right between present and future planning is going to be a major focus over the coming months.\n\n‚ÄúWe are more looking how we can increase the stocks from previous levels. But we are looking into if you can take even more from our stocks in the short term to support Ukraine. And to then to refill it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúObviously we want to increase that even more, but maybe in the short term, we are donating.‚Äù\n\nAn aide to the minister noted that ‚Äúwe are at the point where we are looking to go lower because of the situation [in Ukraine] of course, but ‚Ä¶ longer term that is certainly pointing to an increase. So maybe [taking on] more risk now‚Äù with an eye towards the future.\n\n‚ÄúMore and more it will be about cooperating with industry and purchasing new equipment,‚Äù Gram added.\n\nRELATED: Norwegian air chief: Russia isn‚Äôt ‚Äô10 feet tall,‚Äô but don‚Äôt discount it\n\nThere is growing concern on both sides of the Atlantic about munition stocks and how quickly industry can replace the weapons being donated to Ukraine. In July, the defense minister from The Netherlands described the situation as everyone ‚Äústanding in line at the ammunition factories‚Äù and called for more coordination among industry. The Pentagon plans to host a meeting of European armaments leaders to figure out how best to coordinate such efforts, even as US firms struggle to keep up with demand for some of the highest-profile weapons being used by Kyiv.\n\nFor Norway, the majority of what has been sent to Ukraine was equipment that was being phased out of active use by the Norwegian military, Gram said. According to a Norwegian fact sheet, the following gear has been either shipped or is in the process of being shipped to Ukraine:\n\n4,000 M72 anti-tank weapons\n\n1,500 bulletproof vests, 5,000 helmets, 15,000 field rations, 1,000 protective masks with filters, 2,000 sleeping bags, 10,000 sleeping mats, some night vision equipment and some clothing\n\nApproximately 100 Mistral air defense missiles and a number of launchers\n\n22 M109 howitzers, including related gear, spare parts and ammunition\n\nMLRS long-range rocket artillery system, provided by a partnership between Norway and the United Kingdom\n\n14 Iveco LAV III Armored Vehicles\n\nApproximately 160 Hellfire missiles with supporting equipment\n\nIn addition to the MLRS, the Kingdom has teamed with the UK on three initiatives: training Ukrainian forces in the United Kingdom, jointly funding the acquisition of the Norwegian micro-drone Black Hornet system (Norway is contributing NOK 90 million, or $8.5 million USD, to that effort), and contributing NOK 400 million ($38.4 million) to a UK-led fund for procurement and transportation of weapons to Ukraine.\n\nAsked what might come next, Gram declined to go into detail.\n\n‚ÄúBeyond that, I won‚Äôt speculate too much in what can be future donations,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt will be a mix of what we take from our own stocks, what we buy from the industry, what we finance to other countries supplying Ukraine. So is will be a combination of that.‚Äù",

However, more local employees will be appointed in selected foreign stations in and outside Europe.\n\nAccording to the government, the increase in diplomats and local employees from Norway in some foreign missions is mainly related to the government‚Äôs aim to increase Norwegian exports.",
    "Wang Yi Meets with Foreign Minister Anniken Huitfeldt of Norway": "On September 21, 2022 local time, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with Norwegian Foreign Minister Anniken Huitfeldt on the sidelines of the United Nations (UN) General Assembly in New York.\n\nWang Yi said, pragmatic cooperation between China and Norway has made positive progress in recent years. Last year, bilateral trade increased by nearly 40 percent year on year. Free trade agreement (FTA) negotiations have entered the final stage, and a new version on avoidance of double taxation will soon be signed. In the face of world changes and chaos, stability and confidence are more important than gold. The two sides should respect each other and treat each other as equals, increase understanding and eliminate misunderstanding, maintain the sound momentum of sound and stable development of China-Norway relations, strengthen exchanges at all levels, and promote pragmatic cooperation to achieve more results. China is ready to work with Norway to strengthen communication and coordination in the United Nations and other multilateral institutions and jointly practice true multilateralism.\n\nHuitfeldt said that the Norwegian side is pleased that the two sides have overcome the pandemic and continued to advance bilateral relations. Norway and China have great potential for cooperation in such areas as climate change response, economic transformation, renewable energy, and green development. Norway looks forward to speeding up FTA negotiations and continuing to conduct constructive cooperation with China.\n\nWang Yi expressed, China has played an important role in promoting the conclusion of the Paris Agreement. China will continue to show its responsibility as a major country and shoulder its due responsibility for the future of humanity. We stay committed to the path of green, low-carbon, and sustainable development, and have set two ambitious goals of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality to achieve the largest reduction in carbon emission intensity in the world. We vigorously develop renewable energy, with electricity generated by wind and solar power ranking the first worldwide, as well as the world's largest production and sales of new energy vehicles. Developed countries are expected to honor their commitments and provide financial, technological, and capacity-building support to developing countries.\n\nHuitfeldt said that Europe is deeply worried about the current situation in Ukraine and hopes that China will play an important role. Wang Yi expounded on the principled position of the Chinese government and stressed that what President Xi Jinping has proposed that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries must be respected, the purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be fully observed, the legitimate security concerns of all countries must be taken seriously, and all efforts that are conducive to the peaceful settlement of the crisis must be supported is the fundamental guide for China in dealing with the Ukraine issue. The international community should support all efforts conducive to peace, and cope with the challenges brought by the spillover of the crisis to world economic recovery. China will continue to play a constructive role in promoting peace talks in its own way.",

    "Hurtigruten Norway launches its first hybrid ship": "Hurtigruten Norway has launched its first environmentally-upgraded battery-hybrid powered ship, MS Richard With. It is the first of seven in the Coastal Express fleet to be upgraded, and now features technology that will significantly reduce both CO2 and Nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions.\n\nAs part of a major effort to make Hurtigruten Norway‚Äôs fleet more sustainable, the company has invested nearly 100 million Euros towards green upgrades that will be implemented by early 2024.\n\nThis move follows its sister company, Hurtigruten Expeditions, introducing the world‚Äôs first battery-hybrid powered expedition ship, MS Roald Amundsen, in 2019. The expedition cruise brand now has three battery-hybrid powered ships in its fleet.\n\nBecoming a green company means investing in efforts with documented effects, such as the ones we are doing now. As a result, by next summer, we will have three upgraded hybrid ships sailing the coast, and our entire fleet will be more energy efficient, cutting CO2-emissions by 25% and NOx by 80%\n\nsaid Hedda Felin, CEO of Hurtigruten Norway.\n\nMS Richard With has gone through extensive upgrades and been retrofitted with battery packages, brand new engines, and new propulsion systems at Myklebust Yard in northwestern Norway. All Hurtigruten Norway‚Äôs seven ships will also be fitted with SCR systems that cut NOx emissions by a massive 80% by early 2024.\n\nThis is one of the largest environmental upgrades of its kind in Europe, and the largest in Hurtigruten‚Äôs history. The fact that we have made these upgrades at Myklebust Yard, with as much Norwegian technology as possible, is no coincidence\n\nMs. Felin stated, adding that ‚Äúour goal is to get to zero emissions, and the work to plan the next generation zero emission vessels has already started. Until that technology has been pioneered, we are investing heavily in giving our existing fleet a green upgrade with the best technology available today, but our plan is to have the first emission-free ship in our fleet by 2030, and we‚Äôre working hard on achieving that.‚Äù",

I heard it from India. I heard it from African colleagues. And I think that‚Äôs an important message because Russia has tried to say ‚ÄòNo, there are different views,‚Äô‚Äù St√∏re told The Associated Press on Thursday, following the morning‚Äôs U.N. Security Council meeting. ‚ÄúAnd of course, countries word their opinions in different ways. But in this there has been consistency. The war has to stop.‚Äù\n\nAs a NATO member whose border with Russia stretches well over 100 miles (just under 200 kilometers), Norway‚Äôs geographical and geopolitical location has proved relevant in the context of the crisis. It‚Äôs also an elected member of the Security Council.\n\nSt√∏re had a blunt assessment of the way Russian President Vladimir Putin has tried to justify Russia‚Äôs actions.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n‚ÄúThe narrative of President Putin when he is giving a reason for mobilizing and for continuing the war, I believe that narrative is false. It is not true,‚Äù St√∏re told the AP. ‚ÄúI mean, it‚Äôs based on Russia being under threat, pressure, being under some kind of attack by the West. I am a prime minister in a NATO country and bordering Russia, a European country, I belong to the West or whatever you may call it, but this is simply not true.‚Äù\n\nSt√∏re does not believe Russia poses a threat to Norway‚Äôs own territorial integrity, but labeled the aggression ‚Äúunacceptable.‚Äù He also censured Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov‚Äôs late arrival and early departure from the meeting.\n\n‚ÄúHe chose not to listen to any of the interventions. He spoke and he left after he had spoken, which is, to me, a sign of, in a way, insecurity,‚Äù he said.\n\nSince the war‚Äôs outbreak, Norway has supplanted Russia as Europe‚Äôs biggest supplier of natural gas. Norway has thus far resisted the European Union‚Äôs demand for gas price caps, with St√∏re telling the AP that the limits ‚Äúwould not resolve the fundamental issue, which is that there is a shortage of gas.‚Äù\n\nSt√∏re is a proponent of renewable energy sources, particularly offshore wind farms, and thinks that the conflict-driven energy crisis might accelerate the shift ‚Äî ‚Äúparadoxically, it will help.‚Äù\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNorway is a founding member of NATO and within the Schengen Area, but it is not a member of the European Union. While St√∏re‚Äôs party supports accession, the prospect has long been unpalatable to the Norwegian populace.\n\nSt√∏re says a ‚Äúpretty stable majority‚Äù prefers the status quo, but he has seen ‚Äúsome‚Äù movement in the opinion polls. Pointing to Sweden and Finland‚Äôs recent shift in policy, he said that the war has instead highlighted the importance of NATO.\n\nHowever, any decision on further sanctions of Russia would be taken in conjunction with Europe, St√∏re said.\n\nThe war and preceding tensions have absorbed much of Norway‚Äôs two-year term on the Security Council, but St√∏re ‚Äî a former foreign minister ‚Äî said he‚Äôs proud of the role his diplomats have played in trying to resolve other quagmires, including returning a U.N. presence to Afghanistan and access to humanitarian aid in Syria.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n‚ÄúWe have been able to be a kind of go-between. When the major powers have deep divergences, we can play that role.

    "Norway and the Geopolitics of Battery Minerals ‚Äì PRIO Blogs": "Batteries are as essential to the ‚Äúgreen‚Äù energy transition as wind parks, solar power, and electric cars. These green energy technologies all require vast amounts of minerals. Norway has the potential to be an important new supplier of batteries, but it has been surprisingly silent on the issue ‚Äì until now.\n\nFor some years, experts worldwide have pointed to a discrepancy between supply and demand in minerals critical for the ‚Äògreen‚Äô energy transition. Commodities like lithium, graphite, cobalt, and nickel are essential to produce batteries. But the global Covid-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine have pointed to serious bottlenecks in the supply of these critical minerals.\n\nChina has dominated the battery supply chain and is expanding its control over the various steps in that chain, from mining to refining to manufacturing batteries in China and abroad. Mining is often concentrated in poorer countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where 70% of the world‚Äôs cobalt is sourced. Such concentration heightens the dependency of European industries on resource-rich countries. The war in Ukraine has further aggravated mineral and metal supply issues, as Russian nickel supplies are now largely off-limits to Western battery manufacturers. Mineral self-sufficiency in Europe seems like a pipe dream, given the few mining sources and refining projects that currently exist on the continent.\n\nArendal ‚Ä¶ is also one of three sites where large-scale battery cell production is planned.\n\nTo address this highly political and strategic issue, the European Union has been mapping supply chains in order to develop strategies to access these materials. And Norway has begun to address the issue of the geopolitics of critical mineral supply. At this year‚Äôs Arendalsuka, an annual political festival, the topic added some pepper to last year‚Äôs battery euphoria. The southern Norwegian town of Arendal not only hosts Norway‚Äôs democratic dance floor, as the festival often is called, it is also one of three sites where large-scale battery cell production is planned. With the aim to make Norway nothing less than a ‚Äúgreen industrial and energy giant‚Äù through battery production and other ‚Äúgreen‚Äù technologies, the Norwegian government launched its battery strategy in June 2022.\n\nHow does Norway approach the critical raw material challenge?\n\nThe Minister of Trade and Industry, Jan Christian Vestre, not only wants Norway to become a battery giant but also a sustainable mining nation. His ministry is currently developing a new mineral strategy which promises both more mining as well as recycling of minerals and metals. However, the few planned mining projects are contested. A ‚Äúless visible‚Äù form of extraction proposed is seabed mining, spearheaded by the Petroleum Directorate. Internationally, though, this type of mining is highly disputed and not recommended by the EU.\n\nAs in many other European countries, establishing a robust mining sector in Norway will take time, is politically challenging due to its impacts, and would probably not satisfy the expected demand in time. Realistically, that leaves the Norwegian battery actors relying on raw materials from outside Europe for some time.\n\nIn a panel debate on critical raw materials at Arendalsuka, Parliamentarian and former Minister of Climate and Environment, Ola Elvestuen (V) acknowledged that the East-West polarisation will make cooperation on mineral and metal supplies unavoidable: ‚ÄúWe will have to be more strategic in our partnerships with Africa, South America and Southeast Asia. That is an essential component in the biggest challenge we are in, to protect freedom and democracy and to reach our climate goals‚Äù.\n\nIt remains to be seen what role strategic partnerships will be given when Norway‚Äôs mineral strategy is launched later this year. Despite the wish to be more self-reliant, we should be realistic and recognise Norway‚Äôs dependence on mining elsewhere, particularly in the Global South, if battery production is to become a relevant industry for the country.\n\nAnna-Sophie Hobi is a PhD candidate at NMBU and associated with the Green Curses project at PRIO.",
    "‚ÄòSelfish‚Äô Norway accused of Ukraine war-profiteering": "Hansson, a former leader of the Norwegian Green Party, isn‚Äôt buying the government‚Äôs argument | Hakon Mosvold Larsen/AFP via Getty Images\n\nPress play to listen to this article Voiced by Amazon Polly\n\nOSLO ‚Äî Norwegian opposition party lawmaker Rasmus Hansson has a harsh message for his country‚Äôs government: The war in Ukraine isn‚Äôt a fair reason to demand higher gas prices.\n\nSanctions-hit Russia is weaponizing gas deliveries, hoping to hurt Ukraine's EU allies now scrambling to cut their reliance on Russian energy exports. That's sending the price of natural gas soaring ‚Äî up sevenfold over the last year.\n\nNow Norway has supplanted Russia as the EU's largest source of gas, and torrents of cash are pouring into the country.\n\nOslo expects around ‚Ç¨94 billion in net income from its petroleum industry this year, a rise of around ‚Ç¨65 billion from last year. Norway‚Äôs sovereign wealth fund, which manages the country's petroleum earnings, has a current value of around ‚Ç¨1.2 trillion, or around ‚Ç¨250,000 per citizen.\n\nThat flood of money is turning into both a domestic and a foreign political problem.\n\nThe Nordic state‚Äôs center-left government ‚Äî made up of the Social Democrats and Center Party ‚Äî says it has shown solidarity with a 1.4 billion cubic meter production hike at three key fields in March, which is sending more gas to the EU. It argues Norway shouldn‚Äôt be blamed for market forces beyond its control.\n\nBut Hansson, a former leader of the Norwegian Green Party, isn‚Äôt buying the government‚Äôs argument.\n\nHe called it ‚Äúmorally wrong‚Äù to profit from price rises driven primarily by war and argued that Norway also risks damaging relations with key European trading partners by forcing them to pay such high gas prices.\n\nToo much money?\n\n‚ÄúWe think Norway is being short-sighted and too selfish,‚Äù Hansson said in an interview in his office overlooking the parliament in the capital Oslo. ‚ÄúWe are getting a windfall profit which is very big, but the question is does that money belong to us as long as the most obvious reason for that price increase and that extra income is the disaster that has befallen the Ukrainian people?‚Äù\n\nHansson wants to see the extra money go into a solidarity fund that would be used to rebuild Ukraine after the war. He said experts should set what should be considered a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù gas price and everything above that should be seen as war profits and given away.\n\nBrussels has a similar idea. During an emergency summit of EU energy ministers last week, several countries called for setting a price cap on all gas coming into the EU; the European Commission wants such a measure directed only against Russia.\n\nOn Wednesday, Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen said she was discussing a ‚Äútask force‚Äù with Norway to look at ‚Äúhow are we able to lower, in a reasonable manner, the price of gas.‚Äù\n\nSo far Norway isn't biting. Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St√∏re has repeatedly said he would not back a price cap on gas exports.\n\nHansson is also finding it difficult to get much traction for his idea in the Norwegian parliament, where his party, which only holds three of 169 seats, has met resistance from both the government and other opposition parties.\n\nCommission President Ursula Von der Leyen said she was discussing a ‚Äútask force‚Äù with Norway to look at ‚Äúhow are we able to lower, in a reasonable manner, the price of gas.‚Äù | Monasse/Getty Images\n\nBut in other corners of Europe his argument is beginning to resonate.\n\nNorway should share the ‚Äúgigantic‚Äù profits it has made as a result of higher oil and gas prices, especially with Ukraine, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said earlier this year.\n\nTeresa Ribera, Spain‚Äôs minister for ecological transition, recently called the prices being paid to Norway for gas ‚Äúdisturbing.‚Äù\n\nIn written comments to POLITICO, Norwegian Foreign Minister Anniken Huitfeldt said Europe is facing a supply crisis, and Norway‚Äôs primary duty is to pump more gas.\n\n‚ÄúNorway has been asked by the EU and our European partners to step up its production to cover as much of the shortfall from Russia as we can and we have done our utmost to do so,‚Äù Huidfeldt said.\n\nShe said Russia has deliberately distorted gas prices by shutting off supplies to Europe and was seeking to harm European consumers as part of its war against Ukraine. Norway and its European customers have a shared interest in ‚Äúnormalizing the prices and ending the distortion of the energy market,‚Äù she said.\n\nHuidfeldt said there were ‚Äúmany suggestions under discussion‚Äù but declined to say what those ideas were or which she favored.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm hesitant to go into specific proposals at this time,‚Äù Huidfeldt said. ‚ÄúOne should carefully evaluate the implications of different measures so that the result is not a reduction of supply or less focus on energy savings.‚Äù\n\nMerry Norwegians\n\nSo far neither the cash influx nor the increase in gas prices seems to be worrying many Norwegians.\n\nThe government will allocate about ‚Ç¨1 billion for a scheme that pays 90 percent of household electricity bills when wholesale prices rise above prescribed levels.\n\nMeanwhile, the wider economic outlook also appears comparatively benign, with unemployment around 3 percent and house prices still ticking up despite higher interest rates.\n\nOn the streets of Oslo, war and Europe‚Äôs energy crisis seem a long way away.\n\nLast week, near the city‚Äôs new ‚Ç¨225 million museum housing the works of Edvard Munch, bathers enjoyed the last of the summer heat on an artificial beach.\n\nIn a nearby park close to parliament, Penny Heymans, a 76-year-old pensioner, handed out anti-war leaflets for a group called Grandmothers for Peace.\n\nShe said she was struggling to get much attention from passersby and she noted that Norwegians seemed happy to accept the gas price windfall and not question the deteriorating regional security picture behind it.\n\n‚ÄúPeople are not really that engaged in what‚Äôs going on,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey feel like they are doing fine so why bother rocking the boat.‚Äù\n\nHansson, for one, is bothered that Norwegians seem unwilling to question their own good fortune.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably not good for people to be too rich,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey start to think they have a God-given right to stay that way.‚Äù",

    "Norway maintains presence in Arkhangelsk": "Arkhangelsk was for years a stronghold in Norwegian-Russian cooperation. Home to Russia‚Äôs Arctic University, research institutions, cultural stakeholders, NGOs and regional institutions, the city with over 300,000 inhabitants played a key role in the regional cooperation with its Nordic neighbors.\n\nThat was before the pandemic. And before nearly all cross-border initiatives were canceled or put on hold after Russia launched its war of aggression on Ukraine and against international peace on February 24th.\n\nAndrey Shalyov, Honorary Consul for Norway, says his office gets quite many phone calls and is frequently visited by people previously involved in cross-border activities.\n\n‚ÄúCross-border cooperation was a big resource for many people in Arkhangelsk, it offered great possibilities for their professional and personal development,‚Äù Andrey Shalyov says.\n\nA decade ago, the local airliner flying out of Arkhangelsk was the only one in northern Russia with a dedicated international route. The plane flew via Murmansk to Troms√∏ in northern Norway twice a week and shortened the travel distance for people on both sides of the border engaged in cross-border cooperation.\n\n‚ÄúThe area of activity is of course not that big as it was before,‚Äù Shalyov notes today.\n\n‚ÄúOur relations with local or regional authorities are almost on zero,‚Äù the Honorary Consul explains.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n‚ÄúWe keep a sporadic dialogue with the international department of the regional administration, the international sector of the city administration, the regional office of the foreign ministry, the universities and so on,‚Äù Shalyov elaborates.\n\nA short month after Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine, university rector Elena Kudryashova went public with her support for the war.\n\nMany of her previous project partners in Norway were shocked by Kudryashova‚Äôs statement that ‚Äúliberation Ukraine from nationalist dirt is our historical duty.‚Äù\n\nAndrey Shalyov says he has an impression from the officials he is in contact with that they still have hopes the situation will change for the better.\n\n‚ÄúEverything could change very fast,‚Äù he states with optimism.\n\nIn the non-governmental sector, hopes are fewer.\n\nBranded as foreign agents, several of the NGOs in the Arkhangelsk region that previously cooperated with Nordic partners have suspended their activities. There is little room for independent civil society in Putin‚Äôs totalitarian thinking.\n\nAndrey Shalyov says many people in Arkhangelsk hope better times will come with renewed cross-border contacts with northern Norway. Photo: Thomas Nilsen\n\nArkhangelsk-Vard√∏\n\nA few Russian-Norwegian projects, however, are still moving ahead.\n\n‚ÄúWe for example continue to develop a course on Norwegian language and culture in cooperation with the regional library. It is a combination of language course and a course of lectures on Norwegian culture, traditions and history.‚Äù\n\nThe Honorary Consul says participants in the course this summer traveled to Vard√∏, a small fishing town on Norway‚Äôs coast to the Barents Sea that in pre-Soviet times was a hub for trade with Russia‚Äôs White Sea region.\n\nThe travel to Vard√∏ was also joined by the creative group Taibola Assemble, the actress of Arkhangelsk Puppet Theater and the members of the Norwegian club from Arkhangelsk.\n\n‚ÄúThe project was supported by the General Consulate of Norway in Murmansk,‚Äù Shalyov informs.\n\nMurmansk was long considered one of Norway‚Äôs most important foreign missions abroad, established in 1993 to help boost businesses and people-to-people contacts across the previously closed borders in northernmost Europe.\n\nToday, 30 years on, the Murmansk Consulate is closed, most official contacts are put on hold, and the political contacts between Oslo and Moscow are as cold as they were during the coldest periods of the Cold War.\n\nAs Norway‚Äôs doors in Murmansk now are closed, Andrey Shalyov says the hope is to get support from the Embassy of Norway in Moscow.\n\n‚ÄúWe have a plan to develop this project in autumn 2022 and spring 2023 with participants from Murmansk and Naryan-Mar in addition to Arkhangelsk.‚Äù\n\nNorway has no plans to shut down its contact point in the centre of Arkhangelsk, the city on the banks of Northern Dvina which was Russia‚Äôs first main seaport and where the first Swedish-Norwegian Consulate was opened in 1815.",

It means there is still deforestation in Indonesia going forward.\"\n\nThe countries had signed a landmark deforestation deal in 2010 with Norway offering Indonesia $1 billion to slash its emissions.\n\nBut Jakarta cancelled it last year saying it didn't see enough of the money, while research showed it only made a small dent in Indonesia's carbon-cutting targets.\n\nCritics of the United Nations-backed REDD+ mechanism under which the deal was struck said it was ineffective and trampled on indigenous communities' rights.\n\nUnder the new agreement Norway will send Jakarta an initial $56 million payment for its deforestation reduction in the year 2016 to 2017, the statement said.\n\nIt will then pay Indonesia for years of reductions that followed after verifying the drops in deforestation, meaning it could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Jakarta.\n\nIndonesia has an ambitious goal to reach a net carbon sink -- storing more carbon than it releases into the atmosphere -- by 2030 but its vast forests are still shrinking.\n\nThe country's tree cover has decreased by 18 percent since 2000, a loss that accounts for 6.5 percent of the global total since then, according to Global Forest Watch, a monitoring programme of the environmental research group World Resources Institute.\n\n¬© 2022 AFP",

    "Autumn Transformation in Southern Norway": "Summer in southern Norway is strikingly beautiful, as seasonal snow and ice melt away and expose the region‚Äôs famous glaciers and fjords. But as summer turns to autumn (‚Äúh√∏st‚Äù in Norwegian), another kind of beauty spreads across the landscape.\n\nThe Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA‚Äôs Terra satellite acquired an image (left) on September 20, 2022. Though the calendar said it was the final day of summer, many of the trees, shrubs, and grasses had turned from green to autumnal brown and gold.\n\nFor comparison, the second image (right) shows the same area on June 29, 2022. In this early-summer view, acquired by MODIS on NASA‚Äôs Aqua satellite, snow was still melting away and vegetation was greening in the summer sunlight.\n\nTrees and shrubs change color when cooler air temperatures and fewer sunlit hours trigger them to slow and stop the production of chlorophyll‚Äîthe molecule that plants use to synthesize food. As the green pigment fades, various yellow and red pigments become visible.\n\nColors change early in Norway‚Äôs northern latitudes, as sunlight wanes faster and cooler air temperatures arrive sooner. Elevation matters too. Cooler temperatures upland generally cause vegetation to change color on the mountains before descending into the valleys.\n\nIn some places, green will linger. Forests of evergreen trees, such as spruce and pine, are common in glacial valleys, especially in eastern Norway. But among these forests there are color-changing deciduous trees mixed in, such as birch, ash, rowan, and aspen.\n\nClear satellite views of Norway are uncommon, as the region is frequently covered by clouds. And views of autumn color here are especially fleeting. Snow is already beginning to cover more of the Scandinavian Mountains compared to late August, and it will eventually blanket most of the region.\n\nNASA Earth Observatory images by Lauren Dauphin, using MODIS data from NASA EOSDIS LANCE and GIBS/Worldview.

He also commended the measures taken to mitigate the risks of exploitation of refugees from Ukraine and urged continued attention as the war persists.\n\nThe Special Representative conducts multiple country visits each year to help increase the capacity of OSCE participating States to address human trafficking, share recommendations for further action, and collect best practices for fighting this heinous crime. A report detailing the findings of his visit will be released during the first quarter of 2023."
