    "Best road trips in Greece": "Greece is meant for exploring, and not just by ferry. With your vehicle – rented or otherwise – there is a wealth of history, culture and, yes, beaches to savor.\n\nAway from relying solely on buses and boats, opportunities to leave crowds behind are myriad. Here are five of our favorite road trips in Greece that traverse the fabric of the country’s mainland and islands.\n\nGet local insight on destinations all over the world with our weekly newsletter delivered to your inbox.\n\nWander through the small fishing villages around the short loop on Serifos © Cavan Images / Getty Images\n\nGreek islands road trip\n\nBest road trip for beaches\n\nAthens–Paros; 180km (112 miles) total driving, not including sea travel\n\nAlthough you may think of exploring Greek islands as a sea trip, you’ll need wheels to properly explore and enjoy most of these rocky isles. This is particularly true with beaches, where the best – and least crowded – ones may only be reachable by car.\n\nFew parts of Greece are more iconic than the Cyclades, where the islands dotting the Aegean are the stuff of holiday fantasies. Start this trip in Athens, where the port of Piraeus is your gateway to what awaits. Begin on raw and rugged Serifos – less visited than many of its neighbors, it offers the perfect break from the usual hubbub of life. It has one main road that loops around the island, so your only real decision is whether to go clockwise or the reverse. Discover little fishing villages barely touched by tourism and long, sandy beaches in sheltered coves lapped by impossibly azure waters.\n\nJust next door – and within sight of Serifos – Sifnos exemplifies the distinct personalities that each of the Cycladic islands possesses. It’s popular with visitors and has a well-deserved reputation for its food traditions with many high-end and creative tavernas and restaurants. The roads radiate out from the central town of Apollonia. Follow these short and twisty routes down to a variety of seafront villages with well-developed beach scenes.\n\nMake your final stop on the large and varied island of Paros, which rewards drivers with a plethora of beaches, mountain villages and shimmering hillsides of olive trees.\n\nPlanning Tip: Your big decision on this trip is whether to use the same vehicle for the entire trip or to rent a car on each island. If you’re driving your own vehicle, you may appreciate its familiarity as you go from one island to the next. However, while many ferries transport cars, the costs can be high, and available vehicle slots may fill up even as there remains room for passengers. If hiring a car in Greece, it’s better in terms of price and hassle to just hire one separately on each island.\n\nScout new ways to explore the planet's wildest places with our weekly newsletter delivered to your inbox.\n\nThe best way to explore Greece's history and mythology is by car © Matteo Colombo / Getty Images\n\nAncient Greece\n\nBest road trip for the wonders of the classical world\n\nAthens–Ancient Olympia; 590km (367 miles)\n\nMuch of the best of Greece's classic mythology and history is best visited by car. This trip starts in Athens – of course, you must take a moment to visit the Parthenon – and winds around the mainland and the Peloponnese Peninsula, with stops at sites of legend and lore.\n\nIt’s an easy drive northwest to Ancient Delphi, situated on a breathtaking site overlooking the Gulf of Corinth. Here the fabled oracle was the spiritual center of Ancient Greece when it was at its most powerful. Drive south to Nafplio in the Peloponnese, where you can split your time between a trifecta of sights: the acropolis at Tiryns, the citadel of Ancient Mycenae and the 2500-year-old theater at Epidavros.\n\nFinally, see where modern athletic competitions trace back their roots at Ancient Olympia. Walk amidst the reconstructed stadium that hosted the first Olympic games in 776 BCE and was the site of competitions for an extraordinary 1000 years.\n\nAround Athens\n\nBest road trip for a quick visit\n\nAthens–Marathon; 136km (85 miles)\n\nVisitors to Greece are usually in a hurry to head out from Athens to the islands – and with good reason. But if you’re on a short visit or just looking for a change of pace from the capital, Attica – the water-surrounded region with Athens at its center – will reward visitors who would like to sample excellent beaches, ancient monuments and expanses of natural beauty.\n\nSome 17km (10.5 miles) southeast of Athens, Glyfada is a tiny suburb that marks the start of the so-called Apollo Coast (or Athenian Riviera, depending on whose marketing material you favor). Small beaches backed by upscale clubs and more isolated strands on coves favored by nudists dot the coast. Pause for a cultural moment at the gleaming marble Temple of Poseidon at Cape Sounion.\n\nFollowing the craggy shore northeast, finish your drive at Marathon – yes, that Marathon – where Pheidippides began his run to Athens with news of military victory. Today, it’s a comfortable and beachy suburb, where the greatest challenge you’ll face is choosing between its many seafront tavernas.\n\nPause your Crete road trip to enjoy one of the island's numerous uncrowded beaches © SolStock / Getty Images\n\nThe magnificent island of Crete\n\nBest road trip for exploring a Mediterranean highlight\n\nIraklio–Hania; 280km (174 miles)\n\nGeographically very much separate from the rest of Greece but culturally a core part of the nation, Crete is unmissable. The Mediterranean’s fifth largest island (right after Corsica) is a panoply of historical sights, areas of superb natural beauty, hidden and uncrowded beaches and soaring peaks that seem almost Alpine in their grandeur.\n\nStart in the eastern city of Iraklio and go immediately south to the ancient Minoan Palace of Knossos. Get lost within this sprawling complex where the links to the past are tangible. Drive west to the holy site of Moni Arkadiou, a 16th-century monastery that embodies the indomitable Cretan spirit. Here you can understand how invaders from the Romans to the Turks to the Nazis, with dozens more in between, found their dreams of conquest shattered by the island’s fiercely independent spirit.\n\nDrive through the sheer cliffs, high mountain passes and deep gorges down to the south coast, where the beach town of Sougia remains untouched by mass tourism. Get a ferry or take a hike to ancient sites and even more remote beaches.\n\nFinally, head north to Hania, the evocative port town that oozes history within its Venetian-era walls.\n\nPlanning Tip: Distances on Crete can be deceiving. That seemingly short 60km (37-mile) jaunt from the touristy north to the untrammeled south will take much longer than you might expect. Roads curve sharply through the deeply eroded landscape, and the going can be very slow. And don’t expect many roadside signs to offer guidance; Cretans have yet to see a sign they didn’t shoot full of holes, a local source of pride and spirit.\n\nA drive into the Zagorohoria region will lead you to traditional villages tucked away in pristine mountains © Posnov / Getty Images\n\nNorthern wilds\n\nBest road trip to get off the beaten path\n\nThessaloniki–Sithonia; 880km (547 miles)\n\nGreece’s second city, Thessaloniki, is a wonderfully under-visited center for history, art, great food and intoxicating nightlife. Start here exploring the nation’s north, which borders a diverse range of neighboring countries and bears the influences of Macedonians, Romans, Byzantines, Slavs, Turks, and many more.\n\nDrive southwest to the fabled peak of Mt Olympus, Greece’s highest. A spiritual heart of the nation, you can drive up to its loftier elevations and go for hikes, both easy and world-class.\n\nStay in the mountains as you go west into the Zagorohoria region, which is dotted by tiny villages that have carried on across the millennia. Circle back towards Thessaloniki and finish your road trip at the unheralded but unmissable beaches of the Halkidiki Peninsula. Plunge deep into the very southeastern tip of remote Sithonia.\n\nTips for driving in Greece\n\nAlthough Greece follows EU conventions for driving regulations, there are some valuable things to remember as you drive around.",
    "2nd camp harboring terrorists in Greece opened next to Lavrion: Sources": "A second camp that is harboring terrorists was opened in Greece next to the existing notorious Lavrion camp, sources said amid increasing tensions between Ankara and Athens.\n\nA Turkish official told Daily Sabah that although Athens rejected claims that Lavrion has become a breeding ground for terrorists, Ankara has discovered another camp similar to Lavrion had been opened. “We are in a very fragile process,” the official said regarding bilateral ties.\n\nGreece has long been accused of being a favorite hideout for terrorists from the DHKP-C and PKK. Those fleeing Türkiye have taken shelter in refugee camps in Lavrion near Athens under the guise of being asylum-seekers, especially in the 1980s. Despite the closure of Lavrion in 2013 amid pressure from Türkiye, Greece continues to be the primary destination for DHKP-C terrorists.\n\nFootage from the camp shows that it has turned into a base for PKK terrorists.\n\nThe camp seen resembles a terrorist base, with terrorist symbols and pictures of its imprisoned ringleader Abdullah Öcalan adorning its walls.\n\nFurthermore, a diplomatic official had told Daily Sabah previously that “there is everything ranging from the DHKP-C, the PKK and FETÖ (Gülenist Terror Group) and the location of all of them is known.”\n\nThe aim is that these groups could be used one day against Türkiye, the official said. “An EU member country in the 21st century is openly feeding terrorists. The PKK is a terrorist group and designated as such by both the EU and the U.S,” explained the official.\n\n“Athens is not a transit country for terrorists anymore, but the direct target country.”\n\nAthens has also rejected Ankara’s extradition requests for terrorists from groups advocating armed insurgency against the state and had been involved in armed attacks against Turkish security forces and political parties, in addition to other targets.\n\nRejected extradition requests include members of the outlawed terrorist group The Revolutionary Left (Dev-Sol), members of the DHKP-C, the Turkish (or Kurdish) Hezbollah, the illegal Marxist-Leninist Communist Party (MLKP), the THKP-C, the PKK, the illegal Communist Party of Türkiye/Marxist-Leninist (TKP-ML) and from other groups.\n\nMost recently, Turkish police detained a PKK terrorist who received training at the notorious camp in Greece and had been planning to carry out armed and bomb attacks in large cities, Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu had announced.\n\nThe terrorist, identified as Hüsamettin Tanrıkulu, code-named “Delil,” was detained in a joint counterterrorism operation by Istanbul and Diyarbakır police.\n\nHe had entered Türkiye through illegal means after receiving sabotage training at the Lavrion camp in Greece.\n\nAthens permitting the existence of another camp harboring terrorists within its borders comes as relations between Türkiye and Greece hit a new low in recent months.\n\nTürkiye and Greece are at odds over a number of issues, including competing claims over jurisdiction in the Eastern Mediterranean, overlapping claims over their continental shelves, maritime boundaries, air space, energy, the ethnically split island of Cyprus, the status of the islands in the Aegean Sea and migrants.\n\nAnkara accuses Athens of illegally militarizing Greek islands in the East Aegean and questions Greece's sovereignty over them. There is also a dispute over the exploitation of mineral resources in the Aegean.\n\nAmong the most recent developments that flared tensions was the harassment by two Greek coast guard boats of a cargo ship in international waters, continued pushbacks by Greek elements recorded by Turkish unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as well as the harassment of Turkish fighter jets under a NATO mission by Greece’s Russian-made S-300s.\n\nIt was reported recently that Turkish jets on a reconnaissance mission, flying in international airspace, had been harassed by the Greek defense system stationed on Crete. Athens rejects the claims.\n\nTürkiye is planning to submit to NATO and its allies the radar logs showing how a Greek S-300 air defense system locked on to Turkish F-16 jets during a mission in international airspace, sources said last week. Türkiye has also lodged a protest and demanded an explanation and investigation from Greece into an incident that was \"totally in violation of international laws,\" according to Turkish diplomatic sources.\n\nMeanwhile, the Greek government wrote letters to NATO, the European Union and the United Nations, asking them to formally condemn what they claim is \"increasingly aggressive talk\" by Turkish officials in response to the continued Greek violations, and suggesting that tensions could escalate into open conflict.",
    "Turkey 'challenges' Greece to enter talks on Aegean dispute": "The remarks, made by Turkish officials at the UN General Assembly, came in response to a speech by Greek prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis at the UN.\n\nTurkey has called on Greece to enter talks on various disputes relating to the Aegean Sea, Anadolu reported on Sunday.\n\nThe remarks, made by Turkish officials at the UN General Assembly, came in response to a speech by Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis at the UN, in which he accused Turkey of \"playing [a] destabilising role in the Eastern Mediterranean, the Middle East, and the Caucasus.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, this statement was yet another example of distortion of facts and hostile narrative against Türkiye. Türkiye's role in its region and beyond is well appreciated by the international community,\" the Turkish delegation said.\n\n\"However, Türkiye does challenge Greece to enter into an honest and meaningful dialogue in accordance with international law to address not one but all legally interrelated Aegean disputes,\" they added, while also slamming allegations that Turkey has threatened Greece's territorial sovereignty.\n\nRELATED Turkey says video proves Greece's migrant pushback World\n\nThe two uneasy NATO neighbours have long feuded over maritime borders and energy exploration rights in disputed parts of the Aegean and eastern Mediterranean.\n\nAccording to Athens, Ankara began \"illegal\" oil exploration in the northern Aegean back in 1973.\n\nThe Turkish UN delegation also urged Greece to stop its migrant pushbacks in the Aegean Sea.\n\nThe two countries' war of words has escalated in recent months, with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly attacking Greece over the islands and saying he will no longer meet Greek leaders.",
    "Greece: Anti-racism commission praises Greece’s national action plans, but concerns remain": "European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) Strasbourg\n\nThe European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) has welcomed Greece’s anti-racism action plan, developments in LGBTI equality, changes to the migration code to help third party nationals and moves by national broadcasters to stop hate speech.\n\nBut concerns remain, say ECRI in their latest country report. These include limits to the Greek ombudsmen’s ability to represent victims in court, continued discrimination to LGBTI pupils in schools, the frequent use of hate speech in public life and restrictions to how NGOs can assist migrants. It also points to serious misgivings about low housing standards and forced evictions of Roma and allegations of racist and LGBTI-phobic police abuse\n\nPress release\n\nGreece: Anti-racism commission praises adoption of national action plans, but raises concerns about inequalities and racism in policing",
    "Greece: Pushbacks by Sea and Land, Türkiye an Increasingly ‘Unsafe Third Country’": "Brutal pushbacks continue off the Aegean islands and in the Evros region. The situation for Syrian refugees in Türkiye deemed safe by Greek authorities is rapidly deteriorating.\n\nReports of non-response and pushbacks by Greek authorities by sea and land continue. According to Aegean Boat Report, the Greek authorities and Hellenic Coast Guard remained unresponsive to alerts of 49 people in distress off Samos on a rubber boat taking in water. On the same day, the organisation warned of 44 Palestinians “in imminent danger of being pushed back by Greek authorities” after arriving on the island of Agathonisi. The NGO hotline Alarm Phone has published detailed testimonies from a group of 29 people pushed back by Greek authorities in August after being pulled to Rhodes and pushed towards Turkish waters. A survivor describes the brutal incident where Greek officials: “took our phones, beat us up heavily and took our personal belongings. (I could hide my phone, so one phone was left with our whole group). Then, the Hellenic Coast Guard took 2 people of us (both Syrian nationals) and beat them up very hard and kept them there. Since then we don’t know anything about the 2 people – we have no contact to them anymore”. A young Turkish man went missing on 8 September while crossing the Evros river separating Greece and Türkiye. After arriving safely in Greece, he was detained along with other people seeking protection, loaded onto the same rubber boat they had arrived on where the young man lost his balance and disappeared in the water. On 11 September, Alarm Phone reported of: “a group of around 80 asylum seekers in prison in Greece, close to Evros. Several of them are in severe medical conditions and are being held in squalid conditions!”. The organisation later confirmed that the group had been held at Isaakio border guard station along with hundreds of other people and had been pushed back to Turkey. While the Greek government denies pushbacks it has reported “averting” 150,000 irregular arrivals in 2022. As of 11 September, 10,139 people had arrived in Greece in 2022 – 5,742 by sea and 4,397 by land.\n\nGreece deems Türkiye a safe third country for people originating from the main refugee-producing countries including Syria, allowing authorities to refuse asylum claims as inadmissible. However, the already difficult situation for the more than 3,6 million Syrian refugees in Türkiye is rapidly deteriorating. According to Le Monde, a crackdown is intensifying and raising mounting concern among Syrian refugees who are “facing increasing administrative difficulties as the government enforces tougher measures”. This development is taking place in the context of an emerging economic crisis in Türkiye and increasingly more extreme rhetoric from nationalist politicians. Sadly, such rhetoric resonates with the population and reportedly 82 per cent of the population demands Syrians to return home. According to Der Spiegel, President Erdogan has turned on Syrian refugees and hundreds of thousands of people are arrested and deported at gunpoint by Turkish authorities. Turkish media reports that 25,000 Syrians left Türkiye for the EU over recent months due to rising anti-refugee sentiments – 10,000 through resettlement and 15,000 Syrians who travelled through other means. “Many of the people around me are preparing to leave again, to go to Europe,” said Zaynab from Idlib (northwestern Syria), adding: “To some extent, we’re reliving the experience of 2015”. Reportedly, a group of Syrian refugees are planning a caravan to the EU via an online channel followed by almost 70,000 people with organizers calling on people to bring sleeping bags, tents, life jackets, water, canned food and first aid kits. The number of migrants and refugees who cross from Türkiye into Bulgaria has increased substantially. Border authorities have recorded 85,000 arrivals over the first eight months of 2022 which is more than double the number for the whole of 2021.\n\nFor further information:\n\nThis article appeared in the ECRE Weekly Bulletin.

    "Türkiye commemorates victims of Greece's Tripolitsa massacre": "The Turkish president on Friday marked the anniversary of the Tripolitsa massacre committed by the Greeks during the Greek revolt that started in the Peloponnese in 1821, the year Greece separated from the Ottoman Empire.\n\nIn a Twitter post, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said Türkiye has not forgotten and will never forget the Tripolice Massacre, which took place on Sept. 23, 1821, \"in which thousands of Muslim Turks, our Albanian brothers and Jews were brutally and barbarically murdered.\"\n\nOn Sept. 23, 1821, tens of thousands of Muslims and Jews were massacred by the Greeks in Tripolitsa, a strategic city in the southern Peloponnese region of today’s Greece.\n\nTurks in Peloponnese faced not only death but also starvation and captivity. The Ottoman Jews living in the region also faced Greek atrocities and lost their lives due to famine, misery and plunder.\n\nTürkiye still criticizes Greece for its unwelcoming stance toward its Muslim population. For instance, up until recently, Athens was known as the only European capital without a mosque, even though there are an estimated 300,000 Muslims in the greater Athens area. Back in November 2020, for the first time since the 19th century, Athens witnessed the inauguration of an official mosque, as years of efforts by the Muslim community finally paid off.\n\nGreece was under the rule of the Ottoman Empire for centuries, until 1829 when the Greek population succeeded in gaining independence from the empire. At the time, there were many mosques and other Ottoman architecture all over Greece. However, the riots and independence triggered a wave during which all such architecture was damaged or removed, eventually leaving Athens without any mosque. In fact, Athens' lack of mosques is a norm for the majority of the Greek cities as the only officially sanctioned mosques in the country are in the northern border region with Turkey where up to 150,000 members of the Turkish minority live.\n\nTürkiye has long decried Greek violations of the rights of its Muslim and Turkish minority, from closing down mosques and letting historic mosques fall into disrepair, to refusing to recognize Muslims' election of their own muftis. These measures violate the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne as well as the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) verdicts, making Greece a state that flouts the law, Turkish officials say.\n\nSimilarly, the election of muftis, or Islamic clerics, by Muslims in Greece has become yet another point of contention that caused trouble for the Muslims in the country. Even though it is regulated by the 1913 Treaty of Athens, a Greek-Ottoman Empire pact that was implemented by Athens in 1920, that the community will be able to elect their own muftis, in 1991, in violation of international law, Greece annulled the treaty and unlawfully started to appoint the muftis itself. The muftis appointed by the Greek state have since usurped local Muslims' right of jurisdiction on family and inheritance matters. The majority of Muslim Turks in Western Thrace do not recognize muftis appointed by the Greek state and instead elect their own.",

    "Greece vs Northern Ireland tips: Relegation looming large for Ian Baraclough's men": "As things stand, Cyprus occupy the bottom spot in the group - though with Northern Ireland sitting above them on goal difference, things could easily change on Tuesday night.\n\nTo make matters worse for the Irish, they face an away clash against Greece - a side which has won four of their five group games and sit top with an enormous six-point advantage.\n\nCyprus, on the other hand, will travel to Kosovo in high spirits after handing the Greeks their first defeat last Saturday.\n\nHowever, it's not all bad news for Northern Ireland.\n\nLast time out, Ian Baraclough's men scored two goals in the final eight minutes of their game against Kosovo to seal a 2-1 win.\n\nNot only did that show a lot of guts, but it also proved that the Irish are capable of finding the back of the net.\n\nScoring goals will be important against Greece, though not as important as scoring first.\n\nOut of the last 11 games featuring the Greek national side, ten of those were won to nil. With that in mind, whoever opens the scoring in Athens will give themselves a major helping hand.\n\nNevertheless, overcoming Greece away from home is a task that cannot be underestimated.\n\nGus Poyet's side have lost just one of their last 14 games at home, with that sole defeat coming against Spain.\n\nSince 2019 only three nations have managed to pull off victories in Athens. Understandably, Northern Ireland are priced as major underdogs as they look to become the fourth.\n\nBaraclough's side have won just one of their last six games, and have endured three defeats during that run - all by a margin of one goal.\n\nWith that in mind, our recommendation is to back Greece to pick up their fifth Nations League victory.\n\nNorthern Ireland are expected to put on a good fight, though a lack of quality in their squad is likely to be their downfall in Athens.\n\nWith regards to goals, a low-scoring game should be on the cards considering both sides have scored a combined 13 times in the Nations League this season.\n\nWhat's more, Greece boast a fierce defensive record having conceded just one goal from their last five games.\n\nKey stats\n\n- Northern Ireland have won just one of their last six games\n\n- Northern Ireland are winless in their last four competitive away games\n\n- Ten of the 11 games featuring Greece have been won by a single goal\n\n- Northern Ireland have won two of their last three encounters with Greece\n\n- Greece have conceded just one goal in the Nations League this season\n\nSuggested bets\n\n- F/T Result - Greece to win\n\n- Greece to win by a one goal margin\n\n- Correct score - Greece to win 1-0\n\n- Under 2.5 goals\n\n- Under 10.5 corners",

It needs to be looked at.\n\n\"Clearly it's an historic video from social media from when he was 16 I think. I'm not sure where it's going to go at this time.\n\n\"You just hope that it isn't (something that continues) and things don't get churned up. I'd rather leave it at that and not elaborate on it too much. I was trying to concentrate on a game of football and that's what we did.\n\n\"It's been tough for the boys because if you lose two members of the squad, you know they get close and they don't like to see that happen to anyone. It could have played a major factor but they rallied and got a result.\"",

Return ferry tickets to an island last year for a family of four, including a car, cost around 600 euros.\n\nThis year, it’s over 850 euros, according to the Greek Ministry of Shipping and Island Policy. The cheapest hotel on the Greek island of Mykonos this week costs at least 200 euros per night. That’s prohibitive even for most middle class Greeks. In total, a family holiday to a modest island destination would cost someone earning double the minimum wage a full month’s salary. And that’s before accounting for food, drinks, and restaurant costs.\n\nPort officials direct traffic from a ferry in Piraeus, Greece.\n\nGraffiti is seen in central Athens.\n\n\n\nYet Athenians’ biggest complaint of all is the rise in rent.\n\n“We in Greece had the big financial problems of 2010 to 2016. We recovered. Everything went well, and then came COVID, and then the war,” said Giorgios Stampoulos, an Athens cab driver for over 22 years. “Now, the tourists came back. We have a lot of tourists. … But the problem is we can’t afford an apartment because it’s all Airbnb for tourists, and if you find something, they want double or triple from last year.”\n\nBefore the pandemic, a modest two-bedroom apartment in central Athens would rent for roughly 300 euros a month. Now, the monthly price is at least 550 euros. Prices in large part have soared as tourists, expatriates, and digital nomads are making the most of the capital’s comparatively low rents and living costs. “If you have a Western European salary, Athens is a good base,” said 27-year-old Ben Biasi, a French tourist strolling through the pedestrian backstreets of Athens’s Plaka neighborhood.\n\nGiorigios Stampoulos waits for tourists arriving at Athens International Airport.\n\nTaxis and buses wait outside Athens International Airport.\n\n“Let’s go to an island, buy a house, and work from the house!” he said to his group of friends.\n\nCompanies like Airbnb and Booking.com have been catering to not only tourists but those seeking longer-term stays. One such company is Blueground, which has more than 1,000 fully furnished apartments in Athens, rented out to mostly U.S. citizens for around 1,200 euros per month.\n\n“Business is a booming! It’s good,” said Demetri Geras, 27, from Blueground. “They come for the sun. It’s the Florida of Europe.”\n\nA family holiday to a modest island destination would cost someone earning double the minimum wage a full month’s salary.\n\nAs a Greek-American with family here, however, Geras recognizes the hardships that Greeks are facing. “Most of the youth here are living with their parents. They make less than 1,000 euros a month, so they can’t move out.” Although he works in property, Geras sees the problem as a lack of fair employment opportunity and remuneration from employers.\n\n“We can point fingers at people in real estate, but it’s almost criminal how much [Greeks] get paid,” he said. “They are almost starving. … Wages are not so great due to austerity measures and low Greek minimum wage. Food and rent have gone up. Homeowners have raised their Airbnb prices for foreigners who are coming to Athens. And Greeks are the ones paying the price.”\n\nA street vendor sits in central Athens.\n\nOne of those people paying the price is street artist and graphic designer Kostas Sergiou, 36. “I’m struggling,” he said. “In March, I had a health problem, a panic attack. … The cause was stress.” Sergiou’s landlady put up his rent, and now, he’s struggling to find the money to pay his bills.\n\nSummer holidays are sacred to Greeks, and most Athenians tend to flee the city heat for vacations on the coast or mountains. Sergiou is staying put. “I prefer to stay here because I feel less stressed. … For us Greeks, it’s cheaper to go on a trip outside Greece than to an island.”\n\nTourists pose for a selfie in Monastiraki Square in Athens.\n\nTourists walk through the Monastiraki Flea Market in Athens.\n\n\n\nDespite the economic hardships, Greeks are still finding ways to have a break. Drive along the coast from Athens to the ancient Temple of Poseidon, known as Sounio, this summer, and you will find lines of parked cars dotted around rocky swimming holes. The so-called Athenian Riviera is packed.\n\nAs city residents seek swims closer to home, Greeks also continue to have a relatively high level of property ownership within their families, and many Greeks are choosing to take breaks at their family homes or with friends who own property. Others are finding cheaper alternatives like “free camping,” playing a cat-and-mouse game with authorities as they erect tents along the coast before being told to move on or saturating areas where it is tolerated, such as the far-flung Greek island of Tilos, which has seen a spike in campers this year.\n\nOthers, still, are going abroad to European destinations like Berlin, Sergiou said, as Greece becomes unaffordable.\n\nBut amid it all, a trace of traditional Greek attitudes remains. “Open your Instagram, and you see everyone splashing about. … Summer is summer,” Sergiou said. “Greek people will go wherever they can and face their problems in September.”",
    "Group of countries – Greece among them – to push EU for gas price cap": "The European Commission cannot be blamed for keeping Greece in check after it spent money it could ill-afford on handouts. [Reuters]\n\nA group of European Union countries want to push Brussels to produce plans this week for a bloc-wide cap on the price of gas, according to a draft letter seen by Reuters.\n\nThe EU proposed a package of emergency measures to tackle soaring energy prices earlier this month, but has steered clear of a gas price cap, an idea which has split the bloc’s 27 member states.\n\nCountries in favour plan to step up pressure on Brussels, with a letter asking the European Commission to make proposals on a gas price cap for discussion at a meeting of EU energy ministers on Friday, followed by a legislative proposal as soon as possible.\n\n“We acknowledge the efforts made by the Commission and the measures it has put forward to face the crisis. But we have yet to tackle the most serious problem of all: the wholesale price of natural gas,” said a draft of the letter, seen by Reuters.\n\nEU officials said around 10 countries are considering signing the letter, with Belgium, Italy, Poland, Malta and Greece among them.\n\nAddressed to EU energy commissioner Kadri Simson, the draft letter called for a price cap on all wholesale gas transactions. Diplomats were negotiating over the letter on Monday, and its contents could still change.\n\nThe draft said capping gas prices would help countries rein “untenable inflationary pressures” hitting households and businesses, and could be designed in a way that ensures security of supply.\n\nOther states oppose capping gas prices, raising doubts as to whether any EU proposal would win sufficient support.\n\nGermany, the Netherlands and Denmark say capping prices could endanger the security of supply by undermining the EU’s ability to attract gas deliveries this winter.\n\nRussia has slashed gas deliveries to Europe since the West imposed sanction on Moscow invaded Ukraine, leaving countries scrambling to secure alternative supplies.\n\nSo far, the European Commission has proposed emergency EU measures including windfall profit levies on energy firms, and cuts in electricity use.\n\nEU countries are negotiating those proposals and aim to approve them when EU energy ministers meet on Friday.\n\nMeanwhile, other EU proposals are in the works – including liquidity support for energy firms, and extra measures to bring down gas prices.\n\nThe Commission had been expected to publish an update this week on the new measures it is exploring, but EU officials said on Monday this was now expected in early October.

    "Is Greece failing to deploy EU-funded surveillance system at Turkish border as intended?": "On August 15, 2022, a group of 38 Syrian and Palestinian men, women and children were picked up by Greek authorities in the Evros region on the Greek-Turkish border and taken to a nearby refugee center for processing. Their rescue marked the end of an internationally-reported, weekslong ordeal during which the asylum-seekers said they had been stranded on a small, unnamed islet in the Evros River — the natural border between Greece and Turkey.\n\nThe islet, which is located near the Greek village of Kissari, is in a restricted military zone that is inaccessible to civilians. While stranded, some of the asylum-seekers were in contact with civil society groups and journalists, sending their GPS coordinates and pleas for help.\n\nFor weeks, those attempting to help from afar provided the Greek police with GPS coordinates, which were confirmed by live locations and metadata in photos and other material the asylum-seekers had sent. Greek authoritiesreleased media statements saying that they had made \"successive investigations, with every suitable technical means,\" but had been unable to locate the group.\n\nGreek and international media outlets reported that a young Syrian girl traveling with the group died while awaiting rescue. Officials from the center-right administration of Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis have questioned the story of the young girl's death and maintained that Greece responded to the incident in accordance with EU and international law.\n\nCould the asylum-seekers have been rescued sooner?\n\nLess than two kilometers (about a mile) away from the group's shared location, on a hill overlooking sunflower and wheat fields and the road that runs parallel to the islet, stands a surveillance pylon equipped with radar, heat sensors and cameras. This tech-laden pylon is believed to be part of the newly-expanded surveillance system that Greek police could have used to locate the asylum-seekers on the islet.\n\nIn recent years, Greece has poured millions into high-tech systems — including drones, sensors and cameras — aimed at tracking down and deterring migrants attempting to enter the country irregularly. Although parts of the Automated Border Surveillance System (ABSS) have existed for years, Greek authorities, with funding from the EU, recently undertook a €15 million project (just under $15 million) to expand the system in the Evros border region.\n\nAn investigation by DW, in cooperation with independent researchers who exclusively shared material and findings with DW, strongly suggests that a prompt rescue of the group could have been possible with Greece's newly-expanded state-of-the-art surveillance system. This would contradict police statements on this and similar search-and-rescue missions in the region.\n\nDid Greek authorities know where the asylum-seekers were?\n\n\"It's absurd that the Greek police and government in this incident, and similar ones earlier this year, say that they cannot locate people on islets. They have the technology, and the area is heavily patrolled by both police and army,\" said Lena Karamanidou, an Evros native with an in-depth knowledge of the region and an expert in asylum policies, who spent months mapping the previously undisclosed locations of the pylons that make up the ABSS.\n\nKaramanidou — formerly affiliated with Glasgow Caledonian University in Scotland and currently an independent researcher — has contributed to several major journalistic investigations and reports on alleged human rights abuses in Evros.\n\nMigrants protesting near the Greek parliament against alleged pushbacks and border violence. Greece has repeatedly and strongly denied that its forces are involved in pushbacks\n\nAs part of the mapping effort, Karamanidou reviewed historical satellite imagery together with Phevos Simeonidis, an independent researcher whose work often features in media reports, and Laszlo Kovacs, who works with border monitor groups on a voluntary basis. Karamanidou verified the existence of the pylons during field research in the region, using images of pylons publicized in the Greek media as a reference.\n\nSurveillance pylons close to the islet where asylum-seekers were stranded\n\nDW confirmed the location of several pylons when reporting from the region in April and July of this year. DW also analyzed historical satellite imagery, reviewed dozens of Greek and EU records — some obtained through public records requests — and conducted on-the-ground field work over several months in Evros as part of the investigation.\n\nA measurement — which factors-in elevation levels — of the distance between one of the identified pylons and the islet in question, paired with an analysis of publicly-available technical specifications contained in police documents, suggests that the system should have been able to detect the refugees and ensure their prompt rescue.\n\nThe islet on the River Evros on the Greek-Turkish border where a group of 38 asylum-seekers said they were stranded is located in a restricted military zone\n\nDW contacted Space Hellas S.A., the Greek private company contracted to expand the ABSS, to ask whether the system delivered to Greek police matches technical descriptions in police documents and in Greek media reports. The company declined to comment, citing confidentiality.\n\nThe total 'sealing of the Evros border'\n\nCovering what they described as the ABSS's completion with much fanfare last fall, Greek media noted that it marked the total \"sealing of the Evros border.\" The all-seeing system, they proclaimed, can even spot activity several kilometers into Turkish territory, a capability also described in technical police documents.\n\nThe Greek Police were repeatedly contacted by DW and invited to comment on the findings of the investigation over the course of more than two weeks. A police spokesperson pointed DW to press releases, which did not specifically address the questions asked.\n\nRound-the-clock surveillance\n\nThe revamped system, according to Greek police documents, gives Greek authorities the ability to stay \"informed in real time\" and \"with great accuracy\" on the \"conditions in the field for the entire length of our country's river border with Turkey.\"\n\nGreece has built a steel wall along the Evros river, the natural border between Turkey and Greece, to prevent migrants from entering the country irregularly\n\nData from the pylons, including video streams and radar tracks, are fed to local and regional monitoring centers, which are staffed to survey the footage round the clock. Information is ultimately fed to the National Coordination Center in Athens that is part of the European Border Surveillance Network (EUROSUR), an EU project aimed at facilitating information-sharing between border management authorities and Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency.\n\nThe stated aim of the surveillance infrastructure of which the ABSS is a part, which is laid out in formal documents, is to \"prevent and combat illegal crossings\" into Greece and to ensure \"the protection and saving of migrants' lives.\"\n\nMinister claims no surveillance data on the stranded asylum-seekers\n\nDuring an August 30 meeting in parliament, Civil Protection Minister Takis Theodorikakos appeared to suggest that the ABSS had been used in the search-and-rescue operation but said that there was \"no data on the electronic surveillance system that people were [on the islet].\" He provided no further details, and his office did not respond to emails seeking clarification.\n\nCivil Protection Minister Takis Theodorikakos (archive photo) has said that the ABSS was successfully deployed in efforts to stop 36,000 people from entering Greece through the Evros border in August alone\n\nAt the same time, Theodorikakos said, the system had been successfully deployed in multi-pronged deterrence efforts to stop 36,000 people from entering Greece through the Evros border in August alone.\n\nMinistry says Greece fulfilled its humanitarian duty quickly\n\nThe Greek Ministry of Migration and Asylum directed DW's queries on the ABSS to the Greek police. \"It is evident that our country quickly fulfilled its humanitarian duty, offering health care and the possibility of submitting an asylum request to the group of 38 migrants as soon as they entered Greek territory,\" the migration ministry wrote to DW in an e-mail through the government's foreign media office.\n\nFrontex has no access to the ABSS\n\nWhen asked about the search-and-rescue mission and the ABSS system, Frontex wrote in an e-mail to DW: \"We offered our support to Greek authorities but were assured that they had the situation under control.\" Frontex has been rocked by a series of media investigations alleging that the agency was aware of illegal pushbacks by Greek authorities and was even able to monitor some of incidents from its own surveillance systems. Greece has strongly denied allegations that its forces are involved in pushbacks.\n\nLena Karamanidou says that the Greek authorities have the technology to locate people on islets in the River Evros\n\n\"The Automated Border Surveillance System in Evros is operated by Hellenic Police and Frontex has no direct access to it,\" a Frontex spokesperson wrote, adding that the agency would only be deployed to assist authorities based on observations made by the national coordination center in Athens, rather than the local and regional centers in the Evros region.\n\nEU Commission regrets loss of life\n\nDW contacted the European Commission regarding the findings of this investigation.\n\n\"The EU Commission regrets any loss of lives and we recall the fundamental importance of ensuring all measures are taken to prevent such tragedies, as on the Evros river islet,\" an EU Commission Spokesperson for HOME Affairs wrote in response to a request for comment on DW's findings that the ABSS could have been used for a prompt rescue. \"We welcome the efforts carried out by Greek authorities locating 38 people and providing aid while transferring them to a temporary accommodation. We have been in contact with the Greek authorities to stress the importance of taking the necessary measures to find appropriate solutions in the case at stake.\"\n\nMember States must ensure principles are respected\n\n75% of the expansion of the ABSS was financed through the EU's internal security fund.\n\nGreek Minister for Migration and Asylum Notis Mitarachi has accused Turkey of violently forcing asylum-seekers to cross the Greek border and has said Greece will further step up security in the Evros region in response\n\nThe EU spokesperson said that any activity financed by the EU budget must be implemented in full compliance with international law and the EU charter of fundamental rights. \"In cases of identified non-compliance, the EU Commission can reject requests for cost reimbursement declared in relation to the respective activity,\" the spokesperson wrote, adding that it is up to Member States to ensure that principles are respected and to carry out investigations following allegations of non-compliance.\n\nSurveillance in the Evros region\n\n\"The Evros region is one of the most high-risk, unregulated testing grounds for new border technologies. Ranging from sound cannons to aerial surveillance to high-tech fencing, these technologies are sharpening the already violent Greece-Turkey border,\" said Petra Molnar, associate director of the Refugee Law Lab at York University who studies the impact of border technologies on people on the move.\n\nStepping up surveillance and security in the Evros region has risen as a priority for Greece and the EU since the events of March 2020, when thousands of people, many at the encouragement of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, came to the Evros border and attempted to enter Greece to seek asylum.\n\nDuring a visit to Evros in 2020, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen (right, pictured here with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis in 2021) thanked Greece for being \"our European shield\"\n\nGreece accused its neighbor of orchestrating the ordeal to put pressure on the EU. During a visit to Evros at the time, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen thanked Greece for being \"our European shield.\"\n\nPrecarious situation for asylum-seekers\n\nThe case comes at a time of heightened tension between Greece and Turkey and a time when human rights groups and journalists are reporting an increasingly precarious situation for asylum-seekers and refugees in Turkey.\n\nGreece and Turkey accuse each other of political foul play at the expense of asylum-seekers. Human rights organizations and international media have been reporting on systematic pushbacks for years and the fact that asylum-seekers are deprived of their right to apply for asylum in Europe after irregularly crossing the Greek-Turkish border. Greek authorities accuse the Turkish side of violently pushing asylum-seekers towards Greece. The group of asylum-seekers recently stranded on the Evros islet also alleges that it was pushed back and forth between the countries several times.\n\nGreece is obligated to help\n\nThe Greek authorities, after claiming that they were not able to locate the group, later announced that the asylum-seekers were on Turkish territory, and that the corresponding authorities had been informed. While the group was stranded in July, lawyers petitioned the European Court of Human Rights, which issued temporary measures ordering Greek authorities to rescue the people and give them access to the asylum procedure. Greek authorities failed to comply, despite appeals from Greek and international civil society groups.\n\n\"In Evros, a new wave of invasion is already being planned, under a supposedly humanitarian mask,\" Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said during a parliamentary debate in August\n\n\"If the state is aware of a risk to an individual and it can reasonably act to prevent the risk, then it is obligated to do so,\" said Omer Shatz, a lecturer in international law at Science Po Paris and legal director of the NGO Front-LEX. \"Even if the group was on Turkish territory but the Greek authorities watched their situation through cameras [and other technology], they were obliged to take the necessary measures to save the child's life and secure the safety of others.\"\n\nAsylum-seekers claim illegal pushbacks\n\nSince March, the European Court of Human Rights has issued at least 17 interim measures ordering Greek authorities to rescue people in distress in Evros. Greek police have complied with fewer than half. In some of these cases, asylum-seekers allege that they were illegally pushed back to Turkey.\n\nIn recent days, the rescue of the group has unleashed a fresh wave of familiar rhetoric from Greek government officials, who blame Turkey for forcing asylum-seekers onto Greece's doorstep in order to antagonize the country and the European Union.\n\nAthens suggests Turkey behind wave of asylum-seekers\n\n\"In Evros, a new wave of invasion is already being planned, under a supposedly humanitarian mask,\" Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said during a parliamentary debate in August.\n\nAppearing on Greek TV, Greek Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi said Turkey is violently forcing asylum-seekers to the Greek border in the expectation that civil society organizations, journalists and the European Court of Human Rights will intervene to compel Greece to rescue people. This, Mitarachi said, was a new tactic with which Turkey was weaponizing asylum-seekers to create a \"backdoor\" into Europe, and test Greece's improved deterrence capacities.\n\nIn response, Mitarachi said, Greece would further step up security in the Evros region by expanding a border fence and upgrading surveillance systems, including drones, cameras and other equipment in the area.\n\nThis investigation was made possible with the help of funding from the Pulitzer Center.\n\nCorrection, September 10, 2022: A previous version of this article incorrectly identified the Pulitzer Center.

    "The Column: Lowell mayor travels to Greece on city's dime": "EIGHT LOWELL officials and their family members are currently sightseeing in Kalamata, Greece, the city’s new cultural and economic partner across the Atlantic. It’s a union that both sides hope will be prosperous, as they aim to establish study abroad programming, strengthen imports and exports, and support the rich history of Greek Americans in Lowell.\n\nIt’s a once-in-a-lifetime trip for many in the delegation, including Mayor Sokhary Chau — it’s his first time in Europe, which he said he will not take for granted. Prior to his departure, Chau said he was especially excited to learn about the history of Kalamata and explore the main ancient ruins for personal enlightenment.\n\n“Greece to me is really the foundation of democracy,” Chau said in an interview. “The history of Greece especially, I only read them in books. Now I’m going to go experience that firsthand… I’m going to walk the footsteps of Socrates.”\n\nIt’s a nice sentiment, but undeniably tourist-y. Isn’t this supposed to be a business trip?\n\nWell, there are other, more “professional” excursions during the seven-day visit, including conversations with administrators from the University of the Peloponnese, a trip to the Greek Parliament and a meeting with the U.S. ambassador to Greece.\n\nBut a big question has emerged in the wake of the journey: Who’s paying for it?\n\nChau isn’t.\n\nHis airfare alone cost the city of Lowell $1,470.07, but it’s all in an effort “to foster cultural, educational, tourism, and business collaboration,” according to a letter he addressed to the City Council on Sept. 8. And he’s allegedly brought his wife and his son with him.\n\nThe city also approved Chau an additional $50 a day over eight days, which includes that first day of travel, and all together totals $1,870.07. It’s unclear where exactly this money is coming from.\n\nFor context, Chau makes about $30,000 a year as mayor, an increase from the $21,000 that the council approved in 2016. Comparatively, other councilors earn $25,000 annually, and City Manager Tom Golden gets a whopping $235,000.\n\nThe delegation left for Greece the evening of Sept. 21, arriving in Athens at 12:30 p.m. Thursday.\n\nFormer Lowell Mayor Bill Samaras spoke at the Sept. 13 council meeting, offering some background into establishing the sister cities, which has been a long time coming, given COVID-related interruptions.\n\nSamaras said he is pleased to see the partnership finally come to fruition, and the two countries will only benefit in many ways by working together.\n\n“It’s our hope as a group that we will be a model for the rest of the city for the creation of more sister cities,” Samaras said. “Because Lowell certainly is a welcoming city, a city of all groups and for all groups. This allows all groups to hold onto their heritage, and it makes us a stronger city, a stronger country.”\n\nInterestingly, Samaras didn’t ask for the council to fund his trip, nor did Dimitrios Mattheos, a board member of the Federation of Hellenic-American Societies of New England who was also at the council meeting and is part of the delegation. It appears as though Chau is the only one asking for the taxpayers to fund him.\n\nThis might be an issue of bad timing, too.\n\nResidents are facing a proposed 5.5% property tax increase in the next fiscal year, which the City Council voted to approve very recently. Many people voiced their displeasure with the motion back in June, so to have their sitting mayor take more money from their pockets probably isn’t sitting right with them.\n\nThe Sun actually received an email drawing attention to the “source of funding” for the international visit, referencing a previous article on the challenges many unhoused people in the city face, as well as their often fraught relationships with businesses in Downtown Lowell.\n\nAre our city officials’ priorities mixed up? How might they justify funding an overseas trip when there is a demonstrated lack of resources and support for people living right here, blocks from their offices?\n\nThere was absolutely no mention of the specific funding for the trip during last week’s council meeting, and Chau spoke very little, only to move the proceedings along. He did thank the police and other local government officials for their work accommodating Kalamata Mayor Athanasios Vasilopoulos and company.\n\n“It was great welcoming the Kalamata mayor’s delegation to the city of Lowell,” Chau said. “(What) made it possible was the support of the city managers and the chief of the police that provided the escort service and made sure that they would enjoy their stay in Lowell.”\n\nNo councilors offered any input, and a quick vote sealed Chau’s finances.\n\nThe best defense is good offense — not to give offense\n\nTHE “BAD Boys” of the Detroit Pistons were players you loved if you were a Pistons fan, and they were players you loved to hate, if you weren’t.\n\nTheir defense-oriented style of play was both theatrical swagger and physical intimidation. They rode their no-holds-bared playmaking all the way to back-to-back NBA championships in 1989 and 1990.\n\nSwagger, intimidation and theatrics are certainly key components of today’s political or politicized class, which seems to model itself on the Bad Boys’ methods and over-the-top displays (center Bill Laimbeer’s dramatic flops were legendary).\n\nWhich brings us to the 50 Venezuelan immigrants who were transported — across state lines, and allegedly through deceptive means — from Texas to Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, took almost gleeful credit for the stunt, saying that liberals’ (read: Democrats) surprise and indignation at how the migrants came into their community was “virtue-signaling” and “a fraud.”\n\nHe was referring to the fact that the cities to which migrants have been transported by Floridian and Texan taxpayers — like Washington, D.C., New York City and Chicago — are designated as sanctuary cities, or municipalities that offer sanctuary from federal immigration law.\n\nHow do you like those immigrants on your doorstep, now? DeSantis taunted. The southern border is the point of entry for an ongoing massive human migration from our Mexican and Central American neighbors — even South American neighbors. The fact that this took place during Latino Heritage Month lent a cynical and callous air to the ploy.\n\nOn the surface, it was an effective Bad Boys-style move. Catch your opponent off guard, harass them with constant badgering and trash-talking, inflame the crowd, throw sharp elbows, dish out hard fouls when the refs aren’t looking and claim the high ground as the aggrieved party when called out (a la the Laimbeer flop).\n\nBut are these the kind of moves that can win the Nov. 8 electoral championship? Is that the point of these seemingly choreographed events? Or are these just random acts of chaos to disrupt and destabilize our political conversation, further polarizing an already divided electorate?\n\nFormer Massachusetts state Sen. Dean Tran, a Republican 3rd Congressional District candidate, issued a statement this week that called the Martha’s Vineyard crisis an “unconscionable double standard.”\n\n“The Martha’s Vineyard incident highlights the sheer hypocrisy of the Biden-Pelosi and Trahan immigration policy,” read the statement. U.S. Rep. Lori Trahan holds the seat Tran is campaigning for.\n\n“As a former immigrant myself, whose family desperately sought refuge from Communist aggression, I am acutely aware of the fear and uncertainty immigrants face because I have experienced it myself,” Tran wrote.\n\nThe statement went on to say that moving the migrants from the small island community to the former Camp Edwards military base, 33 miles away on Cape Cod, “unmasked the nascent racism and exclusively of Martha’s Vineyard, a community that ardently supports the Biden regime.”\n\nTran called Biden’s immigration policy “non-existent.”\n\nPerhaps Abbott, DeSantis — maybe even Tran — are running these kinds of incidents “up the flagpole” to see how they play out. If it plays well with their base, expect to see more internal “migrations.”\n\nThe Bad Boys tactics worked exceeding well with their Detroit fan base, who packed the stands at their games. Eventually a series of debilitating player injuries — no doubt due to their aggressive play — as well as the high-flying, smooth moves of a shooting guard named Michael “Air” Jordan, who could switch the ball between hands while in flight to make a basket, ended the Bad Boys era forever.\n\nIt’s for the electorate to say if the smash-mouth, meat-head, gutter-style Bad Boys politics has also run its course because an “Air” Jordan is on the scene.\n\nTran’s statement suggests he could be that change agent.\n\n“When elected to the U.S. Congress, I will work tirelessly to develop and implement reform to our immigration laws that will improve opportunities for legal immigration, but will also protect the nation from the chaos that we are witnessing now,” he wrote.\n\nWith less than 45 days to the general election, it will soon be up to the voters as to whether they want a Bad Boy or an Air Jordan-style candidate leading the 3rd District.\n\nTrahan, in contrast to her Republican opponent, was one of several federal lawmakers to sign onto a letter led by U.S. Sen. Ed Markey urging the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Inspector General to review “Florida’s apparent misuse of federal pandemic relief funds from the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund,” according to a Sept. 16 press release.\n\n“According to reports, Florida has used federal funds intended to help communities recover from the coronavirus pandemic for an inhumane program to transport newly arrived immigrants,” the lawmakers wrote in the letter. “We believe this program misuses federal COVID-19 relief funds and violates federal law.\n\n“We request that you investigate Florida and take all necessary action — including potentially rescinding any misused funds — to stop this abuse of coronavirus relief programs,” the lawmakers continued. “States should not be permitted to use COVID-19 relief funds for any parochial interest unrelated to the pandemic, particularly for naked political conduct that imposes severe and unjust harms on disadvantaged groups of individuals.”\n\nOne MVP in the migrant story is a small nonprofit called La Colaborativa, in Chelsea, which works to provide lifesaving supports to community members living through a pandemic in Massachusetts’ hardest-hit city.\n\nExecutive Director Gladys Vega said donations have substantially increased since the migrant crisis hit the news, saying her organization is “proud to be a destination for these families and we will continue welcoming them with open arms.”\n\nVega said that in keeping with its sanctuary city focus, La Colaborativa welcomes immigrants with compassionate, experienced and bilingual staff in a safe and confidential space. They’ve been seeing more of them “come out of the shadows for services” since the Martha’s Vineyard crisis.\n\n“We make sure they have food, clothing, shelter, jobs, doctors, medication, and lawyers,” Vega said. “Whatever they need, we will find a way thanks to key partnerships with our local schools, hospitals, city departments, and legal partners. All of this is done with the highest level of dignity and care.”\n\nSounds like a full-court press, with a championship team, scoring points and winning fans and games with a high-flying style.\n\nMaybe the best defense is a good offense — not by giving offense.\n\nThis week’s Column was prepared by reporters Cameron Morsberger in Lowell and Melanie Gilbert on the Martha’s Vineyard migrant issue.",
    "Greece: Government Takes Another Crack at Preventing Free Press – Reports of Pushbacks and Non-Response Continue": "In its latest crackdown on free press the Greek government has threatened Der Spiegel with legal action over its reporting of the tragic death of a child stuck on an islet in the Evros region with authorities unresponsive for an extended period despite interim measures from the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). Meanwhile, reports of non-response and ignoring of ECtHR as well as pushbacks continue to mount.\n\nThe freedom of press in Greece, ranked 108 of 180 countries on the 2022 World Press Freedom Index published by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), has been declining over years partly as the result of government approaches. In a response to the European Commission in relation to the ongoing wiretapping scandal around the use of spyware targeting opposition politicians and journalists, permanent representative to the EU Ioannis Vrailes refers to amendments of Greek legislation allowing such measures as a matter of national security. An amendment allegedly deemed necessary because of the instrumentalisation of migration and proven cases of espionage. The most recent example of the hostile environment for critical journalists not least when reporting on asylum and migration is the threats of legal action against Der Spiegel reporter, Giorgos Christides by the Ministry of Migration and Asylum. The threats were made in the context of Der Spiegel reporting of the death on 9 August of a five-year old girl while she was stranded along with 38 others on an islet in the Evros region between Greece and Turkiye. Reportedly, after initially being pushed forth and back by Greek and Turkish authorities. Despite interim measures by the ECtHR on 20 July initiated by ECRE member Greek Council for Refugees (GCR) and HumanRights360, indicating action from Greece, authorities rejected responsibility and the group was only rescued after great delay on 16 August.\n\nThe death of the little girl has caused a significant public outcry and Der Spiegel has faced severe pressure from the government over its reporting. The Ministry of Migration and Asylum alleges that Christidis accessed the Reception and Identification Center (RIC) of Fylakio under false pretext when he interviewed the family of the deceased girl thereby breaking rules of confidentiality. Minister of Migration and Asylum, Notis Mitarachi and Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis continues to deny responsibility and have questioned the reliability of information on the incident – the latter even the name of the dead girl although it was included in information submitted to ECtHR by GCR and HumanRights360. Local media defines the active role of top-politicians as a direct intervention into an on-going investigation by the Prosecutor’s Office into the circumstances around the tragic incident. Notis Mitarachi claimed to have alternative data before testifying in the case. Christidis has refuted all allegations and recently expressed his: “deepest thanks to the hundreds of people, from friends and Greek & foreign colleagues, to politicians, judges, MEPs, NGO actors, and many many other people” who have been contacting me since yesterday in support. The Evros region has been the scene of controversy and a long-term stand-off between Greece and Turkiye and new measures including an extension of existing border fortifications have been announced by Greek authorities.\n\nAn ever-mounting body of evidence and reports of pushbacks and lack of response to alerts for assistance including despite interim measures by ECtHR by Greek authorities have been met with deflection and denials. Over the last weeks alone the NGO hotline Alarm Phone has reported a series of incidents in the Evros region as well as the Aegean and the mainland – off Methoni cape, Peloponnisos 24 August, Samos 24 August, off Kalamata on 26 August, Mikros Kehros August 26, Farmakonisi 28 August, off Samos 30 August, off Rhodes 30 August, Peloponnese, 1 September. Further, coverage of new reports of pushback incidents continue in international media. On 24 August, Greek Minister of Civil Protection Takis Theodorikakos stated that 25,000 irregular migrants had attempted to enter Greece from Turkey between 1 and 24 August. Notis Mitarachi, told InfoMigrants the following day that 1,500 to 1,700 attempts are made daily to cross the border from Turkey. None of the two government officials explained how these statistics were compiled or how Greece prevented such attempts. However, as pointed out by InfoMigrants these figures differ widely from official UN statistics. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), 7,375 migrants have entered Greece since 1 January 2022 and the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) counted 7,936 arrivals during the same period. A recent response to questions from MEP, Erik Marquardt, European Home Affairs Commissioner, Ylva Johansson did little to clarify the position of the Commission to pushback incidents but emphasized the Greek responsibility to investigate: “Any act of violence or pushback is illegal and must be investigated by the national authorities responsible to establish the facts and take the necessary follow-up actions”. However, fundamental rights officer at the European Border and Coastguard Agency (Frontex) that has been accused of being implicated in violations in Greece stated in an interview with the Guardian: “It has been clear to me that Greece is one of the countries that needs enhanced monitoring,” he told the Guardian. “I think that what is missing now from my side, is increasing the pressure, increasing the concreteness of what I think should be done in order to prevent violations.”\n\nFor further information:\n\nThis article appeared in the ECRE Weekly Bulletin.

    "Greece to allies: Crack down on Turkey or risk another Ukraine": "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has stepped up his rhetoric against Greece in recent days | Adem Altan/AFP via Getty Images\n\nATHENS — Greece says that Europe risks another Ukraine situation if it doesn’t put an end to Turkey’s inflammatory rhetoric toward Athens.\n\nEarlier this week, the Greek foreign ministry sent letters to NATO, the United Nations and the EU complaining about comments by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan that it said were “unprovoked, unacceptable and an insult against Greece and the Greek people” and asking the organizations to condemn Ankara’s behavior.\n\n“By not doing so in time or by underestimating the seriousness of the matter, we risk witnessing again a situation similar to that currently unfolding in some other part of our Continent,” Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias wrote in the letters, dated Monday and Tuesday, alluding to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nErdoğan has stepped up his rhetoric against Greece in recent days, amid what Ankara sees as a growing military buildup on the Greek Aegean islands, close to Turkey’s coastline. In a repeated, thinly veiled threat, he said: “We can come down suddenly one night when the time comes.”\n\n“They have islands in their possession, they have bases on these islands; if illegitimate threats against us continue based on them, our patience has a limit,” he said Tuesday during a visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nGreece slammed Erdoğan’s remarks as “openly threatening” in nature and tone.\n\n“The Turkish attitude is a destabilizing factor for NATO’s unity and cohesion, weakening the southern flank of the Alliance at a moment of crisis,” Dendias said, adding that Greece is “currently witnessing one of their worst periods for years.”\n\nDendias stressed that the “openly threatening nature and tone are more than obvious, thus dispelling any doubts as to their intended purpose, as well as any allegations that they are only meant for domestic reasons in view of the next elections in the country.”\n\nDespite being NATO allies, the neighboring countries have been at odds for decades over a number of bilateral disputes, including maritime boundaries, overlapping claims to their continental shelves and the long-running Cyprus dispute.\n\nMuch to the Turks’ ire, Greece granted the U.S. military open-ended access to key bases in an update of their mutual defense cooperation agreement in October 2021. Erdoğan cut off all bilateral talks with Greece last May after Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis urged U.S. lawmakers to block arms sales to Turkey. Military provocations increased soon after, creating the most volatile situation since the two sides almost came to blows in 2020 over Turkey conducting energy exploration in waters claimed by Greece.\n\nOn Monday, the EU expressed its concerns over Erdoğan’s comments, while the U.S. State Department called them “unhelpful” and repeated that Greek sovereignty over the Aegean islands is “not in question.”\n\nAnkara also sent letters to the EU, NATO and the U.N. on September 1, accusing Greece of engaging in “unlawful actions” and making “maximalist demands” in the Aegean.",

    "Spying scandal clouds Greece’s political future": "Press play to listen to this article Voiced by Amazon Polly\n\nATHENS — A persistent espionage scandal has upended Greece’s political landscape, fueling doubts the country can form a stable government after the next election.\n\nThe controversy started last month when the government acknowledged it had wiretapped an opposition leader’s phone — a move it called legal but wrong. It then quickly blossomed into a labyrinthine story that involved controversial spyware being planted on the phones of an ever-expanding network of politicians and journalists.\n\nBut the government has claimed no connection to — or even knowledge of — these broader cases. And after firing two top government officials, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis is now holding firm, insisting he must stay the course amid gathering economic storm clouds, a war raging nearby and increasingly bellicose rhetoric from rival Turkey.\n\n“I’m not going to be the overseer of political instability,” Mitsotakis said Saturday night at an annual trade fair in the northern city of Thessaloniki — Greece’s biggest annual political event. “I will lead the country safely to the end of the four-year term and then we will be measured.”\n\nThe public is split on whether they want to see Mitsotakis stick around until then, though. Two recent polls showed just over half of Greeks feel the prime minister should resign. And with elections set to be held sometime in the next nine months, Mitsotakis’ potential coalition partners are trying to pounce on the crisis.\n\nHanging over everything is the possibility that more espionage plots will emerge. Already, there has been a consistent drip of fresh allegations in the Greek press in recent weeks.\n\nStill, Mitsotakis has reason to be confident that he and his center-right New Democracy party may emerge relatively unscathed. Even though some party members are grumbling about the revelations, New Democracy itself has not suffered in the polls. And voters appear far more focused on the tempestuous economy than they are on espionage.\n\n“Mitsotakis pledged not to go to elections in autumn, after a good tourist season, but in spring, after a very difficult winter,” said Athanasios Diamantopoulos, a Greek political specialist at Panteion University. “By then, reports of the wiretapping will not have died down, but there will be so many economic troubles that this will be the main stake.”\n\nCracks from within\n\nThe lingering scandal has not been without consequences — far from it.\n\nTo start, there were the resignations, which included one of Mitsotakis’ top aides and his intelligence chief. Those came after the government conceded it had authorized a wiretap of Nikos Androulakis, a European Parliament member who leads the third-largest party in Greece’s parliament, the center-left Pasok.\n\nMaking matters worse, intrusive spyware known as Predator was also found on Androulakis’ phone, in addition to those of a journalist and a lawmaker from the main opposition party, the left-wing Syriza. The government has denied any links to those buggings.\n\nStill, there are lingering questions about what, exactly, occurred. Mitsotakis has refused to explain why his political opponent was spied on, pointing to national security concerns.\n\nThe silence has left some New Democracy members uneasy.\n\n“In such situations, catharsis occurs only when they are fully clarified,” Kostas Karamanlis, a former Greek prime minister and one-time head of New Democracy, said during a recent party event in Crete. “For these events to have been caused by government initiative is not only undemocratic and illegal but so far beyond the bounds of morbid imagination and political nonsense that it is unthinkable.”\n\nThe frustrations have spilled into parliament, where Nikitas Kaklamanis, a New Democracy member and deputy house speaker, said he now opposes a provision he and the ruling party passed depriving citizens of the ability to find out if they are under surveillance. Pasok also initially backed the legislation.\n\nNew Democracy parliament member Konstantinos Tzavaras even branded the Greek media a “disgrace” for not covering the scandal more.\n\n“The functioning of the constitution has taken a severe blow and the prime minister must rise to the occasion,” said Tzavaras, one of the party’s representatives in a parliamentary inquiry investigating the issue.\n\nWith elections set to be held sometime in the next nine months, t he public is split on whether they want to see Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis stick around | Aris Messinis/Eurokinissi/AFP via Getty Images\n\nDespite the public reprimands, a full revolt from within the party remains unlikely — the number of disaffected New Democracy figures has not increased in recent days.\n\nTo some political specialists in the country, Mitsotakis’ staying power is a symptom of a malfunctioning Greek political system.\n\n“If we were in any democratic state we would not have political instability,” said Nikos Marantzidis, a political science professor at the University of Macedonia. “The PM would have already resigned and succession developments would have been initiated.”\n\nMitsotakis, Marantzidis argued, “identifies his personal future with the future of democracy and the country when he says that if I resign there will be instability.”\n\nMitsotakis struck back at that thinking on Sunday, saying: “People know us. If not us, then who?”\n\nAn eye on elections\n\nUltimately, Mitsotakis is likely to spend the coming months both trying to keep his party together — and trying to navigate an ever-more complicated election, which must be held by next July and is expected to take place in the spring.\n\nUntil the spying revelations surfaced, New Democracy and Pasok were seen as heading toward forming a centrist coalition government after the upcoming elections.\n\nThat’s all over.\n\n“It is now very difficult for Pasok voters to move towards New Democracy, but even more difficult for them to put pressure on their party leadership to participate in a coalition,” said Diamantopoulos, the Greek political specialist at Panteion University.\n\nMitsotakis put the blame for that on Androulakis himself, accusing him of playing politics with his surveillance.\n\n“I believe that what happened helped Androulakis to walk a line that was predetermined, that of rupture with New Democracy,” he said, alleging that the Pasok leader is in “disharmony” with his own voters.\n\nGreece’s next national election will be held under a proportional representation system, making it almost impossible for any party to gather a majority. Because of that, the country will most likely head to a second election, which would be held under a system granting bonus seats to the first party. Current polling, however, shows no party close to reaching an absolute majority, even with a second-round bonus.\n\nBefore the spying scandal, that reality had fueled expectations that New Democracy and Pasok would be pressed into a coalition. Now, with the two parties squabbling, speculation is running rampant about what coalition formations could emerge from such a divisive moment.\n\nMitsotakis could link up with the nationalist, Russophile Greek Solution party. Yet that would represent a U-turn for the prime minister, who styles himself as a moderate and pro-U.S. politician.\n\nOn Sunday, Mitsotakis said that he doesn’t feel “at all close” to Greek Solution but didn’t exclude a potential tie-up, arguing he is “not ready to talk about what the options will be” if a coalition is needed. He also left open the option of teaming up with specific lawmakers from various political parties to bolster his standing.\n\nRemarkably, a team-up between New Democracy and Pasok is still on the table, according to political analysts in Athens — but realistically only without Mitsotakis as the prime minister. That’s not something Mitsotakis will likely go for.\n\n“The leader of the first party must be the prime minister, even in the case of a coalition government,” the prime minister underlined on Sunday.\n\nSimilarly, a grand coalition between New Democracy, Pasok and Syriza — an approach Pasok favors — would likely require new leadership within New Democracy.\n\n“This is possible, but won’t be simple,” said Marantzidis, the political science professor. “As long as [Mitsotakis] identifies his personal future with the future of democracy and the country, this will have a negative impact on developments after the elections.”\n\nMitsotakis himself warned against another possibility — a coalition that pulls together all the center-left and left-wing opposition parties to form a government omitting New Democracy, even if it finishes first.\n\n“This will be a political monstrosity and I have to inform and warn people about this possibility,” Mitsotakis said.\n\nPolls hold steady\n\nDespite the rapidly shifting political dynamics, polling last week showed limited damage to the government over the spy scandal.\n\nDepending on the poll, New Democracy has only slid between 0.2 and 1.7 percentage points since the scandal erupted. Meanwhile, opposition parties Syriza and Pasok merely gained between 0.5 and 1 percentage point.\n\n“We have been surprised by the short-term reactions in the past,” said Giorgos Arapoglou, the general manager of Pulse polling company. Arapoglou recalled that after a massive 2018 fire that saw 100 people perish, the government first gained in the polls before losing power in 2019.\n\nUltimately, Arapoglou said the economy is usually the biggest factor in elections. Recent polls back up his theory. In a Marc survey, 84 percent of Greeks said they were concerned about inflation and the looming energy crisis this winter. Only 16 percent expressed worries about the wiretapping discoveries.\n\nWhen just considering politics, though, the espionage story does seem to loom large. A recent GPO poll showed nearly 70 percent of Greeks thought the case was a “very” or “quite” important part of the current political scene. Well over half, 59 percent, also thought Mitsotakis bore some responsibility, while about the same amount said the case had diminished their trust in government.\n\nAnd notably, multiple polls show a slim majority wants Mitsotakis to step aside — a Public Issue poll had it at 54 percent, while a ProRata poll put it at 51 percent.\n\nSome political analysts believe it’s just a matter of time until the issue catches up with the prime minister.\n\n“Obviously the government strategy is to forget what is happening,” said Marantzidis. “But,” he added, “one way or the other, just as Nixon didn’t avoid the truth, Mitsotakis will not be able to avoid it either.”",

    "Turkey-Greece Tensions Could Disrupt NATO Unity, Experts Warn": "Turkey and Greece, both NATO members, have been at loggerheads for decades over territorial and airspace claims in and over the Aegean Sea. As the historic rivals escalate their war of words, analysts warn about the risk of current tension spilling into NATO business at a time when there is a need to focus on unity against Russia amid its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe latest spat began when Turkey accused its neighbor of locking onto Turkish fighter jets with its Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missile systems deployed on the island of Crete. Ankara also said Greek pilots placed Turkish aircraft under a radar lock over the Eastern Mediterranean during a NATO mission last month.\n\nAthens dismissed Turkish claims and accused the country of violating its airspace.\n\nAs both countries lodged complaints with NATO about the incidents, the deletion of a tweet by NATO Allied Land Command (LANDCOM) congratulating Turkey on its Victory Day, following a demarche by Greece, caused fury in Ankara.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan doubled down when he spoke earlier this week at Teknofest, an event dubbed as Turkey’s biggest aviation and aerospace festival.\n\n“Look at history. If you cross the line any further, there will be a heavy price to pay. Don’t forget Izmir,” he said, alluding to a defeat of occupying Greek forces in the western city in 1922.\n\nHe echoed those words earlier this week, warning “Turkey could come all of a sudden one night.”\n\nHis remarks were perceived by Greek officials as threats, suggesting Turkey could take military action against the Aegean Sea islands. Athens says it is ready to defend its sovereignty.\n\nGreek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias asked NATO, European Union partners and the United Nations to formally condemn what he described as “outrageous and increasingly aggressive talk by Turkish officials” in letters addressed to three international bodies, copies of which were seen by The Associated Press.\n\nIn a statement sent to VOA, a State Department representative called on the two allies to resolve their differences diplomatically.\n\nPointing to the Russian invasion in Ukraine, Washington said statements that could raise tensions between NATO allies are “particularly unhelpful,” adding “Greece’s sovereignty over the islands is not in question.”\n\nThe Pentagon did not comment on Turkish claims that Greece locked its S-300 surface-to-air missiles onto Turkey’s jets last week but said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin emphasized the need to reduce tensions in the Aegean through constructive dialogue during his previous talks with Turkish and Greek counterparts.\n\nPossibility of war\n\n\n\nDeep-rooted friction brought Turkey and Greece almost to the point of war three times in the last 50 years.\n\nAnalysts speaking to VOA say they don’t see a resolution any time soon, noting the troubled history of bilateral relations and the “tight politics” in the two nations’ capitals.\n\n“It will take a mediator who has the skill and some leverage to be able to come up with something that these two nations can agree with. But I don’t see that on the horizon,” said Jim Townsend, former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense on European and NATO policy. Townsend is currently an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security Transatlantic Security Program.\n\nPhilip Breedlove, a retired U.S. Air Force general who served as NATO supreme allied commander from 2013 to 2016, said the long-standing problems between Turkey and Greece rise and fall over time.\n\n“The leadership in Turkey is pushing the country in certain directions that have caused these tensions to rise once again as they have over the years,” the former top NATO commander said in a phone interview with VOA on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nBreedlove, who is now a senior fellow with the Middle East Institute, said NATO and the United States have managed similar tensions in the past and the alliance is still up to the task.\n\nConcerns about disrupting NATO unity\n\nThe recent spat between Turkey and Greece takes place as NATO is focusing on displaying a united front against Russia in the face of its invasion in Ukraine.\n\n\n\nExperts are worried that if the tension escalates to the point of hostilities, Russian President Vladimir Putin can take advantage.\n\n\n\n“Whatever little cracks can appear in European unity, Putin can make them even larger and in fact split the rock. So, it not only undercuts European unity but also can spill over into NATO councils if one or the other country uses NATO as a weapon to hurt the other,” Townsend said.\n\n\n\nHe warned that those cracks can be exploited by Moscow as winter approaches; Russia has already cut back on its gas exports to Europe.\n\nElection dynamics\n\nTurkey and Greece will both head to the polls for crucial elections next year.\n\nTurkish President Erdogan is said to be facing a major challenge to his 20-year rule amid the country’s economic woes and immigration problems.\n\nGreek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, elected in 2019, reportedly suffered a popularity loss to some degree because of rising energy prices partly driven by the war in Ukraine.\n\n“Rhetoric on both sides has always been part of the problem and it’s something that doesn’t help things,” said Townsend.\n\nBreedlove agrees. He believes some of this is “playing to an internal audience.”\n\nBalancing act\n\nThe United States is known to have maintained a balance between regional rivals Turkey and Greece, which it says are both important NATO allies.\n\nAthens and Washington extended a bilateral military agreement for five years and the deal was ratified by the Greek parliament in the summer, days before the Greek prime minister’s visit to Washington in mid-May. The deal gives the U.S. more military access to bases in Greece.\n\nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley met with his Greek counterpart, Konstantinos Floros, at the Pentagon in July. “The military leaders discussed mutual items of interest,” said a statement from his office.\n\nThat visit was followed by Greek Defense Minister Nikolaos Panagiotopoulos’ visit to the Pentagon July 18 to meet with Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. The two discussed the “growing defense partnership between the United States and Greece and the close cooperation on basing, [and] defense modernization,” according to a statement from the Pentagon.\n\nThey also discussed “the need to reduce tensions in the Aegean through constructive dialogue.”\n\nAustin spoke with his Turkish counterpart, Hulusi Akar, July 25, discussing “the need for continued efforts to reduce tensions in the Aegean through constructive dialogue.”\n\nTurkish and Greek defense requests\n\nGreece is seeking to acquire F-35 fighter jets from the United States. The country formally requested the fighter jets in June.\n\nTurkey was kicked out of the F-35 program because of its purchase of an advanced S-400 missile system from Russia. Ankara wants to buy F-16s and modernization kits from Washington. U.S. weapons sales to foreign countries are subject to congressional approval.\n\nAnalysts argue that Turkey’s decision to buy the Russian S-400 system was a huge blow to defense cooperation between Washington and Ankara, which they say has traditionally been very strong.\n\nTownsend, who spent 30 years at the Pentagon working on Turkey issues, tells VOA that he “mourns the loss of [the] close working relationship with Turkey,” hoping it can be restored again.\n\nHe is hopeful that the United States will be able to provide the F-16s requested by Turkey, saying he thinks the administration — working with Congress — will be able to allow that transfer to happen.\n\nRetired U.S. Air Force General Breedlove maintains the same hope.\n\nFocusing on ‘common threat’\n\nThe former NATO commander argues that Turkey made some security decisions that aligned it more closely with “NATO’s enemy,” in reference to its S-400 purchase from Russia, which was identified as the most significant and direct threat to the allies’ security in NATO’s strategic concept document.\n\n“The enemy is not Greece versus Turkey and Turkey versus Greece. It is NATO versus Russia. I would want Turkey to have that if they can't have the F-35. We need to understand who the enemy is,” Breedlove tells VOA.\n\nHe said the United States would want to move forward with Turkey because it is an incredibly important part of the NATO alliance despite recent lows in the relationship, adding he cannot speak to the policy of the current U.S. government.\n\nBut he also acknowledged that “Greece is a little more aligned with where America wants to go in the area,” saying Washington would want to have the same kind of relationship with Turkey.\n\nHe calls on the United States and Turkey to focus on how they can bring back the same level of cooperation rather than growing apart.\n\nErdogan’s criticism of the West’s Russia policy\n\nMeanwhile, Erdogan has recently accused Western nations of provoking Russia, without naming any.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference in Serbia, he suggested the “West’s policy on Russia was based on provocations.”\n\nHe vowed to continue Turkey’s balancing policy between Russia and Ukraine, adding Russia is not a country that one can underestimate.\n\n“Russia has cut off natural gas now. Prices in Europe have skyrocketed. Everyone now broods on how they will get through this winter,” Erdogan said.\n\nTurkey supplies Ukraine with combat drones, which are used by Kyiv to destroy Russian targets in the conflict.\n\nAnkara also played a role with the United Nations as a mediator to secure the deal that allowed grain exports to resume from the ports in Ukraine. But it has not joined the Western sanctions against Russia.\n\nThis story originated in VOA’s Turkish Service. The service's Dilge Timocin contributed.",
    "Greece: Students' protests ongoing in central Athens as of late Sept. 17": "Event\n\nSeveral student organizations have gathered in central Athens as of late Sept. 17 to denounce the introduction of police patrols on university campuses. Police have reportedly employed tear gas and water cannons to disperse the demonstrators.\n\nIncreased security, as well as localized transport and business disruptions, are likely for the duration of the demonstrations in central Athens. Security forces will likely remain deployed. Riot police will almost certainly employ crowd control measures, particularly if the protesters refuse to heed their instructions.\n\nContext\n\nAdditional demonstrations in opposition to the deployment of police on campuses in Athens are almost certain. Major protests have occurred near Constitution Squares in Athens and Thessaloniki, Sept. 8. The demonstrations have primarily been organized by several student organizations, including the Students Struggle Front (MAS) and Communist Youth of Greece (KNE). The protests are in response to the New Democracy (ND) political party's deployment of University Institutions Protection Teams (OPPI), which allegedly aims to protect academic centers from anarchism and vandalism.\n\nAdvice\n\nAvoid all protests as a routine security precaution and to mitigate associated disruptions. Heed instructions from security services and leave the area at the first sign of a confrontation.

    "Diaspora Greeks discover Greece": "In the last two to three years, something unprecedented and particularly optimistic has happened. Thousands of our compatriots from the distant diasporas of the US, Australia and Canada have discovered Greece. To some extent, this happened because of the coronavirus pandemic. Our country stood out in the way it dealt with it, while there were quite a few people who decided to come to Greece and work from here.\n\nAt the same time, the country’s brand improved dramatically, becoming fashionable again, after many decades. It is impressive how popular Greek destinations are in the US and Canada. But the trend is being led by people who have nothing to do with what we used to think of as the “uncle from Brooklyn.” We are talking about the second- and third-generation Greeks who have studied and improved spectacularly in terms of education and living standards.\n\nBut these people also come to their country and are surprised to find that Greece is not the “poor relation” that they had in their minds from their grandparents’ time. It is a country with a high level of services in some areas, with roads and infrastructure much better than those of big American cities and people who combine professionalism with warmth. They are enthusiastic about what they discover, from Greek wines to museums and of course the more relaxed way of life. They visit their ancestral villages and search for their roots. Some go a step further and try to find out how to acquire Greek citizenship.\n\nFor years we have been looking for ways to bring the diaspora closer to the homeland. Over the years, it became clear that this cannot be done through state-fed pharaonic schemes. After all, the basic condition for their return was to make Greece more attractive for them. Of course, the ties with the country were maintained and, in difficult times, various organizations played a decisive role by bring young diaspora Greeks either for the summer or for a year of university studies.\n\nBut what we are seeing now is a new phenomenon. It fills us with joy and optimism because our compatriots are returning to their places of origin and are Greece’s best possible representatives and ambassadors.\n\nYou hear them talk about the country and you feel like you’re getting an antidote to the usual domestic misery and cynicism that – unfortunately – manages to gobble up even the usually forgiving Greek sun.",
    "Greece: Government States 150,000 People have been “Averted” but Denies Pushbacks, ‘Safe Third Country’ Inadmissibility Decisions Continue as Hate Crimes are On the Rise in Türkiye": "Minister of Migration and Asylum, Notis Mitarachi confirms that more than 150,000 irregular migrants were “averted” this year but denies pushbacks. Greece continues to deem asylum applications inadmissible based on Türkiye being a ‘safe third country’ as hate crimes against Syrian refugees are on the rise in the country.\n\nNotis Mitarachi told local media that: “The entry of 154,102 irregular migrants was averted since the start of the year. Around 50,000 attempted to invade Greece in August alone”. The minister did not specify how these people had been blocked from entering Greece but denied any involvement by Greek authorities in pushbacks accusing Türkiye of engaging in “violent push forward”. According to the latest asylum statistics released by Refugee Support Aegean (RSA) based on responses to parliamentary questions and government reporting just 14,110 asylum applicants were registered in Greece over the first six months of 2022.\n\nPushbacks and non-response to alerts of stranded people and ignoring of interim measures by the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has long been reported in the Evros region separating Greece and Türkiye. On 7 September the NGO hotline Alarm Phone released detailed accounts from survivors of “brutal practices and the infrastructure of violence against people on the move in the Evros/Meric region”. Since March 2022, ECRE member the Greek Council for Refugees (GCR) has represented: “444 Syrian and 32 Turkish refugees, including many children, before the European Court of Human Rights, by filing 19 applications for interim measures (Rule 39), requesting to be granted humanitarian assistance and access to the asylum procedure”. While, ECtHR granted the requested interim measures for all cases ordering the Greek government not to remove the refugees from Greek territory and to provide them with food, water and proper medical care, GCR note: “Some of the refugees of these 19 groups have been formally arrested by the Greek authorities but most of them complain they have been pushed back to Turkey”. The organisation further states: ”both with respect to those stranded on the islets and those in the Greek mainland, the refugees who complain that they have been pushed back to Turkey, also complain that they were informally arrested by the Greek authorities, informally detained for a few hours in an unspecified detention facility in the Evros region, they were treated with violence, they were transferred to the Evros river bank, from where they were forcibly put in boats and pushed back to Turkey”. For weeks of August, Greek authorities claimed unable to locate a group of 38 people stranded on an islet in the Evros region – leading to the death of a little girl – despite being provided with “GPS coordinates, which were confirmed by live locations and metadata in photos and other material the asylum-seekers had sent”. A Deutsche Welle investigation questions whether Greece is “failing to deploy EU-funded surveillance system at Turkish border as intended?” The outlet states: “Less than two kilometers (about a mile) away from the group’s shared location, on a hill overlooking sunflower and wheat fields and the road that runs parallel to the islet, stands a surveillance pylon equipped with radar, heat sensors and cameras. This tech-laden pylon is believed to be part of the newly-expanded surveillance system that Greek police could have used to locate the asylum-seekers on the islet”. However, ironically at the BalkanInsight can reveal that Greece implemented illegal monitoring of asylum seekers. “With money from the EU’s pandemic-recovery fund, systems to monitor the movements of asylum seekers in Greece were designed and launched without basic data safeguards required under EU law” the outlet writes. According to BalkanInsight: “Planning for the two systems – Hyperion and Centaur – began in 2020, the former monitoring movement in and out of state-run asylum camps and the latter deploying behavioural analysis algorithms and transmitting CCTV and drone footage to a control room set up inside the Ministry of Migration and Asylum”.\n\nIn June 2021 the Greek government issued a controversial Joint Ministerial Decision (JMD) deeming Türkiye a safe third country for people originating from the main refugee producing countries including Syria. Despite Türkiye refusing to accept returns from Greece since March 2020 this has allowed Greek authorities to refuse asylum claims as inadmissible. According to RSA’s statistical update on the Greek asylum system for the first half of 2022: “The number of inadmissibility decisions based on the “safe third country” concept dropped to 1,137. Most concerned the mainland as only 251 were issued in the border procedure. Three out of four claims processed based on the national list of “safe third countries” were deemed admissible. RSA recalls that: “despite the drop in inadmissibility decisions based on JMD 42799/2021 in 2022, a large number of applicants whose initial claims had arbitrarily been dismissed on “safe third country” grounds resorted to lodging subsequent applications as the sole avenue for ensuring their case would be heard, in light of the absolute lack of readmission prospects to Turkey for over two years. Many of those applications, however, were again dismissed as inadmissible, this time for want of new substantial elements, thereby leaving people in legal limbo again”. On 2 September the Greek Asylum Service granted refugee status to two Syrian brothers who had submitted subsequent applications for international protection on Kos. According to Equal Rights Beyond Borders that filed a legal remedy against their detention before the Administrative Court of Rhodes in June, the asylum service on Kos accepted its argumentation in the conclusion that: “given the existence of the decision of the – Administrative Court of Rhodes in which, on the basis of the personalized judgment, it is accepted that the applicant cannot be returned to Turkey, as no returns are carried out and the subsequent application should be considered admissible as the claims presented by the applicant are new and substantial (inability to return to Turkey) and his application should be examined on the merits…”\n\nMeanwhile, Türkiye is becoming an increasingly hostile environment for the 3.6 million registered Syrian refugees registered in the country that is currently seeing rising inflation and costs of living. While, there are no official statistics relating to violent attacks on Syrian refugees reported incidents include incidents of young Syrians killed by mobs. Metin Corabatir, president of the Research Center on Asylum and Migration (IGAM) points to far-right politicians using Syrians to stoke tension and media “fueling these tensions by disseminating misinformation about Syrians…” Referencing the recent killing of the Syrian teenager, Fares Elali, migration policy analyst at the Ankara-based think-tank TEPAV, Omar Kadkoy stated: “The deterrent here is the rule of law where the penalty is proportionate to the crime. It is skewed justice to make announcements of deporting Syrians for sharing videos on social media, for example, and not informing the public about the punishment of Fares’ killer or killers”. Another danger facing Syrian refugees is potential deportations – mass deportations of Syrians have been reported over the past years.\n\nA reported prospect of a normalization of relations between Türkiye and Syrian President Bashar Assad’s regime would increase this risk. “If Turkey goes down the path of rapprochement without considering the agency of Syrians in any voluntary return, Syrians will be left between a rock and a hard place. The alternative? The shores of the Aegean again,” Kadkoy said.\n\nFor further information:\n\nThis article appeared in the ECRE Weekly Bulletin. You can subscribe to the Weekly Bulletin here.",

    "Spain, Greece, Turkey: Most Brits think holiday hotspots will be ‘too hot’ to visit by 2027": "Most Brits think Spain, Greece, and Turkey will be ‘too hot’ to visit by 2027, as climate change drives temperatures up.\n\nEvery summer, travellers from the drizzly UK flock to Europe for the sunshine.\n\nBut with the mercury steadily rising year-on-year, this trend could shift, new research suggests.\n\nAccording to a UK survey by InsureandGo - a specialist travel insurance provider - climate change is altering people’s holiday expectations.\n\nIn a poll of more than 2,000 respondents, 71 per cent thought that parts of Europe would be too hot to visit over summer by 2027.\n\nThe results are “staggering,” says Chris Rolland, CEO of InsureandGo travel insurance.\n\n“UK holiday makers are really paying attention to what is going on in the world in terms of global warming.\n\n“Though the picture may seem worrying now, there is hope that these predictions will not come to fruition if we can get a collective handle on climate change by sticking to net zero targets and reducing our overall consumption.”\n\nWill UK tourists keep visiting Europe as temperatures rise?\n\nSpanish tourism may be hit hardest by the increasing temperatures. Before the pandemic, more than 15 million UK residents travelled to the country every single year. But nearly two thirds (65 per cent) are concerned that it will be too warm by 2027.\n\nGreece - another popular travel destination for Brits - may also lose significant tourism traffic, with 59 per cent of people concerned about the heat.\n\nBarcelona is a popular tourist spot - but will rising temperatures drive would-be visitors away? Canva\n\nMore than half of those polled said they would avoid Turkey (55 per cent) and Cyprus (51 per cent) by 2027. Portugal and Italy could also lose potential visitors, with 49 per cent and 42 per cent of respondents respectively claiming the locations would be too hot.\n\nBut there might be no respite at home, either. Nearly one-in-five Brits think that the UK will be too hot by 2027.\n\nOverall, concerns about heat rise with age. While 53 per cent of people aged 18-34 said Spain will be too hot to visit by 2027, 83 per cent of over 65s said the same.\n\nThis is a trend that follows through the data - 43 per cent of 18–34-year-olds said Greece would be too hot in 2027, compared to 77 per cent of over 65s.\n\nWhere are temperatures rising across Europe?\n\nEurope has just recorded its hottest ever summer. Across the continent, residents and tourists alike sweltered through unprecedented heatwaves and drought.\n\nIt was the second consecutive blistering summer for Europe, with average temperatures 0.4 degrees Celsius higher than the previous record set in 2021.\n\nSummer temperatures of over 50°C could become a reality in Europe.\n\n“The chances each summer of seeing really extreme temperatures are pretty high now,” said Professor Peter Stott, a Met Office meteorologist, after Sicily recorded a 48.8°C reading in 2021.\n\n“We can’t say exactly when it is likely to happen, but Europe will need to prepare for the eventuality of further records being broken with temperatures above 50.0°C being possible in Europe in future, most likely close to the Mediterranean where the influence of hot air from North Africa is strongest.”\n\nHuman-induced global warming is responsible for these changes.\n\nThe Earth’s average surface temperature has risen by around 1.1°C since the pre-industrial period (1850-1900). In Europe, this figure is closer to 1.8°C.\n\nWhere will tourists go to escape the heat?\n\nEverywhere will be impacted by rising temperatures. However, the survey results indicate that would-be travellers may be drawn to colder climes.\n\nJust four per cent of people think that Scandinavia and Switzerland will be too hot to visit, while five per cent say the same about the Netherlands.\n\n“The family summer holiday will certainly not go away,” Rolland says.\n\n“Our research does suggest however, that it may well change in terms of holiday makers moving toward cooler climates - or perhaps that Easter and Christmas will become the school holidays when more families head abroad for their break. I think this research is a real eye opener that things need to change - and fast.”\n\nPart of the change will be making travel more sustainable - swapping flights for trains and avoiding extractive tourism.",

    "Turkey obsessed with Greece": "The Turkish economy is in a very poor state and Erdogan will, reasonably, lose the election. You cannot know how an authoritarian leader will react, but we do know that the more the economy worsens, the more he’ll use other issues to draw votes. It is possible, for example, that he’ll cause crises in foreign policy.\n\nThis is much more likely in the case of Greece than, say, in the case of Syria, as it is an issue that strikes a powerful chord with Kemalist voters. Turkish citizens “bite” when it comes to matters of security and Erdogan wants people talking about anything but the economy. A crisis with Greece would be big enough to counteract the economic crisis.\n\nI am not saying that it will happen, but I believe that if Erdogan chooses to play this game, the Greece front is likely. And I also believe that Erdogan is even prepared to sacrifice relations with the West just to win this election. He’s willing to risk everything. The question is whether it will work. This will depend on the opposition’s ability to react. So far, it has been quite passive on several issues.\n\nErdogan may challenge the process if he loses the election, but I think this will only happen if the margin is small. This election will be a test of whether Turkey remains on the democratic path. The question is who the opposition puts forward.\n\nIf the opposition wins, things will only be marginally better in terms of Greece. Turkey’s foreign policy towards Greece is something Turkish society agrees with. We even see Kemalists adopting an extreme stance towards Greece. The different is that the Kemalists will not manipulate public opinion to such a great extent on this issue. Structurally, though, we should not expect any significant change. The disputes with Greece are an obsession in Turkey.\n\nGokhan Bacik, Palacky University, Czech Republic, expert on Islam and Turkey.\n\n* This opinion piece is part of an in-depth look by 10 analysts, journalists and experts into Turkey ahead of the June 2023 elections: Where will Turkey be a year from now?",
    "Greece raising a 'wall of lies' on migrant pushbacks": "Greece has erected a \"wall of lies\" to deny it is systematically forcing migrants back over its borders, with the tolerance of the European Union's border agency Frontex, a group of Green Members of the European Parliament said Tuesday.\n\nThe conservative government in Athens \"is trying to build a different reality\" and raising a \"wall of lies\", German MEP Erik Marquardt told a news conference ahead of a meeting with Greek Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi.\n\nGreece has for years denied allegations of systematic, illegal border pushbacks, despite extensive testimony from alleged victims to media and rights groups.\n\nIn June, Athens rejected a United Nations report claiming that its border forces had illegally repelled thousands of asylum seekers over the past two years.\n\nBut Dutch Greens MEP Tineke Strik on Tuesday insisted pushbacks are \"happening on a systematic scale.\"\n\n\"We have numerous reports from credible sources,\" Strik said.\n\nThe delegation, which included Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield of France and Belgium's Saskia Bricmont, also said European Union border agency Frontex was staying out of areas where pushbacks are believed to take place.\n\n\"They operate under the command of the Greek authorities. And the Greek authorities decide where (Frontex is) to be operational,\" Strik said.\n\n\"But if there are allegations that are very credible, that in certain areas pushbacks are taking place, why don't you demand to go and have a look?\" she said.\n\nThe group also argued that the European Commission already had the necessary information to initiate infringement procedures on pushbacks against Greece and Croatia.\n\nThe EU's executive arm \"knows what is going on\" and is taking a \"deliberate decision\" not to take further action, Strik said.\n\nThe Greens on Tuesday launched an EU-wide petition, calling on the European Commission to \"freeze funds to countries that are performing pushbacks and make the new migration funds conditional (on) human rights compliance.\"",
    "Greece’s organic food products could compete in markets abroad, minister says": "A national funding plan to support organic production worth 705 million euros will benefit over 60,000 producers and livestock farmers, Agricultural Development & Food Minister Giorgos Georgantas said on the sidelines of SerExpo Fair in northern Greece.\n\nGeorgantas was speaking at a meeting on organic foods (known as “biological foods” in Greek) held by the ministry’s Secretariat General of EU Resources and Infrastructure and the Chamber of Serres.\n\nThe minister said that of the 705 million euros, 305 million euros was earmarked for organic livestock farming, he added. “The biodiversity of Greek soil has produced Greek meat that is unique in taste and quality, anyway – it would be wrong not to support the development of organic livestock farming,” he underlined. Greece is in a position to adapt its production to European Union targets for organic produce and would have a competitive edge with its organic products abroad as well.\n\nOrganic fish cultivation also offers similar prospects, Georgantas further said, especially if linked to tourism. The ministries of Agriculture and Education, he suggested, could develop programs to promote organic production nationally, building the consumer generation of the 2030s.\n\nThe expo is taking place in Serres from September 21 to 25.\n\nThanks for reading Hellenic News of America Subscribe to HNA\n\nSOURCE; ANA-MPA",

    "Swedish Market Shows High Demand for Greece this Fall": "The Swedish market will be supporting Greek tourism into autumn with a particular interest in sports-related holidays, said Tourism Minister Vassilis Kikilias after his visit to Stockholm.\n\nThe visit comes after similar stopovers in Vienna, Berlin and Paris, and included meetings with the Association of Swedish Travel Agents and Tour Operators, executives from major tour operators specializing in the Nordic market such as Apollo, Nordic Leisure Travel Group, Orient Tours, Air Tours, SAS and Eurowings airline executives, as well as with representatives from the Swedish Association for Senior Citizens.\n\nDuring his meetings, Kikilias referred to efforts being made to extend the tourism season and incentives in this direction. He reiterated his call on older travelers to spend the winter in Greece, and underlined the importance of the Scandinavian market which is mostly oriented towards alternative tourism activities and destinations.\n\nLocal tour operators said flights to Greece reached 97 percent capacity this year, while Eurowings reported a 30 percent increase in flights from all Northern European markets compared to 2019.\n\nThe minister went on to add that the Scandinavian market has expressed interest in off season tourism mainly through thematic packages concerning golf, hiking and cycling on Crete, Rhodes, in the Peloponnese and Epirus.\n\n“We understood in our meetings that there was an interest in new investments in the hotel industry in relation to sports tourism,” he said.\n\nSpeaking later to the Greek press, Kikilias expressed his satisfaction with the feedback from his trips.\n\n“The first messages are particularly positive from Berlin and Vienna as well as from Paris and Stockholm, where I had a series of contacts with my counterparts, heads of major airlines and the most important travel operators,” said Kikilias, adding that travel packages for Greece are “almost fully booked until October, while the interest is strong for the winter as well, with many airlines having already extended their itineraries in the coming months”.\n\nHe went on to add that the ministry’s top priority is to keep tourists coming to different parts of the country all year long which will be promoted in an upcoming co-advertising campaign organized in collaboration with the Greek National Tourism Organization (GNTO), tour operators and airlines.\n\nFollowto keep up to date with all the latest on tourism and travel in Greece.",

    "Greece’s 2023 draft budget foresees lower taxes, extends lower VAT to more items, services": "Greece’s draft state budget for 2023 is expected to be finalized this coming week, before its tabling in Parliament on October 3.\n\nBasic features include lower taxes for citizens, particularly for pensioners and civil servants, by abolishing of a solidarity tax, and increases in salaries. The revenues lost will be replaced exclusively by the growing economy and control of tax evasion.\n\nThe draft budget also foresees a primary deficit, but its estimate will not be finalized until the European Union decides on whether to continue with an escape clause, due to high inflation and large fiscal necessities of supporting society.\n\nFinance Ministry sources said the government needs to balance the need to support citizens with the need to appear fiscally responsible to international markets, as its goal is to become investment-grade within 2023.\n\nRecent statements by Finance Minister Christos Staikouras revealed that the GDP will increase by 5.3% this year (from 3.1% foreseen in the budget), against 3.1% of the EU average, while the economy’s growth will settle at 2.1% for 2023 against the EU average of 0.9%.\n\nThe total of interventions announced by Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis at the annual Thessaloniki International Fair that took place this month is 3.2 billion euros.\n\nThis includes abolishing a solidarity tax on all revenues as of January 1, 2023 (1.24 billion euros); raising main pensions of 1.5 million pensioners by 6% (at least 600 mln euros); tax cuts for businesses hiring more full-time people for at least 3 months (introduced already on Sept. 1); a 50% in subsidies for student housing; extending low VAT to transport, coffee, non-alcoholic beverages, gyms, dance schools, films and tourism packages to June 2023 (246 mln euros); and continuing, if circumstances allow, the subsidisy of heating oil by about 0.25 euro/liter into 2023, beyond its current expiration at the end of 2022.\n\nThanks for reading Hellenic News of America Subscribe to HNA\n\nSOURCE; ANA-MPA"
