    "Chile: Improve productivity, social protection and boost revenues for a sustainable recovery, says OECD": "23/09/2022 - Chile has achieved an impressive recovery from the COVID-19 crisis, but the pandemic has hampered past progress in reducing poverty and social disparities.\n\n\n\n\n\nChile needs structural reforms to boost productivity, social protection and tax revenues, while tackling short-term challenges such as high inflation, according to a new OECD report.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latest OECD Economic Survey of Chile welcomes progress on significant reforms including a universal basic pension and plans for a fairer tax system which can generate higher revenues. Measures to drive higher productivity, improve competitiveness, get more Chileans into quality jobs and to improve social protection coverage should also be a priority, the Survey says.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Chile is taking important steps towards strengthening its tax base and is closing gaps in social protection,” OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann said, presenting the Survey in Santiago alongside Minister of Finance Mario Marcel. “Complementary reforms to raise productivity and investment would help to generate stronger growth, more jobs and deliver additional income to enable Chile to invest further in economic and social progress.”\n\n\n\n\n\nChile’s solid institutions and prudent management of public finances enabled a strong fiscal response to the pandemic and a vigorous recovery. The Chilean economy grew by 11.9% in 2021, far outpacing OECD and regional peers. The Survey projects growth slowing to 1.9% in 2022 as global growth slows and inflation, now at a 30-year high, curtails purchasing power. Thanks to a swift monetary policy response, inflation should return to target in early 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nChile’s tax revenues at just 21% of GDP are very low by international standards, with close to a third of the workforce in informal jobs with only a fifth of Chileans paying personal income tax. The Survey welcomes a planned reform which would bring the tax intake closer to the Latin American and OECD averages of 28% and 34% respectively. Greater tax revenues would help strengthen the resilience of public finances and importantly help finance rising social needs.\n\n\n\n\n\nChile’s longer-term growth outlook will depend on its ability to address structural growth bottlenecks including weak competition and low investment in research and development to promote innovation.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter many years of convergence, Chile’s income and productivity gap to advanced economies is again widening. The Survey recommends simplifying cumbersome regulations and licensing procedures which hold back new firm entry and investment, increasing investment in new technologies and expanding access to high-quality education.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is also scope to diversify Chile’s exports, still dominated by the mining industry, and to improve trade facilitation and the efficiency of border procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\nChile has one of Latin America’s most comprehensive social protection systems, but the pandemic highlighted gaps in coverage, particularly for informal workers. Enhancing social protection coverage for all, including via pensions, access to health services and basic income support, can help to reduce these gaps. The Survey recommends raising pension levels while applying progressive contribution rates and unifying social assistance programmes to achieve a wider coverage. Future social benefit reforms should also pay particular attention to how they affect the incentives for creating formal jobs.\n\n\n\n\n\nChile is making significant progress on sustainable energy, with renewable sources now accounting for 47% of electricity generation as solar and wind energy have gained importance. Looking ahead, Chile has a much higher potential in renewable energy generation, far exceeding domestic needs.\n\nSee an overview of the Survey with key findings, charts and summaries in English and Spanish (this link can be included in media articles)\n\nFor further information, journalists are invited to contact Catherine Bremer in the OECD Media Office (+33 1 45 24 80 97).\n\nWorking with over 100 countries, the OECD is a global policy forum that promotes policies to preserve individual liberty and improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.",

    "In Chile's desert lie vast reserves of lithium — key for electric car batteries": "ATACAMA DESERT, Chile — In the middle of the desert in northern Chile, massive pools of Caribbean blue water sit next to what appear to be snowdrifts.\n\nBut this is a lithium mine.\n\nThe pools are filled with salty groundwater that contains lithium. It's a key component in the rechargeable lithium-ion batteries for electric cars, solar panels and other green technologies.\n\n\"It's really, really a beautiful place,\" says Marcelo Valdebenito, a public relations officer for Albemarle Corp., the Charlotte, N.C.-based chemical company that operates the mine. \"This is the lithium that powers the world.\"\n\nIndeed, the world is hungry for the silvery-white metal. The International Energy Agency is projecting a more than 40-fold increase in demand for lithium by 2040. Lithium prices have hit record highs this year.\n\nDespite growing concerns about the environmental impact of lithium extraction, skyrocketing demand is good news for mining companies in Chile. The South American country is the second-largest lithium producer after Australia. And Argentina, Bolivia and Chile are known as the \"lithium triangle,\" together holding more than half of the world's proven lithium reserves.\n\nAnnual production at the Albemarle mine has increased from 22,000 tons to 84,000 tons since 2016, says Ignacio Mehech, the company's country manager in Chile.\n\n\"We are growing as the demand is growing and today we are a much bigger company,\" Mehech told NPR, adding that the company now has 1,000 employees in Chile, up from 250 five years ago.\n\nSouth America could power up\n\nEven so, the region's lithium output is just a fraction of what it could be, leading to fears of an eventual bottleneck in world supplies.\n\nBolivian President Luis Arce has pledged to make his country \"the world capital of lithium\" and supply 40% of global demand for the metal by 2030. But due to technological challenges and community resistance, as well as heavy state intervention in the economy, the industry has been slow to develop. Production in Bolivia remains negligible.\n\nEconomic turmoil has kept Argentina from opening more mines.\n\nMeanwhile, Chile has high taxes and strict mining regulations, says Mehech. The red tape for production permits involves securing approval from the nation's nuclear energy commission since the metal can be used in nuclear power and weapons.\n\n\"It is very difficult and that's why you don't see more lithium companies in Chile,\" Mehech says of Albemarle, which he says is one of just two companies producing lithium in Chile.\n\nMining raises environmental concerns\n\nBut some Chileans prefer a go-slow approach.\n\nThey include microbiologist Cristina Dorador, who has spent years studying the salt flats of the Atacama Desert. She says lithium mines extract huge amounts of groundwater. Ten-times saltier than seawater, this brine is then placed in enormous evaporation pools. After 18 months, the resulting 6% lithium solution is then turned into a white lithium powder and exported for use in batteries.\n\nDorador says removing so much groundwater will inevitably make the Atacama Desert — home to Chile's lithium mines — hotter and drier. She recently co-authored an investigation linking lithium mining to an 11% reduction in the local flamingo population over the past decade.\n\n\"With so much pressure from the world to produce more lithium,\" she says, \"the price is going to be paid by Chile's environment.\"\n\nWhy not make the batteries, too?\n\nAnother critic is Andrés Díaz, who directs the Center for Energy and Sustainable Development at Diego Portales University in Santiago, the Chilean capital. Instead of just lithium, he thinks Chile should produce and export higher-valued lithium-ion batteries that the country currently imports from Asia at a steep cost.\n\nTo move in that direction, Albemarle signed an agreement with the Chilean government to spend $300 million on research and development here by 2043.\n\n\"For us, it doesn't make any sense to export lithium and then buy from other countries batteries with a material that we produced at the very beginning,\" Díaz says.\n\nMehech acknowledges that lithium mining uses a lot of groundwater but claims the tradeoff is worth it. He points out that the amount of water required to produce enough lithium for an electric car battery is about the same amount needed to produce a half pound of beef or 11 avocados.\n\nThe avocados, he says, will last for just a few days, \"but a lithium battery lasts for 10 years and then you can recycle it.\"\n\nCopyright 2022 NPR.

    "Blog: Chile's Boric wasted an opportunity for Palestine at the UN General Assembly": "Chilean President Gabriel Boric may currently be the most outspoken leader in Latin America on Palestinian rights and Israeli violations. However, his rhetoric leaves much to be desired. It, in turn, raises questions about how Chile – the country with the largest Palestinian community in the region – can differentiate itself from other countries to become a model to follow, rather than following international consensus over the two-state compromise and Israel's security narrative.\n\nIn his first address to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), Boric spoke about Palestine's right to freedom and sovereignty while mangling his message by including a false equivalence with Israel that eliminates the colonial context. \"[Palestinian people] should yield to their inalienable right to establish their own free and sovereign state. In the same way, [let's] guarantee Israel's legitimate right to live within secure and internationally recognised borders,\" Boric asserted.\n\nBoric's speech was pronounced \"politically correct\", while noting that Chile's stance has always advocated for the recognition of Palestinian people's rights and Israel's rights while promoting the two-state compromise, like the rest of the international community. In which case, Boric's activist stances as president are unlikely to leave any impact on Chilean diplomacy. Under Boric, the Chilean government is advocating for the same stance that his predecessor Sebastian Pinera adhered to, which is a bonus for Israel, despite the grievances Israeli media aired upon Boric's electoral victory.\n\nREAD: The EU should stop exploiting Palestinian NGOs\n\nDays before his UNGA speech, Boric postponed accepting the credentials of the new Israeli ambassador to Chile, Gil Artzyeli, in response to the Israeli forces' killing of 17-year-old Palestinian Odai Trad Salah in Kufr Dan near Jenin. However, his stance, which made headline news in major media outlets worldwide, was diminished by the UNGA speech that attempted equivalence between the coloniser and the colonised while simplifying, to the point of obliteration, the reason why Palestinians are deprived of a state, possibly permanently.\n\nBoric is not unaware of the Palestinian plight as a result of Zionist colonisation. Neither is he oblivious to the fact that Palestinians and the indigenous people of Chile – the Mapuche – have suffered similar forms of aggression because of governments criminalising their struggle for land reclamation and political autonomy. Yet, it is possible that, as president, Boric's activist stances will be mellowed by diplomatic requirements, such as abiding by the two-state compromise, which has failed Palestinians and become defunct in all but international rhetoric.\n\nPrior to the presidency, Boric stood out as one of the most vocal activists in Chile. As president, Boric is navigating a complex reality that includes the legacy of Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship and ties to Israel during that period, as well as the country's reliance on securing military and surveillance equipment from Palestine's oppressors.\n\nTo cast Israel and legitimacy together is an aberration, particularly when using such descriptions to balance advocating for Palestinian rights. Boric wasted an opportunity at his first UNGA speech to call out Israel's colonial violence and how it invalidates legitimacy. It is not up to the international community to guarantee Israel's existence, but Boric knows that Chile can play a pivotal role in ensuring that the international community gravitates towards the legitimacy of the Palestinian people's political demands.\n\nREAD: Chile President refuses Israeli ambassador's credentials over Israel's killing of Palestinians\n\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Monitor.",

Now, pollsters are not the only ones soul-searching. The dramatic result has prompted public reflections and mea culpas among many of the draft charter’s proponents.\n\nPresident Gabriel Boric, an early advocate, swapped out five cabinet ministers only six months into his presidency—generally replacing younger, far-left confidants with older, center-left politicians in an apparent acknowledgement that Chilean voters found the proposed constitution too radical. The rewrite aimed to move Chile away from the small-government economic model enshrined in its current charter, written in 1980 under dictator Augusto Pinochet.\n\nWhile Chileans wanted change, the draft introduced “change to the extreme,” Lucas Perelló and Will Freeman wrote in Foreign Policy last week. The document would have been one of the world’s most progressive constitutions, paving the way for stronger protections for Indigenous Chileans, the environment, and women—including almost certainly legalizing abortion. It would have also upped the state’s obligations to provide social goods such as health care and housing.\n\nThe proposed constitution’s rejection “is the first big political failure of my generation,” tweeted economist Noam Titelman, one of the co-founders of Boric’s far-left Frente Amplio movement.\n\nBoric’s cohort of millennial activists-turned-politicians first gained national attention during 2011 student protests calling for education reform. Many went on to enter Congress, where they successfully channeled the popular discontent behind massive anti-government protests in 2019 into an agreement with former conservative President Sebastián Piñera to allow a constitutional rewrite.\n\nIn a 2020 referendum, 78 percent of Chileans approved the measure, and, in May 2021, the country elected a constitutional assembly to draft the new charter that was heavy on left-wing activists and political outsiders—far more so than Chile’s legislature. Boric’s election as president late last year was yet another step forward in his cohort’s push for progressive change through established institutions.\n\nThe draft constitution’s approval would have been an even bigger accomplishment. But Perelló and Freeman note that its defeat is not necessarily an endorsement of the current dictatorship-era constitution. The authors cite a July poll showing that 74 percent of Chileans supported a new constitutional redrafting process in the event of the document’s rejection—which Chile’s Congress is now debating whether and how to authorize.\n\nA new process would almost certainly be guided by a more centrist group of authors than those chosen in 2021. Writing in Nueva Sociedad on Sunday, Titelman reflected on where the rejected constitution’s architects went wrong. He argued that the independent and left-wing figures elected to the constitutional assembly did not sufficiently embrace compromises and consensus-building with its more conservative members. Instead, they opted for “maximalist” positions even when they did not have the votes to approve them.\n\nAssembly member Patricio Fernández, a journalist who ran for the assembly as an independent candidate, made a similar comment to El Mostrador en La Clave Radio. Inside the assembly, the Frente Amplio “lacked leadership” by failing to reach across the political aisle. “I’m sure that if there was a wider majority constructed inside the assembly,” he added, the public would have viewed contentious topics like Indigenous rights differently.\n\nRosa Catrileo, herself an Indigenous Mapuche assembly member, also cited poor communication as an obstacle to the proposed constitution’s approval. Even though the draft included ambitious measures designed to protect Indigenous groups, Catrileo told CNN Chile that some members of her own community were skeptical of it, instead believing disinformation that circulated online—such as the false claim that expanded housing rights meant the government would confiscate private property.\n\nSome critics also said that sitting Congress members should have played a role in the assembly to ensure the draft’s provisions could be more easily translated into legislation. The rejected charter, for example, included 388 articles and hard-to-interpret redesigns for the Senate and judiciary, which provoked uncertainty among the public. Gabriela Lotta, a Brazilian political scientist, tweeted that the Chilean drafting process should give Brazilians renewed pride in their own 1988 constitution, which was created by lawmakers with substantial input from civil society and enshrined broad social rights.\n\nStill, she said, “I think Chile emerges strengthened from this process.”\n\nIn the likely next round of writing, some elements of the previous drafting process are expected to endure, such as the requirement that government bodies be gender-balanced, journalist Daniel Matamala wrote for La Tercera. Politicians who campaigned for the draft to be rejected have called on different occasions for its focus on climate change and its focus on shoring up social rights to remain in a future iteration.\n\nChile should weigh the lessons of its plebiscite carefully, Matamala wrote after the vote. “We already wasted one opportunity. Maybe the next one will be the last.”\n\nUpcoming Events\n\nThursday, Sept. 15: The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee holds hearing on U.S. policy toward Venezuela.\n\nSaturday, Sept. 24: Brazil’s presidential candidates participate in a televised debate.\n\nMonday, Sept. 26: The U.N. Human Rights Council discusses Venezuela.\n\nWhat We’re Following\n\nArgentina’s assassination attempt. A Brazilian man and his Argentine girlfriend have been arrested after the man tried to assassinate Argentine Vice President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner in Buenos Aires last week. The man pulled the trigger of a gun at short rage at Fernández de Kirchner’s head outside of her house, but it did not fire.\n\nArgentine investigators say they believe the attack involved previous planning by the couple, but they did not immediately announce evidence of a wider plot against the vice president. Still, the attempt remains another symptom of dangerously high political temperatures in Latin America. The detained man had spoken out against Kirchner’s leftist policies on Argentine television and had a neo-Nazi symbol tattooed on his elbow.\n\nThe would-be assassin’s gun may have jammed because it was old; if he had had access to a newer firearm, the story could have turned out very differently. Unlike neighboring Brazil, where President Jair Bolsonaro was stabbed during his last campaign in 2018—and where more than 45 politicians were killed in the first six months of this year alone—Argentina does not have a recent history of high-level political assassination attempts. That is, until now.\n\nUkraine-sized refugee flow. Flows of Venezuelan migrants fleeing the country’s economic and political meltdown temporarily abated during the coronavirus pandemic. Now, the number has begun to rise again. A total of 6.8 million Venezuelans have left the country since 2014, receiving countries reported.\n\nThat’s around the size of the current Ukrainian refugee crisis. But Venezuelans have received far less support from international donors than their Ukrainian counterparts. By last week, United Nations member states had only pledged 13 percent of the funding the U.N. tried to raise in late 2021.\n\n“There’s real donor fatigue,” Refugees International’s Rachel Schmidtke’s told FP’s Robbie Gramer.\n\nWhile international donations lag, it is neighboring Latin American countries that continue to do the heavy lifting when it comes to receiving Venezuelan migrants. Ecuador, for its part, has just kicked off what will be a yearlong process of granting regular status to over 300,000 Venezuelans on its soil.\n\nA participant grills meat during the Barbecue Federal Championship, in which representatives of different Argentine provinces compete, in Buenos Aires on Aug. 14.\n\nRoasted pride. Argentines experienced a rare moment of national unity this week in outrage over their country’s 51st-place performance at an international barbecue competition in Belgium.\n\nThe South American agricultural powerhouse prides itself on its grilling prowess. But the Argentine team was thrown off by the technical constraints of the contest, its team director told La Nación, including a requirement to use an egg-shaped Japanese-style meat smoker instead of cooking over an open fire.\n\n“Argentina was taken out of its comfort zone,” the president of the Argentine Federation of Barbecuers told the newspaper. He added that judges paid serious attention to each team’s desserts and side dishes, while the Argentine team’s specialty was meat.\n\nThat excuse was not good enough for online commentators. Some tore apart a published image of one of Argentina’s dishes, criticizing it as “an aberration,” ugly, and, similar-looking to an alien in the science fiction film District 9.\n\nMusician Rosendo Faulkner speculated on Twitter that the problem could have been the haute cuisine background of the Argentine chefs, several of whom work in restaurants in Europe. “When I’m president, anyone who represents Argentina in the Barbecue World Cup will have to have worked at least two construction jobs,” he said.\n\nQuestion of the Week\n\nWhich of the following is not a typical ingredient in Argentine chimichurri sauce, used to accompany steaks?

They occurred Wednesday, the 200th anniversary of Brazil’s split from Portugal.\n\nBolsonaro made speeches to attendees of bicentennial events in both Rio de Janeiro and Brasília, encouraging audiences to vote for him and attacking his political opponents against a backdrop of military parades and airplane flyovers—all broadcast at length on state television. Experts in Brazilian election law told newspaper Valor Econômico that the president violated a ban on using government resources for his own campaign, and opposition parties have filed complaints with election authorities.\n\nIn the meantime, Bolsonaro got the images of packed crowds he sought, as tens of thousands of demonstrators turned out in Brasília, Rio, and other cities where he did not personally appear, such as São Paulo.\n\nForeign Policy spoke to attendees of the Rio de Janeiro demonstration, who repeated Bolsonaro’s unsubstantiated claims that Brazil’s electronic voting machines are unreliable and that he is leading in the polls. The mainstream media “is lying” about the election, and any potential arbitration by Brazil’s Supreme Court “cannot be trusted,” retiree Fátima Barbosa said. Bolsonaro supporters who addressed the crowds from atop trucks lining Copacabana beach repeated similar messages.\n\nBarbosa said that if the voting machines show a victory for Bolsonaro’s election opponent, former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, in October, she plans to attend any protest Bolsonaro calls for to object to the results. Nurse technician Roberta Rocha, also at the event, said that if the voting machines show a Lula victory, Brazil’s Army “will demand a recount,” and that courts cannot stop them because “the Army is a greater force, and it is with Bolsonaro.”\n\nThis kind of widespread narrative suggests the high tensions surrounding the election won’t end when the votes are counted—not least because Bolsonaro’s supporters have embraced his new permissions for civilian gun ownership.\n\nSpeaking to a crowd of tens of thousands in Rio on Wednesday, the president said that leftists “should be wiped out of public life.”",

    "‘My Imaginary Country’ Review: Chile in Revolt": "The most powerful images in “My Imaginary Country” are of the demonstrations in the streets of Santiago, Chile, that began in October 2019. Hundreds of thousands of Chileans took to the streets, at first to protest a subway fare increase, and eventually to demand sweeping changes to the nation’s economic and political order. They were met with tear gas, baton charges and plastic bullets aimed at their eyes. Some fought back with cobblestones chiseled from the street, which they hurled at the police.\n\nTo watch scenes like that in a documentary film — or, for that matter, on social media — is to experience a strong sense of déjà vu. What happened in Santiago in 2019 and 2020 feels like an echo of similar uprisings around the world; in Tehran in 2009 (and again this week); in Arab capitals like Tunis, Damascus and Cairo in 2011; in Kyiv in 2014; in Paris at the height of the Yellow Vest movement in 2018. Those episodes aren’t identical, but each represents the eruption of long-simmering dissatisfaction with a status quo that seems stubbornly indifferent to the grievances of the people.\n\nAccompanying the exhilaration that these pictures might bring is a sense of foreboding. In almost every case, these rebellions ended in defeat, disappointment, stalemate or worse. The buoyant democratic promise of Tahrir Square in Cairo has been smothered by a decade of military dictatorship. Ukrainian democracy, seemingly victorious after the Maidan “revolution of dignity,” has since faced internal and external threats, most recently from Vladimir Putin’s army.",
    "Chile baloney": "What a lot of baloney Will Lilley writes in saying Allende ‘brought it upon himself’ when he was overthrown in a military coup by the brutal General Pinochet, backed by Henry Kissinger and the CIA in Chile, 1973.\n\nAllende was the first socialist president to be elected democratically through the ballot box in South America. That is, he and his colleagues played the game of the ruling class, the colonial powers of the US, France, the UK, and Australia. And won the election fair and square. Thisy represented the expressed ardent desire of the majority of the Chilean people to distribute the wealth of their country much more fairly amongst the people. That did not sit well with the wealthy elite and American corporations used to ripping off Chile. So they backed Pinochet and the CIA’s coup against Allende. The ‘communistas’ had to be destroyed, rooted out like they were vermin, for fear Allende’s example, like the Sandinista revolution and ‘Poder Popular’ (People Power) in Nicaragua a decade later, would spread to other impoverished nations of South and Central America, and other poor nations of the world.\n\nI was in Chile making a film in 1985 and I had firsthand experience of the murderous nature of Pinochet’s secret police who detained and tortured; they even used Alsatian dogs trained to rape women political prisoners. After the coup in ’73, Pinochet and his feared secret police rounded up ‘leftists’ like me (and many others in our Byron community) and tortured and ‘disappeared’ them. These were artists, writers, journalists, Montessori school teachers, architects, actors, and musicians who dared to want a better world for themselves and their kids. The murdered ‘leftists’ children, like the Stolen Generation here, were adopted out to childless Chilean army officers and the wealthy elite, never told who their real parents were.\n\nWill Lilley, in the ‘democracy’ (!) we live with here in Australia, you are free to peddle your sympathies for murderous fascists like Pinochet, Kissinger, Soeharto in Murdoch’s rags – he’ll believe you. He’s part of the mega-rich and ruling elite of the world.

    "‘It’s a miracle’: Gran Abuelo in Chile could be world’s oldest living tree": "In a secluded valley in southern Chile, a lone alerce tree stands above the canopy of an ancient forest.\n\nGreen shoots sprout from the crevices in its thick, dark trunks, huddled like the pipes of a great cathedral organ, and water streams down its lichen-streaked bark on to the forest floor from bulbous knots in the wood.\n\n“It was like a waterfall of green, a great presence before me,” remembers the climate scientist Jonathan Barichivich, 41, of the first time he encountered the Gran Abuelo, or “great-grandfather”, tree as a child.\n\nBarichivich grew up in Alerce Costero national park, 500 miles (800km) south of the capital, Santiago. It is home to hundreds of alerces, Fitzroya cupressoides, slow-growing conifers native to the cold, wet valleys of the southern Andes.\n\n“I never thought about how old the Gran Abuelo could be,” he said. “Records don’t really interest me.” However, Barichivich’s groundbreaking study has shown the 100ft (30-metre) giant could be the world’s oldest living tree.\n\nIn January 2020, he visited the Gran Abuelo with his mentor and friend, the dendrochronologist Antonio Lara, to take a core sample from the trunk.\n\nThey were able to reach only 40% into the tree as its centre is likely to be rotten, making a complete core unattainable. Yet that sample yielded a finding of about 2,400 years.\n\nUndeterred, Barichivich set about devising a model that could estimate the Gran Abuelo’s age. Taking the known ages of other alerces in the forest and factoring in climate and natural variation, he calibrated a model that simulated a range of possible ages, producing an astounding estimate of 5,484 years old.\n\nThat would make it more than six centuries senior to Methuselah, a bristlecone pine in eastern California recognised as the world’s oldest non-clonal tree – a plant that does not share a common root system. Some clonal trees live longer, such as Sweden’s Old Tjikko, a Norway spruce thought to be 9,558 years old.\n\nBarichivich takes a core sample from a tree stump. Photograph: Salomón Henríquez\n\nBarichivich believes there is an 80% chance the tree has lived for more than 5,000 years – but some colleagues have poured scorn on the findings. They assert that complete, countable tree ring cores are the only true way of determining age.\n\nThe climate scientist hopes to publish his research early next year. He will continue to refine his model but waves away the “colonialism” present in the field.\n\nThe Gran Abuelo isn’t just old, it’s a time capsule with a message about the future Jonathan Barichivich\n\n“Some colleagues are sceptical and cannot understand why we have revealed the finding before formally publishing it,” he said. “But this is post-normal science. We have very little time to act – we cannot wait one or two years, it could already be too late.”\n\nBarichivich believes ancient trees may help experts understand how forests interact with the climate.\n\n“The Gran Abuelo isn’t just old, it’s a time capsule with a message about the future,” he said. “We have a 5,000-year record of life in this tree alone, and we can see the response of an ancient being to the changes we have made to the planet.”\n\nIn January, Barichivich, who works at the Laboratory for Climate and Environment Sciences and Environment in Paris, won a €1.5m European Research Council starting grant he describes as the “holy grail” for a scientist.\n\n\n\nHe has embarked on a five-year project to assess the future capacity of forests to capture carbon, hoping to add tree-ring data from thousands of sites around the world into climate simulations for the first time.\n\n\n\nMore than a third of the planet’s vegetated surface is covered by forests, capturing carbon dioxide during photosynthesis, but current models are only able to make estimates for 20 or 30 years into the future.\n\n\n\nBy adding data for xylogenesis, the formation of wood, Barichivich believes he could provide 100-year predictions for climate change – and revolutionise our ability to understand and mitigate its effects.\n\n“If tree rings are a book, then for 40 years everyone’s just been looking at the cover,” he said.\n\n‘Bit by bit, the tree is dying’\n\nBarichivich poses with Gran Abuelo. The climate scientist has embarked on a five-year project to assess the future capacity of forests to capture carbon. Photograph: Salomón Henríquez/the Guardian\n\nIn an office surrounded by varnished samples, fragile cores and wood shavings, Barichivich’s mentor Antonio Lara, 66, has spent his career working to reconstruct temperature, precipitation and watershed levels throughout history.\n\n\n\nLara, a professor at the Faculty of Forest Sciences and Natural Resources at Chile’s Austral University in the southern city of Valdivia, has been able to prove that alerces can absorb carbon from the atmosphere and trap it for between 1,500 and 2,000 years in standing dead trees. Buried alerce trunks can hold carbon for more than 4,000 years.\n\nHe has also pinpointed exact climatic events by translating tree rings into numbers, which can then be read like a barcode. “The great-grandfather tree is a miracle for three reasons – that it grew, that it survived, and then that it was found by Jonathan’s grandfather,” Lara said.\n\n\n\nIn the mid-1940s, Barichivich’s grandfather, Aníbal Henríquez, arrived from the southern city of Lautaro to work for the forestry companies felling the lahuan, as the alerces are known in the Indigenous language Mapudungun, his native tongue.\n\nHe went on to become the park’s first warden, but many giant alerce trees had already fallen victim to loggers before Chile made it illegal to cut them down in 1976.\n\nAlerce shingle was used as currency by local populations throughout the 1700s and 1800s and the wood was commonly used in construction. The famous Unesco-protected wooden churches on the island of Chiloé are built from alerce trunks.\n\n\n\nHenríquez happened upon Gran Abuelo while out on a patrol in the early 1970s. Although he was reluctant to disclose the find at first, word soon got out and people began to arrive: now, more than 10,000 tourists trek down to the small wooden viewing platform next to the tree each summer.\n\nAlerce shingle was used as currency by local populations throughout the 1700s and 1800s. Photograph: Krystyna Szulecka Photography/Alamy\n\nOther alerces in the valley fell victim to loggers or forest fires, leaving the gnarled tree standing alone. “Bit by bit, the tree is dying,” said Marcelo Delgado, Barichivich’s cousin who works in the park as one of five full-time rangers. “People jump down from the platform to peel off bark to take as a souvenir.”\n\n\n\nFootfall around the base of the tree has also damaged the thin layer of bark on its roots, affecting nutrient uptake. After 29 other trees were vandalised by tourists, Chile’s national forestry corporation, which manages the country’s national parks, closed the trail indefinitely.\n\n\n\nBarichivich hopes that by showing that Gran Abuelo is the world’s oldest tree, he could raise the alarm about the urgency with which we must protect the natural world. While the scope of his research is far broader, Barichivich insists the national park in which he grew up is where he belongs.\n\n\n\nWhen he was eight years old, his grandfather disappeared on a routine patrol out in the snow. His body was found two days later. Another uncle, also a park ranger, later died in the park.\n\n\n\n“It seems like it’s a family tradition,” Barichivich said. “The same fate probably awaits me, dying with my boots on out in the forest. But first I want to unlock its secrets.”",

    "‘Only Way Out Is Emancipation’: Mapuche Ponder Future As Chile Rejects Constitution": "The Latin American Left is regrouping. On July 19, 2021, Peru’s National Elections Jury announced the official results of the 2021 presidential elections, declaring Pedro Castillo as President of Peru. An important voting survey in Brazil has revealed that Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva would outperform neo-fascist President Jair Bolsonaro in all scenarios for the 2022 elections in the country. Colombia is in socio-economic turmoil, creating a potential opening for the election of Gustavo Petro – a left-wing politician. In Chile, the result of elections held on May 15-16, 2021, for the 155-member new constituent assembly has thrust progressive candidates to the forefront of national politics. All these dynamics will regionally strengthen the leftist governments already in power in Argentina, Bolivia, Cuba, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. An anti-neoliberal shift in Latin America’s political compass carries global significance.\n\nImperialism\n\n\n\nLarge swathes of humanity who live in the peripheries of the world system have been witnessing a deadly process of absolute immiseration. Imperialism has restricted the economic growth of the periphery to mineral and agricultural sectors in order to assure raw materials for advanced capitalist nations. Hence, most Third World economies are heavily dependent on the export of primary commodities. In Latin America, such primary commodities account for the majority of exports for nearly all countries. While Latin American countries export primary goods to the Global North, they tend to re-import manufactured products from these same countries. The value added to these manufactured commodities – typically constructed from the primary inputs imported earlier – generates profit for northern countries while maintaining Latin American countries in a perpetual trade deficit.\n\nWhile some countries in the periphery have facilitated a degree of industrialization through the surpluses accumulated from export-led growth, the disarticulated structures of these economies persists. The imperialist states’ monopolies – technological, financial, natural resources, communications, and military – has meant that there has been a lack of any significant indigenous technical development. Even to the extent that industrial growth has occurred, it has been based on the import of capital and technology, which has considerably reduced the dynamic effects on the economy that are usually associated with industrial growth. Moreover, a relocation of the locus of value creation from the core to the periphery means that the core relies less and less on the unprofitable exploitation of its own workers. Instead, the metropole increasingly divides the world into what has been labeled as Southern “production economies” and Northern “consumption economies.”\n\nThe main driver behind this process is undoubtedly the low wage level in the South. Entrenchment of extroverted economies like these has generated cut-throat competition amongst Southern firms for foreign capital. What we have now is a global race to the bottom, marked by a deathly spiral of exchange rate devaluations, hyper-low taxes and depressed wages. Multinational corporations based in the capitalist core have unendingly feasted on this wretchedness, fattening their profits from the extreme exploitation of the Third World’s large labor reserves. As such, the structure of today’s global economy has been profoundly shaped by the allocation of labor to industrial sectors according to differential rates of national exploitation. Thus, only the outward form of value transfers from the South to the North has changed, with the unequal exchange of products embodying different quantities of value steadily continuing. A large pool of precarized workers has been created, which consistently remains enmeshed in networks of informal economy, being forced by the productive configurations to enrich foreign capitalists and nourish the parasitic nature of the comprador bourgeoisie.\n\nInternational Finance Capital\n\n\n\nThe continuation of the international division of labor and the creation of dependent industrialization has been complemented by the hegemony of international finance capital. Prabhat Patnaik writes:\n\n“In the current phase of imperialism, finance capital has become international, while the State remains a nation-State. The nation-State therefore willy-nilly must bow before the wishes of finance, for otherwise finance (both originating in that country and brought in from outside) will leave that particular country and move elsewhere, reducing it to illiquidity and disrupting its economy. The process of globalization of finance therefore has the effect of undermining the autonomy of the nation-State. The State cannot do what it wishes to do, or what its elected government has been elected to do, since it must do what finance wishes it to do.”\n\nThe interests of the financial oligarchy lie in strongly opposing state expenditure financed either by taxes on capitalists or by borrowing – the only ways of financing through which the state can effect a net expansion in aggregate demand. Financial interests are against deficit-financed spending for a number of reasons. First, deficit financing is seen to increase the liquidity overhang in the system, and therefore as being potentially inflationary. Inflation is anathema to finance since it erodes the value of financial assets. Second, financial markets fear that the introduction of debt-financed spending – which is driven by goals other than profit-making – will render interest rate differentials that determine financial profits more unpredictable. Third, if deficit spending leads to a substantial build-up of the state’s debt, it may intervene in financial markets to lower interest rates with implications for financial returns.\n\nUnder these circumstances, even moderate welfarism has become a danger to the neoliberal order. Whereas the welfare state in the immediate post-War era served the ruling class by warding off the threat of communism, in the neoliberal era – where accumulation by dispossession has become the predominant mode of capitalist growth – even the most modest of demand management policies have had to face intense political opposition. Taking into account the internationally polarizing and nationally suffocating results of global capitalism, the slow resurgence of the Latin American Left will provide an avenue for the advancement of an alternative agenda.\n\nThe Experience of the Pink Tide\n\nFirstly, progressive governments in the continent have always tried to tackle relations of dependency, as is discernible from their experience in power during the Pink Tide. In opposition to metropolitan control over mineral resources and plantations, the Latin American Left consolidated the public sector which displaced the dominance of foreign capital. These arrangements ensured that the revenues coming from the primary commodity sector were no longer siphoned off by the rich but were diverted towards the poor. The assertion of control over financial resources and their redirection toward social developmentalism was coupled with the uneven promotion of sovereign forms of industrialization, trade and finance through various initiatives like the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, the Union of South American Nations and the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of our America.\n\nBefore the public sector and regional groupings could be fully used for developing domestic heavy-industry base and technological capability, the commodity boom itself collapsed. This external event did not allow the Left’s redistributive strategy to transform into concerted attempts at changing the productive forces. However, the fact that a politico-ideological project of independence was advocated stands as a testimony to the fruitful possibilities contained in the Pink Tide. Industrialization, social welfare, and the nation came together in the notion of sovereignty; industrialization was not posed simply as a means by which Third World capitalists could accumulate capital more effectively, but as a means of improving the nation as a whole.\n\nMoreover, a programme of selective delinking was supported which allowed Latin American governments to self-determine which sector of the economy could be safely opened up. They could differentially open up a sector where foreign capital was needed to supplement local capital in whole or in part. As part of this blueprint of economic self-determination, clear-headed campaigns were initiated to resist pressures to liberalize the financial sector. In fact, Latin America’s leftist governments tended to increase the level of capital controls instead of merely adapting to the constraints imposed by financial globalization. The reregulation of cross-border financial flows was part of a coordinated effort to obtain further macroeconomic policy autonomy and attend to the interests of impoverished constituencies.\n\nThe existence of capital controls enabled the Latin American Left to temporarily soften the impact of the end of commodity boom. One of the visible ways that the collapse of primary commodity prices makes itself felt is through a shortage of foreign exchange to finance necessary imports. This gives rise to inflation, to currency depreciations which further aggravate inflation, and to shortages of essential goods. Further, the reduced incomes -a result of the slump in the primary commodity demand – cause recession, stagnation and unemployment. The conservation of foreign exchange for importing essential commodities, and the prevention of outflow of foreign exchange by wealth-holders hedging against exchange rate depreciation, become extremely important. Towards this end, the Latin American Left’s regulatory management of banks and foreign trade proved to be crucial in mitigating the effects of changing global conditions.\n\nSecondly, Latin American leftist governments extensively used planning and welfare policies, such as conditional cash transfers (CCTs), financed through the receipts of economic growth and the taxation of rising commodity exports. Under a new socio-economic structure of accumulation, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rates increased and social conditions improved, reversing the adverse consequences of neoliberalism and cementing popular support for the Pink Tide administrations. The GDP per capita of Latin America and the Caribbean rose by 31% between 2003 and 2013, poverty rates fell from 32 to 17%, and the country-average of the Gini index of household per capita income in Latin America fell by 0.06. All this stood in complete contrast to the past implementations of harsh austerity programs and fiscal niggardliness which were intended to restore government’s “credibility” and return to the elusive cycle of growth led solely by private investment.\n\nThe implementation of welfare policies needs to be looked in the specific context of contemporary capitalism. In a global situation marked by the hegemony of international finance capital and calcified hierarchies, the unleashing of successful poverty alleviation schemes, increase in minimum wages, strengthening of labor regulations and the weakening of deficit targets were not acceptable to the elites who saw these policies as a precursor to more radical shifts. Thus, in an era of finance capital where even the most basic welfare spending runs contrary to the interests of an inflation-fearing financial oligarchy, the Latin American Left’s fiscal expansionism and consolidation of social policies constituted a sharp attack on neoliberal interests.\n\nPresent-day fluctuations in the balance of forces in Latin America hint towards a revival of the Left. We need to comprehend these fluid tectonic plates of popular power from an actively political perspective. Building a socialist society in a Third World country, in which – despite its wealth of natural resources – there remains immense poverty and hideous inequality is a hard task. Moving against the powerful tide of reactionary forces and helping the oppressed classes to overcome social humiliation requires a long gestation period. In short, the entrance of the Global South subaltern on the stage of history is a richly textured pathway of socialized autonomy which never follows a linear or perfect course of economic reconstruction. Most of the times, the width of populist culture and depth of working class power intersect to generate a multi-sided trajectory of revolution. As Vladimir Lenin himself said, “Whoever expects a “pure” social revolution will never live to see it. Such a person pays lip-service to revolution without understanding what revolution is.” Thus, in the current conjuncture, we need to show solidarity with Latin America’s renascent Pink Tide which promises to deal a blow to imperialist capitalism.\n\nThis article first appeared in the Orinoco Tribune.",

    "Human mobility in Chile: Coordination and response of UNHCR, partners and donors during 2021 - Chile": "PROLOGUE\n\nThe last two years of the pandemic have been devastating. Border closures increased the departure of people from countries where they suffer persecution, intolerance or human rights violations. In fact, just considering Venezuela, there are already 6 million human beings who left their home in search of a safer place to restart their lives.\n\nThe risks have been dramatic. During the journey, many of them faced conditions that put their lives in check, such as extreme climates, complex geographies, in addition to human trafficking and trafficking criminal networks. In addition, the increase in xenophobia is added as an unfortunate consequence of this situation.\n\nThis scenario has challenged us to strengthen international cooperation and intensify our capacity to respond to this crisis, because poverty and inequality have increased in the region, affecting the most vulnerable people, such as refugees. Thousands of them continue to rely on humanitarian aid to eat and sleep, while access to education and health are a privilege for many families.\n\nThat is why fostering effective local integration becomes one of the biggest challenges to offer long-term solutions that guarantee health, education, housing, among other essential services for refugee and migrant people.\n\nThe world is living in complex times and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the displacement generated by the armed conflict is an unfortunate example that justifies the existence of agencies such as UNHCR to protect people. In addition to this situation that marked the beginning of 2022, in Latin America we continue to face the COVID-19 pandemic and the largest exodus in the history of our region.\n\nFor our Southern Cone region, and especially for our Regional Office covering Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay, obstacles to access to territory and refugee status determination procedures were of great concern in 2021. In this regard, UNHCR advocated to the governments to maintain entry exceptions for people in need of protection, in addition to resuming asylum procedures and implementing alternative options for refugee and migrant people to virtually register their applications or adopt remote interview modalities, among other exceptions.We also work in coordination with civil society, government human rights institutions and public defenders to ensure access in specific cases identified by the office. We made strategic progress with specialized partners who have identified cases, provided support and intervened with the authorities in order to guarantee access to territory and refugee status determination procedures.\n\nSince 2020, thanks to the impact of UNHCR, Uruguay has maintained entry exceptions to authorize access to the territory of people in need of international protection and guaranteed access to the determination of refugee status, RSD procedure, which it does not happened in the other countries. In addition, UNHCR supported the Permanent Secretariat of the National Refugee Commission (CORE) in the development of an abbreviated procedure to analyse and resolve the asylum applications of Venezuelans, which was approved and implemented. The CORE recognized 189 Venezuelan nationals during 2021.\n\nFollowing UNHCR’s advocacy and proposals, Argentina adopted a protocol for conducting remote refugee status determination interviews.In the case of Paraguay, it continued to apply a prima facie approach to Venezuelans and other nationalities, recognising 2,148 Venezuelans and 653 Cubans during 2021.And in Chile, thanks to the support of our donors and the excellent coordination work with our partners, important advances were made that you will know in the next pages.Thus, we can proudly say that the Southern Cone reached great achievements.\n\nIn 2021, together, Argentina, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay, supported more than 15,000 people with health consultations; more than 12,000 with non-food items; 5,000 people with shelter and temporary accommodation; and more than 13,500 with cash assistance. More than 21,500 people were able to obtain counselling and 28,000 were provided with legal assistance. And a particularly relevant fact for our operation: we support more than 200 victims of the scourge of gender violence. Numbers are important because they give a true dimension to the work in the territory, although even more important are the people behind the numbers.\n\nBut we still have a big task ahead of us. The emergency is not over and the work, especially with the host communities, is more necessary than ever. To meet all these needs, we must continue to work as a team. That is why I invite and motivate all the actors of society so that we do not lower our arms. The world is giving us a great lesson and responding with a gesture of humanity and solidarity is the great door to continue saving lives.PROLOGUE / JUAN CARLOS MURILLOUNHCR /HUMAN MOBILITY IN CHILE",
    "Proposed new rules regarding foreign tax credits in Chile": "Chile has a unilateral and a bilateral foreign tax mechanism.\n\nThe unilateral tax credit mechanism is applicable for countries that have not signed a double tax treaty with Chile. It applies only to certain kinds of foreign-sourced income and is limited to a maximum rate of 35%.\n\nThe bilateral tax credit mechanism applies to foreign-sourced income earned from a country with which Chile has a double tax treaty. It applies to all kinds of income included in the treaty and is also limited to a maximum rate of 35%.\n\nSince the corporate income tax rate is 27%, if the foreign tax credit exceeds this amount, the difference up to 35% can be used against final taxes (surtax in the case of Chilean individuals and additional withholding tax in the case of foreigners earning Chilean-sourced income).\n\nAlso, if a foreign investment is held through different layers abroad, Chilean tax law allows the use of foreign tax credits, even if the corporate taxes are paid by entities indirectly held abroad, as long as the distributing entity is domiciled in the same country and it holds directly or indirectly an equity interest of more than 10%.\n\nUnder a tax change in 2020, if the corporate income tax is paid in a third country, different from the distributing country, corporate income taxes paid can also be used as a credit in Chile, as long as the distributing entity holds directly or indirectly an equity interest of more than 10% and the third country has an enforceable double tax treaty with Chile or an exchange of information agreement.\n\nThe bill\n\nIn March 2022, Gabriel Boric became the Chilean president.

    "Misinformation abounds as Chile prepares to vote on new constitution": "Chile is heading towards a historic plebiscite on a new constitution to replace the document drawn up during Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship, but the vote will take place amid a climate of uncertainty driven by a storm of falsehoods and divisive campaigns.\n\nFor weeks, television advertising spots, street canvassers and social media campaigns have attempted to sway opinion towards the two options which will appear on the ballot this Sunday: “approve” or “reject”.\n\n“We’re inundated with a tsunami of information,” said former advertising executive Eugenio García, 69, “Nowadays, it’s hard to tell what’s true, false, biased or malicious.”\n\nGarcía helped craft the campaign calling on Chileans to say no to eight more years of Pinochet’s rule in a previous plebiscite in the spring of 1988. They did so by a narrow margin.\n\n“There are similarities between then and now in that they want to change the moral fabric of the country,” said García, “But what is at stake this time is actually far greater – it is part of a global change.”\n\nOver 12 months, a democratically elected gender-equal convention, representing a vast range of agendas and political stances, worked to draft the new constitution.\n\nThe result of the process, presented in July, is a remarkably progressive document enshrining gender equality and Indigenous rights, expanding social protections and guaranteeing environmental protection.\n\nHowever, criticism has been levelled at its shake-up of the political system, which detractors argue was not the cause of the country’s discontent. Others have labelled the proposed constitution a “wishlist” of rights that will be hard to put into practice.\n\nPolling has consistently suggested that Chileans will reject the proposal in the referendum, in which everybody aged 18 or over must vote.\n\nBut if the constitution is approved, it will replace the 1980 document which, despite significant reforms, retains the ideological fingerprints of the Pinochet dictatorship under which it was drafted without democratic input.\n\nMapuche Indigenous people hold flags of approval of the new constitution in Temuco, Chile, this month. Photograph: Mario Quilodran/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAn insidious trend of misinformation has weighed heavily on the process since October 2020, when Chileans voted overwhelmingly in favour of drafting a new constitution.\n\n“With the first plebiscite there was a boom of misinformation,” said Valentina Matus, the editor of Contexto Factual.\n\n“Even though there wasn’t anything written yet, they were already saying that you could have your house taken away,” remembered Matus.\n\nDuring a televised campaign in 2021, a rightwing party falsely claimed that the new constitution would change Chile’s national anthem, flag – and even the name of the country.\n\nOnline, the daily swirl of false announcements and misleading interpretations of the text have made fact-checking difficult.\n\n“There are constant examples of statements that I don’t consider outright lies, but rather exaggerations,” said Eduardo Arriagada, an adjunct professor at the Pontifical Catholic University’s communications faculty in Santiago.\n\n“Constitutions don’t usually give details, they give broad definitions and allow for a range of scenarios for the law to sort out later, but that leaves them open to interpretation.”\n\nPredictably, the most emotive topics have been foregrounded.\n\nIn May, Senator Felipe Kast claimed that under the new constitution, abortion would be permitted up to the ninth month of a pregnancy. The text enshrines reproductive rights, but explicitly leaves the details up to the law.\n\nAnother recurring falsehood has been that private property could be confiscated under the new constitution.\n\nAmong the more outlandish claims, a website whose design mimicked that of the constitutional convention claimed that deprivatising the country’s water rights would outlaw the sale of bottled water and bags of ice for summer barbecues.\n\nIn response to a wave of false social media posts, one congressman even presented a bill in late July that would sanction sharing fake news about the constitution with a fine of around 33m pesos (£31,000).\n\n“From day one, the campaign against the new constitution manipulated what I said and sowed lies,” said Elisa Loncón, who represented the Indigenous Mapuche people in the convention and was elected its first president.\n\n“What they want is to silence and minimise us. All of the Mapuche women in the convention were subject to these attacks.”\n\nPeople demonstrate against the draft of the new constitution in Santiago at the weekend. Photograph: Martin Bernetti/AFP/Getty Images\n\nConfidence in the process was also rocked by scandal when a delegate was dishonourably excluded from the convention in September last year.\n\nA newspaper investigation revealed that Rodrigo Rojas Vade had falsely claimed to suffer from a rare form of leukaemia – the premise for his election as a campaigner for serious illnesses – and eventually resigned his seat.\n\nMore recently, activists on the fringe right have copied the tactics of the far-right leaders Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro, attacking Chile’s electoral service and hinting that they may not accept the result of the referendum.\n\nDespite the campaign, few seriously doubt the integrity of Chile’s electoral process. In its 2022 country report on Chile, the Freedom House NGO gave Chilean democracy a rating of 94 out of 100 – the second highest in Latin America – concluding that “Chile’s electoral framework is robust and generally well implemented”.\n\nBut efforts to allow Chileans to make an informed choice on Sunday have often met with resistance.\n\n“With misinformation getting there first, it’s hard to make sure the truth or fact-checking has the same reach,” said Matus.\n\n“Lies about emotional subjects will always outrun efforts to debunk them.”",

    "Chile’s Millennial President Is a New Kind of Leftist Leader": "Gabriel Boric climbs into the back of the gigantic black SUV waiting outside his house. It’s a cold morning in mid-August—winter in Santiago—and the Chilean President is enveloped in a slightly-too-long gray coat, making him look even younger than his 36 years. As the car rolls through city streets, windows down, pedestrians spot him on his way to work and let out whoops or an affectionate “Presi!” Boric laughs and waves, but then bows his head to nervously scan the front pages of Chile’s newspapers.\n\nThere’s plenty to be nervous about. Since taking office in March, Chile’s youngest-ever leader has been shepherding his country through a moment of historic uncertainty. For decades, Chile was touted as Latin America’s economic success story, with a business-friendly, small-government model creating relative wealth, and political stability, for its 19 million inhabitants. That narrative, however, concealed a long-simmering anger among many ordinary Chileans who, with little government support and expensive private services, struggle to make ends meet. In 2019, anger erupted: a small subway-fare hike set off massive, messy, months-long protests over inequality. Then politicians agreed to replace Chile’s constitution, a dictatorship-era document that underpins its market-driven economic system.\n\nRead More: Read the Transcript of TIME’s Interview With Chile’s President Gabriel Boric\n\nBoric, Chile’s most left-wing leader in half a century, owes his presidency to that upheaval. He was elected in December 2021, promising to lead Chile’s transition into the fairer country demanded by protesters. Five months into his term, it’s crunch time: in a Sept. 4 referendum, Chileans will vote on whether to approve a new constitution that offers sweeping progressive reforms, from a new health system to tighter controls on the mining industry. Supporters, including Boric, say it would make Chile a more democratic country and guarantee equality for marginalized groups; opponents say it would destroy the economy.\n\nAnd so the millennial President finds himself guiding his country through a kind of midlife crisis. “It’s a lot of responsibility, for sure,” Boric says after arriving at his bright, cluttered office in La Moneda, Chile’s presidential palace. “But I wake up every morning excited to keep working on this.”\n\nPhotograph by Luján Agusti for TIME\n\nBoric’s rise is part of a regional shift to the left. After a decade of right-wing domination, leftists have recently won power in five of Latin America’s six largest economies, many on platforms to fight inequality. The largest, Brazil, may join them after October elections.\n\nBut Boric is also something new. An older generation of Latin American leftists, including many still active today, have often made troubling sacrifices—disregarding the environment, democracy, or human rights—in pursuit of a socialist society. Boric says those issues are a core part of his progressive ideology. And although he became famous in Chile in his 20s as a shaggy-haired, radical student leader, today’s Boric is no firebrand—even if some may want him to be. “I think that as a society we should aspire to forms of organization that go beyond capitalism, but it’s not like I can say, ‘Capitalism ends today,’” Boric says, rapping the table with his knuckles, in a brief imitation of more militant figures.\n\nIn person, Boric is warm and quick to laugh, but he’s not relaxed. There’s an intensity buzzing beneath the surface. Over the course of several hours with TIME in La Moneda, he sometimes carries a pen and paper to take notes, listening with a furrowed brow. When he hears criticism, he scrunches up his face as if chewing on a hard math problem. Sometimes he agrees. “You have to keep doubting yourself, and listening to others, or you’ll forget why you’re here,” he says, in a rapid tumble of Chilean Spanish. “Sometimes that means going a little more slowly. I always say: we’re going slowly because we’re going far.”\n\nHow far depends on the Sept. 4 vote. Some Chileans have a growing sense that Boric is letting their country go off the rails: inflation is at a 28-year high, the peso’s value at an all-time low, and violent crime is surging. Boric’s approval rating stands at 38%, and polls now suggest that a majority of voters plan to reject the new constitution—a major blow to his agenda. Whatever happens, the world is watching the young President. “If Boric succeeds, I think it will have tremendous influence beyond Chile’s borders,” says Brian Winter, editor in chief of Americas Quarterly. “It will show that a new kind of leftist leader is possible.”\n\nBoric checks his phone in the corridor of La Moneda presidential palace on Aug. 12. Luján Agusti for TIME\n\nBoric grew up in Punta Arenas, a city of roughly 116,000 in remote southern Patagonia, where the wind blows so fiercely that streets have railings to stop people falling. The eldest of three boys, Boric was more bookish than his brothers, spending hours as a child reading novels brought home from work trips by his father, a Chilean engineer of Croatian descent—hence the pronunciation Bor-itch. Adventure stories were his favorite: tales of charming pirates, and children battling monsters.\n\nBut when he was 12 he came across a fantastical story that didn’t make sense to him. It was 1998, and Augusto Pinochet, the dictator who ruled Chile for 17 years, had just been arrested in London. Boric saw a group of women protesting on the news: they said Pinochet had made their relatives disappear. How could he make someone disappear, Boric wondered, if he wasn’t a magician?\n\nRead more: Chile Is Trying To Shed the Last Remnants of Its Pinochet-Era Dictatorship\n\nHe traded novels for history books to find the answer: in 1973, Chile’s military, led by Pinochet, had violently overthrown the country’s democratically elected Marxist President, Salvador Allende, installing a right-wing regime in his place. Pinochet was aided by the Nixon Administration, which was set on halting the spread of left-wing ideology during the Cold War. By the time Chile’s dictatorship ended in 1990, it had tortured and imprisoned nearly 30,000 opponents and executed 2,279. A further 1,162 victims would never be found.\n\nLearning about Pinochet sparked Boric’s political interest in his teens. He soon discovered other ways in which Chile’s dark past still loomed over its present. Pinochet, with the help of a group of right-wing U.S. economists, had turned his country into a laboratory for neoliberalism—a philosophy that sees free-market capitalism as the solution to all of society’s problems. (Decades later, during his election campaign, Boric would pledge that “if Chile was the cradle of neoliberalism, it’ll also be its grave.”) Pinochet shrank the role of the Chilean state, favoring private enterprise in the provision of education, health care, pensions, and even water.\n\nChile’s system has since lifted millions out of poverty. From 2000 to 2017, the share of Chileans living on less than $5.50 a day fell from 30% to 6.4%, per the World Bank. “That was important. But at the same time we were building a really unequal society,” Boric says. The cost of living has surged, and services exist in a two-tier system, where only those with money can access quality. For instance, 6 in 10 Chilean students pay to attend high school; Boric and his brothers were among them. “When I knew the history, I understood that the privileges that you have in a society as unequal as Chile are sustained by the fact that others don’t have them. It made me really angry.”\n\nHe expressed his anger as many teenagers do: he wore grungy pants and a lumberjack shirt, and grew out “the little facial hair I could,” he says. He got into punk and rock music: Pearl Jam, Metallica, Tool, Chile’s Los Prisioneros, and Argentina’s Charly García. (He still listens to music “almost constantly” and says rock dominates his playlists, despite the reputation he gained as a “Swiftie” when he tweeted support for Taylor Swift, after meeting her Chilean fan base: “They adopted me. I like Red, Folklore, ‘Cardigan.’ But it’s not the style of music I’m most into.”) Over meals, Boric would debate politics with his centrist father, and share “mediocre” poems he had written.\n\nBoric also found ways to act on his feelings. In 2000, at 14, he helped relaunch Punta Arenas’ high school student union, at a time when Chile was experiencing a revitalization of the student movement. A once potent political force, it had been repressed by Pinochet before petering out in the 1990s in a period of relative political apathy. Boric’s generation brought it roaring back. At 20, while studying law at the University of Chile in Santiago, he joined months of marches and building occupations by school and college students, demanding a fairer education system.\n\nBoric in 2012 with student leaders, including future official spokesperson Camila Vallejo, right. Fernando Lavoz—NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\nBoric became well known in 2011, when he was 25. That year, during another mass mobilization of hundreds of thousands of students, he was elected leader of Chile’s national federation of student unions. After his victory, an excited Boric told reporters that young people were tired of “the government and the political class, who want to commercialize all aspects of our lives.” A movement was coming, he said, “which would transform not only education, but the entire country.”\n\nThat movement had a few victories over the next few years. In 2013, four prominent figures from the student movement, including Boric, won seats in Congress, which was then made up of 158 legislators. But change was frustratingly slow, even under center-left President Michelle Bachelet (2014 to 2018). That’s partly because of Chile’s rigid constitution, written under Pinochet in 1980. Though it doesn’t explicitly endorse neoliberalism, it acts as a kind of ideological straitjacket by making many legislative changes dependent on approval by a constitutional court and a large majority in Congress. Those are hard to come by, thanks to an electoral system designed to produce stalemates. In 1979, the constitution’s writer said he aimed to “restrain whoever is governing” so that “if our adversaries get into power, they’ll be forced to take actions not so different to the ones we’d want.”\n\nFor a long time it seemed nothing could blast through that stagnation. Then, from October to December of 2019, roughly 3 million Chileans—some 16% of the population—took to the streets, led by students and other young people. The protests were sometimes violent; city centers were smashed up and set alight, and police responded brutally. Around 30 people died and hundreds were imprisoned by the government of right-wing President Sebastián Piñera. The period is now known as the social explosion.\n\nRead More: I Was Shot and Lost My Sight for Protesting Inequality in Chile. We Need to Keep Demanding Justice\n\nBoric, then in his second term as a Congressman, joined some of the protests, sharing many of the organizers’ concerns. But he was no longer the activist of his 20s. “We couldn’t just be agitators,” he says. “We had to offer an alternative, something to channel the conflict in some direction.”\n\nThat thinking led Boric, in November 2019, to champion an agreement with Piñera and other politicians to hold a referendum on whether or not to launch a project to replace the Pinochet-era constitution. It was controversial: left-wing politicians largely rejected the deal, fearing a constitutional process led by Piñera, a 72-year-old billionaire, would be designed to prevent real change, and represent a betrayal of the imprisoned protesters. In December 2019, a group of young protesters attacked Boric, emptying beer cans over his head while he sat on a park bench in Santiago. “You sold us out,” they shouted. In a video of the incident, Boric remains still. “I was reflecting in that moment,” he recalls. “They were accusing me of something that I didn’t believe I had done. And I still don’t. But it was hard, and it wasn’t the only time.”\n\nFor many, though, Boric’s willingness to work with political rivals legitimized him as a viable leader. Chile held that first referendum in October 2020, with 78% of voters opting to replace the constitution. Then the time came to replace Piñera as well, at scheduled 2021 presidential elections. In a surprise result in July 2021, a left-wing electoral coalition chose Boric as its candidate, over a Communist Party politician who had opposed the deal. In December, at the second round of the presidential election, Boric won 56% of the vote—a lead of 12 percentage points over José Antonio Kast, a far-right lawmaker with ties to the Pinochet regime.\n\nStephania Escobar, a handicraft seller at a central Santiago market in her 50s, was among those who voted for Boric. “It’s a big collective task we have on our hands. But he’s like a bridge,” she says, “a bridge to the changes we want to make.”\n\nWhen asked to describe their new President, many Chileans speaking to TIME use the word cercano (close) because Boric’s political style is less formal than most. He talks openly, for example, about his struggles with obsessive-compulsive disorder, which led him to check into a psychiatric clinic in 2018, and which still manifests in small gestures he makes at public events. He speaks candidly with TIME about gaining weight during his campaign, prompting him to start boxing in the mornings before work.\n\nRead More: Chile’s Protest Reflect Our Unequal Times\n\nBoric also lives physically closer to ordinary Chileans. The country has no official presidential residence, and previous leaders, largely elected in their 60s and 70s, have favored posh neighborhoods to the north of Santiago. After his election, Boric and his partner Irina Karamanos—a 32-year-old feminist activist he began dating in 2019—moved into a modest house in Yungay, a central neighborhood. Their neighbors are families and students living in subdivided, run-down buildings, and crime rates are high. The President’s team grumbles that he insists on walking to buy bread nearby, causing a minor security headache. Boric has also tried to make his office more approachable. He reopened a public square outside La Moneda that was previously cordoned off, and speaks with crowds gathered there most days.\n\nSome of it can feel a little contrived. But Tomás Boric, 29, the President’s youngest brother, says the down-to-earth image reflects what he saw growing up. “Most people spoke to me like a kid, but Gabriel never did,” he says. “He listened to me. He gave me his time. He does that for everyone.”\n\nBoric celebrates his victory with supporters on election night on Dec. 19. Felipe Figueroa—SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images\n\nBoric now finds himself at the helm of a bold social experiment. For decades, Latin America’s vast gap between rich and poor—one of the largest in the world—has stunted economies and fostered disruption: rapid swings from right to left, guerrilla wars, strongmen, coups, and corruption. In Chile, many hope that rewriting the constitution could address inequality in a uniquely democratic way—and perhaps serve as an example for other nations. “I feel so lucky to have been born at this time,” says Ericka Ñanco. Elected to Congress in November at age 29 to represent the southern Araucanía region, she is one of the youngest members of Boric’s coalition. “In other eras, the dreams of young people were crushed. Now we have the opportunity to change things.”\n\nThe new constitution was drafted by an assembly of 155 representatives, chosen at a special election in May 2021: 77 are women, and 17 are from Chile’s Indigenous communities, proportional to their 13% share of the population. Proponents of the new constitution say it imagines a better country, one that balances economic development with workers’ rights, environmental protections, and gender equality. It particularly emphasizes the rights of marginalized groups, including the autonomy of the Indigenous peoples, who were not even recognized in Pinochet’s constitution, over their own cultures, land, and institutions. The document calls for drastic changes to Chile’s political structures, as well as new national health care and education systems (private operators would remain, but with more oversight). In August, an international group of prominent progressive economists said the draft “prepares Chile for a new century of equitable growth.”\n\nNot everyone is sure of that outcome. Winter of Americas Quarterly says “the hope is that Chile is able to achieve developed world status in the next 10 or 20 years,” if it can reduce inequality, a major barrier to development. “I think that’s very much on the table. But the fear is that Chile will lose what made it an imperfect success story over the last 30 years.” That is, it could trade its stable market-driven economy for the stagnant, inflation-prone chaos of its neighbor Argentina, hurting poor as well as rich Chileans.\n\nRead More: Gabriel Boric: The Leftist Millennial Who Could Lead One of Latin America’s Wealthiest and Most Unequal Countries\n\nFor Kenneth Bunker, a Chilean pollster, the new constitution has too many flaws to accept. He sees it as a mishmash of the 155 assembly members’ diverse priorities. “It over-regulates so much that there will be a lot of fights about enacting it.” There are also specific concerns: a plan to abolish the Senate, for example, would leave many pieces of legislation subject to only one chamber’s approval, undermining Chile’s consensus-based political culture. Conservatives are also worried about the breadth of proposed spending: the Economist dubbed the document “a fiscally irresponsible left-wing wish list.” Some in Chile argue the document does not accurately reflect the wishes of the general population because turnout for the elections for the constitutional assembly was only 43%. More than half of the representatives chosen came from left or center-left blocs. Many others were progressive-leaning independents, while less than a third came from the right, according to Chilean media.\n\nBoric accepts that some parts of the text need more clarity before they become the law of the land. “There are always things that could be improved, and we’re having that debate,” he says. “But it’s a big step forward for Chile.” He is urging voters to approve it, promising Congress will reform the document after it passes.\n\nIt’s unclear if that will happen. Alongside legitimate debate, opponents of the new constitution have mounted a powerful misinformation campaign on social media and in paper leaflets. Among the false claims circulating are that the draft would abolish Chile’s police force, ban the sale of bottled water, allow abortion at any stage of pregnancy, and outlaw private property. Given the actual text runs to 170 pages of academic language, many voters are relying on others to interpret it for them. The most ardent opponents claim that adopting it would be Chile’s first step toward becoming the new Venezuela—whose socialist economy has imploded over the past decade—and that Boric is enthusiastically leading them down that path.\n\nIt may be true that Chile’s Communist Party makes up a fifth of Boric’s coalition in the lower house of Congress. But the President himself belongs to the more center-left Social Convergence Party, and his aspirations lie closer to European-style social democracy. “I don’t see a state controlling everything like in the socialisms of the 20th century, which failed,” he says. “We have to take ownership of that failure.”\n\nDeeply marked by the memory of the Pinochet regime, Boric is outspoken about violations of democracy and human rights—whether they come from the right or left. He has criticized far-left leaders in Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua who have embraced authoritarianism—a break from older leftists in the region, who tend to keep quiet about abuses on their own side. That attitude frustrates Boric, he says with a sigh. “I can’t get outraged when rights are violated in Palestine but not in Nicaragua, because when the defense of human rights is partial, it loses legitimacy. In Chile, we’re going to do things differently.”\n\nThe president peeks out from the balcony of the presidential house, Palacio de la Moneda, Aug. 12—the same one he used for his speech on the day of his inauguration as president. Luján Agusti for TIME\n\nWalking around the extravagantly upholstered furniture and high-ceilinged corridors of La Moneda, a museum-like colonial building where Presidents have worked since the 1800s, Boric can look a little out of place. He could be a hipster barista, with his trendy beard and tattoos peeking out of his shirt, or maybe a young -professor— a studious type who reels off suggested reading lists on request.\n\nMany Chileans seem happy to have a young President. But Boric is also battling a perception that he and his team, which includes several former student activists, are inexperienced. Some episodes feel like minor misfires: in rethinking the role of First Lady, Boric’s girlfriend briefly renamed her office “Irina Karamanos’ Cabinet,” leading to claims that she was personalizing the institution. Some feel ridiculous: right-wing media attacked Boric for leaving his fly down at an official meeting. (“Now I’m always worried when I’m getting out of the car,” he says.)\n\nBut Boric has also made some serious U-turns. In April, bowing to pressure from his left, he proposed allowing Chileans to withdraw money from their pension pots, despite having expressed fears that such moves worsen inflation. (The plan was rejected by Congress.) “He seems to draw a line in the sand. And then something happens and he has to follow others back over it,” says Bunker.\n\nThe most serious stumble so far has been on security. As a Congressman, Boric condemned Piñera’s decision to deploy the military to Araucanía, where small separatist groups from the Indigenous Mapuche community are engaged in a violent conflict with forestry companies. Security forces have killed several Mapuche people in high-profile cases. But in April, Boric remilitarized the region’s roads. The apparent about-face left the impression that Boric’s team doesn’t know what it’s doing, according to Salvador Millaleo, a Mapuche lawyer. “They did not prepare enough,” he says. “They underestimated both the importance and complexity of this issue.”\n\nBoric says his government “may have been a bit headstrong” in its initial approach to the conflict. “I am still convinced that the state of emergency is not the solution,” he says. But, he adds, “I am the President of all Chileans. So sometimes I have to do things I don’t like.” He pauses and, speaking slowly, disagrees that his U-turns indicate a failure of leadership. “Changing your position isn’t a weakness, as long as it’s coherent with your principles. I’m more concerned about people who can never change their mind.”\n\nBoric is hoping Chileans have not changed their minds about rewriting the constitution, though. If voters approve the new draft on Sept. 4, the national transformation Boric wants will begin in earnest: Congress will embark on a years-long project to draft new legislation. If they reject it, as polls suggest they will, Boric says the huge mandate from the October 2020 referendum will still apply: Chile would start again from scratch, holding elections for a fresh constitutional assembly to write a new draft. If that happens, parts of his agenda may be left in limbo.\n\nBut Boric says there’s still a lot he can do for Chile in the meantime. His government has pushed through a 17% minimum wage hike, and recently announced a bill to cut the workweek from 45 to 40 hours. In July, they unveiled a major tax reform to raise levies on high earners, capital gains, and mining companies. And after Congress approved a climate law in March, Boric’s Environment Minister, a climate scientist, has begun drawing up Chile’s plan to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\nRead more: An Indigenous Rights Leader Is Trying to Rewrite Chile’s Constitution to Put its Ecosystems First\n\nBoric also has wide discretion over foreign policy. He says he wants to refocus regional relationships away from 20th century ideological alliances, toward cooperation on climate action. A key aim is to band Latin America together “under one voice” to pressure richer countries to cut their emissions faster. That could include “making the exports of raw materials or clean energy conditional on changes in consumption behavior in more developed countries,” he says. (Chile holds major reserves of copper and lithium, essential for renewable technologies like electric cars.) He wants to attend October’s U.N. climate conference in Egypt to begin those discussions, he says. “Everyone has a responsibility, but some are more responsible than others. And we have to demand they meet theirs.”\n\nWhen Boric was preparing for his presidential portrait in the run-up to his inauguration in March, he and his team looked at those of all his predecessors. Each one seems to fit their era: 19th century colonial liberators in their military uniforms; early 20th century land barons in refined bow ties. Then Allende in 1970, slouching in a chair: unaware of what would happen to his government three years later. Next, Pinochet, another military man, severe and confident of his hold over Chile. Finally, the slick-suited statesmen—and woman—of the neoliberal era.\n\nBoric was sure of one thing: he wouldn’t wear a tie. He had long eschewed them, causing a minor sensation in the Chilean press. The dress code for leaders has changed over the centuries, he says, from “French kings in high heels and stockings” to “Barack Obama sitting on top of his desk.” He’s pretty confident that in 20 years, more Presidents will have nixed the tie. “I’m part of a transition here.”\n\nHe ended up with a photo in which he looks a little stiff, standing in front of the Pacific Ocean. It’s impossible to know what teleological meanings people will draw from it in a few decades. Is this the President defeated by a referendum a few months into his term? The one who blew up Chile’s economy and lost control of its security? Or the one who transformed his country and created a new model for Latin America’s left? On this, Boric is less willing to make predictions. “You can’t worry about how history will unfold,” he says. “If you do, you’ll get dizzy.”\n\n— With reporting by Solcyre Burga and Anisha Kohli/New York\n\nWrite to Ciara Nugent at ciara.nugent@time.com.",
    "Chile rejects its new constitution": "Chile rejects its new constitution\n\nChile has voted a resounding NO to a proposed constitution that would have put a focus on social issues and gender parity, enshrine rights for the indigenous population, and address climate change.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nIn Chile, a special assembly has spent the past two years writing a new constitution, and it was supposed to replace the current one that dates back to the country's military dictatorship. But yesterday, voters soundly rejected the new constitution in a referendum and then celebrated in the streets of Santiago.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF CAR HORNS HONKING, CHEERING)\n\nMARTIN: NPR's John Otis is just back from a reporting trip to Chile, and he joins us now. Good morning, John.\n\nJOHN OTIS, BYLINE: Good morning. It's good to be here.\n\nMARTIN: So people clearly excited. Tell us what this rejection means.\n\nOTIS: Well, the rejection means a huge blow for Chile's president, Gabriel Boric. He was a really big supporter of this new constitution. But nearly 62% of Chileans voted against it, compared to just 38% in favor. In fact, the outcome became so clear so quickly that the campaign for approval conceded defeat less than two hours after the polls closed.\n\nMARTIN: Wow. I mean, they clearly didn't have the right political temperature on how this was going to go over with voters. Why was it so controversial, this new constitution?\n\nOTIS: You know, some have called it the world's most progressive constitution. For example, it would have vastly expanded rights for Indigenous groups and created more protections for the environment. It would have made - it would have mandated universal health care, as well as the right to decent housing, education and pensions, and it calls for gender parity in government and legalized abortion. But Chile is actually quite a conservative place. Married couples couldn't even get divorced in Chile until 2004.\n\nSome of this new constitution might have hurt the economy because, for example, stricter environmental rules might have put the brakes on the copper and lithium mining industries. It would have meant higher taxes to pay for a lot of these new government benefits included in the constitution. There was also a disinformation campaign that spread lies about it. And finally, you know, the best constitutions are usually short and to the point, but this one was really long. It had 388 articles, and it was - just ended up being too much for voters to digest.\n\nMARTIN: Yeah. So if you could just step back for a moment, explain what was behind this movement to draft a new constitution in the first place?\n\nOTIS: Well, there were two reasons. First, anti-government protests back in 2019 nearly brought down Chile's government. To calm the waters and to address protesters' concerns about poverty and inequality, a special assembly began writing a new constitution. The other reason is that the current one was written back in 1980. That's when dictator Augusto Pinochet ruled Chile. Democracy was restored in 1990. And when most countries go through such momentous political changes, they write new rules of the game, new governing guidelines, but Chile never really got around to that until now.\n\nMARTIN: So, I mean, what happens? Is the effort to change the constitution dead at this point?\n\nOTIS: It's not dead. President Boric went on Chilean TV last night and claimed that the effort to forge a new constitution isn't over. Let's take a listen.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT GABRIEL BORIC: (Speaking Spanish).\n\nOTIS: So Boric is saying here that he plans to meet with Congress and civil society in the coming days to try to start this process all over again. This was expected because in spite of last night's rejection, polls show that Chileans don't like their Pinochet-era constitution either. But Boric has said whoever drafts the next version of the constitution, they're going to have to come up with something that unites Chileans rather than divides them, like this one did.\n\nMARTIN: John Otis reporting for NPR.

    "What's next for Chile after voters rejected a new constitution": "What's next for Chile after voters rejected a new constitution\n\nNPR's Ari Shapiro speaks with Antonia Laborde, a reporter for El País in Santiago de Chile after voters in the country rejected a new constitution. Now the country must consider a new path forward.\n\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\n\nNow that voters in Chile have rejected a new constitution, where does the country go from here? The proposal was full of progressive ideals - universal health care, Indigenous rights, abortion protections. And voters shot it down on Sunday by a margin of more than 20 points. Antonia Laborde is a correspondent in Santiago for El Pais, and she's here to talk about the path forward. Welcome.\n\nANTONIA LABORDE: Hello. Thank you for inviting me.\n\nSHAPIRO: President Gabriel Boric is already talking about a process that would lead to another constitutional proposal. And today he announced a new cabinet. How does he believe a second attempt to pass a new constitution would go differently from the first?\n\nLABORDE: Well, President Boric has called the leaders of the political parties and Congress to define how they will continue the constitutional process that he obviously supports. But it will be the Congress that defines the rules of this new game. Now, Boric may stand out a bit and focus more on governing. Surely we will see the president more focused on security and economic issues now.\n\nSHAPIRO: I'm curious what voters are telling you. When you talk to Chileans, what do they tell you about their reasons for rejecting the new constitution?\n\nLABORDE: Well, I heard the most enlightening thing in a town called San Pedro de Melipilla. This was the municipality of the metropolitan region that had participated the least in the entry referendum in October 2020. On that occasion, the vote was voluntary. And the people had to answer whether or not they want any constitution. On Sunday, the vote was mandatory. I can say two things here. There was a huge lack of information. They knew little, and what they knew was often not true. And second, for many, it was a referendum on the management of Boric, not the constitutional proposal.\n\nSHAPIRO: Two years ago, four out of five Chilean voters wanted to scrap the old constitution. So do you see a contradiction between that vote and this one? Is there a way to move forward and bridge those two realities?\n\nLABORDE: Well, in my point of view, since the riot of 2019, the political class is much more polarized than the citizens. People took the streets massively to protest against the inequalities in this country. Later, they may simply choose to change the Constitution. For me, the division is in the elite and not in the streets. The people want changes, but they simply felt that the constitutional proposal didn't suit them.\n\nSHAPIRO: How big of a factor was misinformation?\n\nLABORDE: Well, it was undoubtedly an election marred by fake news. The people against the proposal say that the new constitution will eliminate the flag, that it will be possible to abort up to nine months of pregnancy. Another recurring falsehood was been the private property will be confiscated under the new constitution. You know that we're living in times when social media campaigns are full of fake news, and it's very difficult to stop them. But save that, I think that it's important to clarify that the 3 million-plus voters who reject the proposal can't be attributed to fake news alone only.\n\nSHAPIRO: Yeah. This was a major blow to President Boric. Is he the man to lead the country into its next chapter? Do you think he can recover from this?\n\nLABORDE: Well, I think that this is an opportunity for Gabriel Boric. He can become the president who leaves behind a new constitution. So we may see decisions that are not very popular for the hardest left but more helpful for agreements. So we will see.\n\nSHAPIRO: That's Antonia Laborde, a journalist based in Santiago reporting for El Pais. Thank you very much.\n\nLABORDE: Thank you.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SLUM VILLAGE SONG, \"FALL IN LOVE\")\n\nCopyright © 2022 NPR. All rights reserved.

    "Chile's new constitution is put to the test at a vote": "Chile's new constitution is put to the test at a vote\n\nChile is debating a new constitution, to replace the one written during the country's 17-year-military dictatorship. Now it'll be ratified - or rejected - by voters in a September 4th referendum.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nThree years ago, anti-government demonstrations swept across Chile. They have now led to big change for the country on the Pacific coast of South America. A special assembly has written an entirely new constitution which must be ratified or rejected. NPR's John Otis is there.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED SINGER: (Singing in non-English language).\n\nJOHN OTIS, BYLINE: Folk musicians fire up the crowd here in the Chilean capital of Santiago. Hundreds have gathered to show their support for a new constitution. It would replace the old one that was written during the country's military dictatorship that lasted for 17 years.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish).\n\n(CHEERING)\n\nOTIS: It was a brutal period. In fact, this event is taking place just outside the national soccer stadium. It was turned into a concentration camp in 1973 when General Augusto Pinochet seized power and began arresting his opponents.\n\nANDRES SOLIMANO: Many people was killed here. They used torture, disappearance. It has a very sad history.\n\nOTIS: That's Andres Solimano, who at the time of the coup was in high school and saw several of his classmates arrested. Even though Chile is now a democracy, he points out that Chile's constitution was written during the dictatorship.\n\nSOLIMANO: Thirty-two years after the end of the Pinochet regime in 1990, we still have that constitution. So it's very much a due constitutional change.\n\nOTIS: There are other reasons why Chileans want to reset the rules for their nation.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish).\n\nOTIS: Despite years of economic growth, there's a large gap between rich and poor. That, plus low wages and rising costs for transportation, health care and education, led to violent protests in 2019.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST)\n\nOTIS: About 30 protesters were killed, and hundreds were injured. To calm the waters, the government agreed to a constitutional rewrite. Last year, Chileans elected a special assembly that spent 12 months drafting the new Magna Carta.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nOTIS: I pick up a copy at a kiosk in front of the presidential palace. It's long, with nearly 400 articles. Some strengthen women's rights, including the right to abortion. Others call for more protection for the environment and Indigenous groups and for better access to housing, education and pensions. But to guarantee more rights, Chile's left-wing government, which has been in power since March, will have to spend more, says political analyst Claudio Fuentes.\n\nSo all this is going to cost a lot of money.\n\nCLAUDIO FUENTES: For sure. And then the question will be taxes.\n\nOTIS: Indeed, the specter of higher taxes and more state intervention in the economy has turned off many Chileans, including retired police officer Hector Yanez.\n\nHECTOR YANEZ: (Speaking Spanish).\n\nOTIS: He says the current constitution opened the door for the best period of economic growth in Chile's history. There's also been a major TV campaign to convince Chileans to vote against ratification on September 4.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Speaking Spanish).\n\nOTIS: This TV spot claims, falsely, that the new constitution will provide more rights to criminals than to their victims. The negative messaging seems to be working. Recent polls show more Chileans plan to reject the new constitution than ratify it. If so, it would be a blow to President Gabriel Boric.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT GABRIEL BORIC: (Speaking Spanish).\n\nOTIS: In a recent interview on Chilean TV, Boric said he found it hard to imagine that the no-vote would prevail.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBORIC: (Speaking Spanish).\n\nOTIS: But if it does, Boric said, this isn't the end.

The initiative will focus on two of the most relevant Chilean products at the international level: salmon and mussels.\n\n\"Seafood is a common product on both coasts of the United States, but not so much in the hinterland of the country. With this campaign, we want the consumers unfamiliar with these foods to get to know those that Chile can offer and their benefits,\" said Alexander Grabois, representative of the ProChile commercial office in Philadelphia.\n\nGrabois explained that \"thanks to Chile's geography and vast water from the Pacific Ocean, the Chilean seafood industry offers a great variety of food that is remarkable in terms of freshness and quality.\"\n\n\"Giant Eagle is proud to partner with ProChile,\" said Giant Eagle Director of Seafood Rich Castle. \"We will be running a sales contest sponsored by ProChile, with the winning Team Members earning an educational and fun trip to Chile salmon and mussel farms. The winning Seafood Team Leaders will experience the pristine marine environment and sustainable efforts that will allow them to educate our guests about salmon and mussel farming in Chile.\"\n\nThe U.S., the leading market for salmon\n\nGrabois explained that, in the case of salmon, Chile is the second-largest exporter in the world and that the United States is the leading market for this product. \"Given the conditions of the southernmost sea in the world, the Chilean salmon has unparallel characteristics in terms of freshness,\" he said.\n\nAccording to him, \"Chilean salmon is a food with a high content of protein and unique flavor that provides a highly nutritious, healthy, and sustainable diet. Besides, it is easy to cook and quite versatile.\"\n\nFood innocuousness and sustainability are other features of this product. \"More than 70% of the salmon companies in Chile are certified for their good practices,\" he added.\n\nThe ProChile representative stressed that \"this industry plays a key role in the development of the South of Chile, not only due to the jobs that are created —70 thousand people work in this sector— but also due to the innovations of the goods and services that are exported to the rest of the world.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Chilean mussel is a high-quality product that is 100% natural, hatched in the cleanest and coldest South Pacific waters that come from Antarctica. \"It is a healthy, nutritious, and delicious product that represents the best of the Chilean shellfish,\" said Pedro Ovalle, president of the Commercial Committee at AmiChile, the mussel farmers association.\n\n\"Just like salmon, most companies that produce mussels have innocuousness and sustainability certification,\" added Ovalle. He also highlighted that \"the U.S. market leads the industry's export growth, with a 3.7% annual rise between January and July of 2022, compared with a 12.7% drop in global terms.\"\n\nGrabois invited people who live in Indiana, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia to visit the nearest Giant Eagle to learn about the more than 30 available products, among them fresh salmon, frozen salmon, Coho salmon, ready-to-eat salmon, dressed salmon, stuffed salmon, and mussels.\n\n\"Both salmon and mussels can be cooked and eaten with other Chilean products that are very well-known worldwide, such as olive oil, wine, and fruits,\" said the ProChile representative.\n\nAbout ProChile:\n\nProChile is an institution of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that promotes the sale of Chilean goods and services worldwide.\n\nThrough a network of more than 50 international offices and 16 offices in different regions of Chile, teams of specialized professionals work to strengthen the country's position in international markets, spread opportunities to invest in Chile, and promote tourism.

    "Lewis Hamilton’s X44 inherits Chile Extreme E victory": "The most remote X Prix so far\n\nFinally, following Covid-related event cancellations last year, Extreme E made its South American debut last week, as its ten teams tackled a short three-kilometre course in the Atacama desert, said to be the most remote and extreme setting used by the series so far.\n\nRXR began the weekend with a 31-point advantage at the top of the standings, which meant a second title was within range. Mikaela Åhlin-Kottulinksy and four-time World Rallycross king Johan Kristoffersson got their Chile weekend off to a strong start by topping qualifying and, although they were second in the heat, they won their semi-final. Loeb and Gutiérréz won their semi too, seemingly ensuring the title protagonists would face off as usual in the final. But disaster struck for Rosberg, when a software glitch meant RXR missed the deadline to make the grid for the climax – the first time in two seasons that the inaugural champion team hadn’t raced in the final.\n\nThat meant Chip Ganassi Racing made a surprise last-minute appearance as first reserve, joining Acciona Sainz and Abt Cupra – plus McLaren which had qualified by winning the so-called (and as it turned out suitably-named) ‘Crazy Race’.",
    "Venezuelan Migrants and Refugees Defy Deadly Desert Conditions on Their Journey to Chile - Chile": "Colchane, 29 August 2022 – Jhonny, 26, along with his wife, Cribsel, 19 and six months pregnant, sit with their two children at a migrant reception centre. Sunburned and gasping for breath, the 3,700-meter-high altitude and freezing climatic conditions have noticeably taken their toll on this young family of four.\n\nThe family trekked for five hours from Bolivia to Chile. Since first leaving Venezuela on foot two months and some 5,000-odd kilometers ago, they have gone through five border crossings. \"It was the first time we experienced cold weather. This part has been the toughest,\" Jhonny says with split lips and cracked feet. \"We were not prepared with winter coats or blankets.\"\n\nThe construction worker lost his job in Venezuela and simply covering basic necessities became impossible for the family of four. They decided to leave their hometown of Aragua with just USD 450 and a backpack of essentials to venture upon the long walk across the Andean highlands, first crossing into Colombia, and later Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia, sleeping on the streets throughout most of their journey.\n\nTheir story is far from an isolated case. Often in small groups, exhausted people are on the move along one of the most extensive migration routes in the world, mainly embarking on foot with periodic intervals by bus, taxi and other forms of transport. For Venezuelans travelling to Chile, the last hurdle is the grueling Atacama Desert, the driest and highest plateau in the world at nearly 4,000 meters above sea level and with temperatures dropping below minus 10 degrees Celsius.\n\nMany migrants and refugees travel irregularly across these routes, confronting dangers such as robbery and the risk of sexual exploitation and abuse by criminal groups. According to Medical Legal Services, seven people have died since the beginning of 2022, either due to exposure to extreme conditions or due to health complications stemming from pre-existing medical conditions exacerbated by the inhospitable terrain of the Atacama Desert.\n\nNear the Chilean town of Colchane, and upon crossing the shared border with Bolivia at dawn, Jhonny’s family, alongside other migrants, are relieved to find much-needed life-saving humanitarian assistance. They arrive hungry, and suffering from hypothermia, dehydration, and altitude sickness.\n\nAs of July 2022, there were approximately 127,000 migrants who entered Chile through irregular crossing, according to estimates by Chilean authorities. Many enter Chile every day through Colchane, a small village of less than 500 residents, of whom 85 per cent are indigenous. Many are often driven by the desire to reunify with their family members and to contribute to host communities.\n\n“Our goal is to work and do something constructive. I want people to think of me as a Venezuelan who has something positive to give. This will help change the perception they have about us,” Jhonny adds.\n\nExtreme winter conditions increase hardship\n\nAfter several trying months since first arriving in Chile, Francisco and his family have had to grapple with low-temperature conditions living on the streets of the City of Iquique, a drastic difference from the tropical conditions in their hometown. The family of five now finds refuge at a temporary shelter financed and managed by the International Organization for Migration (IOM).\n\n“We were sleeping under a blanket, embracing each other for warmth, that was moreover covered in ice. We had to use our bags as pillows to prevent robbery during the night.”\n\nMaria, 18, has finally achieved a degree of stability after giving birth to a healthy baby boy in Chile. She now has a place to live in Iquique and is among hundreds receiving humanitarian assistance from IOM in the form of cash vouchers, hundreds of which have been distributed to vulnerable families to provide them with means to buy food, hygiene products, and warm clothing.\n\nAcross Chile, IOM has stepped up its presence and the delivery of humanitarian assistance to respond to the direct needs of migrants and refugees arriving to the country.\n\n“We are distributing food, water, medical care, shelter and basic relief items such as blankets and winter clothes provided by NGOs,” said Susan Saavedra, IOM Project Assistant in Colchane. Furthermore, IOM has deployed a medical team to carry out first-aid care, an intervention that benefits migrants and host communities.\n\nSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, IOM in Chile has had field staff stationed in Colchane to allow for the rapid coordination and implementation of humanitarian assistance.\n\nIn coordination with authorities and civil society organizations, IOM has put in place the necessary infrastructure to temporarily house the migrant population in transit, and attend to their pressing humanitarian needs. Since 2014, more than 6,8 million Venezuelans have left their country; around 450,000 live in Chile.\n\nSeeking a lifeline\n\nJaneth Perez, 36, never thought she would one day have to leave her beloved home. Back in her native Venezuela, she was a Math and Physics high school teacher, but the financial situation forced her to leave her life and profession behind. She began the long road to Chile, alone, and with the hopes of finding a new beginning.\n\nFollowing an arduous 11-day journey by bus, she recently arrived in Chile and is determined to get to the port city of Valparaiso, approximately 2,000 kilometers south of the Bolivian-Chilean border, in order to reunite with her sister and start a new life working at a supermarket.\n\n“With this new job I will be able to provide for my 15-year-old son and mother, whom I left behind in my hometown of Barinas. I am so grateful for this new opportunity and a new beginning,” she said, reaching Chile exhausted after a final ten-hour passage by foot.\n\nDespite all these challenges, Janeth and many others are grateful for the opportunity to be able to work and support their families, both in Chile and back home in Venezuela. She dreams of regularizing her status, validating her university diploma and working as a teacher, her passion.\n\n“The future I imagine is one where I can once again teach in order to earn enough money to buy a house and go back home with my son and mother to live together in peace.”\n\nThis story was written by Gema Cortés, IOM Media and Communications Unit, Office of the Special Envoy for the Regional Response to the Venezuelan Situation.",

    "Opinion | Chile’s Constitutional Moment Is Not Over": "This monthslong campaign to turn down the new Constitution gained a foothold and never slipped. A barrage of misinformation spread through WhatsApp and social media, and outsize political donations and murky spending gave a financial advantage to the rejection campaign, which no doubt had an effect on voters. The effort was brutal, and brutally effective, in its aim to mislead Chileans to believe that the new Constitution would, among other horribles, spell the end of homeownership and allow abortions up to the moment of birth.\n\nThis campaign of doubt, fear and lies cannot be discounted. It tapped into something real that no amount of fact-checking and debunking could overcome: that Chileans, above all, want safety. And a text that is not born of consensus, comity and common ground simply cannot provide it.\n\nNo constitution is perfect, let alone a safe haven, and voters know or should know better than to think that a written text will solve all their problems. Yet it is entirely reasonable for a voter to conclude, especially one on the fence who is more worried about putting food on the table, that any proposal causing so much division, manufactured or not, is not the path forward. This explains why even many of those so-called popular districts that voted in droves for Mr. Boric, as well as those hardest hit by poverty and in need of the most change, voted to reject the new Constitution. Or why the very Indigenous groups that would have been granted historic recognition and autonomy in the new text also largely opted to reject it.\n\nMr. Boric has been wise to recognize these failings. In an address to the nation after Chileans’ choice became clear last week, he said the as-yet-unwritten Constitution needed to “give us a sense of trust” and to “unite us as a country.”\n\nTo that end, with Mr. Boric’s blessing, the National Congress is already at work setting the parameters for how to start over on a new Constitution — who will draft it, for how long and how to narrow in on the substantive areas where there’s already unity. There exists wide agreement, for example, that the new Constitution must recognize something the old one doesn’t: that Chile is a social and democratic state where rights, equality and wellbeing are guaranteed, no matter a person’s status or station in life.\n\nThat’s the floor. That’s the beginning of safety. The promise, and peril, of the road ahead rests in ensuring that all Chileans agree on these essentials, agree to disagree on the nonessentials and come together on what’s left. That won’t be easy — and bad-faith actors uninterested in change could well again torpedo it. But it’s the only way Chile will have a Constitution that makes room for all.",

    "Argentina and Chile Deter Costly Fruit Fly Outbreaks with Help of Nuclear Technology": "In 2019, twenty-four years after Chile declared itself Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly) free, the country experienced one of its largest outbreaks — costing the economy approximately US$ 5 million. Worried about future outbreaks, which are caused by the movement of people and fruit from countries where the medfly is present, in 2020 Chile’s Agricultural and Livestock Service (SAG), in collaboration with Argentina’s National Food Safety and Quality Service (SENASA), the IAEA and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), decided to apply the sterile insect technique (SIT) as a preventive measure.\n\nIn the north of the country, at Arica, Chile is producing sterile flies to be released over areas at risk of outbreaks in the Metropolitan Region of Santiago. These locally produced sterile flies are complemented with imported medflies from a facility in Argentina. By mating with the wild female population, the sterile insects reduce the number of offspring, resulting in rapid gradual elimination. When used as preventive measures, they eliminate emerging population as soon as they arise.\n\n“By using the SIT for prevention, we’ve successfully reduced the number of outbreaks and reduced the use of environmentally harmful conventional methods such as chemical applications by 60 per cent,” said Jocelyn Elena Yevenes Flores, Head of the Fruit Flies Sub-department at SAG.\n\nIn Argentina, SIT has been applied as a preventive strategy since 2005. Today, the preventive releases of sterile flies in the country is done over 34,700 hectares of land, including in fruit fly pest free areas of Mendoza and Patagonia. Between 1,500 to 4,500 sterile males are released per hectare two to three times per week. These flies are mass-reared and sterilized at the Santa Rosa facility of the Agricultural Health and Quality Institute (ISCAMEN)’s located in Mendoza.\n\nThe facility is the largest Mediterranean fruit fly mass rearing facility in South America, with a production capacity of 700 million sterile male flies per week. Moreover, a Fly Emergence and Release Facility, located in south of the Mendoza Province, has a capacity to process 500 million sterile flies per week — a strategic link in supplying sterile flies needed in Mendoza and Patagonia.",

    "Chile’s avocado season starts with less production due to frost – Produce Blue Book": "The Chilean 2022-23 avocado season began with an estimated production of 186,423 tons, representing a drop of 14.4 percent compared to the 217,000 tons the previous season, as reported by Mundoagro.\n\nThis projected decrease is due to less favorable natural conditions, such as the drought and, mainly, the frosts that affected the crops during the end of May and the beginning of June, which resulted in lower productions in most of the areas of the country where the fruit is produced.\n\nIt is expected that 55 percent of the fruit will be for export, mainly Western Europe, an area that has established itself as one of the main commercial destinations for Chilean avocados.\n\nThe remaining 45 percent will go to the domestic market, which consolidates this fruit as one of the main crops in the country with the highest percentage of its production being sold in Chile.\n\nJose Gabriel Correa, the president of Chile’s avocado committee, said, “although we had a more complex winter due to the frosts, the Chilean industry has demonstrated its enormous capacity for resilience and its high competitiveness in the world. This is especially relevant if we consider that agriculture has been challenged by the local and global context, with great complexities in freight and logistics costs, sharp rises in the prices of production inputs, and the difficulties of the drought.”",
    "Mechanical harvesters could help chile farmers with labor shortage": "NEW MEXICO (KRQE) – Chile farmers have faced some challenges this year. The weather conditions, paired with labor shortages, has made it difficult to harvest their crop. There may now be a solution to solve the workforce problem in the coming years. “The solution to labor is mechanized harvest,” said Executive Director of New Mexico Chile Association (NMCA) Travis Day.\n\nChile roasting season is in full force. While the smell of roasting green chile fills the New Mexico air, it wasn’t an easy season for some chile farmers. One of the challenges was the lack of help.\n\n“We can’t get hardly any people that want to work in the fields anymore. We’re going to have to do something different next year because it was hard getting workers,” said the Owner of Big Jim Farms, Jimmy Wagner.\n\nThe NMCA hopes to help with staffing and labor shortages. However, it won’t be more people to help; it’ll be with the use of machines.\n\nDay mentioned, “We want to see more innovation and technology within our industry and with ag in general. We see the mechanized harvest and the ability to harvest chile out of the fields using a machine as a long-term solution for labor shortages.”\n\nThe machines will help pick the chile. There’s a biological component to all of this because regular chile can’t survive machinery in the field. That’s why a new variety of chile must be created.\n\n“If you look at your traditional varieties, they’re not made to go through machines. They bruise pretty easily and then the plants themselves are not built for mechanized harvest,” said Day.\n\nThe NMCA is working on it. Day explained with New Mexico State University’s help; one chile type was created to be tough enough. They hope to use those traits and move them across the state. That way, any chiles can be picked out of fields with a machine. However, the machines are not ready just yet. “We’re seeing machines being developed in southern New Mexico that are going through field trials. They’re working very well,” said Day.\n\nAccording to Day, it’s safe to say a mechanized harvest will be a reality in the next couple of years. The NMCA wasn’t able to send KRQE photos of the machines because the creators are working through the patent process.",

    "Urfa Chile Makes Everything Better, Including This Chocolate Bar": "This is Highly Recommend, a column dedicated to what people in the food industry are obsessed with eating, drinking, and buying right now.\n\nDried chiles were a staple in my household, and my mother always kept three kinds in our pantry: pul biber (flaked chile), kırmızı toz biber (powdered chile), and Urfa biber. The latter, also known as Urfa chile, is my absolute favorite of the three. It’s a souvenir I bring back in bulk whenever I visit my family in Turkey, and I use it on almost everything: Turkish-style poached eggs, fresh salads and mezze, and even leftover pizza. Grown in the hills surrounding Urfa in southeastern Turkey, it’s a purplish-black spice that packs a smoky kick and subtle sweetness, adding serious depth and nuance to any dish or snack—including my favorite Spring & Mulberry chocolate bar.\n\nThere are a lot of fancy chocolates on the market, but Spring & Mulberry is the one I always keep stocked in my snack cabinet. Made with 72% cacao and sweetened only with dates, Spring & Mulberry’s chocolate bars comes in five flavors: Pure Dark Chocolate; Mixed Berry; Medjool Date, Pecan, and Himalayan Salt; Lavender, Bee Pollen, and Rose Petal; and—my go-to—Mango, Urfa Chili, Black Lime.\n\nEach chocolate bar is visually striking, with flecks of smoky Urfa chili flakes from Spicewalla and succulent mango slices pressed into the bar like mosaic tiles. The first time I picked one up at dinner party shop Big Night in Brooklyn, I thought, “Maybe it’ll taste like chocolate-covered dried mangoes.” But when I snapped a piece off and popped it into my mouth, it summoned a bewitching savory sweetness followed by a delightful kick, unlocking a core memory. That one bite transported me right back to my mother's kitchen, where I could always smell the spice in the air.\n\nThanks to the generous amount of dried fruit, the chocolate bar itself is pretty hefty. While I have eaten a whole bar in a single sitting, two squares are usually more than enough to satisfy if I’m in need of a chocolate pick-me-up. The combination of the chocolate and mango tastes heavenly, but it’s the Urfa chili flakes that seal the deal for me. With each bite, I’m reminded of my summers in Turkey—even if I’m just sitting on the couch with my partner in Newark.",
