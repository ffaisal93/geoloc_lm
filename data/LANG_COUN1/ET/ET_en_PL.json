    "Anti-Ukrainian protest in Poland attracts no participants": "A protest against the reception of Ukrainian refugees in a town near Poland’s border with Ukraine at the weekend attracted no participants. Meanwhile, another event in Warsaw – at which two nationalist MPs spoke – drew only a small crowd.\n\nFigures from the nationalist Confederation (Konfederacja) have in recent weeks been promoting the slogan “Stop the Ukrainisation of Poland”. The party, which has long been opposed to mass immigration from Ukraine, claims that Ukrainian refugees are being given “privileges” not granted to Poles.\n\nOn Saturday, the party promoted a march and protest in Warsaw against the “threats posed by the massive influx of people from Ukraine”. One of Confederation’s leaders, Grzegorz Braun, called on all “Polish patriots” opposed to the “de-Polonisation and Ukrainisation of Poland” to attend.\n\nOn the day, between 150 and 200 people turned up, report Gazeta Wyborcza and Kresy.pl. They marched from Parade Square to the presidential palace, with one placard reading: “President [Andrzej Duda], you did more in one month for Ukrainians than in seven years for Poles.”\n\nParticipants also displayed banners with the logos of far-right groups All-Polish Youth (Młodzież Wszechpolska) and the National Movement (Ruch Narodowy). Among those to speak to the crowd were Braun and another of Confederation’s leaders, Krzysztof Bosak.\n\nBosak accused the Polish government of “pursuing a policy [to support refugees] beyond the financial capacity of Polish citizens”. He pointed to the rising prices of housing and the costs of providing benefits to Ukrainians as evidence.\n\nA group of counterprotesters held signs saying “Down with fascism”, “Braun to Moscow” and “Poland is home to everyone”.\n\nPanie Pośle, moja 7-letnia siostra chodziła do polskiej szkoły w kwietniu, ale już wróciła na Ukrainę.

The only interest shown was from a man who came to argue with her.\n\nAfter Polish media reported on the lack of turnout, Pikuła, who has also tried to organise other protests in the region, defiantly tweeted that “we will continue to relentlessly do our work [against] the deliberate colonisation of Poland by Ukraine” and that she “will talk even to the first passerby”.\n\nThe far right organised an anti-Ukrainian protest in the town of Sanok and precisely zero people turned up.

But they have consistently failed pic.twitter.com/0BmR1YiFcl — Daniel Tilles (@danieltilles1) September 25, 2022\n\nPoland has been the largest recipient of refugees from Ukraine, millions of whom have crossed its border since Russia’s invasion in February. It is estimated that between 1 and 1.5 million remain in the country, as well as a similar number of Ukrainians who have previously migrated to Poland.\n\nPoles have been overwhelmingly welcoming of the arrivals. A poll in July showed that 77% of the public had been involved in helping refugees, spending around 9-10 billion zloty (€1.93-2.14 billion) out of their own pockets on doing so.\n\nOther polling has shown overwhelming support for Ukraine in its defence against Russian aggression, and for the Polish government’s strong pro-Ukrainian and anti-Russian stance.\n\nHowever, from the early stages of the crisis, Confederation – which has 12 MPs in parliament – and other far-right groups have sought to raise concern about the mass influx of Ukrainians and the impact it could have economically, politically and culturally on Poland.\n\nIn recent weeks, the hashtag #StopUkrainizacjiPolski (#StopTheUkrainisationOfPoland) has often been trending on Twitter. However, analysis by the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab found that it had been boosted by “inauthentic” activity from “accounts exhibiting signs of bot-like behavior”.\n\nResearch by state pollster CBOS found that, whereas in March only 3% of the public believed Poland should not accept Ukrainian refugees from conflict zones, by July that had risen to 11%.\n\nA largely inauthentic network in #Poland pushed an anti-Ukrainian refugee hashtag to trending. Its primary accounts created a false impression regarding its relative popularity in the country.https://t.co/APAkKqr3ux — DFRLab (@DFRLab) September 4, 2022\n\nMain image credit: Karolina Pikuła/Facebook (screenshot)",
    "Roger Waters gigs cancelled in Poland after Ukraine comments": "The Pink Floyd co-founder, who was booked to play in Poland in April, denies claims that he or his management cancelled events.\n\nConcerts by Pink Floyd co-founder Roger Waters have been cancelled by a venue in the Polish city of Krakow after the artist’s comments on the war in Ukraine caused a storm of criticism.\n\nWaters was to appear in Krakow in April, but Polish media reports about an open letter he wrote to Ukraine’s first lady Olena Zelenska urging her to ask her husband to choose “a different route” and criticising the West for supplying Ukraine with arms provoked a fierce backlash.\n\n“Live Nation Polska and Tauron Arena Krakow have cancelled Roger Waters’ concert,” organisers said in a statement on the venue’s website. They did not elaborate on the reason for the cancellation.\n\nOn Saturday, state-run news agency PAP reported that a spokesperson for the Tauron Arena said Waters’ management cancelled the concert without giving a reason.\n\nPoland counts itself among Kyiv’s staunchest allies, and public support for the Ukrainian cause is very high.\n\nLocal councillors in Krakow were to vote on a resolution declaring Waters “persona non grata” on Wednesday.\n\n‘Leave Them Kids Alone!’\n\nIn a social media post, Waters said it was not true that he or his management cancelled the concerts and criticised local councillor Lukasz Wantuch over the vote to declare him unwelcome in the city.\n\n“Lukasz Wantuch has threatened to hold a meeting asking the council to declare me ‘persona non grata’ because of my public efforts to encourage all involved in the disastrous war in Ukraine, especially the governments of the USA and Russia, to work towards a negotiated peace,” Waters wrote in a post on Facebook.\n\n“If Mr Lukasz Wantuch achieves his aim, and my forthcoming concerts in Krakow are cancelled, it will be a sad loss for me, because I have been looking forward to sharing my message of love with the people of Poland.\n\n“Lukasz Wantuch seems to know nothing of my history of working, all my life, at some personal cost, in the service of human rights,” Waters added.\n\nParaphrasing the words of his hit single Another Brick in the Wall, Waters also wrote: “Hey! Lukasz Wantuch! ‘Leave Them Kids Alone!'”.",
    "Belarusian propaganda targets Poland": "\"When Putin talks about the threat from NATO, he means the United States and possibly Britain. When Lukashenko talks about the threat from NATO, he means Poland and Lithuania,\" said Polish journalist Michal Potocki.\n\nPotocki thinks Belarus' authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenko, deems it a threat that Polish television station Belsat broadcasts from Poland to Belarus in the Belarusian language, and that the Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya is living in exile in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius.\n\nJournalist Michal Potocki has been drawing attention to the oppression of the Polish minority in Belarus\n\nLukashenko's view of Poland is primarily influenced by the events of August 2020, when there were mass protests in Belarus against the disputed presidential election, said Alexander Friedman, a Belarusian historian. \"Lukashenko believes that just because Nexta is based in Warsaw, the Polish state must be behind it,\" he said.\n\nThe Nexta media outlet, distributed via Telegram, was founded by the Belarusian activist Stsiapan Putsila, who currently lives in Warsaw. More than 2 million subscribers turned to Nexta during the protests to stay informed about what was happening. Belarus has classified the channel as extremist.\n\nBelarusian political scientist Alexander Klaskovsky stressed that Lukashenko has always been anti-Western, but said his rhetoric intensified after he \"became an accomplice in Russia's aggression against Ukraine.\" Klaskovsky said Lukashenko is simply trying to justify himself with statements like: \"If we hadn't attacked, they would have attacked us first.\"\n\nWhat lies behind Lukashenko's antipathy toward Poland?\n\nFriedman assumes Lukashenko's antipathy toward neighboring Poland developed during the Soviet era. Back then, Poland was seen as a country that still bore characteristics of the \"feudal era.\"\n\nKlaskovsky also believes Lukashenko's prejudices are based on stereotypes about the \"exploitative Polish ruling class.\"\n\n\"He thinks the Poles want to conquer half, or even all, of Belarus. Actually, there isn't a single serious politician in Poland who pursues revanchist ideas,\" said Klaskovsky.\n\nKlaskovsky said Belarusian propaganda picks on historical themes in order to manipulate people. \"There was indeed a time when the western part of Belarus was under Polish rule, and the Belarusians who lived there were not treated well. But should we reopen these wounds? Today, Poles and Ukrainians are demonstrating that historical resentments can be put aside,\" he said.\n\nPoland erects new border fence with Belarus\n\nVadim Gigin, head of the Belarusian national public association Belarusian Society Knowledge, has expressed the view that Minsk should demand reparations from Warsaw for the years 1921 to 1939, when western Belarus was part of Poland.\n\n\"This issue has arisen against the background of Polish claims against Germany and has been seized on by propagandists in Belarus and Russia,\" said historian Friedman. However, from a legal point of view, he said, Belarusian claims are completely untenable.\n\nDestruction of Polish gravesites\n\nBelarus has a difficult relationship with all its neighbors, said Klaskovsky, adding that Russia is the only one it doesn't dare confront. It does, however, trample on the Poles, in this case literally: the graves of Polish soldiers.\n\nIn July, graves of soldiers from the Polish Home Army in Belarus were destroyed, triggering outrage in Warsaw. The Home Army was a resistance and military organization in German-occupied Poland during World War II. It was made up of volunteers, whose goal was the liberation of Poland from the occupying German army. After the Soviet Red Army invaded they were disarmed; many officers were shot, or imprisoned in the Soviet gulag. Some continued their resistance, this time against communist rule.\n\nFriedman believes the destruction of the graves replicates the Soviet attitude to places of burial. \"If cemeteries are not their own but those of their enemies, they are simply destroyed,\" he said. \"That was what the Soviets did to Jewish and Catholic cemeteries, for example, and also to German ones after the war. The Belarusian state power sees the graves of soldiers of the Polish Home Army as enemy gravesites.\"\n\nAccording to Friedman, it is no coincidence that Belarusian propaganda concentrates on the Home Army, or on Poland of the 1920s, a period that occupies a special place in Polish memorial culture. \"This is an important historical period for the current conservative government in Poland, and attacking this period is also an attack on the current Polish government,\" he said.\n\nIs Belarusian propaganda achieving its objectives?\n\nFriedman: In Poland, 'Lukashenko ... is just seen as a vassal of Russia'\n\nAccording to Polish journalist Michal Potocki, the destruction of graves and demands for reparations do hurt Warsaw — and the Belarusian government knows this. Potocki also pointed out that independent organizations of the Polish minority in Belarus are being suppressed, and Polish schools are being closed.\n\nKlaskovsky refers to Lukashenko's announcement that he intended to clarify the \"orientation\" of Belarusian citizens who possessed a \"Karta Polaka,\" an identity card issued by the Polish state confirming that a person belongs to the Polish nation. More than 160,000 Belarusians with Polish roots are in possession of such a document. Lukashenko declared that these people should report to the Belarusian authorities. Klaskovsky said Lukashenko believes these people to be a so-called \"fifth column\" — Belarusian citizens whose loyalty is actually to Poland.\n\nHowever, Klaskovsky believes that, in spite of the propaganda, Belarusian society does not regard Poland as an enemy. Opinion polls indicate that the propaganda narrative isn't working; meanwhile, the rhetoric from Belarusian authorities scarcely registers in Poland.\n\n\"People do discuss it, but it's not the No. 1 topic,\" said Potocki. \"Poles talk about the economic situation and the energy crisis, and when the conversation turns to foreign policy, of course they talk about Ukraine. As far as Lukashenko is concerned, he's just seen as a vassal of Russia.\"\n\nThis article was originally published in Russian",
    "Poland welcomes right-wing election successes in Italy and Sweden": "Leading figures from Poland’s ruling camp, including Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, have welcomed the electoral success of right-wing and far-right parties in Italy yesterday, as well as in Sweden’s recent election.\n\nImmediately after exit polls last night predicted a victory for the Brothers of Italy (FdI) party – which sits in the same European grouping as Poland’s ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party – Morawiecki tweeted congratulations to Giorgia Meloni, FdI’s leader and the likely new Italian prime minister.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, with FdI predicted to win the election, Morawiecki had declared himself “happy that a tremor is running through the EU”, reported the Polish Press Agency (PAP).\n\nWith the likely new governments in Italy and Sweden – where the nationalist Sweden Democrats are now the second largest party – “watching the interests of nation-states…Europe is becoming a Europe of real values”, said Morawiecki.\n\nPiS chairman Jarosław Kaczyński had also declared Sunday to be “a day of hope, hope that the EU will start to change”, reports news website wPolityce.\n\nJarosław Kaczyński: Wybory we Włoszech?

Polish deputy foreign minister Paweł Jabłoński hailed FdI’s “historic victory”.\n\nDeputy justice minister Michał Wójcik, who belongs to PiS’s hard-right junior coalition partner United Poland (Solidarna Polska), said that Meloni’s victory was a “defeat for [European Commission President Ursula] von der Leyen, the representative of the anti-democratic forces in the EU”.\n\n“Abnormality in the EU is ending,” declared Wójcik. “The rule of manipulators and lunatics in the European Commission is slowly coming to an end.”\n\nPrzedstawicielka antydemokratycznych sił w UE von der Leyen doznała klęski.

    "New Polish gas pipeline from Norway to reach full capacity ahead of schedule": "Poland’s new pipeline bringing Norwegian gas via Denmark and through the Baltic Sea – which is due to open this week – will be able to transport up to twice as much gas as previously planned this year due to the faster-than-expected progress of work.\n\nThe Baltic Pipe, which is seen as a key element in Poland’s diversification away from Russian energy sources, is due to begin transporting gas this Saturday, 1 October, with an initial capacity equivalent to 2-3 billion cubic metres (bmc) per year.\n\nIt was then expected to reach its full capacity of 10 bcm of gas per year at the start of 2023. However, on Saturday Danish gas system operator Energinet announced that work “is progressing so well” that full capacity is due to be reached by the end of November this year.\n\n“We are pleased to announce that a major part of the vast project has [already] been completed and is ready for use,” said Torben Brabo, Energinet’s director of international relations.\n\n“Due to an extraordinary effort on the part of everyone involved, we were able to lay the remaining pipelines faster than expected,” he added. “Full commissioning can therefore take place ahead of time.”\n\nLater on Saturday, the Polish government’s commissioner for strategic energy infrastructure, Mateusz Berger, confirmed the news to the Polish Press Agency (PAP) and revealed that the accelerated schedule would allow up to twice as much gas as planned to be imported in the final quarter of 2022.\n\nA day earlier, Norway’s state-owned energy giant Equinor had announced that it has entered into a 10-year agreement to sell 2.4 billion cubic metres (bcm) of natural per year – around 14% of Polish annual consumption – to Poland’s state gas firm PGNiG via the Baltic Pipe.\n\nPGNiG, which has booked around 80% of the pipeline’s capacity, said that its own output from the Norwegian shelf – estimated at around 3 bcm this year and 4 bcm annually in coming years – will make up most of the gas transported through the pipe, reports Reuters.\n\nThe Baltic Pipe, construction of which began in 2020, is around 900 kilometres long in total and is being built at a cost of at least €1.6 billion, reports PAP. Around €250 million of that total has been provided by the European Union.\n\nNorway’s Equinor has entered into a 10-year agreement to sell natural gas to Poland that will cover around 15% of Polish annual consumption. The gas will be transported through the new Baltic Pipe, which is due to open next week https://t.co/ZXRdv7uBtP — Notes from Poland 🇵🇱 (@notesfrompoland) September 24, 2022\n\nIn June, it was announced that the longest onshore element of the pipeline, 191-kilometre stretch running across Poland, had been completed ahead of schedule. The following month, Poland’s gas system operator, Gaz-System, revealed that the pipeline had been connected to the Polish and Danish transmission systems.\n\nThe pipeline is part of Poland’s long-running efforts to diversify away from Russian energy supplies. That included the opening of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Świnoujście in 2015 and another planned floating LNG terminal in Gdańsk.\n\nAfter Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Polish government accelerated such efforts, announcing that it would end all Russian energy imports this year. Subsequently, in April, Russia’s Gazprom cut off its supply of gas to Poland after Warsaw refused its demand to pay in roubles.\n\nMain image credit: Gaz-System press materials",

    "Poland condemns EU chief von der Leyen’s “scandalous, anti-democratic” remarks": "Poland’s ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party has condemned the “scandalous” remarks this week by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen about Poland, Hungary and Italy. It says they are further evidence of the EU’s “anti-democratic” interference in the domestic politics of member states.\n\nIn a speech at Princeton University, von der Leyen addressed concerns over the national-conservative governments in Budapest and Warsaw – which have regularly clashed with Brussels over the rule of law – and the potential victory of hard-right parties in Italy’s upcoming election.\n\n“If things go in a difficult direction [in Italy] – and I’ve spoken about Hungary and Poland – we have tools [to deal with it],” said the commission president.\n\nShe also referred to Poland more specifically, saying that the government there “does not want to change laws in the way we have [agreed] to restore the independence of the judiciary”. Therefore the EU “will not disburse any money…[until] they do the reforms agreed upon”.\n\n\"It is now unfolding what I was fearing but was predictable.

Warsaw, however, insists it has met the EU’s demands and that the money is being blocked for political reasons.\n\nSpeaking today to the Polish Press Agency (PAP), Radosław Fogiel, a PiS spokesman, said that von der Leyen’s latest remarks “prove what we as PiS have been saying for a long time: that decisions concerning, for example, the [recovery funds] are purely political”.\n\n“Her speech was full of beautiful words about democracy, but when it comes down to it, it turns out that von der Leyen is openly trying to influence the democratic processes in a democratic state, suggesting that if she does not like Italians’ choice, the right tools – as she put it – will be used,” said Fogiel.\n\n“This is exactly the same anti-democratic point of view presented by the Polish opposition,” he continued. “They adhere to the principle that democracy is great provided that ‘our own’ win.”\n\n“It is clear that this is a group that has completely failed to internalise the principles of democracy and does not understand what it is all about,” Fogiel concluded. “They consider it only a facade that is to legitimise their own governments, and in fact they do not care about the choice of citizens, they do not take it into account.”\n\nFormer foreign minister Witold Waszczykowski, now a PiS MEP, also condemned von der Leyen’s “blackmail and interference in the democratic process”. He warned that they would further turn Italians against EU institutions and encourage more of them to “vote for parties that defend sovereignty”.\n\n“In the long run, it could be even worse,” Waszczykowski told PAP. “If another state is stigmatised and [targeted] with instruments beyond European law, it may come to the conclusion that it will be more comfortable outside the EU. The UK, apart from a temporary period of problems, has suffered no harm. It shows that there is life outside the EU.”\n\nPiS has in recent years sought to build closer ties with other right-wing and far-right eurosceptic parties in the EU, including Italy’s Lega and Brothers of Italy parties, which are expected to do well in the upcoming elections.\n\nThe grouping – which also includes France’s Marine Le Pen – say they want to create an EU in which member states have more power and European institutions have less.\n\nSince Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, however, such efforts have been put on hold, publicly at least, given that those parties’ generally sympathetic position towards the Kremlin is at odds with PiS’s strongly anti-Russian line.\n\nMain image credit: © European Union 2022 – Source: EP (under CC BY 4.0)",
    "Poland turns away Russians at border": "Poland has refused entry to dozens of Russians trying to cross its land borders, saying they “may be dangerous to our country”. A particularly large number sought to enter on Wednesday and Thursday, after Vladimir Putin announced a partial mobilisation and many Russians consequently sought to flee the country.\n\nOn Monday, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia introduced new restrictions preventing the entry of most Russians. Previously, those four countries – all of which share land borders with Russia – had been the entry point for around two thirds of the million Russians who have entered the EU by land since Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking to the Polish Press Agency, Polish border guard spokeswoman Anna Michalska said that over the following days 54 Russians had been refused entry: two on Monday, nine on Tuesday, 17 on Wednesday and 26 on Thursday.\n\nHowever, between Monday and Friday 1,770 Russians were admitted to Poland while 2,342 left, reports PAP. Poland and the Baltic states’ new entry restrictions make exceptions for certain categories of Russians, including “dissidents”, “humanitarian cases”, family members and holders of residence permits in EU countries.\n\nSince Putin announced the partial mobilisation, some have suggested that Poland and the Baltic states should allow entry to Russians seeking to avoid military service.\n\nHowever, on Friday Stanisław Żaryn, the spokesman for Poland’s security services, rejected the idea. “We absolutely should not admit such people en masse,” he said, quoted by RMF24. “These are people who may be dangerous to our country.”\n\n“We do not have reliable information showing that these people want to flee because they are rebelling against the Russian government,” added Żaryn. “These people probably want to flee because they are afraid of the individual situation related to being drafted into the army.”\n\nA similar position has been taken by the Baltic states.

China is willing to steadily advance the cooperation between China and Central and Eastern European Countries (CEEC) on top of deepening bilateral cooperation. Poland is a major country in Central and Eastern Europe and an important initiator of China-CEEC cooperation. China supports Poland in building a CEEC wholesale market for agricultural products and making it a regional distribution center for agricultural products.\n\nRau expressed that Poland views China as a friendly and reliable strategic partner, and the two countries have maintained close high-level interactions and exchanges at various levels. The two sides share common views on safeguarding independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. Poland adheres to the one-China policy and appreciates China's consistent pursuit of a foreign policy of peace. Poland is committed to advancing China-CEEC cooperation and is ready to strengthen cooperation in agricultural product trade with China. Poland attaches importance to China's international status and influence and hopes that China will play an important role in restoring peace in Europe.\n\nWang Yi said, a magnified and prolonged Ukraine crisis serves no one's interests. Hope the conflict will end as soon as possible and peace talks could resume.

    "Poland ‘hiding’ from spyware inquiry, EU lawmakers warn": "Poland's leading politician Jarosław Kaczyński confirmed the government has the Pegasus hacking software, but the government denied it had been used against opposing politicians | Wojtek Radwanski/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe Polish government on Wednesday faced pressure from EU officials to come clean on how it used spyware for political purposes.\n\nA delegation of members of the European Parliament met with officials of the Polish parliament — the Sejm — and other institutions this week. But the delegation got stonewalled by the government, who declined the committee's invitations to meet.\n\nThe group of EU lawmakers said the government is “hiding behind national security provisions” in its defense of using the Pegasus spyware to surveil opponents in the lead-up to the 2019 election, the head of the delegation and Dutch center-right lawmaker Jeroen Lenaers told reporters at the end of the visit.\n\nThere is no realistic scenario in which “national security requires you to use highly invasive spyware such as Pegasus against opposition politicians, against prosecutors, against lawyers,” Lenaers said.\n\nPoland is one of four countries, together with Hungary, Spain and Greece, where reports on the use of hacking software against political opposition figures, members of civil society and journalists have sparked political crises and investigations — in a series of scandals resembling the Watergate political-espionage scandal that rocked U.S. politics in the 1970s.\n\nPoland's leading politician Jarosław Kaczyński, who chairs the ruling Law and Justice (PiS), previously confirmed the government has the Pegasus hacking software, but the government has denied it had been used against opposition politicians in the 2019 parliamentary election campaign.\n\nLenaers said the government's move to decline meetings with his delegation was “a telling sign of the complete lack of importance this government attaches to checks and balances, to democratic scrutiny and to dialogue with elected representatives.”\n\nThe European Parliament is running an inquiry as part of its special committee investigating the use of the Israeli-made Pegasus software and similar hacking tools by European governments.\n\nThe chamber also wants the European Commission to step in, pressing EU member countries to ensure civil rights and implement privacy protections when using hacking tools as part of investigations and intelligence work.\n\nSophie in 't Veld, a Dutch Liberal lawmaker working on a Parliament report to impose stricter rules, said the European Commission needs “to let go of its ‘none of my business, see no evil, hear no evil’ attitude.”\n\nIn comments to a group of POLITICO reporters on Wednesday, European Justice Commissioner Didier Reyners defended the EU executive's action. His services have \"sent letters to four member states\" asking for clarity on the reported allegations, he said. Poland, Hungary and Greece have responded to the Commission's questions, while Reynders himself will visit Spain next week and said he would press the government for answers too.\n\n\"We are very open [about the fact that] we think about a possible piece of legislation, or action at the European level\" to \"be sure that there are real safeguards and protections,\" Reynders said.\n\nBut, he added, \"we need to be sure that we have the real competence to do this.\"\n\nVincent Manancourt contributed reporting.",
    "Ambassador Mark Brzezinski’s Remarks about “The Role of Poland in NATO Eastern Flank Security”": "Hotel Bellotto\n\n20 September 2022\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you Deputy Marshall Włodzimierz Czarzasty for proposing this event and inviting me. And thank you to the Bronislaw Komorowski Institute and the Amicus Europae Foundation for organizing.\n\nIt’s an honor to be with you, standing alongside the founding fathers of Poland’s NATO membership.\n\nPresident Kwasniewski, President Komorowski, Ambassador Koźmiński, it is you that we are celebrating on this occasion. Poland is safe and has become an integral part of our shared security, because you knew the value of joining the most powerful collective defense organization in history.\n\nStatesmen, diplomats, and esteemed members of the audience, all of you played a role and still to do to this day. The solemn obligation NATO members make when they join the alliance doesn’t just end when you’re admitted. It takes constant work and requires great sacrifice.\n\nPresident Biden knew that Poland was up for this pledge. As a Senator he led the fight for Poland’s admission into NATO. Former United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright did too.\n\nHer crowning diplomatic achievement was helping to bring Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary into NATO. Secretary Albright passed away a few months ago. But her legacy lives on through the alliance that she modernized and expanded.\n\nWhen Poland joined NATO over two decades ago, the challenges we faced were different. NATO has had to evolve to meet the threats of the 21st century. It’s been Poland on the frontline of these changes.\n\nIn 2016, during NATO’s Warsaw Summit, member countries responded to Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea by deploying four multinational combat battalions to Poland and the three Baltic States. This represented a shift from ‘assurance’ to ‘deterrence and defense’ and some of the largest NATO deployments since the end of the Cold War.\n\nAnd when Russia began its brutal, full-scale further assault on Ukraine in February, Poland, the US, and individual member countries immediately responded by providing support that has fueled Ukraine’s latest push back against Russian forces.\n\nLast week, Ukrainians retook more than six-thousand square kilometers from Russian control in September. Putin’s plan is failing.\n\nWhile we have done so much to support Ukraine, it’s Poland that has truly risen to the moment. Poland’s rapid mobilization has inspired the world.\n\nWhat Poland and its people have done is akin to America’s response to the attack on Pearl Harbor or the Cold War era-space race. It’s reminiscent of the unstoppable spirit of brave Poles during the Warsaw Uprising and the Solidarity movement.\n\nWhen millions of people crossed the Polish borders, you welcomed refugees with open arms. You provided hope and stability for Ukrainian families who had lost everything.\n\nThis is a very important point so I want to convey it in Polish language:\n\nPolska ma wiele mocnych stron.\n\nPolska ma silną gospodarkę.\n\nPolska ma potencjał innowacyjności.\n\nTeraz zobaczyliśmy jeszcze: zdolność do szybkiej reakcji całego społeczeństwa i mobilizacji.\n\nTo znaczy: czasami kryzys może opóźnić reakcję.\n\nAle nie w Polsce. Tutaj w lutym mogliśmy zobaczyć zdolność do szybkiej mobilizacji całego społeczeństwa.\n\nAmeryka miała podobne doświadczenia:\n\nAtak na Pearl Harbor zmobilizował Amerykanów do szybkiego działania w przemyśle wojskowym.\n\nDrugi przykład, to: Lot na Księżyc w 1969 r. spowodował ogromny rozwój technologiczny.\n\nKryzys na Ukraine spowodował ogromną mobilizację w Polsce.\n\nTo daje nadzieję na głębokie zmiany.\n\nAnd it’s Poland that continues to help the United States and our allies and partners in getting Ukraine the supplies it needs.\n\nPoland has also sent $1.8 billion in military aid to Ukraine. You donated many tanks. You sent artillery and ammunition.\n\nPoland has become a military, economic, and humanitarian hub for Ukraine.\n\nAt the same time Poland has been busy shoring up its defense modernization program at lighting fast speed. Billions of dollars are being deployed to purchase trusted U.S. military equipment, Abrams tanks, Patriots, HIMARS, F-35s, and the latest announcement – nearly 100 Apache Helicopters.\n\nIf Russian tanks threaten an inch of NATO territory, those Apache helicopters will stop them in their tracks. Apache helicopters are an armored vehicles worst nightmare. They are tank killers.\n\nThis equipment ensures U.S., Polish, and NATO troops can mesh and train together. It allows our soldiers to work as one.\n\nFurthering that cooperation is the establishment of a permanent U.S. Forward Command Headquarters in Poznan, now appropriately named “Camp Kosciuszko”. A first for the United States in Poland. A first for us in Central Europe.\n\nThis is permanent: it’s a historic tectonic shift. V Corps will coordinate all our land forces in Europe, bringing together any and all capabilities necessary to defend Poland and our NATO Allies.\n\nAdditionally, at the NATO Summit in Madrid, President Biden announced more commitments to bolster European security. This includes the establishment of a support Army garrison headquarters in Poznan, along with a field support battalion in Powidz which will maintain U.S. Armored Brigade Combat Team’s worth of equipment. All here on Polish land on a permanent basis.\n\nAnd that’s not all. Together we are building more than 100 military infrastructure projects in Poland. These support U.S. troops rotating through Poland, provide additional locations to hold joint training exercises, and allow the United States and NATO to even more quickly flow forces to Poland in the event of a crisis.\n\nPoland also showed great foresight working to secure its energy security. The United States stands ready to be a secure supplier of civilian nuclear energy. By selecting U.S. technology, Poland would make another key strategic decision to safeguard its energy security for the century ahead.\n\nI tell you all of this because of the message it sends – that we are together and ready for anything. When it comes to helping Ukraine defend itself, when it comes to making sure that there’s significant pressure on Russia to end this aggression, we are united. It’s our greatest strength.\n\nAnd the anchor for it all – those NATO accession talks twenty-five years ago.\n\nI lived here before Poland was a member of NATO. In the early 1990’s, I was a Fulbright scholar in Warsaw. I remember how things felt back then, the uneasiness. That has changed. Poland is a case study for the benefits of NATO expansion.\n\nPoland is not anxious or nervous. Poland is confident and secure because of NATO. Because we stand together. An attack on one is an attack on us all. Quite simply we have each other’s backs.\n\nAnd now Finland and Sweden will have the same reassurances. I lived in Stockholm for four years, where I had the honor to serve as U.S. Ambassador to Sweden. What an historic shift! The fact that two traditionally non-aligned countries have made the decision to join NATO speaks to the power of collective defense.\n\nIn an almost unanimous vote, the Polish Sejm has backed NATO enlargement to include Finland and Sweden. The United States Senate also overwhelmingly approved Finland and Sweden’s accession into NATO. Bipartisan support, in a day when disagreement and differences can be found at every turn in politics, shows that NATO is something we can all agree on.\n\nAnd just think – Putin thought he would divide us, instead, we have never been more united. NATO is the cornerstone of it all. This brings to life the words President Harry Truman shared in 1949 when the organization was founded. He hoped that NATO “would create a shield against aggression.” And it has. Because for NATO success is gauged not by wars won but by wars that are prevented and stifled.\n\nI can confidently say that in the twenty-two years that Poland has been a full member you have met your obligations and some. It’s no longer about Poland proving it belongs in NATO instead it’s that NATO wouldn’t be what it is without you.\n\nNATO and Poland need each other. The United States of America and Poland need each other. I am working hard every day to ensure that we stay ever closer together.\n\nThank you.",

    "Unlike Ukrainian Refugees, Afghans are Neglected In Poland": "The experience of Afghan families, who have sought asylum in Poland, having fled their country following the Taliban takeover in 2021. They testify to the deficiencies of the current system and its double standards towards refugees of different races, nationalities, or religions.\n\nThe Polish government lacks a sustainable and consistent policy approach toward refugees seeking to start their new lives in Poland.\n\nProjections for 2022, beyond the war in Ukraine and the economic crisis, now begin to take notice of an immense increase in new migrants crossing over to Europe — often illegally.\n\nEditor’s Pick: Central Europe’s Religious Right Emboldened by America’s Turn on Abortion\n\nHence, considering the record high number of Ukrainians in the country, the Polish migration and integration policies should take precedence for incorporating and drawing on voices from civil society specialists and refugees themselves.\n\n‘Double Standard’ Approach to Refugees\n\nSince the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Poland has seen an influx of refugees on an unprecedented scale – approximately 6.1 million refugees from Ukraine have crossed the border, of which at least 1.3 million remained in Poland. UNHCR estimates that by December 2022, the population of refugees from Ukraine remaining in Poland will reach 2.6 million.\n\nThe influx of Ukrainian refugees has since become one of the key topics of the public debate in Poland and, in an unprecedented way, mobilised the Polish government and civil society institutions.\n\nHowever, the mobilisation of the Polish government and civil society in support of the Ukrainian refugees has not produced a trickle-down effect on the situation of other refugees, asylum seekers, and migrants seeking to call Poland their new home.\n\nIn addition to not having offered appropriate support to refugees from other countries,\n\nthe Polish government has built a fence on the Poland-Belarus border and since July 2021, has unlawfully pushed the migrants and asylum seekers from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Yemen, Afghanistan, and Cuba back to Belarus, condemning them to life-threatening conditions.\n\nIn July 2022, Felipe Gonzáles Morales, Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants of the UN Human Rights Council, praised Poland’s welcoming approach toward the Ukrainian refugees in a statement concluding his visit to Poland and Belarus. However, in the same statement, Morales called out the Polish government’s ‘double standard approach’ toward migrants, asylum seekers, and refugees from other countries of origin.\n\nIn particular, Morales criticised the Polish government’s lack of appropriate assistance for third-country nationals and refugees with irregular migratory status, expressed his concern over the situation of migrants stranded at the Polish and Belarusian border, and the detention of the migrants who came through Belarus in closed immigration facilities.\n\nAfghan Refugees in Poland\n\nOne such group, often affected by the double standards that Morales brought up, is a group of Afghan refugees who have fled their country once their lives became endangered following the Taliban takeover and the withdrawal of US and NATO forces from Afghanistan in 2021.\n\nIt is estimated that in August 2021, around 1300-1500 Afghans were evacuated to Poland by the Polish government. According to the statistics provided by Poland’s Office for Foreigners, in 2021, international protection was granted to 750 of them. After Belarusians (1150 applicants), they were the second largest group who sought asylum in Poland in 2021.\n\nBashar, Rahmin, Javid and their families are among that group. Back in Afghanistan, all three of them had some connections to Poland, the Polish government, or the Polish military.\n\nTo all three of them and their friends, the withdrawal of the US and NATO forces from Afghanistan and the Taliban takeover came as a shock, destroying the hope they had for their country and for whose development they had been working.\n\nFollowing the chaotic fall of Kabul and an exhausting multi-day journey to Poland, Bashar, Rahmin, and Javid, and their families spent around five to six months in the Center for Foreigners in Grupa near Grudziądz, waiting for the asylum procedure to be completed. They recall that there were around 180 Afghans or around 38 families who were placed at the Grupa centre together with them.\n\nCurrently, there are nine such centres around Poland, eight of which are located in small villages and away from cities, all housing refugees and migrants seeking asylum in Poland for multiple months.\n\nOut of these 1300-1500 Afghans who arrived in Poland in 2021, it is not clear how many of them stayed in Poland. Many families had left for other EU states, especially if they already had some family connections there. However, this has likely complicated their legal situation, since according to the Dublin Regulation, the individual’s asylum application should be processed by the first EU country they arrive in. Therefore, many of those who had left Poland last year might be forced to return, a situation which will further complicate and lengthen the legal and integration processes.\n\nIn comparison, in the case of Ukrainian refugees who have come to Poland since February, all the procedures securing them equal access to the Polish labour market, healthcare, right to education and other social benefits had been shortened to two weeks. Additionally, individual citizens who support Ukrainians by hosting them in their homes received monthly financial support from the government.\n\nDifficulties With the New Reality\n\nThere has been a discrepancy between the welcoming approach toward the refugees from Ukraine and the challenges that Afghans trying to start a new life in Poland face.\n\n‘Unfortunately, Polish people are racists. And we had only around 1300 Afghan refugees, in comparison to the three million Ukrainians,’ Joanna Kasprzak Dżyberti, who was coordinating local community help in Suchy Bór, a 1000-people village near Opole in the southwest of Poland, where 80 refugees from Afghanistan were referred to in August 2021.\n\nFrom Kasprzak-Dżyberti’s observations, women from Ukraine who come to Poland are doing well because of the cultural and linguistic similarities. Conversely, for many Afghan women, the cultural and linguistic differences make it hard to navigate their new realities. On top of that, they have to deal with insensitive comments and xenophobia made by Polish people, who lack education in the vein of diversity and inclusion. Kasprzak-Dżyberti recalled instances of doctors making comments such as ‘What’s that rag on your head for’ to the Afghan women seeking medical care.\n\nJavid, who arrived in Poland with his wife, children, sister and mother, has encountered a lot of xenophobic attitudes, in both small towns and big cities.\n\n‘In Grudziądz we had plenty of challenges but generally speaking, we gradually recognised that there is a huge level of racism among Polish people. For example when I’m sitting on a train or a bus, and there is no empty space and people prefer to stand not to sit next to me. Why? When we are passing a group of guys, they are spitting in front of us. This is a racist environment, and it is very hurtful,’ Javid confessed.\n\nSylwia Żulewska, the president of the EMIC foundation that focuses on supporting refugees in Toruń and Bydgoszcz, confirmed that the scale of society’s support of the Ukrainian refugees is incomparably greater. At the same time, she recognised that there were still a lot of people moved by the Afghans’ situation who wanted to help.\n\nRahmin, after having spent a couple of months at the Grupa Centre, has moved to Gdynia together with his family and remains hopeful about their future in Poland. He is very grateful to his Polish friends and volunteers who have been helping him and his family set up their new life in Poland. ‘This environment is better and better for us. The most important thing for me is that my children can go to school,’ he said.\n\nCivil Society’s Key Role in Helping the Refugees\n\nAccording to Sylwia Żylewska from Emic Foundation, a lot has happened in the public awareness in Poland in the context of migrants over the course of the past year. First, the evacuated Afghans in August 2021, then the crisis on the border in Fall 2021, and the Ukrainian refugees in February 2022.\n\nŻulewska recalled that when the Ukraine war happened, the system was working very well, and clerks at municipal offices were working 24/7 to offer the best support to the Ukrainian refugees. Having recognised these efforts, however, she admitted that still the government does not treat all the migrants and refugees equally. The attitude of the government towards refugees and migrants still depends on their nationality, skin colour, and religion.\n\nEven though that increase of public awareness has led to some policy changes, these predominantly concerned Ukrainian nationals, excluding third-country nationals fleeing from the same war, or refugees from other parts of the world seeking asylum in Poland. Therefore, supporting refugees and migrants in Poland relies on the work of NGOs, private donors, individual volunteers, and the readiness of municipal government offices to support refugees.\n\nAiming to fill the gap in the system, Żulewska’s Emic foundation, with the support of volunteers and private donors, has helped the Afghan refugees since they arrived at the refugee centre in Grupa near Grudziądz in August 2021. Emic’s activities include, among many, providing legal advice and life assistance, organizing activities for children, cooperating with the school at the refugee centre, employing an intercultural assistant at the refugee centre, leading language and cultural courses, or finding apartments and linking the refugees to potential employers.\n\nChallenges in the Job Market\n\nAdditionally, the moment when Afghan refugees were leaving the centres, after having been granted asylum, coincided with the sudden influx of Ukrainian refugees in February and March. These circumstances made it particularly difficult for the Afghan refugees to find apartments and jobs since both the housing and job markets were overburdened.\n\nSylwia Żulewska admitted that for highly qualified refugees, such as former military officials, teachers, or people who used to work in banking or aviation in Kabul, it has been hard to find a job that does not require the knowledge of Polish.\n\nJavid, since he moved to Gdynia with his family, has been looking for a job. So far, with no result.\n\nBack in Afghanistan Javid used to work as a marketing and business manager. He has over a decade of experience across multiple industries in Kabul, ranging from media and telecom to banking and aviation, and a degree in business management.\n\nBashar and his family moved to Nowa Iwiczna, a town 20 kilometres away from Warsaw. Since February, he has been working as an IT technician, travelling to different sites around the country. Back in Kabul, he was a manager in the banking industry, responsible for the deployment and management of ATMs, e-commerce, and online services of a big bank.\n\nBashar works way below his qualifications and admits that there were not many possible choices when it came to his job search, especially since most jobs require fluency in Polish. He is trying to learn and attends Polish classes a couple of times per week, yet the language remains a challenge for him. Bashar is also worried about the rising utility and food prices, and the fact that it has been pretty hard to support his big family from just one salary.\n\nRahmin and his family moved to Gdynia from the Center in Grupa in February. There, he was able to find a flat and a job at Gdańsk’s shipyard. He admits that there were not many offers he could choose from due to the language barrier.\n\nCrisis on the Poland-Belarus Border Still Unresolved\n\nAs long as Bashar, Javid, Rahmin, and their families often have to navigate the not-always-so-easy realities of Poland, their situation is still good compared to the situation of many refugees and migrants stranded on the Poland-Belarus border.\n\nIn the UNHCR statement, Felipe Gonzáles Morales called to end the unlawful pushbacks and violence of both Polish and Belarusian forces toward refugees stranded on the Polish-Belarus border. Morales emphasised, in particular, the situation of third-country nationals, who, fleeing the same war, are not protected under the same legal framework as Ukrainian nationals.\n\nMarta Górczyńska, a human rights lawyer who has been monitoring the border situation since its beginnings in the early summer of 2021, and the co-author of a recent Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights report on the Polish-Belarus border refugee crisis admitted that the topic of the refugee and migrant crisis has not been attracting as much attention as a year ago, since the society’s focus has gone to Ukraine.\n\n‘There is no public awareness anymore about this situation taking place, yet the situation at the border is still very dramatic. Once the fence had been built, the government announced that the crisis was over. We [human rights activists] see that it is not over. Every week we are getting even 100-150 requests for help from people who are stuck in the forest,’ said Górczyńska.\n\nThese requests for help, Górczynska said, concern the most basic assistance, such as food or medical help. Górczyńska emphasised that without volunteers, such as doctors or local people who walk around the forests on the border, offering their support to the people there, the number of deaths would have been significantly higher.\n\nThe fact that in the last year, the government has not been able to provide aid to the migrants stranded at the border, and there has been no cooperation with non-governmental or human rights organisations who have been trying to provide aid, leaves human rights activists with not much hope for the situation to get better anytime soon.\n\n‘Because some people are helping, the picture of the whole situation is perhaps less tragic, because it is there, but at what cost? Currently, there is less and less support from society, on which we had been relying on. There is exhaustion, burnout [of the activists] and the increasing criminalisation, meaning the rising number of criminal proceedings against those who try to help,’ said Górczyńska.\n\nPolicy Needs Change\n\nThe focus on the refugees coming to Poland from Ukraine has likely directed the attention of both the public and the government officials away from other refugees and migration-related issues. However, the consequences of such negligence could be fatal. Especially, as ongoing environmental, technological, and geopolitical transformations will likely contribute to increased migration and displacement of people in the next few years. Already the past year’s events have significantly changed Poland in terms of migrants’ and refugees’ numbers.\n\n‘There should be a policy document, a strategy, and we still do not have this kind of document regarding people who come to Poland. For many years nothing has changed in the system, even the funds for food in refugee centres have been the same for years, despite rising food prices,’ Kasprzak-Dżyberti said when asked about what changes should be made at the policy level, to make refugees’ transition to the Polish reality easier. The existing conditions lead to situations, such as ones in the Podkowa Leśna and Dębak centres, where Afghan refugees, trying to alleviate their hunger, ate poisonous wild mushrooms, leading to the death of two Afghan children.\n\nMigration and asylum policy should be a field that the Polish government actively works on. First, strategic policy on integration and inclusion needs to be drafted and shaped in partnership and consultations with civil society organizations, human rights lawyers, and refugees and migrants themselves.\n\nThis is particularly urgent as the rising utility and food prices will likely put a lot of migrants and refugees in a more vulnerable spot in the coming months. Additionally, the 1-year integration programme that provides the Afghan refugees with basic social benefits, will end in the coming winter.\n\nBashar, for example, recommended the integration programme be extended to two years. He believes that the situation will become very hard for many Afghan families he knows, especially since not all of them have been able to enter the job market.\n\nSecond, consultations with Afghan refugees should be organised, aiming to put their professional skills to the best use. As Bashar explained: ‘We want to work. We want to work for the development of Poland. We don’t like to take social benefits and stay at home, we are professional people with a lot of experience and we want to get new experience in the Polish market.’\n\nThird, the Polish government should address its failure to provide humanitarian assistance to asylum seekers and migrants stranded in the woods on the Poland-Belarus border, as has been repeatedly pointed out by human rights activists, international organisations, and the EU institutions.\n\nFourth, Poland is in dire need of system-wide changes and mechanisms to ensure equal treatment of refugees in migrants in a variety of social contexts. Society needs intercultural education and campaigns promoting equality and inclusion need to be launched, recognizing that Afghan refugees should be valued in Poland.\n\nAs Javid said, ‘Diversity is playing a key role in all nations’ development.’\n\n—\n\nThis media content has been prepared in cooperation with NGO Mondo in the framework of the project ‘I Am European: Migration Stories & Facts for the 21st Century’ funded by the European Union, Estonian Ministry of Culture, National Foundation of Civil Society and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Estonia from the funds of development cooperation and humanitarian aid.

    "Refugees from Ukraine in Poland - Profiling Update, July 2022 - Poland": "INTRODUCTION\n\nMore than 7.1 million refugees from Ukraine have been recorded across Europe. Close to 1.4 million individuals registered for Temporary Protection in Poland as of 12 September 2022, the highest number among the EU countries.\n\nTo understand the demographics of the Ukrainian refugee population, their intentions, immediate needs, access to information and their displacement patterns, UNHCR, in partnership with REACH, launched a region-wide profiling exercise. Interviews were carried out in multiple locations, including border areas, transit and reception centres, collective sites and information and assistance points. While the interviews were conducted in selected locations (i.e. NGO information offices, train and bus stations, reception and transit centers), the results cannot be extrapolated to the population of all refugees from Ukraine residing in Poland and the findings remain indicative. Respondents were randomly selected and asked for their consent to participate in structured interviews using a harmonized regional questionnaire. This update presents results from 3,854 interviews conducted with refugees currently residing in Poland and includes cumulative responses from 1 to 31 July 2022. The approach employed enables for a month to month comparison.\n\nKEY HIGHLIGHTS\n\nAs in June (see here), most of the July respondents plan to stay in Poland.

    "What's behind Poland's reparation debate?": "WARSAW — Ever since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, Poland has received daily threats from Russian propagandists that it will be next. Yet, despite these high stakes, Poland’s Law and Justice (PiS) party government has decided to start a fight with Germany, one of our closest allies, by demanding huge war reparations for the destruction caused by Hitler’s Third Reich.\n\nOn September 1, the anniversary of the outbreak of World War II, PiS Chairman Jarosław Kaczynski presented a report that puts the sum of Poland’s wartime losses at $1.3 trillion. While PiS has been talking about reparations since it came to power seven years ago, this is the first time that it has broached the topic with Germany. In fact, the issue is both formally and morally unambiguous, and the correct policy lies in the opposite direction.\n\nAfter World War II, the Allies decided that injured parties would receive material, rather than financial, reparations. German factories would be dismantled and relocated, or work done by the Germans would benefit the aggrieved states, which were divided into an 18-country “western mass” and an “eastern mass” comprising the Soviet Union and Poland. The eastern mass took its share mainly from the Soviet occupation zone in eastern Germany.\n\nPoland was to receive 15 per cent of this share, and on August 16, 1945, the governments in Warsaw and Moscow signed an agreement to regulate the transfer of reparations. The USSR was to receive up to $10 billion (at 1938 prices), but historians estimate that it eventually took $3-4 billion, about one-third of East Germany’s potential production. By this time, the USSR was also already dismantling and looting assets that had been set aside for Poland under the Potsdam Agreement.\n\nThe Kremlin then imposed a harsh condition on Poland: To receive its due share of German reparations, Poland would have to produce and export its coal to the Soviet Union at an extremely low price. In the event, this arrangement proved to be more costly than the reparations that were coming in. In 1957, Poland agreed to forgo collecting any additional reparations in exchange for ending the ruinous export condition. The allocation of German reparations for Poland had been a sham. Of the $3 billion that the Soviets had collected, in the form of factories, ships, cars, motorcycles, bicycles, and rolling stock, Poland received only $225 million (7.5 per cent).\n\nThen, in December 1970, Poland reaffirmed its renunciation of reparations claims under a new agreement with West Germany, which recognised the Polish border on the Oder and Neisse Rivers, in what had been pre-war Germany. Without this acknowledgement of post-war borders, the very existence of the Polish state would have been called into question.\n\nFormally speaking, then, the question of reparations is closed. Moreover, the Polish constitution makes clear, in Article 241, that “international agreements concluded in accordance with the previous constitutional order, including under the 1952 Constitution of the People’s Republic of Poland, are treated as ratified international agreements with prior consent expressed by law”. Citing the same documents, the German government also considers the subject closed.\n\nTo be sure, Germany does indeed owe a large historic debt to Poland. German aggression in WWII caused unprecedented destruction, including the total destruction of the capital, the erasure of innumerable Polish cultural artifacts, and the deaths of 6 million Polish citizens, including 3 million who were Jewish, a fact that Kaczynski does not bother to mention. Making matters worse, the conclusion of the war forced Poland under the Soviet boot, depriving it of independence and development for the next half-century.\n\nAnyone who visited Poland in 1989 will recall how poor, gray, and ugly the country was after four decades of communism. Traces of this dismal legacy are still ubiquitous today.\n\nOn the other hand, one also must acknowledge that Poland’s economic success over the past three decades would not have been possible without Germany, which was also the most enthusiastic advocate for Poland’s accession to the European Union and NATO. Yes, many Polish banks and companies are owned by entities in Germany, which is thus where the profits go. But such arrangements gave Poles access to the capital they needed to lift their country out of ruin. These mutually beneficial exchanges have fostered a spirit of reconciliation and benevolence between the two countries.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Kaczynski’s demands for reparations have evoked withering criticism everywhere except in the PiS-controlled media. Many see yet another example of the exceptional backwardness of a man who is famous for dwelling in the past. But Kaczynski apparently believes that issuing such demands will improve PiS’s position ahead of next year’s general election. And, of course, raising the issue now is a helpful distraction from the government’s struggle against rampant inflation, now over 16 per cent, and sky-high energy prices.\n\nStill, Kaczynski has let the genie out of the bottle. On September 14, the Sejm (parliament) adopted a resolution, signed even by most opposition MPs, calling on Germany to pay compensation. There are two fundamental differences. First, there is no talk of reparations (formally unobtainable), but of compensation for losses. Second, the resolution was supported by the opposition, including Donald Tusk’s liberal Civic Platform and the Left, led by Adrian Zandberg, who said that “only a teaspoon was left of his family’s property”. As a Civic Platform MP explained, “A new Polish government will be formed next year to handle these matters properly.”\n\nKaczynski doubtless was hoping that the opposition would renounce all Polish claims to reparations. By apparently joining the bandwagon, Civic Platform can undercut his electoral strategy. But this also means that the issue has begun a life separate from and beyond what Kaczynski intended. The outcome is uncertain, but, paradoxically, the best safeguard for Germany may be Kaczynski himself, whose outrageous and legally dubious proposals for resolving such issues cannot be taken seriously.\n\nSławomir Sierakowski, founder of the Krytyka Polityczna movement, is a senior fellow at the German Council on Foreign Relations.

    "Poland will not receive EU funds if its judiciary remains unchanged: EC head": "The President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said that Poland will not receive any money from the National Reconstruction Plan unless it restores independence of its judiciary during a debate on Thursday at Princeton University.\n\nThe EC chief was asked about the money allocated for Poland from the Next Generation EU fund and what actions the EU can introduce to help Polish citizens get rid of the current “undemocratic” government. The woman asking the question also stated that she was grateful to the European Union for not giving any money to Poland as she sees this helping in next year’s elections.\n\n\n\nAnswering the question Ursula von der Leyen thanked for the opportunity to clarify the commission’s stance toward Poland and Hungary.\n\n\n\nShe stated that the problem the European Commission sees with the Polish government is “that we (the EC) are deeply convinced that the independence of the judiciary is no more given.”\n\n\n\nMs von der Leyen also claimed that the European Commission cannot change the Polish government, as this is a task for Polish citizens, “but we (the EC) have to protect the rule of law in Poland”.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can the EC “help” Polish citizens\n\nSpeaking 2 days ahead of the Italian election, Ursula von der Leyen, commented on the prospect of a Meloni-Salvini government:\n\n\n\n“If things go in the difficult direction in Italy… I have spoken about Hungary and Poland earlier. The European Commission has the tools needed”. pic.twitter.com/4U3d9X9FB7 — Visegrád 24 (@visegrad24) September 23, 2022\n\nCompliance is key\n\nThe Polish-EC dispute\n\n“What are we able to do? We are able to do, what we are doing, but they take time,” The EC head said referring to possible actions the commission is able to introduce, to force the hand of the Polish government.In regards to the National Reconstruction Plan (money intended for Poland from the Next Generation EU fund), the EC chief stated that the money “is in principle coupled to reforms the member state has to do”. She pointed out that there is a contract between member states and the EC, “if you do this reform you get reimbursed this amount of money”.According to the EC head, Poland has to comply with aand only after it has done so the EC will “disperse the money”.“We closed the contract. People were partially not happy that we closed the contract, but it is now unfolding what I was fearing, what was predictable, the Polish government does not want to change the laws in the way we have laid it down in the contract, to restore the independence of the judiciary. Therefore we cannot disperse any kind of money,” said Ursula von der Leyen.Moreover, she stressed that Poland is conflating this issue of the money from the National Reconstruction Plan (KPO) with the help they are providing to Ukrainian refugees, claiming that the Polish government is “mixing two things that have nothing to do with each other”.And lastly, she compared this situation in Poland with the dispute the EC presently has with Hungary, saying the main problem in Hungary is corruption.On July 15 2021, the CJEU ruled that the system of disciplinary liability of judges in Poland is not consistent with EU law.\n\nIn mid-August the Polish government responded to the EC regarding the Disciplinary Chamber, stating that Poland would continue its judiciary’s reforms, and furthermore address the issue of judges’ responsibility. The Council of Ministers moreover informed the EC about plans to liquidate the Chamber in its present form.\n\n\n\nIn early June 2022, Poland’s parliament voted in favour of a bill that would replace the disciplinary chamber for judges with a new body, clearing the way for approving Poland's KPO.\n\n\n\nIn turn, the European Council suspended the KPO until Poland agrees to withdraw proposed reforms of its judiciary system, which the EU considers to be too political.\n\n\n\nThe KPO was originally planned for 2021-27 and is worth up to EUR 35.4 bn, which includes EUR 23.9 bn in grants and EUR 11.5 bn in loans.",
    "Tax changes related to employment in Poland from the payer’s perspective": "New regulations that have significantly changed the Polish tax system for the second time in 2022 came into force on July 1. The tax amendment, the so-called Polish Deal 2.0, modifies the personal income tax (PIT) regulations introduced on January 1 2022.\n\nBelow is a summary of the key changes introduced by the Polish Deal 2.0 with regard to the taxation of employment income.\n\nReduced PIT rate\n\nOne of the main changes is the reduction of the lowest PIT rate from 17% to 12%, applicable to income up to PLN 120,000 ($26,000). The change relates to taxpayers settling their taxes under general rules; for example, employees, freelancers, and board members. The new tax scale is to be applied to income for the entire year 2022, whereas tax remitters apply it when calculating advance tax payments on salaries paid from July 1 2022.\n\nAs of January 1 2022, the annual tax-free amount for taxpayers earning income taxed under the general rules was increased to PLN 30,000. Although the tax-free amount remains unchanged, due to the reduction of the lowest tax rate, a new monthly tax-reducing amount is lower and amounts to PLN 300 (PLN 3,600 per year).\n\nElimination of the middle-class relief\n\nWith the entry into force of the Polish Deal 2.0, the middle-class relief was repealed. The relief had been in effect since the beginning of 2022, and applied to employees who fell within the appropriate income limit, both on a monthly and annual basis.\n\nHowever, it was widely criticised due to the complicated algorithms used for its calculation, differing at the monthly and annual calculation stages. Importantly, the elimination of the relief applies to the entire year 2022. Taxpayers can still settle their annual tax for 2022 according to the middle-class relief, if it is more favourable for them.\n\nElimination of double counting of PIT advance payments\n\nWith the introduction of substantial tax changes on January 1 2022, the tax burden of many taxpayers increased significantly. This situation met a fusillade of criticism. To alleviate the situation, the Polish legislator introduced a mechanism of double counting of PIT advance payments.\n\nAccording to the obligation, a tax remitter paying income to employees and freelancers up to PLN 12,800 per month was supposed to calculate advance payments under the rules binding in 2021 and the rules of 2022 and choose the more favourable option for the taxpayer. The Polish Deal 2.0 repeals the obligation of double counting of PIT advance payments.\n\nIncreased remuneration of the tax remitter for timely payment\n\nUntil July 1 2022, the remuneration of the tax remitter for the timely payment of taxes to the state budget was 0.3% of the amount of the collected taxes. The remuneration of tax remitters calculating monthly tax advances on income taxed according to the tax scale has been increased to 0.6% of the amount of collected taxes.\n\nStatements affecting the calculation of PIT advance payments\n\nThe employer calculates PIT advances using the tax-reducing amount if a PIT-2 statement is delivered by the employee. In response to taxpayers' problems with PIT-2 statements, the legislator has provided a new solution. The taxpayer will be able to submit a PIT-2 statement to a maximum of three tax remitters, indicating that a given tax remitter is entitled to reduce the advance payment by the amount constituting:\n\n1/12 of the tax-reducing amount;\n\n1/24 of the tax-reducing amount; or\n\n1/36 of the tax-reducing amount.\n\nMoreover, the Polish Deal 2.0 will provide for the possibility of applying the tax-reducing amount on a monthly basis to the income of individuals employed under a contract of mandate or contract for specific work. The possibility is reserved only for employees at present.\n\nIn addition, the possibility to submit a request to the tax remitter not to withhold PIT advance payments – which is available, among others, to contractors and persons performing specific works – will be extended to employees. Taxpayers are entitled to submit an application if they expect that their annual income subject to the tax scale taxation will not exceed PLN 30,000.\n\nB2B contracts\n\nAn employment contract is one of the basic forms of employment in Poland. However, employees are increasingly choosing alternative forms of employment.\n\nA B2B contract can be an attractive alternative to the employment contract. This is the trend in the IT sector in Poland, where over a third of the specialists are working under B2B contracts, and paying, in general, lower PIT than employees.\n\nThe Polish Deal 2.0 also introduced many changes for entrepreneurs. One of the main amendments is the possibility of changing the form of taxation of business income (revenue) to the tax scale applied in 2022 during or after the end of the year.\n\nIn addition, the Polish Deal 2.0 introduced a possibility of partial deduction of health contributions, depending on the chosen method of taxation.",
    "Poland’s east depopulates as suburbs grow, census data show": "Eastern Poland has seen population declines over the last decade while areas around large cities have attracted more residents, newly released census data show.\n\nThe figures also show that Wrocław has overtaken Łódź as Poland’s third largest city, while Poland’s total population fell by 1.2% from 2011 to 2021, to 38,036,118 people. The number of areas in which people aged over 65 make up more than 20% of the population increased tenfold.\n\nOf the 2,477 municipalities in Poland, 1,776 had a smaller population in 2021 than a decade earlier. In 1,181, the decline in the population was larger than 5% and in 397 larger than 10%, according to the data published by Statistics Poland (GUS), a state agency, on Tuesday.\n\nThe majority of areas with the largest population declines were in the east, an area that is more rural and historically less economically developed than western parts of the country.\n\n“Most of the municipalities that recorded a large decrease in population (above 10%) are located in the areas of the so-called “eastern wall”,” wrote GUS. “A particular concentration of such municipalities can be found in the Podlaskie region.”\n\nIn Podlaskie almost half of municipalities noted a population decline over the last decade. By contrast, areas around large metropolises saw the strongest growth.\n\n“The highest population growth was mainly observed in municipalities located in the immediate vicinity of the largest urban centres, which is a result of the appeal of the large agglomerations as attractive labour markets,” said GUS, adding that the expansion of suburbs was also observed in medium-sized cities.\n\nAt the same time, the proportion of municipalities where the percentage of people aged 65 and over was higher than 20% increased significantly throughout Poland, but especially in eastern Poland.\n\nIn 2011, there were only 51 such municipalities in Poland, or 2% of all municipalities in the country. In 2021, the number of municipalities with a share of older people exceeding 20% had increased tenfold, and they already accounted for more than one fifth of all municipalities in in Poland\n\n“The ageing of the population is clearly evident,” said GUS’s president Dominik Rozkrut, quoted by news portal Money.pl. “The young are leaving, the old are getting older. This poses a major challenge for social policy.”\n\nIn the cities themselves, however, the population declined. Of the 37 cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants, only eight saw a population growth: Zielona Góra, Warsaw, Rzeszów, Wrocław, Kraków, Gdańsk, Opole and Białystok.\n\nThe remaining cities recorded losses, the largest in Katowice and Łódź (a loss of around 8%), followed by Kielce and Bydgoszcz. That decline saw Łódź lose its status as Poland’s third largest city, with its population (now 670,642) dropping below Wrocław’s (which rose to 672,929)\n\nPoland’s two largest cities remain Warsaw (1,8602,81) and Kraków (800,653), while Łódź is followed by Poznań (546,859), Gdańsk (486,022), Szczecin (396,168) and Bydgoszcz (337,666).\n\nMain photo credit: Bartosz Żygadło/Unsplash",

    "Going nuclear: Poland and Hungary on diverging energy paths": "Warsaw, Poland – Debate over the current and future role of nuclear energy has waged for years in Central and Eastern Europe. But since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, this discussion has become a key concern in regional plans for energy independence and security.\n\nFar from leading to a consensual outlook, the war itself has highlighted divided visions on nuclear energy, specifically regarding the role that Russia should play in future developments.\n\nBreaking away from legacy\n\nThe shadow of the Soviet hegemony still looms large in the sphere of nuclear energy across the entire region. Beginning as early as the late 1950’s, the USSR facilitated the development of nuclear energy within the COMECON group.\n\nOwing to this, many countries in the region today – including the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and Lithuania among others – but with the notable exception of Poland, have inherited Soviet-built nuclear infrastructure. This legacy of Russian technology and design, now administered by the Russian state-corporation Rosatom, has resulted in a continued reliance on Russia for both the maintenance of reactors and the supply of nuclear fuel.\n\nIn the current crisis, this has been a difficult situation to address.\n\nConspicuously, since the Russian invasion of February 2022, Rosatom has avoided the same sanctions applied to other Russia-based energy suppliers such as Gazprom and Lukoil. This is likely a testament to the acute dependency that European reactors still have on Rosatom and will continue to have in the near future if difficult changes are not made.\n\nUltimately, this approach has shifted responsibility to individual countries as to whether they continue to cooperate with Russia.\n\nYet even with these inherent challenges of transition, several countries on the EU’s eastern flank have already demonstrated a willingness to break away from reliance on Russia. In May Finland scrapped plans to cooperate with Rosatom in building a new nuclear plant, Hanhikivi 1, citing the risks of renewed conflict in Ukraine.\n\nSimilarly, in June the Czech Republic, which had already banned Russian tender for future nuclear development, signed a deal with both Westinghouse and France’s Framatome to supply plant fuel, replacing Rosatom.\n\nBut the two opposing cases of Poland and Hungary provide the starkest contrast in terms of how countries in Central Europe can relate to Russian dominance in the field of nuclear energy, either maintaining the status quo or setting a precedent for change.\n\nThe Polish exception\n\nIn 1989 Poland discontinued the construction of what would have been their first nuclear power plant, located in Żarnowiec on the Baltic sea. At the time Soviet influence was rapidly waning, and there was little or no will to continue such a project, in view of both the Chernobyl disaster, only three years prior, and a new energy policy diverging from the interests of what would soon become the Russian Federation.\n\nWhile this decision did ultimately prevent Poland from inheriting a nuclear legacy tied to Russia, it also deprived Poland of experience in the industry. Any future pursuit of this power source would have to work from the ground up. However, this tabula rasa left many options open as the debate around nuclear energy reappeared in following decades.\n\nIn 2014, the Polish Council of Ministers finally approved the first iteration of a long-term “Polish Nuclear Power Program” (PNP), which consolidated many years of strategic thinking to develop the sector. Energy security, and particularly energy independence from Russia, was already a key policy concern in Poland.\n\nThe Polish government is currently entertaining proposals from several foreign energy companies. In October 2021, France’s EDF submitted an offer to build 4 to 6 nuclear reactors in Poland, followed in April 2022 by a similar offer from South Korea’s KHNP and in September by the US’s Westinghouse and Bechtel. Once the final selection is made this autumn, the first plant is set to be operational by 2033, located in the Choczewo municipality of Lubiatowo-Kopalino.\n\nThe plan in its current state still faces hurdles. One notable development this summer has been the dismissal of Poland’s longtime “energy czar” and government plenipotentiary for strategic energy infrastructure Piotr Naimski. This has been largely taken as a sign of PiS party/government infighting, and a potential reshuffle of the government’s long-term strategy.\n\nThe highly ambitious schedule presented in the Polish Nuclear Power Program has also been criticized for its proposed 2033 launch date, which some say is unrealistic. That notwithstanding, Poland has made great strides in developing nuclear energy without relying on the Russian backing, which has been standard in the region for decades.\n\nHungary: by design or fait accompli\n\nIn contrast to Poland, Hungary has had a long history of nuclear development going back all the way to the 1950’s with their first research reactor coming online in 1959. At the time further progress in this sector necessitated cooperation with the Soviet Union.\n\nIn the 1960’s Hungary entered into an agreement with the USSR to build a nuclear power plant in Paks, 100 km south of Budapest. As with other countries in the former Eastern bloc, Hungary’s nuclear capacity became based on Soviet design and technology which, in itself, makes energy independence a more difficult and costly task.\n\nThis process resulted in the construction of four nuclear reactors at the Paks site with all four coming online between 1982 and 1987. Initially these reactors were designed with a 30-year operating lifetime, after which they would be due for replacement. This would have meant that they would all be replaced between 2012 and 2017.\n\nHowever, in 2005, the Hungarian parliament voted to further extend the operating lifetime of the reactors by 20 years, an extended deadline for replacement Hungary is nevertheless rapidly approaching. And while due diligence has been taken with regard to safety, relying on 50-year-old Soviet infrastructure will undoubtedly raise concerns.\n\nTo address this issue the Hungarian government began an open tender after 2010 in which several companies from the US, France and South Korea expressed interest. Even then Rosatom was a strong contender, which was further highlighted by Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban’s growing relationship with Russia’s Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn 2014, this special relationship became all too apparent as the project (which would be Paks II) was suddenly awarded to Rosatom without competition. In a follow-up, Russia agreed to finance 80% of the roughly $ 12 billion construction cost, in a move that has been called an overt purchase of political influence. Highly controversial, this decision set the stage for future rapprochement between Hungary and Russia, the effects of which are all too clear today.\n\nHungary has recently rejected demands to sanction Russia and continued to work with Russia on Paks II, with the opening of construction being announced as recently as August 2022. For Hungary the die is cast.\n\nFor Hungary, the large political and financial investment that Orban’s regime has made into Russian-built nuclear energy, and the time constraints posed by aging nuclear infrastructure, may shed some light on why Hungary has gone to such lengths to preserve its relationship with Moscow in the face of broad condemnation.\n\nFor Poland, independence from Russian nuclear infrastructure has given the country a unique opportunity to direct its own capacities and develop agreements on freer terms. The next months will show which company wins the tender for the Polish nuclear infrastructure.\n\nAs close as Hungary and Poland may have been in a number of areas, their approach to nuclear energy underlines a fundamental disagreement between the two. Embodying two distinct trajectories of nuclear development, they will likely serve as an indicator of changing times for nuclear energy.\n\nBy Nathan Alan-Lee\n\nNathan is a research assistant working with the Jagiellonian University in Krakow and a PhD student at the UCL School of Slavonic and East European Studies.

    "Strong Dutch presence at the New Mobility Congress in Łódź, Poland": "Strong Dutch presence at the New Mobility Congress in Łódź, Poland\n\nFrom 12 to 14 September, a business delegation of 12 companies from the Netherlands participated in the New Mobility Congress 2022.\n\nNMC2002\n\nThis year’s edition, the third and most successful one so far, took place in the fantastically renovated EC1 in Łódż and offered a three-day programme on a wide variety of topics, with 81 panels and 241 speakers from all over Europe. The event was organized by the Polish Alternative Fuels Association (PSPA) and hosted a record number of 1598 participants, becoming the largest-scale trade event on sustainable mobility in Poland. It effectively brought together all relevant players in the Polish mobility sector, including the automotive industry, transport companies, providers of mobility services, companies developing electromobility and policymakers from the public sector. The Netherlands’ ambassador to Poland, Daphne Bergsma, officially opened the congress, together with other dignatories, among which the mayor of Łódż, Hanna Zdanowska.\n\nDutch footprint\n\nSeizing the occasion of the NMC, the Netherlands Embassy in Poland decided to offer an \"Exhibition Participation Package\" for the Dutch private sector, under the Support for International Business Programme of the RVO, the aim being to introduce or position Dutch business in the fastly growing Polish mobility sector. The group of company representatives from the Netherlands that applied for the package turned out to be very diverse in background, scale, branch, interest and experience in Poland, resulting in serendipitous exchanges and a remarkably good vibe. We had small and large companies on board, involved in charging infrastructure (Alfen, Fastned, Volt Time, CV Charging Europe), smart energy and mobility solutions (Brenergie, LastMileSolutions), lease (Leaseplan), automotive (DAF Trucks), energy storage (e-ATEPS, StoragePartners), IT-solutions (Sourceful) and a venture capital fund (Urban Impact Ventures).\n\nActivities and visibility\n\nA total of 73 match-making meetings were held, with the invaluable suppport of Elro van den Burg of the Netherlands Polish Chamber of Commerce (NPCC). An other meet&greet-moment was the networking event hosted by the Embassy. Just before the congress, PSPA recorded a podcast in which a number of the Dutch companies presented themselves and the Economic Counsellor of the Netherlands Embassy, Sanne Kaasjager, reflected on developments and opportunities in Polish mobility. A special market survey “Poland Drives e-Mobility 2022”, commissioned by RVO and written by PSPA, provided the basis for that reflection and was also officially presented at the NMC2022. Many of the Dutch business representatives took active part in various panels. Michiel Langezaal, CEO of FastNed, made a keynote speech in the main hall. Herman Sips, representative of the Dutch ministry of Infrastructure and Water, responsible for the campaign to promote the Global MoU on electrification of heavy transport, contributed online in a highly interesting panel with representatives of leading e-truck manufacturers. The centrally-located NL Pavilion did its work by providing a “poster” for the Dutch brands and a lively meeting point. Visitors could also put on special Virtual Reality glasses with 3D-presentations of various Dutch sectors. A total of 54 people seized this new way of visualizing Dutch products and services way of doing business (and sometimes a little seasick). The abundantly present Polish media conducted 6 TV interviews with business and embassy representatives, increasing the Dutch visibility even more.\n\nOpportunities and potential areas for Dutch-Polish cooperation\n\nSo, what are the most potential areas for cooperation and growth? The analists of PSPA concluded that for Dutch investors and providers there are four areas to look at with particular interest: electrification of heavy transport, expansion of a public and private charging infrastructure, lithium-ion battery production and mobility-as-a-service. All Dutch participants where positively surprised by the potential of the Polish market and indicated a clear interest to come back next year. The Netherlands Embassy thanks all involved, especially the NPCC, RVO, the ministry of Infrastructure & Water, and especially the representatives of the Dutch companies for their interest and enthousiastic contributions.",

    "Poland prepares potassium iodide tablets for distribution in case of nuclear disaster in Ukraine": "Poland’s government has provided fire departments across the country with potassium iodide tablets that can be distributed in the case of a radiation emergency. The decision was made amid concerns over the security of nuclear power plants in neighbouring Ukraine.\n\n“This is a standard procedure, provided for by law and applied in the event of a possible radiation hazard,” announced the interior ministry. “At the same time, we would like to inform you that at the present time there is no such threat and the situation is continuously monitored by the National Atomic Energy Agency.”\n\nThe ministry assured that “the services responsible for state security are on constant alert, and an adequate amount of potassium iodide is secured for every citizen of Poland”.\n\nIn the event of confirmed contamination, plans would go into motion to distribute the potassium iodide tablets, which help prevent the absorption of radioactive iodine by the thyroid gland. After the Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine in 1986, the Polish authorities also administered iodide to millions of citizens, in particular children.\n\nIn March this year, Russian forces captured the Zaporizhzhia power station in Ukraine, which is Europe’s largest nuclear plant. Since then, there have been concerns over the upkeep of the facility as well as potential damage by continued fighting.\n\nEnerhoatom, the operator of Ukraine’s nuclear power plants, also said that Russia had fired on Ukraine’s second largest nuclear plant, near the city of Yuzhnoukrainsk, overnight on Sunday.\n\nLast night russian terrorists attempted to strike the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant in the Mykolaiv region.

    "Poland to open unfinished waterway in bid to sideline Russia": "A new channel connecting the Vistula Lagoon with the Gulf of Gdańsk is to be launched on Saturday (17 September), even though it is currently unfinished.\n\nThe Vistula Spit canal is to be opened on the anniversary of the Soviet attack on Poland in 1939, which the government will be willing to use as a symbol of the country giving up its dependence on Russia.\n\nWith the canal launch, Poland will break with Russia’s domination in the region, the Polish government insists. Ships will get access to all ports of the Vistula Lagoon, and the seaport in Elbląg, and new development opportunities will open up for Elbląg, Warmia and the whole of Eastern Poland.\n\n“Thanks to the Vistula Spit dug-through, Poland will gain a waterway which connects the Vistula Lagoon with the Baltic Sea and is independent of Russia. The canal will ensure Poland is safe and sovereign,” said the government in a statement, quoted by Money.pl\n\nWhile experts warn that opening an unfinished waterway poses a risk to the vessels that will use it, the opening ceremony organisers have long been looking for a captain who “proves brave enough” to cross the canal first, Wirtualna Polska news portal earlier reported.\n\nEventually, a volunteer was found, according to Business Insider Poland. Zodiak II will be the pioneer in the new waterway.\n\n“I hope it will not come through. Such a demonstrational passage comes with a risk of an image disaster if the barge, sailing along an unmarked route, ran aground,” Daniel Kotur, a captain with 20 years of experience, told Wirtualna Polska.\n\nThe total length of the waterway from the Gulf of Gdańsk through the Vistula Lagoon to Elbląg is almost 23 km.

    "Remarks to Traveling Press Before Departing Poland": "SECRETARY BLINKEN: I just thought I’d say a few words before we head off to Brussels and reflect for a minute about what we did yesterday in Ukraine as well as what we can expect today in Brussels. This was my fifth trip to Ukraine as Secretary and in many ways the most meaningful because it took place coincident with the beginnings of this counteroffensive that Ukraine is engaged in to liberate the land that has been seized by Russian forces as a result of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.\n\nWe had a chance yesterday to hear directly from President Zelenskyy and his team about the state of their efforts in this counteroffensive, and I had an opportunity to share with him and his team additional significant assistance that the United States is providing both in the near term and longer term on the security side – an additional $2.8 billion. This assistance combined with the extraordinary courage and resilience of Ukrainian forces and the Ukrainian people has been the recipe for success thus far in the Ukrainians pushing the Russians back, and now engaging in this counteroffensive.\n\nI told President Zelenskyy on behalf of President Biden and the American people that we have been with Ukraine. We’re with Ukraine today. We will be with Ukraine tomorrow and for however long it takes to deal with Russia’s aggression. And I come away, again, very confident in Ukraine’s future because the Ukrainians are fighting for their homeland. It’s their homeland, not Russia’s.\n\nWe head now to Brussels. I think I’ve spent more time in Brussels than in any other city other than Washington, D.C., these past 18 months or so, and there’s good reason for that. It’s home to the NATO Alliance, the European Union. Allies and partners come together in Brussels to work together on the major challenges of our time; Ukraine now being at the top of the list.\n\nSo, I’ll have an opportunity in Brussels to debrief NATO Allies, other partners, on what I learned in Ukraine and to work with them on a number of issues that are of concern to everyone, starting with the situation in and around Zaporizhzhia, where Russia has seized as part of its aggression a nuclear facility, and that’s of real concern to many of us; making sure that food which needs to get out of Ukraine after it’s been blocked by Russia – make sure the agreement that was reached continues; support for Ukraine, not just security support but economic support and humanitarian support; thinking about longer-term reconstruction needs – all of this is going to be part of the agenda in Brussels.\n\nAnd I think I’ll have a chance to reflect a little bit on what I saw yesterday just in terms of the human toll of Russia’s aggression – seeing kids at the children’s hospital who are victims of that aggression; going to Irpin, a city that was devastated by Russia’s aggression. You see just miles from downtown Kyiv these bombed-out buildings, civilian dwellings. The only thing you can say when you see it is, at best – at best, these were indiscriminate attacks on civilian buildings, and at worst, intentional, deliberate, designed to terrorize the population. It’s important that we remember this, because all of this comes down to the effect it’s having on the lives of real people in Ukraine.\n\nBut finally, the most important reason I think we’re in Brussels is because what has worked so well for us thus far has been our unity – unity of purpose, unity of action. When it comes to helping Ukraine defend itself, when it comes to making sure that there’s significant pressure on Russia to end this aggression, when it comes to making sure our own Alliance is as strong and resolute as it can be to deter any additional Russian aggression, I think you’ll see that unity in action, once again. And I’m confident that based on every conversation I’ve had, every engagement I’ve had, it’s going to continue.\n\nQUESTION: Mr. Secretary, going into the Brussels visit, how concerned are you that the energy challenges facing European countries, including the high prices and the supply challenges, are going to erode the unity that you just mentioned of the anti-Russia coalition and the support of Europeans for what’s happening in Ukraine?\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Look, President Biden said from the start that standing up for what’s at stake with Russia’s aggression against Ukraine was not going to be cost-free. And countries have stepped up. They stepped up because, in the first instance, the aggression on a human level is abhorrent but also because, fundamentally, it’s an aggression against the basic principles of the international system that helped us keep the peace, that helped us maintain security, that allowed countries to grow and move forward. And if we allow this to stand, this aggression to stand with impunity, it opens a Pandora’s box for a world of conflict, for a world of hurt going forward.\n\nBut it comes with costs, but the cost of inaction, of not doing anything, of allowing this to go forward, would be far greater.\n\nNow, when it comes to energy, we have taken and we’re taking significant action to deal with the challenges that exist. The United States has released significant oil from our strategic petroleum reserve. We have redirected liquefied natural gas to Europe to help alleviate some of the challenges that Europe is facing with the reduction in energy coming from Russia. We have a task force with the European Union looking at how we do this effectively not just in the immediate, but for the long term. And of course the fact that Russia has cut off the Nord Stream I pipeline, again, is further evidence that it is so vital strategically for Europe to move away from dependence on Russian energy, because Putin has shown repeatedly that he will use it as a weapon. And it’s not going to stop now.\n\nSo, the challenge is to get through the coming winter. Europe has taken very significant steps to put itself in a position to do that, and I’ll hear more about that later today. And we’re doing everything we can to help. But there’s also a tremendous opportunity born of necessity. The opportunity is finally, once and for all, to move away from this dependence on Russia – to get rid of the chokehold that Russia has on Europe, using energy as a weapon, and to diversify supply, diversify roots, but also do it in a way that addresses the climate challenge.\n\nThis is a real, genuine opportunity. We see decisive action being taken by Europe. And again, from what I’ve seen and heard so far, I’m confident this is moving in a good direction. Is there going to be a cost to this? Is it going to be challenging? Yes, but I think we’re looking at landing in a place where manifestly Europe, the United States, countries around the world will be better off.\n\nSECRETARY BLINKEN: Mr. Secretary, on the offensive in the east and south, what would have to happen? You talked with Mr. – President Zelenskyy. What would have to happen? What would they have to achieve with those offensives for it to make sense to go to the negotiating table, and for the West to support negotiations between Ukraine and Russia?\n\nMR PRICE: That is for Ukraine to decide. That’s for President Zelenskyy, the democratically elected leader of Ukraine, to decide. They have to decide the terms upon which they would want to engage and pursue diplomacy. President Zelenskyy said very clearly that when this ends, it will end with diplomacy, but it takes two to engage in meaningful diplomacy. And one is not – it’s not present and shows no signs of being present, and that’s Russia.\n\nSo, unless and until Russia demonstrates that it’s serious about engaging in diplomacy, there’s not much, alas, to be done. And as to the specific terms, that is up to Ukraine. Their country has been aggressed. Russia has seized territory in southern and eastern Ukraine. It’s Ukraine, it’s not Russia. And ultimately, territory needs to go back to Ukraine. Ukraine’s sovereignty and independence needs to be reaffirmed. I have no doubts with – about that. I think we’ve already seen that Putin’s efforts to erase that sovereignty, to erase that independence, to try to make good on his conviction that Ukraine is not its own country and belongs to Russia – that’s already game over. Putin’s lost on that, but, meanwhile, doing tremendous damage to Ukraine, to lives, to livelihoods. That has to stop.

    "British citizens to retain pre-Brexit local voting rights in Poland": "The Polish government has approved a proposed amendment to the electoral law that will allow British citizens living in Poland to retain the same right to vote and stand in local elections that they had before Brexit.\n\nThe bill, which now passes to parliament, adjusts the law to comply with an agreement between Poland and the United Kingdom on reciprocal voting rights for their citizens signed in 2020, during the transition period after the UK left the European Union.\n\nUnder that agreement, British citizens living in Poland are to be entitled to participate in local elections, meaning that they can both vote and stand as candidates. The last nationwide local elections took place in 2018 and the next ones are due next year, though the ruling party is attempting to delay them until 2024.\n\nThe proposed change to the law means that “UK citizens will be able to participate in municipal council elections and in the elections of mayors on the same terms as citizens of EU member states who are not Polish citizens”, says the Polish prime minister’s office.\n\nAs was the case before Brexit, UK citizens will still not be able to vote in Polish parliamentary or presidential elections unless they also have Polish citizenship. They are also no longer eligible to vote in elections for the European Parliament, a right they previously had as EU citizens living in another member state.\n\nThe 2020 reciprocal agreement commits the UK to likewise give voting rights in local elections to Poles living in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The UK has also negotiated voting agreements with Spain, Portugal, and Luxembourg.\n\nAn estimated 6,500 UK citizens live in Poland. Those resident before the end of 2020 benefited from a simplified procedure to allow them to stay after Brexit. As third-country nationals, new arrivals are only allowed to stay for 90 days within a 180-day period without a visa.\n\nThe number of Polish nationals in the UK, which increased rapidly after Poland’s accession to the EU in 2004, peaked at over a million in 2017, but had dropped to under 700,000 by 2021.\n\nMain image credit: Flickr/UK Government (under CC BY-NC-ND 2.0)",
    "Poland's border wall hasn't stopped the flow of migrants from Belarus": "Katarzyna Wappa comes from the town of Hajnowka in eastern Poland, close to the Belarusian border. Bialowieza Forest is right on her doorstep.\n\nIn September 2021, the English teacher and mother of two noticed that \"something wasn't right\" in the forest. She began seeing figures among the trees: exhausted, emaciated people who were often sick and suffering from hypothermia.\n\nBialowieza Forest, on the border between Poland and Belarus, is an impassable marshland\n\nIt was around this time that the leader of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, began using migrants as a political weapon against the EU. People from Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria who had flown to Belarus were brought to the border and forced to cross illegally into Poland.\n\nWarsaw's response was swift and tough: It deployed police and military units to the region and set up a military exclusion zone to keep out prying eyes.\n\nLocal activists help out\n\nLocal activists, including Wappa, quickly set up a group of willing helpers. They went in search of migrants stranded in the forest and administered first aid. \"We often had to play the role of doctor, lawyer, nurse and even babysitter,\" says Wappa. \"I once carried a dying man out of the forest in my arms. We managed to save him just in time.\" On another occasion, she gave a barefoot refugee a pair of shoes.\n\nWappa was one of the few people involved to show her face — a decision that would have serious consequences. After a report about her was broadcast on television, her Facebook page was flooded with messages of hate. She was vilified by state media and her encounters with the security forces escalated.\n\nClaims of illegal pushbacks\n\n\"I had a sick feeling in my tummy when I saw four masked soldiers running towards me all of a sudden,\" she says of one encounter, the shock still etched in her face. \"On another occasion, my car was stopped by the police. The officers started hammering on the roof with their fists, making a terrible noise. My children started crying. I begged them to stop, but they didn't.\"\n\nPolish human rights activist Katarzyna Wappa near the Polish-Belarusian border\n\n\"We had to hide the rescued refugees from the security forces so that they wouldn't be pushed back across the Belarusian border,\" she tells DW. Although such pushbacksare illegal, they did happen in Poland, says Wappa, who was presented with an award in recognition of her work by the Polish Grand Press Foundation in Gdansk in August 2022.\n\nVilified by the government\n\nThe hatred felt towards her and other human rights activists was stoked by the government in Warsaw. The ruling Law and Justice Party (PiS) has been implementing its right-wing populist agenda without regard to the rule of law or the protection of minorities since its electoral victory in fall 2015.\n\nSince then, the independence of the judiciary has been massively curtailed, abortion rights restricted, LGBTQ people marginalized and insulted, and migrants from the Middle East and Africa labeled as terrorists. While many in Poland support these policies, there are also courageous civil rights activists who are not willing to accept human rights violations.\n\n\"Inhuman policies\"\n\nOne of these activists is lawyer Marta Gorczynska. Ten years ago, she joined the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights in Warsaw. When she saw media reports last fall about Afghan refugees who had been stuck at the Polish-Belarusian border for days without food and water, she set off to see if she could help.\n\nMarta Gorczynska was presented with the Human Rights Prize of the German PRO ASYL Foundation in Frankfurt on 3 September 2022\n\nThe \"Grupa Granica\" (Border Group) was set up in the region around this time. Its aim was to protect migrants who, says Gorczynska, \"had become the victims of the inhuman policies of the governments of Belarus and Poland.\"\n\nFood and a blanket\n\n\"I came to the forest to document human rights violations and provide legal counsel,\" she explains, before adding that it soon became clear that what many refugees needed most was a warm blanket and something to eat.\n\nShe accuses the authorities of refusing to enter into any dialogue with non-governmental organizations. \"Instead,\" she says, \"we are dismissed as traitors and enemies of the fatherland.\"\n\nLoss of life\n\nWhile moments of success are few and far between, grief is ever-present at the border. The authorities say that 16 people have lost their lives there. According to Gorczynska, at least 20 have died, probably many more. \"Who has a right to asylum and who doesn't is a completely different matter,\" she says. \"But we cannot allow people to suffer and die on the border.\"\n\nThe border wall between Poland and Belarus is high, but not high enough to stop desperate migrants\n\nGorczynska was presented with the Human Rights Prize of the German PRO ASYL Foundation in early September 2022.\n\nCatholic Church watching from the sidelines\n\nJakub Kiersnowski is head of the Club of Catholic Intelligentsia (KIK), a respected organization better known for its lectures and meetings with prominent figures than its spectacular campaigns. \"We simply couldn't sit back and do nothing,\" he tells DW. When he called on members to take action; hundreds responded. Within a week, an assistance centre was set up in eastern Poland. Then, on 16 October 2021, the group started work near the border.\n\nKiersnowski makes no bones about his disappointment in the Catholic Church. Although one bishop publicly called on people to help migrants, the Church did not actually get directly involved in any way. Kiersnowski is of the opinion that the Church's inactivity is down to its close ties with the ruling PiS.\n\nCatholic helpers targeted by authorities\n\n\"It's a pity that the men studying for the priesthood did not get involved in our relief effort. Washing a refugee's feet would be a practical application of the Gospel's message,\" he says.\n\nJakub Kiersnowski is head of the respected Club of Catholic Intelligentsia (KIK). He and other members of the organization have been helping migrants at the border since October 2021\n\nMembers of the KIK also experienced the disapproval of the government first hand. In December 2021, the police arrested four volunteers and stormed the KIK's assistance centre. Charges of aiding and abetting illegal immigration were brought but later dropped. In March of this year, a 20-year-old activist was arrested and led away in handcuffs.\n\nWall hasn't stopped migrants\n\nDuring the summer, a 5.5-meter (18-foot) wall was erected along the Polish-Belarusian border. This hasn't stopped several dozen migrants crossing into Poland every day. Human rights activists say that the wall has not solved the problem, but exacerbated it. They have noticed a rising number of refugees with broken arms and legs, injuries they sustained climbing over the wall.\n\nThe activists are already bracing themselves for winter and the misery and dangers it will bring for refugees at the border.\n\nThis article has been translated from German by Aingeal Flanagan",
    "Poland could replace blocked EU funds with loans from Asia, says deputy PM": "If the European Union continues to block billions of euros in funds for Poland as part of its “primitive blackmail” aimed at “forcing a change of government” then Warsaw could seek to replace the money with loans from Asia, says a deputy prime minister.\n\n“We are not responsible for the fact that we have not yet received the funds,” Piotr Gliński told conservative weekly Sieci, referring to around €36 billion in post-pandemic recovery funds for Poland that Brussels has frozen over rule-of-law concerns.\n\n“We have met the conditions, and the money is still blocked,” he added. Warsaw insists it has met the “milestones” agreed with the European Commission to unlock the funds, but Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says that not all the requirements have yet been satisfied.\n\nGliński said that the EU has “deceived us” and that its actions amount to “primitive – no longer disguised – blackmail aimed at forcing a change of government” in Poland, with the money being “blocked for purely political reasons”. Other government figures have made similar accusations in recent weeks.\n\nThe deputy prime minister assured that, even if the European money does not arrive, “we will not abandon the development and investments” that are intended to be funded with it. “Everything written into the National Reconstruction Plan will be implemented regardless.”\n\nGliński noted that the EU’s pandemic recovery programme is being funded by the bloc borrowing money. So, to replace lost funds, Poland could “consider borrowing money elsewhere. Maybe in Asia? If there are possibilities, you have to consider them”, he told Sieci.\n\nThe European Commission notes, however, that by borrowing money on the international markets as a bloc, it is able to secure more favourable rates than most member states could individually.\n\nMain image credit: Michal Osmenda/Wikimedia Commons (under CC BY-SA 2.0)",
    "Thales showcased advanced defence equipment at MSPO in Poland": "Thales showcased advanced defence equipment at MSPO in Poland Share this article\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\nThales, one of the global leaders in the defence industry, participated in the 30th edition of the International Defense Industry Exhibition (MSPO), held September 6-9th in Kielce, Poland. During the anniversary fair, partners of the PGZ-Miecznik Consortium, among them Thales, presented the progress of the Miecznik program. Thales also showed visitors it’s advanced technological solutions, including our Short-Range Air Defence capabilities STARStreak and the Lightweight Multi-role Missile (LMM), plus Thales IFF systems and sonars.\n\nThe MSPO exhibition is a significant European industry event and the third largest defence fair after Paris and London. The stands of several hundred defence companies were visited by more than 10,000 visitors during the event. Very productive conversations were held with both customers and partners, taking advantage of the opportunity to connect with our international delegation of experts from Poland, the UK, France and the Netherlands.\n\nThe Thales pavilion contained an impressive product portfolio - equipment and technologies used by the allied nations across the world, including the combat proven STARStreak and LMM missile systems, which are manufactured by Thales in the UK and were offered to Ukraine by the UK Government to support their air defence efforts. STARStreak is the fastest short-range surface-to-air missile, reaching speeds of Mach 3,5 (roughly 3,000 mph) and is one of the weapons most feared by pilots of armoured fighter jets and helicopters. When fired, it releases three laser-guided sub-munitions, which are directed by the operator to strike the target. In turn, the UK’s Lightweight Multi-role Missile (LMM) weighs just 13 kilograms and achieves a range of up to 8 kilometres, and thanks to its multi-functionality supports military units in defending against air, ground and water attacks.\n\nThales representatives were also present at the Polish Armaments Group's booth and attended a press breakfast at which the PGZ-Miecznik Consortium presented Poland's flagship frigate program for the Polish Navy.\n\n\"Thales, as part of the ‘Team UK’ supported by the UK Government is participating in one of our country's largest naval programs. The company is tasked with providing elements of the Integrated Combat System, including the combat management system. It is a great honour for us to be able to work with such recognized partners as PGZ, Babcock and MBDA. We are pleased to be able to support the project with our experience and know-how in building the defence ecosystem within the North Atlantic Alliance,\" said Marcin Czepinski, Director of Thales' Defense Division in Poland.\n\nThales’ close links with Babcock and MBDA in the delivery of the T31 Frigate to the Royal Navy, coupled with our many years of experience and comprehensive realisation of contracts with many countries has enabled us to offer a low-risk, competitive solution for Miecznik. We will equip the Polish Armed Forces’ new frigates with the integrated combat management system TACTICOS. This is a strategic program for Poland, which will significantly strengthen and improve the country's defence capabilities, bring opportunities for Polish Industry in through life support and increase interoperability with close allies.\n\n\"At Thales, we rely on long-term cooperation with local companies and building longstanding partnerships based on the exchange of experience and multi-level transfer of knowledge and competence, which is why we are pleased that this year's MSPO fair was so productive in meetings with our partners and customers. We have agreed on a further course of action through which we will work together for the benefit of the Polish defence industry emphasized Magdalena Nizik, CEO of Thales Poland.\n\nAbout Thales\n\nThales (Euronext Paris: HO) is a global high-tech leader that invests in digital innovation and \"deep tech\" - connectivity, big data, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and quantum computing - to build a secure future vital to the development of societies.

    "Government announces Poland’s highest ever minimum wage rise": "Poland’s government has announced that the minimum monthly wage will rise by 590 zloty (€125) next year to 3,600 zloty (€763) before tax. That is the highest ever annual increase in absolute terms, while the relative rise of almost 20% is the largest in 15 years.\n\nThe hikes – which will see the minimum wage go up 480 zloty in January and a further 110 zloty in July – comes after annual inflation reached a new 25-year high of 16.1% last month and is forecast to remain high this year and next.\n\nWhile announcing the rise yesterday, Prime Minister Morawiecki declared that his government was “restoring the dignity of work”. Around 3 million of the lowest paid workers are to receive a raise.\n\n“The minimum wage should be a signpost for employers,” added Morawiecki. “The best countries to live in are those where wage inequalities are smaller.”\n\nThe planned wage hikes represent an increase of nearly 16% from January and 19.6% from July, compared to the average annual increase of 7.6% since 2015, when the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party came to power. It is standing for a third term at elections in autumn next year.\n\nNext year’s increase is the highest in relative terms since 2008, when the minimum wage went up by 20.3%. It will also be the first time since 1997 that the minimum wage has been raised more than once a year, something that happens when inflation is above 5%.\n\nThe increase proposed by the government is close to the expectations of trade unions, which have called for a minimum wage of 3,500 zloty in January 2023 and 3,750 in July.\n\nEmployers, however, have expressed disappointment, pointing out that such an increase will be an additional burden on businesses already struggling with rising costs, for example due to rising energy prices, reports news website OKO.press.\n\n🇵🇱 W 2023 roku czeka nas solidna podwyżka płacy minimalnej: do 3490 zł od stycznia i do 3600 zł od lipca. W ujęciu rocznym oznacza to docelowo skok o blisko 1/5. W zależności jak zareaguje na to rynek pracy, czynnik ten stanowi istotne ryzyko dla inflacji na początku roku. — mBank Research (@mbank_research) September 13, 2022\n\nAccording to economists at mBank, an increase in the minimum wage could also pose a risk of further increasing inflationary pressures, “depending on how the market reacts”.\n\nAnalysts at Pekao, another bank, however, suggested that there may still be room for a minimum wage hike in Poland, as “recent years have not confirmed fears that the minimum wage in Poland was rising too fast taking into account falling unemployment rates”.\n\nIn June and July unemployment in Poland was at the lowest level since 1990, when the country was beginning its post-communist transition.\n\nMain photo credit: Liliana Drew / Pexels",
    "Nationalism Is Rising in Poland, and It’s Undermining the Market Reforms That Followed the Fall of Communism": "September takes me to Warsaw in Poland and Hanoi in Vietnam, two countries that have far more in common than most people think. They are two countries that suffered terrible wars—in Poland from 1939 to 1945, and in Vietnam from 1955 to 1975. In each case, millions of people were killed and the country was devastated. And after the wars, each had no chance to recover and rebuild their economies because socialist planned economies were established. In these two countries, the planned economy system led to misery, poverty, and soaring inflation. In both countries, the ruling communists first tried reforms in the existing system until people understood that it was only the introduction of private property rights and a market economy that would help their countries. No countries of comparable size have gained as much in the Index of Economic Freedom as Vietnam and Poland in recent decades, and in both countries the lives of ordinary people have improved dramatically.\n\nDaily Life Under Socialism\n\nWhenever I travel to a country, I first look into its history in order to understand it better. That’s why in Poland I started out by meeting Alicja Wancerz-Gluza, co-founder of the Karta Center, a non-governmental historical archive. Alicja initially became active in the Solidarność trade union movement and later – after the declaration of martial law in Poland – joined the anti-communist underground. On January 4, 1982, together with her husband and a small group of friends, she founded the underground newspaper Karta. Over time, the newspaper, which she wrote on a typewriter and then mimeographed, became a publishing house that published illegal newspapers and books.\n\nToday, the Karta archive has 5,000 books and brochures, about 35,000 newspapers, 300 posters and 1,000 postcards from the underground anti-communist movement. The collection also includes the largest collection of documents from the Solidarność trade union. Alicja proudly shows me a document from UNESCO, confirming that this collection was entered into the international register of world document heritage of UNESCO’s “The Memory of the World” program—together with the wooden boards on which the workers who took part in the strike in August 1980 in the Gdansk shipyard wrote down their 21 demands. Karta collected 6,000 interviews with contemporary witnesses (including 1,000 interviews with former prisoners of the Soviet gulags) and about 400,000 photographs.\n\nDuring our conversation, Alicja explains the realities of everyday life in the socialist planned economy in Poland. She shows me the pile of ration cards Polish people needed to buy food and other products until the collapse of the socialist regime in the late 1980s. The first ration cards were for sugar in 1976. But these cards were still around until the end of the 1980s—for all kinds of products, such as meat, fat, butter, detergent, soap, cigarettes, gasoline, and even shoes. There were also so-called replacement coupons on the cards, which had numbers on them. For example, it was suddenly announced that you could buy school supplies for children or sanitary pads for women using card Number 3.\n\nIn the shop, the saleswoman would use scissors to cut small coupons from the cards. And to get such a card, in turn, you needed other cards, on which every month your employer registered all the cards you had been issued. It was a real tragedy when someone lost one of their cards.\n\nAlicja: “It was a truly special occasion when I got a card from the registry office that would allow me to buy white tights for my wedding. I was also given a certificate stating that because we were getting married we were allowed to buy gold wedding rings in a jewelry store. But we didn’t have the money for that, and we didn’t want rings anyway. So, there were special cards for all occasions, for example, for a funeral you could get a card for black pantyhose.”\n\nBut just because you had the cards didn’t mean you could simply go out and buy the product.\n\nFor the children there were cards for powdered milk and sweets (so-called “chocolate substitutes”). To buy furniture, a washing machine or a television, people had to stand in what were known as “kolejkach społecznych” (social queues). Sometimes, they had to come every day for a month or two and stand in line for hours at a time. Family members waited in line and then swapped places with other family members every few hours. Every couple of hours, names were called out – and if someone wasn’t there, they lost their place in the line and the time they had spent waiting was for nothing.\n\nIt was also difficult to get a telephone. “In my neighborhood, in 1986, there was only one phone booth for all of the streets and buildings in the new district,” Alicja explains. “It was a public phone, no one in my neighborhood had a private phone.”\n\nHer parents moved into their cooperative apartment in 1960 and immediately applied for a telephone line. The phone was eventually connected—13 years later in 1973. And that only happened so “quickly” because her father was a member of the Polish United Workers Party. In any case, international calls could only be made at the post office, where people had to book their calls several hours in advance. And it was only because Alicja’s father was in the party that he also got a special voucher for a car, a Fiat 126p. But he still had to wait until 1980 for his vehicle, despite having received the voucher as a reward for becoming First Party Secretary at his factory.\n\nPeople had to wait for everything, including an apartment. Alicja remembers: “When my future husband was 5 years old, his parents started paying money into a cooperative, so that 25 years later they would have the right to buy a small apartment. My parents started saving a little later because they had previously been saving for my sister.” Twenty-five years later, when she was 29 and her husband 30, they were then able to pool their entitlements, acquired over many years of saving, and move into a small three-room apartment, which was nevertheless far from debt-free and still had to be paid off.\n\nRight and Left Doesn’t Mean Much in Poland\n\nToday, Poland is a country with an exceptionally successful economy. But there are also negative developments. Adam Szlakpka, the leader of the liberal Nowoczesna party, is worried about his country. His party cooperates with a number of other parties, including Donald Tusk’s Civil Platform (PO), the Greens and the Inicjatywa Polska party in the Koalicja Obywatelska (Civic Coalition). The terms “left” and “right” have come to have a very different meaning in Poland compared to other Western European countries: Szalpka believes that 80 percent of the 130 deputies in the Koalicja Obywatelska are free-market, while the ruling Prawo i Sprawiedliwość (Law and Justice) party is very etatist. The PiS party is considered right-wing, but the supporters of the market economy I met in Poland regard that party as socialist because it stands for redistribution, nationalization, and bigger government.\n\nThese explanations were important for me, because in a survey on the opinion of market economy and capitalism I commissioned Ipsos MORI to conduct in Poland and 26 other countries, our findings were somewhat strange. In almost every surveyed country, we found that respondents who classified themselves as left-wing were critical of the market economy and capitalism. In contrast, almost everywhere we conducted our survey, respondents who classified themselves as right-wing were more in favor of the market economy and capitalism. In Poland, however, the situation was partly reversed.\n\nAt the time, I remember calling Dr. Thomas Petersen of the Allensbach Institute, who is also my liaison at Ipsos MORI and certainly the best expert on opinion polls in Germany (for a time, he was even chairman of the World Association for Public Opinion Research). I recall telling him: “Well, I have significant doubts about the data from Poland. Overall, they are plausible, but something must have gone wrong with the right-left allocation, perhaps an error in the coding.” Dr. Petersen asked Ipsos MORI to meticulously check everything—the translation of the questionnaire, the coding, etc.—but there was no doubt: the data were correct.\n\nIf I’m honest, I still didn’t quite believe it. It was only after my conversation with Szlapka that I felt more reassured: “What applies in Western Europe absolutely does not apply here. In our country, the former communists are more free-market than the PiS party, which Germans would classify as right-wing,” he said. The PiS party, he explains, combines nationalism with anti-capitalism and has been particularly successful with voters by claiming that the privatization of state-owned enterprises is a sellout to foreign capitalists.\n\nPiS has radically stopped and even reversed a number of privatizations, some of which were previously carried out by the “left.” For someone from Germany, who considers leftists as anti-capitalists and (moderate) rightists as pro-capitalists, this can be confusing at first. Yes, sometimes you first have to go to the country where a survey was conducted in order to properly understand its results.\n\nThe next day, I met Tomasz Wroblewski from the Warsaw Enterprise Institute, which promotes the market economy and especially small and medium-sized enterprises in Poland. He takes a very critical view of the EU: in the beginning, he says, it played a positive role for Poland, but it is now moving more and more in the direction of state interventionism and restricting economic freedom.\n\nPoland Welcomes Refugees From Belarus With Open Arms\n\nPoland is often criticized by other countries for its refugee policy. However, Poland has not only welcomed a great many war refugees from Ukraine with open arms, it has also accepted refugees from Belarus. Looking at the total number of applications for residence in Poland as well as temporary work permits, Belarusians have been the second largest migrant group in Poland after Ukrainians since 2019.\n\nI met six entrepreneurs from Belarus who fled the country after dictator Lukashenko rigged the August 2020 presidential election, a move that sparked a wave of mass protest. More than 33,000 people were arrested and more than 250 injured in the daily protests. Alexey was a top manager for several companies in Minsk before he joined the protests and led a group of 4,500 opposition members in the Belarusian capital. It was clear that he too would have been jailed if he had not fled. In Poland, he founded an organization that supports the families of political prisoners in Belarus and refugees from the country. With his business savvy and his excellent language skills, he has no doubts that he will also be successful professionally in Poland in the future.\n\nEven before the events of 2020, Serg had repeatedly considered emigrating, but the brutal suppression of the mass protests tipped the scales and he too emigrated to Poland. He cannot understand anyone who still wants to live in the country where Lukashenko rules. Serg was a top manager in Minsk for 20 years and today he has a project in Warsaw to finance start-ups. Before moving to Poland, he lived in Denmark.\n\n“In Copenhagen, I met a lot of happy people with a smile on their lips,” he says. “I also met a lot more happy and friendly people in Poland than in Belarus, although not as many as in Denmark. In Belarus you see many sad and bitter people and very little laughter.”\n\nIncidentally, his subjective impression is in line with the World Happiness Index, which happiness researchers compile on the basis of surveys. Denmark is in second place, Poland in 48th place – and there are no data whatsoever for Belarus.\n\nMikhail is an alarm and security systems specialist. He emigrated from Belarus to Poland in November 2021. He wants to build his successful company here before expanding to other European countries, such as Italy. He is optimistic because Poles, he says, are fond of Belarusians and appreciate their fast work. But many Polish companies are a bit slow, he says, and he hopes to make speed one of his USPs (Unique Selling Propositions)—and the need for security systems is huge everywhere, including Poland.\n\nI used to think that many Poles do not like the Russians for historical reasons. After all, they—like the Germans—have repeatedly invaded and divided the country. Today, however, I learned that Poles make a very clear distinction between Russians and Belarusians. Belarusians, everyone tells me, are held in high esteem in Poland. People in both countries feel connected by history, and unlike with many other neighbors, Poland has never been at war with Belarus. Today’s Belarus was part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Belarusians and Poles fought against Moscow during the January Uprising (1863-1864) and in the Polish-Bolshevik War (1919-21).\n\nBalcerowicz, the Great Reformer\n\nOn the last day of my stay in Poland, I met the legendary Leszek Balcerowicz, the man to whom Poland most owes its economic success. He was twice finance minister and later head of the central bank, first fought inflation and stabilized the country economically, and then introduced the free-market reforms that allowed Poland to become one of the most economically successful countries in the world in recent decades.\n\nProbably the most important insight Balcerowicz had, and the reason for the success of his reform program, was that step-by-step reforms would not help Poland overcome the problems it was facing. Only rapid, comprehensive and radical reforms in all areas could change things for the better. Balcerowicz, unlike many other economists, also possessed a finely tuned political intuition that told him: in this troubled situation, there is only a very short window of opportunity for reforms. He knew that he must either use this window of opportunity with decisive, rapid reform measures, or hesitate, and accept that it would then become more difficult or impossible to implement the reforms.\n\nBalcerowicz is ten years older than me—he’s 75—but just as active. He is the founder and Chairman of the Council of FOR, Civil Development Forum, which promotes a market economy. Balcerowicz is worried about the future of his country. Instead of continuing the reforms he initiated, the PiS party, which has been in power since 2015, is pursuing policies that, he tells me, are more etatist than those of any other government since the end of socialism in Poland. The reforms that were implemented then are now criticized, with nationalists tarnishing privatization as a sellout to the Americans or Germans, and painting a distorted picture of Polish history.\n\nThe blame for the problems Poland experienced in the 1990s was allegedly not the communists, who had run the country into the ground, but the reforms. Yet, Balcerowicz notes, people in the 1990s did understand how important the reforms were and how much their situation improved as a result. Otherwise, he would not have won the 1997 elections with his party in Silesia, Poland’s most industrialized region.\n\nDuring our conversation, I realized what I had already noticed when reading his books: he is not a typical theoretical economist. In fact, at one point he tells me that a theoretical economist is a contradiction in terms, since economists have to deal with reality. This reminded me a little of Marx’s well-known saying that “Philosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways. The point, however, is to change it.”\n\nBalcerowicz changed Poland just as Margaret Thatcher changed Great Britain. For me, he is one of the greatest economic reformers of the twentieth century.

    "Poland to Germany: Pay up!": "Poland's relationship with Germany has taken a further battering thanks to Russia's invasion of Ukraine | Omar Marques/Getty Images\n\nPress play to listen to this article Voiced by Amazon Polly\n\nAt a time when the attention of the European Union is focused on preventing Russia from conquering Ukraine, Poland is reigniting a conflict from the past — with the country’s de facto ruler on Thursday calling for Germany to pay 6.2 trillion złoty (€1.3 trillion) in reparations for its 1939-1945 occupation.\n\n“This is our goal,” Jarosław Kaczyński, the head of Poland’s ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party, said on the 83rd anniversary of Nazi Germany’s invasion of Poland.\n\n“I know that we are embarking on a path that will take a long time and will not be easy. We do not promise quick successes,” Kaczyński said in a press conference to publicize a report prepared by Law and Justice.\n\nPoland was ravaged by Germany’s invasion and occupation, with about 6 million deaths — a fifth of the population (including almost all of its Jewish people). Warsaw was left a smoking ruin. Thursday’s news conference was held in Warsaw’s royal castle, a building destroyed during the war and only rebuilt in the 1970s.\n\n“The Germans invaded Poland and did great damage to us. The occupation was extremely criminal, incredibly cruel and caused effects that in many cases continue to this day,” Kaczyński said.\n\nBut Poland’s post-war communist government — a satellite of the USSR — agreed to drop demands for reparations against East Germany in 1953, making it legally complicated for Warsaw to file any claims. Poland also gained large territories from Germany after the war, while losing about a third of pre-war Poland’s lands to the Soviet Union.\n\n“The position of the Federal Government is unchanged, the reparations issue is closed,” said Germany’s foreign ministry. “Poland renounced further reparations a long time ago, in 1953, and has confirmed this renunciation several times. This is an essential basis for today’s European order. Germany stands politically and morally by its responsibility for the Second World War.”\n\nThe ruins of Warsaw after its occupation by German forces in 1940s | Central Press/Getty Images\n\n“There is no chance for reparations,” Radosław Sikorski, a member of the European Parliament from the opposition Civic Platform party and a former Polish foreign minister, said in a radio interview, warning that the only impact will be to worsen relations between Warsaw and Berlin. “It’s pure propaganda, a fairy tale for the naïve.”\n\nDonald Tusk, the leader of Civic Platform and a former Polish prime minister and president of the European Council, accused Kaczyński of playing politics with his demand.\n\n“This is not about any reparations from Germany, this is about a political campaign,” he said. “Jarosław Kaczyński is not hiding it, that they want to rebuild support for the ruling party with this anti-German campaign.”\n\nPiS hopes to win an unprecedented third term in power in next year’s parliamentary election. Although the party is still leading in opinion polls, it has been losing ground to the opposition as the country deals with high inflation, slowing economic growth and soaring energy prices.\n\nKaczyński has long seen Germany as Poland’s historic enemy, despite both countries being in NATO and in the EU, and Germany being by far Poland’s largest trading partner. He’s suspicious that Berlin is using the EU as a cover to “build the Fourth Reich.”\n\nPoland’s relationship with Germany has taken a further battering thanks to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Warsaw has been one of the most enthusiastic backers of Kyiv, sending money and weapons to Ukraine, while leading the charge to cut off imports of Russian energy and to block Russian tourists from visiting the Continent. Berlin’s caution in moving rapidly in the same direction has aroused Polish anger.\n\nKaczyński’s demand is still not official government policy, and Warsaw hasn’t issued any formal request to Berlin.\n\n“We are obliged today to calculate these losses as accurately as possible and present a proper account to those who owe it,” said Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.\n\nBerlin feels that the 1990 deal allowing West and East Germany to unify ended all outstanding issues related to the war, and rejects demands for reparations.\n\nGermany has paid compensation to individual victims of the Holocaust and to people forced to work as slave laborers, but not to other countries; Greece has an outstanding claim estimated at €289 billion, but the German parliament found it does not have legal merit.\n\nWilhelmine Preussen contributed reporting.\n\nThis article has been updated with comment from the German foreign ministry.",
    "Poland’s largest solar plant goes online": "German developer Goldbeck Solar said it has switched on a 204 MW solar plant in Zwartowo, northern Poland.\n\nThe project is the first phase of a 290 MW scheme that includes another 86 MW facility. The company invested PLN 635 million ($128.8 million) in the 204 MW plant. Construction of the 300-hectare solar park began in the first quarter of 2021.\n\nThe facility is owned by Stigma Sp z o.o., a special purpose vehicle controlled by Green Energy Services sp. zo.o., which is a joint venture between Solarnet Investment GmbH and Goldbeck's Energy Consult Sp. z .o.o. Solarnet Investment GmbH unit. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and Poland's Bank Pekao S.A. and PKO Bank Polski are the main lenders backing the project.\n\nPopular content\n\nThe solar plant features inverters provided by German manufacturer SMA Solar Technology and solar modules supplied by Chinese producer Suntech.\n\n“For Goldbeck Solar, the Zwartowo solar park is important in two respects. Zwartowo is not only the largest plant the solar specialist has built so far, but also a symbol of Joachim Goldbeck’s determination,” the company said in a statement. “Even constant challenges such as the disruption of supply chains and rising component prices could not stop the progress of the project.”"
