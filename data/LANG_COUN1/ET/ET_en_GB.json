    "Detection of circulating vaccine derived polio virus 2 (cVDPV2) in environmental samples– the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America": "\n\n\n\nSituation at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the past few months, there have been several genetically linked Sabin-like type 2 poliovirus (SL2) detections from environmental samples in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (hereafter the United Kingdom) and the United States of America.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, since February 2022, the WHO Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN) located at the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) in London has consistently detected Sabin-like type 2 poliovirus isolates in sewage samples collected from London. Samples collected on 24 and 31 May had sufficient mutations to qualify as vaccine derived polio virus type 2 (VDPV2). Subsequently, due to a new detection of the virus more than two months later, these samples were classified as ‘circulating’ VDPV2 on 8 August. As of 5 September, no human case associated with VDPV2 has been reported in the United Kingdom.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the United States of America, Sabin-like type 2 poliovirus has been consistently detected in environmental samples collected between 21 April to 26 August 2022 from Rockland County, New York State, and nearby counties. In late July, a case of VDPV2 was reported in an unvaccinated individual in Rockland County, who presented with paralysis. The case had no recent history of international travel. This is the first case of poliomyelitis reported in the country since 2013. Due to detection of environmental viral sequences (collected on 3 August and 11 August) containing more than five nucleotide changes, and both linked to the case reported in Rockland County – these viruses are now being classified as ‘circulating’ VDPV2.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe virus detected in environmental samples in New York State, United States of America is genetically linked to viruses detected in sewage samples from London, United Kingdom and in sewage samples collected between January to June 2022 from Jerusalem District, Israel1.\n\nFigure-1 Detection of genetically linked cVDPV2 isolates in the United Kingdom and the United States of America from February to August 2022\n\nEpidemiology of Poliomyelitis\n\nPolio is a highly infectious disease that largely affects children under five years of age, causing permanent paralysis (approximately 1 in 200 infections) or death (5-10% of those paralyzed).\n\nThe virus is transmitted from person-to-person, mainly through the fecal-oral route or, less frequently, by a common vehicle (e.g., contaminated water or food) and multiplies in the intestine, from where it can invade the nervous system and cause paralysis and death. Initial symptoms of polio include fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, stiffness of the neck and pain in the limbs. In a small proportion of cases, the disease causes paralysis, which is often permanent. There is no cure for polio but it can be prevented by immunization.\n\nThe incubation period is usually 7–10 days but can range from 4–35 days. Up to 90% of those infected are either asymptomatic or experience only mild symptoms and the disease often goes unrecognized.\n\nVaccine-derived poliovirus is a well-documented type of poliovirus that has mutated from the strain originally contained in the oral polio vaccine (OPV). The OPV contains a live, weakened form of poliovirus. On rare occasions, when replicating in the gastrointestinal tract, OPV strains genetically change and may spread in communities that are not fully vaccinated against polio, especially in areas where there is poor hygiene, poor sanitation, or overcrowding. Further changes occur as these viruses spread from person to person. The lower the population immunity, the longer this virus survives and the more genetic changes it undergoes. In very rare instances, the vaccine-derived virus can genetically change into a form that can paralyze – this is what is known as a vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV).",

We are particularly concerned about the persistent digital divides that further exacerbate social and economic inequalities around the world.\n\nNow more than ever we need a strong, impactful, and efficient Union providing core expertise in the domains of radio communications, telecommunications/ICTs standards, and bridging the digital divide, including with regard to gender, age and persons with specific needs. The Union should contribute to the digital transformation that puts humans at the centre, empowers individuals and provides meaningful connectivity.\n\nTo this end, we promote a human rights-based approach to the whole life cycle of telecommunication/ICT technologies – including design, development, deployment, use and disposal - as part of a human-centric vision of the digital transformation, including in international standard-setting processes.\n\nIn this light, we should work together to achieve a digital transformation based on openness, inclusion, equality, sustainability, resilience and security. We encourage the ITU, as a member of the UN family and working with other Standard Development Organisations to develop international telecommunications/ICTs standards that are consistent with existing international frameworks on human rights and fundamental freedoms.\n\nWe welcome other UN efforts in this direction, in particular the Human Rights Council Resolution on new and emerging digital technologies and human rights (A/HRC/RES/47/23) that calls for consultations with standard development organizations on human rights and telecommunication/ICT.\n\nIt is equally important that the ITU, which builds upon the expertise of various stakeholders, including industry, SMEs, and academia, redoubles its efforts to make its procedures more transparent and accessible, including to organizations active on human rights aspects of telecommunications/ICTs. Forging consensus and making sure that all stakeholders are heard forms a critical part of the ITU´s work.\n\nThank you for your attention",

    "What the death of Queen Elizabeth II means for the United Kingdom": "The funeral procession for Queen Elizabeth II (Credit: Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport) The funeral procession for Queen Elizabeth II (Credit: Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport)\n\nOne of the main problems with the heavy handed establishment responses to the end of Queen Elizabeth II’s reign are the insistent the declarations of national greatness that so many feel cause to proclaim. Not only does this nationalist cringing conjure an anachronistic nostalgia for greatness at a time when more than one in five Brits live in poverty. Somehow, amidst all the commentary, there is very little reflection on what the death of Queen Elizabeth II might actually mean for the symbolic decline of that greatness, and which will be nowhere more clearly expressed in the end of two geopolitical arrangements: the Commonwealth, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\nFirst, Elizabeth II’s death heralds the end of the Commonwealth – perhaps not immediately, but certainly before the century’s end, and possibly within the next decade. Initially formed in the year of Elizabeth’s birth as the British Commonwealth of Nations, the Commonwealth later dropped ‘British’ from its title and established a criteria of ‘free and equal’ status between its fifty six members in 1949.\n\nElizabeth took the throne just three years later, and the Commonwealth became a point of immense personal passion and pride. Her first public speech in 1940 had been addressed to ‘the children of the Commonwealth’, and she was in Kenya when she inherited the Crown. One of the few times she made her politics publicly known was when Thatcher refused to impose sanctions on apartheid South Africa. Recognising the threat Thatcher’s position posed to the integrity of the Commonwealth, the Queen’s ‘dismay’ was uncharacteristically leaked to several papers, including The Times.\n\nIf the Queen stood as head of a Union on its last legs, her death is one more step towards its eventual demise\n\nHistorically, the Commonwealth has been the institutional vehicle by which Britain managed the formal decolonisation of its Empire. In the past few days, many on the left have understandably pointed to the Queen as a symbol of British colonialism. But as the head of the Commonwealth, she might also be seen as the monarch who oversaw the careful management of the Empire’s gradual dismantling (this is not to say that colonialism does not continue in other forms).\n\nFrom this view, the Commonwealth can be seen as a halfway stage between Britain’s formal Empire and the arrival of full political decolonisation. In the Caribbean, the islands of Antigua and Barbuda, Jamaica, Saint Vincent, and the Grenadines have been on the verge of leaving the Commonwealth for some time, and several other territories host significant republican movements. The death of Queen Elizabeth II will only accelerate this historical flow.\n\nHastening the break up of the United Kingdom\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, it is likely that Elizabeth’s death will not only hasten the break-up of the Commonwealth, but also the fragmentation of the Union itself. Unlike the US, France, Germany, or pretty much any other modern democracy, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland has no written constitution. Instead, when the Kingdoms of England and Scotland joined together in 1707, the constitution was embodied in the person of the monarch.\n\nThis is why you now hear politicians celebrating Elizabeth for standing as a constant above the ‘clashes of politics’ – she was the constitution, both figuratively and literally. With her death, the post-war iteration of that constitution – the only one most living Britons have known – has come apart.\n\nIt is becoming increasingly evident that Charles III will be incapable of reinventing anything like the quiet soft power Elizabeth once held. A second independence referendum in Scotland seems just one general election away; a referendum on Irish reunification is only a little further down the line. If the Queen stood as head of a Union on its last legs, her death is one more step towards its eventual demise.\n\nPerhaps this is the same process of decolonisation running its course – England and Scotland already had colonial possessions in 1707, and Great Britain was always an imperial state, so the break-up of the United Kingdom is arguably the decolonial endgame. But even if that is the case, this process is far more likely to fuel reactionary rather than progressive politics if no efforts are made to find stability through different constitutional means.\n\nAnyone with an understanding of the Queen’s political gravity may therefore feel concerned at the passing of her symbolic heft. For ‘Great Britain’, as an historical territory and imagined community, truly is adrift without it.\n\nA democratic non-monarchical settlement\n\nI say that not as a monarchist or nationalist, whose reach for hyperbolic epithets about British greatness betrays the deepening insecurity of our current settlement. Instead, I invoke it as a republican who recognises how desperately Britain needs a new settlement, one that is capable of tackling multiple, interlinked crises in health, energy, climate, education, social care, regional inequality, and political representation.\n\nWe need a new constitutional agreement for Britain that foregrounds democracy, devolves authority, empowers regions, redistributes wealth, and holds political and financial elites to account. We might call this something like a Green New Deal, but in Britain it must go much deeper than infrastructure plans. Practically, it could start with the removal of unelected leaders, including in the House of Lords, and move towards a vision of the isles as a collection of federalised states with shared constitutional values that are actually written down.\n\nThe specifics will need to be debated, of course. But whatever form they take, it is clear that we need an idea of Britain that has come to terms with the Empire that it was, and which is equally realistic about what it might yet become. Without recognition of this need in constitutional arrangements, we will continue to plunge forward, blind to the many challenges that are quickly becoming far too real to alleviate with the pseudo-warmth of nationalist platitudes.\n\nWe currently lack the imaginative and empathic leaders needed to bring such changes about. Until they emerge, Britain will continue to crumble, shedding parts of itself, and concealing its waning political power beneath the peeling sticking plaster of the culture wars. Meanwhile, more and more of British society will struggle and suffer, rocked by climate and energy crises, disinvested from meaningful imagined communities, and now deprived of even the symbolic salve that Queen Elizabeth II once provided.\n\nDominic Davies is Senior Lecturer in English at City, University of London.

    "King Charles the ‘Green Monarch’ and future of the British monarchy": "King Charles the ‘Green Monarch’ and future of the British monarchy\n\nThe Queen’s death came at a volatile period in British politics, with a recent scandal-induced change of prime minister and skyrocketing energy, food, and gasoline expenses, according to Kevin McGlone, a history professor in the College of Arts and Sciences, in an interview.\n\n“A 2021 poll conducted in England, Scotland, and Wales found that Queen Elizabeth had 70 percent approval, but only 50 percent approved of her son and heir Charles, now King Charles III. It remains to be seen how her death and Charles’ succession to the throne affect public attitudes of the monarchy,” he added.\n\nWith the death and burial of the Queen now over, King Charles is expected to settle in for his real role.\n\nWhat to know about the King and why he is called the ‘green monarch’\n\nCharles Philip Arthur George Windsor, the first son of Queen Elizabeth II and her late husband, Prince Philip, was born on November 14, 1948. As the first modern heir to the British throne, Charles was educated outside of the palace rather than receiving private tutoring, and he later graduated from Cambridge with a Bachelor of Arts.\n\nWhen the queen died on September 8, 2022, Charles, formerly known as Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales, ascended to the throne of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\nKing Charles III is the oldest person to become a British monarch, at the age of 73.\n\nBritain’s next King is a dedicated environmentalist with a long history of pushing for improved conservation, organic farming, and climate change mitigation, which is likely to appeal to more environmentally aware younger Britons.\n\nHow wealthy is he?\n\nAccording to Forbes.com, an American business magazine, Charles now supervises $42 billion in assets and inherited $500 million from Queen Elizabeth, including her castles, jewels, art collection, and a horse farm—all of which are tax-free.\n\nAs Prince of Wales, Charles established a number of initiatives to conserve the environment and promote organic farming. Charles controlled the largest organic food brand in the United Kingdom, as well as a nature retreat and crafts centre in Transylvania, both of which run as bed & breakfasts, through his Charitable Foundation (which William now inherited).\n\nThe sour love story\n\nLady Diana Spencer, later known as Princess Diana, was Charles’ first wife.\n\nThey were married for 15 years, from 1981 through 1996.\n\nDiana was 20 years old and Charles was 32 years old when they married.\n\nTheir wedding was described as a fairy tale, but their marriage was not. The royal couple divorced in 1996 after splitting in 1992.\n\nCharles had always been in love with Camilla, a woman he met almost a decade before in 1970, as the public eventually discovered.\n\nEventually, Charles married Camilla in Windsor in 2005, 8 years after the death of Princess Diana in Paris.\n\nRead also: King Charles officially proclaimed as Britain’s new monarch\n\nHis experience in the corridors of power\n\nPrince Charles is no stranger to political machinations globally.\n\nHe has been to Washington at least 20 times and met every President of the United States since Jimmy Carter.\n\nDuring a three-day visit to the United States in 2015, Charles met with then President Barack Obama for the second time. Obama said in the Oval Office that the American people were “very fond of the royal family,” and that they “like them much better than their own politicians.”\n\n“I don’t believe that,” the king said.\n\nAlso, when former President Donald Trump’s visited the United Kingdom in 2019, Charles was supposed to meet with the American leader for around 15 minutes, but they ended up talking for longer.\n\nAfter their encounter, Trump described him as “a very good person” who was “very into climate change.”\n\n“What touched me was his concern for future generations,” Trump stated. “He wants to ensure that future generations have a decent climate rather than a calamity, and I agree.”\n\nSimilarly, he engaged President Biden at the COP26 climate meeting in Scotland in November 2021 who commended him for his environmental leadership, saying, “We need you badly… and I’m not just saying that.”\n\nThe king’s speech and the water it holds\n\nKing Charles III gave his first speech to the nation as the British monarch on September 9, 2022 following the passing of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nIn his speech, he paid tribute to his mother, saying: “Throughout her life, Her Majesty The Queen -my beloved Mother – was an inspiration and example to me and to all my family, and we owe her the most heartfelt debt any family can owe to their mother; for her love, affection, guidance, understanding and example.”\n\n“Queen Elizabeth’s was a life well lived; a promise with destiny kept and she is mourned most deeply in her passing. That promise of lifelong service I renew to you all today,” King Charles continued.\n\n“The role and the duties of monarchy also remain,” King Charles said, highlighting his responsibility towards the Church of England and his own deep-rooted faith.\n\n“As the queen herself did with such unswerving devotion, I, too, now solemnly pledge myself, throughout the remaining time God grants me, to uphold the constitutional principles at the heart of our nation,” he said.\n\n“And wherever you may live in the United Kingdom, or in the Realms and territories across the world, and whatever may be your background or beliefs, I shall endeavor to serve you with loyalty, respect and love, as I have throughout my life,” he added.\n\nAccording to royal.uk, some of the roles of the monarchy that remains in practice include: to remain strictly neutral with respect to political matters and by convention, to not vote or stand for election; however, they do have important ceremonial and formal roles in relation to the government of the UK.\n\nWhich countries recognise Charles as king?\n\nLike his mother, Charles is the king of the UK as well as 14 other nations, including Canada and others in the Asia-Pacific and Caribbean referred to as the Commonwealth realms.\n\nThey are distinct from the Commonwealth of Nations, a loose association of 54 former British Empire members, the majority of which are now sovereign.\n\nThe Commonwealth realms collectively have about 150 million residents, with the UK, Canada, Australia, Papua New Guinea, and New Zealand having the highest populations.",

The motion mirrored a similar one agreed by the authority in 1952 following the death of King George VI.\n\nToday's motion read: \"The Lord Mayor of Kingston upon Hull and Admiral of the Humber, City Council and Citizens of Kingston upon Hull, desire to express to his His Majesty King Charles the Third their deep sense of the loss which His Majesty and the Members of the Royal Family have sustained in common with the whole of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland by the death of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, whose constant devotion to duty secured for her the regard and affection of all citizens of the United Kingdom, and people across the world, and whose name and memory will ever be cherished by them.\"\n\nREAD MORE: The Queen's funeral - everything you need to know\n\nCouncillors and officials observed a two-minute silence before starting proceedings. Chairing the meeting, Cllr Randall said: \"For many of us she was the only monarch we have ever known. Now the future seems a little uncertain.”\n\nCllr Ross said: “Her visits to Hull brought a sense of excitement to the city when people knew they were going to get a glimpse of the Queen. Our condolences go to King Charles and the Royal family.”\n\n(Image: Hull Live)\n\nHe also thanked all those involved in local recent events commemorating her passing, including Sunday’s Proclamation ceremony held on the City Hall balcony. He encouraged people to gather again in Queen Victoria Square next Monday to watch the Queen’s funeral which is being screened live on a big screen on the same balcony.\n\nCllr Ross said the council was also planning to invite people to submit ideas on a future permanent commemoration to the Queen in the city. More details on this are expected to be announced in the next few weeks.\n\nDeputy council leader Councillor Jackie Dadd was in tears as she delivered her tribute. Councillor Kalvin Neal, who served with the Army in Iraq, said: \"When I fought on the frontline conflict zone I can quite honestly, hand on heart, say I did fight for Queen and country.\n\n\"Yes, the people next to me were important and I was making sure they were OK as well, but I did fight for Queen and country and to understand what that means to me is still quite difficult.\"\n\nOpposition Labour group leader Councillor Daren Hale said: \"It is important to remember there is a family who have lost a loved one. Just because the Queen is a public figure, we must not forget that.\"\n\nFollowing the tributes, the Lord Mayor announced the official Loyal Address to the new King on behalf of the council and the people of Hull.\n\nIt reads: \"We, the Lord Mayor and Admiral of the Humber, City Council and Citizens of KIngston upon Hull are desirous of tendering our heart and sincere congratulations on Your Majesty's accession to the throne of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\n\"We desire to offer Your Majesty the assurance of our loyal attachment and allegiance to Your Majesty's person and throne to express the wish that the reign of Your Majesty will be marked by the furtherance of measures for promoting the welfare, happiness and prosperity of all citizens of this United Kingdom. We wish that Your Majesty may long reign in peace and happiness to the benefit of a loyal and contented people.\"\n\nRead next:",
    "UK's former Labour leader snapped playing Thatcher-slaying Doom mod": "Audio player loading…\n\nJeremy Corbyn, the former leader of the UK's Labour party and two-time candidate for Prime Minister, has been pictured enjoying a game of Thatcher's Techbase in Liverpool ( thanks, Indy100 ). Thatcher's Techbase is a Doom II mod where the late Margaret Thatcher returns to the tenth circle of hell, i.e. the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the player sets out to make sure that this time 'CyberThatcher' stays dead.\n\nDoubtless the current Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer will be delighted to discover that Corbyn's been digitally blasting away at a dead Tory Prime Minister. There isn't even any ambiguity about it, one picture shows him staring at the screen with hands on the controls, and in the second it looks like he's… dabbing?\n\nHe liked the game 🙂 pic.twitter.com/fD9VuNVvYZSeptember 25, 2022 See more\n\nThe Thatcher's Techbase cabinet made its debut at The World Transformed festival, and was built by Thatcher's Techbase creator Jim Purvis to support the tenants' rights organisation Living Rent. Alongside the pictures of Corbyn, Purvis noted that \"he liked the game\" with a smile emoji.\n\nUK politics has been something of a clown show for the last decade and yet even so this is one of the wildest things to happen in some time. Jeremy Corbyn was Labour leader from 2015-2020, during which time the party was in opposition, and was loved by elements of the left for exactly the same reason that the right hated him.\n\nCorbyn's a dyed-in-the-wool socialist leftie, the type of politician who attends picket lines (and radical festivals like this), and he has a knack for saying things that make more centrist voters baulk. A British Bernie Sanders with an allotment. Ultimately the Labour party under his leadership was an electoral failure, and this can be attributed partly to Corbyn's disastrous relationship with the media: he seems a nice enough guy but they monstered him, and he certainly gave them the material to do it with.\n\nJeremy Corbyn now sits as an independent MP, amidst an ongoing disagreement with the parliamentary Labour party, and so there's an element of this which is just him saying 'screw it, why not shoot Thatcher in a game'—it's not like he's worried about the next general election. It should also be said that this is, fundamentally, pretty funny: we're talking about an old socialist playing a Doom II mod starring CyberThatcher.\n\nNevertheless, if you're outside the UK, here's why this could well turn into a shitstorm. Margaret Thatcher is a figure reviled by elements of the UK, for reasons way too numerous to go into here, and conversely idolised by her own side as the Iron Lady of British politics. Jeremy Corbyn is meanwhile something of a boogeyman for right-leaning Brits, and a Captain Planet-esque idol for the socialist left.",

    "Egypt’s Sisi calls King Charles III to offer condolences": "Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi made a phone call on Saturday evening with the United Kingdom’s King Charles III, the current reigning monarch of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\nThe spokesperson of the Egyptian Presidency Bassam Rady said that President Sisi offered his sincere condolences to King Charles III, the government and the people of Britain on the death of Queen Elizabeth II, who he said gave a lot to her people and country over decades.\n\nSisi wished him and the friendly British people all possible success in the future.\n\nKing Charles III thanked President Sisi for this generous gesture, which underscores the peculiarity of the traditional relations between the two friendly countries.\n\nRady added that the call also discussed issues of common interest, especially those related to climate change, in light of the multiple initiatives sponsored by King Charles III, in addition to Egypt’s expected hosting of the COP27 in November in Sharm el-Sheikh.",
    "Britain pessimistic on Scotland's future in Union despite royal moment of unity": "Fewer than one in three Britons believes that Scotland will still be part of the United Kingdom by 2050, The National can reveal.\n\nEven the patriotic fervour of the mourning period for Queen Elizabeth II did not convince Britain that its destiny is to stay together, polling data shows.\n\nA state-of-the-nation survey by Deltapoll for The National also reveals a distinct lack of enthusiasm for Brexit more than two years after the UK left the EU, a move that changed the dynamics of the Scottish independence debate.\n\nA narrow majority of Britons saw Brexit as a bad thing, and 46 per cent said it had gone worse than they expected, compared to only 19 per cent who were pleasantly surprised.\n\nAsked about Scotland, only 31 per cent said it would still be part of the union by mid-century, while 48 per cent said it would not.\n\nOpinion was more closely divided on Northern Ireland, with 46 per cent expecting it to stay in the UK and 32 per cent predicting it will leave, as nationalists gain strength on both sides of the Irish border.\n\nOnly Wales, where nationalists are a smaller presence on the political landscape, is seen as highly likely to stay put, with 61 per cent believing it will and 19 per cent saying it will not.\n\nOther findings in the wide-ranging exclusive poll:\n\n.\n\nThe poll was conducted during the first four days of mourning for the late queen, who typically spent her summers in Scotland and died at Balmoral Castle, a Highland country retreat that belonged to her personally.\n\nIn a procession highly charged with British tradition and symbolism, her coffin was taken from Balmoral to the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh, then lay at rest in St Giles’s Cathedral before her final journey to London.\n\nBut people polled during those days of remembrance for the queen had little confidence that the union would long survive her, despite the brief outbreak of national pride.\n\n“As far as attitudes to independence are concerned, it probably won’t make a huge amount of difference,” Mark Diffley, a researcher and analyst on Scottish public opinion, told The National.\n\n“The proposition for independence does not include Scotland becoming a republic. It includes retention of the monarchy. So you can vote for independence and be a monarchist.”\n\nThe queen came to the throne in 1952 when Britain still had vestiges of the imperial might that once cemented Scotland’s place in the union, but her 70-year reign saw a growing clamour for self-government north of the border.\n\nHer deep attachment to Scotland pushed her about as close as she ever came to expressing a political view, most notably in the last days of the referendum campaign in 2014 that ended with a No vote to independence.\n\nProcession of Queen Elizabeth II's coffin in Edinburgh - in pictures\n\nExpand Autoplay Members of the royal family arrive to attend a vigil at St Giles' Cathedral, in Edinburgh, on Monday for Queen Elizabeth II. AFP\n\nThe queen’s guarded comment that people should “think very carefully about the future” was interpreted as a subtle nod to the No campaign, without making any explicit endorsement that would have compromised her neutrality.\n\nDavid Cameron, the prime minister at the time, later had to apologise after letting slip that the queen had \"purred down the line\" when he briefed her on the result.\n\nA similar coded comment came in 1977, during a time of debate over Scottish devolution, when the queen told parliament: “I cannot forget that I was crowned Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.”\n\nScottish nationalists have sought to make a virtue of the monarchy’s popularity, saying the 419-year-old union of the crowns would continue in an independent Scotland and highlighting the queen’s links to the country.\n\n“Indeed, while she was everyone’s queen, for many in Scotland she was Elizabeth, Queen of Scots,” said Ian Blackford, the leader of the Scottish National Party in the House of Commons, during parliamentary tributes.\n\nBut there have long been doubts, from Scotland to the Caribbean to Australia, over whether the queen’s heirs would be able to match her popularity in countries considering loosening ties with Britain.\n\nKing Charles III visited the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh during the mourning period for the late queen. AFP\n\nMr Diffley said it was too early to assess King Charles III’s popularity in Scotland, but said the monarchy was a little less popular than in the UK at large and that younger people in particular were less enthused.\n\nBut although a good chunk of Yes voters would support a Scottish republic, it is generally a low priority and “there’s not really any votes in this,” he said.\n\n“Even pro-independence supporters and the first minister herself would say that there will be challenges in terms of currency, trade, borders and membership of the EU. The last thing you want to do is to throw in, ‘also, by the way, we’ll get rid of the monarchy’.”\n\nThe SNP wants to call a second Scottish independence referendum in 2023 but the UK government says the question has been settled for a generation, arguing that it alone has the power to sanction such a vote.\n\nWhen The National visited the historic Scottish border town of Coldstream last year, there was much despair at the thought of an international border running along the River Tweed.\n\n\"If we had voted yes in 2014, Scotland would be bankrupt right now,\" said Ian Fraser, 49, from Lanarkshire, a Scottish expat who lives in Dubai.\n\n\"Our annual deficit is too wide and there are never any answers on the main topics, like the five year budget forecast, the currency, how we would get back into the EU and the borders. It's quite scary, truth be told.”\n\nBut the SNP’s argument is that Brexit has effectively invalidated the 2014 referendum because Scotland voted that year, by a 55-45 margin, to remain in an EU-member Britain that no longer exists.\n\n\"Unfortunately, they got dragged out of the EU by the English. I think they have every right to have another referendum based on the new reality,\" said fellow expat Michael Bowles, 51.\n\nScottish nationalists, seen here at a rally in Edinburgh, hope to hold a second referendum in 2023. AFP\n\nNationalists may be bolstered by the finding that Brexit is not proving popular. While 52 per cent of Britons said leaving the EU was a bad thing, more than six years after the referendum, only 39 per cent saw it as a good thing.\n\n\"Obviously not being part of the EU is helping our cause,\" said Wendy Miller, 59, an independence supporter from Aberdeenshire. \"We need to secure our referendum,\" she said.\n\nMs Miller, who lives in Dubai, said she was a big supporter of the idea of an independent Scotland. “We need to secure our referendum,” she said. “Obviously not being part of the EU is helping our cause.”\n\nThe poll confirmed a strong generational divide on Brexit. While 70 per cent of millennials had a negative view of Brexit, 55 per cent of those in the baby boomer generation saw it as a good thing.\n\nIn addition, there was a lukewarm response to the bilateral trade deals touted by Brexit supporters as one of the main advantages of Britain’s economic autonomy.\n\nOnly 34 per cent said post-Brexit trade deals had been a good thing, while 43 per cent thought they were a bad thing.\n\n“Intuitively, those who see that Brexit has overall been a good thing for the UK also harbour positive views to whether Brexit has gone better than expected and the trade deals the UK government has signed post-Brexit,” Deltapoll’s polling report said.\n\n“They are also more supportive of focusing on building relationships with countries outside the EU and either maintaining or having a weaker relationship with the EU.”\n\nDeltapoll interviewed 2,096 adults in Britain between September 9 and 12.",
    "Nothing for us, without us: new film series on people living with noncommunicable diseases and mental health conditions": "Helena, a paediatrician and mother, living in Sheffield in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, was already living with multiple disabilities caused by an auto-inflammatory disease when she was diagnosed with cancer in 2009.\n\n“I went from being a very active, very dynamic paediatrician, mother, and athlete […] to being in a wheelchair. I was extremely independent, and – as a woman – felt very strongly about being a role model for my boys. I think that is what you have to learn to hang onto, that on the inside, you haven't changed.”, she recounts.\n\nHelena is one of six people in a short film documentary that sheds light on the experiences of people living with noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and mental health conditions around the world. People with lived experience often can offer valuable expertise and powerful narratives on how to manage and improve their individual health as well as the health of fellow community members. Their first-hand insights can help shape policies, create better health programmes, and inspire others to contribute.\n\nWHO is dedicated to advancing the meaningful engagement of people living with NCDs and mental health conditions worldwide, and has recently established a range of activities and platforms to support this goal. The latest is a new film series on the topic in all six UN languages.\n\nWatch the entire 30-minute documentary, “Nothing for Us, Without Us: listening and learning from people with lived experience”, on WHO’s YouTube channel:\n\nType 2 diabetes in a changing environment: Ali’s lived experience in Lebanon\n\nIn the municipality of Ghobeiry in Lebanon, Ali motivates others in his community to exercise, eat better food and lead a healthier life, after being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 2017.\n\n“People may not be taking care of themselves, not because they can't buy medicine, or are without access to healthy food. They would have all the tools, but they are unable to use them for underlying mental reasons.” he says.\n\nIndividuals and communities with first-hand experience in living with NCDs and mental health conditions hold the key to designing effective, inclusive, equitable health interventions that leave no one behind. Their voices can unlock opportunities to overcome barriers in accessing and sustaining health care. The right to participate in one’s care is also a fundamental part of the human right to the highest attainable standard of health.\n\nWatch Ali’s story:\n\nGender Based Violence and Mental Health: Hauwa’s lived experience in Nigeria\n\nHauwa, a mental health and human rights advocate from Nigeria, was sexually assaulted in 2013 and diagnosed with bipolar disorder two years later.\n\n“We know what is best for us. That is why our needs, our choices, voices, and experiences have to be prioritized. We need to tell you what support looks like for us. We need to tell you what a system that is just and equal and fair looks like for us. We need to tell you what human rights respecting treatment looks like for us.”, as she calls upon policy-makers and health professionals.\n\nAmid the complex and interconnected global health landscape, the meaningful engagement of people with lived experiences is increasingly becoming a mainstay. In light of the global epidemic of NCDs, the recent COVID-19 pandemic, and persisting health inequities, understanding the complex determinants of health conditions and upholding principles of respect, value and dignity are equally crucial.\n\nWatch Hauwa’s story:\n\nType 1 Diabetes and the next generation of leaders: Mark’s lived experience in Brazil\n\n“When I received the diagnosis, it was […] difficult to deal with a situation that was now mine. Even though I saw other people with diabetes […], they were much older, and I didn't know anyone my age who had diabetes. That's why it's not easy to face it., recalls Dr Mark Barone, the Brazil-based vice-president of the International Diabetes Federation.\n\nMeaningful engagement of people with lived experiences also pays particular attention to the voices of marginalized or neglected groups and communities. Community networks play a vital role in providing people with access to critical information and support and breaking down siloes and barriers.\n\nWatch Mark’s story:\n\nCommunity action on breast cancer: LaVerne’s lived experience in Australia\n\n\n\nLaVerne, a breast cancer survivor, mother, and community leader from Redfern, Australia, regularly organizes screenings and health promotion activities with Aboriginal women.\n\n“We have screening days where we bring the mammogram bus. We have lunch, we get hairdressers in, beauty practitioners. It's a real ladies’ day. It enables them to feel free and talk among themselves. Aboriginal women, you know, young women, they don't want to go and take all their clothes off and get tested.”, she points out.\n\nCrucially, meaningful engagement and co-designing health policies imply a shift from the individual as a passive user to an empowered and valued agent of change. People with lived experience do not only require a seat at the table of decision-making, but should be able to drive processes, co-create programmes, and implement contextual solutions.\n\nWatch LaVerne’s story:",

    "The UK will meet or exceed the amount of military aid spent on Ukraine in 2022 next year": "British assistance next year is expected to include the transfer of additional multiple launch rocket systems.\n\nThe Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Liz Truss, notes that British military assistance to Ukraine in 2023 could exceed the current figures in the amount of 2.3 billion pounds.\n\nThis is stated in a statement on the website of the British government.\n\nPrime Minister Liz Truss will use her visit to New York this week to solidify the UK’s commitment to Ukraine’s security and territorial integrity, with the announcement that the UK will match or exceed our record 2022 military support to Ukraine next year.\n\nIn the last two weeks the world has witnessed a significant moment in the war in Ukraine, with territory in the east of the country liberated by the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The Prime Minister will point to this success as evidence of what the Ukrainian people can do with the backing of fellow democracies.\n\nThe Prime Minister will use her speech to the UN General Assembly on Thursday to underscore the UK’s long-term commitment to Ukraine, with no let up in our military, humanitarian and political support to the country.\n\nThe UK is already the second largest military donor to Ukraine, committing £2.3bn in 2022. We have trained 27,000 members of the Ukrainian Armed Forces since 2015, and in the last year we have provided hundreds of rockets, five air defence systems, 120 armoured vehicles and over 200,000 pieces of non-lethal military equipment.\n\nLast week saw the largest commercial road move of ammunition since the Second World War as tens of thousands more rounds of UK-donated artillery ammunition went to the front lines in Ukraine.\n\nThe precise nature of UK military support in 2023 will be determined based on the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. However, it is expected to include equipment like the Multiple Launch Rocket System, provided to Ukraine by the UK and others, which has been decisive in allowing Ukraine to re-gain over 3,000 square kilometres of territory in recent days.\n\nThe Prime Minister said:\n\nUkraine’s victories in recent weeks have been inspirational. Time and time again these brave people have defied the doubters and showed what they can do when given the military, economic and political support they need.\n\nMy message to the people of Ukraine is this: the UK will continue to be right behind you every step of the way. Your security is our security.\n\nAs Putin struggles to maintain his hold in eastern Ukraine, he is using Russia’s grip on European energy supplies to economically blackmail the people of Europe. Earlier this month Russia again closed off the Nord Stream Pipeline. Driven by Russian threats and restrictions on supply, the world has seen a spike in energy and food prices in recent months.\n\nThe Prime Minister will use her meetings with fellow leaders and CEOs in New York to catalyse global efforts to stop Russia from profiting off its energy exports while ending energy dependence on authoritarian regimes.\n\nThe Prime Minister said:\n\nBy turning off the taps of Nord Stream gas pipeline, Putin has consigned millions of people in Europe to a colder and more difficult winter. Too many lives – in Ukraine, in Europe and around the world – are being manipulated by a dependence on Russian energy. We need to work together to end this once and for all.\n\nIn her first week in office, the Prime Minister took comprehensive action to help the people of the UK struggling with the cost of living as a result of global headwinds caused by Russia’s war in Ukraine and the aftermath of Covid.\n\nThis included the creation of a new Energy Supply Taskforce which is working with international gas suppliers to increase the global supply and reduce the price of gas.\n\nThe UK is also speeding up our deployment of clean and renewable technologies including hydrogen, solar, carbon capture and storage, and wind – where the UK is already a world-leader in offshore generation.",

    "King Charles and the Jacobin Right": "Charles Windsor has gone through an extraordinarily rapid transformation. We all know that he became King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and its overseas territories and other Commonwealth realms, the second the Queen’s heart stopped beating on the afternoon of Thursday, 8 September 2022. In the minds of the UK’s Jacobin Right, he went through an even more dramatic metamorphosis at the same time: from the lunatic lefty “Clown Prince” who was in league with Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab, George Soros and the other members of the shadowy elite syndicate that apparently run the world through the obscure auspices of the World Economic Forum — to His Majesty the King, the venerable Sovereign and beloved Liege Lord of the great country on God’s green earth.\n\nIt is one enormous throbbing id dressed up as a political ideology\n\nIt’s easy to mock the motley cast of characters that make up the crankish world of the Guido-GB News British right — and it’s very entertaining, too, so let’s do that for a paragraph. Many of them appear to be confused adolescent boys who accidentally wandered into a TV studio in the middle of a school trip and have mysteriously never been asked to leave since. Like a horrible right-wing mirror image of the deranged children that inhabit that barely-glorified hard-left intellectual creche “Novara Media”, they have been conducting an adolescent William Hague impersonation contest ever since — although to be fair to North Yorkshire’s favourite pint-downing former Tory leader, they have succeeded in making him look like a cross between Benjamin Disraeli and Edmund Burke.\n\nIt’s not just the kids though: there are plenty of hoary old-timers who have done a dramatic u-turn now that deranged eco-terrorist Prince Charles has become the Almighty’s glorious anointed. Nigel Farage interrupted a busy schedule of day-drinking, wistful self-googling and bashing away on the Daily Mail comment section to give his ever-so-slightly obsequious verdict on the King’s early performance. One can only surmise that a portrait of His Majesty has already replaced his beloved, and perhaps slightly soiled, framed photo of the Queen that he kept on his wall between the Pirelli calendars and his mint-condition collection of Rothmans cigarette cards.\n\nIn their various ways, what these characters sum up is the extent to which there is a section of the modern British right that is simply one enormous great throbbing id dressed up as a political ideology. Many of the younger ones take libertarian licence to an extreme of glorious self-parody. Should children be allowed to take crack cocaine? Or perhaps sell their kidneys at auction to a gang of international organ-harvesters in lieu of a school fundraising tombola? “Who are YOU to stop them, Nanny State Nazis?”, opine Darren Harwood and baby Guido.\n\nEnvironmental politics is a good example. It’s a complex area, and there are good reasons to be sceptical about many specific aspects of the green agenda of the government and activist groups. But it’s hard to shake off the impression that what lies behind the hysterical attacks on the then-Prince Charles’ work to highlight the risks of plummeting biodiversity, climate change, soil erosion and various other forms of environmental degradation is the same sort of emotion that lies behind the toddler who is told that they cannot have their fourth mini-milk: sheer disbelieving outrage than anybody should ever question their right to have whatever they want, whenever they want it and damn the consequences.\n\nIt’s a part of the Right Jacobin mentality that has become a distinctive phenomenon among many contemporary so-called conservatives. They share the abstract rationalising tendency of the French revolutionaries — and indeed most of the modern hard left — to see politics as a mere utilitarian machine designed to smash anything that gets in the way of the fulfilment of their immediate will and pleasure. The slow accretion of tradition as the collected wisdom of the species; the caution embodied in the idea of Chesterton’s fence; the grandeur of our long-standing national institutions: all such ideas are, in substance, so much lily-livered “bed-wetting” flim-flam so far as the San-Culottes of the Home Counties are concerned. They’d have the King in a tumbril tomorrow if they thought it would lead to zero per cent corporation tax and a lot of Albanians drowning in the English channel.\n\nSome faint glimmerings have been summoned up in their souls\n\nIronically, they reproduce in reverse so many of the assumptions of the hard left. In many cases — Tom Grimes being a good example — they are just Whiggish liberals who take the inevitable progressive course of history as a given, but disagree with the Corbynistas and nose-ringed Tankies as to what form it should take. They simply see the dynamism of the unleashed free market as a better way to the world of materialistic abundance and self-indulgence they crave than “Fully Automated Luxury Communism” or cyber-Stalinism or whatever tedious, nightmarish utopia the hard left are currently peddling. The difference is one of means, not ends: they are all equally lacking in any aesthetic or spiritual sensibility. This is really why they hated the postliberal politics of Charles, a man who values restraint, limits, boundaries, discipline; and understands that we cannot limitlessly abuse the Earth simply because we want endless wasteful profusion. It’s why they cannot truly appreciate the prescriptive wisdom of our customs and traditions.\n\nThe problem is, of course, that such Right Jacobins don’t exist in a vacuum. They are an understandable — if wrong-headed and unfortunate — overreaction to the condescension of a liberal-left technocratic mindset that is no better. When genuine debate, reasonable compromises and pragmatic accommodations are made impossible by the breakdown of meaningful democratic politics at the hands of both quasi-totalitarian progressivism and ultra-liberal hubris, one can hardly be surprised that morbid symptoms appear on the right. However intransigent the progressive Brahmins may be and however mad the social justice warriors are, it’s a mistake to respond with a sort of golf club Leninism.\n\nIn a spirit of generosity, let’s be encouraged by the fact that some faint glimmerings of the glories of tradition, duty and sacrifice have been summoned up in their souls by the death of our late Queen and the accession of Charles. It’s never too late to abandon one’s youthful revolutionary errors and embrace the politics of virtue, restraint and the transcendent. God hasn’t abandoned anyone to such errors irrevocably — even Nigel Farage."
