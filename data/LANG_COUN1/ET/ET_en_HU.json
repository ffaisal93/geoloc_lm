    "Hungary Should Guarantee Safety of Lesbian Activists During DykeMarch": "Click to expand Image Rising anger over policies of Hungary's right-wing government filled the streets of the country's capital as thousands of LGBT activists and supporters marched in the city's Pride parade in Budapest, Hungary, July 2021. © 2021 Anna Szilagyi/AP Images\n\nHungarian lesbian activists are set to hold their second DykeMarch on October 1, the final day of the EuroCentralAsian Lesbian* Community (EL*C) Conference in Budapest. This year’s conference, “Lesbian Resistance,” will open two weeks after Serbia initially banned EuroPride 2022, the latest in a two-year spate of attacks on Pride marches and other queer events in Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Serbia, Turkey, and Ukraine.\n\nThe EL*C conference and DykeMarch come amid ongoing government harassment of lesbian activism in Hungary. In February, an appeals court ruled against Labrisz Lesbian Association, finding that an article in a pro-government newspaper likening lesbian activists to pedophiles did not injure their reputation. This reversed a lower court decision, which deemed the article to be unfounded and offensive.\n\nIn June 2021, a Hungarian law criminalized showing “any content portraying or promoting sex reassignment or homosexuality” to children, falsely conflating LGBT rights with pedophilia. In August 2021, a government decree restricted customer access to the children’s book “A Fairytale for Everyone”, published by Labrisz Lesbian Association in 2020, under a new requirement that children's books seen to “promote homosexuality” be sold only in “closed wrapping.” The Labrisz book retells traditional fairytales with queer, feminist characters.\n\n“Having the conference in Budapest means a lot to us,” said Dorottya Redai, an activist with Labrisz. “Labrisz has been fighting against the political oppression of sexual minority women since 1999. Under the current government, we work harder than ever. We hope the Conference will signal to the government that lesbian resistance is powerful and won’t be silenced.”\n\nThe EL*C conference and DykeMarch take an intersectional approach, demanding rights for migrants, refugees, Roma communities, and other minority groups. As such, organizers could be at risk vis-a-vis Hungary’s sweeping criminalization in 2018 of migrant and refugee rights defenders. That law, condemned by several United Nations Special Rapporteurs and held by the Court of Justice of the European Union to violate EU law, remains in effect.\n\nGiven these wide-ranging attacks on queer, feminist, migrant, and minority rights advocacy, Hungarian authorities should ensure that the rights to freedom of assembly, association, and expression are protected during the EL*C conference and DykeMarch, and repeal laws that criminalize the work of activists and human rights defenders.",

    "European Parliament Ups Pressure for Action on Hungary": "Click to expand Image People protest in Heroes’ square against a new law that would undermine Central European University, a liberal graduate school of social sciences founded by U.S. financier George Soros in Budapest, Hungary, April 12, 2017. © 2017 Reuters\n\n“Hungary is no longer a democracy.” That’s the key phrase in the European Parliament’s decision today to call for greater action on Hungary’s democratic backslide.\n\nExactly four years after the European Parliament triggered the EU treaty’s Article 7 procedure on Hungary, which allows the bloc to handle governments at odds with the EU’s founding values, today’s report should be a wake-up call that other EU institutions have largely failed to act.\n\nIn those four years, Hungary’s authorities have abused judicial appointment rules in order to nominate supporters, used the Covid-19 pandemic and now the war in Ukraine to justify executive power-grabs, and criminalized the country’s civil society, subjecting organizations to intrusive scrutiny and public smears. Pressure on independent media, risks of state surveillance, and increasing concentration also threaten media pluralism and independence. And this week, the government severely restricted access to abortion, issuing a decree forcing people to hear the heartbeat of the fetus before obtaining an abortion.\n\nThe government has also crushed academic freedom. Last year, an ominous law restricted access to publications or broadcasts on lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender issues: a major blow to nondiscrimination and free speech. And Viktor Orbán’s increasingly racist rhetoric about “mixed races” recently triggered an international uproar.\n\nOrbán has crossed many lines, but has faced little or no real consequences. Despite bringing Hungary before the EU Court on important cases, the EU Commission has done little to ensure Budapest complies with court rulings. It has dragged its feet on the use of rule-of-law conditionality for access to EU money. EU member states have regularly debated the situation in Hungary but have failed to advance Article 7 proceedings.\n\nThe European Parliament’s report rightly slams the Council and the Commission for their inaction. EU Commission chief Ursula Von Der Leyen should back the Parliament’s calls to progress the Article 7 procedure, and the Commission should suspend some EU funding when media and civil society cannot operate. Budapest’s flimsy proposals for an anti-corruption authority should not end EU scrutiny on the situation.\n\nEU member states should take their responsibility under Article 7 seriously and adopt time-bound rule-of-law recommendations and vote to determine EU values are at serious risk in Hungary.\n\nIf the EU wants to be credible in defending democracy in Ukraine and elsewhere, it should show its own members are held to the highest standards.",

    "The E.U. Is Finally Standing Up to Viktor Orbán": "For more than a decade, Hungary’s prime minister Viktor Orbán has been locked in battle with the European Union over the democratic rules that Brussels expects E.U. member states to uphold. His commitment to “illiberal” Christian democracy has long since become a flashpoint. An E.U. report released earlier this month accuses Orbán of transforming Hungary into an “electoral autocracy” in which the prime minister has made “deliberate and systematic efforts” to undermine E.U. values.\n\nOrbán, a talented populist who has built his public popularity by picking fights with Eurocrats, insists he is merely defending Hungarian traditional values. But he stands accused in the report of attacks on press freedom, the independence of judges and courts, academic freedom, minority rights, and the rights of asylum seekers. None of this is new, but the report dropped at a highly charged moment.\n\nOn September 15, the European Parliament voted by an overwhelmingly majority to approve that report, which not only criticized Hungary for undermining democracy and the rule of law but also the European Commission for failing to force Hungary to change course. Orbán dismissed the report and the vote as a “bad joke.”\n\nFor years, the E.U. has had few good options to force Orbán and his Fidesz party to respect the rules, because so many of its potential punishment measures against offending member-state governments require unanimous support from other EU members, allowing Orbán to rely on support from fellow populists in Poland who can use vetoes to provide him with cover. But Brussels can hold back badly needed cash from the EU budget if it can prove there is credible risk the funds will be stolen by corrupt officials within the country in question.\n\nOn September 18, the E.U. fired this shot for the first time in its history.\n\nThe European Commission formally recommended that EUR 7.5 billion in funding for Hungary be held back until its government addresses a long list of specific issues. This isn’t the only money at risk. Unsuccessful E.U. bargaining with Hungary over terms of disbursement of EUR 14.9 billion in grants and loans as part of a COVID Recovery Fund leave Budapest short of money equaling about 8.5% of the country’s GDP. That’s a big hit for a small country.\n\nOther member states will vote in November on whether to withhold these funds, and the outcome won’t require unanimity but simply a “qualified majority,” a much lower threshold that leaves Orbán without protection. If the vote is yes, as is widely expected, Budapest will have one month to respond with changes meant to meet E.U. demands.\n\nOrbán is holding a weak hand. His government is already contending with high prices, a wobbly currency, and an energy crisis. Headline inflation rose to 15.6% in August, its highest point in 24 years. Prices for staple foods like milk, bread, and poultry have surged between 40% and 65% over the past year. After an election-year spending spree to support Orbán’s most recent victory, Hungary’s budget deficit is already far worse than his government forecast. Despite that, the government has buckled to public pressure by taking on an even heavier burden. In particular, it will extend price caps on some foods and fuels until the end of the year.\n\nRead More: The E.U. Is United Against Russia, With One Exception\n\nAdding to the pressure on Hungary’s economy, fears raised by E.U. action have weighed heavily on the forint, Hungary’s currency. It’s down 16% against the EUR over the past 12 months and 37% against the US dollar. Hungary’s current account deficit more than doubled from July to August of this year.\n\nIn short, the writing on the wall is so clear that even Viktor Orbán can read it. He and his party are still plenty popular at home. He can get by a while longer by blaming the E.U. and the war in Ukraine for Hungary’s economic problems.\n\nBut a rough winter looms, as Hungary, one of the countries most deeply dependent on energy supplies from Russia, scrambles for help. Failure to get prices under control could well start to cut into his support. Hungary needs that money, and it will have to jump through dozens of hoops to get it. Orbán’s government has already moved to begin meeting E.U. demands. On September 19, it sent parliament an anti-corruption bill. More such moves are in the works or will be soon.\n\nMore broadly, this is the opening salvo in a bid by E.U. officials to become much tougher with the governments of member states that flout Union rules on core values like rule of law. Brussels doesn’t want this fight to escalate, but it knows that other members are watching to see if these newly tough measures have teeth. Orbán will try to do as little as possible to unlock the funds his government needs. The E.U. doesn’t want a crisis that inflicts pain on Hungary’s people, but its leaders know they need to send a message that will be received across Europe.\n\nThe two sides will probably reach a deal, though it will surely take time. There will be many devils in many details that must be managed. The E.U. escalation is just the opening salvo of a much longer bureaucratic battle ahead.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com.",
    "Hungary Wants to Host Italian Super Cup": "Italian newspaper La Repubblica reported over the weekend that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has offered 8 million euros to the Italian Football Federation if Hungary hosts the next Italian Super Cup (Supercoppa Italiana), according to Index, a Hungarian news site, which contacted the Prime Minister’s Office in this regard.\n\nAccording to the Italian newspaper, a few weeks ago, the Hungarian Prime Minister proposed the idea of Budapest hosting the Italian Super Cup, and the Italian Football Federation is reportedly considering the offer.\n\nThe out-of-town venue would not be new, with Saudi Arabia hosting the 2018 and 2019 Super Cups, and the country is also planning to host the upcoming match on January 18, 2023. However, according to La Repubblica, this could easily change and the federation could decide to host the match in Hungary instead.\n\nRelated article 0:1 - Hungarian Team Beats Dull Germany in Leipzig Ádám Szalai's goal keeps Hungary in top position in the group of deathContinue reading\n\nEven though the original article mentioned Budapest as a possible venue, several media outlets reported that the Hungarian Prime Minister offered to host the match at the Pancho Aréna in Felcsút, close to his home. However, this might be an error, since the Pancho Aréna can only accommodate 3,500 people. The Hungarian offer probably stands for the Puskas Aréna in Budapest which can host more than 67,000 fans.\n\nBudapest would be a good alternative, if only because Hungary is significantly closer to Italy than Saudi Arabia.\n\nSo the fact that teams and fans would have to travel less to the Hungarian capital is not a negligible factor. The Italian Super Cup will be played between Inter Milan and AC Milan, and according to media reports, both teams would prefer Hungary as the venue.\n\nLa Repubblica reports that the decision about the football match could be heavily influenced by the result of the Italian elections on Sunday.\n\nThe Italian coalition of right-wing parties won the election by a large margin, as a result of which Giorgia Meloni, the leader of the Brothers of Italy (FdI) party and an ally of Viktor Orban, is likely to become the next Italian prime minister.\n\nMeanwhile, Hungary and Italy will play against each other today in Puskás Aréna in the Nations League. The teams are in competition for first place within their group, which is now led by Hungary after defeating Germany on Friday.\n\nFeatured photo via MTI/Illyés Tibor",

    "Hungary Will Continue Issuing Visas to Russians, Foreign Minister Says": "Peter Szijjarto, the Hungarian Foreign Minister, has confirmed that his government will continue issuing Schengen visas to Russian nationals, despite the ongoing sanctions imposed on the latter and talks for an eight package of restrictions being on the way.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n“It’s a somewhat more complex and slow procedure compared to when there is such a treaty. But even when there’s no agreement, it doesn’t mean we don’t issue visas. Of course, we will continue doing so, in accordance with the procedure,” Szijjarto said in New York, attending the UN General Assembly.\n\nThe EU agreed on July 31 to discontinue the agreement with Russia, which simplified visa issuance to Russian citizens, SchengenVisaInfo.com reports.\n\nPoland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania later introduced restrictive measures to Russian tourists, including visa issuance, later also joined by Finland. On the other hand, Germany and France opposed a blanket ban on Russian tourists entering the zone.\n\nSpeaking regarding these measures, the Minister said that those sanctions imposed on Russia haven’t proved to be any successful, and they are, in fact, harming Europe, citing the sanctions as the reason why inflation has increased, utility bills, gas and food prices are soaring, putting the continent’s economy into recession.\n\nSzijjarto said for Kossuth Rádió, a Russian media, that an agreement reached with EU leaders in the most recent meeting for an eighth package had failed as no proposal was made, let alone a final decision.\n\n“We will not approve any decision that harms Hungary’s national interests. The security of our energy supply remains a red line. Any sanction that puts our energy supply at risk is unacceptable for us,” he said.\n\nHe also noted his disappointment for his “Western colleagues” that don’t want to negotiate, while Szijjarto values dialogue and negotiations. According to him, if the EU closes diplomatic channels, there could be no end to the war in Ukraine.\n\nRussia’s Gazprom is delivering 5.8 million cubic metres of gas to Hungary on a daily basis, in addition to volumes regulated in the country’s long-term contract. Hungary’s reserves now contain enough gas to cover 41 per cent of annual consumption, considerably more than the 23 per cent that Europe currently covers as a whole, as Szijjarto said.\n\nThese declarations follow the proposal of the European Commissioner for Budget, Johannes Hahn, to cut funding to Hungary, as the country is failing to align its politics with those from the EU. More specifically, €7.5 billion designated to Hungary will be cut off, as the country is also lacking in respecting democracy, in addition to refusing to impose sanctions on Russia.",

    "Good news: Indian summer will arrive in Hungary soon!": "It might happen that, in some weeks, you will feel better outside than inside in Hungary. That is because Hungarian public institutions will only be heated to 18 °C, while on the streets there will be 25 °C and sunshine. Indian summer will arrive in Hungary soon. Below you may read the details.\n\nThe end of this September is much colder than average, and there are a lot of rains everywhere in Hungary. That is good news because of the drought that hit Hungary hard during the summer but depletes our bank account. The heating season started in many places in Hungary because of the extra low temperatures, so people have to pay their increased energy bills earlier than people previously thought. Indian summer may ease that burden for a while soon, rtl.hu reported.\n\nIn Hungary, summer is hot and dry while autumn is windy and rainy but not extreme cold. However, hot weather can return even in October. The characteristic of such days is that, despite morning fogs and rains, late morning and afternoons are nice and warm, perfect for a jogging program or a trip. Therefore, it is not unusual to see people going to work, and school in jackets and returning home wearing only a T-shirt.\n\nRead alsoHungarian international airport to close in October\n\nThat is because on windless days, the sun waves reaching our body can raise even 10 °C on our general feeling of heat.\n\nThis year the Indian summer will not be long, rtl.hu says.

    "Officers in police and fire stations will freeze in Hungary": "A recent regulation limited the maximum temperature in state institutions. This also affects the police and fire stations, so the barracks cannot be heated to proper temperatures. Not only that but private heating appliances cannot be used either. The only option for officers and firefighters is to dress as warmly as possible.\n\nAccording to the National Catastrophe Prevention Directorate (Országos Katasztrófavédelmi Főigazgatóság), as the state finances all stations, all regulations apply to them as well, reports RTL.hu. The regulation limits the maximum temperature inside all state-financed institutions and facilities to eighteen degrees. Zsaruellátó.hu posted a letter on their Facebook page, which says that until 15 October, the heating cannot be turned on and no heating appliances can be used. However, the Hungarian National Bank is exempted from this regulation.\n\nThe exemptions include social boarding houses, health- and childcare facilities, also in indoor public swimming pools. In elementary schools, the temperature can even reach twenty degrees.\n\nPunishment for service\n\nIn the letter, it is also stated that heating can only be turned on if the regional police station permits it.

The advice for police officers was that the protection against cold should be assured by proper clothing and regular exercise. Another post details the negative effects of this regulation and the potential health risks.\n\nIt is also a problem that electricity usage will be limited, therefore officers cannot charge their phones or equipment. Officers are angered by these actions, stating that it limits their abilities to efficiently do their jobs.

    "Hungary’s ‘pro-Russia’ stance was inevitable": "Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán traveled to Moscow for the funeral of Mikhail Gorbachev. His attendance leaves Europe questioning if Hungary is pro-Russia | Evgenia Novozhenina/AFP via Getty Images\n\nWilliam Nattrass is a freelance journalist and commentator based in Prague.\n\n“Hungary condemns Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.” The words sound unequivocal, but in the context of Hungary’s actions, do they ring true?\n\nAs European allies send weapons to Ukraine and try to minimize their dependence on Russian energy, Hungary has been taking a starkly different path. So far, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has refused to send military aid to Kyiv, and he recently concluded a new gas deal with the Kremlin to help Hungary weather the winter. He’s also more open to continuing normal diplomatic relations with Russia, traveling to Moscow for the funeral of Mikhail Gorbachev, who he said helped Central Europe “rid itself of Communism peacefully, without loss of life or blood.”\n\nWithin Europe, the country stands out like a sore thumb. And with broad support for Orbán’s non-interventionist policy, the question of involvement in the war isn’t even a major wedge issue domestically. So, is it reasonable to claim that Hungary is “pro-Russia”?\n\nThe short answer is no. Hungary’s ambivalent stance is the inevitable result of a combination of domestic political influences, as well as its complex relationships with Russia, Ukraine and the West. In many ways, it is the story of the country’s recent history.\n\nThe main problem with the simple pro-Russia label is that Hungarian attitudes toward Russia and Russians are far from friendly. Perceptions of Russia are still colored by Soviet forces crushing the Hungarian uprising of 1956, just as the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia haunts Czechs and Slovaks to this day. Even Orbán himself was a fervent anti-communist campaigner in the twilight years of the Eastern Bloc.\n\nPro-Russia social currents are also arguably much weaker in Hungary than among its Slavic neighbors. Nationalist movements in Slovakia, Serbia and the Czech Republic often share a sense of ideological kinship with Russia, one linked to suspicion of the West, seeing Ukraine’s pro-Western policy as something akin to a betrayal of Slavic identity.\n\nHowever, such interpretations of the war don’t exert the same sway in Hungary because Hungarians aren’t Slavic — neither do they nurture positive attitudes to Russians in general.\n\nSo how, then, to account for the country’s current pro-Russia stance?\n\nFirst off, it’s important to highlight that Hungarians have strikingly negative attitudes toward Ukraine. While Russia has harmed Hungary at various times in the past, Ukraine is seen as wronging Hungarians in the present.\n\nRelations between Budapest and Kyiv took a dramatically negative turn in recent years, when Ukraine introduced restrictions on national minorities intended to combat Russian influence. Hungarians claim minority communities in Transcarpathia — a region of Ukraine ceded by Hungary after World War I — faced hostility because of these policies.\n\nSince then, Orbán has been accused of fostering resentment. Tensions flared in 2018 over a video that apparently showed diplomats illegally issuing Hungarian passports to people in Transcarpathia. Later, in 2019, Hungary was accused of trying to influence the outcome of elections in the region, and blocked Ukraine’s NATO membership negotiations over the row.\n\nToday, from the Donbas to Kosovo, events are again proving the potency of nationalist narratives over lost territory and peoples separated by the claimed injustices of history. Yet, in the context of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the simple fact that many Hungarians have negative views of both Russians and Ukrainians is pertinent.\n\nAnd while these views have clearly influenced Hungarian government policy on both military aid and sanctions, other historical, economic and cultural factors have played their part as well.\n\nMany Hungarians worry about the gravitational pull that wars can have on neighboring countries. In the early 1990s, Hungary only narrowly escaped being sucked into the wars in the Balkans, after it was revealed that Budapest had been supplying tens of thousands of Kalashnikov rifles to Croat forces.\n\nOrbán’s economic model built around geopolitical ambivalence has influenced the country’s resistance to energy sanctions as well. Orbán describes Hungary as a “transit economy,” which can only thrive by drawing investment and opportunities from both East and West.\n\nIn this context, German-Russian energy cooperation is paradoxically believed to be fundamental to Hungarian national security. Orbán argues that the German-Russian energy axis remains the only way to stop Eastern Europe from becoming “dependent on the Americans” for energy and military protection. Though, his warning against American energy dominance does seem bizarre given that Hungary, Germany and others have had few qualms about relying on Russia.\n\nFinally, the economic arguments against cutting Russia off dovetails with Hungary’s growing cultural rift with the West. The progressive values rejected by Orbán are also mocked by Moscow, and Orbán has portrayed the country as emblematic of traditional mores. “Russians speak an old language. When we listen to them, it’s as if we are hearing the sounds of the past,” he said.\n\nWith Orbán presenting Western progressivism to Hungarians as dangerous, it should come as no surprise that Russia’s more traditional cultural values exert a certain appeal. As Attila Demkó, head of the Center for Geopolitics at Budapest’s Mathias Corvinus Collegium, says: “After 12 years of pressure from the EU and the West,” many Hungarians fall into the trap of feeling that “if the West is ‘bad,’ there must be some ‘truth’ in what Russia is doing.”\n\nAnd as Orbán voters believe they’ve been demonized by their supposed Western allies in recent years, why, they might ask, should they back a sanctions program?\n\nHungary’s stance on the Ukraine war isn’t based on popular pro-Russia social currents. Rather, it is the result of historical and recent political factors, many of which have been shaped by Orbán himself.\n\nSimply put, Hungary isn’t pro-Russia. But even so, President Vladimir Putin’s invasion hasn’t made it pro-Ukraine either.",

    "Hungary decree says abortion-seekers must listen to fetal vital signs": "Listen 4 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nPregnant people seeking abortions in Hungary will now be required to observe fetal vital signs, under a new decree passed by the right-wing government that took effect Thursday. Under the decree, issued Monday, health care providers must present women with “fetal vital signs presented in a clearly identifiable manner” before going ahead with an abortion. Doctors must sign a report saying they have done so.\n\n“Nearly two-thirds of Hungarians associate the beginning of a child’s life with the first heartbeat,” the Interior Ministry said in a statement on Monday, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe move marks the latest effort by Hungary’s far-right to promote conservative social values. Abortion was legalized in Hungary in 1953, and pregnant people can obtain the procedure during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy for social or medical reasons. That time limit can be extended under certain circumstances, including if there is more than a 50 percent likelihood of fetal defects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHungary’s abortion law is relatively liberal compared to many other countries. But abortion rights groups say mandatory counseling sessions and other administrative barriers seek to dissuade women from obtaining abortions, even when it is legal for them to do so.\n\nThe latest amendment to the abortion rules, passed in 1992, enshrined the necessity of protecting “fetal life that begins with conception” — a stance codified in Hungary’s 2012 constitution. Medication abortion, via pills, has been illegal since 2012.\n\nThe right-wing government of Viktor Orban, who has served as prime minister since 2010, has offered financial incentives to encourage couples to have more children. But the new decree marks its first significant change to abortion rules.\n\nDuro Dora, a member of parliament from the far-right Our Home Movement who campaigned for the measure, hailed the decree as a victory on Monday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“A chance at life: from now on mothers will listen to the heartbeat of the fetus!” she wrote in a Facebook post, adding: “Let’s make it clear: our lives begin at the moment of conception and are equivalent to anyone else’s, it’s important for everyone to realize this.”\n\nMedical experts take issue with the use of the term “fetal heartbeat” early on in a pregnancy. Cardiac activity can be detected around six weeks into pregnancy. But the sound that can be observed on an ultrasound is in fact produced by the ultrasound machine, experts say — and signs of flickering reflect electrical activity produced by the embryo, not a functional heart.\n\nOpposition politicians in Hungary and abortion rights advocates condemned the decree this week. Timea Szabo, a left-wing member of parliament, called the new requirement “unacceptable” in a statement Wednesday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Aborting a pregnancy is a terribly difficult and complex decision for every woman,\" she said. “It is highly insensitive to aggravate this process with further traumatizing measures, and it puts a significant additional burden on the health system that is struggling to survive from the foundation.”\n\nThe International Planned Parenthood Federation said the requirement “has no medical purpose and serves only to humiliate women.”\n\n“It will make accessing abortion more burdensome,” the organization said in a statement. “The new legislation was issued as a fait accompli by the government in Hungary without any expert or public consultation and without hearing from women.”\n\nThe Hungarian Medical Chamber, the leading doctors’ association in Hungary, said the decree does not conflict with its code of ethics, describing the rule in a statement Wednesday as essentially an administrative change. But the group voiced disappointment at the lack of consultation with experts and societal stakeholders before the government published the new rule.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPatent, a Hungarian women’s rights group, plans to protest the new decree on Sept. 28.\n\nThe Hungarian decree mirrors “heartbeat bills” passed in U.S. states including Georgia, Texas, Ohio, South Carolina and Tennessee, which the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade enabled to take effect. Republican lawmakers in the United States have backed away from a push for a national “heartbeat ban” that would have outlawed abortion as soon as cardiac activity is detected.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

    "Hungary’s clean energy transition is the key to reach energy independence": "Hungary’s transition to clean energy can enable it to achieve greater energy security and independence as it navigates the supply challenges that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has created for countries across Europe, according to a new in-depth policy review by the International Energy Agency.\n\nHungary has a strong starting point for its energy transition thanks to rapid growth of solar PV and a solid base of nuclear power. But it still has considerable work ahead to achieve its objectives for emissions reductions and energy sovereignty.\n\nSince the IEA’s last in-depth energy policy review in 2017, Hungary has increased its climate ambitions. In 2020, it became one of the first countries in Central Europe to put a carbon neutrality goal for 2050 into law and presented a long-term National Clean Development Strategy the following year. Hungary is aiming for 90% of its electricity generation to come from low-carbon sources by 2030.\n\nHowever, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has created a new set of energy security challenges in Europe. In response to the current global energy crisis, Hungary declared a state of energy emergency in July 2022 that allowed the government to increase domestic gas and coal production, secure additional gas imports from Russia and increase the output of the Mátra coal power plant. The government is also considering extending the lifetime of the four reactors at the country’s Paks nuclear power plant, which guarantees almost 50% of Hungary’s electricity supply.\n\n“Prioritising energy efficiency and renewables is a pragmatic approach that aligns with Hungary’s energy and climate goals in the short term and the long term. It can avoid increases in both fossil fuel imports and emissions,” said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol as the IEA released the report today.\n\nAttila Steiner, Hungary's State Secretary for Energy and Climate Policy, said: “Hungary has a strong commitment to renewables. As the next step, the government's priority is to upgrade the national grid to be capable of integrating the rapidly growing electric capacity generated by weather-dependent energy sources. However, to guarantee supply security and reach our ambitions climate goals, it is imperative to maintain or even increase our reliable and emission-free nuclear capacity as well.”\n\nAs a landlocked country, Hungary is today heavily reliant on Russia for natural gas, oil and nuclear fuel imports and new nuclear investment. The IEA review calls on Hungary to reduce fossil fuel consumption and diversify its energy sources towards a broader portfolio of renewables by drawing on the considerable potential of its wind and geothermal energy resources as well as extending the lifetime of existing reactors, where safety permits.\n\nAt the same time, Hungary should make the best use possible of its energy market interconnections, which it has significantly increased in recent years, to get energy supplies from diverse routes, sources and suppliers. The IEA report highlights that Hungary has a critical role to play in the major task of improving Central and Eastern European countries’ links to regional gas storage sites and new LNG terminals elsewhere in the European Union.\n\nThe IEA report recommends that the Hungarian government adopt additional targets and policies to lower fossil fuel consumption, increase energy efficiency and promote investment in clean energy technologies, skills and jobs. Paying close attention to ensuring a fair transition, including providing adequate support for people and communities associated with the Mátra coal plant, will be crucial to secure a smooth phase-out of coal.\n\n“A stronger focus on investment in clean energy technologies is critical,” Dr Birol said. “Hungary has a huge opportunity to develop hydrogen for industrial sectors. Continued investment in developing its solar PV, geothermal and wind resources will allow Hungary to reduce its reliance on natural gas and coal in both heating and power generation. Hungary possesses the technologies it needs to advance its transition toward a clean and more secure energy system, which in turn will improve regional energy security.”",
    "Russia’s Gazprom Offers Extra Gas Supplies To Hungary, Cutting Off Deliveries To Other Countries": "SOURCE:kremlin.ru\n\nHungary signed a deal with Russia for additional gas supplies in September and October. The agreement will send up to 5.8 million cubic meters of gas a day to Hungary on top of the contract quantity already in force. “Representatives of Gazprom and the Hungarian government have signed an appropriate agreement,” Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto announced on August 31. The minister pointed out that in August Hungary already received 2.6 million cubic meters of additional gas deliveries per day, which will be increased from September 1 to a maximum of 5.8 million cubic meters per day thanks to the agreement with Gazprom. More gas will reach Hungary from Serbia. Under the 15-year deal signed back in September 2021, Gazprom would ship 4.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas to Hungary annually, via two routes: 3.5 billion cubic meters via Serbia and 1 billion cubic meters via Austria. Szijjarto traveled to Moscow last month, seeking 700 million cubic meters of gas on top of an existing long-term supply deal with Russia. Gazprom started to increase gas supplies to Hungary this month, adding to previously agreed deliveries via the Turkstream pipeline. Hungary’s chief diplomat said the country would not vote for any sanctions that will make the transport of natural gas or oil from Russia to Hungary impossible. Since Russia invaded Ukraine, Hungary has obstructed the EU’s sanctions policy, notably for energy policy and military assistance for war-torn Ukraine but not only. On the same day Hungary discussed extra gas supplies with Gazprom, the Hungarian foreign minister spoke out against a possible visa ban on Russians. Hungary was one of the EU states to veto this decision. The European Union has decided not to impose a blanket ban on visas for Russian tourists, but instead to suspend a 2007 visa facilitation deal. In practice, the number of new visa applications will reduce while it will take longer to obtain visas. On August 31, when Russia announced an increase in gas supplies to Hungary, Gazprom halted natural gas supplies to Germany via the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline. Gazprom on August 18 said it would stop the flow of gas via the pipeline to Europe, citing the need to carry out repairs. German says it is impossible due to technical reasons. In recent weeks, the Russian energy major reduced the amount of gas flowing through a major pipeline from Russia to Europe to 20 percent of full capacity. Gazprom had suspended gas flows to French gas company Engie from September 1 due to failure to pay for supplies in full. This little affects France’s gas supplies. Russia now accounts for less than 4 percent of Engie’s gas imports while French gas storage facilities are now up to 90 percent full. By early November, this could be 100 percent. Unlike Germany, France has diversified its gas deliveries, taking some from North Africa and benefitting from liquefied natural gas supplies. Not incidentally, Gazprom’s recent moves have been linked to a drop in gas prices on the Amsterdam stock exchange after Germany was reported to fill its facilities faster than planned. The outage for maintenance on Nord Stream 1 means that no gas will flow to Germany, perhaps longer than until September 3. Gazprom has seen higher profits in recent months––despite the war in Ukraine and Western sanctions. The gas major said it had made a record €41.63 billion in net profit.",

    "Hungary's bakers feel the heat as bread prices skyrocket": "The cost of bread is much more expensive now in EU countries than before the start of the Ukraine conflict; both nations are major exporters of grains and fertilizers. The fighting halted exports from the Black Sea for months, disrupting global markets and driving the price of bread to record levels.\n\nBut according to Eurostat, among the countries in the bloc, Hungary has seen the sharpest increase in bread prices, which is why bread makers there are feeling the heat.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nIran promises 'transparent' Amini investigation\n\nFashion icon, war child, mother - life of a Queen\n\nChinese student comes to soprano's rescue\n\nThey say the cost of raw materials needed to make their products has shot up since last year, forcing them to pass on the cost to customers.\n\n\"We use french butter, and a lot of the materials we use come from outside of Hungary, and they are labeled in euros,\" said David Marton, co-owner of Harom Tarka Macska bakeries in Budapest. \"So there is an automatic increase in the prices of the raw materials,\" he adds.\n\nAccording to an EU commissioned survey, the average price of bread was 18 percent higher in August 2022 than the previous year. In Hungary, however, the price of bread rose by a whopping 66 percent during the same time period.\n\nBut the global surge in wheat prices is not the only factor driving up the cost of bread in Hungary. Record-high inflation and a weak national currency, the forint, is leaving local bakers with little options but to charge more for their baked goods.\n\nAndras Timar heads one of the largest restaurant consulting firms in Budapest. He says a major factor pushing up costs is not just ingredients - it's the rising cost of energy. Some of his clients rely on local bakeries for their products, and the surge in prices is affecting them all.\n\n\"Before it was 20 to 30 euros for your average oven energy consumption. Now it's easily 200 to 300 euros a day. Can you imagine that!\" says Andras Timar, CEO of Welldon Consulting group in Budapest.\n\nThe cost of utilities is burning profits fast in local bakeries.

    "Hungary backs down on push to lift EU sanctions on 3 Russian oligarchs — for now": "Hungary has, for now, dropped its demand to lift sanctions imposed by the European Union on three Russian oligarchs — a push that had threatened to derail the process for renewing the penalties, as POLITICO had reported on Tuesday.\n\nThe EU must periodically review and renew its time-limited sanctions against individuals, imposed at the outbreak of Russia’s war in Ukraine, or they will lapse. Ahead of Wednesday's meeting of EU envoys, the Czech presidency of the Council of the EU reached an agreement with the Hungarians to avoid a blockade on the extension process by postponing the discussion on the three names to the next time the list must be reviewed in a couple of months.\n\nThis avoided a clash at Wednesday's meeting, according to three EU diplomats. Budapest's push ahead of the talks had infuriated other EU countries, which have bitter memories of Hungarian leader Viktor Orbán’s hold-up on the EU’s oil ban earlier this year.\n\nAccording to two diplomats, the Russian businessmen concerned are Alisher Usmanov, Petr Aven and Viktor Rashnikov.\n\nThe Council will now take the next technical steps to make sure the sanctions list gets prolonged by the deadline of mid-September.",
    "Hungary breeds unquiet on Ukraine’s western front": "Orbán himself is advocating for a change of course in Ukraine | Attila Kisbenedek/AFP via Getty Images\n\nPress play to listen to this article Voiced by Amazon Polly\n\nBUDAPEST — The Western alliance is pledging to support Ukraine till the bitter end. Hungary is openly calling on Kyiv to give up.\n\nAcross Europe, capitals are funneling Ukraine weapons to fuel a critical counteroffensive. And they’re broadly insisting Ukraine will decide when it is time to start peace negotiations.\n\nNot Hungary.\n\nThough Hungary is a member of both NATO and the European Union, it has declined to join other Western allies in providing Kyiv with military support. Instead, it has banned weapon deliveries from crossing through Hungary into next-door Ukraine.\n\nWhile Budapest has signed off EU sanctions, it first insisted some of them be watered down. And even as fighting raged in eastern Ukraine this summer, Hungarian officials traveled to Moscow to negotiate a deal for extra gas supplies.\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán himself is advocating for a change of course in Ukraine. The West’s focus, he said in a speech in July, “should not be on winning the war, but on negotiating peace and making a good peace offer.”\n\n“The task of the European Union is not to stand alongside either the Russians or the Ukrainians, but to stand between Russia and Ukraine,” he said.\n\nWestern assistance, he has argued, is only prolonging the conflict. “Sanctions and arms deliveries won’t lead to results,” Orbán told local radio in August. “When one rushes to put out a fire, one doesn’t bring along a flamethrower.”\n\nOrbán’s stance on Ukraine — coming as European leaders worry about war fatigue and a winter of spiking energy prices and inflation — has raised concerns in Kyiv and abroad that Hungary could prove to be the West’s weakest link as it seeks to manage the largest military crisis in Europe since World War II.\n\nOfficials acknowledge that Budapest does not always stand alone, with other capitals sometimes sharing at least part of Hungary’s concerns. But as the EU and NATO allies seek new ways to support Ukraine in a longer-term conflict, Budapest’s reluctance will be a persistent thorn in the Western alliance’s side.\n\nOrbán “doesn’t give a damn about Ukraine,” said András Simonyi, a former Hungarian ambassador to NATO and the United States.\n\nHungary’s position on the war “is not just a nuisance — this is a threat,” he said. “I don’t think NATO or the European Union is taking this seriously. And I think it’s a mistake.”\n\nCloser to the Kremlin than Kyiv\n\nSince returning to power in 2010 Orbán has nurtured closer ties with the Kremlin | Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n\nHungary and Ukraine may share a border, but Budapest has long put more emphasis on its relationship with Moscow.\n\n“Hungary’s Ukraine policy has always been to a certain extent subordinated to Hungary’s Russia policy,” said András Rácz, an associate fellow at the German Council on Foreign Relations. He pointed to energy dependency and investments in Russia as driving Budapest’s calculus.\n\nOrbán began his political career as an anti-Soviet liberal. But since returning to power in 2010 he has nurtured closer ties with the Kremlin, holding frequent meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin and striking a controversial deal with a Russian state-owned company to expand an existing nuclear power plant. On August 26, more than six months into Russia’s full-scale assault on Ukraine, Hungary issued a permit for the project to go ahead.\n\nAt the same time, Hungary’s relationship with Ukraine, particularly over the past five years, has been rocky.\n\nBudapest has repeatedly clashed with Kyiv over education and language policies it says are infringing on the rights of over 100,000 Hungarian speakers living in western Ukraine. As a result, prior to Russia’s full-scale invasion, Budapest repeatedly blocked NATO from holding ministerial-level meetings with Ukraine.\n\nMuch of Orbán’s Ukraine strategy — both before and after February 24 — is driven by Hungarian domestic politics.\n\nBlaming Kyiv — and the West — for the war plays into Orbán’s electoral narrative, said political scientist and re:constitution fellow Edit Zgut-Przybylska. “It nicely fits the Euroskeptic populism of Fidesz, claiming that the corrupt imperialist West is endangering stability in Central and Eastern Europe,” she said.\n\nAhead of an election this past April, officials from the ruling Fidesz party claimed — falsely — that Ukraine was trying to meddle in the proceedings. In his victory speech, Orbán even cited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as one of his adversaries.\n\nOrbán also seems to be playing a longer geopolitical game, banking on the rise of like-minded forces on both sides of the Atlantic, according to Simonyi, the former ambassador.\n\nThe prime minister — under fire from Western allies for undermining Hungary’s democratic institutions — often speaks about a relative decline in western power and the need to build relationships in other parts of the world.\n\nThe results of the upcoming congressional midterms in the United States, Orbán said in his radio interview, “could influence U.S. foreign policy — including on the question of war and peace. I’m counting on this happening.”\n\nSimonyi said Orbán is seeking the “best of all worlds” — an American populist, right-wing government that would leave him alone, as well as relationships with Russia and China, which don’t care what happens domestically in Hungary.\n\nWar changes everything — for a time\n\nWith the West rallying behind Zelenskyy, Orbán has had little choice but to fall in line | Nicolas Maeterlinck/BELGA MAG/AFP via Getty Images\n\nFor the moment, however, Russia’s February assault has changed the calculus. With the West rallying behind Zelenskyy, Orbán has had little choice but to fall in line.\n\nWhen EU leaders agreed to grant Ukraine candidate status, opening the door to eventual EU membership, the Hungarian leader did not stand in their way. And while Hungary doesn’t allow weapons to cross into Ukraine, it does permit them to transit to other NATO countries, from where they can continue their journey toward the frontline. Budapest also quietly backed using an EU fund to reimburse countries sending Kyiv military equipment.\n\nHungarian officials say their country is in line with the Western alliance. “There are many myths about the Hungarian position,” said one senior Hungarian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He described Budapest’s stance on sanctions, especially when it comes to energy, as a reflection of the country’s “geographic and economic realities.”\n\n“We were not the only ones having national caveats,” the official said.\n\nBut there are still concerns. “Hungary is performing only the necessary minimum,” said Rácz, of the German Council on Foreign Relations. “I think it’s not breaking the consensus, it’s not breaking the unity,” he said. “It is weakening the unity.”\n\nOfficials fret over an alliance straining\n\nBudapest’s response to the invasion has already further isolated the Hungarian government within Europe | Anatolli Stepanov/AFP via Getty Images\n\nBudapest’s response to the invasion has already further isolated the Hungarian government within Europe and cooled the country’s relationship with its closest ally, Poland.\n\nBut now, over six months into the war, the Western alliance’s unity on Ukraine is also straining. There are fissures between Europe’s Russia hawks — in particular the Baltic states — and some western capitals on issues such as Russian visa bans and how to proceed with future sanctions packages.\n\nThere is also, some officials say, a discrepancy between Washington’s expansive support for Kyiv and Europe’s relatively more modest assistance. And war fatigue fears are infiltrating capitals ahead of a tough winter.\n\nAmid this landscape, Western partners fret that Hungary — as such an outlier — risks undermining the EU’s unity and security policies.\n\n“The Hungarians are practicing their own imperial policy towards countries surrounding them where there is Hungarian minority,” said one Central European official.\n\n“Orbán needs to fund his generous social politics by selling out European security,” the official adding, describing the Hungarian government’s behavior “as a Russian and Chinese Trojan horse.”\n\nHungary, according to the official, will continue resisting some efforts to help Ukraine — but within the limits of how “they were acting until now.”\n\n“They are only thinking of themselves, only acting for themselves,” this person said.\n\nThe Ukrainian government, meanwhile, has moderated its public criticism of Hungary over the past weeks, after vocal criticism from Zelenskyy in the first months of the war.\n\nBut concerns in Kyiv persist.\n\nHungary’s leadership has put its “political internal agenda and agenda of their Russian friends forward as opposed to unity and values — unfortunately,” said Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze, chair of the Ukrainian Parliament’s committee on EU integration.\n\n“There are political forces in different European and NATO countries that actually are also working to undermine the unity,” Klympush-Tsintsadze noted, adding that in Hungary, these forces are in power.\n\nThe Hungarian government’s approach, she said, “worries me — how it will further undermine the common response.”",

    "EU Commission still probing Hungary's Covid recovery plan": "The EU Commission said on Tuesday (30 August) it wanted to conclude its assessment of Hungary for EU pandemic recovery funds \"as fast as possible\" — which have so far been held up by rule-of-law concerns.\n\nThe EU executive, however, did not comment in detail on Hungarian media reports that the government of Viktor Orbán has been already making the funds available — pre-financed from the national budget, to be covered later by the EU.\n\nStudent or retired? Then this plan is for you.\n\nThe reports suggested the Orbán government is confident it will secure the EU funds that will cover the pre-prefinancing.\n\nThe reports \"no way influence the way we are discussing issues with Hungary\", the commission's spokesman Eric Mamer said on Tuesday.\n\n\"While we made progress on a number of issues over the last months, there are still a number of points that remain open, including anti-corruption, and also very importantly, adequate audit and control arrangements and well as education measures,\" another commission spokesperson added.\n\n\"We are working to conclude our assessment as fast as possible,\" the spokesperson said, adding that the executive is still in discussion with Budapest.\n\nHungary had been allocated €5.8bn from the EU Covid-19 recovery fund, but has been unable to access it as the commission made it dependent on several conditions to better keep track of the funds and fight corruption.\n\nIn a parallel procedure, Hungary also faces potential financial penalties over rule-of-law issues, including public tender procedures that fall short on anti-corruption safeguards.\n\nLast week Hungary said it will amend several laws by the end of October, which had been criticised by the commission, if an agreement on the funds is reached.\n\n\"We have already submitted part of these [package of legal changes] and made promises for several more law amendments if the deal with the commission is signed,\" Orban's chief of staff, Gergely Gulyás, was quoted as saying by Reuters last Tuesday (23 August).\n\nHungary's economy has been under pressure due to rising energy prices and inflation, worsened by a weakening forint currency, putting the onus on the government to find an agreement with the EU over the funds.\n\nIn July, Hungary's chief negotiator, former EU commissioner Tibor Navracsics, told Bloomberg that Budapest still needs to \"build confidence\" over the next months to address corruption and rule-of-law concerns.\n\nOrbán has been accused of syphoning EU funds to his cronies to solidify his grip on power.\n\nA draft report on the state of Hungary's democracy by the European Parliament described Hungary as a \"hybrid regime of electoral autocracy\".\n\nThe report will be voted on by MEPs in mid-September.\n\nPolish move\n\nAt the same time, the commission said it stands by its decision to approve Poland's recovery plan — after four associations of European judges asked the EU court to annul it.\n\nOn Sunday, the judges asked the EU General Court to scrap the commission decision, and the subsequent decision by the council of ministers to approve the Polish plan.\n\nThe judges argue that the commission disregarded a decision by the EU's top court in July 2021 that Polish judges, suspended as a result of unlawful changes in the Polish judiciary by the country's nationalist government, should be reinstated immediately.\n\nThe commission, however, had accepted in talks with Warsaw that the suspended judges be subject to a review procedure of more than a year, with an uncertain outcome.",

At the same time, he said that Hungary offers a predictable and politically stable environment.\n\n“The quality of human resources is becoming the key factor in the race for investments. It’s not an exaggeration to say that Hungary’s competitiveness and future are greatly dependent on universities and the quality of the work being done there,” the Minister added.\n\nMoreover, in March, the Minister of innovation and technology László Palkovics revealed that the government has helped with 200 billion forints or €539.0 million in developing infrastructure and science parks in twenty Hungarian universities, which are either run by the state or by foundations supported by the government.\n\nAccording to him, the financing is the first phase of a development scheme of 2,700 billion forints.

    "Brussels considers cutting Hungary out of global tax rate bill": "Hungary’s veto on the EU's tax bill is embarrassing for Brussels | Kenzo Tribouillard/AFP via Getty Images\n\nPRAGUE — The European Commission is asking member governments whether they’d support a plan to cut Hungary out of the EU’s bid to introduce a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15 percent.\n\nFour officials from EU national finance ministries told POLITICO the Commission officials have been putting calls into capitals to gauge their appetite for a so-called enhanced-cooperation deal that would nullify Budapest’s veto of the initiative.\n\nTax bills require unanimity to get through Brussels’ legislative machinery, giving any EU country of any size the power to block them. But enhanced cooperation would allow member countries that favor the measure to progress without having to reach unanimity — leaving Budapest out in the cold.\n\nIf there’s support against Hungary, the EU’s executive arm could unveil the enhanced-cooperation initiative by the time finance ministers meet in Luxembourg next month for their monthly Ecofin meeting, one of the officials said.\n\n“Implementing the historic international agreement on minimum taxation remains a high priority for the European Commission,” a spokesman wrote in an email to POLITICO when asked about the phone calls. “We are in close contact with Member States with a view to delivering on that objective.”\n\nHungary’s sole veto against the tax rate is embarrassing for Brussels. EU institutions had hoped to be quick about implementing the global initiative and set the pace for over 130 countries that also backed the accord, including the United States, China, India and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development orchestrated the initiative in a package of corporate tax reforms, designed to render tax havens useless and ensure global companies — and tech giants — pay their fair share of dues.\n\nThe two-pronged package is made up of the tax rate for multinationals and a measure that’ll ensure the world’s 100 biggest companies pay taxes on their operations and sales around the globe.\n\nLeaders from G20 countries rubber-stamped the package in the fall of last year but the OECD is still putting the final touches on the global levy for the 100 biggest companies.\n\nHostage-taking\n\nThe Commission copy-pasted the tax rate into an EU bill in December and EU finance ministers almost agreed on the text in April were it not for Poland.\n\nTreasury officials were quick to accuse Warsaw of holding the bill hostage over a rule-of-law dispute over which the Commission was withholding Poland's share of the EU’s €800 billion post-pandemic recovery fund.\n\nThe dispute with Warsaw was settled in June. But Hungary then followed suit at the 11th hour amid its own frustrations of not getting access to its recovery fund cash. The Czech finance minister visited his Hungarian counterpart in August to discuss the deadlock after taking on the administrative duties of the EU’s six-month presidency in Council — but left empty-handed.\n\nPatience is wearing thin with Budapest, said treasury officials, who were tentatively supportive of the Commission’s plan — although nothing has been decided yet.\n\nFrance and Germany have voiced support for the strategy in the past. There’s concern among smaller countries, however, that this strategy could embolden the Commission to keep using enhanced cooperation to circumvent them if they oppose tax bills in the future.\n\nBut the tax rate needs to happen to ensure that global momentum for the OECD accord continues, they add. If not, the fear is that the U.S. will fail to implement the deal, especially if Republicans win a majority of seats in Congress in the upcoming midterm elections.",

    "Hungary to launch national consultation on EU sanctions against Russia": "Hungary’s ruling Fidesz-KDNP party alliance is calling on the government to launch a new \"National Consultation\" on European Union sanctions against Russia, Mate Kocsis, the leader of the parliamentary group of governing Fidesz, announced on September 22 after the closed faction meeting of the ruling party.\n\nKocsis said they are asking the government to conduct a public survey so that Hungarians can have their say on the matter, making them the first in Europe who can express their opinion on the topic.\n\nKocsis said he expects from the survey that the governing parties will find out what the Hungarians think about the EU sanctions against Russia, and they will be able to refer to the opinions of the Hungarians in upcoming European debates. This is an attempt to put political pressure on the European Union, he added.\n\nThe largest opposition party DK said it is pointless to consult on EU sanctions against Russia, which the PM has approved \"one by one\".\n\nThe national consultation surveys used by the government since 2011 are widely seen as a political and communicational tool to thematise public discourse and show support for the government on a given topic. It is also a way to build up a database of supporters. As the cabinet is spending billions in surveying the public mood, the outcome of the surveys, based on simplified questions, reflects the government’s position. So far 11 such consultations were held, using billions in taxpayer money for what is in effect propaganda for the ruling party.\n\nThe war between Ukraine and Russia is no longer a local war, sanctions have turned it into a global economic war, Hungary’s strongman told MPs at the closed fraction meeting on Wednesday. He asked the members of his faction to do everything possible to ensure that Europe withdraws sanctions by the end of the year at the latest.\n\nOrban has also signalled that he will try to oppose an eigth round of EU sanctions against the Kremlin, though up until now, Hungary has gone along with the sanctions, though it won concessions on the crude oil boycott that takes effect in December.\n\nAs inflation is reaching a multi-decade high, and the energy crisis is hitting households and businesses, Hungary’s government has ratcheted up its stance against the sanctions against Russia.\n\nViktor Orban has repeatedly blamed EU sanctions for runaway prices and said that if the sanctions were lifted, energy prices would immediately halve and inflation would fall.\n\nBut as analysts had pointed out, Hungary’s inflation had been one of the highest in Europe before the war and the government introduced price caps on fuel and half a dozen food staples before the election.\n\nOrban’s latest move to hold a survey on sanctions is another way of shifting the blame for economic woes following a procyclical and expansive fiscal policy in recent years and a pre-election spending splurge that left the state budget in a difficult position, according to analysts.",
    "Italy downs Hungary to reach Nations League finals": "Heading into Tuesday's (AEST) final fixture in Group A3, Hungary needed only a draw to complete a remarkable run through the competition to next year's four-team fight for the top prize.\n\nBut Roberto Mancini's European champion, still smarting from its failure to qualify for the 2022 World Cup, delivered a composed performance to break its opponent's hearts in a taut encounter.\n\nMarco Rossi's side can nevertheless take pride in its achievements, following a campaign that saw it defeat England twice and Germany once to finish second in the end.\n\nAmid raucous home support urging Hungary on to make history, it had looked bullish from the off, with Dominik Szoboszlai offering an early threat for the host.\n\nBut Hungary was undone by its lacklustre awareness at the back, and when Wilfried Gnonto pressed Adam Nagy's soft back-pass off Peter Gulacsi, Raspadori was able to round the prone keeper for a simple finish.\n\nItaly held a one-goal lead through to the interval, and it took just seven minutes for it to double it afterwards, with Dimarco getting across Loic Nego at the far post to crash Bryan Cristante's cross into the roof of the net.\n\nHungary pushed for a response late on, but none was forthcoming – and with the full-time whistle, it was the Azzurri who booked their spot alongside Croatia and the Netherlands for next year's finale.",

    "Hungary: Shocking confession in Roma murder case garners zero interest": "The perpetrators ambushed their victims, set their homes on fire and then shot them as they sought to escape the flames. Or they killed them in their sleep. In all, the neo-Nazi group killed six people, among them a small child, and injured a further 55, most seriously. The only motivation for their crimes was the fact that their victims were Roma.\n\nThe right-wing terrorist series of murders in 2008/2009 targeted members of the Roma community and was the gravest set of racist crimes committed in Hungary's recent history — on par with the NSU murders in Germany that killed 10, among them 9 with a migrant background, and left one injured between 2000 and 2007. Here, too, the victims were targeted because they were foreigners. The murders in Hungary were carried out in the final months of the country's Socialist-Liberal government, as Hungary drifted further into corruption and political chaos. Just months later, Viktor Orban was elected to power with a two-thirds majority.\n\nThe case of Hungary's Roma murders was never entirely solved. Nevertheless, three perpetrators were handed life sentences in 2014, and an accomplice was given 13 years in prison. Still, despite ample evidence of their guilt — including DNA samples collected at various crime scenes — all of the men involved were unflinching in their claims of innocence. Only one of the four, Arpad Kiss, considered the leader of the group and the main suspect in the case, ever spoke of the crime in public, each time proclaiming his innocence.\n\nRoma were targeted in their homes and killed in their sleep\n\nAccidental murderer?\n\nNow, out of the blue, he has given a confession. Some 13 years on, the Budapest daily newspaper Magyar Nemzet — considered an unofficial megaphone for Prime Minister Viktor Orban and his Fidesz party — has published an interview with Kiss. The interview, dated August 31, provided a confession that was just as confusing as it was shocking.\n\nIn it, Kiss said: \"The crimes took place. We committed them.\" Although he described the crimes as a \"mistake,\" he never expressed true regret or remorse. Nor did the interviewer ever bother with follow-up questions. Kiss also described the group's proclamations of innocence before the court as a \"mistake.\"\n\nAlthough he was presented as the main perpetrator and organizer of the group, Kiss denied he any leadership position. He claimed he simply wanted to help his younger brother, and only became involved in the murders by chance. The bizarre climax of the interview came when Kiss suggested the last two murders in April and August 2009 could have been avoided if investigators had worked more effectively.\n\nUnnamed accomplices\n\nBut that wasn't the only statement that made the interview so remarkable. For the first time, Kiss publicly confirmed what most who have followed the case long suspected: accomplices and supporters enabled the murders by providing cash, guns and logistics. In the interview, Kiss referred to two helpers: A local politician from the far-right Jobbik party, and an employee at a gun shop who apparently had access to confidential information from the Interior Ministry through a relative.\n\nKiss did not name names, nor did he offer further information, though he claimed to have provided details on both accomplices to Hungarian investigators back in 2020. But official investigations went nowhere. \"We were held responsible, but those two went free,\" said Kiss in the interview. \"I find that shocking.\"\n\nHungarian court jails men for killing Roma (06.08.2013)\n\nNo reaction to the interview\n\nKiss said he hopes his sentence will be reviewed. He and the two other perpetrators were handed \"life\" sentences, which means at least 40 years behind bars in Hungary. In October 2021, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that practice illegal. Should Hungary change course, Kiss could go free in 2034.\n\nAlthough the Roma murders represent a uniquely racist, far-right crime spree, reaction to the interview has been nonexistent. A few media outlets offered short summaries, but neither Orban or his fellow Fidesz politicians have addressed it, nor has anyone from the opposition party. Journalists have also remained silent.\n\n\"No political side in Hungary has any interest in completely investigating and solving the Roma murders, that is consensus,\" filmmaker and journalist Andras B. Vagvolgyi told DW. Vagvolgyi is one of the few people who know the case inside and out. He attended the trial over the course of years, and published a book on the crimes in 2016. He has even been in contact with Arpad Kiss over the years, conducting yet unpublished interviews with him and working on a film about the crimes.\n\nVagvolgyi is convinced that a fundamental investigation into the case could prove the perpetrators had accomplices in the security and intelligence communities. He said a general lack of will to get to the bottom of the case, as well as a latent antiziganism, are both impeding closure. \"Many politicians have told me that people should finally just forget about it,\" said Vagvolgyi.\n\nPoliticians don't want a new investigation, and say people should just forget about the case\n\nAccomplices let off?\n\nLiberal ex-politician Jozsef Gulyas, who together with friends and acquaintances helps survivors of the crimes, agrees. \"Sadly, hardly anyone is still interested in the case. The victims are all but forgotten,\" he told DW. Gulyas was a member of the Parliamentary Committee on National Security that investigated the case back in 2009 and 2010.\n\n\"In light of Arpad Kiss' public statements,\" said Gulyas, \"the most important thing now would be to open a new investigation and demand intelligence agencies turn over whatever information they have on the case.\"\n\nIt remains unclear if that will happen. Neither Hungarian Police nor the National Bureau of Investigation replied to a DW query on whether a new investigation was planned, nor to the question of whether the investigation of accomplices was concluded unsuccessfully, as Kiss claimed.\n\nWhat role did the ex-prime minister play?\n\nPossible evidence that intelligence services were aware of events could be potentially explosive. For instance, Istvan Csontos, an informant for the Hungarian military's KBH security office, also happened to be the getaway driver in the last two attacks. He reportedly informed his contact at the KBH of his role, but that information is said to have not been passed on. Csontos was released from prison in August, after serving a 13-year sentence. He has never publicly spoken about the case.\n\nPolitical calculus may also be behind the prominent placement of the Kiss interview in a paper that is known as an unofficial media partner of the prime minister. In the interview, Kiss accused Socialist ex-Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany of having indirectly known about the crimes and quietly profiting from them. Gyurcsany is still active in politics, and is consistently the target of attacks from Orban and Fidesz. The former prime minister has never responded to calls to explain his ties to the case.\n\nThis article was translated from German by Jon Shelton",
    "Hortobágy will be renewed": "The Hortbágy National Park, Hungary’s UNESCO World Heritage site will be renewed. The national park’s management and the municipality of Hortobágy proposed a tender named “Hortobágy – Our World Heritage the Heath”. The goal is to develop the central part of the heritage site, providing a better experience for visitors.\n\nThe Hortobágy National Park is a true Hungarian experience. Whenever you think of Hungary, you probably conjure up images of horses, gray cattle, crane wells and wide lush meadows. Now it is time for Hortobágy to get a revamp, and thus, provide an even more memorable experience. The proposal’s deadline is in October, so they are still waiting for the offers.\n\nHowever, we have insight into what is being planned thanks to magyarepitok.hu. The development plan includes the restoration of the Szekérállás building. The Körszín building will be reconstructed and turned into an information point. Lastly, a comprehensive public utility upgrade can be expected.\n\nThe Szekérállás\n\nThe building is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage attribute and it is also under monument protection. While trying to reconstruct the original form of the roof and openings, they will be preserving the structure of the roof and the walls of the building. Inside, a complete modernisation is to be expected both from a utility and architectural perspective. An independent space will be made inside the building accommodating all the functions necessary to keep the building running, while the machinery will be located on the floor above.\n\nThe Körszín\n\nDuring the transformation of the building into a Touristic Information Point, it will be completely demolished. Following that, based on the needs of the new facility, it will be rebuilt in the same form. Essentially, from the outside, it will look the same, but from the inside, it will be modernised and reorganised. The new building will have 125 m² of public space and another 16 m² area inside. The surroundings will also change as new perennial plants and ornamental grass will be planted in the framework of complete landscaping. The water supply will be rethought and rainwater will be led back to the river.\n\nThe visitor centre, new roads and parking\n\nAlthough the visitor centre had been expanded and transformed in 2020, there is still some complementary work left to do. This will not be anything noticeable as most of the work had already been done. These additional upgrades will help to modernise the technical side of the building.\n\nNew parking spaces will be created along with a road leading to the local market square. This initiative also aims to finish all the necessary landscaping work to create a better environment. The whole project will affect an area of 11,600 m² to make the national park a modern and vibrant place to visit.\n\nRead also Hungary Helps: It’s factually clear that Christianity is the world’s most persecuted religion\n\nSource: magyarepitok.hu",

    "Ryanair cancels Hungary routes over windfall tax dispute": "BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Budget airline Ryanair announced Tuesday that it will cancel several routes through Hungary and cut flights on several more following a months-long dispute with the country’s government over a special windfall tax placed on airlines.\n\nThe Ireland-based company’s CEO, Michael O’Leary, said at a press conference in Hungary’s capital that Ryanair had planned to launch 10 new routes through Budapest and base an additional airplane at its airport this winter.\n\n“Sadly, however, those plans have now fallen at the altar of the Hungarian government’s decision to impose a ludicrous and idiotic excess profits tax on the airline sector, which has reported record losses,” O’Leary said.\n\nInstead of expanding its presence in Hungary as planned to more than 5 million passengers next year, Ryanair will eliminate eight of its previously operating 53 routes through Budapest while imposing frequency cuts on seven more, he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis will reduce the company’s yearly passenger load in Hungary from 4.5 million to under 4 million, he added.\n\nThe decision came in response to Hungary’s government fining the low-cost airline more than 750,000 euros ($753,000) in August for alleged consumer protection violations. The fine came after the company raised ticket prices to cope with a tax on what the government calls “extra profits” of industries ranging from airlines to banks.\n\nThe nationalist government argued that such industries have enjoyed windfall profits arising from soaring demand after the COVID-19 pandemic, and should contribute to the country’s economic recovery .\n\nBut on Tuesday, O’Leary said Ryanair had posted 1.26 billion euros in losses in the last two years, and that targeting it and other airlines with excess profits taxes was “inexplicable.”\n\n“We cannot get any explanation from the Hungarian government as to why an industry or a sector which is making record losses is being asked to pay excess profits,” O’Leary said.\n\nRyanair will appeal the “bogus” fine imposed on it by Hungary’s consumer protection authority in Hungarian courts, O’Leary said, adding that “we confidently expect we will lose,” but that the company will then appeal in European Union courts.\n\nHe also took a swipe at Hungary’s consumer protection agency, questioning its independence and accusing it of taking political cues from the Minister of Justice in imposing the fine.\n\n“It’s not too late for the Hungarian government to realize the error of their ways,” O’Leary said. “The future of Hungarian tourism and industry lies entirely on making Hungary an attractive destination and a low-cost, competitive destination here in Central Europe.”",
    "Hungary demands EU lift sanctions on 3 Russian oligarchs": "According to two diplomats, the Russian businessmen concerned include Alisher Usmanov, a former shareholder in Arsenal football club | Yuri Kochetkov/EPA-EFE\n\nHungary is again proving to be the roadblock when it comes to EU sanctions against Russia — this time by pushing for three Russian oligarchs to be removed from the sanctions list.\n\nThe EU has a deadline of September 15 to renew its measures against individuals who were sanctioned since the outbreak of Russia's war in Ukraine or they will lapse. Within the bloc, this extension was seen as a technical formality, as it has been with previous sanctions against Russia over Ukraine since 2014.\n\nBut Hungary has thrown a spanner in the works. Budapest has asked to remove three Russian nationals from the EU's sanctions list, according to four EU diplomats and officials who spoke to POLITICO on condition of anonymity. The move has infuriated other EU countries, which have bitter memories of Hungarian leader Viktor Orbán's hold-up on the EU's oil ban earlier this year.\n\nAccording to two of the diplomats, the Russian businessmen concerned are Alisher Usmanov, Petr Aven and Viktor Rashnikov.\n\nUsmanov made his fortune in mining and investments and is a former shareholder in Arsenal football club; Aven is a businessman and politician who led Russia's biggest commercial bank; and Rashnikov is an iron and steel billionaire.\n\nHungarian government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs said the EU would reach a joint decision on the sanctions list. \"The EU sanctions lists are constantly under review, and there are concerns time and again that the inclusion of certain persons or entities on the sanctions list is not sufficiently justified,\" he tweeted.\n\nHungary has also asked the EU to broaden the exception on sanctions for humanitarian aid. This has created fear among other EU countries that Budapest wants to create loopholes in EU sanctions at a time when the European Commission is trying to tighten the rules.\n\nEU envoys are set to discuss the war in Ukraine at their meeting on Wednesday. While the extension of the sanctions listings is not formally on the agenda, Hungary's demands will definitely be raised during the talks, given the outrage they have caused already, diplomats said.",

    "Hungary requires doctors to present women with fetal vital signs before abortion": "Owen Dyer Montreal\n\nDoctors in Hungary must provide women with “a clearly identifiable indication of fetal vital signs” before carrying out any abortion, according to a decree of the government led by Viktor Orban.\n\nThe rule came into force on 15 September, only three days after the decree was announced. Doctors must sign a document verifying that they complied with the rule for every abortion.\n\nAbortion in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy has been legal in Hungary since 1953, with later abortions permitted if fetal defects are judged probable. The Orban government wrote a new constitution in 2011 guaranteeing that “the life of a fetus will be protected from conception,” but this week’s decree is the first move to affect patients.\n\nDora Duro, a legislator with the far right opposition party Our Homeland, claimed on Facebook that it was her party’s proposal that the government had adopted. The decree broke a “decades old taboo” against “pro-life moves,” she wrote.\n\nSo-called fetal heartbeat laws have been a feature of anti-abortion legislation in the US. Early laws aimed to force the pregnant patient to listen to the ultrasound monitor in the hope that it would discourage them from proceeding with abortion. More stringent recent laws, like the Texas Heartbeat Act of 2021, prohibit physicians from providing abortion if they can detect “cardiac activity” in the fetus or embryo.\n\nHungary’s main doctors’ organisation, the Hungarian Medical Chamber, and the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) criticised the government for proceeding with no public consultation and no input from women or doctors. The new requirement “has no medical purpose and serves only to humiliate women,” said the IPPF.\n\nGynaecologists have pointed out that fetuses at the early stage of pregnancy when most abortions occur do not yet have working hearts, only clumps of cells sending electrical signals. The “heartbeat” sound is generated by the ultrasound monitor to represent these electric pulses. It is not a real sound of heart valves operating as is heard in an adult or child using a stethoscope.\n\nAs Hungary’s prime minister, Orban has employed almost no women in his cabinets, arguing that women are unable to handle the stress of Hungarian politics.\n\nHis nationalist government has stopped almost all immigration to the country, and he drew outrage in July when he said that Hungarians opposed the “mixing of races.” But with one of the world’s lowest fertility rates, at 1.45 children per woman, the approach has led to an ageing population and a declining workforce. A population of nearly 10 million today is on course to hit 8 million by 2050.\n\nOrban sought to wring more hours from the labour force with an unpopular law that allowed employers to compel overtime, dubbed the “slave law” by critics. He also offered tax incentives for fecundity, including a complete exemption from income tax for any woman who has four children.\n\nAfter winning re-election in 2018, Orban promised to “reach a comprehensive agreement with Hungarian women,” making it clear that he expected them to have more babies.\n\nHe said in 2019, “In all of Europe there are fewer and fewer children, and the answer of the West to this is migration. They want as many migrants to enter as they are missing kids, so that the numbers will add up. We Hungarians have a different way of thinking. Instead of just numbers, we want Hungarian children.”\n\nAbortion bans take effect in Indiana and West Virginia Meanwhile, in the US, abortion bans continue to be passed in conservative states following the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v Wade in June. As of 15 September two more states, Indiana and West Virginia, banned all abortions at any stage of pregnancy except in the case of rape, incest, threat to the mother’s life, or “fatal fetal anomaly,” although this last category is not clearly defined. Republican lawmakers in West Virginia, in passing their law, expressed frustration that it included exemptions for rape and incest, and lacked a criminal penalty for doctors. The Indiana law allows doctors to be imprisoned for up to six years if they provide an abortion or fail to file required reports. Thirteen states had “trigger bans” that came into effect when Roe v Wade was struck down. A further 13 are working on legislation and are likely to enact either blanket bans or bans after six weeks’ pregnancy, according to an analysis by the Guttmacher Institute.1 Republican senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina this week proposed a national abortion law that would ban the procedure after 15 weeks, which he described as a compromise solution. But his bill is unlikely to make headway in Congress, where his fellow Republicans are increasingly backing away from taking public anti-abortion stances following the negative public reaction to the Roe v Wade decision."
