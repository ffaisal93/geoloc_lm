    "Botswana pins hope on China-Africa linkage in solar energy": "Botswanan President Mokgweetsi Masisi speaks during the unveiling of solar street lights at Khuis village, Kgalagadi District, Botswana, Dec. 8, 2020. (Xinhua/Motlalepula)\n\nExperts and policymakers in Botswana have expressed hope that the China-Africa linkage in the use of solar energy technologies will spur the southern African country's transition from overreliance on coal for electricity generation.\n\nGABORONE, Sept. 26 (Xinhua) -- Experts and policymakers in Botswana have expressed hope that the China-Africa linkage in the use of solar energy technologies will spur the southern African country's transition from overreliance on coal for electricity generation.\n\nBotswana has embarked on an ambitious journey of transitioning from overreliance on coal for electricity generation toward increasing the share of renewable energies, said Lefoko Moagi, Botswana's Minister of Minerals and Energy, told Xinhua in a recent telephone interview.\n\nMoagi, who late last month attended the International Solar Alliance (ISA)'s fourth Regional Committee Meeting in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, said Botswana's quest for solar energy development could be realized through China's potential and involvement.\n\n\"Users of solar energy technology in Botswana should be working closely with manufacturers of the technology in China,\" said Moagi, adding that he learnt a lot from the ISA meeting which brought together African energy ministers to discuss ways of bringing long-term solutions to energy shortages in Africa using solar energy resources.\n\nSolar panels at Botswana's first Photovoltaic solar power plant which was commissioned in Gaborone, capital of Botswana, Aug. 27, 2012. (Xinhua/Sharon Tshipa)\n\nBotswana generates its electricity from coal and it is doing everything within its power to move toward increasing the share of renewable energies.\n\nMoagi said the country's power utility Botswana Power Corporation (BPC) recently rolled out two solar projects with different private players - a 3MW in the northeastern Botswana and a 1MW in the northwestern village of Shakawe - for them to generate and feed into national grid.\n\nGabaake Gabaake, an executive director at Tlou Energy Limited, an independent provider of clean energy in Botswana, told Xinhua on Friday in a separate interview that making use of Chinese technology and manpower to develop renewable energy resources would spur Botswana's transition from carbon emissions.\n\n\"We need private sector that will focus on manufacturing solar pumps and other productive use applications. And the Chinese are the only with the expertise,\" said Gabaake, saying Botswana can make strides through a linkage between her and China.\n\nIn partnership with some private players, President Mokgweetsi Masisi recently announced that Botswana is planning to build a solar power plant that will produce 25 gigawatts of electricity.\n\nLate last year, Masisi also pronounced that Botswana is aiming to deliver small-scale digester plants to reduce greenhouse emissions by 1.65 million tonnes of carbon dioxide by next year in order to attain reduction of national carbon emissions to 15 percent by 2030. ■",

Dr. Mark Chappell, U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) senior research physical scientist, participated traveled to Botswana with a team to assess opportunities for supporting water management and water security in the country’s Okavango Delta Region. (Photo courtesy of Anand Varma/ National Geographic see less | View Image Page\n\nVICKSBURG, Miss. – According to Greenpeace Africa, the Okavango Delta in Botswana is home to some of the world’s most endangered species of large mammals, such as the cheetah, white rhinoceros, black rhinoceros, African wild dog and lion. It is also home to huge populations of elephants and hippos.\n\n\n\nA U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) senior research physical scientist recently traveled to Botswana as part of a team to assess opportunities to support water management and water security in the country’s Okavango Delta Region.\n\n\n\nERDC’s Dr. Mark Chappell was joined by subject-matter experts from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) North Atlantic Division and Institute of Water Resources, as well as a delegation from the U.S. Department of State, U.S. Department of Defense and U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\n\n\nBackground\n\n\n\nThe Okavango Delta is fed by the Cubango and Cuito Rivers that originate in Angola, merge and briefly flow through Namibia, before ending in the Okavango Delta in Botswana. The river system is unique, because the water that reaches the delta does not empty into the ocean or another body of water — it dead ends into the Kalahari Desert and simply evaporates.\n\n\n\n“The Okavango Delta Region is very important to Botswana because it is a major source of international tourism,” Chappell said. “The region is a United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Site, and the abundance of wildlife makes the region a destination for non-hunting safaris.”\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the Okavango Delta is the main source of water for local communities in the region. However, Botswana has no control over the headwaters from the rivers; those are controlled by Angola and Namibia, which have varying levels of cooperation with Botswana.\n\n\n\nThe Okavango Delta region and the dynamics of the water system are threatened by two factors. First, the region is threatened by climate change pressures. Climate change is directly impacting the amount of water delivered to the delta, which impacts how the wildlife is distributed and the amount of wildlife the delta can support.\n\n\n\nThe second factor threatening the Okavango Delta is that Angola and Namibia are working to develop their own economies. Part of this development is bleeding water from the river system before it gets into the delta in Botswana.\n\n\n\nThe Biden-Harris Administration recently announced a White House Action Plan on Global Water Security, recognizing that water insecurity is a growing challenge in every region of the world and that each community faces its own local challenges. The U.S. is taking a “whole-of-government” approach to create a more water-secure world where people and nations have the water they need to be healthy, prosperous and resilient.\n\n\n\nIn June 2022, through a request from the U.S. Department of State, Chappell and the team travelled to meet with Botswana’s Ministries of Environment & Tourism and Agriculture, the Botswana Defense Force Research and Development team, the Okavango River Basin Commission and various other academic and non-governmental organizations.\n\n\n\n“The overall mission was to begin a dialogue with the Botswanans to give them some scientific capabilities and tools, specifically USACE and ERDC expertise, to aid them in their interactions with Angola and Namibia as it related to preserving the Okavango Delta region,” said Chappell.\n\n\n\nStakeholders expressed interest in USACE's ability to facilitate bringing people and organizations together, promoting diverse perspectives to policymakers and raising risk awareness and understanding in support of decision making.\n\n\n\nThe ERDC Role\n\n\n\nChappell leads the ERDC Environmental Laboratory’s Soil and Sediment Geochemistry team, which participates in global soil sampling. As a soil scientist, Chappell’s specific mission was to focus on ERDC capabilities that could benefit Botswana in terms of soil and environmental security.\n\nStakeholders were interested in opportunities to support basic and applied research, as well as development in water resources and soils-related technical services, geospatial information systems and disaster preparedness.\n\n\n\n“One thing we discovered— and it is a problem we find throughout the world— is that the United Nations did an extensive soil survey of the entire country in the 1970s and 1980s, but the surveys were never published,” Chappell said. “Unfortunately, no one in the Botswanan government has access to these surveys.”\n\n\n\nThe first goal for Chappell and ERDC is to digitize the old soil surveys to make them accessible to the Botswanan government, as they would greatly benefit the country.\n\n\n\nBotswana is an agrarian society; however, agricultural yields are below average, creating vast food insecurities in a country that is defined as medium-income. This is due, in part, to the people not knowing the specifics of the soil they are working with.\n\n\n\n“ERDC has been developing a lot of technology related to predicting a soil’s taxonomy — very detailed information about a soil and how it develops,” Chappell said. “This information can tell us a great deal about an area, but we have hardly any of this type of information for parts of the world other than the U.S.”\n\n\n\nMoving forward, ERDC will look at the soil surveys and digitize and publish the information. Chappell, working with the Botswana Defense Force Research and Development team, will examine what kind of soil Botswana has and focus on gaps in the information. Once those areas are identified, ERDC will assist in developing a program to fill them.\n\n\n\n“The ultimate goal for the State Department is to help the Botswanans develop programs that will allow them to solve their problems,” said Chappell. “Once these programs are developed, we want to transfer knowledge, and some technology, that will give the Botswanan government the power to make good decisions.”",
    "Botswana to Cull More Than 10,000 Cattle to Fight Disease Outbreak": "Botswana has announced it will cull more than 10,000 cattle in the country's northeast in a bid to fight an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. One of Africa's largest beef producers, Botswana was forced in August to halt beef exports over the virus, including to the lucrative European Union.\n\nAssistant Minister for Agriculture Molebatsi Molebatsi said the decision to kill affected livestock was taken following consultations with disease control experts.\n\n\"The decision to depopulate is the one we have taken,\" Molebatsi said. \"We took the decision after consultation with experts. We don't want any traces of the virus to remain or to have any further viral circulation.\"\n\nMolebatsi said 19,000 cattle are in the affected zone, which is near the Zimbabwe border, and more than 10,000 will be slaughtered. Some goats and sheep will also be culled.\n\nVeterinarian Mbatshi Mazwinduma said culling means farmers must be compensated.\n\n\"It comes at a great cost because it means people have to be compensated,\" Mazwinduma said. \"And there is also environmental issues of animals that have been slaughtered ... on how do you dispose of them safely.\"\n\nMazwinduma said in disease control, there should be certain considerations, particularly for the affected farmers.\n\n\"When you are trying to control the disease, you have to consider the economic, social and often political impact. Politically speaking, remember at times you are going to be slaughtering animals that belong to farmers, and you might push them further into abject poverty,\" Mazwinduma said. \"Most of the time, the compensation of animals that are slaughtered is nowhere near the equivalent value if they were to sell them at the market.\"\n\nBose Sethupa, a farmer from the affected region, said while the livelihoods of many people will be affected, the government has to contain the disease.\n\n\"It is a good move to try and contain the spread of the disease, but at the same time, it is not too good to the farmers because the government compensation is lower than the value of what the farmer will be having,\" Sethupa said. \"But apart from that ... the move is good. It is truly meant to protect the export market, which is very key to our economy.\"\n\nRoughly half of Botswana's beef exports — or about 9,000 tons — are sent to the EU each year.\n\n",

    "Botswana Seeks to Reduce Its Reliance on Diamonds": "On Thursday, Botswana should diversify its economy to reduce its heavy dependence on diamonds, President Mokgweetsi Masisi told world leaders attending the general debate of the 77th session of the UN General Assembly.\n\nBotswana is facing \"an uphill battle\" to attract investors to diversify its economy away from dependence on diamonds, the president said, while pointing out the resource is still the \"bedrock\" of its economy.\n\nWhen Botswana achieved independence 56 years ago, it was among the world's poorest countries, but now it is an upper-middle-income country, Masisi noted, adding it was fortunate to discover \"what has turned out to be the largest diamond reserve across the Kimberley Belt.\"\n\nThe president stressed that Botswana's recovery plan includes strengthening its protection system to ensure the inclusion of vulnerable groups and persons living with disabilities.\n\nPresident Mnagagwa and his Botswana counterpart President Masisi examine a diamond gem, during the Governance of Natural Resources: Diamonds for Development Conference, in New York, United States.

    "Things to know before going to Botswana": "Having driven alone around Botswana and across most of southern Africa, I've learned a few things from traveling as a female. The most important lesson? It's not as scary as you think.\n\nFrom Botswana’s arid south to the Okavango Delta at its heart and the bountiful Chobe region beyond, this peaceful country is a joy to explore. Here are the top things to know before you visit Botswana.\n\nGet local insight on destinations all over the world with our weekly newsletter delivered to your inbox.\n\nTo really explore Botswana's wilderness, you need a 4WD © Cavan Images / Getty Images\n\nGetting around is a challenge, and you'll probably need a 4WD vehicle\n\nIt’s possible to plan a sedan-friendly road trip on paved roads, but Botswana is known for its allure of remote wilderness rather than big city appeal. If you’re traveling independently and national parks are on your bucket list, you need a 4WD vehicle and must understand seasonal road conditions.\n\nA fully equipped 4WD car is typically rigged with rooftop tents. This means you can sleep higher up away from dangerous animals, and it comes with all the necessary camping gear for a self-sufficient adventure. These rugged vehicles can be picked up in Maun, Kasane or Johannesburg (South Africa) and rented from companies such as Bushtrackers Africa. They generally cost US$140 per day.\n\nAsk the rental company about the best times to visit specific areas (the answer will often be in the dry season) and to explain their emergency protocols and recovery support. For example, do they have an office and spare parts in Maun?\n\nDriving through Botswana's national parks and game reserves is not to be underestimated. As a rule, it's safest to travel with a satellite phone in case of a breakdown or with at least one other vehicle.\n\nThe backroads aren't in a good condition…\n\n…and neither are some of the main highways. Whether paved or not, don't be fooled by short distances. Plan extra time into your itinerary to account for slow-going road conditions – potholes, rutted roads and deep sand – and breathing room to stop and snap more photographs. Refer to Tracks4Africa, download the Maps.Me app or buy a paper map. This is the most accurate way to judge time over a given distance for Botswana's best off-road routes.\n\nSpots at campsites are limited, so book ahead of travel © jacobeukman / Getty Images\n\nBook campsites in advance during the peak season\n\nJuly and August are the busiest months in Botswana, and campsites fill up with intrepid travelers from overseas, plus safari-loving South Africans enjoying a winter bush break. Campgrounds inside the national parks are limited and run by different private operators. Call directly to book and start planning well in advance. Typically, response times over email are prolonged.\n\nPrint out proof of booking before your journey and draw cash in the local currency (pula) to pay the park fees. Expect to be turned away at the park's gate if there is no space, and it's invariably a distant trip back to the nearest town.\n\nSolo supplements are often waived outside peak season\n\nThe cheapest time to visit Botswana is between November and February, and you can still spot wildlife at these times. The landscape is lush, green, dramatic with epic cloud formations, and brimming with marvelously colorful birds, blooms and butterflies. However, this “green season” can also be the trickiest period to self-drive because the national parks and campsites have more mud and water, making some tracks impassable.\n\nInstead, this season is a superb time to fly into a high-end lodge. Many companies waive the single supplement fee for solo travelers. Despite being a solo traveler, you’ll find plenty of company. Dinner is frequently enjoyed around a communal table to compare sightings with other guests and learn more about life in Botswana from local camp managers or your guide. Another plus? More daylight hours to enjoy it all.\n\nPlan how long you should spend in Botswana\n\nWith a week or less, maximize your time by flying into a lodge or camp to explore. Spending three nights in one place will best compensate for the travel times (and airport waits) between locations.\n\nDiscover Botswana on a road trip if you have 10 days or more. The journey will feel rushed if you try to cram in all the wildlife hot spots, especially with the added toils of camping every day. Two weeks is a more reasonable duration to soak up the gorgeous diversity of the Delta and the desert, plus an overnight sightseeing stop at Victoria Falls.\n\nYou can't hop into a mokoro at any time of the year\n\nWater levels are generally at their highest in the Okavango Delta during July and August. Ask about the seasonality of gliding in a mokoro (traditional canoe) and time your trip to guarantee an outing on the water. For a fun weekend and more traditional insight into the importance of the mokoro, tie your trip with a visit to the annual Nkashi Classic festival.\n\nYou don't have to wear khaki on safari\n\nAny neutral-toned clothing will do as long as it's comfortable and lightweight and your shirt isn't too brightly colored. It's essential to layer up because Botswana experiences chilly mornings and evenings. In winter, temperatures can drop below freezing in desert areas. The only time beige and blending in is genuinely preferred is during a walking safari.\n\nWildlife sightings might be distant, so bring binoculars © Mint Images / Getty Images\n\nPack a pa ir of binoculars\n\nUnless on safari in a private reserve where guides can off-road into the bush for a sighting, you'll probably witness wildlife from a distance. Bring a good pair of general-purpose binoculars (specifications 8x40 or 10x42) and a decent zoom camera lens.\n\nGreet people in Setswana\n\nThe Batswana emphasize extensive greetings. Before asking for help, salutations go a long way and it’s respectful to greet everyone present, starting with the elders. If you are addressing a woman, say “Dumela, Mma” and “Dumela, Rra” to a man. For a group of people, a simple “Dumelang” will do. Asking how a person is doing and whether they slept well will score even more points.\n\nDress respectfully in rural areas\n\nWhile most tourist haunts adhere to Western dressing norms, this isn't the case everywhere, particularly in more rural locations. Women in Botswana typically dress modestly and wear skirts that cover the knees. It's best to follow this custom when visiting an office, police station or government building and when meeting distinguished members of society, such as the chief.\n\nDon't drive at night\n\nObstinate donkeys, roaming elephants, goats, wayward cattle and ostriches are just some of the wildlife that walk the roads of Botswana. Drive with extreme caution and avoid driving at night.\n\nYour shoes might carry disease\n\nBeef is a valuable export and cows a treasured signifier of cultural wealth in Botswana. Veterinary fences have been erected to separate domestic beasts from wild animals (admittedly, not always effectively) to prevent the spread of disease, specifically foot-and-mouth. Farmers, families and industry face financial catastrophe if cattle succumb to this infectious sickness.\n\nIt’s illegal to transport raw animal products or select fruits and vegetables from wilderness areas (mainly in the north) to rural areas (mostly in the south). Always stop at the official fence boundaries and road gates, even if they appear abandoned. Sometimes, an official sitting in the shade nearby will wave you through, but every vehicle is subject to inspection.\n\nReady the cooler boxes and make fridges accessible for checks. You'll also need to disinfect your shoes and stamp them in a sanitizing station to stop the potential spread. Keep all shoes aside or in crates to prevent the disinfectant from covering other gear.\n\nYou can drink the tap water in Botswana, but...\n\nTap water in towns is usually fine but probably not what you're used to, which can cause stomach upsets. The tap water is filtered at all tourist lodges. Meanwhile, many campsites do not have water at all, but grocery stores stock big bottles for overlanders.\n\nBring insect repellent and use it for a peaceful sleep\n\nMalaria is present in Botswana and widespread in the north. Consult your doctor about the latest anti-malaria precautions and use insect repellent liberally. Most lodgings supply an insect repellent called Peaceful Sleep, which locals use to keep unwanted buzzing and biting at bay.\n\nWatch out for petty theft\n\nAlthough crime is rare in Botswana, petty theft and sometimes pickpocketing occur in the cities. Like most places in the world, be vigilant with your valuables and avoid walking alone at night or in poorly lit areas.\n\nThere has also been a spate of midnight thefts at campsites near safari pit stops, such as Maun and Gweta. Thieves typically smash the windows of a car to snatch valuables. Do not leave your passport, camera, wallet or phone within reach.\n\nBotswana is a conservative country\n\nWomen traveling alone can expect to be asked if you have a husband or boyfriend. It's still not common to see independent travelers, and a band on your wedding finger can deter unwanted advances. It's even less common to see same-sex relationships. Homosexuality was decriminalized only in 2019, but it is still stigmatized, and public displays of affection could attract negative attention.\n\nLeave a tip\n\nIt's customary to tip lodge staff and safari guides, providing the service was good. Travel agents advise roughly US$15 per guest per day directly to the guide and $10 for the rest of the staff, which usually goes into a collective kitty. The US dollar is widely accepted at lodges and hotels throughout the country.",
    "African Domestic Bond Fund lists on Botswana Stock Exchange": "The African Domestic Bond Fund (ADBF), an exchange-traded fund, has been listed in the local Pula currency on the Botswana Stock Exchange (BSE). The listing, on 15 September 2022, follows the Fund’s primary US dollar listing on the Mauritius Stock Exchange in 2018. The Pula-denominated listing will offer investors an innovative tool to gain exposure to African local currency fixed income.\n\nADBF is the first multinational fixed income exchange-traded fund in Africa. It was launched by the African Development Bank as part of initiatives to strengthen African economies by reducing their dependency on foreign-currency-denominated debt, increasing the range of available financing options, and acting as a catalyst for regional market integration.\n\nThe Fund replicates the African Development Bank Bloomberg African Bond Indices (ABABI), a family of bond indices that tracks 10 countries and represents roughly 90% of the total stock of outstanding African local-currency bonds.\n\nABABI, administered by the Bank and calculated by Bloomberg, was developed to improve liquidity in local capital markets and serve as a benchmark for investors in African local currency. The indices also provide a strategic tool to improve the market infrastructure of the African bond markets.\n\nStefan Nalletamby, Director of the African Development Bank’s Financial Sector Development Department, said: “This listing on the BSE is a very positive development as the local asset status of the Fund will enable Botswana’s institutional investors to invest in the Fund as part of their domestic allocations. This listing aligns with our mandate to develop capital markets products across our Regional Member Countries.”\n\nThe African Domestic Bond Fund provides compelling opportunities from both an investment and development point of view, said Ahmed Attout, Manager of the Bank’s Capital Markets Development Division. He said the African Development Bank had not only conceptualized the Fund but is also investing up to $25 million in it as a sign of commitment to the initiative.\n\nThe Africa Development Bank works to deepen Africa’s local currency bond markets and create an environment where African countries can access long-term financing.",

    "Jimny Botswana Expedition; arriving in Botswana – Part 1": "Suzuki\n\nJimny\n\nLooking to experience some of our environment’s finest treasures and yearning to see the animal kingdom free to roam as nature intended? This Botswana experience is just across our border and you don’t need a modified vehicle to get there. CAR Magazine editor Damian Adams joined the Suzuki #BigInBotswana Jimny safari.\n\nDay 1: Arriving at Kasane Airport, Botswana\n\nAs we flew over the magnificent Chobe National Park before touching down at Kasane Airport, there were audible gasps and struggles to contain our astonishment as we witnessed a tower of Giraffes quenching their thirst at a watering hole. We watched in wonder as these lanky animals moved about and could not believe that we hadn’t even arrived yet and we could already check that sighting off on our mental checklists. We were warmly welcomed by our guides, JJ du Toit and Hein, and the rest of the team when we touched down, and after being briefed we very excitedly, and hurriedly might I add, chose the Jimny that we’d had our eyes on the minute we walked out of the Airport into the blazing hot Botswana sun.\n\nRelated: Suzuki adds mid-spec Jimny GL and Rhino Edition Kit to lineup\n\nWe chose the Kinetic Yellow Jimny, and in hindsight we were probably the ones who chased some of the wildlife away because we certainly did not blend in with the natural environment. The funky little Jimny was packed to the brim with everything that made for a memorable #BigInBotswana trip: this ranged from well-catered snacks & drinks, a Shell Tourist Map of Botswana, a Photographic checklist booklet and an array of equipment to aid the off-roading experience. Needless to say, when we saw the “shewee device”, a handy female urine funnel that allows women to urinate easily while standing or sitting down comfortably when there’s no toilet around, we knew exactly what we’d be in for.\n\nThe adventure in our Jimny began immediately as it showed off its comfort and capability on tar first en route to an engineering wonder that is the Kazungula bridge which joins Namibia, Botswana, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The local residents were in awe of our convoy and, true to form of a Jimny owner, the smiles, waving and general camaraderie were present during our drive through the town. Within the first 15 minutes of being in Botswana, we got to see Kudu, Impala and Giraffe and we hadn’t even spotted an ordinary domestic dog yet. When we thought that this was the best it would get, we entered the Chobe National Park for a 140 km drive to our destination for that night and immediately spotted a lone Elephant who had been kicked out of his herd and appeared to be in search of a Bachelor herd to begin his life as an independent Ellie.\n\nWe arrived at the breath-taking Mwandi View Lodge where we were greeted warmly and got to enjoy some much-needed sundowners after an exciting first day. We also got to take in some incredible sights, as well as the reality of this being the first and last night of luxury accommodation which included electricity, WIFI and standard ablution facilities. The thought of this was both nerve-wracking and exciting. We slept well that night and resigned ourselves to being one with nature as the sounds of wild life and the honking of Hippos were our lullabies.\n\nFAST FACTS\n\nModel: Suzuki Jimny 1,5 GL AllGrip\n\nPrice: R343 900\n\nEngine: 1,5-litre, four-cylinder petrol\n\nTransmission: 5-speed, manual\n\nPower: 77 kW @ 6 000 r/min\n\nTorque: 130 N.m @ 4 000 r/min\n\nGround clearance: 210 mm\n\nFuel consumption: 6,3 L/100 km\n\nCO 2 emissions: 146 g/km\n\nIf you’d like to experience this for yourself, which we would highly recommend that you visit africaexpeditions.co.za.\n\nSuzuki\n\nJimny",
    "Namibia, Botswana have agreed to stop border killings – Kapofi": "DEFENCE minister Frans Kapofi said Namibia and Botswana have agreed to abolish instances of citizens of the two countries being killed by their defence forces.\n\nHe said the agreement was made when officials from the two countries held a meeting at Swakopmund last year.\n\nKapofi was speaking during a meeting with traditional leaders at Eenhana recently.\n\nHe said he informed traditional leaders in the Zambezi region about this.\n\n“We have heard of our people killed by the Botswana Defence Force while crossing into Botswana. We were discussing those aspects and I assured them that we are engaging our counterparts in Botswana. That aspect of people being killed should not be repeated,” Kapofi said.\n\nHe said the government has put policies in place for Namibians found within the borders or territory of Botswana, or Botswana nationals found poaching in Namibia.\n\nThose transgressing the law will be arrested, charged and taken to court, he said.\n\nKapofi said earlier this month, the Namibian chief of defence, air marshal Martin Pinehas engaged his counterpart in Botswana on issues relating to bilateral relations and cooperation between the two countries.\n\n“We decided when we met them at Swakopmund last year that we must put up structures that safeguard the safety of our people along our borders, and that the killing of our people, be it in Namibia or Botswana must stop forthwith,” he said.\n\nOver the past two decades, about 35 Namibians have been killed in Botswana anti-poaching operations, such as the three brothers Tommy Nchindo, Wamunyima Nchindo and Martin Nchindo and their Zambian cousin Sinvula Munyeme.\n\nThe four were killed in November 2020, along the Chobe River in the Zambezi region.\n\nAt the time, Botswana claimed they were part of a syndicate of poachers believed to be part of a network responsible for cross-border poaching. However, the Nchindo family denied those claims.\n\nNamibian Lives Matter representative Charles Siyauya yesterday told The Namibian despite Kapofi's pronouncement, there would likely be little action from the Namibian government.\n\n“It's an old song. There is no protection from the government of Namibia. God is the only protector of the lives of Namibians in the Zambezi region.\n\n“It is one of those unchecked political statements by honourable Kapofi, who is too arrogant, and lacks sympathy with the people he was supposed to protect from external threats posed by the government of Botswana, which is thirsty and is craving Namibian blood,” he said.\n\nILLEGAL FENCING IN ANGOLA\n\nKapofi also asked traditional leaders to inform residents grazing in Angola to stop fencing off grazing areas.\n\nHe said some Namibians have put up homesteads and declared themselves headmen in Angola, without the permission of the Angolan authorities.\n\n“Now people are angry,” Kapofi said.\n\nHe said all Namibian citizens grazing in Angola should be known, and they should not violate Angolan laws.\n\n“Angola is a friendly country but if we push them, they will just close the borders and if they close the borders, what do we do? Please, let's try and respect the sovereignty of that country,” Kapofi said.",
    "Botswana junior eyes profits as it sends coal via Namibia to voracious European markets": "After a rough few years, Botswana coal miner Minergy, hopes next year it will report a profit as it continues moves product through Namibia's Walvis Bay and into export markets.\n\n\n\nIn its results for the year ended in June, released on Tuesday, Minergy reported it had extracted and processed over a million metric tons of coal in a single financial year at its Masama mine near Gaborone. Close to 40% of that production was realised in the fourth quarter of the financial year as the company moved to take advantage of strong demand from export markets.\n\nMinergy's is the first coal to leave through the port of Walvis Bay – an exercise which is now economic, despite the vast travel distance, thanks to exceedingly strong export coal prices in the face of supply disruptions related to Russia's war on Ukraine.",
    "Whatever happened to the Botswana scientist who identified omicron — then caught it?": "Whatever happened to the Botswana scientist who identified omicron — then caught it?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Leabaneng Natasha Moyo Leabaneng Natasha Moyo\n\nSikhulile Moyo led the team of scientists that first identified the omicron variant of COVID-19 in November 2021. It's gone on to dominate the world. Moyo directs the laboratory for the Botswana–Harvard AIDS Institute and is a research associate with the Harvard School of Public Health.\n\nAbout This Series Over the next week, we'll be looking back at some of our favorite Goats and Soda stories to see \"whatever happened to ...\"\n\nMoyo was disturbed to see the world's reaction to the more transmissible variant. Other nations closed off travel and trade with southern African countries, including Botswana, even as they discovered the variant was already within their own borders. In fact, it was subsequently found that the variant was circulating in the Netherlands a week before the announcement from Africa.\n\n\"How do you reward the countries that alert you of a potential dangerous pathogen with travel bans? My country was put on a red list, and I didn't feel good about that,\" Moyo told NPR.\n\nNPR touched base with Moyo to see what he's been working on – and thinking about – since this landmark discovery.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nYou discovered omicron. Did omicron discover you?\n\nI got COVID. Funnily enough, the omicron discoverer gets omicron.\n\nI had three days of very serious symptoms of COVID, and I had to stay at home. So I would say mild to severe, but not too severe.\n\nThen I had long COVID. I had almost three months of difficulty trying to recover my lung volume, my breathing. Walking, I was fatigued. All of a sudden, the COVID made my [blood] sugar worse, and I had to change my diabetes doses. I had to step up my meds, because it was no longer controlling [my diabetes] the way it was.\n\nThese are the complications that come with COVID, while people think COVID is gone.\n\nDo you think the world has made any progress in learning not to cast blame?\n\nThere was a global awakening. Those events around the omicron discovery showed us the triumph of science but the failure of global health policy.\n\nWhile we suffered, we were a catalyst to make people aware of the value of global public health — that we cannot be inward-looking, because the virus knows no borders.\n\nYou see the response to monkeypox is different than the response to COVID. No one is blacklisting anyone from the monkeypox-endemic areas.\n\nHas your work changed because of this discovery — are you and your lab collaborating more with scientists around the world?\n\nYes! We have established collaborations with the Africa CDC. We've established what is called the Pathogen Genomics Initiative, a network of labs that are working together, and we have a lot of demand for training.\n\nI was named one of the TIME magazine's 100 most influential people of 2022. That gives us a voice to share our experiences but also access to a lot of collaborations that I never thought I would have. That is really pushing us forward.\n\nHave you made more ground-breaking omicron discoveries?\n\nEarlier this year, around April, May, there was the discovery of BA.4 and BA.5, and we detected them in Botswana a few days after South Africa detected them. And these are the variants that have taken over the world. Some of the questions have been: What's happening in southern Africa that [the region] is seemingly detecting more variants?\n\nWhat is unique about southern Africa, especially Botswana and South Africa, is the ability to detect these variants in near real-time because of the pathogen genomic sequencing that has been established [examining DNA to identify it or see if it's changing]. We think it's not that they are not circulating elsewhere, but it's just that maybe we are looking deeper.\n\nWe are always doing pathogen genomic sequencing. The most resourced in the world, in terms of sequencing, is of course the U.K. and the United States, and many parts of Europe. But I think the systematic, real-time, sampling and sequencing [in southern Africa] has been very, very useful.\n\nHow has southern Africa become so good at finding new variants and subvariants?\n\nSouthern Africa was the hotspot for HIV. We have passed through difficult times. I think we have taken this to our advantage to find solutions for ourselves. With funding — from PEPFAR and from other international agencies, U.S. institutes, some donors — southern Africa began to implement pathogen genomics focusing on HIV.\n\nSome of us were involved in setting up population-based sequencing to understand the movement of viruses, to characterize transmission dynamics — and that has spilled out to malaria, to TB. And we used those technologies to quickly adapt to SARS-CoV-2. That has been the strength of southern Africa.\n\nWe're even thinking beyond COVID. We are preparing ourselves to be able to adapt for pathogen discovery. If a [new] outbreak happens, we should be able to quickly check within 24 to 36 hours what it is.\n\nNew subvariants seem to be getting better at reinfecting people. What does that mean moving forward?\n\nBA.4 and BA.5 are masters in terms of evading the fury of the immune system. The subvariants were able to elicit an immune response, but magnitudes lower than what we saw before.\n\nAs the immunity wanes down, that's where my worry is: How far can we hold on with the current levels of immunity?\n\nThe vaccine immunity still provides some protection against severe disease. We know that you may get infected, but you may not get hospitalized with BA.4 and BA.5.\n\nIt may get a little bit rough. Many people are spending days at home and [developing] long COVID afterward.\n\nWhat do you think needs to happen next?\n\nResearch, training and development cost a lot of money, but as cases go down, people forget that we need to make sure these systems are sustained. That's one of the challenges: Are we going to be able to sustain some of this innovation that we have developed over a very difficult time of our lives during COVID?\n\nThe virus is still finding some pathways to escape immune pressure.\n\nAnd there's always a possibility of a more virulent variant?\n\nThe variant that is going to really dominate is a variant that would have a massive escape to antibody neutralization or to vaccine neutralization. Chances are low of that happening. But omicron taught us that anything can happen.\n\nSo we need to be very careful. We need to continue with surveillance, so that if we notice anything, we should be able to go back and say: Do we need to change the way we are doing things?\n\nWhile I support loosening and going back to our lives [when cases are low], I also feel that's when you need to be more vigilant. When you see signs of wildfire starting, then you can try and put it out.\n\nMelody Schreiber (@m_scribe) is a journalist and the editor of What We Didn't Expect: Personal Stories About Premature Birth.",

    "Epidemiological and viral characteristics of undiagnosed HIV infections in Botswana - BMC Infectious Diseases": "Among a large representative population of adults with HIV in rural/peri-urban Botswana, we compared the demographic and behavioural characteristics of those with known, diagnosed HIV-infection compared with those newly diagnosed with HIV at the start of a clinical trial. Participants with undiagnosed HIV infections were more likely to be male, young, and not to consistently use condoms. Among women, being married, educated and testing frequently increased the risk of an undiagnosed HIV infection. For men, there was a wider range of ages among undiagnosed HIV cases and being divorced increased risk.\n\nViral genetic sequences are informative regarding stage of HIV infection because individuals are usually infected with a single virus and genetic diversity then increases with time [20,21,22]. Results from the genetic diversity-based classifier were concordant with epidemiological data: most known cases were classified as chronic (97.9%) while most incident cases were classified as recent (75.0%). This means that 25% of incident infections were misclassified as chronic, a high false negative rate due to a high proportion of participants being on ART [39]. Based on the classifier, over a third (37.0%) of newly diagnosed cases were recently infected. Given the high false negative rate of the classifier this proportion may be an underestimate—therefore a sizeable proportion of newly diagnosed cases were likely to be recent infections. Another genetic signature of time between infection and diagnosis is the length of the terminal branch leading to a sequence [22, 40, 41]. Short terminal branch lengths indicate that sampling occurred shortly after the last transmission event. However, we found no consistent differences in the distribution of terminal branch lengths among our three groups. This lack of signal may be due to the low sample proportion of our population as a whole (12,610 of a total trial area population of 175,664, 7.2%): the relationship between terminal branch length and time to diagnosis will be disrupted if too many transmissions are missed in the phylogeny [42]. The relationship between time to diagnosis and terminal branch length has been demonstrated in simulations [41] but its utility in the real world will have to be further ascertained in datasets with higher sampling proportions. One study that successfully used root to tip branch length in determining time since infection demonstrated its use for estimating HIV incidence at a population level [43].\n\nIn our study, more women (63.8%) were enrolled than men (36.2%). A similar study in Zambia and South Africa (HPTN-071) showed similar enrolment patterns for women (70%) and men (30%) [44]. Surveys across sub-Saharan Africa have consistently demonstrated that HIV testing uptake is higher among women than among men [2, 13, 45]. One reason women are more likely to know their HIV status is that most countries, including Botswana, screen for HIV during pregnancy as part of prevention of mother to child transmission [3, 46, 47]. This strategy may explain why in our study, women with more children were less likely to have undiagnosed HIV infections. Furthermore, fewer undiagnosed infections were observed as participants increased in age, in agreement with others [2, 13, 19, 45], and testing increased with age. HIV testing rates among men below 25 years are low [17]. In Botswana, people above 50 living with HIV are more likely to be aware of their HIV status and to be on antiretroviral therapy [36]. Older women in particular are more likely to be aware of their positive HIV status than older men [48], and concordantly, in our study the effect of age was much stronger in women than in men. Men up to age 44 had an increased risk for an undiagnosed infection, while this was only true for women up to age 24.\n\nOur data shows that being married increased the risk of an undiagnosed HIV infection for women. The association between marriage and undiagnosed HIV infection has been noted previously [10, 11, 49]. In contrast, a survey conducted in South Africa showed that married people living with their spouses were less likely to be HIV positive [50], but even in that study, HIV infections were highest among those who were married but who spent extended periods away from home. Knowing one’s partner to be HIV-positive decreased the odds of an undiagnosed HIV infection. This finding could indicate that sero-discordant couples take precautions to prevent transmission and to get diagnosed rapidly but it seems reasonable to assume that this is most likely due to demonstrate the success of treatment as prevention. In our study, we found that those women with a higher education were more likely to have undiagnosed HIV infections, despite education improving HIV testing behaviours [10, 46, 49]. Previous cross-sectional analyses have demonstrated a positive association between educational attainment and HIV positivity across sub-Saharan African countries [51]; educational attainment may increase the likelihood of sexual opportunities or risk-taking.\n\nThe behavioural factors associated with undiagnosed HIV were repeated HIV testing (for women) and inconsistent condom use (for both sexes). At first glance, this first finding seems contradictory: frequent testing increases the chances of diagnosing HIV within the early stages of infection and should decrease the probability that a person has an undiagnosed HIV infection. Most participants (72.8% of known, previously diagnosed cases and 44.6% newly diagnosed cases) were tested for the first-time at enrolment or had tested only once previously. It is possible that women who test frequently do so because they are aware of being at risk for HIV. For example, they may use HIV testing as a greenlight for unprotected sex, or they may get tested following a risk event. However, higher numbers of partners and concurrency were not identified among these women. They may have risk behaviours that they did not disclose within this study. Further research is required to make specific recommendations regarding optimal HIV testing timings and frequency for this group, who already test regularly. We note that once a person tests HIV positive, they will not continue to get tests. Therefore, there is some censoring in our data on number of tests, however this censoring should not bias our interpretation. Health seeking behaviours such as frequent HIV testing and safe sexual practices by using a condom reduce HIV transmission [12]. Consistent condom use offered protection against HIV infection and participants who never used condoms were 4 times more likely to have undiagnosed HIV than those who always did.\n\nOur analysis was subject to several limitations. First, the BCPP study enrolled only 20% of households in target areas. While this proportion is high for a single study, it is low when compared to HIV testing and sequencing coverage in countries such as the UK. A similar study, PopART, conducted in Zambia and South Africa sampled 4.8% of their population (48,301/100,000) [44] while BCPP reached 7.2% (12,610/175,664). It may be due to this low sampling proportion that we were not able to see differences in terminal branch lengths, because too many transmissions were missed in the phylogeny. Lastly, although the BCPP questionnaires were thorough, many answers were not complete. Our analyses were affected by missing data in some variables of interest ranging from 1–40%. Our analysis yielded significant results, but if some information was deliberately obscured, we may be missing important associations. Further studies are warranted to further investigate these variables with complete datasets.",

Botswana coach Gaolethoo Nkutlwisang said that the team would go all out to win the COSAFA championship, in which they finished runners-up in 2020.\n\nThe only two players remaining from Botswana's WAFCON squad are goalkeeper Lesego Moeng and attacking midfielder Keitumetse Dithebe, who enjoyed a good tournament with two goals.\n\nPrior to the team's departure on Tuesday, Nkutlwisang said that she had chosen the squad to give young players opportunities to gain international experience, adding that her charges are hungry to fight for positions in the team.\n\nBotswana will kick off their opening Group C match against Malawi on Friday.\n\nBotswana's WAFCON debut saw them finish third in Group B, behind eventual champions South Africa and defending champions Nigeria.

    "Botswana gets first fuel price fall in 2022": "Gaborone: Botswana witnessed its first-ever drop in fuel prices in 2022, said the country’s energy authorities.\n\nAccording to a press release from Botswana Energy Regulatory Authority, pump prices for petrol, diesel and illuminating paraffin will decrease by 1 pula ($0.076), 0.23 pula and 0.08 pula per liter, respectively, Xinhua news agency reported.\n\nThe authority said the decrease was necessitated by the fall in oil prices over the past two months. Brent Crude averaged $97.74 per barrel in August compared to an average of $105.12 a barrel in July.\n\nThe energy authority said the fall in fuel prices was influenced mainly by fears of a possible global recession, which could weaken the global demand for oil.\n\nFour straight increases in fuel prices in the Southern African country since December 2021 have primarily contributed to rising inflation, which reached a 13-year high of 14.30 per cent in July.\n\n–IANS",
    "Botswana: Namibia Donates Land At Walvis Bay Port to Botswana": "THE Namibian government has donated a piece of land at the port of Walvis Bay to Botswana to construct a dry port facility and make that country sea-linked.\n\nThis was revealed by president Hage Geingob on Friday while delivering his speech at the inaugural session of the Botswana-Namibia bi-national commission in Gaborone, Botswana.\n\nGeingob said Namibia continues to make good progress in cross-border trade.\n\nHe added that the donation was not only a gesture of goodwill, but also meant to facilitate the import and export of goods and services.\n\n\"President [Mokgweetsi] Masisi informed me when we met in Rwanda that Botswana intended to increase its volumes of imports and exports through the port of Walvis Bay,\" Geingob said.\n\nThe president said this would mean Namibia and Botswana must jointly and speedily work together on expanding the transport infrastructure to accommodate increased trade volumes between the respective countries.\n\n\"Our ministers must prioritise, and include in our development plans, the upgrade and expansion of infrastructure to accommodate anticipated increase in trade volumes,\" he said.\n\nIn addition, Geingob said the two countries would sign a bilateral agreement for the establishment of a one-stop border post at the Mamuno-Trans-Kalahari border post.\n\n\"This will contribute to maximizing the operational efficiency of the Southern African Development Community transport development corridors, thereby contributing to our regional development and economic integration efforts,\" Geingob said.",
    "Cricket Cranes get off the mark with 7-Wicket win over Botswana": "Match Summary: Uganda v Botswana\n\nBotswana 103/8 20 overs\n\nUganda 107/3 18.2/20 overs\n\nUganda won by 7 wickets\n\nAlpesh Ramjani and Pascal Murungi were handed Cricket Cranes debut in the seven-wicket win over Botswana in the opening game of the T20 Africa Cup finals in South Africa.\n\nThe first edition of the Africa Cup has attracted 8 teams split into two groups with Uganda in Group A alongside Botswana, Mozambique, and Ghana.\n\nCaptain Brian Masaba called correct after winning the toss as he elected to bowl first. Ramjani made the most of this moment with a brilliant spell of left arm spin picking up 4/17 in his 4 overs. Masaba (1/9) and Cosmas Kyewuta (1/19) with a wicket a piece came in handy.\n\nIn the chase, Simon Ssesazi (37) and Riazat Ali Shah (36 not out) took care of the business despite Uganda dropping 3 wickets.\n\nIt was a great performance from the Cricket Cranes who are working without their regular T20 specialists Dinesh Nakrani, Ronak Patel, and Bilal Hassun which opened up a few slots for new players.\n\nFrank Nsubuga who surely opens the bowling was used sparingly to take care of the back end of things where Dinesh and Bilal usually operate while Brian Masaba had to open the batting with Simon Ssesazi in the absence of Ronak Patel.\n\nMurungi didn’t get a chance to showcase his skills due to little resources but a run out with the boys should get him in good stead. Kenneth Waiswa still struggling for runs but the team has kept faith in him which is a good thing for his confidence.\n\nUganda will take on Mozambique in their next game on Sunday morning.",

    "Namibia, Botswana Agri Bans Threaten South African Jobs": "The lack of action taken to have agricultural import bans imposed by Botswana - and more recently Namibia - lifted is creating a feeling among South African fresh produce farmers that the government has failed them.\n\nChristo van der Rheede, executive director of Agri SA, told Farmer's Weekly that these bans did not stem from any wrongdoing on the part of South African farmers but rather because these countries wanted to \"protect their own local production\" even as they continued to export their produce to South Africa.\n\nAs such, the trade bans were in direct violation of the Southern Africa Customs Union Agreement, aimed at facilitating free trade among countries in the region.\n\nClive Garrett, marketing manager at ZZ2, added that these countries already had a competitive advantage over South Africa due to their low labour costs.\n\nWhere the national minimum wage in South Africa was R23.19/hour, the minimum wage was R5.05/hour in Botswana and it averaged about R12.23/hour in Namibia, which did not have a minimum wage but made use of collective bargaining agreements to determine wages.\n\nIn addition, the majority of farmers in these countries did not have to submit their operations to audits by quality assurance organisations, such as Global GAP and the Sustainability Initiative of South Africa, to verify compliance with health, social and environmentally responsible production practices.\n\n\"Despite their competitive advantage, these countries have decided to close their borders to South African produce, but continue to export their produce to South Africa at the expense [of local producers]. At present, about 13% of the tomatoes [traded] on the South African fresh produce market are from Namibia,\" Garret said.\n\nDespite farmers complaining about the state of affairs to the departments of trade and industry and agriculture through Agri SA when these trade bans were introduced, the government had to date done nothing to resolve the issue, he said.\n\n\"Failure to protect our markets will not only affect foreign income and farmer revenues but also job security in South Africa,\" Garret said.\n\nWillie Jacobs, CEO of Potatoes South Africa, said the problem with Namibia was that the stipulations of these bans were being adjusted almost every week and were being communicated via the country's website.\n\nThis made it difficult for South African potato farmers to plan and adhere to their marketing programmes.\n\nClose Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox Top Headlines Namibia Business South Africa By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.

    "Botswana: Partners Host Inaugural Women's African Military Professional Legal Network Event in Botswana": "press release\n\nGabarone, Botswana — This inaugural event, held Aug. 6, 2022, was part of the larger sixth African Military Law Forum that took place Aug. 8-10, co-sponsored with the North Carolina National Guard and the Botswana Defence Force\n\nU.S. Africa Command's Office of Legal Counsel co-hosted the inaugural Women's African Military Professional Legal Network, along with the Botswana Defence Force, at the Grand Palm Convention Center in Gaborone, Botswana, on Aug. 6, 2022.\n\nThis inaugural event was part of the larger sixth African Military Law Forum that took place later in the week from Aug. 8-10, co-sponsored with the North Carolina National Guard and the BDF.\n\nThe WAMPLN event brought 60 female African military legal professionals from 16 African countries to discuss the importance of networking. Attendees represented a diverse audience, including the most experienced and senior level magistrates and legal advisors within their defense institutions, as well as a number of younger professionals. WAMPLN also served as a catalyst to consider attendees' professional experience and how that might represent Women, Peace and Security related themes.\n\nThe event was led by U.S. Africa Command's Associate Legal Counsel, Ms. Sandra Franzblau, and BDF Advisor, Maj. Matshediso Kau. Ms. Shannon Meehan served as the facilitator, using her experience as a trainer and consultant on gender considerations in conflict zones.\n\n\"It was momentous as for the first time, it brings together female legal advisors and magistrates, to learn from one another and network,\" Kau said.\n\n\"All of us within this room represent one of the four pillars of the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) framework: the integration of women into the security forces,\" Franzblau said. \"I recognize that there is a high likelihood that your professional experiences might cross into other areas of the WPS framework. What we do with this, what happens next for WAMPLN, will ultimately be decided by you. This event belongs to you.\"\n\nFranzblau, continuing on a theme that resonated with both the WAMPLN and the AMLF plenary session, further added that \"it is not up to a minority community to fix the issues of majority cultural bias and prejudice. While the experiences and perspectives of the minority should be guiding, the fix belongs to everyone.\"\n\nIn attendance were the AMLF Vice President, Maj. Berthe Tambe, and the AMLF Advisory Council Member, Col. Marguerite Meffand-Loaw, both of whom are magistrates of the Cameroon Armed Forces.\n\nMeffand-Loaw deployed for two years as a magistrate with the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO). She affirmed that she saw the disparate impact gender plays in armed conflict.\n\nThis view was seconded by U.S. Marine Corps Gunnery Sgt. Mildred Bowman, who is currently deployed as a gender advisor and human rights violations analyst at the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic, known as MINUSCA.\n\nFollowing the introductions of all 60 participants, Meehan led discussion groups to first introduce the WPS agenda. She underscored a series of ten United Nation Security Council Resolutions, starting in 2000 with UNSCR 1325, that link women's experiences of conflict to the maintenance of peace and security. Together, they form an international legal and policy framework emphasizing the necessity for: women to fully and meaningfully participate at all levels of decision making, to include within the security sector; women to participate in preventing the emergence and spread of violent conflict; women and girls in conflict to be protected, to include the reporting and prosecution of sexual and gender based violence; and women to have equal access to humanitarian and development assistance in all relief and recovery efforts.\n\nFurther, Meehan discussed that nations are to develop action plans, sometimes referred to as 1325 National Action Plans. As of today, approximately half of UN member states have National Action Plans.\n\nAttendees ultimately determined that WAMPLN should continue as a committee within AMLF. This committee would allow participants to maintain contact with one another, ensure WAMPLN serves as a forum where some of the challenges of gender integration could be discussed, and allow the AMLF to more formally consider gender in all future events, thereby operationalizing gender considerations.\n\nClose Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox Top Headlines Women U.S., Canada and Africa Botswana By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.

There was an out brief to the AMLF plenary session on Aug. 8, summarizing the decisions and recommendations that were made during the WAMPLN. Subsequently, elections were held for AMLF's next leaders and several WAMPLN attendees ran for various positions. Following the elections, AMLF's nine-member board went from two female representatives to six.\n\n\"Throughout the group discussions and questioning, there was a keen interest and enthusiasm to understand the priorities of Women, Peace and Security,\" Meehan said. \"They were ready to operationalize WPS not only within their day-to-day military legal duties, but also within all branches of the military.\"",
    "Botswana slowly transforming into electricity exporter": "IMPORTER TO EXPORTER This file photo shows Wada Kealotswe trimming a pencil using a pencil cutting machine bought from China in Gaborone, Botswana on March 6, 2022. Using a China-built power plant, Botswana, a net importer of electricity, was slowly becoming an electricity exporter. XINHUA PHOTO\n\nGABORONE: Botswana has been a net importer of electricity over the years. However, the coal-fired power station Morupule B — built by the China National Electric Engineering Corp. (CNEEC) — is slowly but surely changing Botswana's status quo, Prof. Edward Dintwe, dean of the faculty of Engineering and Technology at the University of Botswana, said in an interview with Xinhua.\n\nFor the past three months, both Morupule A and B power stations have been fully operational and dispatching over 800 megawatts (MW) of power per hour to the national grid, which is well above local electricity consumption, according to the Botswana Power Corp. (BPC).\n\n\"Sales have been made possible by improved plant availability at the flagship 600 megawatts Morupule B plant. So the surplus electricity should be sold to neighboring countries,\" Lefoko Moagi, Botswana's minister of Minerals and Energy, told Xinhua.\n\nAs A landlocked country, Botswana is dominated by coal-fired power generation and had only one power station Morupule A before 2010.\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times’ daily newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nTo ensure energy security and increase electricity self-sufficiency, Botswana started the 600-MW Morupule B power station project in 2010 with the CNEEC as the general contractor.\n\nZhang Xiangrong, CNEEC project manager, said with the joint efforts of the Botswana government and the company, the plant operation is stable currently. The company started the renovation project of the power station in 2019. At present, the first unit has been renovated, and the trial operation will be finished in September.\n\n\"Morupule B power plant is fully functioning with all the four units producing 150 megawatts of electricity each,\" said Moagi, adding that Morupule A power plant is generating at least 232 MW, thereby bringing Botswana's power generation to 832 MW per hour.\n\nMoagi said Botswana utilizes 580 MW during peak hours while only 360 MW are needed at off-peak hours. Botswana's peak and off-peak hours are during the evenings as well as mornings and in the afternoon and during weekends when industries are not open.\n\nMoagi said South Africa, whose public electricity utility in Eskom is facing generation problems, is willing to buy power from Botswana. The BPC has therefore started engaging Eskom to purchase the excess electricity supply generated during off-peak periods to protect plants against load management fluctuations and also ensure that surplus electricity has a secured market.\n\nSpeaking during a media briefing after the Botswana-South Africa Business Roundtable in Gaborone, capital of Botswana on Aug. 4, 2022, President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa said the willingness shown by Botswana to sell South Africa excess electricity will strengthen economic and trade ties.\n\nBy selling power to South Africa, Botswana hopes to realize its goal of becoming \"a regional benchmark in power delivery\" by 2026 with the Maduo26 strategy, a five-year plan unveiled last year.",

    "Brave Gladiators to play Botswana": "THE senior national women's football team, the Brave Gladiators, will take on Botswana next week in an international friendly match in Gaborone.\n\nSpeaking to Desert Radio yesterday, Namibia Football Association interim general secretary Jochen Traut confirmed the invitation by the Botswana Football Association to have the Brave Gladiators as part of their independence celebrations.\n\n“We are definitely sending our Gladiators to Botswana to take part in the independence celebration, on the invitation of the football association. They will leave on Tuesday next week and come back on Sunday.”\n\nTraut said any game is good for any team, especially for Namibia, as it provides exposure for the players and helps with Namibia's relationship going forward as Bona 2027.\n\nBrave Gladiators head coach Paulo Shipanga said it is an honour that Botswana invited Namibia, and not any other country, to their celebration.\n\n“We are humbled and have accepted the invitation for an international friendly, and we are truly pleased.”\n\nShipanga said despite it being an international friendly match, they intend to give Botswana a tough match.\n\nDuring this year's Cosafa women's cup in South Africa, the Brave Gladiators lost the third place play-offs against Tanzania, a feat welcomed by many in the absence of an active women's football league.\n\n“I am this time around going to take a young group of players because many of my players who played in the Cosafa women's cup have school commitments, while others are nursing injuries,” said Shipanga.\n\n“We started our preparation this week Monday. I am, however, waiting for a few players to join the training camp. I will take 23 players and will have the full team by the end of this week.”",
    "Exciting Botswana looks to ‘really play’ against Tanzania": "The first ball will be bowled at 2pm as Botswana chases a historic final berth. The Baggy Blues started the tournament slowly, falling to Uganda on opening day last Thursday.\n\nThankfully, the Karabo Motlhanka-led outfit crafted the perfect response with a brand of explosive and exciting cricket to particularly blow away lightweights, Mozambique in the final group stage match on Monday.\n\nA day earlier, Botswana held on for a deserved 11-run win over Ghana in a game in which several players raised their hands with gritty performances. Motlhanka has led from the front, hitting 30 from 28 balls against Ghana before top scoring with a quick-fire 56 from 42 balls.\n\nThatayaone Tshose also weighed in with a blistering 49 from just 14 balls as Botswana piled the highest runs (185) on their way to defeating Mozambique by 91 runs. The team appears balanced all the way through with Reginald Nehonde and Motlhanka establishing a solid opening partnership.\n\nThere is the insurance of Master Inzamamul while Phemelo Silas is coming of age. Botswana gave debuts to Leano Maphane and Boteng Maphosa as the Botswana Cricket Association (BCA) starts to reap the fruits of a robust development programme.\n\nWhile the batting has come to the party, it has been the exploits of spin bowler, Dhruv Maisuria that have ruthlessly put opponents to the sword. Maisuria took five wickets against Ghana to turn the match on its head before he ripped through the Mozambique order with a return of four wickets for just five runs in his four overs. It has been a brilliant comeback after his wicket-less toil against Uganda.\n\nHowever, Botswana’s biggest examination comes against a plucky Tanzania side at the Sahara Park Willowmoore Cricket Stadium when the clock strikes two. Coach Joseph Angara is cautiously optimistic ahead of the Tanzania tie.\n\n“The camp is looking good and the boys are upbeat and excited to be in the semi-finals. The majority of the boys are in good form as we have improved in every game from the preliminary game. Tanzania is a good side and we will not take them lightly,” Angara said.\n\nHis skipper, Motlhanka said they \"want to really play and enjoy the match\". “The mood is positive in the camp at the minute, obviously we are not the favourites but it gives us the freedom to play. We're looking to express ourselves and enjoy the occasion to its fullest and that of course includes winning the match,” Motlhanka said.",
    "Australia's Sandfire to boost output at Botswana's Motheo copper mine": "GABORONE, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Australia's Sandfire Resources Ltd (SFR.AX) plans to spend additional $71.9 million to expand production at Botswana's newest copper mine as it looks to establish a major mining hub in the Kalahari Copper Belt, the company said on Tuesday.\n\nSandfire's Motheo mine is the second copper mine to be developed in the region, which extends over nearly 1,000 kilometres from northeast Botswana to western Namibia.\n\nThe mine is expected to produce 3.2 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of copper by March next year. Thereafter, the company will expand its production to 5.2 mtpa through a new processing plant and a new open pit mine, located 8 kilometers west of the mine.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nSandfire said that since the start of construction it had invested $185.4 million, which represents 47% of the total development cost estimated at $397.4 million.\n\nChief Executive Karl Simich said in a statement that the initial project was on schedule for completion in March 2023, which would allow the expansion plan to ramp up immediately following receipt of approvals.\n\n\"In parallel with this development, we are also continuing a major exploration campaign both in the near-mine area as well as across our extensive landholding in the Kalahari Copper Belt aimed at defining additional ore sources that can feed into our expanded processing hub at Motheo or support the development of new production centres across the region,” Simich said.\n\nOver its initial 12.5-year mine life, the mine is projected to deliver royalties to the Botswana Government totalling $70 million and corporate income tax in excess of $200 million.\n\nThe emerging copper belt could help Botswana diversify beyond its mainstay diamond mining, which contributes 70% to its export revenue.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nReporting by Brian Benza; Editing by Anait Miridzhanian and Bernadette Baum\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

    "Botswana dry port facility at Walvis Bay enhances trade": "Elijah Mukubonda\n\nNamibia and Botswana continue to enjoy good trade relations under the configuration framework of the Southern African Customs Union (SACU), being the oldest functional customs union in the world, having been established in 1910.\n\nIt comprises a membership of five countries, namely Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa and eSwatini.\n\nIn recent years, Namibia’s merchandise trade with Botswana has increased, with the overall exports to Botswana amounting to N$8.6 billion in 2021 as compared to the export value of N$7.5 billion recorded in 2020.\n\nOn the other hand, the value of imports from Botswana stood at N$752 million after recording N$978 million in the previous year. The effect of Covid-19 was observed in 2020’s merchandise trade between the two parties, with 2021 showing some recovery from the pandemic.\n\nThough a remarkable trade relation has been observed in recent years, there is a need to maximise the utilisation of trade capacity to boost trade between the two parties.\n\nAn analysis of the compositional changes in Namibia’s export basket to Botswana indicates that diamonds accounted for 78.2%, mineral fuels and oils (mainly light oils and preparations) with a share of 15.5%, and Portland cement accounted for 1.2% of Namibia’s total exports to Botswana.\n\nThe composition of Namibia’s imports from Botswana suggests that vaccines for veterinary medicine accounted for an average share of 42.3%; co-axial cable 16.3%; coal accounted for 5.2%, with live cattle accounting for a share of 4.6% of the total imports from Botswana in 2021.\n\nIt is, therefore, imperative for the private sectors of Namibia and Botswana to take opportunities under SACU to expand and trade in various products, including manufactured goods and services.\n\nThe dry port will not only serve a wide customer base but also, most importantly, complement the Namibian government’s effort in becoming a logistics hub for\n\nSADC.\n\nThe dry port provides the ability to ease congestion while at the same time complementing Botswana’s trading ability.\n\nA number of Namibian companies similarly stand to benefit from the operations of the dry port.\n\nLocal companies that benefit are those in the transportation and logistics (over 90% of Namibian companies), storage and warehousing sectors as well as the oil service industries.\n\nThe dry port also uses the service of Namibian clearing agencies, as well as the marketing and branding of cargos.\n\nThe facility further strengthens economic ties between the two countries and fosters inter-regional trade and subsequently leads to harmonised trading and economic growth within the Southern African community.\n\nFurthermore, Namibia benefits in terms of the port handling fees that the shipping lines will pay when docking at the port to deliver or offload consignments in transit to Botswana.\n\nIn so doing, it will enhance Namibia’s visibility as a strategic logistic hub in the region.\n\nThe Trade Facilitation Agreement, to which Namibia and Botswana belong, calls for seamless cross-border trade and as a land-locked country – the dry port at Walvis Bay enables Botswana to have direct market access to the world.\n\nAs part of the Trade Facilitation Agenda, Namibia will position herself as a strategic logistic hub and as a country that has developed various corridors to succour land-locked sister countries.\n\nHence, the port is envisaged to facilitate cross-border trade between Namibia and Botswana through the Trans-Kalahari Corridor.\n\nOf course, this will also connect highways of Namibia, commencing at the Port of Walvis Bay through Kanye and Lobatse in Botswana to South Africa, mainly to the industrial heartland of the greater Gauteng.\n\nAll the commodities that are not restricted by the port are and will be handled at the facility.\n\nThe port of Walvis Bay strategically gives a competitive positioning to Namibia as a transport hub for all regional and international trade between SADC countries, Europe, the Americas and beyond.\n\nAlready, two SADC countries, namely Botswana and Zambia, have acquired land for dry ports at Walvis Bay.\n\nConclusively, the two neighbouring countries (Namibia and Botswana) should be encouraged to forge a cordial and good relationship to enhance trade-related activities between them.\n\n*Elijah Mukubonda is the chief information officer at the Ministry of Trade and Industrialisation",

A symbiotic and inter-dependent relationship exists along our common borders,” Geingob said, speaking during the inaugural Botswana-Namibia bi-national commission.\n\n“Therefore, I call on our senior officials to fast-track the implementation of the usage of Identity Documents (IDs) as travel documents between the two countries, without delay.”\n\nCountries in the SADC bloc lifted visa requirements, but the Botswana-Namibia deal to allow nationals of the two countries to move freely across borders is without precedent."
