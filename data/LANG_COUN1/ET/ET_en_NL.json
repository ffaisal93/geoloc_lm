    "Netherlands Received Almost 17k Study Permit Applications Until July 2022": "A total of 16,630 applications for a student permit have been filed in the Netherlands up until July this year, and about 10,000 of the student applicants collected their approved residence permits at The Hague University of Applied Sciences two Saturdays ago.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAccording to a press release issued by the Immigration and Naturalisation Service (IND), which is the institute responsible for issuing residence permits to foreigners living in the Netherlands, thousands of students collected their residence permits on September 17, while a second group was scheduled to obtain their residence permits on the following Saturday, September 24.\n\n“This year, 16,630 applications for a student permit were submitted to the IND up until July. This is an increase compared to 2021. Especially students from China, India, and America come to the Netherlands to study,” the press release points out.\n\nIt further notes that the reason why the permits have been collected at the Hague University of Applied Sciences is that the latter has volunteered to facilitate the central issuance of these documents at its main location, close to NS Train Station Hollands Spoor. The university has offered enough facilities and has made sure that the distribution of approved student residence permits runs smoothly.\n\nAccording to the team leader of Registrations and International Office at The Hague University of Applied Sciences, Marlies Rexwinkel, the university knows from experience that it takes time and energy for students to get familiar with how everything works in the Netherlands.\n\nShe adds that being able to collect their residence permit quickly enables them to focus on their studies instead of bureaucratic procedures, SchengenVisaInfo.com reports.\n\n“After all, that is why they are here. If this allows us to help as many international students as possible start to their time here in the Netherlands smoothly, we are happy to play our part,” she says.\n\nCommenting on the issue, Merel Hekker, IND services manager, also says that the central issuance of residence permits has enabled the agency to deploy its staff as effectively as possible in order to avoid students waiting for months for their residence permits.\n\nTo organize the distribution of the approved study permits, 26 educational institutions have worked together closely with the IND, each of which has been individually responsible for distributing the residence permits of students enrolled with them.\n\nBack in April, Nuffic, the Dutch organization for internationalization in education, published a report called “Incoming degree mobility in Dutch higher education 2021-22,” according to which the number of international students enrolled in Dutch higher education institutions increased by 12 per cent for the 2021/2022 academic year, reaching a total of 115,068.\n\nThe majority of students were from Germany (24,500), Italy (7,200), Romania (5,600), China (5,300), Belgium (4,797), Spain (4,687), Bulgaria (4,607) and France (4,294).\n\nOn the other hand, the Netherlands marked a drop in the number of students from the United Kingdom by receiving 25 per cent fewer students than the year before.\n\n>> University of Amsterdam Tells Int’l Students to Secure Housing Before Travelling to the Netherlands",
    "Is the next pandemic brewing on the Netherlands’ poultry farms?": "Poultry farming in the Netherlands is concentrated in the southeast, a rural appendage of the oddly shaped country sandwiched between Belgium and Germany. It’s part of the Dutch “Bible Belt,” and both more religious and more Catholic than the rest of the nation—factors involved in it being the region of the country most heavily struck by COVID in early 2020, as Carnival celebrations in February and, later, church services became superspreader events.\n\nDuring World War II, the south was liberated from German occupation sooner than the rest of the country, as the Allied Operation Market Garden freed villages and towns in the Netherlands but failed to cross the Waal River, an extension of the Rhine, and drive on into Germany in the autumn of 1944. Outside Ysselsteyn in January, 20 kilometers from the German border and two kilometers from a cemetery of German war dead, a man hosed down a driveway at the Jenniskens Turkey Farm. The Dutch government doesn’t name farms where outbreaks occur, but a December 20 outbreak announcement had indicated a turkey farm, and the Jenniskens address is at the center of its map of the quarantine area that had resulted. The family’s Christmas lights were still up. Across the street, an egret stood in drenched fields.\n\nThe man in the drive declined an interview, and current regulations proscribe visiting farms, to prevent the spread of HPAI when humans step on infected droppings and carry them to another farm, or to the wild.\n\nDutch poultry farmers are now paying seven times as much for insurance as they were last year, because of all the culls, according to Jan Verhoijsen of LTO Nederland, the Dutch agricultural trade association. “We have had a lot of flu this year, and it costs a lot of money, but we don’t want to have the problem that people get sick,” he says. “So consumption stays on a normal level, and that for us is more important—better to pay more than the problem is going over to our consumer.”\n\nBeerens and Stegeman praised Dutch farmers’ biosecurity practices, such as maintaining a tray of disinfectant liquid which anyone entering a farm or barn must first step through and disinfecting the wheels of vehicles entering or leaving the farm. Each farm must undergo a biosecurity check at the beginning of autumn, regardless of whether an outbreak is already underway. Indeed, instances of transmission between farms have been few this season.\n\nA veterinarian by training, Stegeman would like to see prophylactic measures go further, such as designing farmyards so they’re unattractive to wild birds—by, for example, filling in ponds and cleaning up loose straw—and requiring workers to change clothes on the way in, like the scientists at a BSL 4 lab. Researchers are investigating new methods to prevent or limit outbreaks, including lasers that discourage wild birds from flying over farms and improved air filters at poultry facilities. “The big difficulty for biosecurity is that it has to be 24-7-365,” Stegeman says. “You can’t fail once.”\n\nThe Dutch expert group noted that reducing farm density and the number of animals raised on each farm would ameliorate zoonotic risk. “Spreading out these farms geographically and making farms smaller, that should reduce the likelihood of zoonosis,” Stegeman says. That land-use change could be managed through policy, and ideally new farms would be placed in less water-rich areas and hence away from large congregations of wild birds. But Verhoijsen dismisses these ideas, citing the low level of between-farm transmission as evidence that intensive poultry farming is not the prime contributor to HPAI spread. (In August, though, it was found on a farm within 10 kilometers of 235 other poultry farms, a situation that the Minister of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality at the time, Henk Staghouwer, reportedly called “extremely worrying.” Within two weeks, two farms inside the 10-kilometer quarantine zone were stricken.)\n\n“It's the wild birds that fly in the air, that is what we think makes the biggest problems,” he says. “Our government wants more and more nature, and more water where birds can live, but we say that is also getting more risk for bird flu for our farmers.”\n\nUltimately, as Kuiken suggested, the only solution may be for everyone to just eat less poultry and fewer eggs. Even that might not be enough now that HPAI might be endemic in wild birds, according to EFSA. “Reassortment events will continue and zoonotic transmission of avian influenza viruses cannot be fully excluded in general when avian influenza viruses are present in birds,” EFSA noted in a March report.\n\nMeanwhile, swine can host both human and avian flu viruses, making them a vessel for dangerous reassortment, and influenza is now endemic in Dutch pig barns because of the high rate of production of piglets; researchers worried when 18 people in Ohio and Michigan became ill from H3N2 in 2016, and early information seemed to indicate person-to-person transmission, though it was later ruled out. The Netherlands conducts almost no surveillance of swine flu.\n\nAmerican and European officials assert that their inspection and culling programs are sufficient to keep HPAI-infected poultry out of the food supply, and that people won’t become ill from eating properly prepared poultry, anyway. But in Indonesia and elsewhere in Asia, programs to reimburse chicken farmers for culling flocks when bird flu is detected simply don’t exist. So they sell their sick birds, still living, for consumption.",
    "Croatia and Netherlands into Nations League semi-finals": "Croatia and the Netherlands booked their places in the last four of the Nations League as champions France needed a favour to avoid relegation from the top tier on Sunday.\n\nLes Bleus were beaten 2-0 in Denmark to finish with just one win from their six group games, but Croatia's 3-1 win at Austria saved the world champions from the drop.\n\nDidier Deschamps will be hoping to have a number of key men back from injury by the time France's defence of the World Cup begins against Australia on November 22.\n\nThey will also come up against the Danes in the group stage in Qatar and the Euro 2020 semi-finalists showed they are more than capable of causing France more trouble in two months' time.\n\nBoth goals came before half-time as Kasper Dolberg stretched to turn home Mikkel Damsgaard's cross before Andreas Skov Olsen volleyed in from the edge of the area.\n\nFrance were without Hugo Lloris, Jules Kounde, N'Golo Kante, Paul Pogba and Karim Benzema through injury.\n\nBut the star trio of Antoine Griezmann, Olivier Giroud and Kylian Mbappe failed to find a way back into the game.\n\nDenmark's win meant Croatia needed to get all three points in Austria to top the group.\n\nLuka Modric got the 2018 World Cup finalists off to a flying start, but they were quickly pegged back by Christoph Baumgartner's header.\n\nTwo goals in three second half minutes proved decisive as Marko Livaja and Dejan Lovren headed in at the far post.\n\nDefeat relegated Austria to League B.\n\nThe Netherlands made sure of top spot in Group A4 with a 1-0 win over Belgium thanks to Virgil van Dijk's header 17 minutes from time.\n\nThe Dutch just needed to avoid defeat by a three-goal margin after winning 4-1 in Brussels earlier in the group.\n\nA Belgian revival never looked likely and Van Dijk settled the game when he was left completely unmarked to head in a corner inside the six-yard box.",

    "Preview: United States v Netherlands": "What the teams are saying\n\nReturning to the same court a day after defeat is not something players face often on Tour, but Fritz sees nothing but positives in the situation.\n\n“If anything, it's better I'd say,” he said. “You don't get to play yourself into a tournament if you lose early. I always feel like once I play a match on the court, I'll always come back the next day and I'll feel better and get used to the conditions.”\n\nAs for the kind of match Botic Van de Zandschulp expects in his first singles meeting with Fritz, the Dutchman said, “He's serving well, hitting the ball well from the baseline, and can hit winners from everywhere, I think. Yeah, it's going to be a good match.”\n\nThe prize on offer is not lost on Netherlands captain Paul Haarhuis as he looks ahead to Malaga in November: “This is very big for us. Whoever finishes first, on paper, has a much better draw. It’s fantastic that we qualified, that was our main goal, but one tie decides whether we finish on top, and we’re going all in.”\n\nIf this is to be Bob Bryan’s last tie as USA’s captain – at least for now – the stand-in has had a great time on the bench. “It’s fun. I love being out there with the guys and seeing that tennis up close, and trying to keep their energy up. I’m doing what I can, but these guys are all such great competitors and such great players I'm in awe of the tennis they're playing out here this week.”",
    "Strong Dutch presence at the New Mobility Congress in Łódź, Poland": "Strong Dutch presence at the New Mobility Congress in Łódź, Poland\n\nFrom 12 to 14 September, a business delegation of 12 companies from the Netherlands participated in the New Mobility Congress 2022.\n\nNMC2002\n\nThis year’s edition, the third and most successful one so far, took place in the fantastically renovated EC1 in Łódż and offered a three-day programme on a wide variety of topics, with 81 panels and 241 speakers from all over Europe. The event was organized by the Polish Alternative Fuels Association (PSPA) and hosted a record number of 1598 participants, becoming the largest-scale trade event on sustainable mobility in Poland. It effectively brought together all relevant players in the Polish mobility sector, including the automotive industry, transport companies, providers of mobility services, companies developing electromobility and policymakers from the public sector. The Netherlands’ ambassador to Poland, Daphne Bergsma, officially opened the congress, together with other dignatories, among which the mayor of Łódż, Hanna Zdanowska.\n\nDutch footprint\n\nSeizing the occasion of the NMC, the Netherlands Embassy in Poland decided to offer an \"Exhibition Participation Package\" for the Dutch private sector, under the Support for International Business Programme of the RVO, the aim being to introduce or position Dutch business in the fastly growing Polish mobility sector. The group of company representatives from the Netherlands that applied for the package turned out to be very diverse in background, scale, branch, interest and experience in Poland, resulting in serendipitous exchanges and a remarkably good vibe. We had small and large companies on board, involved in charging infrastructure (Alfen, Fastned, Volt Time, CV Charging Europe), smart energy and mobility solutions (Brenergie, LastMileSolutions), lease (Leaseplan), automotive (DAF Trucks), energy storage (e-ATEPS, StoragePartners), IT-solutions (Sourceful) and a venture capital fund (Urban Impact Ventures).\n\nActivities and visibility\n\nA total of 73 match-making meetings were held, with the invaluable suppport of Elro van den Burg of the Netherlands Polish Chamber of Commerce (NPCC). An other meet&greet-moment was the networking event hosted by the Embassy. Just before the congress, PSPA recorded a podcast in which a number of the Dutch companies presented themselves and the Economic Counsellor of the Netherlands Embassy, Sanne Kaasjager, reflected on developments and opportunities in Polish mobility. A special market survey “Poland Drives e-Mobility 2022”, commissioned by RVO and written by PSPA, provided the basis for that reflection and was also officially presented at the NMC2022. Many of the Dutch business representatives took active part in various panels. Michiel Langezaal, CEO of FastNed, made a keynote speech in the main hall. Herman Sips, representative of the Dutch ministry of Infrastructure and Water, responsible for the campaign to promote the Global MoU on electrification of heavy transport, contributed online in a highly interesting panel with representatives of leading e-truck manufacturers. The centrally-located NL Pavilion did its work by providing a “poster” for the Dutch brands and a lively meeting point. Visitors could also put on special Virtual Reality glasses with 3D-presentations of various Dutch sectors. A total of 54 people seized this new way of visualizing Dutch products and services way of doing business (and sometimes a little seasick). The abundantly present Polish media conducted 6 TV interviews with business and embassy representatives, increasing the Dutch visibility even more.\n\nOpportunities and potential areas for Dutch-Polish cooperation\n\nSo, what are the most potential areas for cooperation and growth? The analists of PSPA concluded that for Dutch investors and providers there are four areas to look at with particular interest: electrification of heavy transport, expansion of a public and private charging infrastructure, lithium-ion battery production and mobility-as-a-service. All Dutch participants where positively surprised by the potential of the Polish market and indicated a clear interest to come back next year. The Netherlands Embassy thanks all involved, especially the NPCC, RVO, the ministry of Infrastructure & Water, and especially the representatives of the Dutch companies for their interest and enthousiastic contributions.",

    "High-level FSO Safer Side Event Co-hosted by the Netherlands, the United States and Germany: Funding Gap Closed for First Stage of Salvage Operation": "The high-level side event at the United Nations General Assembly Week, co-hosted by the Netherlands, the United States and Germany, honoured the joint effort with the UN to prevent a looming environmental disaster with severe humanitarian and economic costs. To prevent this catastrophe the UN has coordinated – in close consultation with Yemeni parties – an operational plan. The estimated budget for the two-track plan is $113 million, of which $75 million is required to start the first phase of the operation (emergency operation). The United States, the UN, and the Netherlands partnered in April 2022 to launch an intensive awareness-raising campaign. Since the pledging conference in May 2022 – jointly organized by the Government of the Netherlands and the UN – many donors have pledged generously. At the high-level side event, we reached an important milestone as we have closed the funding gap for the emergency operation. The co-hosts are the biggest donors backing the UN-led plan, with 15 million Euros from the Netherlands, 12 million Euros from Germany and $10 million from the United States, followed by Saudi Arabia ($10 million) and the United Kingdom ($7.5 million). The co-hosts will continue their outreach to mobilize the funding needed to finalize the operation.\n\nMinister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation of the Netherlands Liesje Schreinemacher: “Normally, as minister, it is my job to deal with the repercussions of disasters. But in this instance, we have a chance to prevent a disaster. The Safer is a ticking timebomb. We need swift action. It is encouraging that so many countries have pledged their financial support. Thanks in part to the Netherlands’ contribution we now have the necessary funds to start salvaging the vessel.”\n\nU.S. Special Envoy for Yemen Tim Lenderking: “We are proud that the United States pledged $10 million for the UN Safer project. Our contribution stands alongside contributions from a range of countries, organizations, and individuals across the globe, representing a broad coalition of partners that understands the importance of preventing an economic and environmental catastrophe in the Red Sea.”\n\nDirector General for Crisis Prevention, Stabilisation, Peace Building and Humanitarian Assistance of the German Federal Foreign Office Deike Potzel: “Thanks to our continued joint efforts, we have a rare opportunity here, to tell a story not often told: the story of how we prevented a catastrophe! With its contribution of 12 million, Germany significantly contributes to this accomplishment. If all parties to the conflict stick to the agreement made to rescue the FSO Safer and the operation is successful, the FSO Safer can go from being a symbol of impending disaster to a beacon of hope for Yemen!”\n\nThanks to the mobilization and financial support of donor countries from the region and from all over the world, the operation is expected to start soon. It is now crucial that the donors swiftly disburse their contributions to allow UNDP, the UN organization coordinating the implementation, to sign all necessary contracts.\n\nIn New York, the UN gave insights into the operational plan: first transferring the oil into a safe vessel (Phase I), before installing a permanent storage solution and scrapping the Safer (Phase II). Phase II requires an additional $38 million. The co-hosts will continue their efforts and urge additional pledges in particular from the private sector to fulfil Phase II.",
    "How the Dutch league hopes to catch up to its national team": "Feyenoord are one of the most storied clubs in Dutch football. Over their 114-year history, they've amassed 15 league titles, 13 cups, and multiple European titles.\n\nTheir women's first team history is nowhere near as long. In fact, they only have a single full season under their belt. Understandably, it’s also nowhere near as illustrious as that of their male counterparts.\n\nManon Melis is the woman tasked with changing that, and helping further bolster the foundations of Dutch women's football.\n\nThe Rotterdam native is the seventh most-capped woman in Dutch history. After a successful, swashbuckling career featuring stops in the Netherlands, Sweden and the United States, Melis hung up her boots and has been Feyenoord’s Director of Women’s Development since 2017.\n\nShe's overseen the evolution of Feyenoord's women's department from a couple of youth and girls' teams to the establishment of a women’s side in the Dutch first division. Feyenoord had to balance the hefty expectations tied to their well-established name with the challenges facing any new club.\n\nManon Melis has helped build Feyenoord's women's program from scratch.\n\n\"We know what we're doing and how we want to do it. But you know, everybody else thinks Feyenoord is a big name in the Netherlands. So they have expectations, but it's really important to keep the focus on your own goals and how we want to do things,\" Melis told DW.\n\nFeyenoord had a respectable outing in their opening campaign, finishing fifth out of nine teams. They've started their second season on firm footing, winning both their matches so far.\n\nThe Dutch National team's explosive growth\n\nWhile Feyenoord are playing catch up to other Dutch sides, rival clubs didn't have as long of a headstart as one might guess. Big-spending PSV and Ajax only launched women's teams in 2012, and 8-time title winner Twente is ancient by comparison, having been founded in 2007.\n\nEven these sides, dominant in the Netherlands, struggle internationally. Ajax may have the chance to knock out Arsenal ahead of this season's group stages on Wednesday, after a 2-2 draw in the first leg of their playoff. But no Dutch team has made it past the Champions League round of 16 since 2006, before it was rebranded.\n\nThe Dutch league's diminutive stature makes it all the more impressive that the Netherlands have morphed into one of the stronger teams in Europe. While they came up short of defending their Euros title this summer, the Netherlands have evolved into contenders at both the European and global level.\n\n\"I think with the national team, things went a lot faster. Even with things like facilities, or how many times you can practice in a week, these things improved faster [than at the club level]. And of course, a lot of our girls are playing in different leagues, for some of the best clubs in Europe,\" said Melis.\n\n\"After Euro 2017 everything changed. Beforehand the team wasn't that popular. Afterwards [the Netherlands] began playing in front of full stadiums, and more players started going abroad,\" she continued.\n\nLeaving the Netherlands remains the most viable way for Dutch players to test themselves at the highest level. Still, more than half of the Dutch Euro 2022 squad were based in the Eredivisie, which means the national team can't rely solely on players earning their wages in France, England, Germany or Spain.\n\nThe professionalization push\n\nAccording to Melis, conditions at Feyenoord are nearly unrecognizable from her playing days. \"They're totally different worlds. Everything changed in recent years. The competition in the Netherlands improved, especially when it comes to facilities. When I started we were all amateurs. Now, clubs like Ajax, PSV, Feyenoord have really nice conditions. It's normal for young girls now,\" she said.\n\nStill, women's teams with deep-pockets are a relative anomaly in the Netherlands. Melis estimates that only a few teams are fully professional, and semi-pro Feyenoord still have a long way to go on that front.\n\n\"We have some of the girls work for the club on various projects, and a lot of other girls are at university or studying. We can't offer for them to be professional players yet, but hope in a few years we will be able to,\" she said.\n\nEngland, France and Sweden currently have fully-professional women’s leagues, and Italy and Spain just joined their ranks this season. According to Nadine Kessler, UEFA's Head of Women's Football, expanding that number further is a major element to growing women's football on the continent.\n\nVivianne Miedema is one of a number of Dutch players who had to leave to play abroad early\n\n\"We need to really make sure that all of these doors are open right now to all girls all over Europe. What England did with the Women's Super League needs to happen across Europe. I always say five to 10 professional leagues, that's when we make change. That's when the parent says, 'Okay, there's a job opportunity out there for my girl, that's something I'd really push her to do',\" Kessler said at a press conference before the Euros kicked off.\n\nWhile the relatively slow growth of Dutch domestic football seems odd in light of the national teams successes, it's reflective of the broader state of women's clubs football. Full-professionalization for Feyenoord and the rest of the Eredivisie might be a ways out, but Melis at least has clearer immediate objectives.\n\n\"If you see Lyon or Barcelona, their budget is different than what we have here in the Netherlands. So I don't know if we can reach that. But it's also about the young, talented players. We need to focus on our own youth players and trying to have them stay longer in the Dutch competition,\" she said.\n\nHolding on to top talents a bit longer would help raise the overall level of the Eredivisie, and as the game continues to grow, could bring in transfer fees down the line. If Feyenoord were around a decade ago, they might have been able to sign one of the club's biggest fans, Vivienne Miedema.\n\nMiedema, who recently eclipsed Melis as the highest goal scorer in Netherlands history, grew up watching the Feyenoord men play with her family. Further growth at clubs like Feyenoord means the next Miedemas might be able to launch their careers at their childhood club.",
    "Netherlands is heating up twice as fast as global average: KNMI researcher": "The temperature in the Netherlands is continuing to warm up. In the future, the hottest days could even increase up to four times faster than the global average, a climate researcher told Het Parool.\n\nGerard van der Schrier, a climate researcher at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI), told the paper that the Netherlands is currently heating up twice as fast as the global average, \"mainly because we have so much sun.\"\n\nThis warming can also worsen droughts, such as the one the Netherlands experienced this summer. However, this year's drought was a \"matter of chance\" and not a byproduct of climate change, said Peter Siegmund, another KNMI researcher.\n\nAround the world, oceans are warming up and the weather is becoming wetter. But this is not evenly spread across the globe, Siegmund explained. As a result, some areas are actually becoming drier. The forecast for the Netherlands largely depends on the amount of fossil fuels people continue to burn, Siegmund said.\n\n\"We expect it to become sunnier and drier in the future, especially in the summer, while the winters are slightly warmer and wetter,\" Siegmund said. “Southern Europe is expected to be drier, Northern Europe wetter, and we are somewhere in between.\"\n\nThe KNMI researcher called Amsterdam \"the new Paris\" based on historical data.

Two minutes later McMullan denied Banel once again.\n\nDundas had a shot blocked as the Dutch continued to press, while Netherlands captain Livano Comenencia was stopped in his tracks.\n\nAs the game wore on the Northern Ireland defence had to withstand plenty of pressure.\n\nAround the 80-minute mark Dutch attacker Bayren Strijdonck had a shot blocked and midfielder Dave Kwakman scooped the rebound wide of the post.\n\nSloan forced a save out of Van Sas before Strijdonck was presented with another opportunity, however he failed to hit the target, and that was the last meaningful action of the match.\n\nThe Dutch had 11 attempts on goal in the game, with two on target, while Northern Ireland had five attempts with two on target.\n\nNorthern Ireland’s final group match is against Moldova, again at Sportpark Marsdijk, on Tuesday (27 September, 6.30pm UK time), while the Dutch and Slovenians will face each other on Tuesday. Slovenia defeated Moldova 4-0 this afternoon.\n\nGerard Lyttle will be hoping his side can defeat the Moldovans and either the Dutch or Slovenians can win their game.

    "Solaris to deliver 10 MetroStyle trolleybuses to Arnhem in the Netherlands": "Solaris and Dutch operator Hermes, part of Transdev/Connexxion, have signed a contract for the delivery of 10 Trollino 18 trolleybuses featuring our unique MetroStyle design\n\nSolaris and Dutch operator Hermes, part of Transdev/Connexxion, have signed a contract for the delivery of 10 Trollino 18 trolleybuses featuring our unique MetroStyle design. These emission-free trolleybuses will significantly contribute to boosting innovative public transport in the Arnhem Nijmegen region as well as in the entire province of Gelderland. The vehicles will make their way to Arnhem in the first half of 2024 and they will be the first Solaris trolleybuses to be deployed in the Netherlands.\n\nSolaris has been working for many years with Hermes, a carrier which is part of the Transdev Netherlands group, a leader in emission-free public transport in the Netherlands. Arnhem, a city of over 150,000 inhabitants and located on the Nederrijn river, is an important industrial, scientific and cultural centre. The ten modern Trollino 18s to be delivered by Solaris will allow it to expand its transport network between the University in Arnhem and the University in Wageningen. These will be the first Solaris trolleybuses in the Netherlands.\n\nThey will stand out due to their dynamic and stylish MetroStyle look. This unique design has been developed by Solaris as a response to the latest trends in the public transport industry. The first Solaris vehicle built sporting the new design was the Trollino 24, showcased at Busworld Europe 2019 in Brussels.\n\n“We are very proud that our Solaris Trollino 18 vehicles will arrive in Arnhem soon. This is the only Dutch city with an operating trolleybus system. We are therefore particularly pleased that its residents will soon be able to travel on board the most modern Solaris trolleybuses”, said Wil Willems, Managing Director of Solaris Netherlands.\n\n“We are very much looking forward to the next chapter in our collaboration with Solaris. Our goal is to provide the residents of the Netherlands with the most comfortable, state-of-the-art, and environmentally-friendly solutions for public transport. We are absolutely certain that Solaris Trollino 18 trolleybuses are just such a choice”, said Martijn Mentink, Executive Director at Hermes for the South-East Region.\n\nOne important feature of the trolleybuses ordered by Hermes is that they will be able to drive without being connected to overhead wires. This will be possible due to traction batteries with a capacity of around 90 kWh. Thanks to these batteries, the vehicles will be able to cover a distance of up to a few dozen kilometres without needing to be connected to the overhead line network. The batteries will be charged using the “In-Motion-Charging” system, directly while travelling using the overhead wires. The Solaris Trollino 18 trolleybuses will be equipped with a 240 kW electric motor.\n\nThe comfortable, air-conditioned and spacious trolleybus interior will be adapted to the needs of people with disabilities, i.e. it will feature, among other things, two functional wheelchair bays. What is more, to enhance both travel comfort and safety, the vehicles will boast a range of cutting-edge solutions such as USB charging ports for mobile devices, a passenger information system, and a video surveillance system. These solutions will also include Mobileye Shield+, a system that uses sound and visual alerts to warn the driver about any objects detected in the blind spot of the vehicle. Enhanced visibility for the driver will be ensured by cameras that replace side mirrors, transmitting images on screens inside the vehicle. Among its many other advantages, the innovative design of MirrorEye has allowed the width of the vehicle to be reduced.\n\nThe first Solaris vehicles made it to the Netherlands in 2017 when Transdev placed an order for 40 articulated Solaris Urbino 18 buses. Since then, the fleet of Solaris vehicles plying the streets of towns and cities in the Netherlands has been expanded by the addition of 26 more vehicles, including 16 hydrogen buses. Trolleybuses have been part of the Solaris offering since 2000. To date, nearly 2,000 vehicles of this type have been delivered to 60 towns and cities in 18 countries.\n\nIn the picture, from the left: Bart Kraaijvanger, Zero Emission Program Manager for Transdev Netherlands, Martijn Mentink, Executive Director at Hermes for the South-East Region, Wil Willems, Managing Director of Solaris Netherlands B.V., Bartłomiej Cieślik, Senior Area Manager, Solaris Bus & Coach sp. z o.o.\n\nSOURCE: Solaris",
    "Holland or Netherlands: how should we refer to the ‘Oranje’ soccer team?": "The Netherlands national football team have been a fixture on the international stage for decades, participating in 10 World Cup and 10 European Championships, winning the continental competition in 1988 and reaching the final of the global tournament three times, in 1974, 1978 and 2010. The Oranje have been represented by some of the finest players ever to lace up a pair of boots, from Eddy de Neve, Abe Lentra and Faas Wilkes to Johan Cruyff, Ruud Gullit, Frank Rijkaard, Marco van Basten, Dennis Bergkamp and Robin van Persie.\n\nBut there is some confusion as to the correct name for the national side. The Dutch national team are commonly known as the Netherlands or Holland: is one more correct than the other? In reality, both names are used as often as the other. On the Netherlands’ official tourism website, both Holland and the Dutch national team are used liberally to refer to the Oranje.\n\nWhat’s the difference between Holland and the Netherlands?\n\nBefore unification of the Republic of Seven United Netherlands, or the Dutch Republic, as the Batavian Republic under French dominion in 1795, when Napoleon’s troops invaded, the Netherlands was not a kingdom. This changed when William I, the Prince of Orange, returned to the country in 1813 to fill the void after Napoleon’s brother, Louis, was forced to abdicate. William I created a United Netherlands as a kingdom, but the southern regions opposed unification and gained independence in 1830 as Belgium. The Dutch national team’s nickname, Oranje, comes from the House of Orange-Nassau, of which William I was a scion and which remains the reigning royal house in the Netherlands to this date.\n\nThe word Netherlands in Dutch literally means “low countries,” and is sometimes also used to refer to the wider association of the Benelux nations – Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.\n\nThe term Holland historically only refers to two of the Netherlands’ 12 provinces, Noord-Holland and Zuid-Holland, but as these were traditionally the source of most of the country’s wealth and economic output, it became commonplace to use the term Holland to refer to the whole country.",

    "Europe's energy crisis and the Netherlands' 1,000 billion buried treasure": "Despite skyrocketing energy prices and a shortage of natural gas supply in the European Union, the Dutch government has taken the decision to proceed with the closure of natural gas wells in the Groningen region. The field is one of the biggest in the world, worth up to 1000 billion Euros. But for now, it's a treasure that will remain untapped for the forseeable future.\n\nThe reason the decision was taken was because of seismic shocks triggered by the gas extraction in the area. Some 1200 earthquakes have been recorded so far, with around 27,000 homes being severely damaged and deemed unsafe to live in. That's according Jan Wigboldus, president of the Groningen Gas Council, an umbrella group representing civil society organisations in the impacted region.\n\nSeverely damaged house from earthquake activity Euronews\n\nBut a growing number of experts are urging the government to overhaul its decision – and to extend gas extraction for at least a few more years. This, they argue, could help to secure a future supply of gas and help to bring down energy prices.\n\nMachiel Mulder, is the Professor of Regulation of Energy Markets at the University of Groningen.\n\n“The field could be re-opened in case of an emergency situation. So when people living in Germany, Estonia or other countries are really experiencing a shortage of gas, this is an emergency situation. And then the decision will be reconsidered whether to re-open the gasfield from Groningen to produce more.”\n\nAn alternative to gas-extraction at home is the importation of gas from abroad. The Netherlands has now put into operation a supplementary LNG terminal. Other countries – such as Germany and France, are also setting up new infrastructure to import liquified natural gas.\n\nSome 81.000 jobs are linked to the Dutch greenhouse industry, and half of the companies face financial problems due to the rising gas prices.\n\n81.000 jobs are linked to the Dutch greenhouse industry Euronews\n\nExtending the Groningen gas field extraction could ease their situation, but the industry is also taking measures to adapt to the new reality, as Greenhouse Manager, Juliska van der Breggen explains.\n\n\"We had to close one location and 30 percent of our employees we had to say good-bye. The problem is the high energy prices, and we have to reduce the use of our using of energy. It is possible to reduce for 30 percent. Our whole branch we can reduce 900 million cubic metres of gas.\"\n\nTo put this into perspective, 900 million cubic metres of gas is equivalent to powering three Dutch cities.\n\nBut will actions like this one be enough? The Netherlands have relaunched their coal power stations and that’s bad news for the climate. Using gas from Groningen would be less harmful to the environment, but for now, at least, it doesn't seem likely that the government will change its decision.",
    "Top 10 goalscorers for Netherlands national football team": "Some of the biggest legends of the game have played for the Dutch\n\nThe Netherlands have always been favourites at every tournament, due to their rich squad strength and extensive experience at major tournaments; despite only winning one major title, the Dutch remain a threat in a major competition.\n\nReaching the 2010 World Cup final and the 2014 World Cup semi-finals demonstrate how brilliant their players have been, despite not winning either. Their only World Cup win came in 1988, when they were led by the legendary Marco van Basten.\n\nThe Netherlands have struggled to win any competition since then. But they can now compete with any powerhouse, as the country has seen lethal strikers at their disposal. The national team consists of many world-class players at the moment. We have ranked them below.\n\n10. Johan Cruyff – 33 goals\n\nThe Netherlands’ greatest legend, Cruyff had the world at his feet both as a manager and a player. The way he inspired the Dutch team to become one of the best in the world is now a legend. Johan Cruyff was synonymous with football and led the Netherlands to the 1974 World Cup finals. He was an influential player, steering them to World Cup qualification in 1978, but was unable to participate due to high political unrest, and his family was threatened with kidnapping.\n\nCruyff retired with 33 goals in 48 games for the Netherlands after being named European Player of the Century in 1999 and runner-up in the World Player of the Century poll.\n\n9. Abe Lenstra – 33 goals\n\nAbe Lenstra was a member of the greatest Heerenveen team in history and was one of only a few players to score on his debut and final match for the national team. His awareness and eye for goal distinguished him as a great striker. He formed an excellent attacking partnership with Wilkes but was rarely used as a striker. Despite this, Lenstra managed to score 33 goals in 44 appearances.\n\n8. Ruud van Nistelrooy – 35 goals\n\nRuud van Nistelrooy scored 35 goals in 70 games for Netherlands (Courtesy: Manchester United)\n\nThe terrific striker had an illustrious club career as well as a starring role for the Netherlands on their way to glory. He did not win an international trophy, but he was an asset to the team, scoring 35 goals in 70 games for the Netherlands. His best performance came in the 2006 Euros when he scored four goals, but the Oranje were eliminated in the semi-final against Portugal. Nistelrooy’s last game came in 2008 in the Euros, where he scored a brace before hanging his boots.\n\n7. Faas Wilkes – 35 goals\n\nWilkes had one of the best goals per match ratio, 0.92, and his desire to score goals earned him a higher status with the national team, where he scored 35 goals in 38 appearances. Wilkes played fewer games, but his name was on every match scoresheet, well almost. Besides scoring goals, he was a creative player with excellent dribbling skills.\n\n6. Arjen Robben – 37 goals\n\nAlthough he was not used as a false nine, the pacy winger scored 37 goals in 96 appearances for the national team. Robben played in three World Cups and three Euros. He was the most important player in the squad, with a burst of speed that beat many defenders. He would have won the World Cup in 2010 if he hadn’t missed a one-on-one against Iker Casillas.\n\nAfter reaching the World Cup semi-finals in 2014, the Netherlands were unable to secure their place in the 2018 World Cup. The former Bayern Munich player subsequently announced his retirement.\n\n5. Dennis Bergkamp – 37 goals\n\nDespite scoring fewer goals, he was one of the most clever attackers in Dutch history. He was capable of netting as well as feeding goals to other players. His first international appearance was against Greece. His on-field mentality inspired the country to great runs in many World Cups, and the player was praised for his long-range goals. Bergkamp announced his retirement in Euro 2000, after losing on penalties to Italy and scoring 37 goals in 79 games.\n\n4. Patrick Kluivert – 40 goals\n\nKluivert, one of Europe’s most lethal strikers, scored his first national team goal against Malta in 1995, and the rest is history. The Dutch international was a big game player with exemplary striking abilities, scoring a famous goal against Argentina in the quarter-finals and an equaliser against Brazil in the 1998 World Cup. However, they lost in a penalty shootout, but Kluivert was a standout performer. He concluded his national career with 40 goals in 79 national team appearances.\n\n3. Memphis Depay – 42 goals\n\nDepay has scored 42 goals for the Dutch national team (Courtesy: Barcelona)\n\nDepay had a slow start, but he quickly picked up the momentum and is now only eight goals away from becoming the national team’s all-time leading scorer. His club performance impressed van Gaal, and he was called up by the manager for the 2014 World Cup. The current-Barcelona striker made a stellar debut as Netherlands were on the verge of drawing against Australia; Depay came on as a substitute and assisted Van Persie before scoring a goal, making him the national team’s youngest goal-scorer.\n\nThe player now has 42 goals to his name, and the team has qualified for the 2022 World Cup. Depay will have high ambitions in the tournament, as he will be their most reliable striker in the competition.\n\n2. Klaas-Jan Huntelaar – 42 goals\n\nHuntelaar may have flown under the radar by fans, but he is the Netherlands’ second-highest scorer, and his breakthrough came in 2006 when he scored a brace and assisted against Ireland. He hasn’t looked back since and has been on a goal-scoring streak ever since.\n\nHuntelaar went on to play in two European Championships and two World Cups, scoring 42 goals in 76 games. His best game came against San Marino when he scored three goals and assisted another.\n\n1. Robin van Persie – 50 goals\n\nVan Persie was a clinical finisher who scored many goals to become the Dutch team’s top scorer. In 102 appearances for the national team, the former Manchester United player scored 50 goals. Van Persie was integral in the Netherlands’ World Cup run in 2014, and his famous header against Spain was nominated for the Puskas award as well.\n\nIn the same tournament, he became the only player in World Cup history to score with his left foot, right foot, head, free-kick, and penalty. His last game was a 4-0 loss to France in a bid to qualify for the 2018 World Cup.\n\nFor more updates, follow Khel Now on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram and join our community on Telegram.",
    "Netherlands springs from nowhere to emerge as China's biggest gasoil buyer in Aug": "China's exports of rare gasoil cargoes to the Netherlands in August marked record-high shipments to Europe, as the arbitrage sales window was opened amid a rapid gas-to-oil switching trend in the West, industry and trading sources said over Sept. 20-21, citing latest data from China's General Administration of Customs.\n\nNot registered? Receive daily email alerts, subscriber notes & personalize your experience. Register Now\n\nThe August exports of 257,000 mt, or around 1.93 million barrels of gasoil to the Netherlands, surpassed the previous record of 223,000 mt in March 2020, customs data showed, placing the Dutch state as the top destination for China's gasoil exports.\n\nAugust shipments from China also accounted for 31% of the total 829,000 mt of the middle distillate products exported over the same month, customs data showed.\n\nExports to the Netherlands were largely attributed to healthy arbitrage sales margins from East to West, according to sources.\n\nAs Russia continues to threaten major European economies by tightening its gas supplies, European traders are willing to pay some premiums to pick up additional gasoil from the Far East so that they can actively stock up on liquid fuels to support the region's power and industrial sectors, as well as for heating needs, according to middle distillate marketers at major Chinese, South Korean and Malaysian refiners.\n\nChina hardly exported any cargoes to Europe in the past 13 months, with just 83,000 mt, or 623,000 barrels, sent to west of the Suez in June 2021.\n\nThe front-month gasoil Exchange of Futures for swaps spread -- a key indicator of East-West arbitrage economics -- averaged minus $31.78/mt in August, widening from an average of minus $29.17/mt over July, S&P Global Commodity Insights' data showed, reflecting improving economics to sell Asian gasoil barrels on arbitrage routes to the West.\n\nIn Europe, refiners, power producers, and major industries are likely to account for a 308,000 b/d growth in liquids demand in the first quarter of 2023, according to S&P Global, equivalent to about half the global share of gas-to-oil switching. The growth figure surpasses the 166,000 b/d level, or 47%, in Q3 2022.\n\nGasoline exports to Pakistan\n\nIn August, China exported around 109,000 mt of gasoline to Pakistan, marginally lower by 2.4% on the month, bringing the year-to-date exports to 1.67 million mt over the first eight months of the year, up 79.9% from a year earlier.\n\nThis kept Pakistan as the second-biggest destination for Chinese gasoline cargoes, behind the regional trading hub Singapore, the GAC data showed.\n\nPakistan was the only destination that recorded steady growth among China's top five gasoline recipients in August, despite overall gasoline exports from China falling sharply by 30.2% on the year to just 7.59 million mt over January-August.\n\nLooking ahead, however, Pakistan's faltering transportation fuel demand due to recent floods in the country may dampen gasoline sales to the South Asian nation in the near-term trading cycles, according to refinery sources and traders based in Beijing, Shandong, and Karachi.\n\nConsumer demand in Pakistan was already under pressure because of surging retail fuel prices. Fuel consumption in September and October is expected to fall by at least one-third year on year, as multiple road links connecting southern Sindh and Balochistan provinces with other key districts have vanished amid floods, halting mobilization of trucks and containers, according to middle distillate distributors and market analysts.\n\nA large section of the road and transport network to Pakistan's financial hub Karachi lies in Sindh, while Balochistan is the country's agricultural hub and a crucial consumer of middle distillates.\n\nPakistan's August domestic gasoline and fuel oil sales fell 13% year on year to 4.8 million barrels and 7% on the year to 2.48 million barrels respectively, with gasoil sales slumping 26% over the same period to 3.75 million barrels, Oil Companies Advisory Council data showed.\n\nThe average monthly consumption in the fourth quarter is also likely to weaken as floods hamper demand from the agricultural sector, said Tahir Abbas, head of research at Arif Habib in Karachi.\n\nTop 5 destinations for China's gasoline, gasoil exports (Unit: '000 mt)\n\nGasoline\n\nAug-22 Jul-22 % Change Aug-21 % Change Singapore 743 623 19.3% 35 2022.8% Malaysia 157 - - 7 2018.9% Pakistan 109 112 -2.4% 74 48.1% Brunei 36 36 -1.4% - - Mexico 36 - - - - Total* 1,117 881 26.8% 568 55.0%\n\nJan-Aug 2022 Jan-Aug 2021 % Change Singapore 2,963 4,664 -36.5% Pakistan 1,667 926 79.9% Philippines 516 1,525 -66.2% Malaysia 407 1,199 -66.1% Indonesia 291 838 -65.2% Total* 7,588 10,878 -30.2%\n\nGasoil\n\nAug-22 Jul-22 % Change Aug-21 % Change Netherlands 257 - - 1 47054.4% Hong Kong 170 109 56.1% 98 74.0% Philippines 82 - - 265 -69.0% Australia 80 - - - - Singapore 70 133 -47.7% 5 1229.9% Total* 829 359 130.7% 544 52.3%\n\nJan-Aug 2022 Jan-Aug 2021 % Change Philippines 582 3,754 -84.5% Singapore 366 2,154 -83.0% Hong Kong 305 1,425 -78.6% Bangladesh 211 1,857 -88.6% Australia 144 2,078 -93.1% Total* 3,260 14,947 -78.2%\n\n*Includes other outlets\n\nSource: General Administration of Customs",

    "Council of Europe slams the Netherlands over mistreatment of asylum seekers": "The Council of Europe has called for the Netherlands to address the failings in its reception of asylum seekers after 700 people were left camping outside a reception center in the town of Ter Apel.\n\nThe council published a letter from Human Rights Commissioner Dunja Mijatovic to Dutch Migration Minister Eric van der Burg on Friday. The letter had been sent on August 26, and was published alongside the Dutch minister's response.\n\n\"The current situation of persons sleeping outside the centre also appears to fall short of even the minimum standards under Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights,\" Mijatovic wrote.\n\nDutch authorities have since moved the migrants and refugees who had been sleeping rough, following a critical report that said the site was a health hazard.\n\nThe charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) also launched the first-ever deployment in the Netherlands after a 3-month-old baby died at the Ter Apel shelter.\n\nWhat did the human rights commissioner say?\n\nMijatovic highlighted a series of concerns in her letter and questioned some of the justifications given by Dutch authorities.\n\n\"I am concerned about the stark differences in the treatment accorded to Ukrainians and to those of other nationalities,\" she wrote, adding that she was calling on the government to \"prevent discriminatory treatment in access to reception and other services.\"\n\nThe human rights commissioner also expressed concerns over \"delays in ensuring safe and dignified conditions\" and the use of short-term facilities \"for some of the most vulnerable persons.\"\n\nShe questioned the proposals put forward by the Netherlands to solve the crisis, including restrictions on family reunifications. \"I stress that any further steps should be fully in line with the Netherlands' obligations under international refugee and human rights law.\"\n\nAmsterdam moves to house asylum seekers on cruise ship\n\nMijatovic also questioned the excuses given by Dutch authorities that led to migrants and refugees left camping outside.\n\n\"I … note that the current situation appears to be less related to a sudden and unforeseen increase in arrivals, but rather exposes some more structural shortcomings,\" she said, pointing to \"excessive downscaling of reception capacities\" as well as a general focus among Council of Europe members on \"reducing arrivals, deterrence and externalization.\"\n\nHow did the Netherlands respond?\n\nIn a letter dated September 1, Van der Burg laid out the measures taken by the Dutch government in response to the situation at Ter Apel.\n\n\"We will open a large emergency shelter (provided by the Ministry of Defence) in a nearby municipality as soon as possible, where people can stay pending the start of their identification and registration procedure at Ter Apel,\" he wrote.\n\nHe also wrote that a budget of €730 million ($730.74 million) has been agreed to set up additional reception centers as well as \"housing for beneficiaries of international protection.\"\n\n\"We need to accelerate the asylum process and provide for a reception system that, while safeguarding human rights, is more responsive to the inevitable fluctuations in asylum applications,\" the minister added regarding long-term measures.\n\nab/wd (dpa, Reuters)",
    "Van Gaal unhappy with Netherlands display but confident for Qatar": "Not good\n\n“I assume that we will do better in possession at the World Cup,” Van Gaal told a news conference. “We were not very good against Belgium although without possession I thought we did well.” He admitted Belgium had the better of the game.\n\n“That had to do with the form of the day and the quality of the opponent. Belgium is the number two in the world rankings for a reason. And it’s unbelievable that we have beaten them twice.” The Netherlands also won 4-1 in Brussels in June, finishing six points clear at the top of their Nations League group.\n\nVan Gaal now heads to a second World Cup, having taken the Dutch to third place in Brazil eight years ago.\n\n“I think we are going to be a difficult opponent to go up against. We showed that if we are out played we can still be difficult to break down by playing more compact,” he said.\n\nMore quality\n\n“I have more quality now in defence and midfield. Only then did we have more exclusive quality in the front with Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben. But with Van Persie injured some of the time, I had a young boy fill in many times then. His name was Memphis Depay.” Depay, along with his Barcelona team mate Frenkie de Jong, did not play against Belgium after going off injured when the Dutch beat Poland 2-0 away on Thursday but Van Gaal said he was keeping a place for both.\n\n“I expect my players to play at a certain level at their club,” he said, adding he had mostly made up his mind about his 26-man squad for Qatar.",
    "Netherlands Has Finally Removed All COVID-19 Travel Restrictions": "As of last Saturday, September 19, the Dutch government has scrapped all remaining Coronavirus entry restrictions, for all incoming travellers, including here those coming from non-European Union countries.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe decision has been announced by the Government of the Netherlands through a statement issued on Friday, SchengenVisaInfo.com reports.\n\n“The Dutch government has decided to lift the EU entry ban for the Netherlands as of September 17 2022. Given the current epidemiological situation in the Netherlands, the government feels that for entry to the Netherlands, the EU entry ban is no longer proportional,” the statement reads.\n\nIt also points out that the removal of the restrictions will be applied to all travellers, including those arriving from countries outside the EU and Schengen area countries.\n\nUp until now, travellers from countries that are not part of the Schengen Area and the EU have been required to present a vaccination or recovery certificate in order to be permitted to enter the territory of the Netherlands.\n\nMoreover, the certificates were subject to several criteria, like the last vaccine dose being taken within the last nine months or the type of the vaccine being amongst the ones approved by the European Medicines Agency or the World Health Organization.\n\nAnnouncing the removal of entry restrictions, the Dutch authorities have also noted that the EU Commission might soon issue a proposal on the revision of COVID-19 entry rules to the Member States.\n\n“The European Commission is also planning to publish a proposal for revising the rules for entering the European Union (EU) in autumn 2022,” the authorities pointed out.\n\nThe Netherlands was amongst the last three EU countries keeping in place COVID-19 entry restrictions, alongside Spain and Luxembourg. However, now that the Netherlands has lifted these restrictions, only the latter two are keeping their restrictions in place.\n\nOnly last weekend, the Spanish authorities have announced that entry restrictions for incoming visitors from non-EU and non-Schengen countries will be extended until November 15.\n\nThe decision has been taken by the Spanish Ministry of Health, and the same has become effective immediately after being published in the Official State Gazette.\n\nThe move means that travellers from non-EU/Schengen countries who are aged 12 and older are required to present a certificate of vaccination, a negative COVID test, or a recovery certificate upon their arrival in order to be permitted to enter the country.\n\nLuxembourg, on the other hand, has a bit tighter entry rules in place, as it permits entry only for those vaccinated against COVID-19. Luxembourg’s entry restrictions will remain in place at least until the end of September, according to an announcement of the country’s Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs made in July this year.\n\nWhether these two countries will remove travel restrictions by the end of the year or earlier remains to be seen. If COVID cases spike up around autumn or later in winter, restrictions, in particular domestic ones, can be introduced Europe-wide.\n\n>> Germany to Impose New Nationwide COVID Rules From October 1",
    "What A Typical Breakfast Looks Like In The Netherlands": "What A Typical Breakfast Looks Like In The Netherlands\n\nEach morning, we leave dreamland behind us, then wake up and resume our daily activities. And one thing to look forward to each morning is the beloved breakfast, which is not called \"the most important meal of the day\" without a good reason. When eaten regularly, breakfast helps with weight management, reduces the risk of heart disease, and improves our energy levels throughout the day (via Better Health). However, Kitchen Infinity says that one in five Americans skip breakfast each day, which is not that bad, but if you're that one person that doesn't eat breakfast, you might need to reconsider your options.\n\nAnd although there are many different breakfast foods around the world, let's zero in on one specific country — the Netherlands. The country of Gouda cheese, great dams, and clogs takes pride in its food, from breakfast to dinner. Evening meals usually start early, around five in the afternoon (via Amsterdam Canal Cruises). The Dutch like to eat veggies, and stews before they go to sleep. But breakfast is quite different, so let's check out what a typical Dutch morning meal looks like.",
    "Nearly entire train network shuts down in Netherlands over strike": "Staff at the railway firm NS stop work in the central Netherlands region that acts as a hub for nearly all train lines.\n\nNearly the entire Dutch rail network has been shut down as workers affected by soaring inflation and staff shortages are on strike to demand better pay and working conditions.\n\nStaff at the railway company Nederlandes Spoorwegen (NS) stopped work for the day on Tuesday in the central Netherlands region that acts as a hub for nearly all train lines, halting trains across the country.\n\nAn exception was the line linking Amsterdam with the busy Schiphol airport that returned to service after a strike shut it down on Monday.\n\nUtrecht Centraal station, the country’s biggest rail hub and normally packed with travellers, was eerily deserted on Tuesday morning.\n\nScreens showing train timetables were lit up with the word “cancelled” in red letters and a station announcer explained in Dutch and English that services were being hit by the strike.\n\nNS said in a statement that international trains operated by Thalys and Eurostar were running again after being halted on Monday.\n\nSchiphol said in a warning to travellers that NS had indicated that four trains an hour would run each way between the airport and the Dutch capital’s central station.\n\nLabour unions have called a series of strikes on the Dutch rail network after negotiations on a new collective labour agreement broke down.",
    "A local’s guide to Rotterdam: secrets of the Netherlands’ second city": "Food\n\nDutch food was once all meat, veg and potatoes, but in the 1950s migrants from all over the world started arriving and created the food culture we now have. A popular tourist market is Markthal with about 100 vendors, including Natamania, which sells delicious Portuguese pastéis de nata.\n\nBut my favourites are the Korean places in the Hoogkwartier area, home also to my restaurant, Coco, which serves food from the Caribbean, Suriname and Cape Verde. Bapboss serves the best spicy kimchi in town: I love its rice – cooking rice is an art – and the excellent galbi (marinated Korean beef rib) is sliced thin for the barbecue. Another must is Ox, a new Malaysian-Chinese pop-up: it’s small, stylish and hidden away (you’re given instructions on how to find it when you book). The menu changes regularly, but I’d eat everything there as the level of cooking – and the cocktails – is very high.\n\nInspiration\n\nOutside the Het Nieuwe Instituut. Photograph: Colin Walton/Alamy\n\nHet Nieuwe Instituut is the Netherlands’ national museum for design and culture, with interactive exhibitions on architecture, dance culture, music and fashion. I also like Mama, a gallery and creative space founded in 1997 on Witte De Withstraat, a buzzy street many tourists enjoy visiting. Mama aims to connect young people to art: it hosts performances, exhibitions and events.\n\nNeighbourhood\n\nI grew up in multicultural West Kruiskade. My parents came over in the 1950s from Cape Verde: back then they put all the migrants in the same neighbourhood. It might have been poor and ugly, but the people that live here have made it rich with their culture, whether from the Dutch colonies or Iran.\n\nWest Kruiskade. Photograph: Zuma Press/Alamy\n\nI especially love the tokos, the little bodegas where you can buy food from the Caribbean, sweet jam, plantain, fake hair, skin creams and shampoos. When I began studying French cuisine it was these tokos that gave me the inspiration to cook differently.\n\nRotterdam’s Chinatown is here, too – my top restaurant tip is Tai Wu, which has been open for 25 years – but there’s so much good food, from Spanish to Turkish. And Wijkpark, the local park, has art and a petting farm.\n\nGreen space\n\nI live in Kralingen now, a more affluent but also studenty area. Its botanic Trompenburg Gardens are known for their biodiversity, with unique trees, shrubs and flowers. A highlight is the desert greenhouse, filled with cacti and succulents. It’s stunning. And, as the gardens are off the beaten track, they’re not often overcrowded, even when the sun is out.\n\nNightlife\n\nI normally go to Baroeg, one of the oldest clubs in Rotterdam, which specialises in metal, punk and rock. Poing has retro arcade games and karaoke, and my favourite cocktail bar is Spikizi, where I always order a Moscow mule. The gay bars here cater mostly for men, but cool queer-friendly clubs include Worm, Tech Noir and Now & Wow in Maassilo, a renovated grain silo built in 1910. Look out for one-off LGBTQ+ events celebrating black ballroom culture. Drag queens and kings perform in many restaurants and other venues across the city.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nMainport (doubles from €115 room-only) is a design hotel on the banks of the River Maas. There is a terrace with views of the Erasmus Bridge and the old harbour, and on another floor there is a swimming pool overlooking the whole city skyline.\n\nThe historic Hotel New York (doubles from €122 room-only) is in the former headquarters of the Holland-America Line, and has a good fish restaurant. I also recommend Bazaar (doubles from €85 B&B) on Witte de Withstraat: its characterful bedrooms are inspired by Asia and Africa.\n\nManuela Gonçalves Tavares is the chef-owner of Coco, which specialises in Caribbean, Surinamese and Cape Verdean cuisine (temporarily closed but reopening soon), and the plant-based Het Nieuwe Café",
    "Vote to join the Netherlands, Dutch satirist urges Russians": "A video by Dutch satirist Arjen Lubach encouraging Russians to vote to become part of the Netherlands has been watched by millions of people – and lots of viewers seem to support the idea.\n\nThe video, prompted by the forthcoming referendums organized by Russia in occupied parts of Ukraine, has also reached a Russian audience – and is circulating on Russian Telegraam groups, the AD said.\n\n‘If he [Putin] can do it, we can do it too,’ Lubach said, introducing the clip on his daily Avondshow.\n\nРеферендум о присоединении России к Нидерландам. Какая хорошая идея! Голосуйте ЗА, дорогие россияне. Пора!pic.twitter.com/X8Rm723CG0 — Olaf Koens (@obk) September 22, 2022\n\nIn the video, Lubach urges Russians to vote to become part of the Netherlands because of the long history between the two countries. ‘Our king Willem IV is your king as well,’ he says. ‘In 1816, Anna Paulowna, the daughter of tzar Paul 1, married Willem II, one of Willem IV’s ancestors.’\n\nPossible names for the new province could include Rusburg, Rustrecht, Gooi-en Russia, East-Holland, Frusia, or Over-Russel,’ the video suggested.\n\nSupport\n\nRussian nationals have been quick to support the initiative on YouTube. ‘As a Russian citizen I would definitely vote “yes” just tell me where to put my signature, time to restore the justice,’ said Viktor.\n\n‘I’m Russian and I vote for Holland,’ said Pekta. ‘When do I get my passport?’\n\nAnother viewer pointed out that there were more links between the two countries than Lubach had mentioned. ‘You forgot to mention that the former capital of the Russian Empire was inspired by Netherlands, even the name Saint Petersburg came from Dutch. We literally have an island named New Holland here!,’ wrote Vera.\n\nLubach first went global with the video, America First, Netherlands Second – an introduction to the Netherlands for Donald Trump when he became president in 2017.",
    "Recreating City of Joy in the Netherlands": "A slice of Kolkata in Europe! That’s how Indians in the Netherlands are going to celebrate Durga Puja.\n\nThis is the sixth year 'Anandadhara', a Bengali club in the north European country, is celebrating Durga Puja. The theme selected for this year is 'Ek tukdo Kolkata'—the depiction of Kolkata and its surroundings. A wooden Howrah Bridge over the Hooghly river, created using lights, along with greenery of the City of Joy would be the main attractions.\n\nNot only Bengalis, but all Indians settled in the country would be part of the grand celebration, the organisers say.\n\nThe celebration is organised at a big ground in Amstelveen. Flowers and banana tree leaves are being flown to the city by air. The idols of Duga and her sons and daughters have already been sent by Kumartuli’s famous idol maker Prashanta Paul.\n\n“The finishing touch for the celebration is going on. We, mostly IT job holders, will be on leave for five days during Durga Puja and are going to engage ourselves totally in the grand celebration,” said Sudipta Laskar, an IT professional and one of the organisers.\n\nLaskar hails from Hooghly, a neighbouring district of Kolkata. The river Hooghly flows through most part of his district.\n\nPreparations on for the five-day Durga Puja celebrations\n\nThere will be cultural programmes in the evening of each day of Durga Puja. “The highlight of this year's cultural performances is Rabindra Nath Tagore's dance-drama Chitrangada, which will be performed by our in-house dance troupe Ananda Taranga,” said Laskar.\n\nDipwanita Mukherjee, who is in-charge of the show, also shared her excitement. \"Our troupe performing in front of over 500 audiences makes me both nervous and excited. We do rehearsals every alternate day despite our busy schedule with family and office. During Durga Puja, we are endowed with additional energy to make it all happen. Looking forward to the D-day,\" she said.\n\nOther performances include classical dances like Kathak, Odissi and Bharatanatyam by professional dancers, besides folk and cinematic dances. Musical shows, including vocals and instrument recitals, as well as recitation of Bengali poems have also been included.\n\nVarious games and contests have also been arranged targeting the youth. There will also be a contest to find out the best dressed couple—Shriman-Srimati—which was a hit last time, say the organisers.\n\nVarious cultural programmes are being organised as part the celebrations\n\nCovid-19 will have nominal impact this time with almost all restrictions being lifted. “Nevertheless, we have ensured that there will be no overcrowding and safe distance can be maintained,” says Nabanita Sarkar, who hails from Asansol.\n\n\"But yes, finally we don't have to wear masks with our saris! Covid has lost its importance as it has become just a glorified 'cold',” she says.\n\nSujit Mandol, who hails from Durgapur, is the theme artist this year.

    "Hundreds of people in the Netherlands protest the Iranian government, Mahsa Amini death": "Hundreds of people in the Netherlands demonstrated on Saturday against the Iranian government and for women's rights in Iran. They protested in solidarity with the demonstrators in Iran who have taken to the streets to express their anger at the death of Mahsa Amini.\n\nThe 22-year-old Iranian Kurdish woman died after being arrested by the religious police. She had not covered her head according to Iran's rules and thereby violated the dress code in the strict Islamic country.\n\nIn Rotterdam a protest on the Stationsplein was organized by Kurdish parties. About 200 people attended, said Farshad Moradian, one of the organizers.\n\n\"The protest went well. We want to stand up for the Kurdish people in Iran right now.\" A number of women \"spontaneously set fire to their headscarves out of solidarity.\" According to the police, that was not the intention, \"that's why we asked [the protesters] not to do this anymore,\" Moradian said.\n\nDozens of Iranian-Dutch activists at the Tweede Kamer in The Hague felt that the Netherlands should condemn the violence in Iran and the death of Amini. \"We want tough measures against the Iranian regime. The Dutch government, together with the European Union, must stand behind the Iranian demonstrators,\" said Shahin Sultany Taied of the Association of Iranian Academics, one of the initiators of the demonstration in The Hague.\n\nJong Iraans Nederland chairman Sepiedeh Orafa said in The Hague that Amini's death has been a catalyst, but \"the current protests are broader than just her murder.\"\n\n\"People have wanted to get away from this regime for a long time.\" Banners at the demonstrations displayed texts such as \"Death to Khamenei\" and \"Death to the oppressor.\" They refer to Iran's supreme spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Hosseini Khamenei, who has represented the highest authority in the country for over 30 years.\n\nSultany Taied believes it is possible to change the regime this time as long as demonstrations continue. \"People are willing to sacrifice their lives for freedom right now,\" Taied said.\n\nMore than 700 people who had taken part in the protests were arrested on Saturday in northern Iran, including 60 women, according to state media. According to these outlets, at least 35 people died in the demonstrations. Human rights groups believe the real number of deaths is higher.\n\nThe demonstrators in The Hague want to campaign until Thursday to show their solidarity. They will then go to the Iranian embassy.",

Dick Zandee and Renze de Keiser assess which consequences the Madrid Summit may have for the Netherlands in terms of adapting its armed forces as well as for implementing its ‘and-and’ policy of investing in NATO and the EU for ensuring Europe’s security.\n\nAt the end of June this year, NATO showed its best face at the Madrid Summit: the image of unity and resolve in response to the Russian invasion and ongoing war in Ukraine. In response to the most critical security crisis in Europe since the end of the Cold War, a new Strategic Concept was agreed upon. Naturally, most initial comments focused on the language used towards Russia and China as well as on the issue of Swedish and Finnish NATO membership. This article analyzes the impact of the Madrid Summit on the Alliance’s deterrence and defense posture, but also on the challenges posed by hybrid threats.

    "Looming drinking water shortage a threat to the Netherlands, suppliers say": "Water companies in the Netherlands said that a combination of drought, pollution, and the growing population is a threat to the supply of clean, potable water in the country, they said in a letter. A shortage of drinking water could be just a few years away, the companies said according to NRC.\n\n“The water system is reaching its limits due to drought, salinity and increasing water demand due to a growing population and economy. The availability of water for the drinking water supply is under pressure,” the letter stated. “In addition, the quality of drinking water sources is deteriorating due to pollution of agriculture, industry and households. Future generations risk being saddled with a less secure supply of reliable drinking water.”\n\nDrought has become more frequent, the economy is growing, and water needs have increased quickly over the last ten years, they said. The demand will water will continue to grow, particularly as the Dutch population will grow by an estimated 1.5 million people within the next 20 years. Groundwater and surface water sites are also endangered, with increasing salivation and the high amount of pollution from the agriculture and industrial sectors.\n\nThree of the companies are under immediate pressure to fulfill their mandate to supply clean, potable water. Those companies are Dunea, Vitens, and Waterbedrijf Groningen, according to NRC. The newspaper examined an internal document from Verwin, the association of water companies, to draw this conclusion.\n\nAll ten of the Dutch water companies may no longer be able to meet their obligations about water provision by 2030 if the current infrastructure is not scaled up further. This means collecting more water, increasing purification capacity, and investing in more distribution systems. “Everyone takes it for granted that water just comes out the tap. That is not true. That’s worrying,” said Peter van der Velden, the chair of Verwin, in an interview with NRC.\n\nThe water companies also fear they will not be able to supply water to all 900,000 new homes that the Cabinet wants built in the next seven years. As such, they think water access and soil should be the priority when considering spatial planning in the Netherlands.\n\nThe companies proposed several solutions to the problem, such as removing the red tape around granting permission for water extraction, speeding up the development of new extraction sites, and converting seawater into drinking water. The government’s limitation on letting the utility companies earn a profit has also had the effect of limiting their ability to invest in the supply chain issues and new innovations, they claimed.\n\nFurther, they also recommend making it easier, or even mandatory, for households to collect their own rainwater and recycle their own wasted drinking water. Water conservation campaigns could also slow household water usage.",

The officials also will explore best practices in urban mobility, climate action and sustainability, and technology and science innovation, center officials said.\n\n“San Diego is an undeniable force in the global marketplace, and we must seize opportunities to tell our story and maximize investment from partners around the world,” Gloria said in a statement.\n\nHome to Europe’s largest port and fourth-busiest cargo airport, the Netherlands is a hub for global trade and business.\n\nYet it has connections that reach all the way to San Diego. For instance, the Netherlands is among the top 10 countries for foreign direct investment into the region (No. 6 in 2015-2020).\n\nNetherlands-based companies also directly employ 5,000 San Diegans, predominately in the innovation economy at companies like ASML and Philips.\n\nBy deal count, the Netherlands is ninth among those injecting venture capital into San Diego, in line with Denmark and falling closely behind Japan, France and India.\n\nDutch firms invested nearly $318 million in San Diego’s economy in 2021.\n\nThe mission is organized by the trade center, an affiliate of the San Diego Regional Economic Development Corp., with assistance and support provided by the U.S. Embassy in The Hague, the Consulate of the Netherlands.\n\nCompanies acting as sponsors include ASML, Lufthansa and Qualcomm.\n\nNikia Clarke, executive director of the trade center and a senior vice president at the EDC said that “it is increasingly important for metro leaders to advance a compelling vision that keeps us ahead of the curve.”\n\nThe mission will take the delegation to Amsterdam, The Hague, Rotterdam, Eindhoven and Leiden. Sessions with Dutch companies and institutions include:\n\nThe grand opening of Qualcomm’s AI Research Lab, which has formalized a partnership with the University of Amsterdam to support a pipeline of engineering talent.\n\nA meeting and tour of ASML – a leader in semiconductor manufacturing machines – at its Veldhoven headquarters to celebrate the 10th anniversary of its investment in its San Diego-based Cymer site.\n\nA pitch by local, minority-owned small businesses Trabus Technologies and Nano PharmaSolutions to the Port of Rotterdam and Leiden University Medical Center.\n\nMeetings between Gloria and the mayors of Amsterdam and Rotterdam.\n\nMeetings and tours of several companies considering investment in San Diego and California, led by Gloria.\n\nThe two dozen San Diego delegates include representatives from Qualcomm, ASML, Mitsubishi Electric, Trabus Technologies, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc., Gafcon, Arup, HomeFed Corporation, Townshend Venture Advisors and more.\n\nThe mission also includes delegates from key San Diego agencies, universities and civic organizations such as the Port of San Diego, UC San Diego, San Diego State University, San Diego Association of Governments, San Diego County Regional Airport Authority and more.\n\n“This trip is one example of how we can work together across borders to remain competitive in a global economy,” said Consul General Dirk Janssen, Consulate of the Netherlands in San Francisco.",

    "Netherlands lags on raising awareness of single use plastics ban": "The Netherlands has not got to grips with EU legislation banning forms of single use plastic, according to a report by environmental campaigners.\n\nThree organisations, Seas at Risk, Surfrider Europe and Zero Waste Europe, have published a report summing up progress across the EU to implement the single-use plastics directive.\n\nThe directive bans certain plastic items which are used and thrown away, and which have readily-available alternatives that are less damaging to the environment. It includes straws, cotton bud sticks, wet wipes and food containers, and aims to reduce pollution on European beaches and waters.\n\nAlthough the ruling came into force on January 1 2022, the report says that some countries are ‘laggards’ in introducing local legislation, others are ‘unambitious’ and some have ‘adopted damaging measures or exemptions.’\n\nRed mark\n\nThe report praises the approach in countries such as France, Luxembourg, Sweden and Ireland. Although the Netherlands scores well on bans, product marking and separate collection points, it gets a red mark for not reducing consumption of single use plastics.\n\nOverall, the country’s adoption of the measures is ‘underway or incomplete’, according to the report – lagging well behind neighbouring France.\n\n‘Countries such the Netherlands tend to focus their awareness raising efforts on influencing consumer behaviour towards less littering, which constitutes quite a conservative approach to awareness-raising on SUP [single use plastics], since users at large should be targeted, including public administrations and small and large businesses,’ the report notes.\n\nCigarettes\n\nAlthough it labels the country one of the ‘laggards’ on overall awareness, it praises campaigns such as an annual cigarette butt pick up. Cigarette butts also contain plastic, and some MPs and green campaigners in the Netherlands have been advocating a ban.\n\nMeanwhile, a deposit scheme for small plastic bottles, introduced this year, is thought to have increased recycling by around 80%.\n\nBut Marijke Boonstra, project leader on clean seas at Stichting De Noordzee, who contributed to the report, told Dutch News there was more to be done: ‘If the Netherlands is serious about tackling problem of plastic pollution, it should show more ambition,’ she said. ‘The Netherlands should set targets for reuse, expand deposit systems for all beverage packaging and impose more bans on unnecessary single-use plastics.’\n\nLarissa Copello, a campaigner at Zero Waste Europe, said in a press release that more can also be done across the EU to ensure polluters pay: ‘Correct implementation is crucial to realise the “polluter pays” principle, guaranteeing that producers bear 100% of the clean-up costs for littered single-use plastic items.’",
    "‘It definitely isn’t flat’: Netherlands mountain trail proves an unlikely success": "The Netherlands, so the guidebook notes, has been “popularised as a flat land full of cheese and clogs”.\n\nEnthusiasts behind the Dutch Mountain Trail, a 63-mile (101km) hike across seven glorious peaks – two of which are made from the spoil of old mines – merely ask, only a little tongue in cheek, that the world stops being so narrow minded.\n\nEmerging from a local branch of an annual festival celebrating mountain films and culture across the globe, the “alpine” walk in the lowlands was first thought up in 2020 as the climate consequences of travel became ever-clearer and Covid made it difficult to get to the more traditional European summits.\n\n“That means not flying all over the world to chase your big mountains but also to look in your backyard,” said Toon Hezemans, 60, one of the creators of the trail in South Limburg, the southernmost region of the Netherlands, jutting into Belgium and Germany.\n\nA route was devised and word of mouth did the rest. It was an immediate success. An estimated 17,000 Dutch and German copies of a guide to the hike have been sold so far. This November, an English-language version will be published.\n\nAs to the potential issue of the lack of actual mountains in Europe’s flattest country, Hezemans, an artist by profession, questioned the very definition. “That’s a very interesting one,” he said, mentioning a Hugh Grant comedy, The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill, But Came Down a Mountain.\n\nIn the movie, Welsh villagers are furious when English cartographers declare that their “mountain” is in fact a hill as it doesn’t meet the 1,000ft (305 metres) threshold. The locals build a mound on top of the summit to cheat the system.\n\nThe Dutch Mountain Trail in south Limburg. Photograph: Judith Jockel/The Observer\n\nFor Hezemans and Andrew Davies, 65, his conspirator and the translator of the guidebook into English, that is not what a mountain is about. “I don’t think you ought to take 1,000ft as a definition because the word in Dutch is berg, which has a slightly different definition,” said Davies, who moved to the Netherlands from Manchester 38 years ago.\n\n“It depends on the surrounding,” insisted Hezemans, while overlooking the scenic valleys from a bench on the Eyserberg, a peak about 200 metres above sea level. “This one in the Himalayas won’t be a mountain. But you can see the church steeple of the Vijlen, they call themselves the only mountain village of the Netherlands, and they actually have a football team who recently played in the international mountain village football championship.”\n\nWith alpine people it is, he said, a matter of shared perspectives. A mountain is in the eye of the beholder.\n\n“OK,” he added, walking on, “maybe there aren’t mountains here but it definitely isn’t flat.”\n\nSouth Limburg is the country’s most elevated region, with deep(ish) valleys carved out by fast-flowing rivers and streams, and the trail criss-crosses the borders with Belgium and Germany. You are never more than six miles from an international border.\n\nThe walk, which Hezemans insisted can actually be arduous at points, starts at Eygelshoven railway station, near the town of Kerkrade, with the first goal being to reach the top of Wilhelminaberg, about 225 metres above sea level, a former spoil heap of the Wilhelmina coalmine, which was operational between 1906 and 1969.\n\nAfter that, the walker heads to the foothills of Schneeberg, whose highest point is over the border in Germany and literally translates as “snow mountain”. Its place in the Dutch Mountain Trail is, Hezemans admitted, a bit of cheat.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This has a very nice meadow and alpine flowers blooming there.”\n\nNext up is Gulperberg (155 metres above sea level): “That’s really a mountain, with a statue of Mother Mary on top, looking over the town of Gulpen – maybe the most mountainous mountain, with a cone shape.” Then it is Hakkenberg (a little over 200 metres above sea level), where “the half-timbered houses in the valley make the ‘mountain experience’ complete”, according to the walk’s guide. This peak did not have a name until Hezemans named it after a path to its top.\n\nThe Dutch mountain trail is being pushed as an alternative holiday experience to Amsterdam. Photograph: Judith Jockel/The Guardian\n\nThe trail then crosses into Belgium, where, during the first world war, the border was marked by a 206-mile high-voltage fence, from Vaals to the North Sea coast, known as the “wire of death”. The sixth peak is Voerstreek, which in the 1970s was the scene of clashes between French- and Dutch-speakers over the area’s language.\n\n“Tourism saved the area, as at some point they realised the battles weren’t helping attract tourists,” said Hezemans.\n\nThe trail’s final summit is D’n Observant in Maastricht, a manmade spoil heap from the upper layers of Sint Pietersberg, which over the centuries was extensively quarried for its marlstone.\n\nHezemans admitted to being a bit bemused when prospective walkers writing on a dedicated Facebook page ask whether they should bring ropes or wonder whether they should risk an outbreak of vertigo. “That I don’t get,” he laughed.\n\nPassing by on her third day of the walk, Esther Ruijtenbeek, 46, a textile designer, was just over 30 miles into the trail and said she had two blisters overnight and the heat was proving a challenge. But a Dutch mountain trail? “I am a little sceptical perhaps,” she laughed. “It is good preparation for mountain hiking.”",
    "PM: Malaysia keen to learn flood management from Netherlands": "NEW YORK: Malaysia wants to tap the Netherlands’ experience in flood management to see if it can be applied to mitigate floods in Malaysia, says the Prime Minister.\n\nDatuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob said the Dutch had long been considered experts in this field and Malaysia could learn from the former’s experience.\n\nHe said this was among the issues he discussed with his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte during their meeting on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly.\n\n“We hope to gain advice from them so that we can minimise the effects of floods,” he told the Malaysian media.\n\nDue to its low elevation – about two thirds of its area is vulnerable to flooding – thus flood control is crucial in the Netherlands.\n\nIsmail Sabri said Malaysia and the Netherlands had agreed to boost trade relations between both countries, pointing out the latter was the biggest palm oil importer in Europe.\n\nOn the issue of MH17, the Prime Minister had informed Rutte that Malaysia’s next move would be made known after the trial in a Dutch court reached its verdict in November.\n\nHe said Malaysia did not want to “jump the gun” and make known its next course before the verdict.\n\n“There have been attempts by certain countries, including the Netherlands and Australia, to rope in Malaysia to accuse Russia for its involvement in the case,” he said.\n\nAccording to reports, verdicts in the Dutch trial in absentia of three Russians and a Ukrainian charged with involvement in the downing of MH17 are expected to be delivered on Nov 17.\n\nThe trial started on March 9, 2020, and an international team of investigators and prosecutors named four suspects – Russians Igor Girkin, Sergey Dubinskiy and Oleg Pulatov as well as Ukrainian Leonid Kharchenko.\n\nThey are charged with murdering all who had died in the tragedy.\n\nMH17 was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it was shot down by a missile fired from territory held by pro-Russian rebels during fighting with Ukrainian government troops, international investigators said.\n\nAll 298 people on board were killed in the July 17, 2014 incident, two-thirds of them Dutch nationals.",

    "Not easy being green: Rutte’s eco-friendly agenda falters amid Dutch farmer backlash": "Former Dutch Agriculture Minister Henk Staghouwer at a dairy farm in Warder, the Netherlands, on August 11, 2022 | Remko de Waal/EPA-EFE\n\nThe Dutch government is losing the battle to reduce its agricultural emissions, highlighting just how hard it is to square its green ambitions with their potential economic impacts.\n\nOn Monday, the country's Agriculture Minister Henk Staghouwer resigned just hours after agreeing with the European Commission to end an EU exemption that enabled Dutch farmers to continue spreading more manure on their fields than other EU countries.\n\nThe end of this derogation comes as Mark Rutte's government tries to push through its wider plan for reducing emissions of nitrogen, which evaporates from manure. Excessive nitrogen emissions can hurt the environment and pollute waterways, but farmers fear the measures, which will reduce the amount of fertilizer they can use, will destroy their livelihoods.\n\nStaghouwer said he was not the “right person” to lead the “transition to circular agriculture.” Rutte called his decision to step down \"brave\" and wished Staghouwer \"every success in the future.\"\n\nCarola Schouten, the deputy prime minister and fellow member of Staghouwer's Christian Union party, will take over the agriculture post for now. But the farmers, who know Schouten from her stint as agriculture minister under the previous government, said they don't expect any more progress.\n\n\"[Schouten] is invisible. She doesn't have any plans. She doesn’t have any vision,” said Sieta van Keimpema from the Farmers Defense Force, one of the most vocal groups in the farmer protests.\n\nDutch agriculture was once hailed as a model for farming, with National Geographic in 2017 dubbing the Netherlands the “tiny country that feeds the world.” It's the world's second-largest exporter of agricultural goods, a massive meat producer and renowned for its use of high-tech methods to bolster yields.\n\nBut its courts decided that productivity should not come at the cost of the environment. In 2019, the Council of State, the Netherlands' highest administrative court, ruled that farming activities and construction permits violated the country's own emissions law.\n\n“We’ve known about the [pollution] for at least 10 years, but because the government kept ignoring the issue, it suddenly found itself backed into a corner without a clear idea of how to resolve it,” said Jeroen Candel, an agricultural policy professor at Wageningen University in the Netherlands.\n\nThe new government promised to change that, even appointing a minister for \"nature and nitrogen policy\" to implement the reductions.\n\nBut it has struggled to match policy with its ambitions. The government's plans have sparked protests from farmers since they were presented in June, with demonstrations only growing bigger.\n\nWith the steep targets for cutting emissions — up to 95 percent in some areas — Dutch farmers feel they will be out of a job if the measures go through, with van Keimpema previously accusing the government of trying to \"wipe us off the map.\"\n\nEfforts by a government-appointed negotiator to come to an agreement have so far failed, with Staghouwer ultimately being pushed to the sidelines of the talks, according to Dutch media and Candel.\n\nFarmers' organizations called for a new minister to be appointed “quickly,” at a time when steep fertilizer and gas prices are already putting a squeeze on global food production.\n\nCandel said the standoff could become a full-fledged crisis if the government fails to resolve it. “I wouldn’t be surprised if the coalition collapsed over this,” he said.\n\nLouise Guillot contributed reporting.",
    "Netherlands' house prices dropped slightly in August": "Dutch home prices fell very slightly in August, according to Statistics Netherlands (CBS). Homebuyers paid on average 0.1 percent less for an existing home than in July. CBS economist Peter Hein van Mulligen called it a trend break.\n\nCompared to a year ago, owner-occupied homes were still significantly more expensive, but the price increase was much smaller than a few months ago. At the start of this year, the stats office reported the strongest increase in decades, with a plus of about 21 percent. Prices are now only 11.9 percent higher than the same month last year.\n\nCBS’s price index is often slightly lower in a particular month than the previous month, but this is usually in December. The last time the stats office noticed a slight price drop in another month was in February 2019.\n\nAccording to experts, there have been several signs recently that the housing market is finally cooling off after a period of significant price increases. “You can’t draw too many conclusions from one month,” Van Mulligen nuanced. But he also pointed out that the monthly increases in house prices in July and June were already minimal.\n\nAccording to the economist, this is probably due to the increased mortgage rate resulting in many people being able to borrow less. Van Mulligen also said that consumer confidence had fallen quite hard recently. People generally don’t think it is a good time for major purchases - like buying a house - at the moment.\n\nThe latter may also explain why the number of relocations is lower than a year ago. The Land Registry registered 16,405 housing transactions last month. That is almost 5 percent less than a year earlier. People generally want to sell their house before buying a new one, the realtors’ agency NVB noted not so long ago.\n\nIt remains to be seen what the future of house prices will do. Rabobank economists recently said that house prices could fall to a limited extent in the course of next year. Though the bank still expected house prices to rise this year and next, viewed over an entire year. The housing market is also still tight. So sellers still quickly find a buyer, Rabobank said.",

This series takes a deep dive into the stories, cultures and traditions found throughout Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany]\n\nUSAG BENELUX - BRUNSSUM, Netherlands – Prince’s Day, or as the Dutch say, “Prinsjesdag,” is held annually on the third Tuesday of September.\n\nWhile not an official holiday, many Dutch citizens still consider it an important cultural and political occasion. The day (also known as Budget Day) marks the beginning of a new parliamentary year, as well as when the government announces its budget plans and anticipated revenue and expenditures for the upcoming fiscal year.\n\nThe Name\n\nOriginally, Prince’s Day celebrated the birthday of Prince Willem V. In the 18th century, during the French occupation, Prince’s Day was one of the most popular folk festivals since it allowed supporters of the Dutch monarchy to keep expressing their loyalty towards the Royal House of Orange-Nassau.\n\nSince 1814, Prince’s Day has been used to designate the first official day of Parliament. There is no historical context or official government documentation explaining why the name “Prinsjesdag” was given to the day Parliament opens.\n\nThe Third Tuesday of September\n\nThe modern Prince’s Day was first held on the first Monday of November, and then later on the third Monday of October.\n\nHowever, that was still too short a time frame to have the national budget ready before Jan. 1, so in 1848 Prince’s Day changed to the third Monday of September.\n\nMany parliament members disagreed with holding it on a Monday, since it meant those living outside The Hague would have to travel on a Sunday. Christian politicians greatly opposed Sunday travel as it is considered a sabbatical day.\n\nDue to the backlash, since 1887, Budget Day has been held on the third Tuesday of September.\n\nRoyal Procession\n\nThe Prince’s Day ceremonies begin with the Royal Procession, where King Willem-Alexander and Queen Máxima depart Palace Noordeinde (one of the three official palaces of the Dutch Royal House) in the Glass Coach along with Crown Princess Catharina-Amalia.\n\nThe procession usually ends at the Hall of Knights at The Hague, however this year it will end at the Royal Theater due to ongoing construction in the area.\n\nThe Royal Procession is one of the most publicly visible portions of Prince’s Day, with spectators lining up along the route in order to watch the parade.\n\nBesides members of the Royal House, the procession includes officers of the Royal Household, mounted police, a band and various army units.\n\nThe procession is usually led by the Johan Willem Friso Royal Military Band, with military personnel from the cavalry, the Grenadiers and Hunters regiment and the Royal Marechaussee (Dutch: Koninklijke Marechaussee, or KMar) forming a mounted honorary escort.\n\nMusic can be heard throughout the procession, as various military bands and musicians are placed along the route.\n\nHundreds of military personnel from all branches of the Dutch armed forces also line the entire parade route, and salute as the Glass Coach and the king pass by.\n\nSpeech from the Throne and Budget\n\nOnce the procession arrives at the theater, the king and queen meet with their ministers, state secretaries, members of parliament and distinguished guests.\n\nThe king then opens the new parliamentary year by reading the Speech from the Throne. The speech covers the current status of the country and presents the government's program for the coming year.\n\nFollowing the speech, the Prime Minister carries the ceremonial briefcase to the Dutch House of Representatives in order to begin budget deliberations. This briefcase contains the proposed National Budget and Budget Memorandum for the upcoming year.\n\nIn the Budget Memorandum, the government outlines its financial plans and specifies the coming year’s anticipated revenue and expenditures.\n\nRevenue in the Netherlands mainly comes from taxes and social insurance contributions, and other sources such as the sale of natural gas.\n\nOn the expenditure side, the government documents how much it plans to spend on programs such as education, social security, health care and security. Additionally, it discusses the national and international economic situation and gives an indication of the Dutch financial situation.\n\nMilitary Link\n\nOn royal occasions and national events, the Dutch military plays an important ceremonial role.\n\nUnits of the navy, army, air force and KMar perform a variety of tasks, acting as a visual ‘business card’ for the Netherlands.\n\nThis close connection between the armed forces and the royal house can be seen during major events such as royal funerals, coronations, the National Remembrance Day and Prince’s Day.\n\nA unique ritual on Prince’s Day is the gun salute by the Corps of Riding Artillery, also known as “Yellow Riders” (Dutch: “Gele Rijders”). Starting with the departure of the Royal Procession from Palace Noordeinde, and continuing during the route back following the king‘s speech, the artillerymen fire a shot every minute.\n\nHat parade\n\nAnother highlight of Prince’s Day for the general public is the “hat parade.”\n\nA fairly recent tradition, since 1977 female attendees of the Speech from the Throne have worn conspicuous hats in order to stand out, serve as tribute to the queen, or even to make political statements.\n\nAccording to some Dutch media outlets, the size of the women's hats represents the Dutch economic situation that year.\n\n—\n\nThis series, Bits of the Benelux, will continue to explore the many cultural traditions in and around the Benelux. Further stories like this on the local traditions, festivals, and events are scheduled to be published monthly, as they occur.\n\nAdditional Resources"
