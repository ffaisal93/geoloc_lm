    "Turkey Signals Possible Rapprochement With Syria": "Recently there have been signs of reconciliation between Turkey and Syria, which have been at odds for more than a decade as Ankara supported Syrian rebel forces fighting Damascus.\n\nPro-government daily Hurriyet reported September 16 that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had expressed a wish to meet his Syrian counterpart, Bashar al-Assad, at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Summit in Uzbekistan, although Assad was not there.\n\n\"I wish Assad had come to Uzbekistan; I would have spoken to him,\" Erdogan said in a closed meeting of his ruling Justice and Development Party, according to Hurriyet columnist Abdulkadir Selvi.\n\nAlso, last month, Erdogan reportedly said he would never rule out dialogue with Syria, adding that \"we should take further steps with Syria.\"\n\nReuters reported September 15 that Hakan Fidan, head of Turkey’s National Intelligence Organization, had met multiple times with his counterpart, Syrian National Security Bureau Chairman Ali Mamlouk, in Damascus in recent weeks, according to four sources.\n\n‘Change in rhetoric’\n\nGonul Tol, the director of the Middle East Institute's Center for Turkish Studies, told VOA these developments are not new, as Turkey has been working closely with the Assad regime since 2016.\n\n\"I think the new thing that we're seeing right now is the change in rhetoric. We are hearing from Turkish officials more vocally that normalization with the regime is a possibility,\" Tol said during an interview via phone in response to questions about Erdogan’s recent statement regarding relations with Syria.\n\n\"But, in reality, if you look at all the developments that have been happening since 2016, I don't think this is shocking.\"\n\nTol said that since Erdogan started aligning his party with the nationalists to consolidate power, his top priority has shifted from toppling the Assad regime to curbing Kurdish advances in northern Syria.\n\n\"To realize that goal, he needed not only a Russian green light but also he had to work closely with the regime itself. … So, there was a tacit understanding between the two—while Erdogan attacks the Kurds, Assad looks the other way,\" Tol said.\n\nTurkey has conducted four military operations in Syria since 2016, and it considers the armed Kurdish YPG militia, a key part of the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces in northern Syria to be a national security threat.\n\nAnkara views the Syrian Democratic Forces to be a Syrian offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, which both Turkey and the United States have designated a terrorist organization.\n\nNATO member Turkey has a military presence in large swaths of northern Syria. Damascus considers Turkey an occupying power and calls for its unconditional withdrawal from Syria.\n\nMilitary incursion\n\nErdogan announced plans in June to launch a new military incursion in northern Syria, targeting the Tal Rifaat and Manbij areas to form a safe zone along the Syrian border. But that has not happened yet.\n\nRussian and pro-Syrian government forces have a presence in these areas, and Russia has not endorsed Turkey's operation.\n\n\n\nAron Lund, a fellow at Century International and Middle East analyst at the Swedish Defense Research Agency, thinks that Erdogan saw an opportunity for a new military operation while the U.S. and Russia mostly focused on Ukraine.\n\nLund notes that Ankara does not need to ask for Washington’s green light as the United States is not involved with the SDF forces in the area where Turkey is eyeing an operation.\n\n\"Erdogan felt that Russia has weakened and is under more international pressure, so they won't be able to bring the same level of push back in Syria. So, this is basically a good moment to go after the Syrian Democratic Forces because the United States and the Europeans will offer more muted criticism than they would normally do and the Russians will be more open to negotiating at Assad's expense,\" Lund told VOA in a conversation.\n\n\"But Russia successfully parried that and drew Erdogan into a negotiation process where the counter demand is that he must talk to Assad, or not Assad personally perhaps, but some form of normalization of their relationship,\" Lund added.\n\nRussian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov said last Monday that Moscow is willing to organize a meeting between Syrian Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad and Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu.\n\n\"We think that [a foreign minister-level meeting] would be useful. We are talking about establishing contacts, now so far through the military and intelligence services — there have been such contacts,\" Bogdanov said, responding to a question on the possibility of such a meeting.\n\nOn the other hand, Mekdad told Sputnik on Saturday that there was no contact or meeting with the Turkish officials during the UNGA. “There is no negotiation, no contact, at least nothing at the level of foreign ministers,\" Mekdad said.\n\nMekdad also accused Turkey of not fulfilling the agreed commitments in the Astana process without elaborating on them. Erdogan, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, and Russian President Vladimir Putin came together in Tehran for Astana talks in July.\n\n\"The only obstacle to the peace process is Turkey's lack of commitment,” Mekdad told Sputnik on the sidelines of the UNGA.\n\nRefugees’ return\n\nTurkey's pro-government daily, Sabah, reported on September 17 that Syrian and Turkish intelligence officials discussed several issues, including the completion of Syria’s new constitution process, revoking its expropriation law that allowed Syria’s government to confiscate property left behind by refugees, and the safe return of those refugees from Syria. Turkey hosts 3.7 million Syrian refugees, the largest refugee population in the world.”\n\nTurkey’s state-run Disaster and Emergency Management Authority announced that over 68,000 briquette houses have been built in Syria for the return of the refugees.\n\nInternational rights groups, including Amnesty International, say war-torn Syria is still not safe for return.\n\nAaron Stein, a Turkey expert and the chief content officer at Metamorphic Media, says that the parameters of Turkish foreign policy on Syria have not changed since 2016, but what has changed is that domestic political dynamics in Turkey have gotten so bad for Erdogan’s party.\n\nStein cited rising anti-Syrian refugee sentiment in Turkey and the country’s economic crisis, with an official inflation last month of 80.2%.\n\n\n\nThe next presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next June, but the opposition parties are calling for snap elections, which Erdogan has dismissed. The six-opposition-party alliance against Erdogan has promised to return Syrian refugees humanely. On the other hand, the far-right Victory Party calls for forced deportations of Syrian refugees, blaming them for the rising food prices.\n\n\"No Turkish person cares about Bashar al-Assad. What people care about in Turkey is the cost of living is going up, and that food prices are out of control and wages are remaining stagnant,\" Stein told VOA.\n\nStein said he does not expect any real progress on Turkey and Syria rapprochement and added, \"I think the value for Erdogan now is that he can tell constituents he is working on a problem.\"\n\nThis story originated in VOA's Turkish Service.",

    "Turkey files protest with Greece, US in islands row": "Turkey on Monday summoned the Greek ambassador and sent a protest note to Washington over Greece's alleged deployment of US armoured vehicles on two Aegean islands near the Turkish coast.\n\nThe Turkish foreign ministry told the Greek envoy that Athens should “stop violations” and respect the non-military status the islands were assigned by international law, the Anadolu state news agency reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a note to the US embassy in Ankara, Turkey told Washington that its “weapons should not be used in breach” of the islands' agreed status, Anadolu said.\n\nFor the latest headlines, follow our Google News channel online or via the app.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan separately accused Greece of staging “provocations” and playing “perilous games”.\n\n“Greece cannot be our interlocutor, either politically, militarily, or economically,” Erdogan said in a national address.\n\nGreece and Turkey, which are both part of the US-led NATO defence alliance, have feuded for years over maritime borders and energy exploration rights in the Aegean and east Mediterranean seas.\n\nThe latest escalation started when Turkish security sources shared aerial images over the weekend purportedly showing ships loaded with US armoured vehicles docking at two Greek islands, Lesbos and Samos.\n\nErdogan has repeatedly accused Greece of “occupying” the Aegean islands, whose status was settled in treaties adopted after World War I.\n\nIn response, Athens accuses Turkey of conducting hundreds of illegal military sorties over the islands.\n\nGreece filed a formal complaint with the European Union, NATO and the United Nations after Erdogan hinted at a possible military operation in the Aegean earlier this month.\n\nErdogan continued his war of words on Monday, saying Greece was not Turkey's equal and rejecting diplomatic talks.\n\nHe also vowed to defend Turkey's interests with “any means at its disposal” in the islands row.\n\nRead more:\n\nErdogan warns Greece over Aegean airspace violations\n\nEU voices concern over Turkey's ‘hostile remarks’ against Greece\n\nUS calls Erdogan threats to Greece ‘unhelpful’",
    "‘Hostile narrative’: Turkey slams Greek PM’s UN remarks": "Ankara accuses Athens of distorting facts after Greek PM says Turkey is undermining regional peace and stability.\n\nTurkey has condemned remarks by Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis who accused Ankara of undermining peace and stability in the Eastern Mediterranean region and playing a “destabilising role”.\n\nLong-existing tensions between the two countries have flared up recently. Greece complained to NATO and the United Nations this month over what it called “inflammatory” rhetoric.\n\n“Unfortunately this statement [by Mitsotakis] was yet another example of distortion of facts and hostile narrative against Turkiye. Turkiye’s role in its region and beyond is well appreciated by the international community,” the Turkish delegation at the United Nations General Assembly said on Friday, using the country’s official name.\n\nThe two nations – North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies but historic foes – have been at odds for decades over a range of issues including where their continental shelves start and end, energy resources, overflights in the Aegean Sea, the status of demilitarised islands and divided Cyprus.\n\nDuring his address to the UNGA, Mitsotakis said Turkey’s leadership “seems to have a strange fixation with my country”.\n\n“They threaten that Turkey will come at night if it so decides. This is the language of an aggressor. From the UN I would like to address … the Turkish people directly: ‘Greece poses no threat to your country. We are not your enemies, we are neighbours. Let us move forward,” he said.\n\nThe Turkish delegation to the UN said Ankara does not challenge the territorial integrity or unity of Greece, calling it “a false propaganda”.\n\n“However, Turkiye does challenge Greece to enter into an honest and meaningful dialogue in accordance with international law to address not one but all legally interrelated Aegean disputes,” it said.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused Greece this week of “crimes against humanity”, referring to its treatment of refugees, and earlier this month of occupying islands in the Aegean Sea that have a demilitarised status.",

    "Turkey Is No Friend Of India; Modi Must Decipher Erdogan’s ‘Dangerous Ambitions’ That Threaten India & Beyond": "Opinion Article By Padma Shri KN Pandita\n\nSince Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan began to believe that he had a divine mission of reviving the lost grandeur of the Ottoman Empire, he concluded that a road to achieving that ambition lay through the labyrinth of Islamic revivalism.\n\nIn his college days, he was influenced by the Islamic Brotherhood Movement. His pro-Islamist reach is also because of the repeated refusal of the European Union to admit Turkey as a regular member. Deep inside, his inclination towards Islamism springs more from vengeance and much less from conviction in all Islam claims.\n\n“The mask of pro-Europeanism started to erase after continuous attempts by Turkey to be a part of the EU failed. After the 2011 Arab Spring, Erdogan asserted his support for Islamist political forces in the West Asia and North Africa (WANA) region like Mohammad Morsi in Egypt and the ‘Dawn Coalition’ in Libya,” wrote Tahiroglu in Ankara’s Failure.\n\nFirstly, Erdogan supported the Muslim Brotherhood-led Morsi government so much so that when Morsi was deposed in 2013 by al-Sisi in a military coup, and the latter became the president, Erdogan refused to recognize Sisi as a legitimate ruler of Egypt.\n\nSecondly, when the crackdown on Muslim Brotherhood leadership began under Sisi, many of its leaders and sympathizers relocated to Turkey. Thirdly, Erdogan’s support of the Muslim Brotherhood has been one of the main issues of contention between Turkey and its relations with the Arabs.\n\nThe UAE, Jordan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia are also on opposing sides of Turkey in Libya. The Arab monarchies are supporting the General Khalifa Haftar-led Libyan National Army.\n\nErdogan, who has regional ambitions in the Eastern Mediterranean, firmly supports the Government of National Accord, which has close relations with the Islamists and the Muslim Brotherhood. Turkey’s relations with Saudi Arabia have been badly affected after the killing of pro-US Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nHowever, Qatar and Turkey share ideological convergence in supporting the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamist groups like Hamas. Qatar also opposed Morsi’s overthrow, like Turkey. This explains the basis of their friendly relationship.\n\nWhile addressing the Sixth Religious Council meeting of the Presidency of Religious Affairs (DİB) in Ankara in November 2019, Erdogan charged that Muslim countries “look for solutions in the Western capitals for their problems, instead of reaching out to their Muslim brothers and sisters for help.” He contemplates new leadership of the ummah (an Arabic word meaning “community”) and discards the existing one.\n\nErdogan has been trying to gather international muscle around the idea of reviving the Muslim ummah, which other Islamic states like Pakistan and Malaysia have actively supported.\n\nErdogan praised the then Pakistan PM Imran Khan for raising the voice for Muslim ummah and the issue of Kashmir at a reception hosted for the participants of the Third Speakers Conference in Istanbul in October 2019.\n\nAt the UN General Assembly in 2019, Erdogan raked up Kashmir and criticized the international community for not paying attention to the issue.\n\nThis speech came just a month after the Indian government revoked Jammu and Kashmir’s special status (Article 370) in August 2019. He also highlighted the intervention issues in Yemen and Qatar and the Israeli settlements in the West Bank.\n\nTurkey, Pakistan, Malaysia, Iran, and Qatar also tried to create an alternative to the Saudi-dominated Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) by holding an Islamic summit in Kuala Lumpur in 2019.\n\nThis angered Riyadh, which pressured Pakistan to opt out of the summit. Erdogan, Mahathir Mohammad, Hassan Rouhani, and Qatar’s Hamad al-Thani participated in the conference.\n\nThe group creates an impression that most of the Arab peninsula monarchs have abandoned the cause of ummah, especially Palestine and Kashmir. Thus Erdogan tries to wear the crown of the leadership of the ummah.\n\nEven as he continues to work towards reviving the old Ottoman glory and ‘Ittihad-I Islam’ (‘Unity of Islam’), Erdogan will have to choose between a pragmatic vis-à-vis an Islamist foreign policy.\n\nIf the Turkish economy returns to high growth rates, Erdogan’s domestic position will be strengthened, and he might still return to his pet Islamist adventures overseas.\n\nWhat Are His Achievements As The President Of Turkey?\n\n“Erdogan has used his unprecedented power to sweep away judges, media outlets, journalists, academics, military officers, and NGOs. According to one estimate, about 120,000 government employees were suspended, dismissed, or imprisoned in the wake of the coup attempt, primarily from the judiciary and education branches.\n\nOver 7,500 soldiers and officers, including over 100 with the rank of brigadier or above, and over 10,000 policemen were sacked, with countless others imprisoned. More than a dozen colleges and universities and 1,000 schools were closed.\n\nThe licenses of 24 radio and TV channels were revoked, and numerous journalists were arrested”, reported BESA Centre Perspectives Paper No. 1,124, March 27, 2019.\n\nSpeaking at the annual coordination meeting of the OIC held in New York recently, Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said, “As the second largest international organization, the OIC is our collective voice against injustice towards Muslims. I reaffirm our strong solidarity with the Uyghur Turks, the Rohingya Muslims, our Kashmiri brothers, and all other Muslim communities facing injustice worldwide.”\n\nIf this is Turkey’s conviction, why did Erdogan speak about only Kashmir in his recent address to the UN General Assembly and skip the Uyghur Turks? OIC is doing politics, not religion.\n\nWhat makes Erdogan hostile to India is not the alleged disregard for the rights of Indian Muslims. No, that is not true. The truth is that Erdogan is very uncomfortable with Indian secular democracy that treats all citizens at par in the eyes of the law. \\\n\nTo Erdogan and the fundamentalists, the Islamic ummah is special specie and has not to be equated with non-Muslims in terms of civic and other rights. Turkey’s policy towards the Cypriots is also hinged on the same line of thinking.\n\nSuccessive governments in Ankara have always sided with Pakistan on the issue of Kashmir. Jagdish N Singh explains Turkey’s interference in the Indian part of Kashmir in his article ‘Erdogan’s Dangerous Ambitions Threaten India and Beyond.’\n\nAs part of its strategy to attain Muslim leadership status, Ankara has also been reaching out to Indian Muslims. Reliable reports indicate that in the recent past, the Erdogan regime has invited several Indian Islamist leaders, including Zakir Naik, to spread Erdogan’s influence across India.\n\nTurkish cleric Serdar Demirel visited Kolkata in 2016 to participate in a protest march organized by Muslims opposed to the Indian government’s bid to apply a Uniform Civil Code throughout the country. Turkey has also funded Indian NGOs to reach out to Muslim students and influence madrasahs and mosques.\n\nAnkara has given special facilities to Kashmiri Muslim students for admission to professional institutes in Ankara. The daughter of the late Ali Shah Geelani is running a website from Ankara which propagates vicious anti-India and anti-Hindu broadcasts.\n\nMost Kashmiri students who have joined educational institutions in Ankara are taken over by the ISI agents and given good brainwashing.\n\nJagadish N Singh concludes his write-up in these words: “The strategy seems to be working. There are indeed Muslims in India who see Erdogan as a leader of the Muslim world, and they celebrated his victory in the presidential elections of June 2018 in a big way.\n\nKashmiri separatist leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq was among the first to offer congratulations. In a speech to an Islamist group run by Erdogan’s son Bilal in 2017, Naik described the Turkish president as “one of the few Muslim leaders who have the guts to support Islam openly.” He said: “O Muslim world, wake up…May Erdogan be the next ruler of the Muslim world.”\n\nAfter the coup attempt in Turkey, Indian Islamic cleric Maulana Salman Hussaini Nadvi endorsed Erdogan, and the Shahi Imam of Delhi Sayyid Ahmed Bukhari met the Turkish ambassador to India and expressed his support. Delegations from Jamaat-e-Islami Hind, Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, the Chishty Foundation, and the India Islamic Cultural Centre (IICC) met the envoy.\n\nThis narrative about Erdogan’s Islamist credentials should help New Delhi understand how it has to deal with the interference of a radical nature. It must not allow a Turkish Islamist like Demirel to join a domestic protest in India.\n\nThis amounts to interfering with India’s internal matters. New Delhi must not tolerate Ankara’s hobnobbing with an Indian Islamist preacher like Zakir Naik, who is alleged to have inspired a terrorist attack on a cafe in Dhaka in 2016 and has been evading an arrest warrant in India. Doing so is tantamount to encouraging terror against India.\n\nPrime Minister Modi and President Erdogan have met on the sidelines of the Samarkand SCO meet. What transpired between the two is not known.\n\nObservers, commenting on Erdogan’s address to the UN General Assembly just two days after his meeting with Modi in Samarkand, have said that Erdogan toned down his Kashmir tantrum and has now referred to bilateral talks between India and Pakistan on the Kashmir issue.\n\nOne wonders whether Modi raised the problems of the Greece-Turkey dispute, Turkey’s use of brute force against Kurd dissidents, and Turkey’s silence on the atrocities perpetrated on the Uighurs of Xinxiang.\n\nErdogan is living in a glass house, throwing stones at others. He may or may not become the topmost leader of the Islamic ummah; that is no worry for the global society.\n\nThe concern is that he is trying to destabilize the secular-democratic dispensation of the world’s largest democracy which also has the second largest Muslim community as part of its society.

    "Russian men flee the country. Many are showing up in Istanbul": "Russian men flee the country. Many are showing up in Istanbul\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ozan Kose/AFP via Getty Images Ozan Kose/AFP via Getty Images\n\nISTANBUL, Turkey — Russian men continue to flee the country, by land or air, days after President Vladimir Putin's announcement to mobilize additional forces to bolster his flailing war in Ukraine.\n\nAt Istanbul's main airport, a constant stream of Russian men came through the arrivals terminal. Istanbul is a destination of choice because it is one of few places where Russians can travel to without visas, with a long history of Russian tourism.\n\nTurkey, a member of NATO, has sought to cast itself as a neutral power broker between Moscow and Kyiv, and refused to join Western countries in economic sanctions on Russia. Since the beginning of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, many anti-war Russians have settled here, along with refugees from Ukraine.\n\nFlights from Russia to Turkey are sold out for the next several weeks, despite skyrocketing prices. But that hasn't stopped people from finding ways to get out, not only from Russian cities like Moscow, Sochi, Makhachkala and Yekaterinburg but also through neighboring countries Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Belarus and Georgia.\n\nThose who spoke to NPR, at Istanbul Airport, didn't want to reveal their names out of fear of the Russian government. Just last week, Putin signed a law that sentenced those who refused to serve, or evaded service, to 10 years in prison. The men NPR spoke to described long lines at airports and border crossings because of the sheer number of crowds and because of interrogation by Russian authorities.\n\nOne 32-year-old man who flew from St. Petersburg, Russia, told NPR that his flight was \"completely full of men, from 20 and then till 50.\"\n\n\"And all men stopped and — we were interrogated by police,\" he said.\n\n\"There was questions about, for example, when did you buy this ticket? What's the purpose? And the second line, they asked, did you [serve] in the military? When? And did you receive the post that you need to go serve?\" alluding to the conscription notices being served.\n\nA hurried dash to the border, and packed light\n\nNearly all the men said they had packed very light, trying to convince Russian authorities that they were leaving for short trips, and not to evade fighting in the war.\n\nMost said they have no future plans, and limited money. Those with families said their priority was to get settled and then try to bring their families out of Russia as well.\n\nA 35-year-old man, who left his family behind in Irkutsk, near Lake Baikal in Siberia, drove first to the Mongolian border, where he waited six hours to cross. In Mongolia, he said, he ran into several of his friends who were also fleeing, before he caught a flight to Istanbul.\n\nSome men said they decided to leave the country as soon as they heard the conscription announcement last Wednesday. The man from Irkutsk said he waited a few days to see what would happen, but once his friends started getting rounded up at night, he made the decision to go.\n\n\"They aren't just taking the reservists, but also men who have no military history and even those with more than three children,\" he said.\n\nRussian authorities, including Putin, had assured the public that only those with prior military service, no illnesses and fewer than three children would be called upon to serve.\n\nSeveral men told NPR that those who speak up against the war and mobilization are being arrested, beaten in custody and then sent to be drafted in the war — which is why women have been overwhelmingly taking part in the recent public protests in Russia.\n\nIt's about to get worse\n\nNearly everyone who spoke to NPR said they believed the situation is going to get worse, that a full mobilization is imminent.\n\nRussia is now conducting what it claims are referendums — considered illegal under international law — in occupied Ukrainian territories on whether to formally join Russia. The 32-year-old man from St. Petersburg told NPR many in Russia see it as the first step for Putin to annex those areas as part of Russia.\n\n\"Then of course the Ukrainians will attack those areas because actually it's their territory. Then after that, I think [Putin will] decide 'OK, they attacked our territory,' and he'll make the full mobilization,\" he said.\n\nAnother man, in a hurry to leave the airport, only said, \"everything is worse than you know and Russian men are going anywhere they can now.\"\n\nOne 36-year-old man from Moscow told NPR that his reason to leave was not just because he didn't want to fight, but that it was his way of not supporting the military campaign.\n\n\"If you are against the war, the best thing to do is try to get out from there and don't support it as we can, not pay taxes or don't work in Russian companies, etc.,\" he said.\n\nJust a few said they were hopeful that there would be a peace agreement to end the war, and hoped to wait it out before eventually returning home.",
    "Turkey's Anti-LGBTQ Display Reflects Nation's Political Shift": "The 25-year-old translator by day and trans drag performer by night felt overwhelming panic and anxiety when several thousand demonstrators gathered and marched Sunday in Turkey to demand a ban on what they consider gay propaganda and to outlaw LGBTQ organizations.\n\nThe Big Family Gathering march in the conservative heart of Istanbul attracted parents with children, nationalists, hard-line Islamists and conspiracy theorists. Turkey's media watchdog gave the event the government's blessing by including a promotional video that called LGBTQ people a \"virus\" in its list of public service announcements for broadcasters.\n\n\"We need to make all our defense against this LGBT. We need to get rid of it,\" said construction worker Mehmet Yalcin, 21, who attended the event wearing a black headband printed with Islam's testimony of faith. \"We are sick of and truly uncomfortable that our children are being encouraged and pulled to this.\n\nSeeing images from the gathering terrified Willie Ray, the drag performer who identifies as nonbinary, and Willie Ray's mother, who was in tears after talking to her child. The fear wasn't misplaced. The Europe branch of the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association ranked Turkey second to last, ahead of only Azerbaijan, in its most recent 49-country legal equality index, saying LGBTQ people endured \"countless hate crimes.\"\n\n\"I feel like I can be publicly lynched,\" Willie Ray said, describing the daily sense of dread that comes with living in Istanbul. The performer recalls leaving a nightclub still in makeup on New Year's Eve and hurrying to get to a taxi as strangers on the street called out slurs and \"tried to hunt me, basically.\"\n\nSunday's march was the biggest anti-LGBTQ demonstration of its kind in Turkey, where civil rights for a community more commonly referred to here as LGBTI+ — lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and other gender identities and sexual orientations — have been under assault in the years since an estimated 100,000 people celebrated Pride in Istanbul in 2014.\n\nIn a visible sign of the shift, the anti-LGBTQ march went ahead without any police interference. Conversely, LGBTQ groups have had their freedom to assemble severely curtailed since 2015, with officials citing both security and morality grounds.\n\nPolice used tear gas and water cannons to disperse the Pride march planned for that year. Government officials have since banned the event. Activists have tried to gather anyway, and more than 370 people were detained in Istanbul in June.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan's views also have grown more stridently anti-LGBTQ over time. Before the 2002 election that brought the Justice and Development Party (AKP) he co-founded to power, a younger Erdogan said at a televised campaign event that he found mistreatment of gay people inhumane and legal protections for them in Turkey a \"must.\"\n\n\"And now, 20 years into this, you have an entirely different president that seems to be mobilizing based on these dehumanizing, criminal approaches to the LGBTQ movement itself,\" said Mine Eder, a political science professor at Bogazici University in Istanbul.\n\nInterior Minister Suleyman Soylu has called LGBTQ people \"perverts.\" In 2020, Erdogan defended the head of religious affairs after he claimed homosexuality \"brings disease and causes the generation to decay.\" While championing his long-held belief that the identities of women are rooted in motherhood and family, the Turkish leader last year urged people to dismiss what \"lesbians schmesbians\" say.\n\nTurkey also withdrew from a European treaty protecting women against violence, after lobbying from conservative groups that claimed the treaty promoted homosexuality.\n\nThe country could become more unwelcoming for the LGBTQ community. The Unity in Ideas and Struggle Platform, the organizer of Sunday's event, said it plans to push for a law that would ban the alleged LGBTQ \"propaganda\" that the group maintains is pervasive on Netflix and social media, as well as in arts and sports.\n\nThe platform's website states it also favors a ban on LGBTQ organizations.\n\n\"We are a Muslim country and we say no to this. Our statesmen and the other parties should all support this,\" said Betul Colak, who attended Sunday's gathering wearing a scarf with the Turkish flag.\n\nHaunted by \"the feeling that you can be attacked anytime,\" Willie Ray thinks it would be a \"total catastrophe\" if a ban on the LGBTQ organizations that provide visibility, psychological support and safe spaces were enacted.\n\nEder, the professor, said it would be \"simply illegal\" to close down LGBTQ civil society based on ideological, Islamic and conservative norms — even if Turkey's norms have indeed shifted to \"using violent language, violent strategies and legalizing them.\"\n\nThe Social Policy, Gender Identity and Sexual Orientation Studies Association, a nongovernmental LGBTQ advocacy and outreach organization in Istanbul commonly known as SPoD, is among the LGBTQ groups that stopped posting their addresses online after receiving threatening calls.\n\n\"It's easy for a maniac to try and hurt us after all the hate speech from state officials,\" said SPoD lobbyist Ogulcan Yediveren, 27. \"But these security concerns, this atmosphere of fear, doesn't stop us from work and instead reminds us every time how much we need to work.\"\n\nGay activist Umut Rojda Yildirim, who works as SPoD's lawyer, thinks the anti-LGBTQ sentiments on view Sunday aren't dominant across Turkish society, but that the minority expressing them seem \"louder when they have government funds, when they're supported by the government watchdog.\"\n\n\"You can just shut down an office, but I'm not going to disappear. My other colleagues aren't going to disappear. We'll be here no matter what,\" Yildirim said.",
    "Can the SCO be Turkey’s alternative to the West?": "Erdogan suggests Turkey will seek full membership of the Russia and China-led Shanghai Cooperation Organisation amid strained ties with the West.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has expressed his NATO-member country’s intention to become a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), suggesting Ankara is seeking alternatives to its problematic ties with the West.\n\nErdogan, who made the remarks after attending last week’s SCO summit in Uzbekistan, was also quoted as saying by the Turkish media that the SCO’s 2023 meeting in India will be a venue to discuss this prospect further.\n\nChina, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Pakistan, India and Uzbekistan are the full members of the of the political, economic, and security organisation.\n\nAfghanistan, Belarus, Iran, and Mongolia are SCO observer countries, while Armenia, Azerbaijan, Cambodia, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Turkey are the bloc’s dialogue partners.\n\n“Our ties with these countries will be moved to a much different position,” Erdogan told reporters on Saturday.\n\nWhen asked by reporters if he meant Turkey would seek to become a member of the organisation, the president said: “Of course, that’s the target.”\n\nThe SCO is not seen as an alternative to NATO, a military alliance with collective defence responsibilities under Article 5 of its founding treaty, which considers an armed attack against one or more members to be considered “an attack against all”.\n\nMensur Akgun, a professor of international relations, told Al Jazeera that the SCO is an hybrid bloc that seeks to prevent a vacuum in Central and South Asia through cooperation.\n\n“It aims to increase dialogue and cooperation, solve problems among its members when needed and stand in solidarity with one another against interventions in the region by outside powers,” he said, adding that the SCO is closer to the model of the European Union than to NATO.\n\n“An organisation that has arch-rivals India and Pakistan under its umbrella would not be able to have automatic military interdependence like NATO has,” Akgun said.\n\nAkgun also said that growing political and economic ties between Turkey and Russia in recent years contributed to Erdogan’s remarks on SCO membership, especially considering Turkey’s often tense relations with Western powers.\n\nTurkey bought Russia’s S-400 defence systems, which prompted US sanctions in addition to Turkey’s removal from a US-led programme developing F-35 fighter jets. Russia is also building Turkey’s first nuclear power plant and the two countries signed an economic cooperation deal in August.\n\nEven though Turkey and Russia backed opposing sides in Syria’s war, the two countries have largely coordinated closely during the conflict.\n\nThe Turkish government has also taken a balanced stance over Moscow’s February invasion of Ukraine. It has provided Ukraine with arms, in particular with drones, but it has not imposed sanctions on Russia and criticised what it calls Western policies “based on provocations” towards Moscow.\n\nAnkara has tried to act as a mediator between Russia and Ukraine since the beginning of the conflict and helped broker an agreement in July for Ukrainian grain ships to sail to outside markets.\n\nStrained ties with the West\n\nGalip Dalay, a nonresident senior fellow at the Middle East Council on Global Affairs, said that Erdogan’s remarks on SCO membership stem from Ankara’s tensions with the West.\n\n“Whenever there is discontent with the West – in particular, with the US [over] the perception that Turkey is treated unfairly – the idea of alternatives come up,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\n“And because of that Ankara currently believes Turkey’s interests are better served by a balancing act between different centres of powers – meaning China, Russia and the West,” Dalay said.\n\nAnkara has also been at odds with the US and certain EU member states over their support for Syrian Kurdish fighters who allied with the West in the fight against ISIL (ISIS) in the war-torn country.\n\nTurkey considers the Syrian Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG), the main part of the anti-ISIL alliance, to be an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which has been fighting against the Turkish state for decades.\n\nErdogan threatened to block Sweden and Finland’s NATO bids over what he said was their support for these groups, but lifted his opposition after a meeting with US President Joe Biden in June.\n\nFollowing the move, Biden expressed support for sales of F-16 jets to Turkey – warplanes currently in use and inferior to the F-35s in development. However, he needs the approval of the US Congress for the move.\n\nIn July, the US House of Representatives approved an amendment creating a new hurdle for Biden’s plan to sell F-16s to Turkey, imposing strict conditions to any sales.\n\nErdogan said last week that his government might consider other options if the US is unable to fulfil its promise to provide the jets.\n\nRecently, escalating tensions in the Mediterranean Sea between NATO members Turkey and Greece have also prompted the EU and the US to condemn Turkey.\n\nAnkara and Athens are at odds over an array of issues such as overflights, the status of islands between the two countries, maritime boundaries and hydrocarbon resources.\n\nHowever, Akgun believes that Turkey is unlikely to gain SCO membership for several reasons, considering the bloc’s structure and purposes.\n\n“Turkey’s membership to the SCO does not seem possible as a NATO member and an EU candidate, but also because it is currently geographically and politically irrelevant to the SCO’s purposes of existence,” Akgun said.",
    "Queer singer tries to create space for discussion in Turkey": "September 23, 2022\n\nIstanbul, Turkey — In early August, Fatih Karaca, better known as Mabel Matiz, stood on stage in Istanbul. As the first chords of one of his most famous songs, \"Alaimisema,\" an old Turkish word meaning “rainbow,” began to swell, he spoke to the sold-out crowd.\n\n“Humans are creatures that are very susceptible to excluding the other, to alienating the other, to becoming hostile, to excluding what they do not know,” Matiz said. “But underneath all that, I think we all know that we are the same deep down.”\n\nMatiz knows this intimately. Despite his queer identity, Matiz is beloved by fans across the political and religious spectrum. He says his music creates a space where people in Turkey can explore controversial topics — a space ever-rarer in a politically and culturally polarized country.\n\n“I have worked hard to create music that can share a common point with everyone,” Matiz told Al-Monitor.\n\nHe was born in 1985 in a small town in southern Turkey. A solitary child, he says music was his “savior,” a way to explore the wider world and a form of expression. When young he had a stutter, but when he sang, it disappeared.\n\nWhen he moved to Istanbul in the early 2000s to study dentistry, the city teemed with youthful energy. Many were hopeful that the election of the Justice and Development Party (AKP) government in 2002 would lead to a more liberal environment, as the party then espoused a more open stance on rights for minority groups, including LGBTQ people.\n\nIn 2008, he started a page on MySpace, then a popular social media site, under the pseudonym Mabel Matiz. Mabel was a name from a character in a book by Buket Uzuner, \"Kumral Ada Mavi Tuna.\" Matiz was derived from the ancient Greek word for “drunkard.”\n\nWithin two years, Matiz was one of the most popular names on Turkey’s MySpace. Listeners and producers were taken by his fusion of pop, rock, and Turkish folk. His lyrics wove together folklore and poetry with urban stories.\n\n“My songs can talk about anything. They could talk about a story in a village or the back streets of Berlin, they could talk about a love affair or a more spiritual, divine kind of love,” he said.\n\nIn 2011, the underground success of his first album, “Mabel Matiz,” allowed him to pivot full-time to music. Now, Matiz has four albums, over 2 million monthly listeners on Spotify, and his YouTube videos get more than 5 million views.\n\nBut in the meanwhile, Turkey has seen a dramatic rise in homophobia, as the AKP seeks to shore up its conservative base.\n\nLast week, Turkey’s largest-ever anti-LGBT rally took place in Istanbul, with signs that called queer people “perverts.”\n\n“In the last two years, the government has ramped up the anti-LGBT [stance],” Kenan Sharpe, an academic who studies Turkish pop culture, told Al-Monitor. “It’s become a specific policy of theirs, this culture war they’re trying to start.”\n\nFollowing the Gezi Park protests of 2013, the government has hardened its rhetoric against LGBTQ people, many of whom joined the protests.\n\nIn 2021, Erdogan said there was “no such thing as LGBT” people in Turkey. Pride marches have been banned since 2015.\n\n“The LGBTI+ community is under great pressure,\" Matiz said. \"What happens every year at Pride saddens me.”\n\nDespite the increasingly hostile climate, on July 1 — just days after police violently cracked down on this year’s Pride events — Matiz released his controversial recent hit \"Karakol\" or \"Copshop,\" gaining more than 17 million views to date.\n\nThe video depicts a young man leaning on Matiz’s knee as Matiz sings that his heart has been “put in the police station,” and his love put in a grave. He compares his lover to forbidden fruit.\n\nThe song and video were met with an outpouring of both praise and outrage. The head of Turkey’s broadcasting watchdog RTUK reportedly called television stations, demanding they not air the clip.\n\nDespite that, Matiz was pleased that the song got people talking.\n\nAccording to Ozan Korkmaz, Matiz’s manager, censorship has failed to scrap the song's impact as it inspired rare and important conversations.\n\n“I think it is very, very critical to make people think about it, talk a little, feel something different even within themselves, by throwing something new at them from time to time,” Korkmaz told Al-Monitor.\n\nAs he works on a fifth album that’s slated to be released in early 2023, Matiz says he will write more songs exploring similar themes.\n\n“I'm not afraid,” he said. “There is no room for such fear in my life or my head.”",
    "Turkey vows to defend interests against Greece amid tensions": "ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkey on Monday summoned the Greek ambassador to protest the alleged deployment of dozens of U.S.-made armored vehicles to Greek islands which Ankara says should remain demilitarized in line with international treaties.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned, meanwhile, that Turkey wouldn't hold back on defending its rights and interests against Greece.\n\nTurkish media on Sunday published aerial images that they said showed the deployment of armored vehicles by Greece to the Aegean islands of Samos and Lesbos, heightening tensions between the two NATO countries that have a history of rivalry. Turkish officials say the deployment is in violation of the islands' nonmilitary status according to international law.\n\nTurkish officials summoned Greek Ambassador Christodoulos Lazaris to the Turkish Foreign Ministry on Monday, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported. It said Turkey also filed a protest with Washington, but didn't provide details.\n\nErdogan accused Greece of engaging in acts of provocation against Turkey.\n\n“We will not fail to defend our country’s rights and interests against Greece by using all the means at our disposal, when necessary,” Erdogan said following a Cabinet meeting.\n\nTurkey and Greece have decades-old disputes over an array of issues, including territorial claims in the Aegean Sea and disputes over the airspace there. The disputes have brought them to the brink of war three times in the last half-century.\n\nTensions flared in 2020 over exploratory drilling rights in areas of the Mediterranean Sea — where Greece and Cyprus claim exclusive economic zones — leading to a naval standoff.\n\nMore recently, Turkey has accused Greece of violating international agreements by militarizing islands in the Aegean Sea. It has also accused Greek surface-to-air missiles of locking on to Turkish F-16 fighter jets carrying out a reconnaissance mission in international airspace — an accusation Greece has rejected.\n\nAthens says it needs to defend the islands — many of which lie close to Turkey’s coast — against a potential attack from Turkey.\n\nA Greek government official told The Associated Press that Greece “fully respects” its international obligations, adding that the Greek ambassador told his interlocuters that “Greece is not the country that is threatening its neighbor with war or assembling a large landing force on its coastline as Turkey has done.”\n\nThe official added that Turkey “continues to violate Greece’s sovereignty with its continuous violations of its airspace and overflights of Greek territory.” The official, who wasn't authorized to speak publicly to the news media, made the remarks on condition of anonymity.\n\nTurkish media reports quoted security officials as saying 23 of the armored vehicles were sent to Lesbos and 18 others were sent to Samos.\n\nMeanwhile, Greek authorities said a six-year-old migration agreement between Turkey and the European Union remains in effect despite an escalating dispute between the two neighbors over the treatment of refugees.\n\nNotis Mitarachi, the migration affairs minister, said Greece will continue to observe the 2016 deal that allows it to send back most migrants travelling illegally from nearby Turkey.\n\n“It is clear that for those coming from Syria, Afghanistan, Somalia, Pakistan and Bangladesh, that Turkey is a safe country,” Mitarachi said. “Unfortunately, smugglers are still ‘selling tickets’ to people from those countries.”\n\nSpeaking at the U.N. General Assembly, Erdogan last week accused Greece of committing “crimes against humanity” by carrying out potentially deadly expulsions of migrants travelling from the Turkish mainland to nearby Greek islands.\n\nGreek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis described the claims as “absurd,” charging Turkey with “weaponizing” migration to apply political pressure on Greece and other European countries.\n\n___\n\nDerek Gatopoulos reported from Athens, Greece.\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

    "Turkey: Plastic Recycling Harms Health, Environment": "(Istanbul) – Plastic recycling in Turkey is harming the health of many people and degrading the environment for everyone, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today.\n\nThe 88-page report, “‘It’s as If They’re Poisoning Us’: The Health Impacts of Plastic Recycling in Turkey,” documents the consequences of the Turkish government’s ineffective response to the health and environmental impacts of plastic recycling on the right to health. Air pollutants and toxins emitted from recycling affect workers, including children, and people living near recycling facilities.\n\nThe government fails to enforce laws and regulations that require strict licensing and regular, thorough inspections of recycling facilities and occupational health, greatly exacerbating facilities’ impacts on health and the environment. Plastic waste imported from the European Union is significantly contributing to these abuses.\n\n“Turkey has regulations to protect people and the environment, but a lack of enforcement is increasing people’s risk of serious, life-long health conditions,” said Krista Shennum, Gruber Fellow in the Environment and Human Rights division at Human Rights Watch. “The government of Turkey needs to do more to meet its obligations to protect people from the effects of toxic plastic recycling.”\n\nHuman Rights Watch interviewed 64 people, including 26 who currently work or previously worked in plastic recycling facilities in Istanbul and Adana and 21 who live near plastic recycling facilities. Five of the workers were children at the time of the interview, and four adults interviewed began working in a plastic recycling facility as children.\n\nWorkers and residents of neighboring communities described respiratory problems, severe headaches, skin ailments, lack of protective equipment, and little to no access to medical treatment for occupational illnesses. Many of the facilities Human Rights Watch visited were located dangerously close to homes, in contravention of Turkish laws and environmental regulations.\n\nTo be recycled, plastic waste is shredded, washed, melted at high temperatures, and then turned into pellets. This process emits air pollutants and toxins that, without adequate protections, can contribute to short-term health problems, including asthma, difficulty breathing, and eye irritation. Scientists have also linked exposure to these toxins to an increased risk of cancer, neurological impacts, and reproductive system harm. In addition, plastics are made from fossil fuels and toxic additives and also release significant amounts of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to the climate crisis.\n\nSince the Chinese government banned plastic waste imports in 2018, many countries in the Global North have scrambled to find new destinations for their plastic waste. Because of its geographic proximity, strong trade relations with the European Union, and status as an Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development member, Turkey has become the primary destination for the EU’s plastic waste, receiving nearly half of the EU’s plastic waste exports in 2020 and 2021.\n\nMany recycling facility workers are from the most vulnerable populations in Turkey and include children, refugees, and undocumented migrants. Some workers, including undocumented migrants, said they do not have access to medical services if they get sick or are injured in the workplace. Fear over losing their jobs made workers wary about raising concerns with their employers over harmful working conditions, including working without access to personal protective equipment.\n\nHuman Rights Watch found that children work in plastic recycling facilities in Turkey even though Turkish law prohibits them from working in such hazardous conditions and the exposure to pollution and toxins is especially damaging to their health.\n\n“There’s a huge cauldron where they’re cooking the material, they keep adding water which comes back up as steam,” said a 20-year-old waste picker in Adana who had worked at a plastic recycling center as a child. “When I inhaled that, it would feel like my lungs were squeezed and under pressure … I stopped working there two months ago, but I still have a problem with breathing.”\n\nResidents of neighboring communities said intense odors and pollution from plastic recycling prevent them from sleeping, opening their windows, and spending time outside.\n\n“My 27-year-old sister died of colon cancer, this was 10 years ago,” said a 35-year-old man whose family lived for decades near recycling facilities. He believes that living near recycling facilities is a factor in the deaths of four relatives. “My brother died at 34 years of lung cancer four years ago. I believe it is the effect of the recycling plants.”\n\nHuman Rights Watch found that workers and nearby residents are not provided with basic information about levels of toxins in their environment, risks from those toxic exposures, or ways to minimize those risks despite the law requiring Turkish authorities and employers to monitor conditions and share this information.\n\nWhile it is mandatory for plastic recycling facilities to acquire licenses and permits from the relevant authorities, it is unclear exactly how many meet this requirement and how many operate without licenses. Licenses require adherence to environmental and occupational health standards that would limit health risks. For licensed facilities, environmental, occupational health, and labor inspections often fail to adequately examine environmental and health conditions.\n\nHuman Rights Watch wrote to key ministries and municipalities in Turkey to share initial research findings and seek information on plastic recycling facilities, air quality data, inspection reports, rates of illness related to toxic exposure, plastic waste import data, and child labor. In some cases, Human Rights Watch did not receive a response. In other instances, the responses received were incomplete and did not provide answers to the questions posted. For example, the Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change said that it had undertaken thousands of inspections of waste disposal and recycling facilities since 2018 and fined facilities and closed unlicensed ones. Yet, the ministry did not provide specific data for plastic recycling facilities, and the findings of Human Rights Watch's report show the need for more resolute steps to address pervasive violations of the right to health.\n\nThe Turkish Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change should conduct independent and thorough inspections of recycling facilities to ensure compliance with environmental regulations and to make information about the risks of air pollution and toxin exposure readily available and accessible, Human Rights Watch said. The Ministry of Labor and Social Security should enforce Turkey’s ban on child labor in hazardous workplaces, including plastic recycling facilities.\n\nCountries that export plastic waste, including those in the EU, should take steps to more effectively manage their plastic waste domestically, rather than shipping their waste to countries with weak or inadequate government enforcement of environmental and labor regulations. The Turkish government should reinstate the ban on imported plastic waste for recycling, which it introduced in July 2021 but quickly lifted.\n\n“Europe’s wealthiest countries are sending their trash to Turkey, consigning some of Turkey’s most vulnerable communities, including children, refugees and migrants, to serious environmental and health risks,” Shennum said. “The EU and individual plastic-exporting countries should take responsibility for their own plastic waste, end the export of plastic to Turkey, and reduce the amount of plastic they produce and consume.”",
    "Russians against the war seek refuge in Turkey": "Russians against the war seek refuge in Turkey\n\nRussian men are fleeing the country to avoid being forced into the military and the war in Ukraine. Many are going to Turkey, where they do not need a visa to enter.\n\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nIn Russia, there are long lines along the border and flights out of the country are sold out as men of military age try to get out. The exodus follows Russian President Vladimir Putin's decision to mobilize tens of thousands of reservists after the Russian military lost ground to Ukraine's counteroffensive. Many of those fleeing are headed to Turkey, one of the few countries that allows Russians to come in without a visa. NPR's Fatma Tanis was at Istanbul's main airport.\n\nFATMA TANIS, BYLINE: Of the many travelers trickling through international arrivals at Istanbul airport, the Russians stand out. There is a palpable sense of urgency, even frustration, and they're carrying little to no luggage to convince Russian authorities they were leaving for short trips and not to evade fighting in the war. Most of them declined to be interviewed. One man frantically looks around and asks if I have a secret camera on him, and those who did speak didn't want to reveal their names, fearing retribution from the Russian government. I meet two friends in their early 30s who just arrived from Saint Petersburg. They're carrying slim backpacks and small briefcases. I ask one of them if he has a plan.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Don't know yet.\n\nTANIS: This is all you have?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Yes.\n\nTANIS: OK. Did you pack in a rush?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Yeah, actually, yes.\n\nTANIS: Switching to Russian, he says he made the decision to leave the day before after seeing news that police were interrogating men who are leaving the country. It was hard to find a ticket by that point.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Very expensive. Now it's very difficult to buy tickets abroad. It was about 3,000 euro.\n\nTANIS: When they both got to the airport in Saint Petersburg, they were interrogated, too. The other man described what that was like.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: The whole flight was completely full of men, for example, from 20 and then till 50, I think. And all men just stopped and was - we were interrogated by police.\n\nTANIS: He says they were asked when they bought their tickets, the purpose of their trip, whether they'd served in the military before and if they'd received a notice to fight. These men haven't yet. But...\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Yeah, I'm worrying. Yes. About this...\n\nTANIS: You're worried.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: For sure.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Yes. Yeah.\n\nTANIS: Do you think that you can go back to your country any time soon?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: No, I don't believe.\n\nTANIS: So this is it?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Yeah. This is it. Now we can plan something because everything changing very fast.\n\nTANIS: Things are moving quickly in Russia. Just today, President Putin signed a refusal of service law - 10 years in prison for those caught fleeing service. Everyone I spoke with here said they were against the war in Ukraine. They know many people in Russia who are, too, and many others who do support the invasion. The issue has caused rifts between friendships and family. But people who speak out against the war and, more recently, the mobilization have been arrested. There are even reports that they're getting drafted while in police custody to be sent to Ukraine. One 36-year-old man who came from Moscow says the best thing to do is...\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Try to get out from there and don't support it as we can, not pay taxes or don't work in Russian companies, etc.\n\nTANIS: He says Russians who are against the war are very scared now, but they can't stop it. The only options are to leave or go to jail. He says there are no other choices. Fatma Tanis, NPR News, Istanbul.\n\nCopyright © 2022 NPR. All rights reserved.

    "Freight costs rise as Turkey eyes multimodal infrastructure via Istanbul Canal": "For the first time in nearly 40 years, Turkey will increase the fees for ships transiting the Bosphorus on 7 October, by 500%, to $4/tonne.\n\nThis, however, is just the start of price hikes for vessels transiting the Turkish Straits. In June 2021, construction of the Istanbul Canal began. This controversial infrastructure project will create a man-made canal just west of the Bosphorus.\n\nThe canal will be 45 km in length, 360m wide, and 20.75m deep, creating a smooth navigable means to bypass the Bosphorus Strait. Its anticipated capacity is 160 vessels a day.\n\nThe stated aim of the canal is to reduce congestion on the Bosphorus, and the potential for environmental disasters from ships carrying dangerous goods.\n\nPlans for related infrastructure are extensive: an estimated $20bn is planned for major real estate development of land surrounding the canal and the construction of various amenities, including a marina, container port and logistics hub.\n\nAs the largest infrastructure project the country has ever seen, it will form part of a multimodal transport system in which Turkey aims to present itself as a logistics hub, with the nearby Istanbul Airport also expected to be linked.\n\nControversy surrounding the project stems from its potential impact on the 1936 Montreux Convention, which limits the charges Ankara can levy on vessels using the Turkish Straits and regulates the movement of military vessels.\n\nThe Turkish government remains circumspect about whether the Istanbul Canal will be governed under the Convention, and indeed whether the Convention could be repealed entirely.\n\nDr Tuba Eldem, research fellow at the Centre for Applied Turkish Studies, explained to The Loadstar that “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has advanced the importance of the project. Now that there are sanctions on the Northern corridor, Turkey expects more trade coming from China through central Asia”.\n\nFurther, Dr Eldem explained: “Now that Russia is not providing energy through Nordstream 2, more energy for Europe will come through the Turkish Straits. If this war continues for a long time, some of this energy would come through the Istanbul Canal.”\n\nAs transit fees will be charged for the use of the canal, Dr Eldem explained that the waterway will make the movement of goods between the Mediterranean and Black Sea much more expensive for shippers.\n\nIt is still unknown what the exact fees will be, but Ankara expects to generate $8bn in annual revenues from the canal.\n\nTurkey believes shippers will prefer to use the canal instead of the Bosphorus due to easier navigation, reduced congestion and decreased risk.\n\nHowever, it is unknown yet whether Turkey will limit the use of the Bosphorus in order to push ships to the canal to generate higher revenues.\n\nA further potential controversy is that the Montreux Convention regulates the movement of naval vessels in and out of the Black Sea.\n\nBy providing an alternative route outside the Convention, Turkey, a NATO signatory, would acquire sole control of the movement of warships in and out of the Black Sea, giving it substantial leverage to negotiate directly with major powers.\n\nDr Eldem argued: “The project gains more importance in the geopolitical reordering after the invasion of Ukraine.” She explained the construction of the canal “is a signal of a shift Westwards for Turkey”.\n\nA former senior European defence official told The Loadstar: “The building of the canal would be a net positive, relatively, for the West.”\n\nHowever, the official noted: “The fact that the canal is not bound by treaty means there could be escalation.” Putin has cited the importance of preserving the Convention to “ensure regional stability and security”, as the new canal could allow NATO increased access into the Black Sea.\n\n“The most dramatic impact will be on Russia, as the state that most frequently uses the Turkish Strait,” said Dr Eldem. “While the canal will give Turkey more leverage, it may cause problems with Moscow in the short-term, so I don’t think Turkey will be willing to try any moves that could be interpreted as a violation of Montreux in the current political context.”\n\nChina is thought to have shown the most interest in funding the project, with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the Bank of China cited as potential financiers.\n\nDiscussions of the construction have been a priority item on the agenda of China’s diplomatic visits to Turkey. HSBC, as well as financial institutions from the Netherlands, Belgium, and Russia have also declared interest in funding the project.\n\n“Everyone is afraid of China’s contribution” said Dr Eldem, “and whether China will put conditionality on the funding as a kind of leverage.” The European defence official, however, explained that “if Turkey didn’t want Chinese military leverage, they wouldn’t let it”.\n\nEnvironmental groups have heavily criticised the project, citing potential disruption of Istanbul’s water supplies, triggering earthquakes, deforestation, and destruction of marine life by changes to the mineral and nutrient balance of the Black Sea.",

    "Turkey and the Arab World: Ankara’s Shifting Relations and Evolving Foreign Policy": "Speakers Hürcan Aslı Aksoy Deputy Head of the Center for Applied Turkey Studies (CATS) German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP) Meliha Altunışık Professor at the Department of International Relations Middle East Technical University Nicholas Danforth Senior Non-Resident Fellow Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy (ELIAMEP) Gönül Tol Founding Director of the Turkey program and Senior Fellow for the Frontier Europe Initiative Middle East Institute\n\nModerator Mustafa Gurbuz Senior Faculty in the Department of Critical Race, Gender, and Culture American University\n\nAbout the Webinar\n\nFor much of the past decade, and especially following the Arab Spring in 2011, Turkey’s Justice and Development Party (AKP) has developed a policy in the Arab world that is focused on projecting power, expanding the country’s influence, and pursuing nationalist and Islamist ideological objectives. Turkey’s efforts in this regard include backing popular uprisings, supporting Islamist movements, expanding military activities in Syria and Iraq, military intervention in Libya, and publicly criticizing Gulf states, Egypt, and Israel. In the last couple of years, however, Turkey has been recalibrating its foreign policy and attempting to normalize relations with other countries in the region. Ankara’s recent rapprochement with Saudi Arabia despite the Khashoggi murder in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul; its increasingly warm relations with Egypt, Israel, and the UAE; and its potential reconciliation with the Syrian regime all represent a broader strategy aimed at improving relations with former rivals in the region and at ending Turkey’s isolation. This policy shift also responds to geopolitical reconfigurations and growing competition, and seeks to address domestic economic and political challenges that President Erdoğan is facing, especially in the run-up to Turkey’s 2023 elections.\n\nArab Center Washington DC is convening a panel of experts to discuss Turkey’s evolving foreign policy and its shifting relations with the Arab world. Panelists will address both global and regional dynamics, factors impacting Ankara’s foreign policy considerations, and the question of whether these changes reflect a real shift in Turkey’s regional policy. Is Ankara sending mixed messages to regional actors and to Washington by renewing its relations with Israel and Gulf countries while also expanding its military presence in the eastern Mediterranean? How do these shifts relate to Turkey’s concerns regarding security, energy, and Kurdish aspirations for self-determination? What role do the upcoming Turkish elections play in its regional policies? And what are the likely scenarios for Turkey’s policy decisions if Erdogan loses these elections?",

The ban was initially imposed during the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, when all foreign travel was prohibited.\n\nKhashoggi’s killing, which occurred in October 2018 at the consulate, sparked worldwide condemnation from human rights organisations, politicians and celebrities alike.\n\nUS intelligence officers then accused Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of ordering the dissident journalist’s murder, which the de facto Saudi leader has continuously denied.\n\nHis murder led to bin Salman becoming shunned on the international stage, but world leaders and countries have since began to revive their relations with the Gulf kingdom in the wake of depleting Russian gas supplies following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.",

General Assembly on Tuesday, thawing a 14-year chill and heralding hopes of collaboration fueled by the possibility of exporting natural gas to an energy-desperate Europe. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight Lapid’s office said that Tuesday’s meeting in New York was the first face-to-face encounter between leaders of the two countries since 2008 and that they discussed “economic and energy cooperation.”\n\nA month ago, Israel and Turkey announced a full restoration of diplomatic ties and exchange of ambassadors, a development that Lapid described as “an important asset for regional stability and very important economic news for the citizens of Israel.”\n\nTurkey, the first Muslim country to recognize Israel as a state and, before 2008, one of its strongest allies in the region, has over the past decade and a half intensely challenged Israel over its treatment of Palestinians. Erdogan has repeatedly made parallels between his own democratically elected Islamist party and Hamas, which rules the blockaded Gaza Strip, calling it “a resistance movement that defends the Palestinian homeland against an occupying power.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTurkey’s increasing criticism of Israeli treatment of Palestinians caused diplomatic tumult. In 2010, Ankara recalled its ambassador after an Israeli naval commando raid on a Gaza-bound aid flotilla resulted in the deaths of 10 Turkish activists. Tensions again boiled over in 2018, following bloody protests on the Gaza border provoked by President Donald Trump’s decision to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, and Turkey and Israel recalled their respective ambassadors.\n\nBut the tide has turned in recent months, as Israel, exploiting its recently discovered offshore natural gas sites, seeks to export billions of cubic meters to a European market seeking to wean itself from Russian supplies.\n\nIsraeli gas is part of a global, patchwork energy strategy being forged by European leaders looking ahead to a potentially difficult winter. Russia’s pipeline gas today makes up 9 percent of all imported gas to the European Union, compared with 40 percent before Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs part of this effort, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen signed a deal with Israeli and Egyptian leaders in June that will enable Israel to pipe natural gas to Europe via Egyptian liquefaction facilities.\n\nAs a result of the diplomatic strain, Ankara abandoned talks years ago to build an underwater natural gas pipeline linking Israel to Europe via Turkey.\n\nBut Erdogan called a visit to Turkey in March by Israeli President Isaac Herzog, the first in over a decade, “an opportunity to revive the cooperation on the topic of energy that began before.”\n\nAt his speech before the General Assembly on Tuesday, Erdogan highlighted energy as a priority in Turkey’s foreign policy.\n\n“Turkey has always looked at energy as a field of cooperation rather than competition,” he said. “In addition to our own needs, we have implemented many projects that support regional and global energy security.”\n\nZeynep Karatas in Istanbul contributed to this report.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",
    "US designated key operatives of IRGC Quds Force who work with Turkey’s intelligence chief": "Abdullah Bozkurt/Stockholm\n\nThe US designation of a Turkish-based money laundering network run by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force hit the close associates of Turkish intelligence chief Hakan Fidan, a pro-Iranian Islamist figure.\n\nThe designation, announced by the US Treasury in May, sanctioned key operatives of the Quds Force that have secretly been working with Fidan for years. The information provided by US officials corroborated the findings of Turkish police, who had already identified the designated individuals as part of the Quds Force network during a criminal probe run by public prosecutors between 2011 and 2014.\n\nAccording to the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), Turkish nationals Hakkı Selçuk Şanlı, Abdulhamit Çelik and Seyyid Cemal Gündüz worked with IRGC official Behnam Shahriyari in an international oil smuggling and money laundering network that generated hundreds of millions of dollars on behalf of Iran and its proxy Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nThe US move rings alarm bells for Turkish spy master Fidan, a confidant of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan who was groomed in Shiite study circles during his youth and described as a high value asset by the IRGC.\n\nSummary of wiretaps from confidential Quds Force probe reveals how Hakkı Selçuk Şanlı said Turkish intelligence stopped monitoring him after Hakan Fidan, code-named Emin (trusted man) by Quds Force operatives, became the head of Turkish intelligence agency MIT:\n\nThe confidential Turkish probe into the Quds Force had already revealed Fidan’s secret contacts with Quds Force operatives including Şanlı and Shahriyari, the latter operating under the cover name of Sayed Ali Akber Mir Vakili. Shahriyari was part of an illegal cell based in Ankara working closely with Şanlı as well as with Faruk Koca, a former lawmaker, in communicating with Fidan.\n\nIn various intercepted communications, the cell members described Fidan as “Emin,” which means “trusted man” in Turkish. They used burner phones and changed the numbers used for communications every two or three months.\n\nŞanlı was arrested on May 13, 2000 and was sentenced to 12 years, six months in prison for involvement in terrorist plots targeting Turkish and US interests. The trial revealed how he and his associates helped set up the Quds Force network in the 1990s on the order of then-IRGC general Nasir Takipur. The group was designated as a terrorist group under the Turkish name of Tevhid Selam.\n\nBut he was freed in 2004 when the government of then-prime minister and now president Erdoğan pushed an amnesty bill through parliament, reducing sentences for some convicts. He was put to use again by his handlers after keeping a low profile for years and started running several operations including moving funds on behalf of the Quds Force, providing financial support for jailed Quds Force convicts and managing a recruitment and asset development program for Iranian intelligence in Ankara.\n\nThe launch of new operations and reactivating old assets by the Quds Force in Turkey came after a meeting of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Erdoğan in 2008. The Quds Force shifted into high gear after Erdoğan appointed Fidan, who had no experience in intelligence, as the head of intel agency MIT two years later.\n\nIn fact, the criminal probe into the Quds Force, listed under case file no.2011/762, revealed how Iranian and Turkish operatives working for the Quds Force were pleased with the appointment of Fidan as the head spy master.\n\nIn a wiretap dated May 24, 2013, Şanlı said he had been under surveillance by MIT after he got out of prison but that that stopped after Fidan took over the agency. What they did not know, however, was that Turkish police, under orders from veteran counterterrorism prosecutors, were actually looking into the Quds Force after receiving tips about increased illegal activities from local contacts in Turkey as well as terror plot alerts passed to Turkey by the US and Israel.\n\nThe wiretaps, surveillance records, documents and other evidence obtained during that probe exposed senior officials in the Erdoğan government as conspirators in facilitating IRGC Quds Force operations.\n\nLike Şanlı, his associate Çelik also has a long rap sheet in the Turkish criminal justice system. In 1996 Çelik was convicted of killing two opponents of the Iranian regime in Turkey and sentenced to 12 years, six months in prison, though he was released in 2004 as a result of an amnesty. He admitted in testimony in May 2000 as part of the Tevhid Selam probe that he had been trained for over two months in Iran to stage attacks in Turkey and conduct intelligence operations on behalf of Iran.\n\nGündüz, another associate of Şanlı, was also red flagged in the Turkish probe. Married to an Iranian woman, Gündüz has had contacts with Iranian intelligence since the 1980s and established businesses in both Iran and Turkey.\n\nThe IRGC Quds Force case in Turkey never went to trial because the Erdoğan government hushed it up in February 2014 after learning about the probe. The investigating prosecutor was sacked before he had a chance to secure detention warrants for the suspects or file an indictment. The suspects avoided the long arm of the law thanks to the intervention of Erdoğan, who apparently protected pro-Iranian assets and helped their Quds Force handlers escape from Turkey.\n\nIrfan Fidan, the new prosecutor, personally selected by Erdoğan to torpedo the Quds Force probe, dropped all the charges against the Iranian and Turkish nationals who were identified as part of Quds Force cells. Fidan also launched a new criminal case against everyone who was involved in the investigation into the Quds Force and ordered the detention of the police chiefs who uncovered the sophisticated Iranian network in Turkey. Fidan was rewarded by the Erdoğan government for squelching the probe and appointed as a member of the Constitutional Court in 2020.",
    "3 Key Reasons Why Turkey Is Keen To Reset Its Ties With India & Keep Its Pro-Pakistan, Pro-Kashmir Sentiments On Backburner": "Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar met his Turkish counterpart Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu in New York on September 21, just a few hours after Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in the United Nations General Assembly that it is “unfortunate” that India and Pakistan haven’t been able to establish peace 75 years after independence and hoped for “fair and permanent peace” in Kashmir would have been unthinkable few months ago.\n\nGoing by the past practices over the last three years, whenever Erdogan talks about Kashmir, Indian officials immediately meet top leaders of Greece or Cyprus, or Armenia, with whom Turkey has territorial disputes and human rights concerns.\n\nBut this time, the two foreign ministers meeting on the same day of Erdogan’s UN speech suggests that “The Pakistan factor” in India-Turkey relations is getting diluted, and both New Delhi and Ankara are recalibrating their policies toward one another in the face of the ongoing geopolitical changes.\n\nIt also seems that Turkey (Turkey officially changed its name to Türkiye in June 2022) is getting increasingly disenchanted with its strategic ally Pakistan.\n\nIt may be noted that soon after Article 370, which provided special status under the Indian constitution to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, was abrogated by the Indian government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in August 2019, Ankara has been raising the Kashmir issue in various forums.\n\nPresident Erdogan first broached the issue at the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in September 2019. Since then, he has repeatedly been talking about the Kashmir issue in the UNGA every year.\n\nIn 2020, the Turkish President said, “The Kashmir conflict, which is also key to the stability and peace of South Asia, is still a burning issue…We are in favor of solving this issue through dialogue within the framework of the United Nations resolutions, especially in line with the expectations of the people of Kashmir.”\n\nThis he did, knowing full well that the permanent five members of the UN Security Council and the world at large do not wish to interfere in a matter that they believe falls squarely within India’s domestic affairs.\n\nIn 2021, he repeated the same at the UNGA by saying, “We maintain our stance in favor of solving the ongoing problem in Kashmir for 74 years, through dialogue between the parties and within the framework of relevant United Nations resolutions.”\n\nIn fact, outside the United Nations, the Turkish President even did not hesitate to say that “India right now has become a country where massacres are widespread. What massacres? Massacres of Muslims. By who? Hindus.”\n\nIn his February 14, 2020, speech before a joint session of Pakistan’s parliament, Erdogan stated: We have never forgotten and will never forget the help, which the Pakistani people extended, by sharing their own bread during our War of Independence. And now, Kashmir is and will be the same for us. It was Çanakkale yesterday, and it is Kashmir today, [there is] no difference”.\n\nErdogan’s actions had invited India’s strong reactions. Prime Minister Modi countered by holding meetings with the president of Cyprus and the Prime Ministers of Armenia and Greece on the side-lines of the world body’s annual meetings.\n\nIndia reminded Turkey that unlike Ankara, which invaded and occupied part of the sovereign nation of Cyprus in 1974, New Delhi had not undertaken any such measures with regard to Kashmir.\n\nBesides, Modi later canceled his planned visit to Turkey in October 2019, and a lucrative $2.3 billion naval deal with a Turkish defense company was terminated. India also cut its other defense exports to Turkey, which included dual-use weaponry such as explosives and detonators.\n\nFrom then on, India also significantly reduced its imports from Turkey. And what was more, India entered into a defense agreement worth $40 million with Armenia, Turkey’s traditional rival in the region. It included four SWATHI weapon locating radars developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).\n\nIndia-Turkey Resetting Ties\n\nAgainst this background, this year’s speech at the UNGA by President Erdogan on Kashmir was very mild and neutral, experts say. “India and Pakistan, after having established their sovereignty and independence 75 years ago, still haven’t established peace and solidarity between one another. This is very unfortunate. We hope and pray that a fair and permanent peace and prosperity will be established in Kashmir,” Erdogan said.\n\nHe, unlike in the past, did not support Pakistan’s position that the Kashmir issue must be resolved under the dated UN Security Council resolution of the 1950s.\n\nDiplomatic sources point out that Erdogan’s mellowness on Kashmir was due to the “very constructive discussions” between him and Prime Minister Modi in Samarkand (Uzbekistan) during the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation(SCO) summit a week earlier.\n\nThey talked about the areas that interest both India and Turkey in terms of what they do bilaterally, in terms of how they can converge regionally, and also in terms of how their perspectives can meet more strongly with regard to developments all over the world.\n\nThree Reasons Why Ankara Is Resetting Its Ties With India\n\nOne, India has assumed the Chairmanship of the SCO, arguably based on the European Union model, for the year. And India will assume the Presidency of the highly influential G- 20 (big economies of the world) this December.\n\nTurkey, which is undergoing a big economic crisis with historically high inflation of 80 percent, has to be pragmatic, not ideological, so as to win more friends than foes.\n\nErdogan has said that Turkey wants to become a member of the SCO (now it is only a dialogue partner) and that he would pursue the idea at the SCO’s 2023 meeting in India.\n\nObviously, an anti-India posture will not help the matter for Turkey in the changed circumstances, particularly when despite the hitherto tense relations between them, India-Turkey bilateral trade has been fairly extensive. Trade is touching close to about $10 billion.\n\nIndia has awarded a consortium of Turkey’s top five leading shipyards, TAIS, the contract of naval shipbuilding worth $2.3 billion. A Turkish company, Savronik, has also completed a defense ministry-related project to build a tunnel in India’s Leh-Manali highway.\n\nIndians are now the third-largest Asian tourists in Turkey after China and Indonesia. Indian businesses, from food to technology, have been gradually expanding their presence in Turkey.\n\nTwo, Turkey perhaps realizes now its failure to emerge as the leader of the “Islamic grouping,” consisting of Pakistan, Malaysia, Iran, and Qatar, in an attempt to break Saudi Arabia and the UAE’s ideological supremacy within the Islamic world.\n\nFormer Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan was Erdogan’s biggest supporter. His ouster from office, followed by Pakistan’s acute financial dependence on Saudi Arabia, has virtually killed that idea.\n\nOn the other hand, a “pragmatic” Turkey is now normalizing relations with countries like Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. In February, Erdogan visited the UAE to bring relations back on track after diversions over Libya and the economic blockade against Qatar orchestrated by the UAE and Saudi Arabia.\n\nMost recently, Turkey re-established diplomatic relations with Israel after more than a decade of tensions that erupted in 2010 when Israeli commandos killed 10 Turkish activists aboard a Turkish aid vessel, the Mavi Marmara, attempting to break the Israeli maritime blockade of Gaza.\n\nThey have decided to appoint their respective ambassadors for the first time in four years. The two countries expelled each other’s ambassadors in 2018 over the killing of scores of protesters in Gaza by Israeli soldiers on the anniversary of the creation of the Israeli state. Turkey’s President had otherwise long criticized Israel’s treatment of Palestinians.\n\nAnd most importantly, in June, Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman traveled to Turkey to normalize ties after a Turkish court agreed to transfer the case relating to the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018 to Riyadh, removing a significant obstacle between the two countries.\n\nAfter the UAE, Saudi Arabia has now pledged to Turkey billions of dollars that will boost the Turkish economy ahead of an election next year. Erdogan has also reached out to other foes, including Egypt and Armenia, to mend relations.\n\nIncidentally, India now has excellent relations with all these countries – the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Israel, and Egypt. Turkey seems to have taken note of it while rebuilding ties with India.\n\nThree, it is becoming increasingly obvious that Turkey is getting disenchanted with Pakistan by and by, the most important factor behind its animosity towards India. The number of illegal Pakistani.\n\nThe number of illegal Pakistani immigrants in Turkey is proving to be a huge irritant in Ankara’s ties with Islamabad.\n\nAccording to Turkish authorities, there are between 3,000 and 6,000 illegal Pakistani nationals in detention at any given time, while many others stay in Turkey until they will find a way to go to Europe.\n\nBut what is disturbing the Turkish authorities is that the Pakistani immigrants are not respecting the country’s culture, particularly the women.\n\nIn April of this year, a Pakistani immigrant was caught sharing photographs and videos of Turkish women recorded on social media. Similar videos by other Pakistani immigrants also surfaced on social media, creating a furor in the Turkish population. “Pakistan Get Out” is, therefore, a big trend in Turkish social media.\n\nIntelligence reports claim that illegal Pakistan immigrants have also been found indulging in gang wars and other illegal crimes, including human and narco-trafficking and ransom kidnapping of tourists visiting Turkey.\n\nThis is a major challenge as Turkey is a favorite destination, and tourism is an important revenue-generating source for the economy. A recent incident (late April) was the kidnapping of a small group of Nepali tourists in Istanbul. Luckily, they were rescued by the Police, and six Pakistanis who had committed the crime and asked for a ransom of 10.000 Euros were arrested.\n\nConsidering all this, experts say that past setbacks notwithstanding, India-Turkey ties have a real chance of better days ahead.\n\nKabir Taneja, a Fellow at the Strategic Studies Programme of the Delhi-based think- tank Observer Research Foundation, seems to make sense when he says, “Using mechanisms such as the I2U2 grouping between India, the UAE, Israel, and the US, aimed toward regional economic dialogues as a springboard could provide new ideations and opportunities for dialogue with Ankara relating to trade and other economic opportunities via the Gulf, offering potentially small steps to test ground and intent prior to having more consequential dialogues addressing the more fundamental challenges that persist”.",
    "What Erdogan’s Unusual Economic Ideas Mean for Turkey": "Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nSign up for our Middle East newsletter and follow us @middleeast for news on the region. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is not the only politician who doesn’t like it when the country’s banks charge people relatively heavily to borrow money. What sets him apart is his unorthodox belief in low interest rates and determination to wrest control of monetary policy from central bankers. The result: A succession of benchmark rate cuts that has fueled runaway inflation and precipitated a collapse in the currency.\n\n1. What’s Erdogan’s beef with high interest rates?\n\nHe says that they slow economic growth and fuel inflation. The thesis has unnerved international investors for years. While the country’s spending and credit binge during the pandemic propelled growth, the economy has also suffered from double-digit inflation and unpredictable policy moves. He has also referred to Islamic proscriptions on usury as a basis for his policy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Are his arguments reasonable?\n\nThe point about weaker growth is. When a central bank increases rates, banks are less able to borrow to maintain mandatory reserves and tend to lend at their own elevated rates. This makes loans for businesses rarer and more expensive and so can slow the economy. But Erdogan’s second notion -- that elevated interest rates cause prices to rise -- contradicts conventional economic theories.\n\n3. What’s the basis of Erdogan’s theory?\n\nIt’s likely that it’s partly based on his experience running businesses, mostly in the food industry, before his career as a politician took off. Many Turkish companies borrow relatively heavily to cover operating expenses, making volatility in borrowing costs a source of uncertainty and rate hikes an added expense. In Erdogan’s view, higher rates result in higher prices because businesses have to pass on increased costs to their customers. This makes assumptions that orthodox economists challenge, namely that interest rates make up a significant part of companies’ costs and that producers have sufficient pricing power to impose their will on consumers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Who agrees with Erdogan?\n\nThe argument is based on a theory by Yale University economist Irving Fisher on the relationship between inflation, nominal interest rates and real interest rates. Critics of the neo-Fisherites say that even if their theory had merit, it wouldn’t apply to an economy like Turkey’s, which suffers from chronically high inflation and is reliant on foreign funding. That’s because cutting interest rates reduces the return on investing in Turkish assets, and the local currency tends to weaken when foreigners decide to put their money elsewhere. That increases the cost of imported goods in liras and results in higher prices, or more inflation.\n\n5. What has Erdogan done to put his views into action?\n\nMany central banks have raised borrowing costs to fight inflation after the pandemic. Turkey has gone the other way, cutting its benchmark interest rate by 7 percentage points to 12% in the 13 months to September. Over that period, the lira gradually weakened and inflation accelerated. The government increased the national minimum wage in December and July to limit the hit to households. This further inflamed prices, sending inflation to a 24-year high above 80% in August -- the fourth highest among 120 countries tracked by Bloomberg. Erdogan has held firm, saying what Turkey needs is more investment, production and exports, not higher interest rates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. What’s been the impact on financial markets?\n\nInterest rates on commercial debt began to diverge from benchmark rates as lenders balked at offering ever-cheaper loans when the supply of short-term central bank funding was in doubt. In response, monetary authorities imposed rules to force banks to bring their loan rates closer to the benchmark. They were also obliged to increase their holdings of lira-denominated, fixed-rate government debt. As a result, the cost of lira debt fell, while yields on Turkey’s junk-rated dollar bonds went in the opposite direction.\n\n7. What’s it done to the economy?\n\nHomes, cars and many essential goods became unaffordable for a swathe of Turkey’s 84 million population. Food inflation hit low earners, while the middle class saw a squeeze in living standards. On the flip side, economic growth outperformed Turkey’s peers and unemployment was relatively low due to an abundance of cheap labor. While the stock market rallied, keeping pace with inflation, bond investors have struggled to adjust to a world of 68% real negative yields. The lira hit an all-time low against the dollar in September, even though the central bank has spent an estimated $75 billion to prop up the currency this year, according to calculations by Bloomberg Economics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Could Erdogan reverse course?\n\nErdogan has signaled he’ll do whatever it takes to keep his low-rate policy intact. Finance Minister Nureddin Nebati told investors frustrated by low bond yields they can find good returns in Turkish stocks. With elections looming in 2023, Erdogan is wary of changing course and risking a blowout in borrowing rates that could inflict further pain on consumers. To shore up popular support, he announced a $50 billion project to increase home ownership, introduced a cap on rents, erased some student loans and promised another big minimum wage hike. He’s aware the economy is his biggest challenge, and economists aren’t ruling out a policy rethink after the elections.\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com\n\n©2022 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

Then our esteemed fellow media printed headlines like 'The Conqueror of Europe' and wrote of a 'European Turkey'.

    "Israel appoints ambassador to Turkey for first time since 2018": "Appointment of Irit Lillian is the latest move in the recent rapprochement between the two countries.\n\nIsrael will have an ambassador in Turkey for the first time in four years, the latest step in warming relations between the two countries following a years-long rift.\n\nIrit Lillian, a senior diplomat who has been in charge of the Israeli embassy in Ankara for the last two years, will serve as the ambassador, Israel’s foreign ministry announced on Monday.\n\nIn 2018, Turkey withdrew its ambassador from Israel and ordered Israel’s ambassador to leave in protest at Israel’s killing of dozens of Palestinians in protests along the Gaza border.\n\nOnce-warm relations began to deteriorate after the election of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, an outspoken critic of Israel’s treatment of the Palestinians, as prime minister in 2003.\n\nThe now Turkish president famously berated ex-Israeli prime minister Shimon Peres while on stage at the World Economic Forum at Davos in 2009.\n\nTensions peaked in 2010 when Israeli forces stormed a Turkish ship that broke through an Israeli blockade to deliver humanitarian aid to the Hamas-administered Gaza Strip.

    "The roots of Turkey's balancing act with Russia on Ukraine": "Often exasperating to Western powers, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan is performing a difficult balancing act ultimately designed to help him retain power in the 2023 elections despite a deeply troubled economy.\n\nJust a few days before reports came out about the territorial gains of the Ukrainian army in the country’s northeast region, Erdogan had warned the West not to “underestimate Russia” and criticized its “provocation-based policy” toward Putin.\n\nIt was one of several previous episodes where Turkey surprised its watchers, wherever they might stand on the war in Ukraine.\n\nI have given more than a dozen interviews and lectures on Turkey’s foreign policy in Ukraine since the start of Putin’s “special military operation” in February 2022. Two questions came up in nearly every single one of them. The first was whether Turkey was effectively on both sides of the war in Ukraine. The second asked if Turkey’s positioning was an asset or liability for the Western alliance, especially in the context of NATO’s support for Ukraine. The answer to the first question is a simple yes. The second, however, needs a lot more elaboration.\n\nTurkey (or Türkiye, as the country now demands to be called) stands at a key juncture between the West and Russia. This position, both politically and geographically, has fundamentally shaped its Ukraine policy.\n\nOn the one hand, Turkey is a U.S. ally and a longstanding and critical member of NATO as the alliance’s second largest troop contributor. The country served key roles in the NATO operations in Kosovo and Afghanistan. Even though it was not taken up, Turkey had also offered to operate the Kabul airport after Washington’s withdrawal from Afghanistan last summer. And even though its relations with the United States have strained more than quite a bit over the last decade, Turkey still considers itself a U.S. ally and has no intentions to sever ties.\n\nOn the other hand, Turkey maintains strong relations with Russia especially in terms of trade. The country is one of the biggest buyers of Russian natural gas and exports food products and chemicals worth billions of dollars. Turkey also attracts millions of Russian tourists each year with its affordable beach resorts and visa-free travel regime with its Black Sea neighbor. Most importantly, the two countries have forged increasingly critical security and defense relationships in the last few years. The most critical of these include their military coordination in Syria and, of course, Turkey’s controversial purchase of the Russian S-400 air defense system in 2017.\n\nThat is quite some baggage. And Turkey has been maintaining a balancing act in Ukraine precisely because of it.\n\nFor instance, Turkey declared the “special military operation” in Ukraine a “war” soon after its onset. Doing so, Ankara exercised its Montreux Convention rights to close the straits, the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles, to outbound Russian battleships. Ankara also provided the now infamous Bayraktar TB2 drones to Ukraine early on in the conflict, and once again more recently. The drones helped Ukraine achieve some early tactical gains that bolstered morale when it was most needed.\n\nYet, unlike its Western allies, Turkey did not close its airspace to Russian aircraft, nor did it impose any economic sanctions on Russia. In fact, the country has doubled its gas imports from Russia and monetized its visa-free travel regime at a time when it has become increasingly difficult for Russians to get Schengen visas for Europe.\n\nClearly, Turkey is on both sides of the war. But is its position an asset or liability for the West?\n\nThere are two ways to answer that question. Some would argue that Turkey’s positioning is an asset not just for the West but for the developing world as well. Ankara was able to negotiate the deal that lifted the Odessa port blockade and allowed the shipment of Ukrainian grain, potentially mitigating a global food crisis. Turkey was able to mediate between Ukraine and Russia precisely because it has chosen to hedge its bets on both sides of the conflict. Further, Turkey’s position may also have played some role in preventing further escalation between NATO and Russia, such as stalling Finland and Sweden’s NATO bids earlier this spring.\n\nOthers would certainly argue, however, that Turkey has proven to be an unpredictable ally that undermines the West’s determination to stand against Russian aggression. After all, one man’s balancing act is another’s lack of commitment. Given the importance of credibility in international relations, especially for organizations of democratic states like NATO, Turkey’s “half-hearted” approach to the war in Ukraine can be considered a liability for NATO’s resolve and its ability to deter Russia in the future, further destabilizing the region.\n\nSo what is Erdogan’s endgame?\n\nIt has become impossible to understand Turkey’s foreign policy, including its Ukraine policy, without understanding the country’s domestic politics and Erdogan’s future in it.\n\nNational elections in Turkey are coming up in 2023, which will also mark the republic’s centennial. The race has enormous political and symbolic significance for Erdogan and his AKP. After having lost the mayorships of Turkey’s three largest cities to opposition candidates in 2018, Erdogan has vowed to renew his and his party’s mandate next year. That looks like an increasingly difficult challenge, however, given the country’s grim economic outlook. Turkey’s currency, the lira, has lost more than half of its value against the dollar since 2021. Interest rates remain shockingly low (it’s personal for Erdogan) and prices have shot up nearly 100 percent in major cities like Istanbul. The opposition bloc is energetic and hopeful even though they have yet to decide on their presidential candidate.\n\nPerhaps for the first time, electoral defeat is a very likely outcome for Erdogan next year. Turkey’s position in Ukraine is directly tethered to his political future. He cannot turn his back to Russia and send the country’s economy into a tailspin. Instead, he pursues this difficult balancing act that he packages as Turkey’s “strategic autonomy” in foreign policy while scoring additional points by mediating high-profile negotiations between the warring parties. “Turkey doesn’t take orders from others; we are a key actor in the region and the makers of our own foreign policy” is a powerful and compelling message that attracts voters from every corner of Turkish society. He needs popular support more than ever, and his Ukraine policy might just help him get it.",
    "Erdogan was different at the UN this time": "In the spring of 2006, for one of my first jobs in journalism, I worked as a reporting intern for a wire service at the UN headquarters in New York. Two days a week I marched into the sleek Secretariat building looming over the East River, eager to cover the day’s most urgent issues – the Darfur crisis, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, global hunger and more.\n\nI soon discovered that diplomats were much better at their jobs than I had imagined. They would look me dead in the eye and respond to my questions with intelligence and apparent insight. Yet, once I had typed up the interview and dropped it into my article, I would realise they had simply used different words to express sentiments that had been said a hundred times before.\n\nReporting at the UN was like panning for gold: high hopes inevitably crumbled as the sifting turned up only sand. Amid the flurry of flashbulbs, it turned out, very little of substance occurred. By the time I left, I viewed the UN as little more than the world’s pre-eminent public relations platform.\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Liz Truss holds a bilateral meeting with Turkey's President Erdogan at the Turkey Mission Building in New York during the 77th UN General Assembly, on September 21. Pool photo via AP\n\nThis might explain why Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has over the years shown a knack for grabbing the world’s attention on his autumnal visits to Turtle Bay. In his first UN General Assembly speech in 2005, he declared terrorism “the enemy of humankind” and launched the Alliance of Civilisations initiative with Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Spain’s then prime minister, to unite international counter-extremism efforts.\n\nIn 2014, Mr Erdogan invoked, for the first time on the global stage, the phrase that has since become his refrain on the UN Security Council’s five permanent members. “I should emphasise that the world is bigger than five,” he said.\n\nIn 2016, he denounced Europe’s “degrading treatment” of a wave of newly arrived, mostly Arab refugees and, just weeks after a failed coup had shaken Turkey, urged the world to take measures against his government’s main suspect, the Gulen movement.\n\nIn 2019, he proposed a controversial safe zone in northern Syria and defended the rights of Palestinians. “Where are the borders of the state of Israel?” he wondered, denouncing Israeli annexations as illegitimate.\n\nQuote Absent was the fire of earlier UN speeches. He called for peace in Syria but refrained from criticising the EU and US\n\nLast year, Mr Erdogan handed out copies of his new book, urging reform at the UN and other international bodies, and inaugurated the $300 million Turkish House. He described Turkey’s new consulate and permanent UN mission – 17 metres taller than Secretariat, just across the street – as an expression of his nation’s growing influence.\n\nThis year, in contrast, Mr Erdogan seemed more subdued, seeking to highlight his country’s positive role in world affairs. Citing the need for food security in the Horn of Africa and peace talks in Ukraine, he said Turkey had endeavoured “to be part of the solution” around the world.\n\nHe’s half right, as we’re in the midst of another Tale-of-Two-Cities moment for Mr Erdogan. At home he may be less well liked than he’s been since his last days as Istanbul mayor, a quarter-century ago. And tensions with Greece, Turkey’s Aegean neighbour, have spiked in recent weeks as the two have traded insults and accusations.\n\nBut farther abroad, despite lingering tensions with the US and EU, Turkey has made real diplomatic gains, including renewed ties with Gulf powers, Israel and Egypt. In New York, Mr Erdogan held a meeting with Israeli Prime Minster Yair Lapid, marking the first time since the George W Bush presidency that an Israeli prime minister met a Turkish president.\n\nMore from David Lepeska What 'Devil Village' tells us about the future of the Ukraine war\n\nHowever troubling Mr Erdogan’s threats to “open the gates” of migration have been, it’s Turkey – not Greece, as top EU officials have asserted – that has served as Europe’s refugee shield, hosting 4-5 million foreigners for nearly a decade and keeping them out of the EU.\n\nAlso, even as Turkey has strengthened ties with Azerbaijan, potentially providing Europe with a much-needed alternative to Russian natural gas, Ankara has inched toward normalisation with historic rival Armenia and the opening of their long-closed border.\n\nLast but not least is Ukraine. Ankara’s western and Nato allies have been largely unable to criticise its continued friendly relations with Moscow because of how it has leveraged them. With more than 40 countries at risk of famine in late summer, Turkey played a crucial role in bringing Ukraine and Russia to agree on a plan to release millions of tonnes of grain from Ukrainian ports.\n\nSince March, Ankara has spearheaded efforts to bring Ukraine and Russia to the negotiating table. “There will be no losers in a fair peace process,” Mr Erdogan told the UN General Assembly, calling for support of Turkey’s diplomacy.\n\nAbsent was the fire of earlier UN speeches. He called for peace in Syria but refrained from criticising the EU and US for their unwillingness to help solve the refugee issue. He also stayed his hand on Moscow’s military mobilisation, even as reports emerged that four of five military summons in Russian-occupied Crimea have gone to Crimean Tatars – a persecuted Turkic-Muslim minority Mr Erdogan regularly defends.\n\nHis most notable activity in New York was an afternoon stroll in Central Park. He met a local rabbi, sat for photos with parents and their children, and from one passerby, received a hearty \"thank you\" on Ukraine, for the drones, the grain deal and “helping to make Nato stronger”.\n\nThe President’s communications team released a seven-minute video of the park visit, which some critics said had been staged. This is understandable; in Turkey, Mr Erdogan does not stroll through parks or chat with everyday citizens. But it all seemed real enough.\n\nErdogan receives expressions of deep gratitude from a passerby in Central Park, in an impromptu exchange that does not look staged at all. https://t.co/EJBoBs0LFP — Paul T. Levin (@PaulTLevin) September 19, 2022\n\nTurkey’s lira hit yet another record low last week, at 18.42 to the dollar, and the governing AKP has been trailing in polls for months. With elections looming next year, the Central Park video was probably an attempt to humanise Mr Erdogan, to present a warmer leader who is also comfortable in the world.\n\nMaybe after years of relishing his moment in the spotlight, Mr Erdogan has come to share my view that the UN is mostly sound and fury. Perhaps he decided to take a break and enjoy his time in the Big Apple, walk in the park, revel in recent successes, speak in the third person.\n\nA Turkish reporter at the UN asked if he hoped to meet US President Joe Biden and he shook his head. “He is Biden,” Turkey’s leader responded with a grin. “I’m Erdogan.”",
    "Turkey’s poultry market continues to grow": "The poultry sector is one of Turkey’s most well-integrated. In 2023, chicken meat production in Turkey is estimated to increase 9%, consumption by 5%, and exports by 15%.\n\nThe poultry sector, of which chicken meat accounts for 99% of total production, is the main source of protein in the country. The sector faces continuing challenges, including high production costs, a heavy dependency on foreign countries for input supplies, lower per capita consumption levels, and issues with exports due to political and economic turmoil in neighbouring countries.\n\nChicken meat production in Turkey\n\nIn 2021, Turkey produced 2.25 mmt of chicken meat, and 19.3 billion eggs, which is 2.4% less than the previous year due to high feed prices and the culling of flocks after the closure of the Iraq export market, which re-opened for Turkish eggs as of mid-2022.\n\nIn 2022, despite increasing feed prices, chicken meat production in Turkey is estimated to increase 10% to 2.46 mmt, which is primarily due to a more efficient supply of hatching eggs and day-old chicks, and stronger foreign demand. In 2022, imports of breeding stock increased 12%, and while most were used locally, 2% of the increase was re-exported as hatching eggs to Iraq and Russia.\n\nIn 2023, chicken meat production in Turkey is estimated to increase 9% to 2.68 mmt due to relatively stable export demand and slightly higher domestic consumption expected.\n\nFeed, primarily corn and soybeans\n\nIn 2021, Turkey produced 5.5 mmt of broiler feed and 3.7 mmt of feed for layers. The main ingredients used in local broiler feed rations are corn and soybeans. While Turkey grows both crops, a sizeable portion is imported to meet demand.\n\nForest fires, market prices and exports hamper growth in chicken consumption\n\nIn 2023, chicken meat consumption is forecast at 1.7 mmt which is 5% higher than 2022. In 2022, consumption is forecast at 1.6 mmt, which is lower than 2021 due to increasing exports, high market prices, and less barbecuing due to restrictions after major forest fires in 2021 and the increasing price of coal. In 2021, chicken meat consumption was similar to 2020 levels due to a lack of growth because of Covid-19 measures such as curfews in the spring and movement restrictions in the summer.\n\nALSO READ: The soybean situation: 2021 and beyond\n\nThe soybean crop is currently critical for sustaining the current human population, but also a crop that brings with it huge sustainability concerns. All About Feed takes an in-depth look at soybean production for livestock feed in South America and beyond. Read more…\n\nA major transshipment point for poultry trade\n\nWhile Turkey does not import chicken meat for domestic consumption, the country serves as a major transshipment point to the Middle East, mostly Iraq (80%) and Syria (20%). Turkey does, however, import hatching eggs, mostly from the UK, the US, and Canada, and day-old chicks from Germany, the UK, and the US.\n\nChicken meat a among top animal export products\n\nPoultry meat is among the top-3 exported animal products in Turkey, along with milk cream and seabass. Restrictions by importing countries due to HPAI cases in Turkey is one of the main negative factors affecting the Turkish poultry export market, as well as political and economic turmoil in neighbouring countries, which causes uncertainty for exporters making contracts with importing companies.\n\nIn 2021, Turkey exported 26% of its total poultry production (98.2% broiler meat; 1.8% turkey meat) with chicken meat exports (excluding paws) reaching 563,274 mt (valued at US$857 million). In 2022, chicken meat exports are estimated to reach 860,000 mt, which is 52% more than 2021 due to strong export demand, particularly from Iraq and Iran (until the market closure in May 2022). In 2023, Turkish chicken meat exports are estimated to increase by 15% to 989,000 mt.\n\nIn terms of chicken paws, China is a large export market for Turkey, along with Uzbekistan, Thailand, Syria, and Iraq.\n\n*This information in the article has been extracted from a USDA GAINS report.",

    "Turkey strikes Syria regime outpost, kills three: War monitor": "Turkish raids in northern Syria on Sunday struck outposts operated by the Syrian army and Kurdish-led forces, killing three, a Britain-based war monitor said.\n\nThe raids near the Kurdish-held border town of Kobane targeted positions of the Syrian army and the Syrian Democratic Forces, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe three casualties were wearing Syrian army uniform, according to the monitor.\n\nFor all the latest headlines follow our Google News channel online or via the app.\n\nSeveral other fighters were wounded, some in critical condition, according to the Observatory, which relies on a wide network of sources inside Syria.\n\nThe strikes were preceded by cross-border shelling from near Kobane against Turkish forces, according to the monitor.\n\nLast month, the Syrian government said it would respond to direct attacks by Turkey against its forces.\n\nThe warning came after a Turkish raid on a regime outpost near Kobane killed at least three troops in mid-August, according to the official SANA news agency.\n\nTurkey has launched a series of cross-border offensives targeting Kurdish forces and the ISIS terrorist group since 2016, but such operations have rarely resulted in the killing of Syrian regime fighters.\n\nAnkara has stepped up its attacks in Kurdish-controlled areas of Syria since a July 19 summit with Iran and Russia failed to green-light a fresh offensive against Kurdish fighters viewed by Ankara as terrorists.\n\nRegime forces have deployed in areas controlled by Kurdish fighters near the border with Turkey as part of agreements intended to stem a fresh Turkish operation.\n\nLast week, the UN’s Independent Commission of Inquiry on Syria said that “another Turkish ground operation” remains a threat in Syria’s north, amid “continued mobilization and fighting” between Turkish and Turkish-backed forces and Kurdish-led opponents.\n\n“Syria cannot afford a return to larger-scale fighting, but that is where it may be heading,” warned Paolo Pinheiro, the head of the commission.\n\nRead more:\n\nIsrael’s Lapid, Turkey’s Erdogan to meet during UN General Assembly: Lapid’s office\n\nKurdish forces end 3-month operation against ISIS supporters in Syria’s al-Hol camp\n\nIsrael attacks Damascus airport, five soldiers killed: Syria ministry",
    "SDF receives more than 100 civilians forcibly deported from Turkey": "The SDF has received more than 100 civilians, including elders, women, and children, in areas close to the front lines in the village of Al-TirwazIya, in the eastern countryside of Raqqa. The 100 civilians had been forcibly deported from the refugee camps located in the Turkish Occupying State.\n\nUpon their arrival in their areas, the SDF provided them with relief assistance and first aid. They were exhausted and stranded. Moreover, some of them were urgently hospitalized since they were tortured by the Turkish police.\n\nOne of the forcibly deported men said, “While I was on my way to work, suddenly the Turkish police arrested me without any accusation. I was subjected to severe torture at the police station, and then they transferred me to a prison-like camp in the desert surrounded by a fence with tight security.”\n\nHe added, “They promised the Syrians to grant them citizenship cards, but they were lying. Turkey treated us badly, and no one defended us. The Turkish police force Syrian refugees to sign a deportation document by which the deportee becomes banned from entering Turkish territory for five years.”\n\nAnother deportee said, “The Turkish army tortured us brutally when we were arrested at the border, some of us fainted due to brutal torture.”\n\nThese criminal practices by the Turkish Occupying State attest to its inhuman nature.",
    "Turkey-Greece Tensions Could Disrupt NATO Unity, Experts Warn": "Turkey and Greece, both NATO members, have been at loggerheads for decades over territorial and airspace claims in and over the Aegean Sea. As the historic rivals escalate their war of words, analysts warn about the risk of current tension spilling into NATO business at a time when there is a need to focus on unity against Russia amid its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe latest spat began when Turkey accused its neighbor of locking onto Turkish fighter jets with its Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missile systems deployed on the island of Crete. Ankara also said Greek pilots placed Turkish aircraft under a radar lock over the Eastern Mediterranean during a NATO mission last month.\n\nAthens dismissed Turkish claims and accused the country of violating its airspace.\n\nAs both countries lodged complaints with NATO about the incidents, the deletion of a tweet by NATO Allied Land Command (LANDCOM) congratulating Turkey on its Victory Day, following a demarche by Greece, caused fury in Ankara.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan doubled down when he spoke earlier this week at Teknofest, an event dubbed as Turkey’s biggest aviation and aerospace festival.\n\n“Look at history. If you cross the line any further, there will be a heavy price to pay. Don’t forget Izmir,” he said, alluding to a defeat of occupying Greek forces in the western city in 1922.\n\nHe echoed those words earlier this week, warning “Turkey could come all of a sudden one night.”\n\nHis remarks were perceived by Greek officials as threats, suggesting Turkey could take military action against the Aegean Sea islands. Athens says it is ready to defend its sovereignty.\n\nGreek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias asked NATO, European Union partners and the United Nations to formally condemn what he described as “outrageous and increasingly aggressive talk by Turkish officials” in letters addressed to three international bodies, copies of which were seen by The Associated Press.\n\nIn a statement sent to VOA, a State Department representative called on the two allies to resolve their differences diplomatically.\n\nPointing to the Russian invasion in Ukraine, Washington said statements that could raise tensions between NATO allies are “particularly unhelpful,” adding “Greece’s sovereignty over the islands is not in question.”\n\nThe Pentagon did not comment on Turkish claims that Greece locked its S-300 surface-to-air missiles onto Turkey’s jets last week but said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin emphasized the need to reduce tensions in the Aegean through constructive dialogue during his previous talks with Turkish and Greek counterparts.\n\nPossibility of war\n\n\n\nDeep-rooted friction brought Turkey and Greece almost to the point of war three times in the last 50 years.\n\nAnalysts speaking to VOA say they don’t see a resolution any time soon, noting the troubled history of bilateral relations and the “tight politics” in the two nations’ capitals.\n\n“It will take a mediator who has the skill and some leverage to be able to come up with something that these two nations can agree with. But I don’t see that on the horizon,” said Jim Townsend, former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense on European and NATO policy. Townsend is currently an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security Transatlantic Security Program.\n\nPhilip Breedlove, a retired U.S. Air Force general who served as NATO supreme allied commander from 2013 to 2016, said the long-standing problems between Turkey and Greece rise and fall over time.\n\n“The leadership in Turkey is pushing the country in certain directions that have caused these tensions to rise once again as they have over the years,” the former top NATO commander said in a phone interview with VOA on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nBreedlove, who is now a senior fellow with the Middle East Institute, said NATO and the United States have managed similar tensions in the past and the alliance is still up to the task.\n\nConcerns about disrupting NATO unity\n\nThe recent spat between Turkey and Greece takes place as NATO is focusing on displaying a united front against Russia in the face of its invasion in Ukraine.\n\n\n\nExperts are worried that if the tension escalates to the point of hostilities, Russian President Vladimir Putin can take advantage.\n\n\n\n“Whatever little cracks can appear in European unity, Putin can make them even larger and in fact split the rock. So, it not only undercuts European unity but also can spill over into NATO councils if one or the other country uses NATO as a weapon to hurt the other,” Townsend said.\n\n\n\nHe warned that those cracks can be exploited by Moscow as winter approaches; Russia has already cut back on its gas exports to Europe.\n\nElection dynamics\n\nTurkey and Greece will both head to the polls for crucial elections next year.\n\nTurkish President Erdogan is said to be facing a major challenge to his 20-year rule amid the country’s economic woes and immigration problems.\n\nGreek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, elected in 2019, reportedly suffered a popularity loss to some degree because of rising energy prices partly driven by the war in Ukraine.\n\n“Rhetoric on both sides has always been part of the problem and it’s something that doesn’t help things,” said Townsend.\n\nBreedlove agrees. He believes some of this is “playing to an internal audience.”\n\nBalancing act\n\nThe United States is known to have maintained a balance between regional rivals Turkey and Greece, which it says are both important NATO allies.\n\nAthens and Washington extended a bilateral military agreement for five years and the deal was ratified by the Greek parliament in the summer, days before the Greek prime minister’s visit to Washington in mid-May. The deal gives the U.S. more military access to bases in Greece.\n\nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley met with his Greek counterpart, Konstantinos Floros, at the Pentagon in July. “The military leaders discussed mutual items of interest,” said a statement from his office.\n\nThat visit was followed by Greek Defense Minister Nikolaos Panagiotopoulos’ visit to the Pentagon July 18 to meet with Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. The two discussed the “growing defense partnership between the United States and Greece and the close cooperation on basing, [and] defense modernization,” according to a statement from the Pentagon.\n\nThey also discussed “the need to reduce tensions in the Aegean through constructive dialogue.”\n\nAustin spoke with his Turkish counterpart, Hulusi Akar, July 25, discussing “the need for continued efforts to reduce tensions in the Aegean through constructive dialogue.”\n\nTurkish and Greek defense requests\n\nGreece is seeking to acquire F-35 fighter jets from the United States. The country formally requested the fighter jets in June.\n\nTurkey was kicked out of the F-35 program because of its purchase of an advanced S-400 missile system from Russia. Ankara wants to buy F-16s and modernization kits from Washington. U.S. weapons sales to foreign countries are subject to congressional approval.\n\nAnalysts argue that Turkey’s decision to buy the Russian S-400 system was a huge blow to defense cooperation between Washington and Ankara, which they say has traditionally been very strong.\n\nTownsend, who spent 30 years at the Pentagon working on Turkey issues, tells VOA that he “mourns the loss of [the] close working relationship with Turkey,” hoping it can be restored again.\n\nHe is hopeful that the United States will be able to provide the F-16s requested by Turkey, saying he thinks the administration — working with Congress — will be able to allow that transfer to happen.\n\nRetired U.S. Air Force General Breedlove maintains the same hope.\n\nFocusing on ‘common threat’\n\nThe former NATO commander argues that Turkey made some security decisions that aligned it more closely with “NATO’s enemy,” in reference to its S-400 purchase from Russia, which was identified as the most significant and direct threat to the allies’ security in NATO’s strategic concept document.\n\n“The enemy is not Greece versus Turkey and Turkey versus Greece. It is NATO versus Russia. I would want Turkey to have that if they can't have the F-35. We need to understand who the enemy is,” Breedlove tells VOA.\n\nHe said the United States would want to move forward with Turkey because it is an incredibly important part of the NATO alliance despite recent lows in the relationship, adding he cannot speak to the policy of the current U.S. government.\n\nBut he also acknowledged that “Greece is a little more aligned with where America wants to go in the area,” saying Washington would want to have the same kind of relationship with Turkey.\n\nHe calls on the United States and Turkey to focus on how they can bring back the same level of cooperation rather than growing apart.\n\nErdogan’s criticism of the West’s Russia policy\n\nMeanwhile, Erdogan has recently accused Western nations of provoking Russia, without naming any.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference in Serbia, he suggested the “West’s policy on Russia was based on provocations.”\n\nHe vowed to continue Turkey’s balancing policy between Russia and Ukraine, adding Russia is not a country that one can underestimate.\n\n“Russia has cut off natural gas now. Prices in Europe have skyrocketed. Everyone now broods on how they will get through this winter,” Erdogan said.\n\nTurkey supplies Ukraine with combat drones, which are used by Kyiv to destroy Russian targets in the conflict.\n\nAnkara also played a role with the United Nations as a mediator to secure the deal that allowed grain exports to resume from the ports in Ukraine. But it has not joined the Western sanctions against Russia.\n\nThis story originated in VOA’s Turkish Service. The service's Dilge Timocin contributed."
