    "Colombia and Venezuela: Country Program Overview - Colombia": "Work in Colombia\n\nMedGlobal has been operating in Colombia since 2019. Our immediate goal was to provide primary health care services to Venezuelan migrants. We attempted to play a part in the response to the extra burden imposed by this diaspora.\n\nTo provide primary and specialty care, MedGlobal has hired local health staff and has hosted 73 international medical volunteers from a variety of medical specialties such as internal medicine, pediatrics, family medicine, emergency medicine, etc., who deployed to help.\n\nIn Cúcuta, Norte de Santander Department, MedGlobal ran a primary care clinic for 2.5 years in the Comuneros neighborhood. This was chosen because the “barrio” (neighborhood) was home to a large number of Venezuelan migrants. Primary care services to children and adults and prenatal care services were among the services provided in this site.\n\nTo serve Venezuelan migrants as well as Colombian IDPs with little to no access to health care, MedGlobal conducted five medical brigades in the El Talento neighborhood, located on the outskirts of Cúcuta. These medical brigades included local staff as well as international medical volunteers, who provided care of acute intermittent illnesses as well as care of non-communicable diseases such as hypertension, asthma, and diabetes, plus COVID-19 testing and a COVID-19 immunization clinic.\n\nMedGlobal was invited to participate in an ambitious government program to serve a large group of Venezuelan migrants called Los Caminantes (the walkers). They are Venezuelan migrants and refugees who leave Venezuela, traveling to other countries in the region by foot. Los Patios Migration Center is the first of six way stations along Los Caminantes’ route from Cúcuta to Bogota. MedGlobal was asked to serve as the medical presence at Los Patios.\n\nThe clinic provides Los Caminantes with free, first-contact medical services including acute care, obstetrics and gynecology, psychosocial support services, laboratory services, and medications. The clinic also offers COVID-19 rapid testing and COVID-19 vaccination. Through April 2022, MedGlobal has provided more than 7,600 health services in Los Patios.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, MedGlobal provided a variety of services in Cúcuta and in Bogota. Thousands of Venezuelan migrant and refugee families attempted to return to Venezuela amidst economic instability, creating a public health crisis in the border regions. Migrants were stuck at the border creating an overcrowded area. Tents were established to help mitigate the situation. MedGlobal and its partners began providing health services at a shelter established at the Tienditas Bridge in Cúcuta, providing health screenings and first aid to migrants and refugees. MedGlobal also distributed a range of critically needed supplies and equipment in Cúcuta, including 3 portable ventilators, to the new COVID-19 treatment center at Erasmo Meoz Hospital and hygiene kits for the local community. MedGlobal provided three medical staff to collaborate with the local health system in COVID-19 case surveillance.\n\nTo help build capacity at the border, MedGlobal began a training program for Point of Care Ultrasound. We donated the hardware, and we also provide on-going consultation to Venezuelan physician-trainees facing any difficult diagnostic case. We do this via telemedicine consultations as well as intermittent webinars.",
    "Venezuela-Colombia border reopens to trade as tensions ease": "People along the shared border hope the reopening of border crossings to cargo will boost the economy after a years-long closure.\n\nTrucks loaded with aluminum and medications have crossed a bridge linking Colombia and Venezuela for the first time in seven years, as the neighbouring countries continue to mend relations after years of political conflict.\n\nThe border reopening – which will see goods like coal, toilet paper and fruit moved through crossings between the Colombian city of Cucuta and the Venezuelan state of Tachira – was a key campaign promise of Colombia’s new left-wing President Gustavo Petro.\n\nPetro arrived at Simon Bolivar International Bridge, one of the main crossings that connects the two countries, for a ceremony on Monday morning, Al Jazeera’s Alessandro Rampietti reported from the bridge.\n\n“Obviously this means a lot symbolically; symbolically [it] shows the end of this … sort of cold war that has existed between Colombia and Venezuela for a number of years now,” Rampietti said, adding that many hope the resumption of trade will improve the economic situation in the area.\n\n“We’ve seen the first trucks crossing with cargo from Venezuela into Colombia, and vice-versa. There is great expectation for what this will mean for this region, after years of icy relationships, after years of very, very restricted economic activity, and in a situation where much of the goods that moved through this border did so illegally.”\n\nThe reopening comes weeks after Petro and his Venezuelan counterpart President Nicolas Maduro announced that they planned to restore diplomatic relations, which were severed in 2019.\n\nPetro has said he will recognise Maduro and work with the Venezuelan government on several issues, including fighting rebel groups along the porous border between the nations.\n\n“May the opening of the border usher in prosperity for Colombia, Venezuela and all of the Americas,” Petro tweeted on Monday. Maduro also wrote on Twitter that the reopening marked the beginning of a new stage in bilateral ties based on “brotherhood, respect and peace”.\n\nCommercial flights between the countries will also resume soon, potentially enabling billions of dollars in trade after years of icy bilateral relations and heavily-restricted economic ties. Caracas and Bogota also have announced intentions to restore military relations.\n\nOn Monday, four trucks from company Transporte Condor were loaded with toilet paper, plastic glasses, medical supplies and textiles to cross early from Cucuta. The goods, weighing 120 tonnes, are valued at some $80,000, manager Diego Bohorquez said.\n\nThe border has already been opened to pedestrians, with many Venezuelans crossing to buy basic goods amid their country’s long-running economic crisis. Cargo transport had previously only been allowed through one northern crossing.\n\nThe frontier has long been home to dozens of irregular crossings, fuel and food smuggling and drug trafficking. And the closures have not ended the transportation of various goods – including some over dirt roads by armed groups – into Venezuela. Criminal groups also have used the roads for trafficking operations.\n\nMerchants on both sides of the 2,219km (1,379-mile) border have been eagerly awaiting the normalisation since Petro’s June election, hopeful open trade will allow them access to raw materials and new customers.\n\nTrade between the two countries could total more than $600m this year, the Colombian government has said. It totalled $7bn in 2008, before Venezuela’s then-president Hugo Chavez froze it to protest a Bogota-Washington military deal.\n\nPeople along the border have expressed the hope that the reopening will bring in much-needed commerce to the region.\n\n“It will be something very positive for both countries, Colombia and Venezuela,” said Michael, a Venezuelan man who only gave The Associated Press his first name, who was crossing the Simon Bolivar bridge between the two countries on Sunday.\n\n“The borders will open, there will be more commerce. And I hope that in a few months, it will also open for private cars. There will be more jobs.”\n\nIn 2015, the smuggling of cheap, subsidised goods from Venezuela into Colombia skyrocketed. This was followed by an incident where three Venezuelan soldiers were killed, apparently by smugglers, after which Maduro ordered the closure of legal crossing points.\n\nIn 2019, Caracas broke off relations with Bogota after Venezuelan opposition activists tried to send aid trucks from Colombia. Maduro’s government said it was a front for an attempted coup.\n\nColombia has previously accused Venezuela of offering assistance and shelter to armed groups in the border region, a claim bolstered by a report by Human Rights Watch in March.",
    "Can Petro Pull Off ‘Total Peace’ in Colombia?": "Gustavo Petro might be only six weeks into his presidency, but he hasn’t lost any time defining his top priority. “I will work to achieve true and definitive peace. Like no one else, like never before,” he pledged at his August 8 inauguration.\n\nPetro’s agenda, which he has dubbed “total peace,” is nothing if not ambitious. He proposes simultaneous talks with the National Liberal Army (ELN), FARC splinter groups and over two dozen other mafias—all with the goal of ending Colombia’s epidemic of violence once and for all. If the promises sound big, that’s exactly why many Colombians voted for Petro. After his predecessor, Iván Duque, failed to remedy the situation with a more conventional security policy, there was and is appetite for change.\n\nBut success is far from guaranteed. For now, Petro can count on a pro-government majority in Congress, seasoned peace negotiators in his cabinet, and an open line to Washington, Havana, and Caracas, each of which may figure in eventual talks. Moreover, while opposition to the 2016 Accord was fierce, Total Peace has received little political pushback. Still, much will depend on whether Petro’s government can get three critical groups on board—all without undercutting the state’s bargaining power in the process.\n\nSupport from Strange Bedfellows\n\nFirst, Petro needs buy-in from Colombia’s myriad armed groups and criminal organizations. For now, 22 criminal and armed groups have expressed willingness to enter talks—but they have different incentives to accept or reject peace, which could become a hurdle. Moreover, Petro inherited a crumbling security situation from his predecessor: In 2021, Colombia’s homicide rate stood at 26.8 per 100,000, topping even Mexico’s and reversing years of improving security in the run-up to and immediate aftermath of the 2016 Peace Accord.\n\nThe ELN, which, at 2,500 fighters, remains Latin America’s largest insurgency, has consistently signaled its interest in engaging in talks with the Petro government. In August, Petro signed a decree lifting the arrest and extradition orders for ELN leaders holed up in Cuba. This week, FARC dissidents, who rebuked the 2016 Peace Accord, also met with the Petro government to explore the possibility of dialogue. And the Clan del Golfo, the fragmented successor to Colombia’s right-wing paramilitaries, declared a unilateral ceasefire on the day of Petro’s inauguration to signal its leaders’ willingness to take part.\n\nBut all three groups—plus dozens of other, smaller mafias—also control lucrative drug trafficking routes and illegal mines and have much to lose from dismantling their criminal fiefdoms. Last year, Colombia’s cocaine exports reached near-record-setting amounts. It’s unclear how criminal groups expect to improve their situation, or safeguard their profits, by participating in talks, but they might be vying to turn their fortunes legal. The Petro government recently announced it has plans to pursue cocaine decriminalization.\n\nIf buy-in comes in phases, as it almost certainly will, that could pose its own risks. Still-active mafias could swoop in to take control of territory and illicit trade routes abandoned by groups participating in the talks. That was the story of the swathes of territory vacated by the FARC after 2016. With Mexican cartels growing regionally, a lurking danger is that Colombia’s illicit economies could end up in the hands of new foreign owners with bigger guns.\n\nThat’s what makes buy-in from a second group—Colombia’s armed forces and police—even more critical. Few were surprised when the Petro’s relationship with top brass got off to a rocky start. After all, Petro built his career as a critic of state security force’s checkered history of human rights abuses, and appointed Iván Velásquez, famous for investigating links between right-wing paramilitaries and the state, as his defense minister.\n\nBut the Petro government has moved quickly and aggressively to change military leadership, purging more than half of Colombia’s generals and police commanders in just six weeks. Observers say those left behind are eager to preserve institutional privilege and reputation and likely to fall in line with Petro’s security policy—provided dissenters among their ranks don’t get the upper hand. Retired generals and officers have already publicly criticized Petro’s plans to negotiate with mafias. Keeping security forces on board will be a must for filling vacuums left behind by criminal groups—but it’s sure to be a balancing act.\n\nThird, although less critical than its domestic pillars, Total Peace also needs international support. After all, Colombia’s criminal and armed groups already rely on trade routes and territorial enclaves that run deep into Venezuelan territory. That gives the Maduro regime unfortunate yet undeniable leverage over Colombia’s security situation. In early September, Petro asked Venezuela to act as guarantor to upcoming talks—a request which Maduro eagerly accepted, drawing sharp criticism from U.S. Senate Republicans and Democrats.\n\nBut if Petro aspires to international legitimacy, Total Peace will also require the support of democracies. Chile’s President Gabriel Boric and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez have both offered support. But it remains uncertain whether democratic governments can ensure any kind of transparent process alongside autocratic Venezuela. While Maduro’s participation could push the ELN, which depends heavily on access to Venezuelan territory, to stay at the negotiating table, it also risks legitimizing a brutal dictatorship likely to have ulterior motives.\n\nBellwether or Red Flag?\n\nFor Petro, Colombia and the region, the stakes couldn’t be higher. After a brief reprieve in violence at the height of the pandemic, organized crime is now resurging with a vengeance, eroding the state and threatening investments in Mexico, turning Brazil’s porous borders into lawless no man’s lands, and roiling once-peaceful countries like Ecuador, Paraguay, and Uruguay. A decade ago, governments across the region opted for head-on confrontation to fight organized crime, but mano dura crackdowns largely failed to deliver the desired results, and now leaders are struggling to find a new way forward.\n\nIf Total Peace succeeds, it could provide a blueprint for dozens of other governments across the region and dismantle Colombian criminal groups that have for years spread violence to Colombia’s neighbors, including Peru and Ecuador. But if Petro’s gamble fails, it could spell disaster. Silvana Amaya of Control Risks compared the policy with Colombia’s failed 1999-2002 negotiations with the FARC, which saw the state give the FARC control of the Caguán, a region the size of Switzerland, in a bid to make peace. Instead, the FARC took full advantage of the situation, using the brief reprieve to prepare a siege that would go on to nearly topple the state.\n\n“Today, we’re seeing the formation of mini-Caguáns all over Colombia,” Amaya told AQ. If Colombia’s criminal groups take advantage of upcoming talks to regroup and rearm, the consequences could ripple across Colombia’s borders and give organized crime groups an renewed safe haven. For the Petro government, the current moment presents an unparalleled opportunity and an unparallel challenge. The clock is ticking.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR Will Freeman is a Ph.D. candidate in politics at Princeton University and a 2022 Fulbright-Hays grantee to Colombia, Guatemala and Peru.",
    "Colombia’s ‘dinosaur of peace’": "Researchers now know that, around 175 million years ago, a 12-metre long sauropod, roamed around an area of northern Colombia. The scientific world is attributing the discovery of this new species of herbivorous dinosaur to the improved security situation that exists in Colombia since the signing of a 2016 peace deal, which put an end to half a century of civil war.\n\nJust two years after the signing of the agreement, it was deemed safe for a group of researchers from the Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, and the University of Michigan, United States, to visit the Serranía del Perijá, and gather fresh data.\n\n© Marcos Guevara Professor Aldo Rincón and his guide, Pedro Pablo Contreras, conducting fieldwork in the Serranía del Perijá mountain range.\n\nSearching for clues, 80 years on\n\nThe scientists returned to the place where a fossil of a dinosaur dorsal spine vertebra was found by a geologist working for an oil company in 1943. At the time no-one knew that it was part of a brand-new species and, after the find, the fossil was taken, along with some sediment samples, to the United States and given to the University of California scientific collection at Berkeley.\n\nAldo Rincón Burbano, professor at the Department of Physics and Geosciences at the Universidad del Norte in Barranquilla and one of the research leaders in Colombia, acknowledged that \"without the security conditions provided in the area today, it would have been difficult to return to the field. This is due to the Peace Agreement.\"\n\nThose security conditions are monitored by the UN Verification Mission in Colombia, which was established by the Security Council in 2017 to support the progress of the Peace Agreement, and verify the reintegration of former combatants of the FARC-EP rebel group and their families into Colombian society.\n\n© UNVMC/Jorge Quintero Félix Arango, a 64-year-old former FARC combatant, was one of Professor Aldo Rincón's guides at the ETCR in Tierra Grata.\n\nFrom fighter to guide\n\nFormer FARC-EP fighters provided logistical services, lodging, and guides for the researchers, as they tried to locate the site where the fossil had been unearthed some 80 years earlier.\n\nFélix Arango, a 64-year-old former FARC-EP combatant who now works on an ecotourism project in Tierra Grata, accompanied them on long walks, searching for the exact spot. \"I didn't know they were looking for a dinosaur because they were studying rocks; luckily I was familiar with the area because the former 41st front of the FARC operated there\".\n\n\"We spent almost a year in the process, writing and searching, and although we didn't find any new fossils, we managed to get to the site and find the same sediment collected alongside the vertebra in 1943”, says Mr. Rincón. “By studying the sediment, we were able to conclude that the vertebra was from a new genus, and a new species.”\n\nThey named the species Perijasaurus lapaz: the first part after the place where it was found, and the second as a tribute to the historic Peace Agreement. The dinosaur is similar to other sauropods of this period found in Asia, North Africa, and southern Patagonia, which were smaller than the later dinosaurs belonging to this group.\n\n“We still must look for more fossils in rocks of the same age in other areas of the country. Including the Tatacoa desert in Huila; the Girón area in Santander; and Nobsa in Boyacá,\", says Mr. Rincón.\n\nMr. Arango, the former combatant who accompanied Mr. Rincón and his team, says that, hopefully, these other investigations can also tell the story of the experience of former combatants, who now, thanks to peace, play a different role in society.",
    "Colombia and Venezuela are re-opening their border after seven years": "Colombia and Venezuela are re-opening their border after seven years\n\nWhat might the official re-opening of the border to trade between Colombia and Venezuela mean for the two countries - and for the record number of Venezuelans trying to leave their own country?\n\nAYESHA RASCOE, HOST:\n\nThe border between Colombia and Venezuela has been officially closed to trade for nearly seven years. The countries recently reestablished diplomatic ties. And on Monday, the border reopens to all traffic. Commercial flights between the countries will also resume soon. Manuel Rueda is on the Colombian side of the border for NPR. Good morning.\n\nMANUEL RUEDA, BYLINE: Hi. Good morning, Ayesha.\n\nRASCOE: Why did the border between the two countries close to trade in the first place?\n\nRUEDA: Well, this began in 2015, when the smuggling of cheap, subsidized goods from Venezuela was increasing into Colombia. And then there was an incident where three Venezuelan soldiers were killed, apparently by smugglers. So that kind of launched everything. And after that, the Venezuelan president shut down the border. Then in 2019, tensions flared up again when the Colombian government, with the help of the U.S., was trying to deliver truckloads of aid, of food to the opposition in Venezuela as part of a greater effort to help the opposition groups in Venezuela. After that, the shutdown intensified for a year. Then it's been open for some time just to foot traffic. But on Monday, things will begin to normalize again because we'll see, you know, more commerce - trucks going along the border with different types of goods.\n\nRASCOE: So you've been talking to people on both sides of the border. What will this mean for them and the region as a whole?\n\nRUEDA: Well, this will be very important for businesses on both sides of the border because they can get exchange - for example, raw materials - with each other, without having to resort to smugglers who take goods along dirt paths, you know, along the border, which is what they've been doing for now. So, for example, I was talking to a baker in the town of - on the Venezuelan side, who said, I can import flour from - I could import flour from Colombia now without having to resort to the smugglers, and maybe that'll make my products cheaper. So that's expected to activate the local economy.\n\nRASCOE: And so record numbers of Venezuelans are leaving their country. Will this change encourage more to stay?\n\nRUEDA: Well, not for now, I think. The economic situation in Venezuela is still quite difficult, and it's going to take some time to get that sorted out. So for example, yesterday, I was driving along a road that goes from the Colombian border into the center of Venezuela, and you can still see many people there walking along the road. These are immigrants from Venezuela trying to get into the center of Colombia and to other countries. And they're just walking - right? - because they can't afford the bus fare, you know?\n\nAnd I met a young man there in one of the shelters. He's 21 years old. And he's telling me, look. In Venezuela, I was working at a chicken plant, and my salary was $20 a month, which is more or less the minimum wage in Venezuela at the moment. So he says, you know, this is no way to live. So that's why, you know, people are still leaving. I mean, in August, there were about - Venezuelans were encountered in the border between Mexico and the United States about 25,000 times, which was four times higher than the number of encounters of Venezuelans in August of last year. So you can still see that people are moving...\n\nRASCOE: OK.\n\nRUEDA: ...And people will continue to leave Venezuela while the economic situation does not get sorted out.\n\nRASCOE: OK.\n\nRUEDA: This reopening of the border...\n\nRASCOE: Oh, I...\n\nRUEDA: ...Is a first step.\n\nRASCOE: Thank you.\n\nRUEDA: But there's still...\n\nRASCOE: Thank you. That's Manuel Rueda at the Colombia-Venezuela border. Thank you so much.\n\nCopyright © 2022 NPR. All rights reserved.

The organization also runs many smaller missions that support conflict-resolution and justice efforts in specific countries, including several in Latin America. Though they don’t always make headlines, these U.N. projects often serve as important arbiters.\n\nColombia offers one example. U.N. monitors were critical to the rapid demobilization of guerrilla fighters after the country’s 2016 peace agreement with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) was signed. Today, the U.N. mission in Colombia is assisting new President Gustavo Petro’s efforts to explore a demobilization deal with other guerrilla fighters who sat out of the negotiations six years ago.\n\nThe mission’s “fundamental legitimacy and strength comes from the fact that both sides [of the 2016 peace deal] called for it to be there,” the International Crisis Group’s Ivan Briscoe told Foreign Policy. Even when Iván Duque—who had been opposed to the deal and was resistant to putting his full support behind it—took Colombia’s presidential office in 2018, the mission found a way to continue its work and preserve its legitimacy, Briscoe said.\n\nIn Honduras, U.N. envoys are currently in talks with President Xiomara Castro’s government about opening a special anti-corruption commission in partnership with local prosecutors and judges. A similar U.N.-backed commission was founded in Guatemala in 2007, and Castro had pledged to establish one in Honduras when she campaigned for the presidency late last year.\n\nA previous Organization of American States (OAS)-backed effort to install an anti-corruption commission in Honduras in 2016 was short lived, and its mandate was allowed to expire under Castro’s predecessor, Juan Orlando Hernández, who was extradited to the United States and charged for drug trafficking this year.\n\nFor such a commission to be effective, analysts have argued, it must be free from political inference. Though Guatemala’s commission revolutionized anti-corruption work in the country over the course of about a decade, then-Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales shut it down in 2018—when it began to investigate him. Castro and the U.N. are negotiating just how much independence the commission will have; for example, U.N. envoys have hesitated at her proposal to allow her administration to choose its investigators, El Faro reported.\n\n“Castro’s challenge lies in keeping [her party’s] nose out of the judiciary,” El Faro’s Roman Gressier wrote. If the commission moves forward with independence, it will amount to “[swimming] against the current … in a region whose courts and top prosecutors … have become subservient to the sitting governments.”\n\nMeanwhile, a U.N. fact-finding mission on Venezuela this week released a new report documenting government forces’ torture and rape of detainees from 2014 to the present and tracing the human rights abuses to plans orchestrated “at the highest levels of the government.” Last month, 125 Venezuelan and international civil society and human rights groups praised the U.N. mission and called for its renewal, writing that it has “advanced a search for truth, justice, and reparation.”\n\nThe groups called the U.N. mission’s work complementary to stalled negotiations on Venezuela’s political crisis, writing that its recommendations identify problems that must be addressed in the talks—whenever they resume.\n\nCurrent U.N. missions in Latin America do not always garner this kind of praise from local human rights groups. In Haiti in particular, some civil society advocates have fiercely criticized the U.N. mission there—which has a mandate to enforce political stability, peace, and human rights—for continuing to back unelected Prime Minister Ariel Henry as the country has experienced violent unrest in the wake of former President Jovenel Moïse’s 2021 assassination.\n\nStill, the aforementioned U.N. efforts in Colombia, Venezuela, and Honduras are providing support for peace and justice work in ways their polarized host societies would not be able to do alone.\n\nUpcoming Events\n\nSaturday, Sept. 24: The foreign ministers of the BRICS grouping of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa are slated to meet on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly.\n\nMonday, Sept. 26: The U.N. Human Rights Council discusses Venezuela.\n\nSunday, Oct. 2: Brazilians vote in congressional elections and the first round of the presidential election.\n\nWhat We’re Following\n\nDisaster anniversaries. Mexico and the Caribbean were pummeled by natural disasters on the anniversaries of previous tragedies this week. A magnitude 7.6 earthquake hit Mexico on Sept. 19, the same day as disastrous 2017 and 1985 quakes, while Hurricane Fiona ravaged Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Turks and Caicos Islands on the five-year anniversary of Hurricane Maria.\n\nFiona’s damage was vast, with Puerto Rican authorities registering up to eight deaths by Thursday. The island also experienced a blackout, and 1 million people were reportedly still without power by Thursday morning. In Mexico, Monday’s quake, which left two people dead, came just hours after residents of Mexico City had participated in an earthquake readiness drill. A subsequent quake on Thursday, which President Andrés Manuel López Obrador called an aftershock, also reportedly killed at least two people.\n\nBukele on the ballot. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele said last Thursday that he plans to seek reelection in 2024, an announcement that surprised few. El Salvador’s constitution prohibits presidential reelection, but last year, a panel on the country’s Supreme Court—then recently stacked with pro-Bukele justices—ruled it should be allowed. At the time, the U.S. State Department was among those publicly criticizing the ruling.\n\nReactions from human rights and democracy advocates were harsh. “Today, a new [Hugo] Chávez emerges,” tweeted José Miguel Vivanco, a former Human Rights Watch Americas chief.\n\nThe announcement also prompted a letter from a forum of former Latin American and Spanish leaders that urged the OAS to take measures to “promote the normalization of democratic institutionality” in El Salvador, invoking the OAS’s charter on democracy.\n\nA Guatemalan Indigenous man plays a Mayan ball game at San Juan La Laguna in Sololá, Guatemala, on Sept. 18, 2021.\n\nPause the soccer talk. Mexico’s national Indigenous and Traditional Games took place this month in the state of Sonora, pitting 500 Indigenous athletes against one another in 125 games and sporting activities. It was the 23rd such annual meeting.\n\nWhile some games played at the event involved physical tools—such as balls, gloves, and hockey-like sticks—it also featured mountain running and “mental skill games,” such as contests in how to plan for the harvest. Researchers attended the events to better understand how some of them were connected to Indigenous spirituality, organizer Ana Claudia Collado García told EFE news agency.\n\nOne of the sports played at the event was ulama, where players hit a heavy rubber ball back and forth using their hips. The pre-Colombian game was played across ancient Mexico and Central America and has enjoyed a revival in Mexico over the past decade, during which Mexico City even opened an ulama court. This month’s competition featured Mexico’s second national ulama tournament.\n\nQuestion of the Week\n\nWhich of the following guerrilla groups had already gone defunct by the time of Colombia’s 2016 peace agreement? National Liberation Army (ELN) First Capital Command (PCC) M-19 Los Pelusos Petro belonged to the group before it demobilized in 1990. The PCC is from Brazil, while Los Pelusos and the ELN are Colombian.\n\nFP’s Most Read This Week\n\n• Kazakhstan Is Breaking Out of Russia’s Grip by Temur Umarov\n\n• Ukraine Put Putin in the Corner. Here’s What May Happen Next. by Amy Mackinnon, Robbie Gramer, and Jack Detsch\n\n• What Russia’s Elites Think of Putin Now by Tatiana Stanovaya\n\nIn Focus: China and Ecuador’s Debt Deal\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping meets with Ecuadorian President Guillermo Lasso in Beijing on Feb. 5.\n\nEcuadoran President Guillermo Lasso said on Monday that his country had reached a deal with Beijing to restructure Ecuador’s debt to China. Lasso has sought such a restructuring since early in his presidency, which began last year, and traveled to Beijing in February to pursue it.\n\nUnder the 2007 to 2017 presidency of Rafael Correa, Ecuador took out billions of dollars in loans from China under terms that were opaque to the public, drawing criticism. By this February, Lasso said Ecuador’s outstanding debt to China was $4.6 billion.\n\nUnder the new deal, Ecuador will have three more years to pay back its debts to two Chinese state banks, now due in 2027 and 2032, and will also owe lower interest rates on those payments. Lasso said the deal would free up $1.4 billion that would otherwise be spent on debt repayments by 2025. Ecuador also owes China barrels of oil as part of a separate debt, and last week, Ecuador announced China would allow a delay in scheduled deliveries. This will grant Ecuador some additional $709 million in oil revenue through 2027, the country’s state oil company said.\n\n“This looks like a fairly standard rescheduling,” the Council on Foreign Relations’ Brad Setser tweeted about the news. “Necessary, but not earthshattering.”\n\nLasso celebrated the deal, and economic analyst Alberto Acosta-Burneo told Bloomberg that it was significant not only for providing short-term relief but also because it represented a “relaunch of the relationship with China” and could even pave the way for a new credit line from China in the future. Ecuador is on a tight repayment schedule to the International Monetary Fund and may have trouble borrowing on international capital markets because of its poor rankings from credit agencies, Bloomberg noted.\n\nChina has now carried out post-pandemic debt extensions in several countries, but it has rarely done so in cooperation with other creditors. The sheer scale of Chinese lending to developing countries has prompted scholars, such as Ulrich Volz at SOAS University of London, to call for a more multilateral approach to Chinese debt restructurings.",

    "Passion Fruit and Cape gooseberry are Colombia's new promising fruits": "The new trades seek to consolidate international markets, such as Mexico and the USA. Both Passion Fruit and Cape gooseberry have registered increases in exports during 2022.\n\nThe Colombian fruit export market continues to reactivate and grow. One of the strategies of several entities is to do so with the promising fruits produced there.\n\nThis comes along with a drive to consolidate in international markets. According to reports from ProColombia and the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE), the ten most exported fruits are the following:\n\nThe main destinations for this exports are the following countries :\n\nAccording to Catalina Hernández, vice-president of Exports of ProColombia, both Cape gooseberry and passion fruit have great potential.\n\nAs for the first one, between January and July there was an increase of 5.6% in exports, reaching US$ 21.5 million. Recently explored markets include Mexico, Singapore, Brazil and Panama. Admissibility was obtained in Mexico. Although exports to that market have not yet been registered, studies have been shared with companies to support Colombian exporters in their internationalization processes.\n\nPassion fruit, on the other hand, grew by 25.8% during the first seven months of the year, registering US$30.7 million.\n\nFor this fruit, admissibility in the U.S. is a priority. Additionally, Italy was the market that showed the most growth during the first half of 2022.\n\nHernández also advises that, in order to reach international markets more efficiently, exotic fruit producers must adapt their supply to the requirements of these markets. Sustainability, detailed information on the products and a constant relationship with commercial partners are key. The latter is crucial in order to be aware of new forms of consumption and channels.\n\nHernández also explains that, because they are Colombian exotic fruits, other countries do not know how to consume them. For this reason, it is essential that the exporter and promotion entities support the process of educating and raising awareness in international markets.\n\nHow to achieve export success?\n\nThe Colombian Fruit and Vegetable Association (ASOHOFRUCOL) says that to ensure success in the export sector and encourage exports, they provide comprehensive technical assistance from planting to marketing.\n\nThey provide technical and financial resources in their certification processes regarding the quality seals required by the markets.\n\nThe ASOHOFRUCOL also helps strengthen the entrepreneurship of producers, they promote commercial approaches to link producers with formal allies that aim to export and provide training in relevant technical aspects for proper harvesting and post-harvesting.\n\nAlejandro Ángel, general manager of Caribbean Exotics, points out that these fruits are so sought after for their flavor, color, aroma, texture and high nutritional content.\n\nCaribbean Exotics is a leading company in the sector with more than 30 years of experience exporting exotic fruits to 16 countries.\n\nFor example, Cape gooseberries are a source of vitamin A (3,000 I.U. of carotene per 100 grams), vitamin C, vitamin B complex, protein (0.3%) and phosphorus (55%). Research has shown that it may help prevent diabetes when consumed.\n\nAdditionally, passion fruit is a source of antioxidants, healthy fats, calcium, phosphorus, iron and is rich in fiber and vitamins A, B and C.\n\n\"Thanks to the marketing strategy, Caribbean Exotics can ensure the supply of such fruits 365 days a year. Our suppliers are located in the best regions where soil conditions are optimal, so we can guarantee their quality standard,” Angel said.\n\n“In recent years we have reached Saudi Arabia for the first time, although according to information from the sector, these Colombian fruits also reach Lebanon and the Czech Republic.\n\n“Other countries such as Holland, Germany, Canada, France, Spain and the United Arab Emirates have had significant growth in recent years.\" Angel concluded.",
    "Irrational war on drugs, destruction of the Amazon, expose humanity’s failures, Colombia’s Petro tells UN": "Mr. Petro described his country as one of the most beautiful and nature-rich in the world but said that blood also flowed into its rivers and biodiversity.\n\nHe explained that violence in the rainforest was fuelled by the prosecution of the sacred plant of the Incas: the coca plant.\n\n“As in a paradoxical crossroads. The forest that should be saved is at the same time being destroyed. To destroy the coca plant, they throw poisons such as glyphosate that drips into our waters, they arrest their cultivators and then imprison them,” he stated.\n\nHe added that destroying the Amazon has seemingly become the slogan of some States and negotiators and he denounced such “save the jungle speech” as hypocritical.\n\n“The jungle is burning, gentlemen, while you wage war and play with it. The jungle, the climatic pillar of the world, disappears with all its life. The great sponge that absorbs the planetary CO2 evaporates. The jungle is our saviour, but it is seen in my country as the enemy to defeat, as a weed to be extinguished,” he underscored.\n\nMr. Petro highlighted that while the developed world let the rainforest burn as an excuse for the war against drugs, it also asked for more oil, “to calm their other addiction” to consumption, power and money.\n\n“What is more poisonous for humanity, cocaine, coal or oil? The opinion of power has ordered that cocaine is poison and must be persecuted, while it only causes minimal deaths from overdoses…but instead, coal and oil must be protected, even when it can extinguish all humanity,” he said, adding that such reasoning was “unjust and irrational”.\n\n“The culprit of drug addiction is not the rainforest; it is the irrationality of the world’s power. Give a blow of reason to this power. Turn on the lights of the century again”, he urged.\n\nThe President said that the war against drugs has lasted over 40 years, and it has not been won.\n\n“By hiding the truth, they will only see the rainforest and democracies die. The war on drugs has failed. The fight against the climate crisis has failed,” he noted.\n\nMr. Petro then demanded, speaking in the name of all of Latin-America, the end of the “irrational war against drugs”.\n\n“Reducing drug use does not require wars, it needs us all to build a better society: a more supportive, more affectionate society, where the meaning of life saves us from addictions… Do you want fewer drugs? Think of earning less and giving more love. Think of a rational exercise of power”, he told world leaders.\n\nMr. Petro also addressed the climate disaster and the displacement it causes, saying that wars were only excuses to not act against it.\n\n“The climate disaster that will kill hundreds of millions of people is not being caused by the planet, it is being caused by capital. By the logic of consuming more and more, producing more and more, and for some earning more and more”, he said.\n\nThe Colombian President added that within the fires and poisoning of the Amazon rainforest was embedded a “failure of humanity”.\n\n“Behind cocaine and drug addiction, behind oil and coal addiction, there is the true addiction of this phase of human history: the addiction to irrational power, profit and money. That is the huge deadly machinery that can extinguish humanity”, he explained.\n\nMr. Petro urged a dialogue with Latin-America to end the war, saying it was “time for peace”.\n\n“Only in peace we can save life in our land. There will be no peace without social, economic and environmental justice. We are at war with the planet too. Without peace with the planet, there will be no peace among nations,” he concluded.",
    "Venezuela Monomeros: Leading Fertilizer Company for Colombia": "The Venezuelan government said on Sunday that Barranquilla-based petrochemical company Monómeros would become the leading fertilizer supply company in the Colombian market, Oil Minister Tareck El Aissami said.\n\n\"Images of the unloading of the first shipment of urea to our company Monómeros S.A. Soon we will be, once again, the first fertilizer supply industry for the Colombian countryside producers!\" the official wrote in a Twitter message.\n\nOn September 19, Gustavo Petro's administration returned control of Monómeros to Nicolás Maduro's government following the signing of an agreement between the two countries.\n\nIn 2019, amid a political crisis, the Government of Iván Duque (2018-2022) handed over control of Monómeros to the opposition Juan Guaidó, who had been in \"power\" for three years.\n\nAfter retaking guardianship, Maduro's administration denounced that it received this company with a devastated infrastructure.\n\nFor this reason, he requested Colombia to initiate an investigation for the robbery of the company Monómeros and also expects the arrest of the citizens linked to that case who are in that nation.\n\nIn another message, the official added that the reconstruction and total recovery of the company have already begun to restore commercialization and boost the Colombian agricultural sector.",
    "Hope for Colombia?": "Francia Márquez serves alongside Colombia’s first ever left-wing president, Gustavo Petro, whose manifesto promises to bring much-needed reform to Colombia.\n\nYet Márquez has stepped into government - the very institution that has for so long excluded the communities she represents.\n\nI’m curious to see how she will be received by congress and whether her activist spirit will shine through in her new position of power and influence.\n\nJustice\n\nMárquez is the daughter of miners. Her lineage is deeply rooted within Afro-Colombian artisanal gold mining in her ancestral town of La Tomba – which has long been threatened by multinational mining companies and land grabs.\n\nHaving become a single parent at 16 years old, Márquez became a miner herself to support her family. She was able to see with her own eyes that the very land she had lived, breathed, and worked on was being threatened by the encroachment of multinational corporations.\n\n“We as a people came to have lands that were fought for by our ancestors. When I speak, it is from a place of justice, not just for black people but for Indigenous peoples, women, and nature itself\", said Márquez in a documentary after winning the Goldman Environmental Prize in 2018.\n\nShe added: “I was just a mining woman and didn’t understand the legal language.”\n\nExplosive\n\nThis is what led her to study the law and eventually become a human rights lawyer. She has long represented Afro-Colombian and Indigenous communities.\n\nShe put her law degree studies on hold when black holes began appearing in the red earth rich with gold and rare minerals.\n\nHordes of illegal miners employed by an international gold firm began infiltrating Márquez’s hometown. Márquez spearheaded a ten-day, 350-mile protest march to Bogotá. The marchers stayed in the capital for another 22 days, demanding the withdrawal of the mining company from La Tomba.\n\nThe government agreed and ordered the mining company to leave. When they refused to budge, government forces used explosives to remove the mining equipment.\n\nCommunity\n\nSince that day, Márquez has become a victim of a series of death threats – unable to return to her hometown without being escorted by security forces.\n\nIn response to the success, which led to her winning the Goldman Environmental Prize, she said: “This fight has not only been mine, but the entire community. I was the one that gave it a voice, and sometimes I have given it a face, but we have done all of together.”\n\nMárquez's story is extraordinary, and her entry into a largely elite system is a big step for Colombia’s rural, marginalised populations, who have long battled governments for land rights.\n\nHer political manifesto, which is translated as the The Nobodies, promises recognition for those who have been dispossessed and victims of Colombia’s long history of struggle.",
    "What Health Care in Colombia Could Look Like Under the Petro Government": "BOGOTÁ, Colombia—The center of this South American capital city filled out on August 6 with Indigenous peoples, Afro-Colombians and peasants dressed in traditional attire to carry out the spiritual inauguration of recently elected President Gustavo Petro. The event took place a day before the official inauguration and was accompanied by rituals, songs and speeches.\n\nFor the first time in decades, fear does not reign among the vulnerable and historically abandoned sections of society. Representatives of these groups saluted the president during the inauguration.\n\n“Certainly, the only possible path to real transformation in the country will be achieved with articulated and respectful work between governmental bodies and our own forms of government,” said human-rights defender Marcela Londoño, while reading the popular mandate the collective handed to Petro.\n\nThe Indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities that campaigned in favor of center-left former militant Petro and the first Afro-Colombian woman vice-president, Francia Márquez, helped the pair win up to 99 percent of votes in some regions. Now, these oppressed communities see Petro’s proposal to reform healthcare—among other aspects of Colombian society—as aligning with their culture as well as their spiritual understanding.\n\n“[Under the current system], health is seen as a business that does not value life,” said Mama Luz Dary Aranda, governor of the Guambia reservation in the Cauca department, in an interview with this reporter. “The proposal presented by Petro is the opposite.”\n\n‘Health for Life and Not for Business’\n\nPetro’s campaign promoted the slogan, “health for life and not for business,” advocating a reformed healthcare system based on the principles of prevention, participation, decentralization and an intercultural approach. Part of the proposed solution would involve creating a National Health Council, with the participation of civil society including, academics, healthcare workers, patients, peasants, and Indigenous and Afro-Colombian peoples. Other proposals include ending EPSs (Empresas Prestadoras de Servicios or intermediary health providers); improving scientific investigation and technological development; investing in education; and fighting climate change, among others.\n\nDuring the first healthcare meeting between Indigenous peoples and the Ministry of Health that took place on September 7, Minister Carolina Corcho ratified the compromise of working with the communities to develop the healthcare reform and announced future visits to continue the dialogue.\n\n“The political will by the government of Gustavo Petro—and today more specifically by the Ministry—is very important for this [Indigenous health] system to become a reality,” said Polivio Rosales, senator of the Indigenous Authorities Movement political party.\n\nIncorporating Indigenous Practices\n\nPetro’s program could contribute to complying with the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) recommendation that health policies and programs should recognize and include traditional practices, such as medicine, to ensure the participation of the populations involved, as well as take into account respect for human rights, an intercultural approach, and gender equality.\n\nAfter modernizing medicinal production and engaging government officials—among other actions—the Indigenous and Intercultural Health System (IIHS) was founded in 2014. Yet, such advances have been unequally implemented.\n\n“Within the state’s policies, the Indigenous wisdom of health automatically becomes only an ancestral practice or a belief,” said Mama Ximena Hurtado, director of the Mama Dominga Hospital and health program coordinator on the Indigenous reservation of Guambia in the Cauca department. The title, “Mama,” is given to a woman who holds or has held a position within the Misak government. “Those words minimize our own science, and create a disadvantage and a barrier.”\n\nIn the days before and after Petro’s inauguration, he and a delegation of ministers held regional summits. The administration has prioritized historically abandoned regions, such as the Pacific, the Amazon and the island of San Andrés in the Caribbean Sea, where inequality as well as poor access to healthcare and education reign. Indigenous and Afro-Colombian peoples have participated in these summits.\n\nMisak People Develop a Healthcare Model\n\nMost Misak—around 21,000 people or 1.5 percent of the Colombian population—live on the Guambia reservation. It is located in the steep southwestern mountains of the Cauca region, a rich ecosystem characterized by moors, or high-altitude grasslands. This community has been leading nationally in developing a healthcare model, as well as in the recovery of traditional practices.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the Misak community began taking back ancestral territories through occupation and, later, by negotiating with the government. Within this land, they have set up the House of Medicine Sierra Morena and the Mama Dominga Hospital. The Payan House of Memory, a three-story building constructed according to Misak traditional architectural practices, preserves their history and knowledge.\n\n“This generation has had the opportunity to receive both types of knowledge: The Western and the one taught here by the ‘shures’ and the ‘shuras’ (traditional doctors), which are transmitted from generation to generation and based on the knowledge about plants,” explained Floresmiro Calambas, in charge of the laboratory in the House of Medicine Sierra Morena.\n\nWithin the House of Medicine, the community has set up a medicinal garden with more than 200 species of plants that are processed in the laboratory to be distributed in the community. Misak people affiliated with the healthcare system can acquire natural medicines free of charge. Other services include midwifery, physiotherapy and care from a traditional doctor.\n\nThe Misak community also manages Mama Dominga Hospital, where locals can access basic health services.\n\n“Many of our Indigenous people do not like to leave the territory for fear of how they will be treated or because they do not speak the language,” Mama Ximena said.\n\nThe availability of a healthcare model within the Misak territory guarantees wider coverage in the community, closing the healthcare gap other rural Indigenous and Afro-Colombian peoples have experienced.\n\nAranda argues respecting traditional knowledge while deploying Western practices, when necessary, is essential.\n\n“Sometimes the national healthcare system wants to impose their institutional practices on us,” she said.\n\n‘The Transition Will Be Difficult and We Understand It’\n\n“As Indigenous Peoples, we see health as a whole,” said Alberto Mendoza, delegate of the Wayuu people, after the September 7 meeting. “For that reason, the lack of water or the consumption of low-quality water, as well as the absence of sustainability, impact the health of individuals, families and communities.”\n\nDuring the Pacific region summit, Petro announced Márquez will facilitate regional equality. He committed to designating the first social expenditure to this region as it is the most unequal. Multidimensional poverty in the Pacific region—which takes into account access to health, education and employment—increased from 26 percent to 31 percent between 2019 and 2020.\n\nPetro recognized during his inauguration speech that the government needs to secure resources to implement social reforms.\n\nCongress members like Gustavo Bolivar recently have denounced the poor state of finances left by the previous president, Iván Duque. According to a report presented by the government transition team, the healthcare system has a budget deficit of 6.4 billion pesos (about $1.4 million) for 2022 and 4.6 billion (about $1 million) for 2023.\n\nA tax reform has already been presented in congress that is expected to raise about 25 billion pesos ($5.76 million) over the next year to help execute social programs. The reform includes increasing personal income taxes for the top 2 percent, who earn more than 10 million pesos monthly (around $2,300). Fossil-fuel exports and sugar-based products also will be taxed. The latter tax is designed to reduce health problems associated with sugar consumption.\n\nAranda recognizes Petro’s proposal will take time.\n\n“The transition will be difficult and we understand it,” she said. “But this is when new proposals will be needed and we believe we will be heard to present our proposals on Indigenous healthcare.”\n\n‘Food As Healthcare’\n\nIndigenous communities understand health goes beyond the absence of an illness. To them, health is linked to the environment, their territory, agricultural practice and nature in general. A relationship that, according to Mama Ximena, previous governments have not understood.\n\n“For us, for instance, food and food production are part of healthcare and, therefore, should be financed,” she said. “But [the Health Ministry] sees it as a responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture.”\n\nPetro’s health reform proposal, as well as a wide range of policies that address education, drinking water, the environment and climate change, align with the cosmovision (understanding of life) of Indigenous communities.\n\n“It looks at how health can become a right,” Aranda said, “so that we all can live with dignity.”",
    "Five Ways Sustainable Travel is Accelerating Across Colombia": "The secret has long been out: Colombia is booming as a travel destination, and a visit now will reveal far more gringos visiting than what could be seen only a few short weeks before the global pandemic shut everything down. But now, travelers are back, and popular hotels, guesthouses and hostels are booking up fast. With an influx of visitors comes social and environmental risks, but there are ways to visit this incredible country while mitigating your impact, starting with a few examples below.\n\nNo, you don't need to kill anything now if you want a taco craving (Leon Kaye)\n\nVegan restaurants are easy to find and widely available\n\nColombian food is often brilliant in its simplicity: a protein with sides of starches such as rice, plantains, yucca and potatoes (usually fried) as well as a salad or vegetables. But for those visitors who prefer to avoid any animal products, vegan eateries are increasingly are becoming an option — and while Happy Cow is always a reliable source for locating these places, walking around any neighborhood to find a vegan place should be a matter of minutes, not hours.\n\nTake Medellín, for example. As in many Colombian cities, Mexican food has long become a thing. Walking around El Poblado, a neighborhood long popular with visitors for its forested landscape, range of accommodation and nightlife, it’s easy to find vegetarian and vegan options: and requesting a dish to be vegano is often accommodated. El Pablado itself has at least a couple places offering vegan tacos: Other popular eateries, such as Criminal Taquería, will tweak their menu items if requested.\n\nEven smaller towns, such as the lakeside resort of Guatapé, has vibrant vegan options – and the chances are high that you’ll see locals dining in restaurants as well.\n\nA vegan cazuela (stew), in Guatapé (Leon Kaye)\n\nMore responsible options for transport\n\nPublic transport is always the best option to get around, especially in Colombia, were traipsing within the city centers of Medellín, Bogotá and Cali will nudge you to wear a mask, even if COVID isn’t a concern of yours. Diesel emissions from old vehicles, paired with the fact many of Colombia’s larger cities are wedged between mountains, means dubious levels of emissions.\n\nUber says it is doing its part to take on this challenge. You won’t be able to book an electric car in Colombia yet, but the company is offering riders in big cities an “Uber Planet” option: a 2 percent increase in fees that Uber says will fund Anaconda Carbon, a non-profit partner that issues carbon bonds. These bonds will fund programs that will take on local climate action projects, boost biodiversity protection and reduce the environmental impact of illegal activities such as informal gold mining.\n\nIf you use Uber, keep in mind the fraught relationship the company as with the Colombian government. For a while, Uber was outright banned, but now the service is currently available. But depending on who you talk to, however, Uber is “illegal.” Drivers often keep their phones on their leg or close to the stick shift to avoid any attention from the police — they’ll also often ask you to sit in the front, so they don’t score any attention from police officers or any taxi drivers who resent the service.\n\nOther options to Uber include DiDi and Cabify, which allow you to book through a smartphone app but give you the option to pay the driver in cash.\n\nMedellín’s metro is a gem — fast, efficient and clean and about 3,000 pesos ($0.75) a ride, and they include transfers to most cable cars (gondola lines), which allow you to snap breathtaking views of the city.\n\nAttractions such as Jardín Botánico Joaquín Antonio Uribe in Medellín are accessible by the city's metro (Leon Kaye)\n\nCycling offers a great path toward learning more about Colombia\n\nWhile we’re on the subject of transportation, no trip to Colombia is complete without experiencing its cities and land from two wheels.\n\nPart of cycling’s popularity stems from that fact that Colombians were besides themselves when one of their own, Egan Bernal, won 2019’s Tour de France. In a race dominated for decades by the Belgians, Spanish, Italians and yes, the French, Bernal was the first Latin American to win the 2,200-mile (3,500 kilometers) race.\n\nThe surge in the popularity of cycling is seen in cities such as Bogotá, which has opened up new lanes in order to help citizens move more freely across the city. Bogotá, which years ago launched its ciclovía program on Sundays to encourage residents to walk or cycle on roads that ordinarily would be choking with cars and trucks, has expanded the program so that it’s now occurring daily. Depending on the day of the week, the length of streets closed to cars and opened to cyclists have expanded as much as five-fold. This is on top of the 300-plus miles (500 km) of permanent bicycle lanes that crisscross Colombia’s capital.\n\nMedellín and Cali are among other Colombian cities that have closed major roads on Sundays for years, in part to combat those urban areas’ stubborn air pollution. The success of those car-free days, or ciclovía, have led cities worldwide like Los Angeles to launch their own version of open street days.\n\nCycling tours in Colombia's cities are easy to book (Leon Kaye)\n\nPublic libraries for all\n\nColombia still has deep social divisions, evidenced in the recent elections that launched the country’s politically left president ever. The country of 52 million-plus people has one of the widest income gaps between the rich and poor worldwide. Nevertheless, some local governments deserve credit for addressing the problem. Medellín’s municipal government is one of them.\n\nAmong its various programs, Medellín’s parques bibliotecas (library parks) rank as among the most innovative tactics to expand social welfare. Over the past ten to fifteen years, many of these libraries were built in the poorest neighborhoods where social services were often non-existent or difficult to access. Most of them are architectural gems, deserving of a visit. Residents apparently agree, and the fact that these libraries have a full calendar of events geared to education and children certainly help boost their popularity.\n\nParque Biblioteca León De Greiff La Ladera, Medellín (via Facebook)\n\nVisiting national parks, with limits\n\nColombia’s lush biodiversity is one reason why travelers are increasingly finding their way to the country, whether they seek to trek up one of the few glaciers in a tropical zone, visit the lush Pacific coast or explore the country’s mountainous Zona Cafetera.\n\nBut that tidal wave of interest is paired with the risk of more ecological damage. To that end, local authorities have established limits on how many people can visit these natural wonders, including Los Nevados and Tayrona.\n\nImage credits: Leon Kaye",
    "Colombia: Twenty years of working for reconciliation": "\"Peace, land and dignity for all”\n\n(LWI) - “A marvelous job: Close to the most affected people and communities, seeking to empower them and amplify their voices.” - These words of appreciation from Claudia Rodriguez Burrell, OCHA Representative in Colombia are among many messages of appreciation for the two decades of LWF’s work in Colombia. This year, the LWF Colombia program celebrates its 20th anniversary. It is no coincidence that the program chose to mark this milestone on World Peace Day.\n\n“For two decades we have been accompanying some of the regions in Colombia most affected by armed conflict and inequality”, said Adriana Franco Chitanana, the LWF Representative for Colombia and Venezuela.“ Our commitment to peace focuses on respecting and working with the communities with the highest rates of poverty in the country and those most affected by the internal conflict, reaching the most remote places directly, building trust to work hand in hand with local partner organizations.”\n\nWhen LWF World Service started working in Colombia, the armed conflict was going into its fourth decade. In 2002, at the request of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Colombia LWF started supporting conflict-affected communities, initially from the Central American program.\n\nWhen the human rights situation deteriorated further in 2006, LWF Colombia was registered as a country program, and started working in the departments of Arauca and Choco supporting rural, Afro-Colombian and indigenous communities. Until today, the regions are contested territory between armed groups, prone to natural disaster, and also used as drug and human trafficking routes.\n\nFacilitating peace and reconciliation\n\nThe department of Choco became known in 2002, when an explosive thrown by the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, the main militia group in the armed conflict) exploded inside the village church of Bojayá. The bomb killed 119 people, and wounded 89 who had been seeking shelter inside the building. The explosion also blew away the arms and the legs of the crucifix. The “Christ of Bojayá” became emblematic of the populations’ suffering due to the armed conflict.\n\nLWF supported the community of Bojayá when the massacre was brought to court in 2015. During the same year, members of FARC went to the community asking the people of Bojayá for forgiveness. The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Colombia (IELCO), an LWF member church, and the LWF World Service have supported the peace process and the importance of civil society participation leading up to the peace agreement in 2016, and since its implementation thereafter.\n\nThe “Christ of Bojayá.” During an audience at the Vatican on 7 December 2017, a delegation from the LWF presented Pope Francis with a replica of the statue, as a symbol of reconciliation. Photo: LWF/S. Gallay\n\nLWF worked with the communities in defending their rights and livelihoods, holding authorities accountable, and becoming resilient and autonomous. As part of working towards a peace which is just and fair for the most vulnerable, the rural population receives training on human rights, land rights and international law. In 2014, LWF became registered for mine-risk education.\n\nLWF supports vulnerable communities in getting their land restored to them, so that they can rebuild their lives and their livelihoods. At the same time, LWF has been advocating on national and international level for a lasting peace in Colombia, and contributed to the Human Rights Review of the Country by the UN Human Rights Council.\n\nNew challenges: COVID-19 and Venezuela\n\nOver the years, the LWF has touched the lives of many communities in the departments in Boyacá, Cundinamarca, La Guajira, Putumayo, Santander, Valle del Cauca, Arauca, Casanare, Chocó, Guaviare and Meta. Some of the communities were only accessible by boat – LWF Colombia was the first LWF country program which had its own boat as a means of transportation.\n\nSome communities could only be visited by boat. Photo: LWF Colombia\n\nRecent years have brought a new set of challenges: Natural disaster and the COVID-19 pandemic made it necessary to strengthen community protection mechanisms, and to enhance the regional autonomy of different social, youth, indigenous, peasant and women's organizations. Throughout this period, accompanying the Venezuelan migrant population opened work as a bi-national program in order to support communities in the complex situation of Venezuela.\n\n“We celebrate two decades of this valuable work that would not be possible without the resilience, the struggle for permanence and the defense of the territory undertaken by local communities and organizations. Their knowledge, their own wisdom, organizational processes and leadership drive us to continue defending human rights and working with and for the populations affected by crises to achieve justice, peace and dignity in Colombia and Venezuela,” the LWF Representative concluded.\n\nLWF’s work in Colombia has been supported by many partners over the past two decades, including the ACT Alliance, the German National Committee, FELM, Church of Sweden, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America, Diakonie Katastrophenhilfe, and many local organizations.\n\nLWF will commemorate its 20 year anniversary on 21 September, 4.30 pm Colombian time (GMT –5). Part of the event will be live streamed on the LWF Colombia facebook page.\n\nSupport LWF World Service",

READ MORE\n\nBOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Trucks loaded with aluminum and medications crossed a bridge linking Colombia and Venezuela for the first time in seven years Monday following restoration of diplomatic relations, giving regional businesses hope for growing trade.\n\nColombia’s new leftist President Gustavo Petro, who took office in August and quickly moved to reestablish ties with Venezuela’s government, was on hand as the trucks rolled across the Simon Bolivar International Bridge between Cucuta, Colombia, and San Antonio, Venezuela. It was once one of the busiest crossings between the two South American nations.\n\nResidents of border areas and business owners in both countries expect the resumption of cargo traffic to generate jobs and reduce the thriving illegal commerce.\n\n“Hopefully, we can reactivate the 1,200 direct jobs that were lost,” said Sandra Guzmán Lizarazo, president of the Colombian Federation of Logistics Agents in International Trade, which had to close all but one of its 15 customs warehouses in the Colombian border city of Cúcuta when commercial traffic was blocked.\n\nVenezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in 2015 ordered border crossings closed during what he described as a crackdown on smuggling. Foot traffic eventually resumed, and some very limited cargo continued to move through the northernmost bridge.\n\nRelations were already strained between Maduro’s socialist government and U.S.-allied Colombia. They were strained further after Maduro’s 2018 reelection, which Colombia, the U.S. and many other nations considered illegitimate. Diplomatic relations were severed the following year.\n\nTrade between the two countries reached $2.4 billion in 2014 but fell to about $406 million last year — most of it Venezuelan imports from Colombia — according to the Chamber of Venezuelan-Colombian Economic Integration. The group, based in Venezuela, estimates this year’s activity could exceed $1 billion if the crossings reopen to vehicular traffic.\n\nThe Venezuelan government has estimated that the commercial exchange within a year of a fully reopened border could exceed $4 billion.\n\nThe first truck to cross the bridge entered Colombia carrying aluminum rolls from Venezuela. The next truck moved in the opposite direction, hauling medicines. Each was decorated with flags and honked as it entered the neighboring country.\n\nPetro said the trucks’ movement is a “symbol of unity” and indicated that the border should never have been closed.\n\n“Globalization, above all else, is trade and unity between neighbors,” he told reporters after the event. “Anyone who measures the flows of international trade, cultural flows, population flows, will always find that the greatest amount is between neighbors and that is how it was before sectarian madness took over hearts and brains. So, it was between Colombia and Venezuela.”\n\nVenezuela Transportation Minister Ramón Velásquez repeatedly shook Petro’s hand as they stood with a group of officials, including the ambassadors of both countries, at the bridge’s midpoint.\n\nMaduro did not attend the ceremony at the bridge. He has curtailed his public appearances in relatively uncontrolled spaces since 2018, when two drones detonated explosives near him during a military parade in Caracas, Venezuela’s capital.\n\nColombia and Venezuela share a border of about 1,370 miles (2,200 kilometers). Bandits, drug traffickers, paramilitary groups and guerrillas take advantage of the remote and desolate landscape to operate, though that did not deter legal trade before Maduro ordered the closure of official border crossings.\n\nAll but two of the bridges are within a 45-mile (75-kilometer) stretch, which before the shutdown handled 60% of commercial activity between the neighbors.\n\nJavier Pabón, president of the board of directors of the Cúcuta Chamber of Commerce, said that reopening the bridge to commercial traffic can discourage smuggling because business owners would prefer to export their products legally with all guarantees.\n\n“It will reduce the illegal intermediation that occurs toward Venezuela,” Pabón said.\n\nIn addition to controlling smuggling, one of the main challenges the governments face is guaranteeing security along the border, where there is a presence of illegal armed groups, such as the guerrilla National Liberation Army, the Clan del Golfo and breakaway members of the extinct Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.\n\n___\n\nGarcia Cano reported from Caracas, Venezuela.\n\nCopyright © 2022 .

    "Colombia publishes Geographic Standard for Geothermal Information": "Colombia publishes Geographic Standard for Geothermal Information\n\nCity view, Medellín, Colombia (source: flickr/ *Iván Erre Jota*, creative commons)\n\nCarlo Cariaga 13 Sep 2022\n\nThe Colombian Geological Service has published the Geographic Standard for Geothermal Information, a guide for the documentation of geothermal data from exploration areas.\n\nThe Colombian Government has worked to advance the energy transition for Colombia and, through its Congress, published Law 2099 of July 10, 2021, which defines provisions for the use, development and promotion of non-conventional sources of energy, including geothermal energy.\n\nIn “Chapter III of the Geothermal Resource,” is the geothermal registry where all those projects for exploration and exploitation to generate electricity will be registered. On the other hand, the Ministry of Mines and Energy (Minenergia),\n\npublished Decree 1318 of July 27, 2022 which regulates the development of activities aimed at generating electricity through geothermal energy, and Resolution 40302 of August 5, 2022, which establishes the technical requirements that will govern the Geothermal Registry and geothermal resource exploration and exploitation permits.\n\nFor its part, the Colombian Geological Service (CGS), a Science and Technology entity linked to Minenergia, represented by the Geothermal Research Group, actively participated from the beginning of the geothermal working tables developed from 2016 to 2020, carried out with Colombian government entities, with the support of the IDB and led by Minenergia, and with the participation of state and regional entities such as the Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development, autonomous corporations, the Mining and Energy Planning Unit (UPME), among others.\n\nAs a contribution to this inter-institutional effort, the CGS published in November 2021 the Approach to the geothermal potential of Colombia (Alfaro et al., 2021), estimated at 1170 MWe; and supported the definition of annexes 1 and 2 of Resolution 40302 of August 5th 2022 issued by Minenergia.\n\nThe Annex 1 “Geothermal exploration information delivery guide” was defined for the information generated by public and private entities in terms of geology, geophysics, fluid geochemistry, conceptual modeling of geothermal fields; and the Annex 2 “Guide for delivery of well drilling information and its evaluation” was defined for the information generated by the drilling of geothermal wells and their evaluation.\n\nAdditionally, the Geothermal Research Group of the CGS recently published the Cartographic Standard for Geothermal Information (ECIG) as a milestone for the entity. This document is the first Colombian CGS geographic information standard, prepared in accordance with the guidelines and policies of the Colombian Spatial Data Infrastructure (ICDE), which guarantees the interoperability of the data, not only for the CGS, but also at an intersectoral level and national, because it complies with ISO and NTC standards.\n\n\n\nThe goal of the ECIG is to define the basic guidelines for the storage and cartographic representation of the geothermal data\n\nacquired in the geothermal exploration areas, which guarantee the quality, organization and uniformity, thus being the technical support to comply with the delivery of information required in Annexes 1 and 2 of Resolution 40302 of 2022. The information will be integrated from geology, geophysics, geochemistry, geomorphology and elements of geothermal energy, in accordance with the SGC standards, for its availability to the scientific and academic community and the general public.\n\nTherefore, the inter-institutional efforts of the Colombian State are focused on the significant progress in the recognition and investigation of geothermal resources, in the definition and establishment of the regulatory framework for the use of the resource; and the granting of tax benefits, such as incentives, for the generation of electricity with non-conventional energy sources (FNCE), including geothermal energy, and efficient energy management, in accordance with\n\nLaw 1715 of 2014, modified by Law 2099 of 2021.\n\nSource: Email correspondence via our Spanish language platform PiensaGeotermia",
    "City of Bogota, Colombia could tap geothermal for electricity": "City of Bogota, Colombia could tap geothermal for electricity\n\nEvening view over Bogota, Colombia (source: flickr/ Tijs Zwinkels, creative commons)\n\nAlexander Richter 4 Sep 2022\n\nGeothermal energy could play a huge role in the provision of energy to the megacities of this world, e.g. covering all electricity (and more) to Bogota, capital of Colombia.\n\nThe city of Bogotá, the Capital of Colombia in South America, is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, representing a great opportunity to tap geothermal energy. It represents the opportunity to decarbonize the energy matrix of megacities, that is, those inhabited by more than 10 million people, so a recent article shared by the the University of the National University of Colombia (UNAL). The article builds on a study carried out in three megacities: Los Angeles (U.S.), Jakarta (Indonesia) and Bogotá (Colombia), which showed that between Zipaquirá (Cundinamarca) and Paipa (Boyacá) [in Bototá] there is an area with high potential to extract energy from the earth, which would potentially cover the total residential energy demand for Colombia’s capital.\n\nDecarbonization is the focus of the research in which Professor Carlos Vargas, from the Faculty of Sciences of UNAL, participated. The research focused on data that the National Hydrocarbons Agency and the Colombian Geological Service have compiled and used for many years to have a measurement of the magnetic, thermal and geochemical information of the Colombian territory.\n\nThis data made it possible to map the zones, estimating the “Curie depth”, a measure inferred from the magnetic anomalies present in the subsoil, which means that the higher the temperature when the earth falls, the more the magnetic force of the earth decreases. the minerals present there, and when this occurs it can be said that in these areas there is a greater possibility of extracting energy from the earth.\n\n“It was found that the region near the north of Bogotá, between Zipaquirá and Paipa, is an important area that contains this heat resource, which is evidenced by the presence of thermal waters and pools, in addition to other geochemical parameters evaluated there by the oil industry”, so the expert.\n\nIn Bogotá today 14,509,200 GWh (14,509 TWh) are consumed and the supply can grow more and more. The investigation determined that up to 16,603 TWh could be provided by the exploitation and extraction of geothermal energy.\n\nTogether with professors Luca Caracciolo, from the GeoZentrum Nordbayern (Geocentre of North Bavaria) of the Friedrich-Alexander University (Erlangen-Nürnberg, Germany), and Philip J. Ball, from the Faculty of Geography, Geology and Environment of the Keele University (United Kingdom), estimated that 73,502,200 GWh per year are used in Los Angeles, and it is calculated that geothermal could supply up to 4.25 times more energy to the city; For its part, Jakarta consumes 10,927,163 GWh, and geothermal could provide capacity by 1.84 times more. The report was published in December 2020.\n\nGeothermal energy as a sustainable alternative\n\nAccording to the geologist, “this amount of energy can guarantee sufficient resources for long-term geothermal plants that take advantage of their location to supply electricity and hot water for industrial and recreational processes.”\n\n“Geothermal energy has greater stability –having sufficient resources– than other energies such as hydroelectric or hydraulic –because in times of drought there are problems of storage and reserve of this resource–, solar energy –since its recharge depends on the moment of the day in which the sun’s rays provide it– and wind power, whose operation is subject to specific currents at certain times of the year”, highlights the teacher.\n\nAlthough at the beginning the costs are higher –machinery, studies, experts, transportation, precaution to treat the subsoil–, in the long term these are reduced, which is evident in Los Angeles and Jakarta: while in LA geothermal energy costs 0.004 cents dollar ($18) and fossil 0.138 ($606), in Jakarta the ratio is 0.006 ($26) geothermal and 0.112 ($492) fossil.\n\nThe academic explains that “geothermal energy has various industrial uses, including producing the electricity that supplies cities; improve plant cultivation processes in greenhouses, as well as heating for homes during the winter, especially in some regions of the planet (high latitudes and altitudes)”.\n\nFor the researcher, the implementation of these energy strategies allows expanding the range of possibilities, since the processes and changes of radiation or heat generation inside the Earth change in millions of years, and not in seasons of days, months or years. .\n\nIt is important to emphasize that geothermal extraction can also have disadvantages, the most important of which is the possible contamination of nearby waters by substances such as arsenic or ammonia -extremely toxic to living beings-, components found in the soil and that can be released when doing the extraction, if the procedures are not carried out properly.\n\nSource: UNAL",
    "Colombia and Venezuela to reopen shared border to cargo transport": "Easing of restrictions comes as neighbouring countries seek to normalise relations after years of tension.\n\nThe presidents of Colombia and Venezuela have announced that commercial flights will resume between the two nations and cargo transport will be allowed across their shared border on September 26 after a years-long closure.\n\nThe announcement on Friday marks the latest example of increased cooperation between the neighbouring countries since left-wing Colombian President Gustavo Petro took office in August on a promise to re-establish formal relations with Venezuela.\n\nThe 2,200km (1,370-mile) shared border between Colombia and Venezuela is currently open to pedestrian traffic, but only limited cargo transport.\n\n“We confirm the government’s commitment to restore brotherly relations,” Petro said on Twitter on Friday. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro also tweeted that “the exchange and cooperation between our peoples are starting off on the right foot”.\n\n“In addition, we will resume flights between Caracas-Bogota and Valencia-Bogota,” Maduro added.\n\nLast month, the two countries restored full diplomatic relations after a three-year break. Both countries have now accepted each other’s ambassadors, but the two heads of state have yet to announce a state visit.\n\nUnder Petro’s right-wing predecessor Ivan Duque, Colombia refused to recognise Maduro as Venezuela’s leader after his 2018 re-election, which Duque said was fraudulent.\n\nColombia’s ambassador arrived in Venezuela last month and was welcomed by Venezuela’s Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Rander Pena Ramirez, who tweeted that “our historical ties summon us to work together for the happiness of our peoples”.\n\nCaracas broke off ties with Bogota in 2019 after members of the Venezuelan opposition tried to cross from Colombian territory with trucks loaded with food and medicine.\n\nIt also closed the border, saying the aid masked an attempted coup by the opposition with support from the United States. Embassies and consulates in both countries were shut down, and flights between the neighbours were grounded.\n\nMaduro had ordered the closure of legal crossing points in 2015 after an incident during an anti-smuggling operation along the border. Foot traffic eventually resumed, and some cargo continued to move through a bridge in the north.\n\nThe closures have not ended the transportation of various goods, some of them over dirt roads by armed groups, into Venezuela. Criminal groups have also used the roads for trafficking operations.\n\nColombia has previously accused Venezuela of offering assistance and shelter to armed groups in the border region, a claim bolstered by a report by Human Rights Watch in March.\n\nThe Chamber of Venezuelan-Colombian Economic Integration has estimated that reopening crossings to vehicular traffic could result in a substantial increase in commerce, from $406m last year to an estimated $1.2bn this year.\n\nThe Venezuelan government has said the economic activity within a year of a fully reopened border could be more than $4bn.",

Authorities of both countries are currently exchanging at different border points.\n\nHowever, on Friday, Benedetti also informed that the airline of Consorcio Venezolano de Industrias Aeronáuticas y Servicios Aéreos S.A. (Conviasa) will not fly to Colombia due to the sanctions against it still in place.\n\nThe Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) published on February 7, 2020 a measure that sanctions any transaction between U.S. citizens and companies with the Venezuelan airline company.\n\nThis measure was added to the one that had been published in August 2019, preventing any Conviasa aircraft from traveling to the United States.",

    "Colombia relaunches plan to buy fighter jets": "SANTIAGO, Chile — Colombian President Gustavo Petro has reactivated the process to acquire new fighter jets to replace the country’s aging Kfir fleet.\n\nPetro’s decision may come as a surprise given his stance earlier this year on the campaign trail, when he said the purchase of combat aircraft or other military hardware would not be a priority during his time in office, if elected.\n\nMilitary sources in the capital Bogota, speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect their careers, told Defense News that the credit for Petro’s U-turn belongs to Gen. Luis Carlos Córdoba, the chief of the Colombian Air Force. They explained that Córdoba convinced Defense Minister Iván Velásquez about the urgent need to replace at least part of the Kfir fleet, which will begin retirements later this year, and Velásquez in turn persuaded the president.\n\nSince 1989, Colombia has acquired 24 Kfir jets, made by Israel Aerospace Industries. To counterbalance the acquisition of Sukhoi Su-32 fighters by Venezuela, Colombia’s Kfir fleet underwent upgrades between 2009 and 2017 performed by IAI’s Lahav Division.\n\nThe last upgrade, to the C-60 standard, involved fitting Elta Systems’ ELM-2032 active electronically scanned array radar and a data link as well as integrating Rafael Advanced Defense Systems’ Derby weapon — an air-to-air, beyond-visual-range missile. IAI says that standard is equivalent to the F-16 Block 52.\n\nColombia’s modernized Kfirs are possibly the most advanced fighter jets with the most capable systems in service in South America. But the age of the airframes is taking its toll; between 2012 and 2014, multiple aircraft were lost in accidents, at one point grounding the entire fleet. Extensive maintenance support from IAI brought the aircraft back to service.\n\nThe Colombian government is now considering how it can afford to buy new fighters. The president is already pressing for investments in social issues, and about 25% of the country’s annual budget is earmarked to pay off debts.\n\nBogota-based independent defense and security analyst Erich Saumeth is skeptical.\n\n“President Preto came into power making many promises about social development spending, and has a core group of supporters that are not friendly about buying military equipment. On the other hand, the Army and Navy also have need of modernization,” Saumeth told Defense News. “So either nothing will happen, or [there will be] a not-so-good, sort-of-mediocre stopgap solution.”\n\nColombia previously received offers of secondhand Eurofigher Typhoon and Dassault Rafale fighters, but the Air Force, which prefers single-engine aircraft, appears focused on Lockheed Martin’s F-16 and Saab’s Gripen. The government has already received offers of both new aircraft of the latest variants as well as secondhand, upgraded options.\n\nOne of the military sources told Defense News that “most likely a first batch of 12 aircraft will be procured” and that “secondhand offers of modern airframes with a large service life remaining and significant upgrade potential are surely to attract more interest than before.”\n\nJosé Higuera is the South America correspondent for Defense News, covering South American and Latin American affairs.",

    "Colombia: Committee on Enforced Disappearances welcomes significant step to examine complaints - Colombia": "GENEVA (31 August 2022) – The UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances on Wednesday welcomed the declaration by the Colombian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to recognise the Committee’s competence to investigate individual complaints and interstate communications. It commended that the decision is a significant step forward in the country’s human rights development and will enhance the protection of victims of enforced disappearance. The Committee issued the following statement:\n\n“We welcome the declaration by the Colombian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Cancillería) on 30 August 2022 recognising the competence of the Committee on Enforced Disappearances to examine individual complaints and interstate communications.\n\nThe crime of enforced disappearance is a particularly heinous violation of human rights, causing severe suffering for the disappeared and their relatives and involving multiple violations of human rights. The impunity and lack of reparation that frequently surround enforced disappearances aggravates victims' suffering and leads to their re-victimisation.\n\nThe individual complaints procedure before the Committee on Enforced Disappearances enables victims to seek reparation at the international level after exhausting national remedies. It thus empowers victims, families and relatives in their daily fight for truth and justice. We congratulate Colombia for further helping the relatives of the disappeared and their supporting groups in their battle by accepting the competence of the Committee to examine individual complaints.\n\nOnce the declaration has entered into force, the Committee will be able to receive and consider communications from, or on behalf of, individuals claiming to be victims of a violation of any of their rights contained in the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, as per Article 31 of the Convention.\n\nArticle 32 will also allow the Committee to receive communications from a State Party alleging that another State Party is not fulfilling its obligations under the Convention. Both procedures enhance the protection of victims of enforced disappearances in Colombia.\n\nThe declaration will take effect once it is submitted to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and we invite Colombia to take this decisive step as soon as possible.”\n\nFor more information and media requests in Geneva, please contact:\n\nVivian Kwok at +41 (0) 22 917 9362 / vivian.kwok@un.org or the UN Human Rights Office Media Section at +41 (0) 22 928 9855 / ohchr-media@un.org\n\nBackground\n\nThe Committee on Enforced Disappearances monitors States parties’ adherence to the International Convention for the Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappearance.

    "Comparing Sudan and Colombia peace agreements: similarities and differences": "The Juba Peace Agreement: the dilemma of the coup, implementation and popular rejection\n\nby Yasir Arman*\n\n• As long as the Sudanese state is not based on a national project that commands wide consensus, sufficient social justice and non-discriminatory citizenship, there will always be those who rebel against it.\n\n• Our country is in dire need of fundamental reforms, including reforming and completing the Juba Peace Process.\n\n• The armed struggle movements are not a cohesive bloc, reflecting social and political contradictions. It is time for them to evolve from protest movements into movements committed to far-reaching social programs, effective policies for change, and a firm stance on totalitarianism.\n\n• Demanding the cancellation of the Juba Peace Agreement will only deepen ethnic and geographical grievances, whereas revising it with the consent of all parties would be in everyone’s interest.\n\n1. In Juba, I had the opportunity to talk to one of the experts brought by the AU-UN Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID), a former officer in the Colombian army who participated in negotiations between the Colombian government and the FARC or the Revolutionary Armed Forces – People’s Army, on the Colombian Peace Agreement that ended a war that lasted for almost 50 years. I had already met some of the leaders of the FARC in Berlin. I was planning to visit Colombia in October 2022, my 60th birthday, but coups bring winds that blow against our wishes.\n\nI have visited many parts of the world except Latin America, which I have a yearning to visit. it is an enchanting land full of poverty, resistance, history, culture, drug cartels, and banana republics, as they used to be called, thereby underestimating their true importance. It is also a land of drugs and transnational companies, and a land of magical and miraculous realism. Colombia combines all these attributes and is an amalgam of Latin America’s whole DNA. Colombia was the birthplace of Gabriel García Márquez, the most famous novelist in Latin America, Pablo Escobar, the world’s most notorious drug lord and the FARC, the most famous revolutionary guerrilla organization that fought for five decades and reached a peace agreement after the departure or murder of its senior leaders, Manuel Marulanda, Jacobo Arenas and Alfonso Cano.\n\n2. The 25 October coup d’état ended all the important achievements of the December Revolution and placed obstacles in the way of peace, the economy, foreign relations and democratic civilian governance. One of the extraordinary features of the coup is that most of the armed movements abandoned their declared programs and slogans about the reform of state structures and democratic transformation. Some of them participated in the coup and took part in a desperate defence of the centre of power, sometimes with more fanfare than those at the centre themselves – a paradox which is in complete contradiction to their discourse of marginalization and equal citizenship, ignoring the future and forgetting the struggles of the past. The peace agreement was treated as if it was a certificate of citizenship allowing integration into the old regime with a small share of power and wealth, whose drops do not reach the lips of the poor who are craving justice and equity. The agreement has gone from being a peaceful mechanism for change to be an obstacle to change. Some movements have even adopted an outspoken position against the glorious December Revolution. That Revolution made peace one of its central slogans, ending decades during which Bashir’s regime rejected a just peace, and it paved the way for the armed struggle movements to make an active contribution to establishing a new order and effecting fundamental changes in the power structure that had long eluded them. It was they who had waged a determined, courageous and costly struggle in Sudan’s peripheries and rural areas. Yet instead of allying with the Revolution to change the old centre, they allied with the old centre against the Revolution itself.\n\nThere is a fundamental difference between the Juba Peace Agreement and the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement as regards South Sudan and the movements that signed the Juba Agreement. The Comprehensive Peace Agreement gave the southern nationalists the right of self-determination as an alternative to the path of struggling to change the status quo, which was too costly in their view. The movements that signed the Juba Peace Agreement do not have the luxury of the alternative provided by the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, which made southern nationalists less interested in democratic transformation than in the right to self-determination. Another factor was the complicity of the National Congress Party, for whom maintaining their position of power in Khartoum was more important than preserving the unity of Sudan, even if it meant enabling southern nationalists to establish an independent state. But the armed struggle movements that signed the Juba Peace Agreement do not have this alternative and will therefore pay the price of accepting the coup because the peace agreement will be aborted and the old regime will remain. This led to war in the Two Areas previously because they did not have the right to self-determination and had to deal with the complexities of the old regime and the greed and totalitarianism of National Congress Party rule.\n\nMost of the armed struggle movements have dropped democracy from their calculations without being able to resolve the issues of their people on the ground who are still strongly supportive of the glorious December Revolution, and who recently came out in Darfur and the Two Areas on 30 June with great gusto. Consequently, these movements now face a dilemma as they did not achieve a transformation in the old power structure, and many of their supporters will hesitate to accompany them if they want to return to square one prior to Juba. They have also ignored the struggle to expand the space for democratic political action as a means of change. A few movements have done well to maintain their relations with the forces of the Revolution and their alliances. Some of the armed struggle movements seem to have reached a deadlock in the choices they could make.\n\n–\n\n3. The dilemma of implementation. The Juba Peace Agreement consists of ten chapters, starting with the preamble, which speaks – paradoxically as things have turned out – of ending totalitarian and dictatorial regimes and establishing a democratic and developmental state. It pays tribute to the martyrs of the armed struggle forces who sacrificed their souls for the nation, the wounded and the missing who paved the way for freedom, justice, peace and development. The preamble emphasizes meeting the aspirations of the Revolution! What is happening now has nothing to do with this preamble, which its signatories do not remember.\n\nIf we turn to the first chapter of the Juba Peace Agreement, it talks about national issues, numbering 29 altogether, the most important of which are the transitional period, the Constitutional Document, the National Governance Conference, reform of the justice system, the census, elections, and specific issues such as those of the Kanabi communities, the environment, a conference for the states of Khartoum and North Kordofan, the issues of Christians, nomads, pastoralists and farmers, combating racism, Commissions, the National Commission of resources and financial revenue sharing and allocation, the role of the Sudanese private sector, education, pensioners and personnel who were dismissed arbitrarily and other issues. None of the national issues in this chapter have been successfully implemented. No one mentions or remembers these issues today. There is complete silence from those who negotiated with them and from those who even chanted during the Palace in preparation for the 25 October coup “We won’t leave tonight unless there is a statement (from the military)!”\n\nThe Agreement covers issues related to security arrangements, security sector reform at the national level and the integration of the forces of the armed movements within the process of building a single national professional army. It also covers land issues, the return of internally displaced persons and refugees, and the provision of 40% of the revenue generated from the natural resources of the states in conflict-affected areas – something that has not been implemented over the past two years, even though the Ministry of Finance has been assigned to the armed movements. None of these provisions or those in other chapters of the Agreement, including federalism and autonomy, have been implemented apart from power-sharing which has been reduced to merely giving jobs to individuals and financial benefits to some of the movements. Violence has increased in the former conflict-affected states. It is puzzling that issues of implementation have dropped off the agenda, that the guarantors of the agreement are no longer effective and that there are no mechanisms for implementation or involvement of the Sudanese people. This leaves the armed struggle movements at odds with their history, their slogans, their sacrifices and their people on the ground at a time when there are growing calls from different platforms to cancel the Juba Peace Agreement. However, this is a mistaken call that would not provide solutions and would only increase ethnic and geographical grievances and tensions.\n\n4. What happened in Colombia and the revision of the Colombian Peace Agreement\n\nThe war in Colombia began in 1964 and ended in 2016, with the participation of multiple movements, the most famous of which was the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia – People’s Army (FARC). Colombia’s National Liberation Army continues the war and is negotiating with the government to this day. The situation in Colombia is therefore similar to that of Sudan in many respects but also differs from it. The Peace Agreement in Colombia was signed on 24 August 2016 in the Cuban capital, Havana, and was put to a referendum for ratification with the strong support of President Juan Manuel Santos. The Agreement narrowly failed to pass the referendum with 50.2% voting against it and 49.8% voting in favour but President Santos and the FARC leadership agreed to revise the Agreement rather than cancelling it. Revisions were made and it was agreed that the revised version should be submitted to Congress for ratification rather than be put to another referendum. The revised Agreement was ratified on 29-30 November 2016. The wisdom of the FARC movement was reflected in two things. Firstly, it agreed to revise the Agreement to gain greater popular support, while preserving the core issues covered by the Agreement, which address the root causes of the war, namely agrarian reform, social justice, citizenship issues, reform of the state organs, protection and integration of ex-combatants, implementation of security arrangements, passage of agreed constitutional amendments, freedom to participate in politics, strengthening democratic civilian governance, combating cartel Interests, building a broad front for the forces of change etc. This front ultimately supported one candidate from the revolutionary movements that signed an agreement before the Havana Agreement in 1990 and belong to the M19 movement – Gustavo Petro, the current President of Colombia, who won at the head of a left-wing alliance on 19 June 2022, for the first time in Colombia’s history.\n\nIn Colombia, armed struggle movements have stood in favour of renewal, reform, equal citizenship, social justice, democratic civilian governance, constitutional reforms, and the peaceful transfer of power. This position is to be recommended to the armed struggle movements in Sudan to consider and review their experience, especially those who participated in the coup.\n\n5. Position on the Juba Peace Agreement\n\nCalling for the rejection and cancellation of the Juba Peace Agreement because of growing public anger at the behaviour of some of the armed movement leaders is wrong, in my view, but ignoring public opinion would also serve to make the agreement isolated. We need to think outside the box to preserve the Juba Peace Agreement and complete the process with the non-signatories.\n\nWe must treat peace as a strategic issue for building the Sudanese state and as one of the pillars of the new national project. We must leave behind the painful experiences of the past, and former President Jaafar Nimeiri’s remark about the Addis Ababa agreement not being the Koran or the Bible, which helped to pave the way for a long war from 1983 to 2005. Revoking agreements and covenants is something that we must avoid and remember the book of that remarkable judge and noble patriot Maulana Abel Alier (Southern Sudan: Too Many Agreements Dishonored)\n\nThe Juba Peace Agreement is not without its shortcomings, foremost of which is the issue of regional tracks, which we opposed in Juba. However, its shortcomings are not a valid argument for cancelling the Agreement, but rather a reason to complete it, abide by it and revise it with the consent of its signatories, especially since the glorious December Revolution treated peace as a strategic issue and as one of its main slogans. The mistakes of the leaders of the armed movements do not negate the valiant struggle of those movements against the Bashir regime. The Juba Peace Agreement has potentially brought real benefits to people in the conflict zones. We should therefore abide by it and develop it to address the root causes of conflict and work to complete the process.\n\nIf we are in the process of drafting a new Constitutional Document, not returning to the situation on 24 October and overthrowing the 25 October coup d’état, this means that we are in the process of a full and positive review that could include the Juba Peace Agreement with the participation of its signatory parties, as happened in Colombia, to address the mistakes, to give the agreement new public momentum and support, to link it to democratic civilian governance and to complete the process with the signature of the two leaders, Abdelaziz Al Hilu and Abdel Wahid al-Nour. This would help to give peace a new public depth and a popular dimension given the growing campaigns against the Juba Peace Agreement, the scarcity of resources needed to implement it, the difficulty of mobilizing available resources properly in the context of the off-putting coup environment, hostile campaigns against the agreement and misinformation intended to distort it coming from within the organs of the regime, and the need to give the implementation of security arrangements the priority it deserves.\n\nWe should refrain from demanding the cancellation of the Juba Peace Agreement, especially as the forces of the revolution struggled so hard to conclude it. We must support all the gains obtained by the conflict zones that address the root causes of war and ensure that we do not increase ethnic tensions and geographical divisions, as this would be contrary to the interests of Sudan and the forces of the Revolution.\n\nRemoving the causes of war will strengthen the unity of Sudan. The quest to build a new, democratic Sudan based on non-discriminatory citizenship is the only way out of our country’s complex crisis.",
    "Colombia Expects Record Passenger Numbers In 2022": "Colombia has had the strongest civil aviation recovery in the Americas in 2022.\n\nThe Colombian civil aviation authorities (Aerocivil) expect the country to receive up to 46 million passengers in 2022, which would be an all-time record, surpassing pre-pandemic traffic levels by nearly 12%. Colombia, fueled by the rise of ultra-low-cost carriers such as Viva and Ultra Air, and a strong recovery from domestic powerhouses Avianca and LATAM, has had the strongest civil aviation recovery in the Americas this year.\n\nFlying high\n\nAerocivil released the latest traffic numbers this week, stating that the airlines in this country carried 31.6 million passengers between January and August. This number represents an 85.6% increase compared to 2021 levels and a 17% increase compared to 2019 levels prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDomestically, Avianca has carried around eight million passengers, followed by LATAM Colombia, with approximately six million passengers, and Viva Colombia, with about 4.5 million travelers.\n\nThe Colombian civil aviation authorities estimate that, by the end of 2022, close to 46 million passengers will travel to and from the country. If this number is achieved, the traffic levels will grow by nearly 12% compared to 2019, when Colombia received 41.13 million travelers.\n\nGuillermo Fransico Reyes González, Colombia’s new Minister of Transportation, said that the record numbers posted by the South American country are not only an achievement of the airline industry and local authorities “but also a commitment to Colombians, to whom we have to provide increasingly accessible and quality services.”\n\nFrancisco Ospina Ramírez, director of Aerocivil, added that growth presents the country “with enormous challenges to continue strengthening airport infrastructure and operations in general. We are committed to the country and the air connectivity of its people.”\n\nColombia expects to receive up to 44 million passengers this year. Photo: Getty Images.\n\nThe strongest recovery\n\nColombia became the country with the most robust recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the Latin American and Caribbean Air Transport Association (ALTA), Colombia had a 9% increase in international passengers up until July 2022, and a 22% growth in the domestic segment, compared to 2019. Only the Dominican Republic surpassed Colombia in the international segment, with a 16% growth over pre-pandemic levels. Domestically, Colombia was first.\n\nOverall, the Latin American region has had the strongest passenger recovery worldwide (although this does not mean regional airlines are financially recovered from the pandemic). On the contrary, most airlines across the region have experienced financial losses; rising fuel costs, ramping inflation, and the devaluation of local currencies could put some of these airlines in danger of disappearing. Among the airlines that are currently under threat are Viva Colombia, Viva Peru, and Aeromar.\n\nColombia has had the strongest traffic recovery in the region. Photo: Getty Images.\n\nThe voice of the expert\n\nJosé Ricardo Botelho, executive director and CEO of ALTA, recently said that the continued removal of restrictions on international traffic in the Latin American region has been critical to the remarkable recovery of countries such as Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, and Brazil.\n\n“Looking to the future, we know that the population will continue to require air transportation; however, in order to make it truly possible for more people to use this means of transportation, we need to continue reducing costs associated with fees and taxes, as well as continue optimizing regulations that generate inefficiencies,” he added.\n\nHave you traveled recently to Colombia?

    "Colombia May Shoot Itself In The Foot With Ban On Fracking": "The controversial hydrocarbon technique hydraulic fracturing, known as fracking, which sparked the U.S. oil boom catapulting that country to become the largest petroleum producer globally, is drawing considerable attention in Latin America. A major fracking boom is underway in the region’s third largest economy, Argentina, which is driving oil and natural gas production to record highs. Mexico is also embracing the controversial hydrocarbon extraction technique to boost economically crucial petroleum output. Fracking is also under consideration in Bolivia, Chile and Uruguay as Latin American economies, hit hard by the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, struggle to boost growth and government income while reducing soaring poverty. In stark contrast the strife-torn Colombia is seeking to ban fracking with newly appointed leftwing President Gustavo Petro having campaigned on an anti-extractivist platform.\n\nDuring his electoral campaign Colombia’s first ever leftwing president stated he intended to end contracting for oil exploration and ban fracking in the Andean country. This will sharply impact Colombia’s hydrocarbon dependent economy and potentially cut funding for Petro’s planned programs aimed at alleviating poverty. For over a decade Colombia has punched well-above its weight when it comes to hydrocarbon production. Despite a lack of proven oil reserves, which at the end of 2021 amounted to just over 2 billion barrels sufficient for 7.6 years of production, Colombia is Latin America’s third largest oil producer. The expansion of the oil industry over the last two decades, with annual average petroleum output exceeding one million barrels per day for the first time during 2013, saw petroleum become a key economic driver.\n\nCrude oil is Colombia’s largest export responsible for around a third of the Andean country’s total exports by value. Data from Colombian government statistics agency, DANE, shows the Andean country exported $12.1 billion of crude oil and derivative products for the first seven months of 2022. That represents 35% of all exports, which totaled $34.6 billion, for the period, making petroleum Colombia’s single largest export. The peak oil industry body, the Colombian Petroleum Association, estimated the hydrocarbon sector (Spanish) directly contributed $20 trillion Colombian pesos to government coffers during 2021 which was a considerable increase over the $11.5 trillion generated in 2020 but less than the $26.2 trillion paid during 2019. The industry body believes that amount will rise to over $24 trillion pesos for 2022. Those numbers indicate Colombia’s oil industry is responsible for generating around a fifth of government revenue. That underscores the industry’s importance as a source of fiscal income, especially with the Petro administration planning to hike government spending on social programs in an uncertain economic environment weighed down by runaway inflation and fears of a global recession.\n\nRelated: Oil Falls Below $80 As Powell Warns A Recession May Be Looming\n\n\n\nColombia’s endemic lack of proven oil and natural gas reserves, coupled with an absence of large-scale discoveries for two-decades, points to fracking being the only viable means of sustaining the Andean country’s vital hydrocarbon sector. This is especially the case with Colombia’s proven oil reserves set to expire by around 2030 and sooner if production returns to pre-pandemic levels of around 880,000 barrels per day. Since 2017 Colombia has been facing a natural gas crisis, which forced the country to start importing liquified natural gas in December 2017. That further stresses the need for Bogota to focus on bolstering energy security and expanding hydrocarbon reserves, particularly with proven natural gas reserves of nearly 3.164 trillion cubic feet only capable of sustaining production for eight years.\n\nFracking has long been seen as a solution to Colombia’s limited proven hydrocarbon reserves. The U.S. EIA estimates Colombia has at least 5.4 billion barrels of technically recoverable shale oil and 20.1 trillion cubic feet of shale gas in the Middle Magdalena and Llanos Basins alone. Colombia’s highest administrative tribunal the Council of State in a July 2022 ruling overturned its moratorium on hydraulic fracturing, established in 2018, and rejected a lawsuit seeking to ban fracking in Colombia. The court found that the rules implemented by the Duque administration, which left office on 7 August 2022 when Petro was inaugurated, for fracking are legal. The decision opened the door for the commencement of commercial fracking operations in Colombia.\n\nNonetheless, moves are afoot by Petro’s administration to ban fracking in Colombia despite the Council of State of Ruling. The Andean country’s Congress recently held a hearing for Bill 114 of 2022 (Spanish) which seeks to prohibit hydraulic fracturing of the exploitation of unconventional hydrocarbon deposits. The bill is supported by Colombia’s President whose Minister of the Environment and Sustainable Development Susana Muhammad was quoted as stating in local media (Spanish):\n\n“We believe that fracking and unconventional ones are not a path that accelerates the energy transition because it would delay it, has high environmental costs especially in land use, in the use of water and irrigation not known and difficult to know only, as is the impact on the very complex Colombian geology,\"\n\nFor the bill to proceed it must be debated by a congressional commission and discussed in both chambers before approval and authorization by Colombia’s president.\n\nRising uncertainty surrounding fracking saw Colombia’s state-controlled energy company Ecopetrol request permission (Spanish) from the industry regulator, the National Hydrocarbons Agency (ANH – Spanish initials), to suspend its two fracking pilots for 90-days. Ecopetrol, which is the operator, partnered with ExxonMobil to develop two fracking projects in the Middle Magdalena Valley, near the municipality of Puerto Wilches, known as Kale and Platero. The pilots are attracting substantial opposition from the local community, primarily over concerns regarding water contamination. A Barrancabermeja court ruled in the favor of a community organization which sought to end the projects on the basis that Ecopetrol had not consulted with the local community as required by Colombian law. The Administrative Court of Santander later overruled that decision finding the request for prior consultation by the local Afrowilches community was inadmissible. Those events indicate that even if Bill 114 of 2022 is not passed into law considerable opposition to fracking will continue in Colombia, making its introduction fraught with uncertainty, thereby deterring the required investment from energy companies.\n\nBy Matthew Smith for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",

    "Peace and Pesos: How Colombia’s Peace Treaty is Impacted by its Developing Economy": "In 2016, then-president of Colombia Juan Manuel Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for successfully signing and implementing a peace treaty that would bring an end to over 50 years of organized violence from a guerrilla terrorist group, the Armed Revolutionary Forces of Colombia—People’s Army (FARC-EP). The agreement brought a light of hope to the families that have been in a three-way crossfire between the FARC, the Colombian military, and paramilitary groups.\n\nHowever, the peace was short-lived. Slow implementation of the treaty has left power vacuums in rural areas of the country. These gaps have slowly been filled by over 30 new rebel groups that have emerged since 2016. Although some groups are formed by former FARC members who decided to not civilize, there are also new members who believe the rebels offer better pay and benefits than if they were to work in the urban and rural areas of the developing country. These organizations are known as Residual Organized Armed Groups (GAOR).\n\nOrigins and Violence\n\nFARC was created in 1964 out of Colombia’s Communist Party to represent the rights of the rural population following the Colombian Civil War. By the 1970s, the group funded its operations from ransoms of kidnapped elites, illegal mining, and the production of cocaine. Although the business provided them with a great amount of wealth, it made them a public enemy of the United States as well as drug-traffickers in the eyes of the national population. At its height in 2002, FARC was estimated to have close to 20,000 active members. By 2014, they generated between US$150 million and US$600 million per year in gross revenue.\n\nThe peace treaty in 2016 was not the first attempt in which the government tried to reach an accord with FARC. In 1984, they agreed to a ceasefire for the first time under the Uribe Accord. In it, FARC and the Colombian Communist Party cofounded the Patriotic Union (UP). Although the party achieved initial success, the group weaponized itself again when 200 to 500 UP leaders were assassinated between 1984 and 1988. During this time, several paramilitary groups formed as an attempt by the elite to defend itself against FARC kidnappings, which occurred in spite of the accord. The main paramilitary group, United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), worked closely with the military to exterminate the rebel group once the deal failed. Although partially funded by wealthy landowners, the group found great wealth through the coca business. At the end of the 1980s, the second largest rebel group in the nation, M19, decided to disarm and form its own political party. This group had previously invaded the Palace of Justice, killing eleven of the country’s twenty-five justices.\n\nBy the end of the century, Colombia’s campesinos (poor farmers) experienced violence by FARC, AUC, and the Colombian military. FARC would claim that some farmers were AUC supporters, while AUC would claim that they were FARC supporters. The military used an incentive system of FARC death counts for holidays and bonuses—in practice, this meant that any corpse would be claimed as a rebel. The homicide rate during this time was close to 60 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants. In 2021, it was 26.8 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants.\n\nAfter social protests against national violence, FARC agreed to enter again in peace talks with the government. These talks did not last due to a change in presidential administration in 2002. By 2006, AUC was officially disbanded through a peace deal instigated by the US, who saw them as an international terrorist organization. In 2012, the government reached out once again to talk with FARC about peace negotiations. Existing rebel groups like Ejército de Liberación Nacional (ELN) and Ejército Popular de Liberación (EPL) still exist and continue to combat each other.\n\nFARC-Colombia Peace Accord\n\nNot everyone in Colombia wanted the current peace treaty to be signed. The first referendum failed with 50.2 percent of votes against. The main opposition came from the Democratic Center party, which argued that the treaty gave too many benefits to those who caused over 260,000 deaths since 1964 through their historic violence. These benefits included a special court and law for former rebels, temporary monthly stipends, and 10 seats in the national congress until 2022 for their new political party. The peace court (Special Jurisdiction for Peace) would mean that offenses of rebels will not be tried as criminal, giving way for the possibility of former FARC members avoiding formal prison time. The stipend was seen as an incentive by the government for killers. After some slight alterations, the current deal was signed with no referendums. The amended treaty limits the Colombian peace court to 10 years of operations and President Santos ensures that the former rebels will be appropriately punished. The temporary stipend was seen as unemployment support as rebels were trained to reintegrate into society.\n\nThe guerilla group was officially disbanded with the signature of the peace accord. Around 7,000 rebels turned in their weapons to the UN and are now represented in national politics as Comunes (common people party).\n\nHowever, the implementation of the treaty has been slow since the new administration gained power. The current president Ivan Duque is leader of the Democratic Center party. Although he blames the pandemic or an economic crisis for the sluggish implementation of the treaty, it seems highly unlikely that there is a political will to keep expanding the promises. Reports claim that Duque has put in action an additional 8 percent of the accord implementation, leaving it at 30 percent of its full potential. Corruption also does not help, with an estimated US$119 million lost to government officials since the treaty was signed.\n\nPesos over Peace: the Conundrum for Campesinos\n\nThe agreement—officially called Final Agreement to End the Armed Conflict and Build a Stable and Lasting Peace—focused on different aspects of the complex social problem, such as rural reforms, political participation, group deweaponization, drug trafficking solutions, and means of justice and reparations. By 2018, there had been little improvement in the reintegration of the former FARC members through educational and mental health treatments. This was worrisome given that the unemployment benefits that the members got were about to expire in 2019. Although some wanted to become farmers, the government did not provide a program to ease transition and access to the industry. As a result, close to 1,500 ex-members have become dissidents.\n\nThe promised rural development goals have also stagnated. Duque’s neoliberal approach to growth has focused on empowering large agro-industrial farms to employ the farmers. The results, however, have been disappointing—there has been a historic trend of only minimal job creations from these large companies. Duque has also disbanded different agencies set up to promote rural development, merging them all with the Department of Agriculture. This is problematic since the department has a history of supporting larger industrial farms over the needs of the campesinos. Underdevelopment of rural regions has led to problems such as illicit crop cultivation and violence from militants.\n\nThe outcome of this political disarray is the formation and invasions of GAORs in the country. The lack of access to opportunities along with the little political will allowed the country to lose control of dissident groups. These new groups have different ideals yet they all have one common goal: pesos. Unlike the FARC, there is no claim of a greater social agenda to support rural communities—only supply and demand.\n\nFor the rural towns neglected by the government, these groups represent sources of support. A town on the mountainous border with Venezuela exemplifies the conflict. Coca leaves are the main crop of Catatumbo, a town with little transportation infrastructure and remote location that makes it difficult to trade and grow regular crops. The residents claim they have tried to grow other agricultural goods such as coffee or cocoa, yet coca leaves are the only crop with enough demand for people to go to the village and collect them. They do not want to grow these leaves but it is the only profitable option. The result is constant conflict between different rebel groups that try to take control of the town, as well as the military, which adds to local fears. In the local school, there are posters and banners explaining to children what to do in case they stumble upon a landmine or an unactivated grenade. For these people, their only hope is for the government to provide better infrastructure and opportunities for growth.\n\nYet the government does not support them. The townspeople have had to take it upon themselves to toll those entering town so that they can perform maintenance over what little road they have. Additionally, Duque attempted to reinstate aerial fumigation practices to damage illicit crops. These not only damage legal commodities but could also have adverse health implications for the campesinos. Most importantly, it damages the only meaningful source of income that they have: coca. The country’s Constitutional Court prohibited the administration from advancing these plans until more consultations are done with experts and affected communities.\n\nFor these forgotten towns in rural Colombia, the offer to grow coca leaves and sell it to the guerilla group in their area for profit is sometimes their only option. If the farmers refuse to grow the crop, they are killed. If farmers are accused by any of the rebel groups of supporting other groups, they are killed. If the military suspects the townspeople of actively aiding a group, chances are that they will be killed or detained. This creates a devastating reality in which rebel groups become the center of economic stability for rural towns; if the government removes them from these localities without alternative development measures, it is the economy and livelihoods of the residents that suffer.\n\nHowever, this stability is only temporary. These groups come into constant conflict due to invasions of each other’s territory. This is the case in Colombia’s southern region of Putamayo, in which GAOR Comandos de la Frontera have been in conflict with another GAOR, Carolina Ramirez. In these cases, the towns become battlefields where many civilian lives are lost. Around 10 percent of the country is in territory claimed by one of the rebel groups.\n\nDilemmas of a Fragile Economy\n\nAnother aspect of the larger social issues is the weak national economy. With total employment at 22 million and a labor force of 24 million, there is an oversupply of labor for available opportunities. The effects are lower wages and high unemployment, the latter of which stood close to 10 percent in 2019.\n\nColombia experienced a recent drop in its gross domestic product, with its growth in 2020 being -6.8 percent. The causes can be associated with the disruptions that COVID-19 pandemic created in the global trade and supply chain. These shocks make it difficult for the government to focus on the former rebels in addition to the general population. As a result, Colombia’s economy is not able to sufficiently reward its workers. The combination of the two factors have led to a lack of opportunities for farmers and urban citizens, which makes joining one of the GOARs an attractive opportunity. These groups pay well and even offer vacation time to its militants.\n\n“One [of the members of the new rebel groups] was a single mother who couldn’t raise her children on the $90 a month she made as a housekeeper; another was a former FARC fighter who had discovered he could make twice as much as the unit’s doctor than he could at a public hospital.” - New York Times\n\nColombia has had some overall growth in its economy, with poverty rates falling by 15 percentage points between 2008 and 2017 (27 percent in 2017). It has also had a decent GDP growth of 3.8 percent before the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Colombia’s high inequality, with a Gini coefficient of 54.2 in 2020, has diverted that growth from the lower classes. In return, many have looked for alternatives in the informal sector, which employs 62.1 percent of the labor market. However, others have looked for more lucrative—and hostile—ways of creating an income.\n\nFuture Outlooks\n\nThe peace treaty brought hope to many of the people who have greatly suffered from the conflicts of cocaine in the country. Although it came with excitement, there are some factors that have not allowed it to succeed at its full potential. The lack of political will by government officials to fulfill the terms of the agreement can be explained by the disapproval within the current party’s leadership, as well as internal corruption which has impeded intended allocations to integration efforts. However, the increase in productivity of rural areas, which is a bipartisan policy,has also not been implemented effectively. This raises questions as to why the government has not taken the initiative to empower its campesinos. The developing economy of the country also hinders the prospect of peace due to the large returns that narcotraffic has and the scarcity of job opportunities available for the population in urban and rural areas. The delay in the implementation of the accord has led to a rise in the number of rebel groups that compete for rural land and labor to buy coca leaves. Although many farmers disagree with the practices, it is the only effective means that they have to sustain themselves.\n\nGreater urban development and programs that increase productivity and ease transportation of goods in the rural areas will directly support farmers. Campesinos must be given viable options through which they can develop and outgrow the shadow of narcotrafficking. The government has spent too many resources treating the effects of its social troubles rather than focusing on its root causes: underdevelopment. This idea expands further than mere GDP growth. Addressing inequality without greatly disrupting domestic investments would greatly help strengthen the domestic market, which could raise wages and salaries. Having a military that is more regulated will allow citizens to trust them once again, creating greater collaboration to remove rebel groups from towns. Having a government that is more transparent through harsher consequences for corruption will also lead to greater trust from the public. Attracting more foreign direct investment as well as implementing effective policies to grow human capital will create better jobs for the population. As more effective pathways for financial stability are present for everyone, it will make it much harder for rebel groups to recruit soldiers and fund its operations. Effectively, Colombia’s path for peace is through pesos.",

Now they want to cooperate on security issues, on trade, on immigration issues.\n\nFADEL: Now, Venezuela right now is considered the second-largest external displacement crisis in the world. So what does this border opening mean for Venezuelans who are trying to leave their country?\n\nRUEDA: Well, the hope is that with more trade, the economy improves somewhat. When the border last functioned normally back in 2014, trade between both countries was worth about $2 billion each year. So perhaps, you know, this helps businesses on both sides of the border to exchange with each other the raw materials that they need to get manufacturing up and running again. So maybe that generates some jobs. And maybe that means that some people might want to stay in the country now. But the situation is still quite difficult. I mean, the minimum wage in Venezuela right now is about $16 a month. So when you actually go on a road that leads into the center of Colombia, you can still find many people from Venezuela just walking, walking towards the center of Colombia because they don't have money to pay for the bus. And one of the people I met was a 21-year-old man called Elio Sanabria (ph). And this is what he said.\n\nELIO SANABRIA: (Non-English language spoken).\n\nRUEDA: So what he's saying there is that he was working at a chicken plant in Venezuela. And his wage was $20 a month. And he says, you know, this is just no way to live. You just have to live day to day. There's barely enough money for food. And so he was trying to head to Chile, where he has some friends who told him they might be able to help him find work there.\n\nFADEL: So some possible hope for some alleviation of those economic struggles in Venezuela. But beyond Venezuela, what does the border opening mean for this region of South America?\n\nRUEDA: So Gustavo Petro, the new president of Colombia, is trying to improve relations with Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela. And the border opening is just part of a broader plan he has. His main interest - Petro's main interest is to generate peace talks with different rebel groups that still exist in Colombia. But he needs Maduro's help because many of those groups also operate in Venezuela. So will the relationship go to that level where Maduro will help him to make peace with the rebel groups? We'll have to see.\n\nFADEL: Reporter Manuel Rueda is in Cucuta, Colombia. Thank you so much for your reporting.\n\nRUEDA: Sure. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",
    "Part 1: Colombia's advertisers recognise their agencies great work": "Scopen's Agency Scope 2022 in Colombia reconfirms the great potential of this market, which has historically surprised with its high satisfaction levels in advertiser-agency relations.\n\nSource © Flavia Carpio Unsplash Scopen's Agency Scope 2022 reconfirms the great potential of the Colombian market\n\nThe following positive results are revealed in Scopen’s Agency Scope 2022 study in Colombia.\n\nSatisfaction of advertisers with their creative and media agencies\n\nAll indicators related to advertisers´ evaluation of their agencies are highly positive, and even better than those obtained in past editions, which were already good.\n\nAdvertisers declare themselves much more satisfied than in 2020 (43.6% declare themselves \"very satisfied\" with their creative agencies. 13.3% more than in 2020 and 39.6% with their media agencies - 10% points more than in the last edition).\n\nDue to this great satisfaction, the predisposition to change has decreased: 75.5% of advertisers will most definitely not change their creative agency and 76.9% their media agency (20 points more in 2020 in both cases).\n\nAll this reflects the great work that agencies are doing for advertisers. Of 47 service attributes analysed, in 32 of them, creative agencies are better valued than in the last edition; and of 35 attributes, media agencies evolve positively in 27 of them (especially in the digital area).\n\nAnd, not only that, but advertisers consider that their agencies are contributing more and more to the growth of their businesses (in both cases with a percentage close to 30%). That almost a third of business growth is due to the agency´s work reflects the importance that the advertising industry has when it comes to its clients ' businesses, and the great work they do together.\n\nConsequently, advertisers recommend their agencies to a greater extent (NPS grows by 15 points for both creative and media agencies) and advertiser-agency relationships are consolidated, both in duration (average duration grows by half a year) and, in the relationship model, becoming more and more ongoing and less for specific projects.\n\nThe great positioning that agencies have achieved in the minds of advertisers\n\nWhen we ask advertisers about their current internal challenges, they remain the same as in the past: strengthening their prestige and perception in the market and adapting to the new times.\n\nHowever, they are increasingly concerned about understanding their consumers and how to reach them, and betting internally on creativity, innovation and digital.\n\nOnce they´ve declared their challenges, we ask them which companies (agencies, media, platforms, consultants, etc.) they consider could help them face these challenges, and this is where the great change lies compared to the past.\n\nIt is no longer the large digital platforms that dominate the top positions (as was the case in 2020 and is still the case in most of the markets where we carry out the Agency Scope), but rather the most mentioned creative and media agencies.\n\nAdvertisers consider that they are the ones who can and have to help them overcome their challenges. They trust them and see them as responsible for this help.\n\nAnother point we ask advertisers is if, of all the agencies they work with, regardless of their profile, they consider any of them as their \"lead agency\" (an agency that leads the communication of their company and is the one that coordinates the rest of partners). In just six years, the percentage of customers who confirm this has almost doubled, increasing from 24% to 46%.\n\nThe agencies have positioned themselves internally with their clients, not just as providers of communication and marketing services, but as partners capable of leading, coordinating and implementing. The internal reinforcement that the agencies have made in key areas such as data, strategy and digital, has resulted in the current better positioning.\n\nAdvertisers´ in-house movement loses strength\n\nHistorically, Colombia has been a market in which important advertisers worked internally on their communication. When people began to talk about this trend in the UK we had already seen it in Colombia. It was a big concern for the agencies. Their competitors were no longer so much other agencies or consultancies or digital platforms, but rather their own clients.\n\nHowever, in this edition, we observe how advertisers work less in marketing areas and disciplines internally. And not only that but, compared to the rest of the markets, Colombia is behind when it comes to in-house services.\n\nThe great work of agencies with advertisers, their constant evolution in areas such as data, and business strategy among others, and the \"bad experiences\" of some advertisers that have tried out this trend, have been the main reasons behind this change. Work carried out by the agencies, their knowledge, their contribution are very complex to internalise.",
    "Colombia’s trailblazing vice president: Black, female and champion of the ‘nobodies’": "Shovel and wooden pan in hand, rubber boots hoisted up to his shins, Leider Ocoró Ambuila strolled past the zapote tree, past the stands of ripening bananas, past the cow pen, down to the banks of the Ovejas river.\n\nLeider Ocoró Ambuila, 41, pans for gold in the Ovejas river in La Toma, Colombia. He says he played as a child with Francia Elena Márquez, who also panned for gold there. (Liliana Nieto del Río / For The Times)\n\nHe was soon crouched at waterway’s edge shoveling silt into a concave pan, or batea, a ritual passed down for generations. He splashed water on the grit and tilted the pan to help separate mud and pebbles from the real stuff — gold, minuscule flecks of which soon sparkled from the muck.\n\n“Francia also worked hard to find gold,” said Ocoró Ambuila, 41. “I grew up with her. We played together. She is one of us.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn these remote parts, where destiny is shaped by water and gold, the reference was clear: Francia Elena Márquez, the most eminent, and provocative, citizen of La Toma, a string of villages and farmsteads spread over verdant hills and valleys that is home to some 8,000 people, overwhelmingly of African ancestry. Most are descendants of slaves brought to South America centuries ago by the Spanish to work in mines and on plantations.\n\nThe view from a hilltop in La Toma, Colombia, hometown of Vice President Francia Elena Márquez. (Liliana Nieto del Río / For The Times)\n\nMárquez is a single mother and former live-in maid who escaped rural poverty and threats to become an outspoken social activist — winner of the Goldman Prize, the so-called environmental Nobel, awarded for her battle against large-scale illegal gold mining.\n\nToday, Márquez, 40, sits improbably as Colombia’s vice president. She took office last month alongside President Gustavo Petro, 62, an ex-urban guerrilla and the first leftist chief executive of this nation of 50 million, long a key U.S. strategic ally.\n\nThe meteoric rise and ballot-box draw of Márquez — her charismatic appeal with minority, female and young voters helped boost Petro over the top in his third presidential bid — is a singular development, even at a moment when the left is again on the upswing in Latin America.\n\nPresident Gustavo Petro greets Vice President Francia Elena Márquez as Senate President Roy Barreras, left, and Chamber of Representatives President David Racero look on during the Aug. 7 inauguration in Bogota. (Guillermo Legaria / Getty Images)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMárquez, who had never before held elective office, is the first person of African heritage to attain such a high post in Colombia, a country where discussion of race has mostly been muted, if not taboo. That is often the case in Latin America, where racism has persisted, typically in a less institutional, albeit no less insidious, manner than in the United States.\n\nHer high-profile advocacy has placed Márquez at the vanguard of an awakening of identity — and push for equality — among the country’s long-marginalized Afro-Colombian masses, who officially tally less than 10% of Colombia’s population. Advocates call that a vast undercount, reflecting centuries of neglect.\n\nColombian Vice President Francia Elena Márquez takes part in a ritual during a traditional ceremony in her home municipality of Suarez on Aug. 13, 2022. (Joaquin Sarmiento/ AFP/Getty Images)\n\n“People of African descent are at the bottom of the pyramid in terms of inequality,” said Helmer Quiñones, an activist who wears a Black Lives Matter pin on his lapel. “Francia Márquez is not the first great political leader in Colombia of African descent. But she also has a global profile, not just domestic.”\n\nMárquez’s big jewelry and multi-patterned outfits have emerged as a style point for admirers from backgrounds rural and urban, poor and wealthy. Her face stares from flamboyant wall murals, many proclaiming her campaign slogan: “Vivir sabroso” — roughly, live life to the fullest.\n\nAfro-Colombians were major participants in nationwide protests last year against what was then a conservative government. The massive street mobilizations, and police violence against protesters, set the stage for a “change” agenda in this year’s national voting.\n\nStill, many didn’t take Márquez’s chances seriously last year when she announced her bid for the presidency. But, in a March primary of the leftist Historic Pact coalition, she garnered almost 800,000 votes.\n\nPeople in Suarez, Colombia, watch the inauguration of President Gustavo Petro and Vice President Francia Elena Márquez\n\non Aug. 7, 2022. (Joaquin Sarmiento / AFP/Getty Images)\n\nPetro, a sitting senator and former mayor of Bogota, the capital, won the primary and named Márquez his running mate; in a June runoff, the pair narrowly beat a conservative businessman. Their platform vowed social and political reformation of a nation battered by decades of civil war, narco-violence and deepening inequality.\n\nMárquez calls herself a champion of the “nobodies” — the county’s Black and Indigenous minorities, the poor, working-class women and others at the fringes of a nation historically dominated by a white-mestizo male elite based in the cool Andean climes of Bogota. Most of Colombia’s Afro-descendant peoples hail from the torrid zones along the Pacific and Caribbean coasts.\n\nBeyond race, Márquez has unabashedly challenged sexism, classism, inequality and gender prejudice, among other incendiary topics. She has weathered threats against her life, racist taunts and denied allegations of links to armed guerrillas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInternationally, Márquez has developed a kind of rock-star following as a fearless crusader for environmental, racial and gender justice, climate change and other timely issues.\n\n“I am part of the struggle against structural racism,” she declared in her 2018 Goldman Prize speech in San Francisco. “Among those women who raise their voices to stop the destruction of rivers, forests and wetlands. Among those who dream that, one day, all human beings are going to change the economic model of death to an economic model of life.”\n\nHer critics label her a divisive figure who deploys multicultural rhetoric to mask a lack of government experience in her ambitious march to the Casa de Narino, the presidential palace.\n\nA man holds a cardboard cutout of Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro and Vice President Francia Elena Márquez in Bogota on Aug. 7, 2022. (Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\n“It’s very convenient for her and her followers to construct a defensive wall that characterizes as racist or classist any type of criticism,” Luis Guillermo Vélez, an opposition politician, wrote during the presidential campaign. “Francia Márquez’s personal story may be admirable.... But that doesn’t exempt her from responding to questions about her political ideas.”\n\nAfter less than two months in office, Márquez’s exact role in the new administration remains largely undefined, a fact that has unsettled some of her supporters. Márquez has pushed for the creation of a Ministry of Equality, with her at the helm. But that has yet to happen as Petro faces various daunting challenges, notably pacifying a deeply polarized nation.\n\n“The time has come to build peace, a peace that implies social justice,” Márquez said after the election.\n\nMárquez’s activist roots lie here in La Toma, one of a number of predominantly Afro-Colombian townships in Colombia’s southwestern Cauca department.\n\nThe region’s breathtaking beauty belies a harsh reality: It is a largely lawless, conflict-ridden zone where narco-traffickers harvest swaths of coca and marijuana, wildcat miners poison waterways and fell forests, and sundry armed groups — guerrillas, killers for hire, paramilitaries, criminal bands — hold sinister sway and grab land.\n\nColombia perennially ranks among the world’s most perilous places for activists protecting land and water resources. Scores are killed each year. And Cauca is ground zero.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the people of La Toma and environs, gold mining has historically been a key source of income, supplementing subsistence farming. But gold, and gold fever, have inevitably spurred conflict.\n\nResidents of La Toma have long practiced both alluvial mining — panning in the Ovejas for gold washed down from the hills — and digging for ore in tunnels cut deep into dirt and rock.\n\nIn an autobiographical article for Colombia’s El Espectador newspaper, Márquez recalled that Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays were always dedicated to family gold mining. When she finished primary school, Márquez wrote, her mother — a midwife who had 11 children — said there was no money for further studies. But an aunt invited the young Márquez to work in a mine, a job that provided cash to buy a school uniform, books and cover other educational costs.\n\n“She was very studious, very extroverted and very involved with her process of education,” said Azael Balanta, 54, who was Márquez’s primary school teacher in her home village, Yolombo, one of five villages that make up La Toma, part of the municipality of Suárez. “But I never thought that the Francia Elena who was my student would so quickly become vice president of the Republic of Colombia.”\n\nLa Toma, Márquez wrote in El Espectador, has a history of land battles. Her grandfather and other elders were thrown into jail in a dispute with a landlord. Relatives gathered gold to pay a lawyer to help free them.\n\n“The struggle in my territory, in my community ... has passed from generation to generation,” Márquez wrote.\n\nIn her youth, she wrote, outsiders would casually fling racist insults — “You are descendants of slaves.” Or: “You come from Africa, a miserable place.”\n\nEarly on, Márquez also heard about environmental injustice. The 1980s construction of the Salvajina Dam, on the Cauca River, near La Toma, was widely condemned. The project flooded the lands of thousands of Afro-Colombian and other farmers and devastated traditional fishing, mining and agricultural activities, residents say.\n\nAs a teenager, Márquez joined her La Toma neighbors in protesting a multinational company’s plan to divert the Ovejas river — La Toma’s essential water source — to boost power for the Salvajina Dam.\n\nThe rising price of gold eventually drew the interest of multinational companies and others keen to cash in on the area’s treasures. Márquez became a plaintiff in a 2010 lawsuit alleging that Colombian authorities had awarded mining rights in La Toma without soliciting community input, as required by law. Colombia’s highest court agreed and suspended the concessions, a major victory — and a signal to Márquez that the legal system could be an ally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople work at a street market in Suarez, Colombia. (Joaquin Sarmiento / AFP/Getty Images)\n\nStill, the situation in La Toma and surrounding areas was becoming more fraught. In April 2010, gunmen killed eight miners along the Ovejas. Residents blamed right-wing paramilitary forces in the employ of mining interests. Authorities pointed to leftist guerrillas who impose extortion fees on anyone mining on their turf.\n\nSoon, a rash of bulldozers and backhoes moved into La Toma, tearing up the riverbank and hillsides in search of gold. Gunmen threatened anyone who stood in the miners’ way, residents said. The influx worsened deforestation and increased dumping into the Ovejas of mercury and cyanide, two highly toxic chemicals widely used to separate gold from rock.\n\nThe mass intrusion into La Toma provided the impetus for Márquez’s signature act: In November 2014, she burst onto the national stage leading a march of 80 Black women — known as the March of the Turbans, after their African-inspired head attire — from La Toma to Bogota, more than 300 miles away, protesting the presence of the illegal miners.\n\nThe demonstrators remained outside the Interior Ministry for three weeks, demanding a solution. Finally, the government relented and agreed to evict the illegal miners.\n\nBy then, Márquez was a single mother of two, and had received threats. Joining the ranks of millions of Colombians displaced by violence, she had left vulnerable La Toma for the city of Cali, home to a large Afro-Colombian population, and began studying law.\n\nIn 2015, Márquez received a national human rights award. Three years later, she won the Goldman Prize, which thrust her into international prominence.\n\n“She overcame sexism, racism and corruption to lead La Toma’s struggle,” the Goldman citation said. Not long afterward, while working at cleaning houses, Márquez told a newspaper editor: “I’m going to be president one day.”\n\nIn La Toma, reached on a bumpy two-hour drive from the nearest major city, Márquez is a figure of adulation. She has also raised some modest expectations — that running water will finally be widely available, that more roads will be paved, that educational opportunities will improve, that the pervasive sense of insecurity will diminish.\n\nA mural portrays Colombian Vice President Francia Elena Márquez in Suarez. (Joaquin Sarmiento / AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We want to be able to keep on studying to become better people, just like Francia did,” said Doris Adriana Ocoró, 22, a nursing student who was panning for gold on a recent morning with her husband, as her daughter, 3, watched. “We have learned a lot from Francia, and from our ancestors.”\n\nOver at the Santa Rosa de Lima school, students said Márquez’s ascension had also inspired them. At an outdoor musical performance, Jinller Leany, 12, and Andrea Torres, 15, sang a song about dignity and pride:\n\nI was born Black and my companion is the sun\n\nTo the rhythm of the marimba and first the drum\n\nMy name is African mixed with Spanish ...\n\nI am proud of my race and I give thanks to God\n\nProud of my race and I give thanks to God\n\nBlack I was born, and Black I am.\n\nSpecial correspondents Liliana Nieto del Río in La Toma and Cecilia Sánchez in Mexico City contributed to this report.",

    "Colombia: Nonviolent Journalism book launched": "This post is also available in: Spanish\n\nStudents, journalists and nonviolence activists met at the launch of the book Nonviolent Journalism in Bogotá and talked with its authors about the importance of thinking about new forms of journalistic practice in Latin America, especially in the moment of transition that Colombia is experiencing.\n\nThe FES headquarters in Colombia welcomed the authors and those interested in learning about the proposal of nonviolent journalism presented by the International News Agency Pressenza and published in the Colombian edition together with FES Comunicación and Ediciones Desde Abajo.\n\nThe event, presented by Omar Rincón, representative of FES Comunicación and moderated by Iñaki Chaves, from Desde Abajo and contributor to the Colombian edition, allowed Pía Figueroa, Nelsy Lizarazo and Javier Tolcachier, three of the five authors of the book, to discuss its different aspects and some of the most relevant pedagogical proposals.\n\nA book for the public\n\n“Nonviolent Journalism: a humanising approach to communication” is both a manual that can be read by anyone and implemented in faculties of social communication and journalism, as it contributes to the deconstruction and subsequent construction of a style of journalism that departs from the traditional violent scheme, to look for a way of communicating at the grassroots in which the human being is valued.\n\nThe book is being presented in a time when Colombia is betting on peace, and for this reason, Nelsy Lizarazo affirmed that “the book is a valuable contribution to the possibility of strengthening a strong line of journalism that allows the recommendations of the Truth Commission to become a reality and for the country to achieve the peace desired by all.”\n\nFor his part, Javier Tolcachier spoke of the need to create new narratives that give a different look at reality and do not shy away from investigating and writing about issues that are outside the news agenda of the traditional media and which are of great relevance to the population.\n\nNonviolent journalism beyond the label\n\nJournalism has been subject to various classifications to indicate the approach taken to the reporting of events and audiovisual content, as well as the treatment of sources. However, the five authors go beyond categorisation and seek to ensure that journalism transcends digital barriers to reach every reader.\n\nIn this way, those who access the material may have another point of view on some assertions such as the inherent violence in human beings as a form of defence or survival; although this type of violence only deepens social rifts, generating greater violence and victimisation in society.\n\nFinally, Pía Figueroa reported that, in addition to the different editions of the book, “the first virtual course on nonviolent journalism in English is underway with students from several countries.” Thus, Pressenza hopes to be able to replicate this experience in other languages.\n\nFigueroa announced that this year the English version of the book will be released and there are plans to translate the text into German, Portuguese, Greek, Italian and, soon, French, and possibly also in Mandarin.",

    "Never forget my roots: Alfredo Rodriguez, civil engineer": "At the age of 24, Alfredo Rodriguez moved from Bogotá, Colombia, to the U.S. to start a whirlwind adventure that would take him around the country and lead him full circle to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas City District, as a civil engineer working in water management.\n\nRodriguez moved to Overland Park, Kansas, from Colombia in 1985 to live with his parents. He arrived with three things – knowledge of roughly four English words, a civil engineering degree from the Colombian School of Engineering Julio Garavito and the desire to make a life for himself in the U.S.\n\nRodriguez lived in Kansas for around five months before moving to Texas. During those five months, he had to learn English. His first step was to attend language classes at a local college.\n\n“Then, I took a job at a grocery store packing bags. My only purpose for doing that, even though I already had a civil engineering degree, was to learn English,” Rodriguez said. “When they teach it in school, you learn the proper English, and then you go to the street, and talk to people and all that goes out the window and then you [actually] learn.”\n\nWhen he got to Texas, he discovered his love for water after his brother, who has a master’s degree and Ph.D. in water resources, introduced him to reservoirs. He liked it so much that he got his master’s in water resources from the University of Texas and started his professional journey.\n\nFrom 1993 to 2015, he held engineering positions in Texas and Colorado, working for state, city and private consultants. He also learned about USACE.\n\n“I didn’t know the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers existed, until I started working for the water development board in Texas,” Rodriguez said.\n\nHe partnered with USACE during his time with the board and learned how they operated and maintained reservoirs in the region. This piqued his interest.\n\n“There are things you love to do and things you like to do. I like to do [engineer] modeling, but I love to do flood operations, flood risk management and reservoir management,” he said.\n\nSo, he looked for a job where he could do those things and got his first job in USACE with the Walla Walla District in March 2015.\n\nRodriguez stayed with the Walla Walla District for six years before he traveled back to Kansas to work for the Kansas City District in March 2021.\n\nIn his seven years with USACE, he’s met people and had experiences that stuck with him.\n\n“USACE is one of the best organizations. It gives you opportunities to move within the organization itself and it gives you the chance to volunteer when disasters happen, which is unfortunate but also so rewarding because you get to know other people and places. You get to learn [just] how different cultures are,” Rodriguez said.\n\nAccording to Rodriguez, he doesn’t think he would have the same experiences if he stayed in Colombia.\n\n“What is neat about the U.S. is it’s given me the opportunity to move to Texas, Colorado, [Washington State], and then back to Kansas, all for jobs,” Rodriguez said. “That opportunity does not exist in Colombia. It is very rare… because of the economy, the politics and security of the country. Here [in the U.S.], opportunities are abundant, and I love this country.”\n\nThough he loves his life in the U.S., he never forgets where he is from and celebrates his heritage by sharing it with others.\n\n“I’ve been lucky enough to take the best of both of my worlds and make it the best for me – I will never forget my roots,\" he said.",
