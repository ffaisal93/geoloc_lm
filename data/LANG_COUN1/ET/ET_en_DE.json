    "Germany sued over air pollution levels": "German citizens are suing their government over its failure to bring down air pollution levels to limits recommended by the world's leading scientists.\n\nThe seven claimants, supported by environmental organisations ClientEarth and Deutsche Umwelthilfe [German Environment Help], last week launched the case in the Federal Administrative Court — Germany's highest court.\n\nStudent or retired? Then this plan is for you.\n\nThey argue German law breaches their fundamental rights, since it allows air-pollution levels to be four to five times higher than those the World Health Organization (WHO) deems acceptable.\n\n\"Air pollution may not often be named the official cause of death, but it claims lives — and causes long-term diseases, including cancer, heart problems, shortness of breath and strokes,\" said one of the claimants from Munich, who suffers from asthma.\n\n\"I am now suing for my right to breathe clean and healthy air.\"\n\nThe claimants all come from the country's four most-polluted cities: Berlin, Dusseldorf, Munich and Frankfurt.\n\nWhile the EU set legally-binding air quality standards to tackle air pollution in 2015, the WHO lowered its levels in 2021 — prompting campaigners to urge the EU to align its legislation with science.\n\nThe EU is currently reviewing its main air-quality law, with a proposal expected to come in October.\n\nBut its implementation will not be immediate, meaning EU member states will not be obliged to comply with more strict thresholds for several years.\n\nOver 90 percent of the EU's urban population is exposed to high levels of fine-particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide and ozone above those recommended by the WHO, according to the European Environment Agency.\n\nAnd it is estimated that reducing air pollution to WHO-recommended levels in the EU could prevent 51,213 premature deaths each year.\n\nThere are currently ongoing infringement procedures against 18 member states for failing to implement current EU air-quality rules — including referrals to the European Court of Justice against Romania, Greece, Malta, Italy, and Austria.\n\n\"What's needed here is simple — alignment of national air quality laws with the science laid out by the world's leading experts. This is the bare minimum our leaders should be doing to protect people,\" said Irmina Kotiuk, a lawyer from ClientEarth.\n\nIn the past, climate litigation has successfully led to a reduction in air pollution in Germany.\n\nBetween 2018 and 2019, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels were reduced in several German cities where legal cases over air pollution had been undertaken by environmental groups.\n\nIn the EU, over 400,000 people die prematurely every year as a result of breathing toxic air.",

    "Lindner raises doubts on Germany’s gas levy": "German Finance Minister Christian Lindner questioned whether the gas levy would lead to lower energy prices for consumers | John MacDougall/AFP via Getty Images\n\nGerman Finance Minister Christian Lindner has questioned if efforts to help the country's energy companies tackle soaring energy costs would lead to lower energy prices for local consumers.\n\nSpeaking to German newspaper Bild am Sonntag, Lindner, the head of the country's liberal Free Democratic Party, said the so-called gas levy, the plan to charge Germans a fee to compensate energy companies for skyrocketing wholesale energy costs because of the war in Ukraine, may not be the best way to handle the global energy crisis.\n\n\"We have a gas levy that increases the price,\" Lindner said in an interview published on Sunday. \"But we need a gas price brake that lowers the price.\"\n\nThe gas levy, which is due to come into force on October 1, became a political hot potato between members of Germany's coalition government as soon as it was first proposed by Robert Habeck, the country's energy minister and member of the Green party.\n\nDespite rising cost-of-living concerns for average German voters, the levy was designed to help profit-making energy companies, some of which have recorded blockbuster income amid rising global prices for natural gas. Estimates suggest an average German four-person household will pay €480 more a year to cover the planned levy.\n\nLindner raised concerns about whether such a surcharge would have the designed effect of helping to support those energy companies, often smaller outfits, that were struggling to pay rapidly increasing wholesale energy prices.\n\n\"It's less a question of law when it comes to the gas levy, but more and more of a question of economic reasoning,\" Lindner said. \"A gas price brake must help everyone in the economy quickly.\"",

    "Recession clouds gather in Germany, Europe’s largest economy": "FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Europe’s largest economy is sending recession signals.\n\nGermany’s key future indicator, the IFO survey of business confidence, pointed down for the fourth month in a row as high inflation fed by astronomical natural gas prices undermines consumer pricing power and imposes heavy costs on businesses .\n\nThe index compiled by the Munich-based Ifo institute dropped to 84.3 in September from 88.5 in August, to its lowest level since the global financial crisis more than a decade ago.\n\n“High energy and commodity prices are weighing on demand and putting pressure on profit margins,” said Carsten Brzeski, chief eurozone economist at ING bank. “Companies can no longer pass through higher costs to consumers as easily as in the first months of the year.”\n\nCompany order books are shrinking, while businesses that use a lot of energy, such as bakeries, are facing costs that make them question whether they can stay in business .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe news comes as more economists predict a recession for Europe as a whole. Germany was heavily dependent on cheap natural gas from Russia , which has cut back supplies to a small fraction of what they were before the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. Gas is used to keep homes warm, run factories and generate electricity.\n\nEuropean officials say the cutbacks are an attempt to pressure governments out of their strong support for Ukraine and for economic sanctions against Russia.\n\nOfficials have lined up new supplies of more expensive liquefied gas that can come by ship from countries including the U.S. rather than by pipeline from Russia. But experts say Europe will still need to make a serious effort ahead of the winter heating season to conserve gas .\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz was in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar over the weekend and signed some energy deals .",
    "Russia and Germany to fall into recession as global economic outlooks darkens, OECD predicts": "Russia's invasion of Ukraine, soaring energy bills and record-breaking inflation have thrown the global economy into disarray, triggering an \"extended period of subdued growth,\" according to the latest forecast by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\n\nGermany, the EU's industrial powerhouse, is projected to fall into recession next year.\n\n\"The global growth outlook has darkened,\" the OECD said, in a report titled \"Paying the Price of War\"released on Monday morning.\n\nThe study paints a bleak picture of the world economy: business confidence, disposable incomes and household expenditure all plummet while the costs of fuels, food and transportation surge.\n\nInflation has become \"broad-based\" and will gradually ease throughout 2023, but still remain exceptionally high, as tighter financial conditions resulting from steep hikes in interest rates slowly yield results.\n\nFor Europe, the forecast is particularly gloomy in the event of a colder-than-usual winter: underground gas storage would be depleted and energy prices would soar, prompting shortages and industrial paralysis.\n\n\"This would push many countries into a full-year recession in 2023,\" the OECD says in the event of winter disruptions and enforced gas reductions.\n\nThe organisation also warns of the possibility that the sanctions against Russian oil, one of Moscow's top revenue sources, could prove \"more disruptive than anticipated.\"\n\nThe EU-wide embargo will take effect at the end of the year, taking about two million barrels per day of Russian crude and refined products off the market.\n\nIf Russia is unable to reroute these supplies to other regions, international prices will shoot up, adding even more pressure on the already-volatile energy supply chains.\n\n\"The global economy has lost momentum this year,\" the report notes. \"After bouncing back strongly from the COVID-19 pandemic, a return to a more normal economic situation appeared to be in prospect prior to Russia’s unprovoked, unjustifiable and illegal war of aggression against Ukraine.\"\n\nRussia and Germany head into recession\n\nOf all the countries analysed in the report, Russia is by far the worst-hit: the country, which has been hit by unprecedented Western sanctions, is projected to contract by 5.5% in 2022 and by 4.5% in 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, Germany will end this year with a 1.2% positive expansion but will decline by 0.7% next year. Recession fears are looming large over the country, which until early this year was a large consumer of Russian gas and is now scrambling to find alternative suppliers.\n\n\"The signs of a recession for the German economy are multiplying,\" Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, said last week.\n\nA recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of decline in gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nThe other European economies included in the OECD's study fare slightly better. France, Italy and Spain will see modest growth rates in 2023, at 0.6%, 0.4% and 1.5%, respectively, which means they could too fall into recession at one point but still end the year with moderate positive growth.\n\nThe eurozone will expand by 3.1% in 2022 and by a meagre 0.3% in 2023. Inflation will average 6.2% next year, over three times the 2% target desired by the European Central Bank.\n\nThese pessimistic estimations could deteriorate if the energy crisis takes a turn for the worse.\n\n\"Significant uncertainty surrounds the projections. More severe fuel shortages, especially for gas, could reduce growth in Europe by a further 1.25 percentage points in 2023,\" the OECD says.\n\nSpeaking before the European Parliament on Monday afternoon, ECB President Christine Lagarde also struck an ominous note and warned \"uncertainty remains high.\"\n\n\"The outlook is darkening,\" she told MEPs. \"We expect activity to slow substantially in the coming quarters.\"\n\nBeyond the bloc, the OECD expects the United States to grow by 0.5% next year, while the United Kingdom will post a 0% rate, meaning it will neither expand nor contract.\n\nJapan, Canada, Argentina, Brazil, South Africa and Mexico will all see limited rates, below the 2% mark.\n\nChina, a driving engine of the world economy that is pursuing a strict zero-Covid policy, will expand by 3.2% in 2022 and then speed up to 4.7% in 2023.\n\nOn the other hand, Saudi Arabia appears to enjoy an economic boom, \"buoyed by high energy prices.\" The oil-rich country is estimated to swell by almost 10% this year and 6% next year.\n\nOverall, the world economy will grow by 3% in 2022 and 2.2% in 2023, a downward revision compared to the previous OECD estimate.",

In response to that, the Government of Germany announced today €10 million in new, additional funding to Education Cannot Wait at the Global Citizen Festival.\n\nGermany is the largest donor to Education Cannot Wait, the United Nations global fund for education in emergencies and protracted crises, with almost €330 million in total funding to date.\n\n“The international community urgently needs to increase its investments in education. Global Citizens, thank you for raising your voices to call for more support for Education Cannot Wait, so that all young people everywhere in the world will have access to quality education: this will enable us to end extreme poverty - now,\" stated Svenja Schulze, Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany.\n\n“Thank you, Germany! Your inspiring leadership and strong support has taken Education Cannot Wait to the next level. Education is the most crucial investment to make today, to build a more equal, prosperous and peaceful future for all! Through global and local partnerships, we can deliver on our promise of quality education for crisis-affected children and youth, ensuring that no one is left behind,” said Yasmine Sherif, Director of Education Cannot Wait.\n\nThe new contribution connects to Education Cannot Wait’s First Emergency Response grants in Ukraine. The current investments are managed by Save the Children and UNICEF and focus on protecting the wellbeing of Ukraine’s conflict-affected girls and boys, while also ensuring continuous access to education and psychosocial support.\n\nSchools across Ukraine have been the target of repeated attacks throughout the seven-month war. Recent government reports indicate that as many as 2,300 educational institutions had been hit, and over 280 have been destroyed. Millions of refugees have fled into neighboring countries, straining resources, ripping families apart, and denying children and adolescents to their inherent human right to 12 years of quality education.\n\nWith the war in Ukraine, massive displacement in Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and Asia, the compounding impacts of the climate crisis, and global economic uncertainty, the world is facing a worsening global education crisis.\n\nShocking new analysis from ECW indicates that 222 million crisis-impacted girls and boys are in need of urgent education support – up from previous estimates of 75 million in 2016.\n\nIn response to the global education crisis, ECW launched its Case for Investment and 2023-2026 Strategic Plan during this year’s United Nations General Assembly. To make good on promises outlined in the Sustainable Development Goals (especially SDG4 – Education For All), Safe Schools Declaration and other international accords, the Fund is rallying donors and strategic partners to mobilize US$1.5 billion in funding to reach at least 20 million crisis-impacted children and adolescents over the next four years through its #222MillionDreams campaign.\n\nEducation Cannot Wait’s High-Level Financing Conference will take place in Geneva in February 2023. Hosted by Switzerland and Education Cannot Wait – and co-convened by Germany, Niger, Norway and South Sudan – through the 222 Million Dreams campaign, the conference calls on government donors, private sector, foundations and high-net-worth individuals to turn commitments into action by making substantive funding contributions to ECW.\n\nNote to Editors\n\nAbout Education Cannot Wait (ECW):\n\nEducation Cannot Wait (ECW) is the United Nations global fund for education in emergencies and protracted crises. We support quality education outcomes for refugee, internally displaced and other crisis-affected girls and boys, so no one is left behind. ECW works through the multilateral system to both increase the speed of responses in crises and connect immediate relief and longer-term interventions through multi-year programming. ECW works in close partnership with governments, public and private donors, UN agencies, civil society organizations, and other humanitarian and development aid actors to increase efficiencies and end siloed responses. ECW urgently appeals to public and private sector donors for expanded support to reach even more vulnerable children and youth.

    "Refugees: German cities are reaching their limits": "A bitter wind blows across the empty sports fields on the road out of Herzogenrath-Merkstein, a small community in the far west of Germany near Aachen. A few brown leaves whirl over the green grass of the soccer field; the red-colored sand of the running track is wet. On the once-white plaster of the gymnasium, someone has written \"SVS Merkstein,\" the name of the local sports club, in black paint.\n\nBut no sports activities are taking place here at the moment. Instead, the hall is being used to house refugees from the war in Ukraine. In early August, partitions were used to set up temporary accommodation for 80 people. Now the space is full — as are all the other accommodation facilities for refugees in Herzogenrath.\n\nPastor Frank Ungerathen and his team help the refugees in the small community of Herzogenrath\n\nAbout a kilometer down the road from the hall, the refugee advice team sits together for a meeting at the Protestant parish of Lydia. Pastor Frank Ungerathen has just told his colleagues that a second gymnasium will be converted this week. He learned this from the city's social welfare office, which is responsible for taking in and caring for the refugees.\n\nHe and his team had hoped that the situation would not again reach the point it did during the refugee crisis of 2015/2016, when people also had to be accommodated in gym halls and even tents. But there is simply no more housing available in the small city of about 50,000 residents.\n\n\"The housing market has totally dried up,\" said Mahkameh Robatian, who leads the advice center. Private offers to take in refugees are also rare. \"The high prices of gas and electricity mean that people often decline because it becomes too expensive for them,\" said volunteer Olga Meier.\n\nIn any refugee accommodation in Aachen, at least two people share a bedroom\n\nHelpers overwhelmed\n\nSince Russia invaded Ukraine and the first refugees from the war arrived in Germany, the advice center has been working nonstop. Its staff hold talks, make phone calls to authorities, help fill out forms, organize language courses, look for apartments and arrange cooking classes and meetings over coffee and cake. They encourage, advise, comfort and, when necessary, also look after children.\n\nA city like Herzogenrath normally received about 50 to 60 new refugees per year, estimated the pastor. \"Now, 400 war refugees from Ukraine arrived in the space of three months — and we currently have 530,\" he said. In addition, about 850 people who fled from 20 other countries have also arrived. \"Some have found jobs in the meantime, many have not — and the need for integration does not stop there.\" The municipality cannot cope with this on its own.\n\nIn Aachen, 20 kilometers (12 miles) away, the situation looks no better. At the start of August, Mayor Sibylle Keupen pulled the emergency brake and announced that the city would not accept any more war refugees or asylum-seekers for the time being. All emergency accommodation centers were full, including eight gym halls.\n\nAachen Mayor Sibylle Keupen has said many refugees are here to stay, and need permanent accommodation\n\nMost of the more than 4,000 Ukrainian refugees who are registered in Aachen and receive financial support have found accommodation privately. This is also because Aachen already had a relatively large Ukrainian community before the war.\n\nIt is mostly people from African countries, along with a few Syrians and a handful of Ukrainians, who live in a \"container village\" made of prefabricated buildings that were set up on a former sports ground in the city's south in 2016. The small rooms, each with their own cooking facilities, showers and toilets, are in hot demand because they offer privacy. Up to 120 people can live there, but a third of the containers are currently leaking and therefore uninhabitable. Attempts are underway to repair them.\n\nThe city authorities in Aachen are working flat out to convert vacant commercial properties into accommodation. The plan is that the refugees should have moved out of the gyms in a few months, by the end of autumn.\n\nA Dutch company sets up makeshift accommodation to house refugees\n\nLocal authorities feel abandoned\n\n\"We are now in a situation where we realize this war will probably go on for a long time yet — the people will stay here, and they need something other than a sports hall,\" said Keupen. \"These are families, these are different ethnic groups, different age groups, who all clash together there — that is also an explosive social force that we must moderate. That is very difficult if we do not have more small-scale accommodation options.\"\n\nThe mayor supports the demand from the German Association of Towns and Municipalities, which represent the interests of city and district authorities, for a refugee summit. The federal government must better control the distribution of people across the country, as well as step in financially, she believes.\n\nUkrainian children go to school in Germany\n\n\"We need an orderly system to really provide people with — and this is the important thing for me — not just a roof over their head and a bed, but more. They need a place at school, or day care: they also need psychosocial care, especially when it comes to families and children who are dealing with war-related trauma,\" she said.\n\nThese are all things that throughout Germany are just as hard to come by as an available apartment — for which the refugees are competing with the rest of the population.\n\n\"Most landlords say no straight away, or hang up when they hear about refugees,\" said Michaela Lee, who is responsible for administration at the refugee help center in Herzogenrath.\n\n\"I am always so glad when I manage to find an apartment for a refugee,\" she added. \"Or an apprenticeship, after I have helped write hundreds of applications.\" That is her motivation.\n\nThis article was originally written in German\n\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

    "The politics of Germany’s Zeitenwende": "Germany’s Zeitenwende still has a long way to go Karl-Peter Schwarz\n\nAn economic downturn could threaten support for reducing a trifecta of dependencies: energy imports from Russia, exports to China and the United States for security.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Angela Merkel arrive for a press conference on August 20, 2021, in Moscow. In 2021, the last of Ms. Merkel’s 16 years as chancellor, Germany imported 55 percent of its natural gas from Russia. In the wake of Russia’s war in Ukraine and the Kremlin’s use of energy as a political weapon, Berlin wants to drastically reduce this dependency. © Getty Images\n\n× In a nutshell Germany faces difficulties undoing the mistakes of the Merkel-Schroeder eras\n\nDefense spending, despite increases, remains short of NATO’s 2 percent goal\n\nHigher energy prices may weaken the public’s willingness to support Ukraine\n\nChancellor Olaf Scholz’s speech in the Bundestag on February 27, 2022, was a watershed event in German history.\n\nMr. Scholz spoke of a “turning point” – Zeitenwende in German – triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “The world after that is no longer the same as the world before,” the German leader said. The statement gave the impression that Germany had suddenly become aware of its responsibilities. From now on, the nation of 83 million people, with Europe’s largest economy, would no longer entrust its security to the United States alone, its energy supply to Russia and its economic growth to exports to China.\n\nThis turnaround is primarily about German-Russian relations, the need to strengthen defense capability and deterrence, and secure energy supplies. Mr. Scholz announced he would provide the Bundeswehr with a credit-financed special fund of 100 billion euros. That is a significant amount, but to meet the expectation that NATO members invest at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product (GDP) in defense, an additional 25 billion euros would have to be spent annually, adjusted for inflation.\n\nMajor overhaul needed\n\nThe change required is enormous. In 1989, Germany invested 2.7 percent of its gross domestic product in national security, and by 2014, it was only 1.1 percent. Only since 2017 has the share risen again – in 2021, it was 1.5 percent. However, 41 percent of this was spent on personnel and pension entitlements. In France, 26.5 percent of defense funds go to equipment; in Germany, only 16.87 percent do. On the day of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Bundeswehr Inspector Lieutenant General Alfons Mais, the highest-ranking officer of the German Army, said that the army had been severely weakened after years of austerity and is no more up to the task.\n\nUnder Mr. Scholz’s predecessors, Gerhard Schroeder (1998-2005) and Angela Merkel (2005-2021), German foreign and security policy assumed that the nation was surrounded only by friends. This misjudgment led to a security policy recklessness that manifested itself in the neglect of the Bundeswehr. When the U.S., the United Kingdom, Poland and other NATO partners supplied Ukraine with heavy weapons, the Bundeswehr was already in such a deplorable state that it could not comply with the Ukrainian government’s requests.\n\nHowever, national security is only one of the many ruins Ms. Merkel has left to the Scholz government. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s threat to cut off gas supplies would not be nearly as effective if Germany had not done everything it could to make itself economically blackmailable. Udo Di Fabio, a former judge with the Constitutional Court, delivered a devastating verdict on German energy policy:\n\nNo country with a keen sense of the mechanics of foreign power relations would have actively promoted or passively accepted such a massive energy dependence on Russia as Germany under chancellors Schroeder and Merkel. Criticism from the U.S. of projects such as Nord Stream 2 was politely forbidden, criticism from the Baltic states was not taken seriously. The Federal Republic pursued an almost romantic energy policy.\n\n× Facts & figures Germany’s 3 major vulnerabilities In trade, defense and energy, Germany has been highly reliant on three nations – China, the United States and Russia, respectively. But the government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz has promised to overhaul Germany’s natural security strategy to reduce dependencies in each area. (Sources: International Energy Agency, Federal Statistical Office of Germany, Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.) © GIS\n\nSelf-inflicted wounds\n\nReduced Russian oil and gas supplies are hitting Germany particularly hard today because rising global demand is accompanied by a politically engineered shortage that began long before the sanctions against Russia. Germany has been suffering from the consequences of self-inflicted economic wounds that have dominated energy policy since Ms. Merkel embraced the positions of the Greens.\n\nIn 2011, she used the destruction of four reactor units in Fukushima, caused by an earthquake and a tidal wave, as a pretext to order Germany’s withdrawal from the peaceful use of nuclear energy. The nuclear and coal-fired power plants were gradually shut down, and domestic gas extraction by fracking was dispensed with, citing possible environmental damage.\n\nAnother concession with which the chancellor drew the left-wing opposition to her side was the opening of borders during the migration crisis of 2015-2016. Compared to the Greens, the party Die Linke and the left wing of the Social Democrats, she thus distinguished herself as an ally in the “fight against the right.” The informal party coalition on which the chancellor relied ranged from the left-wing fringe to the Greens to deep into the CDU, which lost its conservative and Christian-democratic brand core.\n\nRevising wrong decisions that have accumulated over five legislative periods would overwhelm any government, even if the parties supporting it had not been involved in setting those misguided policies.\n\nToday, German parties have to say goodbye to a series of apparent certainties that have been questioned for more than 20 years only on the fringes of the party spectrum branded as populist. To revise wrong decisions that have accumulated over five legislative periods would overwhelm any government, even if the parties supporting it had not been involved in setting those misguided policies.\n\nThe three parties in the Scholz government had helped shape Germany during these two decades. The Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the Greens governed under Mr. Schroeder of the SPD from 1998 to 2005. Twice, from 2005 to 2009 and 2013 to 2021, the SPD belonged to a grand coalition with the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) under Ms. Merkel. The Free Democratic Party (FDP) had been Ms. Merkel’s junior partner in the black-yellow coalition from 2009 to 2013. All three parties of the “traffic light” coalition and the CDU, as the largest opposition party, played a part in the drama that turned the economically strong and politically self-confident Germany of Helmut Kohl (who served from 1982-1998) into a less reliable and crisis-prone partner for the Western world.\n\nThe conditions supporting the German export industry have deteriorated significantly following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war.\n\nRectifying misguided policies\n\nThe responsibility for the mistakes and omissions of the Merkel era lies first and foremost with the CDU. Friedrich Merz, who emerged from the turmoil as Ms. Merkel’s successor as the new CDU chairman, had been the chancellor’s most prominent opponent within the party for years. So, it was not too difficult for him to support the turnaround that Mr. Scholz announced in the Bundestag. To prevent conflicts in the party, however, he has so far avoided criticizing the former chancellor, who had shaped the profile of the CDU and still enjoys significant support in it. To stand openly against them would be understood as a concession by the new CDU chairman to the Alternative for Germany (AfD), the only party in the Bundestag to have opposed them on almost all issues.\n\nMs. Merkel’s popularity was evident in a poll conducted three weeks before the federal election in September 2021. In it, 80 percent of those surveyed approved of her job. That judgment reflects the economic upswing experienced by Germany during her chancellorship.\n\nRobust German growth had been the result of an exceptionally favorable combination of several factors, led by cheap energy from Russia. But other factors contributed to the boom times: an upswing in the global economy, particularly from rising demand in China, the wage restraint of German workers and the weak external value of the euro. The higher tax revenues financed the expansion of the welfare state, the energy transition and a climate policy that was executed without regard for the industry’s concerns.\n\nMeanwhile, the conditions supporting the German export industry have deteriorated significantly following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war. The International Monetary Fund revised downward its growth forecasts for 2022 and 2023. In May 2022, it estimated Germany’s 2022 growth at around 2 percent; by July, the projection was only 1.2 percent. Numerous small and medium-sized enterprises, especially in the tourism and gastronomy sectors, have had to close due to the Covid lockdowns. It is feared that many companies will not survive the increased energy prices and the reduction of gas supplies in autumn and winter.\n\nTo relieve consumers, the government has thus far made 30 billion euros available. On September 4, the German chancellor announced an additional 65 billion-euro relief package, with Mr. Scholz finally acknowledging the obvious: “Russia is no longer a reliable supplier of energy.” It represents a sharp departure from the failed strategy of “change through trade.”\n\nThe situation has kept changing dramatically. On September 5, the German government even agreed to continue operating until April 2023 two of the remaining three nuclear power plants that had been scheduled to close at the end of the year. Also on that day, the Kremlin said it is stopping gas supplies to Europe through Nord Stream until Western sanctions are lifted against Russia.\n\nSee also\n\nWill support for sanctions hold?\n\nNevertheless, the party Die Linke and the AfD are planning a “hot autumn” for the government. There were violent protests when Chancellor Scholz wanted to explain the federal government’s plans at a citizens’ meeting in Neuruppin on August 18. Unlike Ms. Merkel, who largely eluded debate, Mr. Scholz strives to establish contact with the citizens. However, he lacks charisma, and he keeps as many options open as possible in his statements. The chancellor is wary of the tense relations in the coalition with the Greens and the FDP and tries not to provoke the left in his own party, whose influence has increased after the Bundestag election.\n\nMeanwhile, the approval ratings of the traffic light coalition are falling. In a survey at the beginning of August 2022, only 14 percent of respondents said they were “very satisfied” with the government’s work, while 37 percent said they were “very dissatisfied.” Satisfaction with the chancellor has also slumped. Recent polls also show his SPD party losing popularity as the Greens gain.\n\nOpposition to supporting Ukraine is particularly strong in the SPD. Not only Mr. Schroeder but Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and numerous other Social Democrats are known for their pro-Russian stance, which was not questioned in the party until after the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. If the energy crisis in winter leads to mass social protests, the pressure on the government to lift or at least mitigate the sanctions against Russia is likely to increase, as demanded by Die Linke and the AfD.\n\nIn the CDU, too, more voices want to force a change of course. The spokesman of this current movement is Saxon Prime Minister Michael Kretschmer, who is pushing for quick negotiations to “freeze” the war because sufficient Russian gas flows in the coming years are essential to keep social peace in Germany. There has been a debate even in the FDP since Wolfgang Kubicki, vice president of the Bundestag, proposed activating the Nord Stream 2 pipeline as soon as possible. The FDP chairman Christian Lindner and numerous other politicians of the party have spoken out vehemently against it.\n\nOnly the Greens have thus far resisted the temptation to question the turnaround in Russia policy announced by Mr. Scholz in the Bundestag. Among the German parties, only they had spoken out against Nord Stream 2 from the outset. In the German Bundestag, the Greens campaigned even more than the CDU and FDP to support Ukraine against Russia with the supply of heavy weapons.",
    "Putin is mobilizing. Germany and France are unlikely to step up": "John R. Deni is a research professor at the U.S. Army War College’s Strategic Studies Institute and a non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. He’s the author of “Coalition of the unWilling and unAble.”\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin’s recent decision to partially mobilize Russian reservists represents a significant escalation in his war against Ukraine.\n\nOver the coming weeks and months, this could inject as many as 300,000 additional Russian troops into the Kremlin’s war effort — and just as Ukraine has achieved some battlefield success. Increased Western assistance is now vital for Kyiv to leverage and expand its gains and build up defensive positions, before additional Russian forces enter the fight. But not all Western powers have been pulling their weight in this regard — especially Paris and Berlin.\n\nThe Franco-German engine has powered the European Union for over 70 years. Today, however, that engine has stalled in the face of the greatest challenge confronting European security since the end of World War II. The Continent’s most powerful economy and its most powerful military are failing to meet the moment. And, unfortunately, odds that either will change course within the timeframe necessary to help Kyiv achieve its objectives are low.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, top political leaders in both France and Germany appeared to recognize the scale of the crisis. French President Emmanuel Macron immediately highlighted the damage Russia had done to European peace and stability, noting that in its response, the West would “be without weakness” in the military, economic, and energy domains. Meanwhile, new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz declared Putin had destroyed the European security architecture, arguing that the Russian invasion had marked a turning point, and it was now time to support Ukraine to “the best of our ability.”\n\nSince those early days, though, the actions of Europe’s political dynamic duo have failed to match their own rhetoric. Germany has been dragging its feet on sending the kinds of military equipment other allies have been providing Ukraine for months. After promising to deliver multiple launch rocket systems, self-propelled howitzers and air defense systems, the glacial pace of delivery has cast doubt on Berlin’s commitment. Moreover, Germany’s sheer unwillingness to send heavy armored forces — like tanks and infantry fighting vehicles — has prompted criticism from Ukrainian leaders, who accuse Berlin of backtracking.\n\nMeanwhile, France has been willfully curtailing its assistance in hopes of playing the role of neutral arbiter when the shooting stops. Macron irreparably damaged his claim to European leadership when he called on Ukraine to avoid humiliating Putin, and from an operational perspective, while the country has provided offensive weapons to Ukraine, it has reportedly sent less than even Germany, and trained an extraordinarily small number of Ukrainian troops compared to others like the United Kingdom.\n\nClearly, these leading European countries have both failed to rise to the occasion — but for two very different reasons.\n\nFor over a half century, Germany has pursued a cooperative change-through-trade approach to Russia. Now, having finally woken up to Moscow’s zero-sum approach — and its corresponding disdain for cooperation with the West — Berlin is attempting to reverse its long-standing strategy. But change is never easy, especially in Germany, so the effort to overcome entrenched, conventional national security wisdom goes two steps forward, one step back.\n\nFor France, however, the dynamic in question isn’t change but the opposite — status quo.\n\nResidual illusions of French grandeur lie at the heart of Macron’s efforts to walk an elusive middle ground between the West and Russia. Across much of the Continent, France’s leading role in pursing European “strategic autonomy” in recent years has been seen as a thinly veiled attempt to resuscitate French greatness and promote the country’s own interests. However, in trying to position France as a practically minded, neutral arbiter between Ukraine and Russia, Macron has instead undermined Paris’s reputation as a defender of Western values and interests.\n\nUnfortunately, as this French pursuit of greatness continues to endure and 50 years of German foreign policy won’t be changed overnight, neither of these European powers is likely to play a leading role in helping Ukraine in the short run. This is particularly problematic at the moment, as Kyiv is eager to keep up the momentum after the serious battlefield success realized by its forces.\n\nAlthough the news from the Kharkiv region of northeastern Ukraine has been remarkably positive for Kyiv in recent days, there are still many reasons to think Russia is far from being knocked out of the conflict.\n\nFor one thing, Ukraine’s progress in the south — where it had begun shifting resources from Kharkiv — remains slow and arduous. Additionally, Moscow retains the ability to conduct precision long-range strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure. Most importantly, though, Russia still holds both qualitative and quantitative military advantages over Ukraine in terms of both manpower and equipment.\n\nFor all these reasons — especially given Putin’s partial mobilization — the war will most likely continue to unfold over the coming months, if not years. Ukraine is unlikely to remain in the fight without significant long-term Western aid, precision weaponry in particular, which they have already been using to good effect, targeting Russian supply lines and logistics. But they will need more — particularly if outmatched in troop numbers later this year.\n\nThe United States, the U.K., Poland, and other allies are all currently providing substantial training, equipment, expertise and intelligence. And in response to Putin’s mobilization, both France and Germany have an opportunity to do so as well — but whether and when they will fulfill their potential remains to be seen.",
    "How will Germany line up at the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022?": "Germany go in search of equalling five-time world champions Brazil as record FIFA World Cup winners when they land in Qatar this winter, but who will be taking the field when their campaign gets underway and how will Hansi Flick be setting out his stall?\n\nFollowing a two-year spell at Bayern Munich in which Flick collected two Bundesliga titles, DFB Cup, UEFA Super Cup, FIFA Club World Cup and UEFA Champions League trophies, the 57-year-old took his country's reins in August last year.\n\nTypically, of a coach who led Bayern to an unprecedented sextuple, Flick took to international duty in fine fashion.\n\nPredecessor Joachim Löw finished his tenure with two losses, a defeat and just one win as Germany exited the UEFA Euro 2020 championships at the last-16 stage to old foes England.\n\nOne of Flick's first decisions was to immediately reinstate Thomas Müller to his side and the fresh face of a new coach saw the team hoover up eight successive victories. Now with 14 games under their belt, the former shopkeeper's side still boast an impressive run of results (W9, D4, L1) and they again look a force to be reckoned with.\n\nWatch: Tireless Thomas Müller\n\nIt shouldn't come as a surprise when you consider that Flick served as Löw's assistant when Germany claimed a fourth world title in 2014.\n\nSince taking the big job, the national team have scored in 13 of those 14 matches and hit four or more goals on six occasions, including a 9-0 demolition of Liechtenstein as Germany made light work of qualification for Qatar.\n\nOption 1\n\nAs was the case during his spell in the Bayern hotseat, Flick has settled on a 4-3-2-1 formation for all but one of his games in charge, instead opting for a 3-4-2-1 in the 1-1 draw with England in June.\n\nInterestingly, versatile defender Thilo Kehrer has started most frequently under Flick, with the former Schalke man beginning on the right and left of Germany's defence four times apiece and at centre-half in his three other starts.\n\nHe's clearly a player trusted by his coach and his versatility will be a major asset in tournament football, but Kehrer is most likely to start from the bench when Germany are at full strength.\n\n- /\n\nWant more Bundesliga Action?

On the opposite flank, Leipzig left-back David Raum is in pole position ahead of Robin Gosens and Christian Günter.\n\nIn front of them, Kimmich has been partnered in equal amounts by Leon Goretzka and Ilkay Gündogan, and it appears a straight shootout between the latter two as to who lines up alongside Bayern's No. 6.\n\nFlick's tenure so far has suggested that Müller and Sane are fairly certain of starting berths, but there is such fierce competition for places that the attacking spots remain up in the air.\n\nFormer Bayer Leverkusen starlet Kai Havertz hasn't yet nailed down a spot of his own but his ability to play anywhere in attack, coupled with the fact he is naturally left-footed, could help his cause.\n\nWatch: The best of Manuel Neuer\n\nSerge Gnabry scored four times in Flick's first four matches but has started just two of Germany's last nine.\n\nConsidering Gnabry's previous success under Flick for club and country, as well as his record of a goal approximately every 125 minutes in international football, and his more natural ability to operate from the flanks, you would imagine he and Sane would line-up either side of Müller in an all-Bayern supporting cast.\n\nIf fellow Bayern attacker Jamal Musiala continues his fine early season form, however, he could well get the nod from Flick, although Gnabry’s greater experience is likely to be valued highly at the World Cup, with Musiala set for a role as an impact substitute.\n\nGnabry has also operated through the middle for his country, but it looks far more likely that Werner and Havertz will vie for the opportunity to lead the line. On current evidence, Werner's movement off the ball and lighting pace look the better fit.\n\nWatch: Timo Werner - RB Leipzig take II\n\nOption 2\n\nGermany's strength in depth is remarkable, with world-class options in reserve at every station on the pitch.\n\nBarcelona custodian Marc-Andre ter Stegen has filled in for Neuer when the captain hasn't been present, and the long-standing back-up will surely be next in the pecking order in Qatar, his shot-stopping qualities and ability with the ball at his feet making him a reliable alternative.\n\nWith Hofmann having elbowed his way into the starting XI at right-back, West Ham’s Kehrer is next in line on the right of defence. The sheer number of times he has been picked by Flick indicating a place on the plane is virtually assured.\n\nFlick named Süle as a guaranteed starter against England in the Nations League at the end of September in Rüdiger’s absence, indicating that he will be among the first XI at the World Cup. If the 57-year-old’s tenure at Bayern is anything to go by, he likes to keep a settled team and avoid too much rotation in terms of personnel and formation, so a Rüdiger-Süle axis looks to be Germany’s centre-back duo in November.\n\n- /\n\nConsequently, Schlotterbeck is first in line as a replacement, alongside Freiburg’s Matthias Ginter, whom Flick recently praised for being “in very good shape”. At left-back, Gosens looks slightly ahead of Günter for the first reserve berth, although that could all change over the coming weeks with Gosens’ playing time limited at Inter, while Günter continues to shine for Freiburg in the Bundesliga and Europa League.\n\nGoretzka has struggled with injury in the early part of 2022/23 but is a high-calibre alternative for central midfield, with Wolfsburg’s Maximilian Arnold a reliable option – and a left-footer to boot, although he is slightly more defensive-minded.\n\nOnce again it is in the attacking third that Flick is really spoiled for choice. He singled out Musiala for praise ahead of the Nations League tie with England, hailing the 19-year-old’s development over the last couple of years.\n\n“From the first time he trained with the first team at Bayern you could see how talented he was,” the tactician said. “His progress has been great and he is brilliant in tight spaces. He’s got a good feeling for space and is a really good dribbler. He’s very good defensively and wins a lot of balls for us. I’m happy he plays for Germany.”\n\nWatch: All of Musiala's Bundesliga goals so far in 2022/23\n\nMusiala has usually been the first attacking substitute under Flick, although Kai Havertz and Marco Reus will likely have something to say about that in Qatar. The latter, in particular, will be raring to go as he is currently on the sidelines for a few weeks with an injury sustained against Schalke on Matchday 7. And we all remember how he missed the 2014 triumph due to an injury right before heading to Brazil.\n\nLukas Nmecha offers a different threat to Werner up front. Whereas the Leipzig forward is a blur of pace and movement, his Wolfsburg counterpart brings greater physicality at 6’1” and is equally lethal with either foot: last season he scored three with his left, three with his right and two headers for the Wolves.\n\nOption 3\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Flick has only employed a 3-4-2-1 formation once in his 14 games at the helm, but he is a pragmatist unafraid to change if necessary.\n\nIn this variation, Schlotterbeck’s composure in possession and ability to play accurate, raking diagonal balls from the back would fast-track him into the starting XI. Hofmann and Raum would be given license to explore the final third of the pitch, albeit with the brief to stay wide and drag deep-lying opposition defenders out of position in the absence of a more traditional winger like Sane or Gnabry.\n\nGündogan would play higher up than Kimmich to overload the centre alongside Müller and Musiala, who probe on the edge of the area looking for gaps to exploit Werner’s speed.\n\n- /\n\nOption 4\n\nAll of which leaves us with a purely hypothetical fourth option. Injuries to any of the above would open the door to a number of squad regulars, who could form an imposing side in their own right.\n\nKevin Trapp’s star rose in the wake of Eintracht Frankfurt’s Europa League triumph in May, Lukas Klostermann and Jonathan Tah have plenty of experience at the highest level for Leipzig and Leverkusen respectively, while former Bochum defender Armel Bella-Kotchap has impressed since his summer move to Southampton and recently received his first senior call-up.\n\nFurther forward in central midfield, Florian Neuhaus and Anton Stach are experienced Bundesliga pros, if slightly green at international level, while the likes of Julian Brandt, Julian Draxler and Karim Adeyemi would normally be the first names on the teamsheet in almost any other national side.\n\n- /\n\nFor Flick the only remaining question would be who to take as a third striker? Niclas Füllkrug has been consistently good for Werder Bremen over the past 18 months and is currently the leading German scorer in the Bundesliga. His aerial threat should not be overlooked, particularly if the side are chasing the game late on.\n\nIt is perhaps a coin toss between him and Dortmund teenager Youssoufa Moukoko. While still raw, he has pace to burn and former BVB teammate Erling Haaland once even claimed he was better than him at the same age. He would be familiar with the Dortmund contingent already in the squad but a handy wildcard to have nonetheless: attacking players with the ability to produce a moment of magic from nothing are highly prized commodities.",

    "Germany takes baby from gay foster parents after Türkiye intervenes": "A Turkish-German family hailed Germany's decision to scrap the decision for adoption of their baby by gay parents after Türkiye intervened in the case following the family's opposition.\n\nIn May, the 10-month-old boy was handed over to Jugendamt, the German child welfare office, on the grounds that the mother, allegedly suffering from psychological problems was unfit for parenting and the infant was underdeveloped. Despite parents’ protest, the office did not retract the decision and the case was widely covered in Turkish media. The family, who lives in Duisburg, has said their child was given to a gay couple living near Cologne. They claimed that it was not an isolated case and that many other Turkish families had the same problem. A.K., the mother, has claimed she was allowed to see her son only once a month and called upon Turkish authorities to help her.\n\nA.K. said after the decision that Jugendamt apparently “felt the pressure” after media coverage of her case. “(Türkiye’s) Family and Social Policy attache’s office in Düsseldorf found us a lawyer and Minister of Family and Social Policy Derya Yanık personally took interest in the case,” she said, expressing her gratitude. A.K. stated that she also received many messages of support on social media. “We hope Jugendamt does not make another mistake and places my son at least with a Turkish family so he would not be deprived of the opportunity to learn Turkish culture and language,” she said.\n\nTurkish Ministry of Family and Social Policy had suggested two Turkish volunteer foster parents for E. earlier. The ministry has said in a recent statement that they hoped their request would be considered. The ministry also said that they attached importance that host countries considered lifestyle choices based on cultural and moral norms in such cases while assessing the foster care process for Turkish children.\n\nThe ministry, whose work was largely confined to Türkiye, had expanded its activities abroad in recent years. It seeks to promote the adoption of Turkish children in expat communities abroad by Turkish foster parents. Minister Derya Yanık has recently announced that some 200 Turkish children have been returned to their biological parents since 2015 in Germany thanks to the work of their attache offices in the European countries. First lady Emine Erdoğan also spearheads efforts to promote the foster parenting process among Turkish families abroad. Her campaign has seen 599 families volunteering to be foster parents in European countries.\n\nIn force since 1924, the Jugendamt was established to protect children but has become notorious for targeting the children of immigrant families. It gets paid by the German state according to the number of children it takes care of, and some foster parents manipulate childcare issues for their own economic interests. Such factors undermine the operation of the institution, which was originally founded with goodwill. Immigrant families in the country are scared to take their children to the hospital or psychologists because sharing their problems may mean they will inform the Jugendamt, which takes the custody of the children from their families. For instance, the child of a Turkish family with the surname of Toprak was forcibly taken when they took him to a hospital after he had chips stuck in his throat, while other families’ children were taken away because they allegedly spoiled their children and showed excessive attention. Germany currently hosts the largest number of Turkish immigrants, mostly descendants of \"guest workers.\"",

    "Germany Considers Price Caps As Energy Crisis Worsens": "Germany looks to cap the prices of electricity and natural gas to help households and businesses reel from the soaring energy prices, The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, quoting German government officials.\n\nAccording to the Journal's sources, the plan for price caps in Europe’s biggest economy could become official in the coming weeks if the EU doesn’t agree on a price cap for the entire bloc.\n\nElsewhere in Europe, in the UK, for example, there is a price cap on energy bills that energy providers can charge to customers. The new UK has just announced that it would cap the annual energy bills for households at $2,700 (£2,500) for two years.\n\nUnlike the UK cap on prices, and a similar measure introduced in France, the cap in Germany would rather impose a levy on electricity-generating firms that charge more than a certain amount, yet to be determined, the Journal’s sources say. The money collected from the levy on producers would be later distributed to the operators providing energy to the end users, which would allow for lower power prices for end users.\n\nMany energy-intensive industries and companies in Germany are already feeling the pinch from the soaring natural gas and electricity prices. Some have curtailed production or stopped entire production lines, many others plan to do so.\n\nSigns are mounting that the German economy is slipping into recession, which will deepen as we head into the winter months amid the ongoing natural gas and energy crisis, Bundesbank, the central bank of Germany, said in its monthly report last week.\n\nAlso last week, the German government, energy giant Uniper, and Uniper’s majority shareholder, Finland-based firm Fortum, signed a deal under which Germany would nationalize its largest gas importer, in a move aimed at preventing a collapse of the German energy and gas suppliers.\n\nBy Michael Kern for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",
    "Germany lags far behind on gender equality in agriculture, study finds": "Germany is lagging far behind its EU counterparts when it comes to the share of farms being managed or passed on to women according to a new study, which points to the far-reaching consequences this has on their financial security.\n\nRead the original German story here.\n\nOnly 11% of farms in Germany are managed by women, according to a recent nationwide study conducted by the Thünen Institute and the University of Göttingen on behalf of the German agriculture ministry.\n\nOn top of that, only one in five of the people set to inherit or otherwise take over farms are women, the study added.\n\n“The results show that women in rural areas are performing tasks of systemic importance, but are at the same time often not very visible in terms of financial matters,” explained Agriculture Minister Cem Özdemir at an event where the results of the study were presented on 22 September.\n\nSpecifically, the study points to an imbalance between women’s far-reaching responsibilities on farms and how this is reflected legally.\n\n83% of the women farmers surveyed said they work on their family’s farm, while almost three-quarters said they are also involved in strategic and entrepreneurial decisions. But only in very few cases is this contribution also reflected legally, as evidenced by the low proportion of female farm managers.\n\n“In contrast to many other countries, de facto joint farm management is not recorded statistically in Germany,” according to the report.\n\nFinancial insecurity\n\nThe consequences on the financial security of women farmers are far-reaching.\n\nThe report’s authors point out that divorce, separation or the death of their partners could plunge female farmers into financial insecurity, stressing that this has ramifications for women’s healthcare and old-age provision.\n\nIn case of divorce or death, for example, “the risk of female old-age poverty is significantly higher and still too few are covered by contracts or wills,” President of the German Rural Women’s Association Petra Bentkämper stressed in a statement.\n\n“These risks must be talked about openly,” she added.\n\nThe study’s authors are thus urging women on farms to start taking care of social security coverage, together with their partners, at an early stage.\n\nAt the same time, the report calls on insurance providers to “examine the risk of possible pension gaps for women with different employment histories” and to draw their attention to solutions for this.\n\nIn France, for example, the government passed a pension reform at the start of February that is set to benefit women farmers.\n\nGerman women still face 'greater hurdles' in EU farm fund access German women tend to benefit less than men from the support programmes of the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), Juliane Vees, the first vice-president of the German Association of Women in Agriculture, told EURACTIV Germany in an interview.\n\nTackling gender inequality\n\nTo tackle the root cause of gender inequality in the agricultural sector, the study’s authors stress it is necessary to address underlying barriers to entry such as outdated gender images and traditional inheritance practices.\n\n“In order for more women to take over and manage farms, a fundamental change in agricultural traditions is necessary, coupled with more educational work at agricultural educational institutions,” explained Janna Luisa Pieper from the University of Göttingen at the study’s presentation.\n\nIt is important that the educational work is not only directed at women, said Pieper: “Gender-equitable agriculture concerns everyone.”\n\nIn addition to counselling, education and mentoring services, the experts also believe that support programmes must be created or adapted to make it easier for women to start their own agricultural businesses even without inheriting a family farm.\n\nBut while Germany does support young farmers in setting up their own businesses, it is not doing enough for female entrepreneurs in the agriculture sector, according to the European Commission.\n\nIn its observation letter on Germany’s National Strategic Plan for the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform, the EU executive said the country needed to pay more attention to issues such as the “income gap between the sexes” or “the gender gap among farm managers, especially young farmers.”\n\nMore detailed data needed\n\nHowever, data on the income gap in Germany’s agriculture sector is very scarce.\n\nThe report presented last week, for example, is the first nationwide study on the situation of women in agriculture for which associations, like the LandFrauenverband, had long campaigned for.\n\nThe authors are thus calling for collecting more detailed data on the topic to identify better and address women’s obstacles in the field.\n\n“Even if we have been aware of many things for a long time, we need figures and evidence to be able to initiate changes politically,” said LandFrauenverband’s Bentkämper.\n\nWomen farmers 'essential' for future, says French agriculture minister An increasing number of women in France are entering the agricultural world, dominated by men for so long. EURACTIV France takes a closer look at the role of women farmers in the country.\n\n[Edited by Natasha Foote/Nathalie Weatherald]",
    "Germany loses another glacier as warm temps melt Alpine ice": "Germany lost one of its few remaining glaciers this summer as exceedingly warm weather ate away Alpine ice at a faster pace than feared, a scientific report released on Monday showed.\n\nThe Bavarian Academy of Sciences said the state's Southern Schneeferner had lost its official status as a glacier due to rapid melting of its once sprawling ice sheet.\n\n\"The Schneeferner's ice thickness shrank significantly in large swathes and in most places no longer measures even 2 meters (6.5 feet),\" the academy said in its latest findings.\n\nIt said even the thickest spot was now diminished to less than 6 meters compared to around 10 meters in 2018. The surface area of the glacier halved during the same period to about one hectare.\n\n\"That leads us to conclude that the remaining ice will completely melt away in the next one to two years,\" the academy said.\n\nIt said that the dramatic shrinkage meant that the periodic measurements carried out by the academy since 1892 would now be suspended.\n\nThe loss means Germany has only four remaining glaciers: Northern Schneeferner and Hoellentalferner on its highest mountain, the Zugspitze, and Blaueis and Watzmann in the Berchtesgaden Alps.\n\nRapid glacier melt in the Alps and elsewhere, which experts say is being driven by climate change, has been increasingly closely monitored since the early 2000s.\n\nBavaria's Environment Ministry said last year in a bombshell report that Germany could lose its last glaciers within the decade as climate change gathered pace.\n\nScientists had previously estimated the glaciers would be around until the middle of the century.\n\nA global study released in April 2021 found nearly all the world's glaciers are losing mass at an ever-increasing pace, contributing to more than a fifth of global sea level rise this century.",

He also referred to WWII reparations Poland is expecting from Germany.\n\n“Of course, Germany operates under the veil of the European Union. Remember, we are not arguing with the EU, we are its loyal members, we argue with Germany.

He underlined that it is a dispute over the German role in Europe, which is also taking place within Poland. He explained, there is currently a Polish party in Poland, represented by PiS, and a German party, which Mr Kaczyński said is made up of the Civic Platform and Donald Tusk.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fight for war reparations will be global\n\nsource: pap\n\nMr Kaczyński also referred to the question of reparations for losses during World War II. He recalled that so far 70 countries have received various types of compensation for crimes and losses inflicted by Germany, but Poland is not among them.“We cannot accept that we are worse. Saying that we are not owed is a part of that belief,” he said. He noted that the votes for renouncing reparations by the communist government in 1953 should be rejected.“There was no legally binding action in that matter,” he stressed. He added that this is evidenced by the calculation of Warsaw losses made by the former President of Warsaw Lech Kaczyński almost twenty years ago.“The fight for reparations will last a long time, but we will conduct it with all consistency on a global scale. The world must know what it was like,” Jarosław Kaczyński stated.",
    "How German travelers spent the summer of 2022": "The island of Usedom in northern Germany was not quite as popular this summer as it was the two previous years. Nevertheless, those working on the Baltic Sea island were not altogether displeased by the number of bookings this season. The number of reservations was only about 20% below those of the previous two years, says Michael Raffelt, founder of the Hotel Hanse-Kogge in the municipality of Koserow and chairman of the Usedom Island Hotel Association. \"It hasn't been a bad summer either,\" he says. Due to the pandemic, the previous two summer seasons saw an unusually large number of Germans spending their vacations on the Baltic Sea instead of traveling abroad. \"Now we have to get used to fighting for every guest again,\" says Raffelt.\n\nThe number of tourists on Usedom approached pre-pandemic levels in 2022\n\nTraveling outside Germany again\n\nTraditionally, about two thirds of Germans spend their vacations outside of Germany. Yet the pandemic changed this, as COVID-19 health and safety measures made international trips more difficult. This summer, however, many German holidaymakers eagerly headed abroad. Package trips to destinations in the Mediterranean were especially popular, according to the German Travel Association. The island of Mallorca, Spain, along with Greece and Turkey were in particularly high demand. Bookings even surpassed those of 2019, before the pandemic.\n\nThe Spanish island of Mallorca was one of the most sought-after destinations for German tourists this summer\n\nTour operator Dertour observed a similar trends. After two years without vacations abroad, many German travelers seemed willing to spend a bit more than in pre-pandemic years. According to Dertour's recently published figures, spending on hotels outside of Germany rose by some 51%. Many travelers booked high-end hotels and stayed one day longer, on average, according to the operator.\n\nThe situation in Germany is somewhat different. On Usedom, for example, Michael Raffelt has noticed a great deal of uncertainty among his guests this summer. Many bookings were made short-term, often only 14 days in advance. He feels it is partly due to rising prices in Europe. Guests want to wait to see how they develop and only then \"decide if they go on vacation at all.\" And once they decide to take a trip, they are spending less than usual. \"Many guests no longer go to the restaurant every day,\" he says.\n\nUsedom – A Summer Holiday Favorite\n\nHotels in crisis mode\n\nSales figures in the German hospitality industry remain below pre-pandemic levels, according to the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (DEHOGA). The situation is \"extremely challenging\" because the industry is simultaneously \"confronted with exponential costs in the areas of energy, food and personnel,\" says DEHOGA head Guido Zöllick.\n\nAdditionally, more than 60% of hospitality businesses were still looking for staff at the start of the season in June. \"Because there is a shortage of staff, companies are reducing their opening hours and scrapping events,\" says Zöllick. Yet despite the challenges, business picked up once COVID-related regulations were dropped in May.\n\nStaff shortages remain one of the major problems in the hospitality industry\n\nThis positive trend is also confirmed by the Ministry of Tourism of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. The region in Germany's northeast had a successful summer tourism season. The utilization of all tourist capacities was 87% in July and 80% in August. Schleswig-Holstein, in turn, reported a 4.4% increase in overnight stays in the first half of the year compared to the same period in 2019. The North Sea Tourism Association, meanwhile, expects summer numbers to be about the same as before the pandemic. However, guests have recently become \"more price-sensitive\" and have shown more restraint when it comes to paying for leisure activities and gastronomy, says the organization.\n\nLow water levels and camping success\n\nDaniel Thiriet of IG RiverCruise, an industry group, also saw numerous challenges to his sector this summer. A prolonged drought led to low water levels in many places and made river cruising more difficult. Although there were only a few cancellations and complete route closures, companies had to go to great lengths to maintain operations. On Germany's Rhine river, for example, ships could no longer operate in some places, so passengers had to be transported by bus in certain sections.\n\nLow water levels made it difficult for boat cruises on the Rhine to take place this summer\n\nOne of Germany's travel sectors that grew during the pandemic is camping. In the first half of the year, Germany's campsites set a new record. According to the Federal Association of the Camping Economy in Germany (BVCD), the number of overnight stays rose by 11% to 14.2 million, compared to the same period in 2019. Yet, the joy may be short-lived. \"In view of the uncertain forecasts and current burdens on consumers, we are looking ahead to the fall with subdued expectations,\" says BVCD head Christian Günther.\n\nGermany's most beautiful campsites Beach fun a stone's throw away Welcome to the Baltic Sea, a popular vacation destination during the pandemic. Summer, sun, sand and sea ― what more could you want? Well, ideally, a place to stay near the coast. Campingpark Kühlungsborn is located on a 12-hectare nature reserve by the sea. Here you'll find sunny and tree-shaded sites, some only 50 meters from the beach. It's also not far from the seaside resort of Kühlungsborn.\n\nGermany's most beautiful campsites Camping surrounded by the sea Wulfener Hals is also located close to the sea, on the island of Fehmarn, between Burger Binnensee and the Baltic Sea ― a paradise for surfers and water sports enthusiasts. You will find here campsites, vacation apartments, hotel rooms and restaurants. Fehmarn is Germany's third-largest island, with sandy beaches and steep slopes, small villages and around 2,000 hours of sunshine a year.\n\nGermany's most beautiful campsites Camping in the Mecklenburg Lake District Let's continue south ― to the Mecklenburg Lake District, Germany's largest contiguous lake area. Here you'll find the Havelberge camping park. The area is far from the hustle and bustle of the big city at the Woblitzsee lake, with a beach and large lawn to sunbathe. Canoes, kayaks, motorboats and dragon boats can be rented. And for those who come with their own boat: there's mooring in the harbor.\n\nGermany's most beautiful campsites A campsite among impressive rock formations The LuxOase (luxury oasis) lives up to its name: The five-star campsite offers a range of activities, playgrounds and sports fields, a climbing castle and a wellness area with sauna, steam bath, infrared cabin and more.

He is especially worried about the projected high energy costs — some hotels on Usedom have already had their energy contracts terminated by suppliers. It remains to be seen what new conditions — and energy prices — will be. Raffelt does not expect anything positive. \"After all, we are not an industry that can pass on all costs to customers,\" he says. Otherwise, this would be directly reflected in booking figures.\n\nThis article was translated from German.",
    "Germany and France put energy diplomacy at the top of their agendas": "European governments are entering the final stretch of the race against the clock as they compete against Putin for a winter of reliable energy security. This last quarter of 2022 is witnessing a strong prioritisation of energy diplomacy by EU executives, as evidenced by the upcoming visits of the Macron government's Prime Minister Elizabeth Borne to Algeria and this weekend's visit to the Middle East by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\n\nFrom Berlin, the Social Democrat chancellor once again promised to control electricity and gas prices this winter. The nightmare of Scholz's government since he took office has been Germany's energy supply, which has been deeply dependent on Russia for decades. Since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, the German leader's poll ratings have plummeted, not least because of the links of several members of his team to the Russian government - links that the German government has worked to deny by firmly supporting Ukraine in the conflict, supplying major arms packages, including Gepard anti-aircraft systems among other weapons systems.\n\nPutins Krieg stellt auch uns vor viele Herausforderungen: Hungersnöte verhindern, Energieversorgung sichern, die hohen Energiepreise abfedern und für #Entlastungen bei den Bürgerinnen, Bürgern und Unternehmen sorgen. All diese Aufgaben lösen wir gemeinsam. #KanzlerKompakt. pic.twitter.com/FFMMDhYDGB — Bundeskanzler Olaf Scholz (@Bundeskanzler) September 24, 2022\n\n\"We want to ensure that electricity prices are brought down again by changing the market model. And we want to see to it that gas prices come down,\" Scholz said in a video published in the chancellery's media on Saturday. The German government has been juggling for months between sanctions against Russia and the search for new ways of obtaining gas supplies. Already earlier this summer, the Scholz government's energy minister, the Green Robert Habeck, travelled to Qatar to meet with his counterparts and reach agreements to increase the supply of non-liquefied gas to Germany. The Middle East solution seems more promising for now than the Medcat pipeline, which remains blocked by France despite the intention of Spain, Portugal and the European Commission to implement it.\n\nScholz has a busy weekend ahead of him with plans to visit the Arab Gulf states. According to information from Birgit Jennen for Bloomberg, citing sources in Scholz's cabinet, the German chancellor is all set to finalise the signing of several LNG and hydrogen supply deals during his tour.\n\nThe visit will take him to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, accompanied by a \"high-level\" business delegation, of which the German government has not provided many more details. According to the same Chancellery sources, Germany has been trying for months to reach a long-term agreement to open up supply channels with Saudi Arabia.\n\nPHOTO/Presidencia de Rusia - Russian President Vladimir Putin receives German Chancellor Olaf Scholz at the Kremlin amid the crisis in Ukraine, 15 February 2022\n\nIt was also revealed that negotiations with the United Arab Emirates are very close to concluding another hydrogen supply agreement to reduce dependence on Russia in the long term. If these prognoses come true, Scholz would keep his word and the Social Democratic leader could regain some of those points lost in the public eye behind closed doors.\n\nElizabeth Borne back in Algiers\n\nFrom Paris, the Matignon hotel, the headquarters of Macron's prime minister, it was reported that Elizabeth Borne will travel with a large delegation to Algiers on 9 and 10 October. This is the fifth meeting between the French and Algerian governments since Macron's state visit in August.\n\nThis time, the Prime Minister will discuss the gas dossier, which is why she will travel in the company of senior officials from ENGIE, the public gas company, and will meet with delegates from Sonatrach, as well as the Prime Minister of Tebboune, Aïmane Benabderrahmane. The French government announced last week that significant progress would soon be made in negotiations to increase gas supplies to France from Algeria.\n\nPHOTO/GOUVERNEMENT FRANÇAIS - EHitherto Prime Minister Jean Castex passes the baton to the new head of government Élisabeth Borne during the ceremony at the Matignon Palace\n\nAccording to French channel Europe 1, Borne's visit to Algiers could lead to a 50 per cent increase in Algerian gas exports to France. According to French public data, the French energy mix is 20% dependent on gas. In this distribution, Algerian gas represents between 8% and 9% of the total, figures that could change if Europe 1's information is true.\n\nIf these new agreements are approved, France advocates transporting gas by sea, the same method that experts close to the Elysée recommend using instead of investing in the Mecat pipeline.",

    "Is Germany's economy too dependent on China?": "The Port of Hamburg, Germany's biggest seaport, is considered the country's gateway to the world. But above all, it is a gateway to China, which is the port's largest customer. In the first half of 2022 alone, more than 1.3 million containers from China arrived here.\n\nNow, Chinese shipping giant COSCO wants to take a 35% stake in the harbor, and its operators would like that, too. They say this would make the container terminal a prime transshipment hub in Europe for the world's largest shipping company. But the Economy Ministry in Berlin has reservations and may not approve COSCO's investment in the Hamburg Port. The dispute over COSCO's involvement illustrates how rethinking ties with China impacts the German economy.\n\nGermany's dependence on Russian gas has proved to be a weak point following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This realization has led the government to revisit the country's relationship with China as well. Some 5,000 German companies operate in China today.\n\nHow to deal with an autocracy that has been Germany's largest trading partner for years? How to deal with the country that EU documents refer to as a \"partner,” a \"competitor” and \"strategic rival” — with the balance shifting toward the latter?\n\nHabeck: 'The naivety towards China is over'\n\n‘End of naivety'\n\nGerman Economy Minister and Vice-Chancellor, Robert Habeck from the Green Party, has already announced a \"more robust trade policy\" toward China. \"The time of naivety toward China is over,\" Habeck declared in mid-September after a meeting of G7 economy ministers.\n\nBack in May, Habeck denied the VW Group guarantees for investments in China. That came as a shock: For decades, German companies' business in China had been backed by guarantees on both investments and exports.\n\n\"In the near future, if German companies want to invest, if they trade with China, they are likely to do so at their own risk and will no longer be able to rely on government guarantees and safeguards,\" says China expert Tim Rühlig of the German Council on Foreign Relations (DGAP). He sees a change of course: the German government \"no longer wants to provide incentives for German companies to expand business in China,\" Rühling tells DW in an interview.\n\nBut that does not stop them from doing so anyway. According to a study by Jürgen Matthes, an economist with the German Economic Institute (IW), the German industry invested around €10 billion in China in the first half of this year alone — a record figure.\n\nCar manufacturers and chemical companies in particular are continuing to seek a foothold in the Chinese market. According to a study published by the Rhodium Group in mid-September, the four German industrial giants — carmakers VW, BMW, Mercedes and chemical company BASF — alone account for a third of European direct investment in China.\n\nVolkswagen is one of the major German investors in China\n\nOr is the dependence overestimated?\n\n80% of European investments are made by just 10 large European companies, according to Jörg Wuttke, president of the European Chamber of Commerce in China. \"The others are not leaving China, but are currently interested in other countries for new investments and are also thinking about diversification,\" Wuttke observes.\n\nEurope's top ten companies, however, are heavily reliant on China, he warns, pointing to dependence on China for imports of rare-earth elements, preliminary products for the pharmaceutical industry, and for photovoltaic systems. But dependence on China is fundamentally different from reliance on Russian energy, he says: \"We have a pipeline with oil and gas from Russia. But from China, we have a 'pipeline' with toys, furniture, sports equipment, clothing, shoes. Most of those products — I would say 90% of them — are easily replicable elsewhere.\"\n\nAround 3% of German jobs depend on exports to China, economist Matthes points out. \"That's over 1 million jobs. That is a considerable number, but over 45 million people are employed in Germany today,\" he says, and concludes: \"On a macroeconomic level, the dependence on China as an export market is relevant, but it's not as huge as media reports often make it out to be.\"\n\nImportant for the energy transition: Solar cells from China\n\nPressure from the Green Party\n\nNevertheless, within Germany's new center-left coalition government of Social Democrats (SPD), neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP) and environmentalist Greens, the latter in particular are putting pressure on companies to rethink their ties with China.\n\nAt the beginning of September, Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told business leaders: \"We can't afford to just hope that things won't be so bad after all with these autocratic regimes.\" The Green Party politician, who stands for \"a values-based and feminist foreign policy,\" announced the development of a new China strategy as part of a new National Security Strategy. \"It is important to the German government and to me personally that we transfer what we have learned from our dependence on Russia to our new China strategy,\" she says.\n\nThe Economy Ministry is considering ways to encourage companies to turn to other Asian countries, instead of China. Government investment and export guarantees are being reappraised. The government-owned KfW Bank is to examine whether it could scale back its China program and instead offer more loans for business in countries including Indonesia.\n\nLast year, the Federation of German Industries (BDI) was already debating rules for foreign trade policy cooperation with autocracies. It suggested a \"concept of responsible coexistence in foreign economic policy and clear boundaries for any cooperation.\"\n\nFor many managers, however, the change of course in the Economy Ministry goes too far.\n\n\"Government support and protection of German companies' business in China must remain, in principle,\" Friedolin Strack, chief executive of the Asia-Pacific Committee of German Business (APA), told the news agency Reuters.\n\nChinese investments should be welcome in Germany and Europe, he insisted. Whether this should also apply to the specific case of COSCO's entry into the Hamburg Port, however, Strack did not want to say.\n\nThis article was originally written in German.\n\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

    "Denouncing Russia’s war in Ukraine, German Chancellor calls for upholding rules-based global order": "“There is no justification whatsoever for Russia’s war of occupation against Ukraine,” Mr. Scholz said as he addressed the Assembly’s annual high-level debate.\n\n‘Imperialism, plain and simple’\n\n“President Putin is waging this war with one single objective: to seize Ukraine. Self-determination, political independence do not count for him. And there’s only one word for this – this is imperialism, plain and simple. The return of imperialism is not only a disaster for Europe, but also a disaster for our global peaceful order.\n\n“If we want this war to end, then we cannot be indifferent to how it ends. Putin will only give up his war and his imperialist ambitions if he realizes that he cannot win,” he continued.\n\n“This is why we will not accept a peace dictated by Russia. This is why we will not accept any pretentious referenda. And this is why Ukraine must be able to defend itself against Russia’s invasion.”\n\nMr. Scholz said the world is witnessing new fragmentation, the emergence of new wars and conflicts, and the rise of major global crises.\n\n“Some have seen this as a harbinger of a world without rules,” he noted. “Our problem isn’t the absence of rules. Our problem is the lack of willingness to abide by them and to enforce them.”\n\nThe alternative to a rules-based world is not anarchy, but the dominion of the strong over the weak, he stated, stressing that the international community cannot be indifferent to “whether the rule of power or the power of rules wins the day.”\n\n“The international order does not happen by itself. If we do nothing, then this Charter is but a piece of paper, he said, holding up a copy of the founding document of the United Nations. “This Charter calls on all of us to uphold its purposes and principles.”\n\n‘We stand for international order’\n\nThe world “must not stand idly by when a major nuclear power, armed to the teeth, a founding member of the United Nations and a permanent member of the UN Security Council no less, seeks to shift borders through the use of violence,” Mr. Scholz stated.\n\nThe Chancellor added that the war in Ukraine is leading to rising prices, energy scarcity and famine. Germany is supporting Ukraine with the export of food and will also support efforts to rebuild the country. In this regard, on 25 October in Berlin, an international conference of experts will look at how to manage the “herculean” task of rebuilding.\n\n“Our message is this: we stand firmly at the side of those under attack; for the protection of the lives and the freedom of the Ukrainians; and for the protection of our international order.”",

    "Germany must shake off its habit of finding excuses for inaction": "A German decision to send Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine would send a powerful signal to the Kremlin, Constanze Stelzenmüller writes. This article originally appeared in the Financial Times .\n\nLife: it’s unfair. German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht gave a long-prepared speech in Berlin on Monday, in which she laid out her thinking on strategy. She asserted confidently that Germany was destined by “our size, our geographical location, our economic power, in short our heft” to be a “leading power in Europe, whether we like it or not.”\n\nThe strategic adversaries uppermost in Lambrecht’s mind are, however, at home. She is striving to assert her authority at a time when the Foreign Ministry is writing Germany’s first ever national security strategy. It does not help that leaders of her Social Democratic Party (SPD)’s parliamentary group are vocal skeptics of what some pointedly refer to as “chic bellicism,” or a fashionable taste for war.\n\nLambrecht’s task is to remind them forcefully that the Zeitenwende, or turning point, promised by SPD Chancellor Olaf Scholz in a landmark speech after Russia’s attack on Ukraine needs to be sustained and funded. Especially for the armed forces.\n\nUnfortunately, her audience — including Germany’s allies — was interested in a different question: how Berlin’s destiny to lead relates to Ukraine’s urgent requests for more heavy weapons. Contrary to the fears of many — and the hopes of some — across the west, Kyiv’s armed forces have achieved an astonishing rout of the invaders, regaining more territory in a week than Russia captured in five months.\n\nCaution remains warranted. But for the first time, a Russian defeat appears possible if Ukraine can press its advantage across the long frontline. As Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told his German counterpart Annalena Baerbock, this is impossible without armored infantry carriers and battle tanks.\n\nLambrecht, echoing Scholz, parried that no other ally had delivered Western-built infantry fighting vehicles or main battle tanks; that this would deprive NATO allies of German protection; and that Germany would never “go it alone.” Also, such weapons deliveries would represent an “escalation” — meaning Russian President Vladimir Putin could then consider Germany a direct participant in the conflict. This is the brightest of red lines for Scholz’s three-party ruling coalition.\n\nCue yet another fierce Berlin brouhaha over heavy weapons deliveries. Ricarda Lang, co-chair of Scholz’s Greens coalition partner, tweeted that “the time for hesitancy is over.” Parliamentary defense committee chair Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann of the Free Democrats, the third coalition partner and herself something of a lethal weapon, demanded immediate deliveries of German Marder infantry carriers and Leopard 2 tanks.\n\nMore unusually, the U.S. Embassy in Berlin waded in with a three-part tweet thread: the U.S. appreciates German contributions; allies should support Ukraine “as much as possible”; each country is free to decide on the manner of its support (this last part blew up a smokescreen deployed for months by the German government).\n\nTranslated from diplo-speak: love you, Berlin, but please, please grow a pair and stop pretending we’re telling you what to do.\n\nIn truth, the government’s position is untenable. Other allies have sent armored infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine. Some have sent tanks, mostly modernized Soviet-era versions. The 24 Gepard armorred air defense systems and 10 Panzerhaubitze 2,000 howitzers Berlin has sent to Ukraine, plus much other kit, have, by Kyiv’s admission, made a real difference in its counteroffensive. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg is asking allies to prioritize deliveries to Ukraine. As for red lines, the Russian ambassador opines they were crossed a while ago.\n\nThe only serious concern about Leopard 2 tanks is that they are sophisticated machines which would require three or four months of training. But the Ukrainians are fast learners and Russia still occupies a fifth of their territory. Deciding to send the tanks now would send a powerful signal to the Kremlin that Germany won’t be intimidated.\n\nDuring the Cold War, leaders of a partly sovereign West Germany intoned a trinity of compelling reasons (Zwang) why they absolutely could not do something: rules, allies, and facts (Normzwang, Bündniszwang, and Sachzwang). Usually, it meant they absolutely didn’t want to.\n\nMore than 30 years later, after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the regaining of full sovereignty, it’s a disingenuous habit Germany needs to shake off. It’s certainly unworthy of a country that aspires to leadership in Europe.",
    "Germany signals willingness to take in Russians fleeing Ukraine war conscription": "Several German government ministers have indicated that under specific conditions, Germany is ready to take in Russians fleeing the \"partial military mobilization\" ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"Deserters threatened with serious repression can, as a rule, obtain international protection in Germany,\" Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said in an interview with the daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.\n\n\"Anyone who courageously opposes Putin's regime and thereby falls into great danger, can file for asylum on grounds of political persecution,\" she said.\n\nGerman Justice Minister Marco Buschmann tweeted using the hashtag \"partial mobilization\" that \"apparently, many Russians are leaving their homeland — anyone who hates Putin's path and loves liberal democracy is welcome in Germany.\"\n\nMeanwhile, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock praised Russian anti-war protesters and added that no one inside the country can continue turning a blind eye to what's happening in Ukraine because \"every Russian is now going to be at risk of being drafted into this war.\"\n\nGerman Bundestag parliamentarian Robin Wagener of the Greens told DW that it has always been a \"cause of the West to open borders to those fleeing from regimes,\" like those seen in the former Soviet Union.\n\n\"When I hear [Ukrainian] President Zelenskyy saying saying directly to Russian young men, 'protest against the regime, fight it or flee.' Then there needs to be a place to flee to,\" he said.\n\nWagener added that under European law, persons fleeing from military service, when this military service is also linked to war crimes, have the right to asylum.\n\n\"We should keep to that and have our arms open for those fleeing,\" he said.\n\nRussia cracks down on protests against mobilization\n\nRussia denies exodus of young men\n\nOn Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov downplayed reports of draft-age men from Russia fleeing en masse after Putin's announcement.\n\n\"The information about the hype at airports and so on is very much exaggerated. ... There is a lot of fake information about this. We need to be very careful about this so as not to become a victim of false information on this matter,\" he said.\n\nSince Putin declared a \"partial mobilization\" of reservists, flights for the coming days from Russia to visa-free countries including Armenia, Turkey, Azerbaijan and Serbia have sold out entirely. Lengthy lines were reported at Russia's borders with Georgia, Finland, Kazakhstan and Mongolia.\n\nProAsyl calls for admission of deserters\n\nThe German-based human rights organization Pro Asyl also called for countries to grant asylum to deserters and conscientious objectors from Russia and Belarus.\n\n\"According to EU law, those who escape a war that violates international law have a right to asylum and protection. In this sense, Germany and Europe must now unbureaucratically organize the admission of the people who vote with their feet against the Russian war of aggression,\" the head of the European department of Pro Asyl, Karl Kopp, told the Rheinische Post newspaper.\n\nSince February 24, Germany has taken in around 1 million Ukrainians fleeing Russia's invasion, but also welcomed Russian dissidents. According to Faeser, 438 Russian dissidents, including journalists, have also benefited from an accelerated process to obtain protection in Germany.\n\nHowever, she pointed out that political asylum is not automatically granted; applicants are first subjected to security checks.\n\nThe European Commission also said people fleeing partial mobilization in Russia have the right to claim asylum in the European Union. \"This is an unprecedented situation,\" Anita Hipper, an EU spokesperson responsible for migration said.\n\nAccording to Hipper, the applications would need to be considered on a case-by-case basis. She added that work was ongoing with EU member states to find a joint approach.\n\nOn Wednesday, officials from the EU's Baltic member states said they will not offer refuge to any Russians fleeing Moscow's partial mobilization.\n\nEarlier this week, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania closed their borders to most Russian citizens in response to the wide domestic support in Russia for the war in Ukraine.\n\ndh/wmr (AFP, dpa)\n\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

    "Germany promises Moldova help with energy crisis": "Germany on Friday pledged help for EU candidate Moldova as the country struggles to deal with the consequences of the war in neighboring Ukraine — particularly rising fuel costs.\n\nThe promise came days after thousands of protesters gathered in the Moldovan capital, Chisinau, to demand the resignation of pro-Western President Maia Sandu. Opponents of Sandu blame her government's policies for high inflation and fuel prices.\n\nHelp to bridge energy gap\n\nChancellor Olaf Scholz met Sandu in Berlin to discuss support for Moldova, which has been particularly hard-hit by the economic effects of the invasion.\n\nCoinciding with the visit, Germany's Development Ministry said it would support Moldova with an additional €60 million ($58.9 million) in funds to overcome the energy crisis.\n\nDevelopment Minister Svenja Schulze praised the steps already taken by Moldova's government to make the necessary reforms to become an EU member.\n\n\"It is remarkable how quickly and purposefully the Moldovan government has already tackled judicial and administrative reforms in its first year. Now it is urgently a matter of getting people through the winter safely and thus stabilizing this heavily burdened country,\" she wrote on Twitter.\n\nMoldova's course of reforms as part of the EU accession process and further support in coping with the consequences of Russia's war in Ukraine were on the agenda for Sandu's visit.\n\nThe gas price in Moldova has risen twelvefold in the last 12 months.\n\nMoldova has slashed its growth estimate to zero for 2022. The economy has been damaged by record-high inflation at 34.3% and interest rates rising to 21.5%.\n\nEU grants Ukraine, Moldova candidate status\n\nThe country faced deep economic woes even ahead of the Russian invasion, with more than a quarter of the population living in poverty. It now hosts tens of thousands of Ukrainian refugees.\n\nEast-West fault lines\n\nSandwiched between Romania and Ukraine, Moldova is one of Europe's poorest countries and, like Ukraine, has been politically divided between pro-Russian and pro-Western factions.\n\nRussian troops have been stationed in the breakaway region of Transnistria since the end of a separatist war in 1992.\n\nIn the early months of Russia's war in Ukraine there were fears of a spillover of the war into Moldova, should Moscow attempt to forge a land corridor to the region through southern Ukraine.\n\nUkraine war sparks worries in Moldova\n\nAlthough Transnistria effectively seceded from Moldova in 1992, Moscow has not officially recognized the region's independence.\n\nWith just 2.6 million people, Moldova was the smallest of the countries known as \"captive nations\" comprising the former republics of the old Soviet Union.\n\nExploring Eastern Europe: Moldova The capital city of Chisinau Located between Romania and Ukraine, the small country of 2.6 million sees relatively few tourists, yet has plenty to explore. Chisinau is the country's capital and cultural center, home to a wide variety of museums and eateries. Although dominated by Eastern-bloc architecture, its neoclassical gems include the Triumphal Arc built in 1840. Don't miss a stroll in leafy Stefan cel Mare Central Park.\n\nExploring Eastern Europe: Moldova Nativity Cathedral Moldova has some spectacular churches and one of the most spectacular is the neoclassical Nativity Cathedral in Chisinau. Built in the 1830s, it has a turbulent past: It was destroyed during WW2 and not allowed to operate as a church while Moldova was part of the Soviet Union. In recent years it was fully restored, and can now be visited by tourists who come to admire its ornate beauty.\n\nExploring Eastern Europe: Moldova Orheiul Vechi (Old Orhei) Located about an hour's drive from the capital, the nature and archaeological reserve of Old Orhei is popular with tourists for its many sites and impressive limestone cliffs. The Geto-Dacians Fortress is the oldest ruin, dating back to the 7th century BC; there is also the Butuceni cave monastery carved into stone. Orhei is also a popular spot for hiking, climbing and even paragliding.\n\nExploring Eastern Europe: Moldova Relaxing in nature in Saharna Located near the village of Saharna just 100 kilometers (62 miles) north of the capital is a series of rivers and caves popular with tourists. The most stunning waterfall is known as Gypsy Hole, although all of the waterfalls located on the Saharna River are impressive. The area is an ideal place to find peace and quiet and enjoy nature.\n\nExploring Eastern Europe: Moldova Tipova Monastery Moldova has a number of unique Orthodox monasteries carved into rock, and Tipova is arguably the best-known. Towering some 200 meters (656 feet) over the Nistru river, the monastery is the largest cave monastery not only in Moldova, but in all of Eastern Europe. The views from inside the monastery of the river and surrounding landscape are fabulous.\n\nExploring Eastern Europe: Moldova Kayaking on the Nistru river Moldova's Nistru river, also called the Dinester, runs along the border of Ukraine. A great way to explore it is by kayak: Several tour operators offer day-long kayak trips which start or stop at villages along the river. There, one also has the chance to sample the cuisine of Moldova, including local dishes like Sarmale, dumplings made of cabbage leaves and filled with rice, vegetables and meat.\n\nExploring Eastern Europe: Moldova World's largest wine cellar Moldova has 128,000 hectares of vineyards and in recent years, wine tours have become one of the most popular sightseeing activities in Moldova — after all, grape-growing began to flourish back in the 15th century. Milestii Mici claims to be the largest wine cellar in the world. Located in a former underground limestone quarry, it has a large network of tunnels in which its wine supply is kept.\n\nExploring Eastern Europe: Moldova Soroca Fortress With a scenic position on the Nistru river, the medieval Soroca fortress was once part of a large defense system which included fortresses on the Danube river. Built by order of Moldova's hero Stephen the Great in the 15th century, it's the only medieval monument in the country that was preserved as it was originally designed. Pay a visit to the small but ornate military church on the premises.\n\nExploring Eastern Europe: Moldova Birdwatching on Beleu Lake Around Moldova networks of bird watching routes have been created in floodplains, forests, waters and farmlands. In the Orheiul Vechi Culture-Nature Reserve, for example, tourists can see more than 100 bird species that nest in the area. Another picturesque place to take one's binoculars is on a boat ride on Beleu Lake in the country's south which is a stopover point for many migrating birds.\n\nExploring Eastern Europe: Moldova Ukranian refugee children in Moldova Despite being one of the smallest and poorest countries in Europe, neither a NATO member nor a member of the European Union, Moldova has taken in the highest number of Ukrainian refugees per capita. Tens of thousands of refugee children are currently living in Moldova, many at refugee camps in the country's capital. Providing them with educational opportunities is a major challenge.

    "Five ways a groundbreaking €9 rail pass changed Germany": "While most Germans likely thought they were just living their lives, every weekend getaway, every metro journey to work, every bus ride to the store, and every train trip to a lake to beat this summer’s unprecedented heat was one small part of a gigantic experiment: Germany’s €9 train ticket.\n\nDesigned to offer relief against rising inflation and encourage sustainable travel, it allowed unlimited use of local and regional transport throughout the country.\n\nThe June-August programme, which did not include high-speed rail lines, proved incredibly popular. Over three months, 52 million tickets were sold, according to Germany’s association of public transit companies (VDV).\n\nSo, given its scope, how did the experiment change Germany?\n\n1. Public transport was accessible to everyone\n\nRail travel in Germany has become quite expensive, often prohibitively so. Deutsche Bahn (DB), Germany’s national rail provider, offers regional rail day passes at the state-wide level starting at €22. These are only good if you stay within one state, while national day passes start at €42.\n\nFor those not planning a single day packed with travel, individual regional rail trips are typically more expensive than the passes. Germany’s high-speed \"ICE\" trains cost even more.\n\nThese prices make rail travel unobtainable for many.\n\nYet for a few months, public transport was opened up to a population much more representative of the whole public.\n\n“With the €9 ticket, for many families going on a weekend getaway suddenly became a real possibility. Simply hopping on the train on a Saturday and taking a ride,” Moritz Ehl told Euronews.\n\nEhl is a coordinator at Mobility for All, an organisation in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate that pushes for more accessible transport.\n\n“Families, retirees, and people living in poverty all suddenly had new opportunities for their leisure time, along with the ability to fully participate in society,” said Ehl.\n\nThe programme didn’t just make a rare holiday possible for many struggling with poverty, it eased the financial pressure of everyday life.\n\nGermany’s Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs uses a countrywide cost of living estimate to determine monthly allowances for the roughly seven million Germans receiving social assistance, which includes unemployment, welfare, and retirement benefits.\n\nAs of 2022, the estimate only allows for €39.01 a month for all transportation expenses. The average cost of a monthly local rail pass in German cities is €80.60.\n\n“That means you can maybe take a couple of single rides, but every time you need to really think about whether you can afford the ride. Whether it’s to the doctor, to go shopping, or even to work… All of that is unrealistic for just [€39],” said Ehl.\n\nGiven that even local public transit is out of reach for so many in Germany, it’s no wonder then that Berlin’s local transport authority reported a 14% increase in ticket sales from May 2022.\n\nGermany's €9 rail pass shown alongside fuel prices. Credit: Reuters\n\n2. Some Germans gave up their cars\n\nThe €9 ticket initiative was introduced as part of a larger inflation-relief programme, but it also clearly had climate-related goals as well.\n\nBoosting public transport usage and encouraging drivers to leave their cars at home and hop on trains -- not an easy task in car-loving Germany -- was a key goal.\n\n“Looking at some of the studies that are already out there, it’s not just people that already use public transport [that bought the tickets], there are new users as well,\" said Dr Eva Heinen, a transport researcher at the Technical University of Dortmund, told Euronews. \"Overall, you also see a reduction of car use during the programme,”\n\nAccording to VDV, 10% of the €9 ticket trips replaced vehicle use. They estimate this prevented roughly 1.8 million tonnes of CO2 from entering the atmosphere.\n\nDr Heinen, who is working on a study of the programme’s impact, expects further, independent studies to come in within the next few months.\n\nWhile Dr Heinen argues that rural communities, often poorly-served by public transport, did not benefit as greatly from the programme as urban regions, its broader disruptive nature cannot be discounted.\n\n“You can't underestimate the effect of breaking habits or building new habits,\" she said. \"People will not just suddenly wake up and think ‘you know what, I think I’m going to change’. You need to trigger this sometimes.”\n\nWhile it’s clear there will be a follow-up to the €9 ticket, it was not immediately introduced at either the national or regional level. Dr Heinen expressed concern that this delay might be just long enough to break some newly-developed green transport habits.\n\nA train passes a railroad crossing surrounded by floodwaters from rain and melting snow in Nidderau near Frankfurt, Germany, Wednesday, Feb. 3, 2021 Credit: AP\n\n3. Public transport is back on the climate agenda\n\nWhether it’s about massive government subsidies for purchasing or producing electric vehicles, or the unending battle surrounding introducing a speed limit to Germany’s famed autobahn highway system, much of the debate around reducing transport emissions in Germany is centred on cars.\n\nDr Heinen told Euronews that she’d welcome a shift in focus away from technical innovations in cars towards a push to change larger transport habits.\n\n“I hope it has changed the discourse. Because there’s been a lot of focus on technical improvements. If you want to encourage public transport, subsidising [ticket cost] is definitely one way to go, the other is improving service, which is better in some areas than others,” she said.\n\nNow that the €9 ticket’s extreme popularity has captured the public imagination, and debate about its extension has been ever-present in recent political discourse, mass transport and its role in reducing emissions are at the fore.\n\nStill, Dr Heinen points out that in order to reach its climate goals, Germany might have to do more than simply make public transport more appealing.\n\n“There’s also a lot of offering more choice and hoping that will result in people making the best decision,\" she told Euronews.\n\n\"That alone doesn’t reduce CO2 emissions.\n\n\"I think if you really want to reduce emissions, unfortunately, you need some measures that push people away from the car.”\n\nA train passes flowers near the rails in Frankfurt, Germany, early Wednesday, June 23, 2021 Credit: AP\n\n4. Germany can skip bureaucracy when it wants to\n\nBureaucracy is deeply entrenched in German society and while Kafkaesque quests to find the right stamp for paperwork can be a borderline-comic inconvenience, thick ribbons of red tape can have serious implications on policy implementation.\n\nEhl has experienced this first-hand at the policy level. When Mobility for All lobbied for a state-wide ticket affordable to recipients of social assistance in Rhineland-Palatinate, even supportive politicians and transport policymakers claimed having one ticket for all five transit authorities in the state was simply unrealistic.\n\n“Then, boom, you get the €9 ticket, which hadn’t even been on the political agenda before,\" he told Euronews.\n\n\"But it proved that you could have a Germany-wide ticket with just a couple of months of preparation. And it showed what’s possible when the political will is there,” he told Euronews.\n\nFor three glorious months, the same, easy-to-order ticket worked everywhere in the country. The time spent staring at transport maps, wondering if you would cross an inner-state border and need an additional ticket, was simply obliterated. It wasn’t just that the ticket was extremely affordable, or that you could take it anywhere. It was also incredibly simple to use.\n\n“I think convenience is an element that hasn’t been discussed as much. It’s not just down to price. If we think about the major aspects that shape why people adopt certain modes of travel, time, effort, and costs are major aspects,” said Dr Heinen.\n\nWhile the national government mulls a successor initiative, some local governments are introducing their own reduced ticket schemes. Berlin, which is launching a city-wide €29 monthly ticket from October to December to act as a bridge until a national ticket is offered again, will help reduce the financial weight of local travel. But the second that riders leave the ticket’s jurisdiction, they will once again be faced with the headache of sorting another ticket for the same ride.\n\n5. The state can help if the political will is there\n\nLike much of Europe, Germany is facing a cost-of-living crisis, with heating and gas prices spiking just as the country prepares for winter. While German politics in recent decades has often been marked by belt-tightening, highlighted by the introduction of a constitutionally-mandated balanced budget in 2009, the €2.5 billion transport ticket initiative shows Germany is capable of big spending to ease economic pain.\n\nAccording to a study by the German Economic Institute, a private research institute in Cologne, inflation in Germany would have been 2% higher without the €9 ticket. With a successful model for staving off inflation, Germans know the state can provide help when there is adequate political will.\n\nRising costs are likely to affect public transport providers as well, only exacerbating the situation.\n\n“A big risk for public transport are rising energy costs. You don’t want to know how big energy bills are for these public transport providers. So there’s the question of who will pay for that,” Dr Heinen said to Euronews.\n\nDer Spiegel has reported Munich’s local transport authority is planning to raise ticket prices by 6.9%, while Deutsche Bahn is contending with €2 billion in rising energy costs and is likely to announce price hikes starting next year.\n\nThose prices may get shunted onto the German state instead of passed down to transit riders. The German government has announced it is planning to bring back a reduced-price, national rail ticket, albeit at a significantly higher price – somewhere between €49 and €69.\n\n“For anyone who already has a rail pass and pays €90 or €100 a month, even a €69 ticket would bring a lot of savings,” said Ehl.\n\n“We see anything that encourages public transport use as positive,” he continued. “But we don’t see it as fair if every household, regardless of income, pays the same for a ticket. There are a lot of people who can’t afford a €49 ticket.”\n\nPaying around €60 for a monthly ticket might not feel like a bargain when many have gotten used to the €9 price point. Germans now know that what was once an inconceivably cheap ticket is a real possibility. And with expenses only expected to keep climbing this winter, they also know that the state can help fight inflation when it wants to.\n\nLessons learned?\n\nWith Spain adopting a free transport programme to close out the year and plenty of other European countries weighing similar initiatives on both the national and local level, it seems other countries have learned from Germany’s €9 ticket experience.\n\nWhile the lessons from the ambitious experiment are clear, it’s not as obvious just how many of them Germany will heed. That’s what will determine whether millions in Germany took part in a grand, once-in-a-lifetime experiment this summer, or if they helped shape the future of German transport.",
    "Pressure mounts on Germany’s Scholz to send tanks to Ukraine": "The warning shots are getting closer and louder.\n\nIn a heated parliamentary session on Thursday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz received stark signals from his coalition partners that they expect him to ramp up weapons supplies to Ukraine at what is becoming an increasingly critical inflection point of the war.\n\nWhile his government coalition bought him a little more time in the Bundestag debate and temporarily fended off a critical parliamentary motion expressing a lack of faith in his military support for Ukraine, it is now looking more and more likely Scholz will have to respond to the calls for Europe’s biggest economy to pull its weight when it comes to arming Kyiv more decisively.\n\nWitheringly, opposition lawmaker Florian Hahn from the center-right Christian Social Union fumed that Germany was only “number 18 in the world” when comparing its military aid for Ukraine relative to the economic output. Hahn noted that Estonia was far ahead of Germany in supplying arms instead of keeping them for national defense, “even though they have a direct border with the Russian Federation.”\n\nThe center-right Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU) opposition block had requested a vote on a Bundestag motion that urges the government to “immediately” allow the export of German battle tanks and infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine. That would have been tantamount to a vote of no-confidence in Scholz’s Ukraine strategy, since the chancellor has repeatedly ruled out such deliveries as long as other Western allies don’t deliver similar heavy gear.\n\nThe opposition’s maneuver was particularly dangerous for Scholz and his Social Democratic Party (SPD) because leading politicians from his coalition partners, the Greens and the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP), have also demanded the delivery of German Leopard battle tanks and Marder infantry fighting vehicles.\n\nTiming is now of the essence. Ukraine is appealing for more weapons as it launches bold counter-offensives against the Russian invaders in the east and south of the country, while Russian President Vladimir Putin is vowing to throw hundreds of thousands of new soldiers into the conflict and is holding fake referendums in occupied territories to incorporate them into Russia.\n\nA vote on weapons deliveries in the Bundestag would have risked revealing fatal cracks in the government unity and could even have led to a defeat of Scholz in parliament.\n\nFollowing a heated 50-minute debate, however, the majority of SPD, Greens and FDP lawmakers voted to send the opposition’s motion to the foreign affairs and economic affairs committees for further discussion. That effectively delays a plenary vote on the text for a few weeks.\n\nStill, the government now also faces the risk of renewed pressure next week as the opposition “could request a plenary vote” on another tanks-for-Ukraine motion that the CDU/CSU initially put forward in June but which was also delayed at the time by delegating it to committee level, the CDU’s Roderich Kiesewetter told POLITICO.\n\nThe SPD’s foreign policy spokesperson Nils Schmid argued that Thursday’s delay of the vote was justified because the opposition was merely orchestrating a political attack, hoping to weaken the government’s unity.\n\nScholz, who was not present at the debate, had said in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly in New York on Tuesday that Germany would support Ukraine “with all its might: financially, economically, with humanitarian aid and also with weapons.”\n\nPressure from coalition partners\n\nThe most striking part of Thursday’s debate was the intensity of criticism from within the ranks of Scholz’s own coalition. Senior lawmakers from the Greens and FDP expressed clear disapproval of the chancellor’s position and stressed that they want Germany to send more heavy arms.\n\n“As Free Democrats, we believe that in the current military situation, in which Ukraine is reclaiming its territory, piece by piece, we must supply at least the Fuchs armored transport vehicle and the Marder infantry fighting vehicle — and if the situation requires it, the Leopard main battle tank as well,” said the FDP’s Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, chair of the Bundestag’s defense committee.\n\nCrucially, Strack-Zimmermann cited the “Zeitenwende” — a historic shift in German foreign and security policy that Scholz announced in February in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — to argue that Scholz shouldn’t justify his reluctance to send tanks by arguing that other allies like the U.S. weren’t sending modern tanks to Ukraine either.\n\n“Zeitenwende doesn’t just mean doing more for the German armed forces, it also means taking leadership and not waiting for our partners to take uncomfortable decisions from us,” she said.\n\nThe Greens’ co-leader Omid Nouripour delivered a broadside against concerns among Social Democrats that the delivery of tanks to Ukraine could trigger an “irrational” escalation by Putin — a fear that was most recently expressed by the SPD’s Secretary General Kevin Kühnert.\n\n“There are arguments that I cannot follow,” Nouripour told the Bundestag. “That our weapons would lead to an escalation presupposes that the Russian side needs excuses for escalation. That is grotesque. Of course they don’t need excuses, the aggression is there,” Nouripour said in reference to Putin’s announcement on Wednesday to mobilize up to 300,000 reservists.\n\nSpent cartridges at a former position of Russian troops in the Kharkiv area, Ukraine, September 22, 2022 | Oleksandr Ratushniak/EPA-EFE\n\nMoving up from No. 18\n\nGermany has so far sent 30 Gepard anti-aircraft tanks, 10 Panzerhaubitze 2000 howitzers and three Mars multiple rocket launchers, as well as various lighter weapons, to Ukraine, according to a government list.\n\nFollowing growing pressure at home and from allies, Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht announced last week that Berlin would also send 50 “Dingo” armored vehicles and two more Mars rocket launchers — contradicting her own arguments from a few days earlier that Germany could not spare any further weapons in support of Ukraine.\n\nStill, despite these increases, Johann Wadephul, deputy chair of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group, argued that Germany had a historical and moral obligation to step up its support for Ukraine.\n\n“If, in the light of mass graves in Bucha and Izium, we are serious in saying: ‘Never again! Germany must ensure that something never happens again’ — then we have to go a decisive step further here,” he said.",

    "Germany’s Well-Timed Crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood": "European Eye on Radicalization\n\nWhen members of the Muslim Brotherhood began arriving in Europe in the 1950s and 1960s, they generally did not intend to stay; they had fled states like Egypt and Syria, where radical republican regimes had cracked down on the Brethren, but they intended to return one day. Eventually, however, a realisation set in that the Brothers would not get to go home, and they began making lives in Europe—and this meant getting involved in politics. For various reasons—some entirely contingent, like the presence of Said Ramadan (1926-1995), the son-in-law of the Brotherhood founder, Hasan al-Banna (1906-1949); some more structural, namely economic power—the Brotherhood was especially drawn to Germany, and the German state has struggled over the past few decades in how to conceptualise and ultimately combat the Islamists on its territory.\n\nAs EER has previously explained, Germany’s government has been through roughly four stages in how it handles the Muslim Brotherhood:\n\n1950-2001: A lack of understanding, and where there was understanding an indifference, from the state about what the Brotherhood was and what its intentions were within Germany. 2001-2011: The 9/11 attacks forced a serious recalibration of German policy towards the Brotherhood, especially once it became clear that Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden had been ideologically influenced by the Brotherhood and that Brotherhood networks in Germany had alarming connections with the 9/11 conspirators. 2011-2014: With the “Arab spring” and the rise of Brotherhood and Brotherhood-linked governments in Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, and elsewhere, Germany came to believe that it would have to accommodate itself to the Brotherhood. This policy swiftly evaporated when the Brotherhood-derived governments collapsed in 2013-14 and the rise of the Islamic State (ISIS) “caliphate”, with the wave of terrorism in Europe, once again reminded the Germans that the Muslim Brotherhood’s program—eroding social cohesion and spreading extremist ideas—was an enabler of extremist groups like ISIS and Al-Qaeda. 2014-present: Germany has turned towards a more comprehensive approach that no longer simply focuses on illegal activity, but seeks to constrict the space for the Brotherhood and its message.\n\nA persistent problem—and not just in Germany—is identifying the Muslim Brotherhood, since its very structure in Europe is designed to disguise its existence, never mind its ideology and activities. In legalistic societies such as Europe’s, this creates immense difficulties for the authorities as they look to map out networks, financial links, hate speech disseminators, and the rest of it.\n\nA further problem for Germany (and others), recently highlighted in a question tabled for the European Union parliament, is whether the state can lead a campaign against the Brotherhood if the Brotherhood is receiving money and other support from outside, which falsely inflate its apparent popularity and strength, allowing it to capture institutions, notably media outlets and departments at universities. The questioner specifically mentioned Qatar as a source of funds for the Brotherhood; they could also have mentioned Turkey, which under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been very active sponsor of the Brotherhood, included in its armed format in Syria and Libya.\n\nDespite the challenges, Germany seems to be heading in the right direction. Signs of this change came earlier this year, when German intelligence highlighted in public its concerns about the Brotherhood. Likewise, the recent decision of the Central Council of Muslims in Germany (Zentralrat der Muslime in Deutschland or ZMD) to expel the “German Muslim Community” (DMG), one of Brotherhood façades reflects the changed mood in Germany.\n\nBerlin is clearly following the model set out by Austria and France in terms of dealing with “non-violent” Islamism; those countries have found sophisticated ways of identifying the Brotherhood structure, as well as more blunt, highly effective means of cutting off the Brotherhood’s foreign financiers and extremist potential. For instance, France has closed multiple mosques that support the Muslim Brotherhood’s ideology, and has enacted policies to vet imams. It can be added that a state with a much less aggressive anti-Islamist posture, Sweden, has recently taken steps to curb the Brotherhood’s space to operate.\n\nGermany, then, is moving within a consensus in Europe as it confronts the Muslim Brotherhood, which for domestic political reasons is very important to the sustainability of the policy. Another fortuitous aspect in the timing is that the Brotherhood itself is falling apart: it means even relatively minimal can have a serious impact in degrading the Muslim Brotherhood’s efforts to spread its extremist ideology.",

    "Germany wants EU citizens to be banned from holding top posts in Russian companies": "Germany proposes that all EU member states prohibit their citizens from holding positions of top managers in Russian state-owned companies.\n\nThe corresponding restriction could be introduced as part of the eighth package of sanctions, Guildhall reports with reference to Suddeutsche Zeitung.\n\nThe German authorities outlined their idea in a document that was sent to other EU countries. Berlin's proposal is to ban EU citizens from the boards or supervisory boards of Russia’s government-owned companies.\n\nRead also: Zelensky appoints new ambassador to Germany\n\nThe German authorities argue that in this way, it would be possible to hinder the Kremlin's attempts to increase political pressure on the EU member states and restrict corruption.\n\nAt the same time, the ban is not expected to extend to the European-based subsidiaries of Russian companies.\n\nIt should be recalled that the ex-Chancellor of Germany, Gerhard Schroeder, had worked as the head of the board of directors of Rosneft until he quit in May 2022. Schroeder is considered Putin’s “friend,” while his work for the Russian regime bore reputational costs for Germany.\n\nAs reported earlier, the eighth package of sanctions is unlikely to include a cap on Russian oil prices.",
    "Germany announces $65bn plan to combat rising energy prices": "Several EU nations announce emergency measures to combat skyrocketing energy prices in the wake of Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\nThe German government has announced a $65bn plan to help people and businesses cope with soaring prices as several European nations introduce emergency measures to prepare for a long winter in the wake of disruption in Russian gas supplies to Europe following the Ukraine war.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Sunday announced a series of measures in light of expectations that energy costs would soar in the coming months. Energy prices have skyrocketed as Europe has been trying to wean itself off Russian energy following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in late February.\n\nTwo days ago, Moscow shut a main pipeline supplying gas to Europe indefinitely, forcing countries like Germany to seek alternative energy supplies elsewhere.\n\nScholz said his government had been planning for a total halt in gas deliveries in December but he promised that his country would make it through the winter.\n\n“Russia is no longer a reliable energy partner,” Scholz told a news conference in Berlin.\n\nThe German leader said the package is aimed at shielding customers and businesses from soaring inflation with measures including benefit hikes and a public transport subsidy.\n\nIncome tax-paying workers will receive a one-off energy price allowance of $300, while families will receive a one-time bonus of $100 per child, which doubles for those on low incomes.\n\nOver the next few years, some $12bn to $13bn will be allocated annually to subsidise renovations to old buildings.\n\nHowever, German households will have to pay almost $500 more a year for gas after a levy was set to help utilities cover the cost of replacing Russian supplies.\n\nThe levy, introduced to help Uniper and other importers cope with soaring prices, will be imposed from October 1 and will run until April 2024.\n\n‘A decisive energy blow’\n\nIn his daily video address on Saturday night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told Europeans to expect a difficult winter after Moscow shut down the Nord Stream 1 pipeline.\n\n“Russia is preparing a decisive energy blow on all Europeans for this winter,” he said.\n\nLast week Moscow said it would keep the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, its main gas channel to Germany, closed and G7 countries announced a planned price cap on Russian oil exports.\n\nThe Kremlin said it would stop selling oil to any countries that implemented the cap.\n\n“The German government is saying the country can last the winter, having built up gas reserves to 85 percent of capacity,” said Al Jazeera’s Harry Fawcett.\n\n“But energy stockpiling by Germany and other European countries has helped send prices skyward along with fears for millions facing fuel poverty.”\n\nCountries across Europe are considering similar measures.\n\nIn Italy, the government recently approved a $17bn aid package to help shield firms and families from galloping energy costs and rising consumer prices.\n\nThat comes on top of some $35bn budgeted since January to soften the effect of sky-high electricity, gas and petrol costs.\n\nUnder the package, Rome extended to the fourth quarter existing measures aimed at cutting electricity and gas bills for low-income families as well as reducing so-called “system-cost” levies.\n\nA cut in excise duties on fuel at the pump that was set to expire on August 21 was extended to September 20.\n\nItaly is also considering preventing energy companies from making unilateral changes to electricity and gas supply contracts until April 2023, according to draft measures approved by the government in early August.\n\nCost-of-living crisis\n\n“Italy has spent 100 billion euros on gas and energy and it’s one of the most exposed to Russian imports,” said Ben Aris, founder and editor of bne IntelliNews, a specialist business, economy and finance outlet covering Russia and Eastern Europe.\n\n“To put that in context, it costs around 12 billion euros for a country like that. This is very expensive and what we’re seeing now is the costs starting to spill over,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nFinland and Sweden on Sunday also announced plans to offer billions of dollars in liquidity guarantees to energy companies in their countries after Russia’s Gazprom shut the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline, deepening Europe’s energy crisis.\n\nFinland is aiming to offer $10bn and Sweden plans to offer $23.2bn (250 billion Swedish crowns) in liquidity guarantees.\n\n“The government’s programme is a last-resort financing option for companies that would otherwise be threatened with insolvency,” Finland Prime Minister Sanna Marin said at a news conference.\n\nMeanwhile, UK Conservative leadership hopeful Liz Truss has announced she intends to outline her vision on how to deal with rising energy costs within a week if she becomes prime minister on Tuesday.\n\nThe United Kingdom has a price cap on the most widely used household energy contracts but energy bills will jump 80 percent, to an average of 3,549 pounds ($4,188) a year from October, regulator Ofgem said, calling it a “crisis” that needed to be tackled by urgent and decisive government intervention.",
    "England v Germany and a probable two-month long social-media tantrum": "THE NATURAL NATIONAL ORDER\n\nWales are off to their first World Cup in 64 years. Norn Iron have finally won, actually won, a game in the Nations League. And Scotland are currently on a three-match winning tear-up, dangerously close to significant achievement for the first time since 1872. What is all this? Do none of the old certainties apply any more? The Fiver feels so old and confused. Imagine how thankful we are, then, for the recent efforts of Gareth Southgate and his England team. The last few years of success and excitement haven’t sat well with us at all, you see. It’s been extremely discombobulating. So it’s very comforting to see England drifting back towards their old sweet spot, a couple of notches above rank incompetence, hovering just below the middle, between underwhelming and meh. Ah, that’s better. Like sinking into an old armchair with no seat cushion, or a tepid bath.\n\nNot that everyone is as chuffed as The Fiver with the way England are carrying on at the minute. Jude Bellingham was the only player who bothered to turn up for the game against Italy on Friday night, and yet another Nations League defeat was inevitable against 11 men. After England’s relegation from League A was confirmed, Southgate went over to thank the travelling support only to be met with two words: trenchant abuse. All of which means that, while Monday’s Wembley showdown with old pals Germany is now technically academic – Germany can’t win the group, while England are doomed – everyone knows full well how much is riding on it. Can England put on a show to avert an 80,000-strong lid-flipping catastrophe and two-month-long social-media tantrum?\n\nWe’re betting heavily on Perhaps Not. Southgate goes into England’s final game before their Human Rights World Cup campaign full of his trademark positivity, promising to “keep doing the right things every day to keep improving. For me, it’s a great challenge to lead the team through a moment like this.” Whether he’d have hand-picked the Germans for the game that will dictate the national mood for the entirety of autumn is another matter. Germany may have just lost at home to Hungary, but they also recently put five past Italy. Should England be unable to snap their five-game winless sequence against a team who have only lost one of their last 14, the pressure on Southgate could become almost unbearable. Most of the noise will certainly be unlistenable. Good luck, then, England: here’s to a morale-restoring win.

    "What I learnt about Germans at the first post-pandemic Oktoberfest": "On leaving Germany, I’m asked to fill in an online form, which requests my reason for departure. I write “Lederhosen”.\n\nIt’s not that they look silly (though they do). It’s not that they mark me out instantly as a tourist (they don’t, actually; plenty of locals are wearing them). It’s – and I’m sorry, there’s no non-invasive way of saying this – the chafing.\n\nFortunately, there is a lubricant-cum-emollient-cum-anaesthetic available, in one-litre (two-pint!) doses, as I’m attending the opening weekend of Oktoberfest 2022. Munich’s is the original and beeriest – founded in 1810 to mark the marriage of King Ludwig (God knows what his stag do was like) – and this year’s is being billed as potentially the wildest ever, since it swaggers back after a two-year disco nap necessitated by eine kleine deadly pandemic.\n\nThat global party-pooper is still making its presence felt in Munich: masks are compulsory on all public transport, and (rule-respecters that the Germans are) everyone complies. But the mask slips rather once you hit Theresienwiese, the 100-acre home of Oktoberfest. Here, I discover, the vibe is punters packed in 10-to-a-table, embraces from strangers, and generally partying like it’s 2019.",
    "Germany’s Die Linke on verge of split over sanctions on Russia": "Germany’s Die Linke could split into two parties over the Ukraine war, as the ailing leftwing party’s indecisive stance over economic sanctions against Russia triggered a series of high-profile resignations this week.\n\nThe German Left party’s future has hung in a precarious balance since it snuck into the national parliament last autumn under a special provision for parties that win three or more constituency seats. Should three of its 39 delegates resign from the party, Die Linke would lose its status as a parliamentary group and attached privileges over speaking times and committee memberships.\n\nParty insiders say such resignations are a matter of when, not if, after a week of vicious public in-fighting over a speech in which the former co-leader Sahra Wagenknecht accused the German government of “launching an unprecedented economic war against our most important energy supplier”.\n\nSupporters of Wagenknecht, a controversial but prominent figurehead, are already hatching plans for a breakaway party to compete in the 2024 European elections, the German newspaper Taz reported this week.\n\nSuch a split would be likely to spell the end of Die Linke, 15 years after it was founded in a merger between the successor to East Germany’s Socialist Unity party and former Social Democrats disillusioned by their party’s direction under Gerhard Schröder, and just under a decade after it formed the largest opposition force in the Bundestag’s 2013-17 term.\n\nIn her speech last Thursday, Wagenknecht had called chancellor Olaf Scholz’s left-leaning governing coalition “the stupidest government in Europe” because it imposed sanctions on Russia, which supplied over half of Germany’s gas needs before the start of the war in the spring.\n\n“Yes, of course the war in Ukraine is a crime”, Wagenknecht said. “But how dumb is the idea that we can punish Putin by pushing millions of German families into poverty and destroy our economy while Gazprom makes record profits?” The speech was greeted with applause not only by the Linke leadership but also by delegates of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD).\n\nWagenknecht no longer holds any official positions in Die Linke, but was nominated to be its sole speaker in the recent parliamentary session on the national climate budget.\n\nIn the run-up to the speech, Die Linke’s parliamentary co-chair Dietmar Bartsch had reportedly urged Wagenknecht to avoid calling for an opening of Nord Stream 2, the Russian gas pipeline project that was halted shortly before the invasion of Ukraine in February.\n\nWhile the 53-year-old did not mention Nord Stream 2, her “economic war” comments proved incendiary. Even though the German government has used similar language to describe its standoff with the Kremlin over gas deliveries, Wagenknecht suggested that the act of aggression in this conflict had been initiated by the west.\n\n“The thesis that the federal republic of Germany is leading an economic war against Russia reverses cause and effect”, said Bodo Ramelow, the Left party state premier for Thuringia. “The phrase ‘the USA’s economic war against Russia’ is Kremlin propaganda”, said Martina Renner, a former deputy leader of the leftwing outfit.\n\nWhile Die Linke has broadly opposed the delivery of heavy weapons to Ukraine, it voted in favour of economic sanctions against Russia in May, and a party congress in June condemned Putin’s war of aggression in Ukraine as “imperialist”.\n\nSplits in the leftwing party, present since Die Linke’s founding, have become increasingly entrenched in recent years.\n\nThe biggest and most bitter split is between reformists who see the party’s future in a space where different union and social justice movements overlap, and those more traditional, nationalist leftists gathered around Wagenknecht, who accuse what they call the “lifestyle left” of having betrayed the party’s traditional working-class base.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With the party’s parliamentary status in a fine balance, there have until now been few attempts to rock the boat by seeking an open conflict.\n\nWagenknecht had ended her speech by calling for the resignation of the minister for economic affairs, Robert Habeck. Instead, her contribution triggered the resignations of two high-profile members.\n\nUlrich Schneider, the head of the German welfare association Der Paritätische, on Monday announced via Twitter he had handed in his membership over the party letting Wagenknecht take the podium. “That was too much”, said Schneider, who heads Germany’s largest umbrella organisation of self-help initiatives in the area of health and social work.\n\nFabio di Masi, a former Linke MP who had remained its most prolific financial expert even after standing down as an MP last year, said a day later he was also handing in his membership, as he no longer wanted to bear responsibility for the “blatant failure of key actors in this party”.\n\nThe draining of support is reflected at a grassroot level. According to internal party figures seen by the Guardian, Die Linke has lost more than 3,000 members – or 5.5% of its total membership –in the first half of this year.\n\nAfter gaining 4.9% of the vote at federal elections last September, the leftwing party has failed to make it over the electoral threshold at five consecutive state elections.",
    "Germany's Zeitenwende: Too Little, Too Late?": "In Europe the end of the Cold War ushered in a new era marked by absence of Realpolitik. The mere idea of war on the continent suddenly became unimaginable and the concept of military power slipped into oblivion for many European countries. Europeans soon became convinced that peace would persist and any efforts against stability would be hindered by the economic interdependence amongst states. Although they were proven wrong on multiple occasions (most remarkably in Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014), they were yet not willing to accept the fact that their theory of interdependence does not hold and that military power is still of paramount importance in world politics. This was soon to change with the full-fledged war Russia would start in Ukraine on February 24. With war on their footstep, European countries were forced to come to terms with the reality that they needed military capabilities and alliances to ensure their safety. In line with this radical shift in European mindset, Finland and Sweden sought NATO membership after decades long neutrality, and the matter of neutrality also became a controversial issue in other EU countries not party to NATO.\n\nBeing a leading economic and political power in Europe, Germany was also strongly influenced by these developments and had to adjust its ‘old belief system’ to the new realities on the ground. Olaf Scholz, Chancellor of Germany, did not wait long before calling the start of war in Ukraine “Zeitenwende” (a watershed moment) in his ‘revolutionary’ speech. Indeed, the Russian invasion of Ukraine marks a turning point not only for German politics but also for the public opinion in the country. Following the invasion almost a half of the population changed their opinion in favour of increasing defence spending to 2 percent of GDP. This alone stands to show how dramatically threat perceptions of Germany had changed within a few days, necessitating the formulation of new German foreign and defence policy.\n\nDuring his speech on February 27, Olaf Scholz outlined the principles that were to guide German foreign and defence policy in this new “era.” According to the Chancellor, Zeitenwende meant that Germany had to leave its pacifist stance aside, supplying Ukraine with weapons, increasing its defence capabilities, and fulfilling its obligations towards NATO allies. Furthermore, Germany’s Russia policy was to undergo dramatic changes with the implementation of a wide-range of sanctions on the former ‘partner’ and reduction of dependence on Russian fossil fuels. These changes proposed by the Chancellor were quite far-reaching and gathered broad domestic and international support at the time of their announcement. However unprecedented these changes may be for Germany, they were without doubt belated. Germany had, in fact, long been called by its allies to increase its defence spending and decrease its dependence on Russian natural gas. Despite all the warnings, the German government had seen a little merit in changing its ways until the very onset of war in Ukraine. Now that Germany has finally decided to reform its foreign and defence policy, many are interested whether enough is being done by the government. This is the question I aim to examine in the following.\n\nFirst and foremost, Olaf Scholz said that Russia’s aggression against Ukraine calls for “an unequivocal response” which Germany was willing to give by providing Ukraine with weapons. Even though support for Ukraine stands at the very core of the Chancellor’s 27 February speech (indeed, it is the very first action plan Olaf Scholz speaks of during his speech), Europe’s economic powerhouse lags much behind Poland and the UK as far as the delivery of weapons to Ukraine is concerned. Even when one looks into the data on general bilateral aid pledged to Ukraine by individual countries (as a share of their GDP), one notices that Germany with 0.08% of its GDP does not make it to the top 10 of the list.\n\nGermany has been particularly reluctant in sending heavy weapons to Ukraine. Initially, Olaf Scholz stated that the delivery of heavy weapons to Ukraine could lead to an escalation between NATO and Russia. As other NATO countries sending weapons caused no such ‘catastrophe’ feared by the Chancellor, his argument turned out to be a mere excuse not to deliver heavy weapons. Even though Germany has now agreed to provide Ukraine with heavy weapons, it does so in a rather slow manner drawing criticism from its allies such as Poland. President Zelensky has also been discontent with the level of military support provided by Germany: “Every leader of our partner countries and naturally the Chancellor as well knows exactly what Ukraine needs. It’s just that the (weapons) deliveries from Germany are still less than they could be.” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba in his turn has complained of the delays in delivery of German weapons: “There are countries from which we are awaiting deliveries, and other countries for which we have grown tired of waiting. Germany belongs to the second group.”\n\nThe Chancellor is facing fierce criticism from within his government as well. Friedrich Merz, the opposition leader, for instance, denounced Scholz’s Ukraine policy, accusing him of pursuing a “hidden agenda.” Despite all the international and domestic pressure, there has been little progress in Germany’s Ukraine policy over the past six months. Not only did Germany fail to deliver on its promise to provide its allies with modern weapons in return for the Soviet arms sent to Ukraine (so-called ring exchange), but it also ramped down its direct military support for Ukraine by making no new commitments to the country during July. Most recently, Olaf Scholz pledged €500 million in military equipment to Ukraine breaking the stagnation. However significant this development may seem, it is riddled with the same problems typical to all the previous commitments made by the German government – it takes too long for Germany to actually deliver on them.\n\nSecondly, in his Zeitenwende speech Olaf Scholz pledged the Bundeswehr a special fund in the amount of €100 billion which is supposed to be used to equip German troops with modern technology and armament and thereby increase the country’s defence capabilities. This fund is meant to ensure Germany fulfils its ‘2 percent’ commitment towards its NATO allies. The recent study conducted by the German Economic Institute, however, concludes that Germany’s defence expenditures are to remain below ‘2 percent’ target until 2027 despite the allocation of the special fund. They also fear that by 2027 the special fund will have been completely used up and Germany will be at a greater deficit as far as its ‘2 percent’ commitment is concerned. Not only does the special fund allocated for the Bundeswehr prove to be no good for Germany to keep its promise towards NATO but also this amount is to make a small contribution to the defence capabilities of the country. If one factors in high inflation rates and the fact that Germany will use a part of this special fund for financing pre-existing projects, then merely half of the initially promised sum remains for the actual procurement of military supplies. Whether Germany can equip its “more or less bare” Bundeswehr (in the words of a top German general, Alfons Mais) with the necessary military technology using €60 billion is doubtful. The defence ministry’s ‘murky past’ and bad reputation in handling its budget only add to these doubts. One thing, however, is clear: if Germany keeps moving forward at this pace, it is not soon to be the military power its allies would hope it to be. It is also questionable how Germany is going to defend its allies, to which the Chancellor vowed in his ‘historical speech’, so long as the country lacks the military means to do so.\n\nThirdly, in his speech Olaf Scholz stressed that energy supply is a matter of security and that his government would undertake a number of measures to reduce Germany’s dependence on individual suppliers referring to Russia. The German government aims to decrease its dependence on Russian gas mainly by importing liquid gas from other sources. In order to be able to import liquid gas, five LNG terminals are to be built in Germany, two of which (in Wilhelmshaven and Brunsbuettel) are expected to be operational as soon as the end of this year.\n\nIn addition, Germany now imports significantly more natural gas from Norway in an attempt to reduce its heavy dependence on Russia. Between January and April alone Norway delivered 15 bln. cubic metre gas to Germany, twice as much compared to the same time period last year. Norway is now the biggest gas exporter to Germany, supplying almost a third of the country’s gas needs.\n\nWhile Germany depended on Russia for almost 55 percent of its gas imports before the Ukraine war, this number now lies at around 30 percent, which is remarkable progress. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain whether or how long Russia will keep delivering gas to Germany, which forces the government to resort to some temporary measures such as switching from gas-fired electric plants to coal-fired ones in order to save as much gas as possible for the winter. Although it’s a more long-term measure, the German government is also making significant efforts to increase the share of renewable energy and thereby reduce its reliance on fossil fuel imports. While the idea is not completely novel, this process is now being accelerated by the government. All in all, Germany has made a great leap in terms of reducing its gas dependence from Russia, but much remains to be done.\n\nLast but not least, on February 27 the Chancellor emphasised that Russia would have to pay the price for its war in Ukraine mentioning the sanctions imposed by the EU on Russia. Despite his rhetoric on this matter, Scholz’s government has been amongst the EU members opposing the Union-wide ban on Russian gas, which would perhaps be the most costly and thus the most effective sanction against Russia. Considering the German economy’s heavy reliance on Russian gas, one may understand the country’s unwillingness to impose such a ban. However, this is not the only instance in which the German government has opposed an EU-wide sanction against Russia. Recently, Scholz said that his government would not support the EU-wide ban on tourist visas for Russians, maintaining that it is Putin’s war, not Russians’. This event is followed by the controversial statement of Wolfgang Kubicki, Bundestag vice president, that Germany should activate the Nord Stream 2 pipeline as soon as possible. This behaviour displayed by the German government undermines the West’s unity and contradicts what Scholz’s Zeitenwende promised – a strong stance towards Russia.\n\nToday, Germany’s foreign policy and military undergo dramatic changes that no one would have expected before the Ukraine war. While the German government has done a lot in the past six months, there is still a long way to go before Germany emerges as a strong geopolitical actor Scholz envisioned in his Zeitenwende speech.\n\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the authors alone and do not necessarily reflect those of Geopoliticalmonitor.com\n\nEltaj Rajabov is a research intern at the Topchubashov Center, a Baku-based think tank.

    "Critics: Finland in ‘hostile’ environment over Germany’s Uniper nationalisation": "The news that the German ailing energy giant Uniper may be nationalised has rallied the Finnish opposition, and the government is being criticised for surrendering to Germany without proper resistance.\n\nThe state-owned (51%) Finnish energy company Fortum is the majority owner of Uniper by 78%. Its share will soon be diluted down to 56%.\n\nEarlier in the summer, efforts to find a solution for troubled German energy giant Uniper’s financial problems turned into an arm wrestling match between Helsinki and Berlin.\n\nFinns flex muscle with Germany over energy crunch Efforts to find a solution for troubled German energy giant Uniper’s financial problems are turning into an arm wrestling match between Helsinki and Berlin.\n\nFinland’s Minister of Ownership Steering Tytti Tuppurainen is due to travel Berlin on Thursday to discuss the …\n\nIn July, a €15 billion so-called stabilisation package was signed between Fortum, the German government and Uniper to rescue the company, whose losses were mounting due to gas supply cuts from Russia. But the energy giant says that is no longer enough.\n\nOn Wednesday, Uniper said the government in Berlin might take a controlling stake in the company.\n\n“The parties are looking into alternative solutions, inter alia a straight equity increase that would result in a significant majority participation by the German Government,” Uniper said in a statement according to Reuters.\n\nIn April, the German government passed the German Gazprom subsidiary to the federal network agency as a trustee in a bid to save the country’s gas market, and last week seized assets of another state-owned Russian energy company – Rosneft Germany, which owns the problematic Schwedt oil refinery.\n\nRosneft subsidiary in Germany placed under state trusteeship After Gazprom Germania was placed under trusteeship earlier this year, Berlin plans to seize another state-owned Russian energy company – Rosneft Germany, which owns the problematic Schwedt oil refinery.\n\nThe Finnish government reacted on Friday, with Minister of European Affairs and Ownership Steering Tytti Tuppurainen telling the Finnish parliament, “it is absolutely clear that Finland will not allow Germany to nationalise Uniper without compensation”.\n\nFinland demands compensation if Uniper is nationalised Finland will not accept the nationalisation of German energy company Uniper without compensation, said European Affairs and Ownership Steering Minister Tytti Tuppurainen on Wednesday. The tight-lipped minister commented on the issue briefly after both Bloomberg and Reuters broke the news based …\n\nEarlier in the year, Fortum helped Uniper with an €8 billion credit line. Political opposition in Finland sees Germany now betraying the July deal and accuses the Finnish government of being too lenient in the first place.\n\nAccording to the main opposition party chair, the National Coalition (NCP) Kai Mykkänen, Germany is intentionally lowering Uniper’s value, and, once it hits rock bottom, the company will be nationalised, and Finnish taxpayers have de facto paid German gas bills.\n\n”We are bound with international agreements. In this case, they should protect us from this kind of situation. A country which has invested into another country is made arbitrarily to pay losses of billions of euros,” Mykkänen told Finish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat on Saturday, urging Prime Minister Sanna Marin to buy a plane ticket to Berlin, contact the EU and ask whether the investment protection principles still stand.\n\nMykkänen also accused Germany of violating the EU Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) and its competition rules by not allowing higher gas prices to be transferred earlier to customers.\n\nThe liberal-conservative NCP has been surging in the polls ahead of parliamentary elections next April, with 24.2% support, besting the ruling Social Democratic Party trailing 19.4% earlier this month.\n\nNational Coalition Party extends its lead in Finland The liberal-conservative National Coalition Party (NCP) has kept its leading position in the new poll and has widened the gap with the Social Democratic Party.

    "Germany seeks way out of energy and inflation crisis": "As the leader of the largest opposition party, Friedrich Merz used Wednesday's budget debate in the Bundestag to attack the government head on. His conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) had led the German government for 16 years before they lost the election in 2021. Since the party's historically poor showing then, the conservatives have managed to somewhat rebound and are currently polling as the strongest party in Germany.\n\n67-year-old Merz is a former head of the supervisory board of BlackRock Germany and known as a staunch conservative. He took aim mainly at Economy Minister Robert Habeck of the environmentalist Greens.\n\nOn Monday, Habeck had announced that the last nuclear power plants would cease operation, but two would be left in standby mode until April next year.\n\n\"The whole world is looking at Germany and saying: 'Have these Germans actually gone crazy to shut down three nuclear power plants that would be able to safely supply 10 million households with electricity',\" Merz said.\n\nOpposition leader Friedrich Merz accused Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government of incompetence\n\nThe decision against nuclear power may reassure the Green Party base, he said, but \"possibly irrevocably damage\" Germany as a business location.\n\nMany companies, Merz said, have order books fuller than they've been in years, but can't process them. \"That has something to do with the inflation rate and demonetization and supply chains.\"\n\nScholz, Merz trade barbs in German Bundestag\n\nHabeck and the insolvency\n\nChancellor Olaf Scholz and his economy minister then heard Merz accuse them of lacking \"any compass\" and of being unable \"to think strategically\" in their economic policy.\n\nHabeck seemed \"helpless,\" Merz said, referring with relish to a TV appearance by Habeck in which he seemed unsure what actually constitutes insolvency.\n\nDuring that interview, Habeck was confronted with a statement from the German Association for Small and Medium-Sized Businesses (Deutscher Mittelstands-Bund) that read: \"The reduction in value-added tax on gas or the electricity price brake, which has hardly been specified to date, will primarily provide relief for private consumers.\"\n\n\"An energy-intensive bakery business, for example, is almost completely left behind by the relief measures.\"\n\nSo did Habeck expect a wave of insolvencies at the end of this winter? \"No, I do not,\" he said. \"I can imagine that certain industries will simply stop producing for the time being.\" Whereupon the interviewer pointed out that this, surely, would mean they would actually be insolvent.\n\nChancellor Olaf Scholz pointed out the previous government's shortcomings\n\nA fiery chancellor\n\nChancellor Scholz can't have liked the minister's unfortunate performance, but he didn't let on in the Bundestag. Instead, he vehemently defended his government's policy and made an unusually fiery speech. At first, he briefly stuck to his script and, in his usual matter-of-fact detail, listed what his coalition government had agreed on in their relief package over the weekend.\n\nBut then Scholz got increasingly agitated, his voice grew louder and he clenched his fist — there was nothing of his usual emotionless, sometimes robotic performance. He accused the CDU of making Germany dependent on Russian energy during their time in government.\n\n\"You were incapable of bringing about the expansion of renewable energies. You fought defensive battles against every single wind turbine,\" Scholz said, pointing to the CDU Bundestag members.\n\nHe added that the CDU hadn't even noticed that Germany's gas stores were systematically running dry. \"It is irresponsible CDU policy that has brought us to the current situation,\" he said.\n\nScholz has inside knowledge of the previous government's decision-making procedures, seeing as he was vice chancellor and finance minister in the last four years of Angela Merkel's government.\n\nBut it was a CDU chancellor and economy minister who put the brakes on an expansion of renewables back in 2018.\n\nGermany and nuclear power — a timeline It all began with an 'egg' Germany's first nuclear reactor went online in October 1957 in Garching, near Munich. Given its shape, it was nicknamed the \"atom egg\" and belonged to Munich's Technical University. It was a landmark in nuclear research and a symbol of a new beginning after WWII. In 1961, Germany began to produce energy for civilian use. Atomic energy was seen as safe and secure.\n\nGermany and nuclear power — a timeline The pushback begins In the 1970s, opponents of nuclear energy questioned just how clean nuclear power was, seeing as there was no safe storage site for spent fuel rods. Thousands of protesters clashed with police during a demonstration against the nuclear power plant Brokdorf, in the northern German state of Schleswig-Holstein. \"Nuclear energy? No thanks,\" became the rallying cry for German environmentalists.\n\nGermany and nuclear power — a timeline 'Nuclear energy? No thanks' The danger of nuclear power soon became reality. On March 28, 1979, the plant at Three Mile Island, in the US state of Pennsylvania, had a serious accident. On April 26, 1986, a reactor at the plant near Chernobyl, in Soviet Ukraine, exploded, causing an unprecedented nuclear disaster. A radioactive cloud spread across Europe. A watershed moment for Germany. Protests gained steam.\n\nGermany and nuclear power — a timeline The birth of a new party In 1980, a new party was founded in West Germany: the Greens. Their members were a mix of left-wingers, peaceniks, environmentalists, and nuclear opponents. The party made it into the Bundestag, the German parliament, in 1983. The Chernobyl accident prompted the creation of a federal environment ministry in Germany.\n\nGermany and nuclear power — a timeline Wackersdorf: Tragedy and triumph The Bavarian town of Wackersdorf was set to get a reprocessing plant for spent nuclear fuel rods, but riots broke out. A number of protesters and civil service workers were killed. Hundreds more people were injured. Construction was halted in 1989. The German environmental movement claimed its first major victory.\n\nGermany and nuclear power — a timeline Gorleben: Radioactive waste in a salt mine Meanwhile up north, the town of Gorleben, in the state of Lower Saxony, became a symbol of the fight against nuclear waste. The salt dome there was picked as an interim storage facility for nuclear waste. But already in 1977, a large-scale study revealed that groundwater was seeping in, leading to the corrosion of the barrels holding the waste, posing major risks of radioactive contamination.\n\nGermany and nuclear power — a timeline SPD-Green exit plans Germany's exit from nuclear power has been marked by a back and forth. The center-left coalition of Social Democrats (SPD) and Greens under Chancellor Gerhard Schröder implemented the phaseout of nuclear energy in an agreement with big energy companies in 2001. An individual lifespan was determined for all 19 German nuclear power plants, requiring the last to be shut down by 2021.\n\nGermany and nuclear power — a timeline Rolling back — and rolling back the rollback In 2010, the center-right government under Chancellor Angela Merkel revoked the deal and decided to extend the operating lives of nuclear power plants. But following the accident at the Fukushima plant in Japan in 2011, Merkel abruptly announced the end to Germany's era of nuclear power by December 31, 2022. On July 30, 2011, the Bundestag voted to shut down all nuclear reactors by then.\n\nGermany and nuclear power — a timeline Celebrating the end of nuclear energy in Germany After years of especially intense protest, activists in Grohnde, Gundremmingen, and Brokdorf celebrated when the power plants there were switched off at the end of 2021. But the search for a safe repository will continue. The nationwide search for a geologically suitable safe site for high-level radioactive waste is to be completed by 2031.\n\nGermany and nuclear power — a timeline A little extension In response to energy shortages due to the war in Ukraine, Germany has extended the lifespan of two of its remaining three nuclear power plants. Economy Minister Robert Habeck (r.) announced that Isar 2 and Neckarwestheim 2 are to be put on standby until mid-April 2023. This dashed conservatives' hopes for a complete reversal of the decision to exit nuclear power. Author: Ralf Bosen\n\n\n\nElectricity and gas price caps to come\n\nThe current government, Scholz pointed out, had ensured that the gas storage facilities are already full again and it will also ensure that energy prices are lowered, referring to European Union plans for an electricity and gas price cap and the construction of new LNG terminals. \"We will get through the winter,\" the chancellor stressed, adding that the country will \"become independent of energy from Russia at great speed.\"\n\nWith increasing speed, the energy crisis is turning into an economic crisis that threatens to drag the country into recession. The coalition wants to spend €65 billion ($65 billion) to cushion the greatest hardships.\n\nThere are also differences in the government about the right course through the crisis. The neoliberal Free Democratsare in favor of giving German nuclear power plants a lifeline. They are among the safest in all of Europe, say FDP leaders. This stance sees them side with their old allies, the CDU. But the Green Party is violently opposed.\n\nFinance Minister Christian Lindner (FDP, l) and Economy Minister Robert Habeck (Greens) often don't see eye to eye\n\nPoor polls\n\nThis comes against a backdrop of opinion polls that are dismal, especially for Olaf Scholz's Social Democrats (SPD). The center-left SPD won last year's federal election with 25.7% of the vote, but now they have fallen again to around 17%.\n\nThe FDP has also lost support, slipping from 11.5% in the general election to a mere 8%. Seeing as they also suffered a significant defeat in recent regional polls, Finance Minister Christian Lindner's party has every reason for concern.\n\nThe Greens, on the other hand, have made significant gains in the nine months since coming to power and are stronger than the SPD in the opinion polls: At 23%, they are currently the second strongest party — behind the conservative opposition of CDU/CSU.\n\nThe Greens performed well in recent regional elections and are now part of government in 10 of Germany's 16 states. The Greens' leading politicians, Economy Minister Habeck and Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, are also by far the country's most popular politicians.\n\nThis has led to jealousy within the coalition. In recent weeks, prominent politicians from the coalition parties were repeatedly exchanging barbed remarks. Publicly, Olaf Scholz is staying out of the fray, but it can be assumed that he is pushing for unity behind the scenes.\n\nAll eyes are now on the next state election in Lower Saxony on October 9. The result for the SPD head of government in the northern state will have an impact at the federal level.\n\nThe Greens are to hold a party conference in October. After that, at the latest, the dispute over extending the operating lives of nuclear power plants will continue.\n\nBy then, of course, autumn will have arrived and the nights will be noticeably cooler. \"Whether it works out in winter without rationing stands and falls with the behavior of private households,\" warned the head of the Federal Network Agency Klaus Müller at the beginning of September.\n\nEnergy prices are now going in only one direction: up.\n\nThat is why it's not only CDU leader Friedrich Merz talking about an \"existential crisis\" in the Bundestag. He warns: \"The situation may come to a dramatic head in the coming days, weeks, months.\"\n\nThis article was originally written in German.\n\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

    "Clarkson University Honors Student Travels to Germany for Research": "Clarkson University Honors Program senior Gracie DeLaBruere of Derby, Vt., performed research this summer, during which she traveled to Germany with her professor.\n\nThe pre-physical therapy psychology major traveled with Clarkson Psychology Department Chair Professor Andreas Wilke and three other research assistants who work with her in Wilke's Evolution and Cognition Laboratory.\n\nTheir project, researching statistical thinking in children, which is also DeLaBruere's honors capstone, is funded by the National Science Foundation. The research team traveled to Germany for part of the summer to work with their collaborators in the Naturalistic Social Cognition lab at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin.\n\n\"This project will help us understand how people come to search for resources when they encounter different statistical patterns,\" says DeLaBruere. \"We are specifically looking at children aged 3-10 and how they perceive these patterns. The study involves three short iPad games and is cross-cultural, meaning the same study we are conducting in the United States is being conducted at the Max Planck Institute.\"\n\nDeLaBruere has been working on this project alongside Wilke since its pilot stages in the summer before her first year at Clarkson.\n\n\"While we were there, we assisted in training the German research assistants and helped them start the testing process,\" says DeLaBruere. \"We also attended scientific talks and spent some time sightseeing and experiencing the culture. We even visited Sanssouci Palace in Germany's Potsdam, which was once the summer home of Prussian King Frederick the Great.\"\n\nDeLaBruere who had never traveled beyond North America, says that going abroad was a great experience. \"I was able to experience different cultures and meet some amazing people,\" she says. \"Research-wise, it allowed me to meet some extremely important scientists in the psychology field – like Gerd Gigerenzer, who has helped to shape our understanding of the role heuristics in human decision-making processes\"\n\nBack at Clarkson, during the Honors Summer Research Program, DeLaBruere continued the in-person data collection with 161 children being tested in total.\n\nDeLaBruere says she chose the Clarkson Honors Program because she knew that it would tailor her education to prepare her for graduate school. She also wanted to surround herself with other students who were highly motivated and had similar goals.\n\n\"Gracie has truly made the most of the many opportunities that Clarkson and the Honors Program have to offer,\" says Honors Program Director Professor Kate Krueger. \"Her skills have grown considerably through her experiences in summer research every year, including in the honors pre-frosh summer program. She is enthusiastic, willing to learn, skilled, and a wonderful representation of a Clarkson student.\"\n\n\"The emphasis Clarkson places on undergraduate research is not something I have seen at many other schools,\" says DeLaBruere. \"To be able to work alongside professors and develop research skills wasn't something that I thought I would be able to do before graduate school, but Clarkson made it happen.\"\n\nDeLaBruere plans to earn a doctorate in physical therapy and one day specialize in pediatric physical therapy."
