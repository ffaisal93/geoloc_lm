    "As wildfires grow, militaries are torn between combat, climate change": "Climate & Environment As wildfires grow, militaries are torn between combat, climate change Militaries around the world are fighting a new enemy: wildfires, floods and extreme heat. A Slovenian Army helicopter carries water with a bambi bucket to the wildfire near Debni Vrh in Ljubljana, Slovenia, on Aug. 18. (Špela Škulj for The Washington Post)\n\nListen 11 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nKOSTANJEVICA NA KRASU, Slovenia — The wildfire was exploding across Slovenia’s dry mountainsides, burning up pine trees and blotting out both the sun and the ground. Lieutenant Colonel Aleš Ogrinc needed to call on all his military training as he steered his combat helicopter toward the flames to drop a payload of water.\n\nIn his 30-year career, he had deployed to Bosnia and Kosovo. This time the enemy was Slovenia’s largest-ever blaze, during the hottest European summer on record.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“You have different motivations,” Ogrinc said. “If you’re in Afghanistan or Iraq, that’s a common goal, but here you are fighting for your home, for your country.”\n\nEuropean militaries are fighting fires this summer that are burning with ever greater scope and intensity, battling record blazes across a continent that is also seized by war in Ukraine and the need to defend against an increasingly dangerous Kremlin. From the high cliffs of Portugal to the stony mountains of Greece, militaries have been the wildfire responders of last resort, bringing air resources and logistical capabilities that far outmuscle their civilian counterparts.\n\nThe twin problem — the war in Ukraine and natural disasters tied to global warming — underscores how climate change can weaken social stability, even when challenges at first glance appear unrelated. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine is making it harder for European militaries to fight wildfires — and the worsening wildfires are making it harder for the militaries to respond to the Kremlin.\n\n“In this situation with Ukraine and wildfires, we are in a dilemma how to balance,” Major General Robert Glavaš, the commander of Slovenia’s military forces, said in an interview. “At one point you need to decide what is important, this or that.”\n\nThe challenge is also increasing in the United States, where National Guard members devoted more than 172,000 personnel days to fighting fires last year, compared to 18,000 in 2019, according to U.S. Army figures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the task is especially pressing in Europe, where militaries shrank for years following the breakup of the Soviet Union. Now they are scrambling to expand to counter the threat of a possible Russian invasion and to rush aid to Ukraine to keep it in the fight. Some generals say that in a warming world, militaries will increasingly have to go beyond their traditional combat-focused operations to face climate-driven demands, such as responding to fires and floods.\n\n“The role of the military will not just be about fighting future enemies, but also about supporting civil authorities in dealing with the effects of climate change,” said Tom Middendorp, a former top commander of the Dutch military who is now chairman of the International Military Council on Climate and Security, a research group that focuses on the security consequences of global warming.\n\nSlovenian defense leaders decided this month to cancel a $343 million purchase of armored troop carriers as they contemplate buying more aircraft that could be used to fight fires. The discussions aren’t directly connected, but policymakers also say they need to make the best use of limited resources. The country donated 35 Yugoslav-era infantry combat vehicles to Ukraine in June.\n\nSlovenian leaders say they need to prepare their military for a future in which there are more intense wildfires. They want to make it easier for the armed forces to get involved in disaster deployments. And they want to invest in military equipment that can also be used for firefighting.\n\nSlovenia’s defense spending is among the lowest in the NATO security alliance, at 1.22 percent of gross domestic product annually. After Russia invaded Ukraine, Slovenian policymakers pledged to reach the NATO guideline, 2 percent, by 2030. They say they need to be ready for wildfires and to increase conventional combat preparedness at the same time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“There will be these disasters of fires or floods. It will be more and more common,” Defense Minister Marjan Šarec said in an interview. “We must spend our money for everything that is needed. Because safety has no price.”\n\n“It’s not a dilemma of cannons or butter,” said Šarec, who has also been a volunteer firefighter. “As a serious country we must do both.”\n\nBut military leaders say the dual-headed challenge can sometimes be significant, and even contradictory.\n\n“Our training is going on in a military way. Exercises. How to use military equipment, how to fight, how to protect. How to defend,” said Glavaš, the head of Slovenia’s military command. “When you stop this training and you go to civilian tasks you need to focus your mind from fighting to something else. It’s very hard sometimes.”\n\nHe said that fighting fires “definitely” had an impact on combat readiness.\n\nSo far this year, wildfires have consumed almost 3,000 square miles of territory in the 27 nations that make up the European Union — far outpacing the previous maximum of 2,300 square miles as of Sept. 17. Europe began collecting wildfire data in 2006.\n\nThis year’s wildfires are nearly three times bigger than the average between 2006 and 2021. For weeks from June through August, heat domes settled across Europe, snapping temperature records, causing droughts and turning the continent’s forests into kindling.\n\n“We have witnessed this summer an alarming acceleration and spread of wildfires,” Janez Lenarčič, the European Union’s top official for crisis management, told top European policymakers this month. He has pushed to expand the pool of E.U.-funded planes available for firefighting. “All these disasters are reinforced by the new reality of climate change, and we need to tackle that jointly.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fire in Slovenia started July 17 in the mountains that push up against the village of Kostanjevica na Krasu, a settlement of about 300 people who live around a few winding streets. The town is perched in the Karst region, which borders Italy. The area is forbidding. Its dry rocky soil makes farming a challenge. The wind blows so fiercely that locals must weigh down their clay-tiled roofs with rocks to keep them from tumbling away. And locals know not to stray too far from established trails because fighting in World War I was so fierce that the hills there are still peppered with unexploded ordinance.\n\n“It was obvious it was going to be a hard summer, fire-wise, but we were not prepared for this,” said Boris Budal, the deputy commander of the fire brigade in nearby Sezana, which helped battle back the flames. “This outgrew our capabilities.”\n\nThis year the pine forests were dry and the underbrush was unkempt, perfect fuel for a fire that quickly gusted out of control. At night, the wind whipped the fire in one direction. Once the sun rose, the air started going another way, helping to spread it across the mountainsides. Immature pine cones heated up and popped open with flames. And on the ground, the leftover munitions kept exploding, making it impossible for firefighters to enter the forests by foot.\n\nThe fire needed to be fought from the sky — so the military was called in to supplement civilian firefighting aircraft with helicopters and heat-imaging drones. In the end, seven nations deployed their militaries to help Slovenia, including three that border Ukraine and have been nervous about the war spilling over their borders. Slovakia sent a Black Hawk military helicopter. Romania sent three air force planes. Hungary sent two combat helicopters with a crew of 13 people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA helicopter crew “just departed to #sLOVEnia to help our allies and close friends to fight huge #wildfires #StrongerTogether #WeAreNato,” Slovakian Defense Minister Jaro Nad tweeted at the time.\n\nOn the ground, soldiers organized many of the firefighting logistics, including driving tankers of water close to the front lines and cooking meals for civilian firefighters and displaced residents. More than 200 members of Slovenia’s armed forces were deployed on the ground, of a total military force of about 5,900.\n\n“The whole cooperation with the military was larger than ever before,” said Budal, who has been a firefighter for 40 years.\n\nNo one died in the fire, but it consumed 15 square miles of forest in Italy and Slovenia. On the Slovenian side, it was triple the size of the previous record.\n\n“A neighbor called me to say, ‘The fire is approaching the village, you should come right away. But I can’t guarantee your house will still be there,’ ” said Marjana Lavrič, a local journalist who lives in Brestovica pri Komnu, a valley village just over a mile from the Italian border. From the garden where she grows grapes, lavender and rosemary, the charred trees are less a hundred yards up steep, rocky hills.\n\nShe said that even after the immediate threat of the fire had passed, it was still possible to see the trees smoldering as she watched from her house, a 19th-century former seminary, at night. Weeks later, among the charred trees, plants had already begun to sprout, including spindly green stalks of wild asparagus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nResidents said they appreciated the help from the military — even if some of them said they were skeptical of military spending more broadly.\n\n“We really thought the village was going to burn down,” said Maja Visenjak Limon, a freelance translator who lives in Hudi Log, a settlement of a few houses at the summit of a steep, switchback road, which was completely enveloped by flames. “I was told they were going to try to wet around the house with the water they had left.”\n\nShe and her husband were told to evacuate three times. Each time, they thought they might never see their home again. They could see a military helicopter making runs out their back windows. But in the end, they — and their possessions — survived.\n\n“A lot of people say, ‘Do we really need a military force? It can’t be big enough to do any damage,’ ” Visenjak Limon said. “People were saying, at last they’re finally doing something.”\n\nSecurity policymakers say they recognize the growing challenge of responding both to traditional threats, such as Russia, and faceless ones, such as climate change. NATO has made climate change an increasingly central part of its discussions in recent years at the same time it has been scrambling to respond to the war in Ukraine.\n\n“Climate change poses a serious risk to countries in the alliance, and we need to use our collective power to address that risk,” said Erin Sikorsky, a former top U.S. intelligence official focused on climate change who is now the director of the Center for Climate and Security, a Washington-based research center. “I think that does create some debate or tension between countries in NATO as they work it out.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis summer, Sikorsky started keeping a record on Twitter of countries that deployed their militaries to fight fires, floods or other climate-related natural disasters. Her list, so far, is 49 emergencies long, from Argentina to Pakistan to Bulgaria to Jackson, Miss.\n\n“You’re seeing it more and more in all different parts of the world,” Sikorsky said.\n\nSome experts warn that if militaries are increasingly getting pulled into natural disasters, they need to do more planning.\n\n“It’s really a question of organization. Are we going to use the military as a backup? Some people think that’s wise,” said Alice Hill, who worked on climate change and resilience on the Obama-era National Security Council and is now at the Council on Foreign Relations. “If you’re using that as a backup, what happens if those needs grow exponentially, as they are doing?”\n\nNejc Trušnovec contributed to this report.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",
    "Illegal Migration Causes Political Furore in Slovenia": "It could cost Slovenia’s pro-migration interior minister her seat that her country is dismantling its border fence modeled on the Hungarian one. Illegal migration is on the rise this year, with the country turning into a migrant corridor.\n\nThe opposition Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS), led by former Prime Minister Janez Jansa, has tabled a motion of censure against Interior Minister Tatjana Bobnar over the increase in migration in Slovenia, according to MTI. SDS MP Branko Grims said at a press conference that the motion was tabled because of the removal of a fence on the Croatian-Slovenian border, which had security and political consequences.\n\n“By the end of August, the police had dealt with more border violations than in the whole of last year,” Grims explained, adding that the number of applications for international protection was also expected to quadruple. “Slovenia is becoming a destination country for illegal migrants,” he noted.\n\nRobert Golob’s pro-migration government, which was elected this spring, announced back in June that it would completely remove the fence on its border with Croatia by the end of the year, which began construction in 2015 in order to protect Slovenia’s territorial integrity and sovereignty.\n\nRelated article Migration on the Rise in Neighboring Slovenia The Hungarian government decided to set up border hunter units, in collaboration with the police. Continue reading\n\nAccording to the Slovenian interior ministry, in the first eight months of the year, authorities arrested 11,409 border crossers in Slovenia, 93 percent more than in the same period last year, and the number of people applying for international protection increased. Some 90 percent of the apprehended illegal immigrants applied for protection in Slovenia. However, most of them leave the country before the end of the asylum procedure to go to Western Europe.\n\nOne reason why illegal migrants choose to cross through Slovenia is that since 2015, Hungary’s southern border has been protected by a fence. The situation in Slovenia has not gone unnoticed in Hungarian politics. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán called migration one of the main challenges of Europe in his speech at the 31st Bálványos Summer Free University and Student Camp in August. Without explicitly naming Slovenia, Viktor Orbán said: “there is a country where the Left has won, and where one of its first measures has been to dismantle its border fence.” The previous Slovenian government was led by the center-right Janez Jansa, who formed an alliance with Viktor Orbán to curb illegal migration. Before the elections, he warned that Robert Golob would dismantle the fence.\n\nFeatured photo: The construction of the Slovenian border fence in 2015, photo by MTI/Varga György",
    "Slovenia calls for suggestions for draft climate change law": "Slovenia is drafting the Climate Change Act to create a legal framework for implementing climate policy and reporting on all its aspects. The goal is to cut net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050.\n\nThe Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning has started to prepare the draft for a law on climate change. It invited all stakeholders to submit proposals by October 21.\n\nThe aim is to create a legal framework in Slovenia for implementing climate policy and reporting on all its aspects. The proposal will be developed in accordance with the Long-term Strategy of the Republic of Slovenia until 2050, the ministry said. The document sets the path for the country to achieve carbon neutrality by the middle of the century.\n\nLegislators from numerous areas will participate in the production of the draft, due to the horizontal and cross-sectoral nature of climate change\n\nThe draft Climate Change Act is envisaged to provide solutions for meeting the goals of international treaties like the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement, the ministry said. It will transpose the European Union’s legislation into Slovenia’s legal system and regulate cooperation with stakeholders, according to the public call.\n\nThe new law will include the climate provisions that are currently part of the Environmental Protection Act, the ministry added. Legislators from areas like education, healthcare, spatial planning, building construction, agriculture, and transportation will be involved in drafting the bill, due to the horizontal and cross-sectoral nature of climate change, the announcement revealed.\n\nThe future climate change law needs to be aligned with the National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) and other strategic documents and action plans at the municipal level. The ministry pointed out that the draft would include provisions related to the operation of the climate change fund.",
    "Slovenia passes an emergency energy package": "A package of three laws designed to ensure a stable supply of electricity and gas this winter, the latest in a long series of measures to address the energy crisis, was passed by the Slovenian parliament on Tuesday.\n\nThe linchpin of the package is a law on measures to control crises in energy supply which will allow the government to order state-owned companies to secure a reliable energy supply.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, the management and coordination of individual parts of the system would be entrusted to the national grid operator, ELES.\n\nThe government will be able to declare a high-risk situation during which power plants and co-generation installations would be able to change their fuel, for example, switch from natural gas to diesel, without the need for a new environmental permit.\n\nIt also provides the legal basis for the government to prescribe the maximum or minimum temperature in public buildings and lighting.\n\nChanges to the gas supply act will ensure that no consumer will be left without gas in the event their supplier closes shop, according to Infrastructure Minister Bojan Kumer.\n\nApart from households, preschools, elementary schools and health centres, other so-called protected users will almost automatically be taken over by substitute suppliers in the event their original supplier goes belly up.\n\nThe third part of the package is a guarantee scheme for state-owned electricity producers GEN Energija and HSE, and the gas distributor Geoplin.\n\nThe guarantees will cover gas and electricity purchases outside the EU, with HSE’s guarantees capped at €800 million in principal and GEN Energija and Geoplin at €400 million each.\n\nWhile the legislation was passed without dissenting votes, some of the opposition abstained on the grounds that broader measures should be implemented.\n\nOne opposition party tabled an amendment that would require domestic power producers to sell 90% of their output to Slovenian consumers at just above production price. This idea was dismissed by the coalition as a violation of EU free market rules.\n\n(Sebastijan R. Maček | sta.si)",
    "Slovenia to scrap Boxer deal, seek other armored vehicles": "WARSAW, Poland — The Slovenian Ministry of Defence has announced the country’s government will cancel a deal to purchase 45 Boxer armored vehicles with related equipment and services for a total of €343.4 million ($343 million) from the intergovernmental Organization for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR).\n\nLjubljana instead intends to seek other options to acquire eight-wheel-drive vehicles for its land forces, according to officials.\n\n“By the end of the year, the ministry will prepare a solution to develop the capabilities of a medium battalion battle group and a medium combat reconnaissance battalion,” the ministry said in a statement.\n\nThe latest decision is based on the findings of an internal audit commissioned by Defense Minister Marjan Šarec last June after a new government took over power in Ljubljana.\n\n“There is a trend to buy off-the-shelf vehicles, when you buy a vehicle, you put it on the road and drive it. You don’t buy a vehicle and have to buy this and that,” the minister told local broadcaster RTV Slovenija.\n\nŠarec was referring to the Boxer’s selected specification which did not include all of the equipment required by the ministry in the vehicle’s tag price, according to the internal audit’s findings.\n\nIf Slovenia were to proceed with the purchase of 45 Boxers, the ministry would be forced to buy at least 24 more armored vehicles to ensure sufficient capacities for a medium battalion battle group, the defense minister said.\n\nSlovenia’s 2020 defense white paper states that, under the country’s commitments to NATO, the first battalion battle group is to be established by 2027, and the second one by 2030.\n\nMeanwhile, the ministry’s decision has been criticized by Matej Tonin, Šarec’s predecessor and currently an opposition lawmaker.

    "Slovenia's Ljubljana Airport Gears Up For A Busy Winter": "Slovenians will have more options to escape the cold this winter, with various carriers adding extra services from Ljubljana Airport.\n\nSlovenia's main airport in Ljubljana will get a boost this winter, with various airlines planning on increasing services to the country's capital city. Airlines across Europe and the Middle East have reaffirmed their commitment to the airport with recent schedule announcements.\n\nThis is good news for the airport and commercial aviation in Slovenia, which has been in the doldrums since the demise of Adria Airways three years ago. Adding to the burden has been the pandemic, and with no domestically-based airline, Slovenia was described as Europe's worst performing aviation market. Last winter, there were days without a single flight in or out of Slovenia, and by July 2021, the country had less than 9% of its July 2019 traffic.\n\nSix airlines are boosting winter flights\n\nFrom that low point, it's easy to see why these increased commitments for Winter 2022/23 are so important for the community and the airport. Exyuaviation.com reported that six airlines, Turkish Airlines, SWISS, Brussels Airlines, Air Serbia, Air Cairo and flydubai, are planning to increase services over winter.

The fence is currently about 200 kilometers long.\n\nSlovenia has announced plans to monitor the border with drones and cameras instead.\n\nWith AP",
    "Slovenia's economic growth to slow in Q3 - c-bank": "LJUBLJANA (Slovenia), September 9 (SeeNews) - Slovenia's economic growth is expected to slow down to 0.3% on a quarterly basis in the third quarter of 2022 following a 0.9% expansion in April-June, due to the continuing Russian war on Ukraine and the resulting international sanctions, Slovenia's central bank said.\n\n\"A slowdown is suggested in particular by the economic sentiment indicator, which remained negative in August, where the most notable factors were consumer reluctance to make major purchases and a decline in the assessment of order books in manufacturing,\" the central bank said in a statement earlier this week.\n\nIt also noted that employment remains at record-high levels and firms are largely hiring foreign workers, while wage growth remains moderate.\n\n\"High growth in exports of travel services has seen the deterioration in the current account balance come to an end in recent months. Nominal growth in merchandise exports remained high, with positive developments in all the main categories. Developments on the import side were even stronger, most notably merchandise imports from Russia, which in June were ten times higher than the monthly average over the 20 years before the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, as a result of surging energy prices,\" the central bank said.\n\nThe consolidated general government deficit over the first seven months of the year was down significantly in year-on-year terms at 300 million euro ($303 million), as revenues recorded high growth and expenditure declined as payments related to the pandemic fell.\n\nThe main risks over the following months and next year are a deterioration in the economic situation and potential new measures for mitigating the impact of the energy crisis, according to the central bank.\n\nSlovenia's economic output rose by a real 8.2% year-on-year and by 0.9% quarter-on-quarter in the April-June period of 2022, according to data from the country's statistical office.\n\n($ = 0.989814 euro)",

    "Record expenditure planned in Slovenia’s revised budget": "The Slovenian government has adopted a revised budget for 2022 as it increased revenue by about a billion euros to €12.54 billion and expenditure by around €600 million to a record €14.6 billion.\n\nDespite the higher outlays, the budget deficit is now budgeted at 3.6% of GDP, down from the initially projected 4.4%, as revenue remains robust due to high prices and the resulting tax windfall.\n\nFinance Minister Klemen Boštjančič said the revision was urgent since the budget in its current form, which was adopted last year, was untenable due to additional liabilities stemming from COVID-19 stimulus measures that the previous government had not appropriately budgeted.\n\nThe revision also responds to the unpredictable economic and fiscal circumstances created by the fallout from the war in Ukraine and includes additional spending to address the cost-of-living crisis. The ministries of health, finance, and labour account for the bulk of the spending increase.\n\nThe supplementary budget comes amidst criticism by the Fiscal Council, which monitors compliance with the fiscal rule and recently said that the revenue windfall should be used to pay down debt instead of financing spending.\n\nIt also said the adjustments could be made with a reallocation of appropriations, as it warned that the revision was a continuation of the practice over the past two years “when budget planning in times of extraordinary circumstances was not transparent or credible.”",

The details and strategy for these investments are set out in the Partnership Agreement between Slovenia and the Commission that was adopted today.\n\nThese EU funds will address the regional disparities in the country by boosting innovation and competitiveness, enabling the economy's digital transformation, investing in social inclusion, skills training and employment, and helping reach the country's climate and biodiversity goals.\n\nFighting climate change and supporting the green economy\n\nSlovenia will invest €806 million under the European Regional and Development Fund (ERDF) the Cohesion Fund for a greener, low-carbon transition towards a net zero carbon and resilient economy. The funds will contribute to the decarbonisation of the country as well as to the development of renewable energies. In particular, investments will be made in solar and wind energy capacities, and to improve the energy efficiency of buildings.\n\nEU funds will also mitigate climate change risks, promote circular economy in businesses, ensure an efficient management of water resources, and protect ecosystems and biodiversity.\n\n€249 million from the Just Transition Fund (JTF) will promote a just energy transition by helping the Savinjsko-Šaleška region shift away from coal by 2033, and the restructuring of the Zasavje region. The JTF will focus in particular on strengthening training and employment opportunities, contributing to the diversification and resilience of the local economy and reviving degraded areas.\n\nBoosting economic competitiveness and reducing regional disparities\n\n€727 million under the ERDF will be invested in research and innovation for the business sector, creating favourable conditions for businesses and promoting the digital transformation of the economy.\n\nOver €511 million under the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund will support sustainable and smart mobility and address the shortcomings of the public passenger transport, in particular by modernising and upgrading the Slovenian rail network.\n\nSocial inclusion, employment, education, and training\n\n€769 million from the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) and the ERDF will help tackle the challenges of long-term unemployment and of an ageing population by investing in upskilling and lifelong learning, and improving the working environment and conditions of older workers by training employers and adapting workplaces.\n\nFor an active and healthy ageing, Slovenia will use some of its ESF+ funds to invest heavily in its long-term care system. Community living will be supported by investments in social and community services, recruitment of new staff and training and modern educational programmes. Slovenia will equally invest in healthcare and mental health services which are critical for the well-being of society.\n\nMoney from the ESF+ will also help reduce social exclusion and the risk of poverty for vulnerable groups.

I am glad that a significant part of the funds will be invested in the development of the digital economy and in fighting climate change, thus improving living standards and leaving no one behind.”\n\nCommissioner for Jobs and Social Rights, Nicolas Schmit, added: “I welcome Slovenia's objective to invest in long term care and healthcare. Last week the Commission presented its European Care Strategy which underlines the importance of overhauling our care systems, to ensure they are accessible, affordable and of good quality. It is also very encouraging that Slovenia will continue to focus on boosting employment, lifelong learning and reducing poverty, which reflect the three main goals of the European Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan.”\n\nCommissioner for Environment, Oceans and Fisheries, Virginijus Sinkevičius, said: “Europe's blue economy creates tangible opportunities for coastal communities and plays a crucial role in decarbonising our economy.

    "New city, new problems: Slovenia arrives in Berlin much later than expected": "Slovenia arrived approximately 10 hours later in Berlin than expected. Then, a misunderstanding at the training facility caused the players to change outside.\n\nCredit: FIBA\n\nThe Slovenian national team famously had to take taxis to their first game in EuroBasket 2022 group stage in Cologne against Lithuania as the designated team bus did not arrive. With the playoffs teams situated in Berlin now, the issues are not leaving the reigning champions of Europe.\n\nFirst, the difficulties started before even arriving in Berlin. The organizers had scheduled a charter flight for Slovenia at 9 in the morning on Thursday. The national team decided that it was too early for the players in order to preserve their sleep and rest, and optioned not to take the flight.\n\nInstead, Slovenia hoped to take a high-speed train to the capital of Germany at 3 in the afternoon. However, it was not that easy. The entire train management system of Cologne Central train station malfunctioned due to heavy rain the day before, meaning that no trains could arrive at the station.\n\nAs experienced by our BasketNews journalist team as well, many basketball fans and journalists alike had to scramble for additional options to travel to Berlin.\n\nEventually, Slovenia took a plane from Cologne to Berlin and arrived approximately at 8 in the evening.\n\nHilariously, the issues did not stop there. When the team had to hold a training session yesterday, there was an unfortunate misunderstanding at the training facility.\n\nDuring the tournament, each team gets assigned an attaché who leads the team through various tournament facilities and helps the players and the coaching staff get around in the city. However, Slovenia's attaché did not know where the locker rooms in the training facility were or at least did not guide the team there, and the players had to change outside while watching France's practice at the same time.\n\nTeams can watch other teams' practices through multiple windows outside, and there's nothing stopping them.\n\nAfter all the issues, Slovenia faces Belgium today in the Round of 16. The game is scheduled at 14:45 CET.",

    "From Ancient Artefacts to Slovenian Truffles: Revealing Secrets Using Nuclear Techniques": "X-ray fluorescence (XRF) was one of several nuclear analytical techniques discussed today by participants of the event ‘Revealing Secrets Using Nuclear Techniques,’ held during IAEA’s 66th General Conference, to showcase the potential of nuclear techniques in uncovering secrets of both the past and the present.\n\nAttendees also heard about the applicability of NDT in various domains, from investigating the composition and origin of historical objects to revealing fraud and verifying the authenticity of paintings, food and timber.\n\nIn the field of cultural heritage, non-destructive testing techniques, allow researchers to assess the integrity and physical properties of objects without damaging them, in contrast to traditional chemical analytical methods, which has proved valuable to restorers when dealing with historical artefacts and other valuable or fragile pieces.\n\n\"Cultural heritage objects contain within their building blocks information that can only be unravelled by scientific analysis and examination,\" said Matthew Grima, forensic scientist and manager at the Heritage Malta's Diagnostic Science Laboratories. \"It is thus fantastic to be able to apply them also in a non-destructive way, sourcing the information without damaging the object.\"\n\nAt the event, attendees learned that accelerator-based techniques, like ion beam analysis (IBA) can be applied to determine the composition of cultural artefacts, such as paintings. For instance, it is possible to get analytical information from the sub-surface of a painting, in addition to the X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy data provide analytical information from the surface. The combination of these techniques revealed that the sfumato technique, a fine shading artistic technique perfected by Leonardo da Vinci, was used to produce a soft transition between colours and tones to achieve a realistic impression in several renaissance paintings, including the Mona Lisa.\n\n“This example shows that accelerator and portable systems are complementary nuclear based-techniques for NDT of paintings and more generally for cultural heritage materials,” said Lucile Beck, researcher in cultural heritage at the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA).",

    "Italy dominate Slovenia on their way to the final": "“It’s incredible,” setter and captain Simone Giannelli reacted. “I honestly didn’t think it was possible for us to win this match 3-0 because Slovenia are a very strong team and I respect them a lot. I’m very happy about this result and for our group. We are a young team and I think we have a lot of good things coming in the future. But we have a final in front of us now and we have to focus on the present. It will be a difficult match for us but we’ll try to do our best and battle them.”",

    "Slovenia’s DSO to install 50 e-chargers for EVs": "Elektro Ljubljana, one of the five power distribution companies in Slovenia that perform the duties of the distribution system operator, will install another 50 chargers for electric cars by the end of the year.\n\nElektro Ljubljana has 440 chargers at 200 locations. The company claims it operates the largest network in Slovenia. The country has a total of 821 e-chargers in 296 locations.\n\nPresident of the Board of Elektro Ljubljana Aleksander Zupančič said the basis for serious development of e-mobility is in a wide placement of e-chargers with an installed capacity of up to 22 kilowatts.\n\nA dense network of EV chargers enables charging at every stop, which reduces the load on the distribution grid and opens up the possibility of grid load management, added Zupančič.\n\nThe number of refills increased from 209 to 102,555\n\nElektro Ljubljana installed the first e-charger in 2011, and the growth in their use is enormous. In 2011, they had 209 refills, and ten years later – 102,555. In 2011, 71 kWh of electricity was consumed, and last year 1.4 million kWh.\n\nThe price of 1 kWh ranges from EUR 0.25 to EUR 0.35.\n\nZupančič pointed out that consumers are most interested in the locations of e-chargers, and the price and quality of the service.\n\nElektro Ljubljana is one of the five companies that manage the distribution network in Slovenia. SODO has the role of the distribution system operator (DSO), but the five power distribution companies own the infrastructure, so SODO has contracts with them to carry out the tasks of the DSO.\n\nThe remaining distribution companies are Elektro Celje, Elektro Gorenjska, Elektro Maribor and Elektro Primorska.",
    "Slovenia maps locations with grid capacity for utility-scale solar power plants": "Slovenia’s power utilities ELES and SODO have completed the assessments of the grid potential and the locations for connecting solar power plants of over 10 MW to the transmission grid, and units with a capacity above 5 MW to the distribution network. It is technically possible to add 1,826 MW in total.\n\nThe review of the capacity of Slovenia’s grid to include utility-scale solar power plants is primarily intended for investors, and it represents a tool to achieve the government’s goal to add 1 GW of solar by 2025. It is also a part of the cabinet’s wider push to increase the use of renewables.\n\nThe 1 GW solar target was set by Prime Minister Robert Golob in July as one of the priorities. Now the Ministry of Infrastructure, which is responsible for the energy sector, has published an assessment that it produced with transmission system operator (TSO) ELES, and distribution system operator (DSO) SODO.\n\nThere are currently at least 58 locations where it is possible to set up solar power plants with a capacity higher than 10 MW\n\nThe government instructed Minister Bojan Kumer on September 14 to prepare a plan to increase the capacity for electricity production from solar energy by 1,000 MW by 2025 in suitable locations, in cooperation with ELES and SODO, the ministry said.\n\nThe review shows there are currently at least 58 locations on the territory of Slovenia where it is possible to set up utility-scale solar power plants with a capacity higher than 10 MW, and connect them to the transmission grid.\n\nThe potential is similar in all five power distribution companies\n\nELES estimated the total technical potential for connecting solar power plants at 1.031 MW, the statement adds\n\nThe greatest potential was recorded in the regions of Drava, Sava, Central Slovenia and Mura.\n\nThe estimated potential for the integration of photovoltaic facilities into the low-voltage network is 795 MW. All five power distribution companies would have an almost equal share, according to SODO.\n\nThe ministry has prepared several draft laws to speed up investments in renewables, and published them for public review. It has also launched a proposal for the long-term plan for achieving the goals of promoting the production and use of renewables over the next five years.",
    "Slovenia to subject heating oil to price regulation": "Heating oil will be subject to price regulation from 13 September under a decree that the government adopted to mitigate the cost-of-living crisis ahead of the heating season.\n\nThe margin for retailers will be capped at 8 cents per litre, the government decided on Friday.\n\nThe underlying price will be calculated according to a formula based on the euro-dollar exchange rate and the price of heating oil on Mediterranean markets.\n\nPrice regulation will be coupled with a temporary lifting of the CO2 levy not just for heating oil but also for diesel, petrol and natural gas, the prices of which are already regulated.\n\nHeating oil costs between €1.46 and €1.54 per litre from the largest providers. Finance, a business newspaper, estimates the price will drop by roughly ten cents when price regulation kicks in.\n\nThe move comes as a surprise since Prime Minister Robert Golob said just days before the regulation was adopted that full price regulation would be eschewed for the time being and only a margin ceiling put in place.",

    "Next to Nice: A tale of two Slovenian cryptocurrency sponsorships": "A handful of times a year, the pro road cyclists of the world compete in their national kits rather than their trade team ones. In the case of Slovenia’s Tadej ‘Tufts’ Pogačar, that means that for the duration of his time in Wollongong he’s swapped the white, black and red of UAE Team Emirates for a lime green Slovenian kit.\n\nAlthough the riders aren’t repping their usual sponsors, that doesn’t mean their Worlds kits are a sponsor-free zone. National federations often have their own crop of backers, and in the case of Slovenia – in pride of place across their riders’ chests and backsides – is the name ‘NiceHash’, a cryptocurrency platform which is officially headquartered in the British Virgin Islands but in practical terms based in Slovenia.\n\nIf a Slovenian crypto sponsor is ringing some bells for you, it’s probably because of an ill-fated WorldTour sponsorship from the second half of the 2022 season. Do not fear: that was NextHash, and this is NiceHash.\n\nBut the two are connected.\n\nTadej Pogačar of Slovenia pops a wheelie at the men’s elite road race start. (Photo by Tim de Waele/Getty Images)\n\nAs CyclingTips reported earlier this year, NextHash founder Ana Benčič was at one point a 35% shareholder in the soundalike, NiceHash. The latter company was facing ruin after having US$80 million of bitcoin stolen by a team of North Korean military hackers – just the tip of the crazy iceberg that is that story – and they accepted Benčič’s offer of investment to help right the ship.\n\nWhen it became clear that Benčič did not actually have the investment lined up, NiceHash sued her and her affiliates leading to their removal from the company. Benčič had caught the crypto bug, however, and went on to establish the similarly-named NextHash soon after. “Even the choice of name for her company is a bit funny to say the least, and her published materials are very similar to NiceHash,” NiceHash CMO Joe Downie told CyclingTips. “We just hope people do not confuse us [for NextHash], as we are running a profoundly different kind of business.”\n\nSlovenia is a small country with disproportionate clout in the cryptocurrency sector, so despite NextHash’s unfortunate legacy in the sport, NiceHash was not put off. The company signed up as a major sponsor of the Slovenian Cycling Federation earlier this year, placing their brand name prominently across all disciplines of the sport for an initial term of one year. “We have been a smaller sponsor of Slovenian cycling events for a few years, and this opportunity was the next logical step,” Downie told CyclingTips.\n\nThe sponsorship involves the jersey placements, banners and flags on race routes, and “video time with Roglič and Pogačar for a few media campaigns.”\n\n“The goals are mutually beneficial, since we are promoting both some of Slovenia’s best athletes (on their side) and one of the biggest Slovenian crypto companies (on our side), and to show that crypto is no longer in the shadows, but receives legitimate, mainstream attention and is beneficial to everyone,” Downie said.\n\nPogačar takes a break during training. Photo: Slovenian Cycling Federation Facebook\n\nWhile NiceHash’s partnership with the Slovenian Cycling Federation appears to be going off without a hitch, NextHash’s legacy in the sport is far more mixed. The Team Qhubeka-NextHash team it sponsored folded at the end of 2021, with team boss Doug Ryder currently working on a return to the upper divisions of the sport. Of NextHash’s missing sponsorship payments, Ryder told CyclingTips today that “we are trying to resolve things and have had contact.”\n\nRecent reports in Slovenian media indicate that Benčič has been charged with misuse of company funds, and could face up to eight years’ jail time.\n\nSo, as you watch the men’s World Championships road race and see Tadej Pogačar animating things with a crypto brand splashed across his kit – remember, that’s NiceHash, not NextHash. For the sake of all involved, hopefully this one works out.",

    "Celebrating the Day of Slovenian Sport together": "The main event honouring the national holiday will take place at Congress Square in Ljubljana. This is also the start of the European Week of Sport launched by the European Commission and lasting from 23 to 30 September.\n\nSlovenians are second in the world in terms of Olympic medals won per capita, and winners of numerous medals at world championships. Top athletic achievements, outstanding natural features, highly developed infrastructure and physical education in primary and secondary schools are just some of the factors that contribute to our lifelong connection to sport and motivate us to devote a large part of our free time to sport and recreational activities. We are a sporting nation, as evidenced by school playgrounds full of young people, packed mountain huts and lodges, and sports enthusiasts of all generations in sports halls and fitness centres. Six out of ten Slovenians do more than two and a half hours of recreational sport activities a week, and four out of ten spend more than five hours a week doing sport.\n\nThe fact that sport is in our nature has been recognised by the state; on 18 June 2020, following the initiative of the Olympic Committee of Slovenia – Association of Sports Federations (OKS–AF), it declared 23 September the Day of Slovenian Sport.\n\nMore about the Day of Slovenian Sport you can read here.\n\nSource: slovenia.si",
    "15th regular session of the Government of the Republic of Slovenia": "Dearness allowance for families entitled to child benefit\n\nThe Government adopted the draft act on temporary measures to mitigate the consequences of price increases for the beneficiaries of child benefit, on the basis of which families with children, who are entitled to child benefit, will be receiving dearness allowance for three months. The purpose of the measure is to improve the social security of families with children, as one of the most vulnerable groups of citizens, whose material situation has been worsening due to the general price increases.\n\nThe beneficiaries will not be obliged to file applications for the receipt of dearness allowance. The fulfilment of the conditions will be examined on the basis of a valid decision on child benefit in the period from 1 October 2022 to 31 January 2023. The dearness allowance will be paid out three times, i. e. in November 2022, December 2022, and January 2023 in the amount of child benefit for the first child in an individual income bracket, in which the beneficiary has been classified, for each child. The dearness allowance will not be included in income when exercising the rights as per the act governing the rights from public funds, and it will also not be subject to income tax.\n\nThe financial consequences of the measure will amount to EUR 63 million. The Government will submit the draft act to be discussed by the National Assembly as per the urgent procedure.\n\nThe Autumn Economic Forecast\n\nThe Autumn forecast of economic trends 2022, which was prepared by the Office of Macroeconomic Analysis and Development (UMAR) and which was presented to the government at today's meeting, foresees slightly higher growth for this year than in the spring forecast, mainly due to favorable trends in the first half of the year. By the end of the year and in the first half of 2023, the growth of economic activity is expected to moderate.\n\nThe Government asks the Fiscal Council to provide an assessment of the existence of exceptional circumstances\n\nThe Government asked the Fiscal Council of the Republic of Slovenia to assess the existence of exceptional circumstances in 2023.\n\nThe Fiscal Council gave its assessment of the existence of exceptional circumstances for 2021 and 2022. Prior to drafting the Ordinance amending the Ordinance on the framework for the preparation of the general government budget for the 2022–2024 period in the section referring to 2023 and 2024, the draft amending the state budget for 2023 and the draft state budget for 2024, the Government again asked the Fiscal Council to prepare an assessment of the existence of exceptional circumstances in 2023.\n\nIn its request, the Government referred to the communications of the European Commission regarding the 2022 European Semester Spring Package, in which the Commission acknowledged that the European economy had already attained robust economic growth following the crisis caused by the COVID-19 epidemic, but the anticipated recovery was slowed down by the consequences of the war in Ukraine. In the light of uncertainties which, primarily no longer arise from the COVID-19 epidemic, but the war in Ukraine, inflationary pressures and disturbances in global supply chains, the Commission assessed that the European Union had not yet emerged from the so-called risk of a severe economic downturn. On this basis, it confirmed further activation of the general escape clause in 2023, which will enable continued temporary derogation from the fiscal rules of the European Union.\n\nThe situation and uncertainties due to the energy crisis, inflation and the war in Ukraine have further escalated since the aforementioned communication of the European Commission. The countries of the European Union are intensively seeking alternative sources and simultaneously adopting significant measures to help households and companies alleviate the impact of price increases.\n\nThe fact is that the situation has changed to such an extent that fiscal objectives will have to be adjusted several times. It is also certain that a medium-term fiscal strategy for attaining medium-term balance of public finances will have to be drafted after the cessation of exceptional circumstances, as stipulated by the Fiscal Rule Act. At that time, it will be necessary to set new objectives when preparing general government budgets and prepare a programme of measures for their attainment. It will not be possible to ensure the observance of the medium-term balance without preparing a multi-annual programme for the elimination of derogations and without endangering the recovery attained after the crisis.",

    "Doncic pours in 35 to pace Slovenia to 88-72 triumph over Belgium": "The Belgium Lions saw themselves in prime position to pull off a major upset. But Luka Doncic and Slovenia had other ideas.\n\nLed by 35 points, five rebounds and five assists from Doncic, Slovenia went on a late 19-1 run en route to holding off Belgium and upending the pesky Lions, 88-72, Saturday in Berlin in the knockout round of the EuroBasket tournament. With the win, Slovenia advances to the quarterfinals of this prestigious tournament.\n\nUkraine will play Poland on Sunday, and that winner will face Slovenia on Wednesday.\n\nOther than Doncic, Slovenia got 13 points from Klemen Prepelic, 12 points and six rebounds from Mike Tobey, and 11 points and two steals from Goran Dragic. Doncic was 11-of-25 from the field — 4-of-10 from beyond the three-point arc – and 9-of-10 from the charity stripe in delivering yet another impressive performance.\n\nThe Lions were led by Emmanuel Lecomte (16 points) and Pierre-Antoine Gillet (15 points, 10 boards).\n\nThe scrappy Belgium squad took its only lead of the day at 64-63 with 9:09 remaining in the game, capping a brisk 14-6 run. But that seemed to anger Doncic and Slovenia, who quickly took control of the game and kept alive their chances of repeating as EuroBasket champions.\n\n“Belgium was playing great basketball,” Doncic said. “We knew it was going to be a hard game.\n\n“They were fighting until the end, but in the end I think we played a little better.”\n\nDoncic scored five straight points that put Slovenia ahead, 68-65, including on a nifty spin move in the paint and a free throw after he was fouled on the play. Shortly thereafter, the Dallas Mavericks’ superstar point guard fed Prepelic for a three-pointer and a 73-65 lead.\n\nLater on, three free throws from Prepelic and a pair of charity tosses from Doncic padded Slovenia’s lead to 80-65. And a lob-dunk by Tobey put the finishing touches on that massive 19-1 run as Slovenia built an insurmountable 82-65 lead with just 4:02 left in the game.\n\nDoncic entered this contest after scoring 36 points last Tuesday against Germany and a whopping 47 points last Wednesday against France. He now is the first player in the last 30 years to score at least 30 points in three consecutive EuroBasket games as he continues to make a strong case of being the best basketball player in the world.\n\nSlovenia jumped out to a 16-5 lead with 5:50 left in the first quarter on the strength on some serious long-distance shot-making by Doncic. Roaming around the perimeter and showing off his skills from behind the three-point line, Doncic drained his first three three-pointers less than four minutes into the game as Slovenia got a quick grip on this game.\n\nTobey added a pair of free throws and a dunk as Slovenia immediately took control of the game while letting Belgium know they were going to be in for a long day. Tobey was back in the lineup after missing the game against France with a sprained ankle which occurred on the opening jump ball of the contest against Germany when he inadvertently stepped on the foot of one of the referees.\n\nThe Lions remained within striking distance of Slovenia and only trailed, 24-19, after a first quarter that saw Doncic tally 11 points. With Doncic on the bench, Slovenia negotiated a 8-0 run and bolted ahead, 37-27, with 4:33 to go before halftime.\n\nBut Belgium wouldn’t go away as they crawled to within 44-41 of Slovenia at intermission.\n\n“Every time we made a run, they came back – mostly because of our mistakes,” Slovenia coach Aleksander Sekelic said. “We have to give credit to them. Also, they shot the ball well.\n\n“I think in the second half we made some adjustments, especially the defense was much better and also they missed some open shots. So it gave us the boost and the lead to finish the game peacefully.”\n\nDoncic came out of the halftime dressing room intent on getting some separation between Slovenia and Belgium. Showing why he’s one of the leading candidates to win the Most Valuable Player award in the upcoming NBA season, Doncic opened the third quarter with a steal and an uncontested fast break layup.\n\nDoncic then powered his way inside for a basket, drained a couple of free throws, bullied his way near the rim for another basket, showed off his defensive prowess by taking a charge, and added a free throw to complete a personal 7-0 run which put Slovenia out front, 56-50, with 3:17 remaining in the third quarter. After Belgium narrowed the deficit to one point, Doncic scored again as Slovenia took a 63-60 lead into the fourth quarter when the contest got completely out of hand thanks to that game-changing 19-1 run.\n\n“We had a great run in the fourth and congrats to Belgium on the game they did,” Doncic said. “They were fighting great but you know it was a hard game and we won.”\n\nTwitter: @DwainPrice",

    "Western Balkans leaders in Slovenia call to speed up EU enlargement": "The heads of state of Western Balkans countries called for an acceleration of the EU enlargement process at a meeting in Slovenia on Monday as they urged the EU to grant Bosnia and Herzegovina candidate country status and introduce visa-free travel for all countries in the region by the end of the year.\n\nIn conclusions issued after the summit, they also stressed that EU enlargement to the Western Balkans was vital for the region’s stability. “Now more than ever, this has become a geopolitical issue,” said Slovenian President Borut Pahor, who co-hosted the meeting with Croatian President Zoran Milanović.\n\nThey also called on the EU to help countries in the region cope with the fallout from the energy crisis.\n\nThe meeting featured Albanian President Bajram Begaj, Bosnia and Herzegovina’s presiding trio Željko Komšić, Milorad Dodik and Džaferović, Montenegro’s President Milo Đukanović, Kosovo’s Vjosa Osmani, North Macedonia’s Stevo Pendarovski and Serbia’s Aleksandar Vučić.\n\nThe conclusions were in lieu of a final statement. Pahor said that the idea of a final declaration had been given up during preparations for the summit when it became clear consensus could not be reached.\n\nThe reason for this was the refusal of the Croatian and Bosniak members of the Bosnia-Herzegovina presidency to accept the mention of all three nations of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which Croatia had desired.\n\nMilanović said that “some in Bosnia are bothered by the very mention of the term constituent nations.”\n\nAcknowledging that the disagreement stemmed from Bosnia-Herzegovina’s current internal disputes about election reform, Džaferović said that electoral legislation was an internal matter of his country and that the Brdo-Brijuni Process was not a forum dedicated to Bosnia’s internal affairs.\n\nVucić said the conclusions were passed without Croatia’s position on the importance of “legitimate representation of constituent nations at all levels of governance in Bosnia and Herzegovina,” which Serbia would have supported because it was in conformity with the Dayton accords.\n\n“We have displayed many differences and opposed views, but it was a civilised and rational conversation,” the Serbian president said, adding that the atmosphere at the conference was better than last year, even though the situation in the region was not.\n\nBoth Pahor and Milanović framed the meeting as a success. Milanović said the conclusions were “the lowest common denominator,” while Pahor said the discussion was “constructive and civilised; we focused on what unites us and not on what divides us, even though there was a lot of that as well.” (Sebastijan R.
