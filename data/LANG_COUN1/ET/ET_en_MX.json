    "U.S. farmers urge Washington to challenge Mexico's looming ban on GM corn": "A trailer truck is loaded with yellow corn imported from Brazil at a warehouse in the port of Tuxpan, in Veracruz state, Mexico September 23, 2022. REUTERS/Yahir Ceballos\n\nMEXICO CITY, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Farmers in the United States are urging their government to challenge a looming Mexican ban on genetically modified (GM) corn under a regional free trade agreement, warning of billions of dollars of economic damage to both countries.\n\nA late 2020 decree by Mexico President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador would phase out GM corn and the herbicide glyphosate by 2024. Supporters of the ban say GM seeds can contaminate Mexico's age-old native varieties, and point to research showing adverse effects of glyphosate.\n\nMexico prides itself as the birthplace of modern corn but it imports about 17 million tonnes of U.S. corn a year and is on track to import even more this year, experts said.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nSome in Mexico's government, including Agriculture Minister Victor Villalobos, have signaled that yellow corn imports for livestock feed will not be disrupted. U.S. farmers remain wary since no official document states that, according to a U.S. agriculture official familiar with recent meetings with Mexican officials.\n\nAlso, Lopez Obrador this month said firmly: \"We do not accept GMO corn.\"\n\nCorn for human consumption, including white corn used in food products like tortillas, accounts for between 18% and 20% of Mexico's total U.S. corn imports. There are still questions about whether such GM imports will be eliminated by 2024.\n\nMexico's health regulator COFEPRIS has not authorized new strains of glyphosate-resistant GM corn seeds for import since 2018. The National Corn Growers Association, representing U.S. farmers, wants the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) to launch a dispute settlement proceeding under the USMCA trade pact, which includes Canada and Mexico.\n\nAngus R. Kelly, the association's director of public policy, trade and biotechnology, said it objects to the \"precedent-setting nature of the decrees\" and to Mexico rejecting biotech crop traits \"without any scientific basis.\"\n\nWashington could potentially raise a dispute under the agriculture chapter of the USMCA stipulating cooperation between members on an individual government's regulation of imports, according to Raul Urteaga, a former Mexican government official and founder of consulting group Global Agrotrade Advisors.\n\nA dispute settlement can apply under some USMCA chapters when a country considers one member government has nullified or impaired a benefit that was in place when the pact was signed.\n\nMexico's agriculture ministry and the U.S. embassy in Mexico declined to comment. The USTR and the USDA did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nBiotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO), representing biotech companies including Bayer, said it \"supported the (U.S.) administration taking enforcement action on Mexico’s treatment of agricultural biotechnology\" if dialogue fails.\n\nFederico Zerboni, Argentina-based president of agriculture chamber MAIZALL which sent a delegation to Mexico in August, said denial of new GM seeds made it seem like Mexico's regulator favors a \"very old and unfeasible production system to feed the world.\"\n\nCOFEPRIS, in a statement to Reuters said its decisions were based on \"scientific evidence and risk assessments.\"\n\nIn 2020, Bayer agreed to pay billions of dollars to settle lawsuits by people who claimed they were harmed by its weedkiller.\n\nA March report by the U.S. consulting firm World Perspectives Inc projected that Mexico's ban could cost the country $4.4 billion over 10 years for corn imports, push the price of tortillas up 42% by the second year and cause major risks to food security.\n\nThe United States could see a $16.5 billion drop in economic output over 10 years, the report found.

    "At UN, Mexico proposes a high-level diplomatic delegation to mediate between Russia and Ukraine": "The proposed caucus would include Pope Francis, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Secretary General Antonio Guterres.\n\nSuch a caucus was necessary Mr. Ebrard explained, because the war in Ukraine had triggered a cascade of global consequences, including food and fuel shortages, disruptions in the world economy, polarized the multilateral system and led to a climate of mistrust and international uncertainty.\n\n“Just when it seemed like the recovery from the pandemic was on the horizon, we saw the war in Ukraine with the risk of a nuclear incident and catastrophic potential consequences,” he said.\n\nThe Mexican Foreign Minister underlined the paralysis of the UN Security Council the face of the conflict, highlighting its inaction to put a stop to armed aggression by one of its own members and to direct a diplomatic process in search of a peaceful and negotiated solution.\n\nFurther, he noted that the Security Council has not been able to guarantee necessary humanitarian assistance, nor has it been able to fully support the work of the Secretary General and other actors to manage access to grains and fertilizers produced by the Russian Federation and Ukraine.\n\nProposal to mediate conflict\n\n“For these reasons, the President of Mexico, proposes that a delegation or caucus of Heads of State and Government, that would encourage and accompany the efforts by the Secretary General to promote peaceful and trust-building measures between the Russian Federation and Ukraine. This will allow us to make use of a peaceful resolution mechanism that would be within the framework of the UN Charter”, he stated.\n\nForeign Minister Ebrard explained that the intention is to create a diplomatic channel that complements those that already exist to interact with the parties in conflict, reduce tensions and channel mediation.\n\nMexico has already presented its proposal to the parties involved and will continue to make the necessary consultations “with the sole purpose of being able to contribute, as an impartial actor in good faith” and to generate greatest support for the efforts and good offices of the Secretary General and the Caucus. In this regard, Mr Ebrard said: “We hope that the creation of this caucus will have the support of the UN’s Member States.”\n\nAbuse of veto\n\nMr. Ebrard attributed the paralysis of the Security Council to the abuse of the so-called right to veto by some of its permanent members. He recalled that his country, together with France, has proposed an initiative that asks the permanent members to refrain from resorting to the veto in situations of mass atrocities. The proposal has so far received the support of 106 States.\n\nIn addition, Mexico and 83 other States promoted an accountability mechanism by which the General Assembly is urged to hold an emergency session every time a veto is registered in the Security Council and to invite the authors of that veto to explain their position.\n\n“We must now make a decision about whether or not we want to take further steps to prevent this system from suffering greater paralysis in the face of mass suffering of people,” he said.\n\nRestoring trust\n\nTo conclude, Foreign Minister Ebrard stressed that the door to political dialogue and diplomatic negotiation cannot be closed. “Current international tensions are not going to be resolved by force. We must ensure political understanding and trust-building mechanisms. Yes, restoring trust is one of our biggest challenges,” he added.\n\nIn this regard, he expressed his country's conviction that the UN continues to be a unique tool of the international community for the peaceful resolution of conflicts and progress towards sustainable development.",

    "Mexico could turn gig workers into full-time employees": "In the coming days, the Mexican government is set to discuss an amendment to force delivery and ride-hailing apps to make gig workers into formal employees, which could affect the country’s estimated 350,000 to 500,000 delivery workers and ride-hailing drivers. Mexico’s labor department, known as the STPS, will introduce a proposal to Congress, aimed at reforming the federal labor law, which has the support of government-recognized gig worker unions and some independent workers’ organizations.\n\nBut some independent gig workers’ groups, who do not fit the union registration requirements or don’t want to be legally constituted as one, have been vocal in their opposition. They worry that the government is primarily interested in higher tax collection and increasing membership dues for the official unions, without dealing with workers’ real concerns.\n\nThe proposed law, as drafted by the labor department with the support of official unions, requires a set amount of working hours for employees, plus union membership fees if they wish to join one. “What we want are dignified working conditions for the workers on these platforms,” an STPS spokesperson told Rest of World.\n\nThe National Union of App Workers (UNTA) is one of the official unions that collaborated with the STPS on the proposal. Sergio Guerrero, a spokesperson for the UNTA, told Rest of World that the draft law has broad ambitions, but aims specifically for three things: full legal recognition of a working relationship between platforms and workers, full social security provisions to be given by the platforms, and payment according to the number of hours that each worker is logged into the app.\n\n“We have always pushed for a three-way collaboration, promoting conversations between the government, the workers, and the platforms,” Saúl Gómez Piña, a spokesperson for Ni Un Repartidor Menos — a grassroots delivery organization that walked out of the proposal’s drafting process with the unions and the government — told Rest of World. “But right now, the government is just organizing with some unions and plans to force the proposal onto the platforms. It shouldn’t be done like that.”\n\nFor already unprofitable companies like Uber, Didi, and Rappi, becoming full-time employers would go against existing business models built around independent contractors. Rest of World reached out to all three companies, but they declined to comment. According to Guerrero, these platforms are drafting their own counter-proposals to be considered by the Mexican congress when STPS’ proposal is introduced.\n\nProviding legal rights to gig workers poses a larger challenge for both the platforms and the workers — one that the government is fully aware of. “The great debate is who should pay for social security,” Norma Gabriela López Castañeda, incorporation and collection director of the Mexican Social Security Institute, had said in an interview in October 2021.\n\nMore than 70% of the Mexican population is affiliated with some social security program. A portion of the fees they pay to access benefits is paid for by the government, another by the employer, and yet another by the employee. Independent workers, meanwhile, can voluntarily be added to the system, but they must pay more to make up for their lack of an employer.\n\nBut, many gig workers have incentives to stay out of formal employment.\n\n“Plenty of delivery workers are immigrants, working mothers, or elderly. The proposed draft would outright exclude them from working on these platforms.”\n\n“We have plenty of delivery workers that are immigrants, working mothers, or elderly. The proposed draft would outright exclude them from working on these platforms,” Alfredo García Campos, a spokesperson for independent delivery-workers’ organization Unión de Repas, told Rest of World.\n\nJorge García de Presno, a Mexico City-based labor and employment lawyer from international law practice group Cuatrecasas, told Rest of World that there is a significant group of gig workers who are perfectly fine being classified as independent workers because they’re able to manage their own time.\n\nThat is the case of Gabriela Gómez, a single mother who earns part of her income on several delivery platforms and who is also a spokesperson for Unión de Repas. For her, the terms the STPS’ proposal is pushing for would not be of benefit. “Forcing us to work a set amount of hours, as the proposal is attempting, will complicate our lives,” she told Rest of World.\n\nUnión de Repas, which has almost 900 members — most of whom are from Mexico City and the neighboring State of Mexico — is just one of the multitude of organizations that have emerged to protect and vouch for delivery workers’ rights. According to a manifesto published by gig workers’ organizations in late August, there are more than 50 such organizations nationwide. Of those, only two have been recognized as unions by the government. One of them is the UNTA.\n\n“We have 500 affiliated members nationwide, and our goal is to grow large enough to collectively bargain for workers’ rights,” UNTA’s Guerrero told Rest of World. As a state-accredited union, if the draft passes into law, the UNTA would be able to sue the platforms if “there are any injustices in the application of the law,” he claimed, unlike independent groups such as Unión de Repas or Ni Un Repartidor Menos. But, for them, not being able to take platforms to court isn’t an issue.\n\n“Our priority is for workers to keep their working flexibility, meaning they’re able to be online when they want to, for as long as they want to, without working exclusively for one or another platform,” says Gómez Piña, from Ni Un Repartidor Menos.\n\nRather than pushing for social security, as the STPS is, alternative proposals by independent organizations prioritize other challenges faced by gig workers. Ni Un Repartidor Menos is particularly focused on road safety, while Unión de Repas is pushing for a work flexibility and gender-focused strategy to protect female, trans, and disabled workers.\n\n“The representatives of [government-recognized] unions work in an office and not on the streets,” Unión de Repas’ García claimed. “[It] is a sign that they’re just government pawns.” He said his organization would side with the apps if they legally challenged the amendments to the law in their current state. “We would take the streets, if necessary,” he concluded.",

    "The Unexpected Rise in Remittances to Central America and Mexico During the Pandemic": "The Unexpected Rise in Remittances to Central America and Mexico During the Pandemic\n\nRemittances hit record levels in 2021 driven by rising US wages and unemployment insurance relief\n\nRemittances—the money sent from citizens working abroad to families back home—are a crucial source of income in Central America, Panama, and the Dominican Republic (CAPDR) as well as Mexico. Despite an expected decline at the onset of the pandemic, remittances surprisingly increased in 2020, hitting record levels in 2021. IMF staff research explores why remittances from the US to CAPDR and Mexico remained resilient during the pandemic.\n\nAn unexpected comeback\n\nRemittances to CAPDR and Mexico are sent by immigrants working predominantly in the service-providing sectors of the US economy. Economists predicted that remittances to CAPDR and Mexico would decline by up to 20 percent, given the fall in US employment at the onset of the pandemic. They based this prediction on the data from traditional macroeconomic models that linked US labor market conditions with immigrants’ income. These models accurately predicted the deep but brief collapse in remittances that we observed in April 2020, but they failed to predict the strong comeback that followed.\n\nExplaining the surge\n\nBefore the pandemic, the number of remittance transactions—the volume effect—determined the level of remittances. The jump in remittances observed in the second half of 2020 was a result of an increase in both the number of transactions and the average amount remitted per transaction—the value effect.\n\nThe rise in the number of transactions—the volume effect—was most likely driven by an increase in the number of people sending remittances rather than new immigrants arriving in the US. As a result of the lockdowns, immigrants also adapted and switched to remitting digitally, rather than in person, increasing the number of transactions. More importantly, most of the increase in remittances was due to the value effect. Rising US wages drove the increase in the average amounts remitted. US government assistance, through unemployment insurance relief, also supported incomes and compensated for the loss of income, contributing to the increase. The “altruism” motive was very strong; as COVID-19 cases were increasing at home, immigrants in the US sent on average more money home.\n\nRemittances remained strong in 2021 due to the US labor market recovery and sustained growth in real wages. By the end of 2021, the service sectors where CAPDR and Mexican immigrants predominantly work recovered, recording increases in weekly earnings that were above the US average.\n\nA look ahead\n\nLooking forward, the growth in remittances to CAPDR and Mexico is expected to slow, as some of the extraordinary factors in 2020 and 2021 dissipate. However, over time remittances are expected to grow, as immigration to the US continues to rise and the average amount remitted grows in line with US wages. If employment and wages remain strong in the US, we should expect an increase in remittances during times of hardship in Central America and Mexico, as immigrants help families back home.\n\n****\n\nYorbol Yakhshilikov is an economist in the IMF Western Hemisphere Department.",

They also indirectly support the growth of ocean plants by controlling populations of sea creatures that feed on them.\n\nAccording to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), there are over 500 species of shark worldwide. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species states that over 143 of these species are in serious danger of extinction and are considered vulnerable to critically endangered.\n\nSeventy per cent of the shark population in Baja California is already gone according to Frida Lara, a scientific coordinator at Orgcas Irene Barajas\n\nThere are many reasons for the decline in the number of sharks. Their habitat is under increasing threat from pollution and climate change. Some are caught accidentally. Many are caught deliberately for their fins, which some countries consider a delicacy.\n\n\"Seventy per cent of the shark population in Baja California is already gone.

Longtime coach Ricardo Gareca was replaced after the side fell to Australia in a penalty shootout in a playoff for a Qatar World Cup berth in June.\n\nMexico, meanwhile, will open their World Cup campaign on November 22 against Poland in Group C, which also includes Argentina and Saudi Arabia.\n\nThey will continue their preparations on Tuesday when they play Colombia in Santa Clara, California, outside San Francisco.",
    "What Art Lovers Should See in Mexico City, One of the World’s Top Art Destinations": "To say Mexico City is a great place to experience art would be a substantial understatement. Not only has it produced one of the world’s most beloved painters, Frida Kahlo, but it has consistently stood at the forefront of various international art movements for more than a century.\n\nBut the city’s artistic standing — as well as that of Mexico in general — suffers from misapprehensions derived largely from the region’s rather notorious reputation. At best it’s often considered a destination that offers little more than beaches and booze and, at worst, it’s assumed to be too dangerous to visit, great art notwithstanding.\n\nHaving spent most of the the past six years living in Mexico City and the rest of the country, I can report that both assertions are inaccurate. While the country has undoubtedly suffered issues with crime, Mexico is safe for visitors, with Mexico City in particular undergoing rapid shifts in recent decades to become a safer and ever-more artistically vibrant city. The city overflows with an artistic abundance that stacks up against any other great art city of the world. To that end, here’s a selection of the city’s standout art experiences, from its most renowned museums to under-the-radar spots that only locals know to visit.",
    "Mexico: Will the EV Transition Pull Mexico’s Automotive Industry Out of Industrial ‘Long COVID’?: Parts and components have felt fine all along.": "M\n\nexico has been a growing leader in the automotive manufacturing industry for decades with companies from Japan, the U.S. and Germany frequently seeking out the low-cost yet highly capable workforce. In 2012 the country ranked as the 10th largest automotive producer in the world and in 2021 pushed out South Korea and claimed sixth place. But the Mexican National Institute of Statistics and Geography reported that in 2021 automotive production dropped by 20.25% across the country, and auto exports fell by 16.46%. The institute further reported that GM and Nissan were hit hard, with GM Mexico’s production falling by 43.7% in 2021, and Nissan Mexicana’s tumbling by 27.2%. Production halts occurred at three Nissan plants as raw materials and microchips became inaccessible.\n\nSupply chain disintegration, the semiconductor shortage and halts in production are all effects of an industrial “long COVID.” But even after a dismal 2021, this May Nissan announced plans to invest $700 million over the next three years in its Mexican plants, including its facility in Aguascalientes.\n\n“Mexico plays an important role in Nissan’s global operations, both as one of the main markets for vehicle sales, and as an export hub for dozens of markets around the world,” said Jeremie Papin, chairperson of Nissan Americas. The company still has faith in the region, and will introduce new Nissan electric vehicles such as the Nissan Kicks e-POWER to the Mexican market.\n\nMore Lover Than Competitor\n\nAlthough Mexico is producing fewer and fewer whole automobiles, the country is spectacular at producing automotive parts. “Despite the fact that fewer cars are being produced, in Mexico, we are making more for each car produced in our country,” said Manuel Montoya for Mexico Business News. Montoya is the president of the National Network of Automotive Industry Clusters, a non-profit that aims to promote automotive manufacturing in Mexico. “Thus, 2022 will be a year of growth for the Mexican automotive industry.”\n\nConway Data, the parent company of Site Selection magazine, has logged 90 automotive production facility projects in Mexico since the beginning of 2021, 64% of which are in parts manufacturing. This paints a tempting portrait for the Mexican auto parts industry, which grew by 21% in 2021.\n\nThe whole world seems to agree. Of these 90 projects — which include facility expansions, developments, and headquarters, — 61 are international, with the main players being the United States and Germany, who account for 37% of investment. Manufacturing represents 45% of all Mexican foreign direct investment, with the automotive industry as torch bearer.\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis reports U.S. investment totaled $9.3 billion in Mexico in 2021, with transportation equipment accounting for $981 million of that total. The countries are more co-conspirators than actual competitors, since investment and nearshoring in Mexico has huge benefits for the United States, and Mexico is a consumer of U.S. goods. In 2021 the Census Bureau found that the U.S. imported $385 billion in goods from Mexico, second only to China. The U.S. also exported $276 billion to Mexico, second to Canada, which recently unseated its USMCA trade partner.\n\nElectrifying Mexico\n\nAnalysts for The New York Times predict that by 2035 EVs will make up 25% of all new car sales and account for 60% of new sales by 2050. Demand for EVs is soaring, and buyers often have to put down deposits months ahead of time or risk the model selling out. Automotive companies are likewise putting down deposits on Mexico’s EV future.\n\nIn 2018, Mexican electric car company Zacua started production in Puebla. The company’s two models resemble muscled Mini Coopers with a range of around 100 miles per charge, perfect for urban areas. After a COVID-induced hiatus the company began selling its first cars this year for a little more than US$30,000, though subsidies upwards of $2,000 are offered. The cars are majority Mexican made, but some parts are outsourced to Spanish and French brands. Zacua CEO Nazareth Black wants this to change.\n\n“When we started, we brought in the transmission systems from outside. Now, we make them at the plant,” she said in an interview with Diálogo Chino in June. “We want all the parts to be Mexican. That is what we have been doing over the years: working on supply issues.” Black said it can be difficult to compete with huge brands that have been coming to Mexico, realizing it’s cheap to assemble there. “Everything is more expensive for us than a global brand. If I buy 50 steering wheels, for example, Ford buys 5 million. Who will get it cheaper?”\n\nThe company is small, and vehicles are assembled by hand. Black wants to make the company attractive to foreign investors who want to use Mexico to enter North American markets, “So why don’t we make a platform to serve them? Either we see them as competition, or we collaborate and capitalize on this.”\n\nThe electric engine of Nissan’s Kicks e-POWER.\n\nCourtesy of Nissan\n\nIn 2021 GM announced a $1 billion investment in its Ramos Arizpe plant in Coahuila, Mexico, with the intention of making it the fifth electric-specific GM plant. Initial phases will include the production of battery packs and electric motors alongside gas engines, with the potential of producing full electric vehicles in 2023, including Cadillac crossovers.\n\nThere are further rumors of Tesla considering Mexico as its next production site, possibly to be announced at the end of 2022. This speculation comes as Chinese company Contemporary Amperex Technology is said to be considering two locations in Mexico with investments up to $5 billion, possibly in the states of Chihuahua or Coahuila close to the U.S. border and to Tesla’s Texas factory in metro Austin. The company is the world’s biggest maker of electric batteries for cars and is a main supplier for Tesla.\n\nThe marriage in locations between the supplier and manufacturer would funnel billions in investment to northern Mexico, which already houses 52.1% of the country’s auto parts production. Coahuila, the location of GM’s 40-year-old manufacturing operation, represents 17.2% of auto parts production, Chihuahua 11.9% and Nuevo Leon 11.4%. All three regions are along the Texas border and have an experienced workforce with coveted proximity to the U.S. and Canada.",

    "Should You Attend A Timeshare Presentation On Your Next Trip To Mexico?": "Share The Article\n\nLast Updated 6 hours ago\n\nIf you’ve traveled to Mexico in the last few years, you’ve probably run into someone at the airport or in your hotel offering you a seemingly incredible deal on something if only you agree to sign up for a timeshare presentation. Would you sit through a 90-minute timeshare presentation to save $986 on a 5-night stay at an all-inclusive? How about for a free taxi ride?\n\nThe ‘gifts’ for attending a timeshare presentation can range from a minuscule free taxi ride to a free stay at an all-inclusive. Obviously, one is more appealing than the other! However, unsuspecting travelers may find themselves swept up into a timeshare presentation without ever knowing that’s what they signed up for.\n\nThose in the timeshare industry are incredibly adept at getting people to sign up for presentations, hence why you will see so many right after landing at many major airports in Mexico.\n\nTravel Off Path has put together a guide to considering timeshare presentations in Mexico, with particular emphasis on the Cancun area. Read on for the Who, What, Where, When, and Why of timeshare presentations in Mexico.\n\nWhat Is A Timeshare?\n\nA simple explanation for a timeshare would be a vacation property that is “owned” fractionally by many people. Essentially, you would pay to “own” a property to use for a week or two every year. Often presented as a way to save some money, there may be certain instances where owning a timeshare could be beneficial. However, in most cases, travelers probably wouldn’t be saving enough to make it a 100% beneficial decision for future travel.\n\nMany popular hotel brands have their own versions of timeshares available, such as Disney Vacation Club, Marriott Vacations Worldwide, or Wyndham Destinations.\n\nWhen most people hear the word ‘timeshare,’ they don’t think of the actual property itself. For many, hours-long presentations with high-pressure salespeople come to mind. Indeed, the most common way people come into timeshare ownership is a direct result of attending a timeshare presentation. Many go into the presentation absolutely sure they won’t fall into a timeshare purchase. But, if this were always the case, companies wouldn’t be offering benefits for attending the presentations in the first place.\n\nWhy Should (Or Shouldn’t) You Attend A Timeshare Presentation?\n\nThe biggest reason you may consider attending a timeshare presentation is for the presentation offer. As referenced earlier, timeshare offers can range widely, from small things like a free meal to significant things like free hotel stays. Depending on their impact on your travels, some offers may be worth considering attending a timeshare presentation. Some typical offers for attending a timeshare presentation include:\n\nDiscounted or free hotel stays\n\nMeals or drinks\n\n“No cost” taxi rides\n\nFree tickets to events or parks (like Disney or Universal)\n\nFree spa treatments\n\nThis isn’t an extensive list by any means. Still, these are some of the more common offers for attending a timeshare presentation. Also, notice our use of the word free. This isn’t quite correct, as you will be giving up precious time you could enjoy during your vacation. This is one of the biggest reasons you shouldn’t consider attending a timeshare presentation on your next trip to Mexico.\n\nWho Should Attend? Who Shouldn’t? Who’s Presenting?\n\nWho Should Attend?\n\nTravelers on an extremely tight budget may benefit from attending a timeshare presentation. If money is really tight, some of the offers for attending a timeshare presentation may be beneficial. Suppose you can secure a free stay in a hotel up to your standard. In that case, one of the highest travel costs can be reduced immensely, sometimes completely.\n\nWho Shouldn’t Attend?\n\nSuppose you have the money to go on vacation to an area in Mexico you know you will enjoy without worrying too much about breaking the bank. In that case, a timeshare presentation will just feel like a waste of time for you. Also, if you are a person who can be easily swayed, stay as far away from a timeshare presentation as you can.\n\nThere is a reason the process is so lengthy and tedious. There’s a reason they are giving you free lunch. They want you to feel invested in the experience, and they want you to feel bad about saying no. If you aren’t the type that can stick to your decision in the face of high-pressure sales, do not go to a timeshare presentation.\n\nAn Author’s Anecdote\n\nMy wife and I got married when we were young and penniless. However, I didn’t let that deter us from going on a honeymoon. We saved as much as possible and searched for all sorts of ways to reduce costs. During a wedding show, we found out we could get four nights free at a decent hotel in Orlando as long as we attended a presentation about cookware. Being young a naïve, we happily signed up.\n\nAfter four grueling hours of hearing about how amazing this cookware was, we had to fight to contain our laughter as we said no to the hilariously overpriced $1400 set of pots and pans. We got our free stay in Orlando, and I wasn’t too annoyed about the lost time.\n\nI wish that’s where the story ended.\n\nAfter arriving in Orlando, we found out that we had to attend a timeshare presentation for the hotel stay to be free. Without writing a novel about how much I wish we had just paid for a hotel, I’ll summarize the experience.\n\nWe went to lunch with our timeshare salesperson, their treat, of course.\n\nWatched a 2-hour long video presentation about how fantastic the timeshare was.\n\nToured the timeshares\n\nFinally, we sat down to hear the final pitch (or so we thought). For the small price of $13,000, we could visit our timeshare property in Orlando once a year.\n\nThis was the easiest no thanks we’ve ever uttered. Mainly because we barely had $1,000 to our name. However, we said no an additional six times before we were finally able to leave. With each no, we would hear about some new deal that would lower the price by a few thousand dollars. The final time they asked, they offered that same $13,000 timeshare for $2,400. We said no every time, and with each no, they made us feel worse and worse. They will really try to make you feel bad for saying no.\n\nI wish we hadn’t fallen into not one but two presentation traps. For what we received, it wasn’t worth the time. However, had the final payout been a weeklong stay at an all-inclusive resort? I would probably feel differently, especially because of how little money we had at the time.\n\nNow, however, the presentation offer would have to be mind-blowing to get us to attend another one.\n\nWhen And Where Should You Expect “Timeshare Sharks”?\n\nThe most common place you will see timeshare salespeople will be after landing at the airport in Mexico. Cancun is notorious for this, but many other airports also have them. According to Rene Gaudreau, while taking a video of Cancun airport, “All these people here are trying to sell you timeshares, they’re lined up on both sides… they’re going to try and stop you, they’ll lie to you, they’ll tell you anything, they’re going to tell you they are your transportation company… just ignore them, your transportation company is outside.”\n\nNot Interested?\n\nIf you have zero interest in seeing what timeshare salespeople have to say, just ignore them and head to your transportation outside the airport. As stated in the video, many timeshare reps inside the airport will claim to be your transportation to trick you into attending a timeshare presentation. Don’t fall for it! Your transport will always be outside the airport waiting and will never meet you inside.\n\n#mexicotrip #traveltiktok ♬ Oh No – Kreepa @jennifervalentinephoto Let’s talk about timeshares on your vacation, there is no way to get out of the hotel asking you about this whike on vacation- they will usually give you some type of perk to come to their presentation that they say is an hour long.. Fun fact it usually is way over an hour long intense sales pitch lol ( I know from personal experience when I was a young traveler) – tell them no thank you and enjoy your vacation! Don’t be locked into a rate for the next 30 years 😌 #travelagent\n\nAnother place you could see timeshare salespeople would be right on your resort’s property. It’s not uncommon to get a call from the front desk letting you know you could attend a “breakfast presentation” for a percentage off your stay or other perks. Similarly, watch out for the ‘activities manager’ or the ‘concierge.’ Sometimes these roles are just a timeshare rep in disguise, as Rosamarie T details in a Tripadvisor review. However, this isn’t always the case. If you feel you are being pulled into a timeshare sales attempt and aren’t interested, simply walk away.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nWhether or not you should attend a timeshare presentation on your next trip is ultimately a decision left to you. Hopefully, some of this information can help you decide whether it is in your best interest. However, be extremely careful if you choose to go to a presentation. Timeshares are notoriously difficult to get out of and can be a serious financial commitment. If you can’t trust yourself to say no (assuming you don’t want a timeshare), don’t risk it!\n\nThis article originally appeared on Travel Off Path.

    "As numbers rise, the hardships of migration through Mexico multiply": "TAPACHULA, Mexico\n\nTapachula, a town on the Mexico-Guatemala border known for its stifling heat, has earned the nickname of a “migrant prison”. Thousands of people hoping to reach the United States have found themselves detained or stuck here, waiting months to obtain a humanitarian visa and struggling to survive in the city long enough to acquire one.\n\nMigrants and asylum seekers who attempt to leave the city and go north on a bus will swiftly encounter a checkpoint where all on board must present their documents to a Mexican immigration officer.\n\nThose unable to obtain a humanitarian visa often end up at the region's largest detention centre, Siglo XXI, a hellish facility where migrants report not receiving food and having their belongings – including their documents – taken by officials.\n\nIn early August, a Haitian died in captivity. Soon after, 126 Venezuelans held at the prison were deported back to their country.\n\nSiglo XXI detention centre has held up to 1,200 migrants at any one time this year (at least 300 above capacity), many awaiting deportation.\n\nMexico has long been a tricky way station for migrants to navigate en route to the United States, but the tough conditions are likely to become worse: Under President Joe Biden, the United States has been quietly pressing Mexico to accept more migrants from Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, according to a Reuters report. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken raised concerns about the escalation in crossings from the three countries when he visited Mexico City last week, two US and two Mexican officials told Reuters. Mexico did not commit to specific actions.\n\nStill, many migrants and asylum seekers find themselves trapped in an administrative maze, suffering corrupt and sometimes abusive officials as they travel through dangerous regions, caught up in flares of violence from organised crime groups, or exploited by coyotes or polleros.\n\nThe sheer numbers trying to make the journey have also compounded problems in border towns. Between October 2021 and September 2022, US Customs and Border Patrol apprehended a record 2 million migrants, a 20 percent increase from the same period a year ago. Some 40 percent of the migrants and asylum seekers are from nations outside Mexico and Central America, according to the UN’s emergency aid coordination body, OCHA.\n\n“It’s so much worse than the situation we left. We need to get out of here.”\n\nMany who aren’t arrested find their situations equally grim. Grace, a Venezuelan who didn’t want to share her last name because her family still didn’t know she had left the country in the hope of reaching the United States, came to the Jesús el Buen Pastor migrant shelter with her five-year-old daughter in June. The shelter is a non-profit organisation, run by a local woman.\n\nGrace said she had never lived in such squalid conditions: people sleeping outdoors for lack of beds, bowls of beans for dinner, and overflowing bathrooms. The shelter has held some 1,000 to 1,400 people at any time, as opposed to a mere 500 in previous years.\n\n“It’s so much worse than the situation we left,” she told The New Humanitarian. “We need to get out of here.”\n\nInflux of Cubans, Venezuelans, and Haitians\n\nThe Mexican government’s policy of restricting tens of thousands of migrants and asylum seekers to one city has caused such shelters to become desperate, unable to feed everyone off donations.\n\nThe majority currently staying at the Buen Pastor shelter are Venezuelan, following a wave of Cuban migrants and asylum seekers, and before that, Haitians. Government data confirm increases in Cubans, Venezuelans, and Haitians this year, while violence and hunger in Central America has maintained a steady stream of people from that region too.\n\nAccording to COMAR, the Mexican government’s asylum department, 67,000 people applied for refugee status between January and July this year. That is over four times the 16,000 people who applied during the same period last year, when Mexico registered the third highest number of asylum applicants globally. Nearly all of them passed through Tapachula.\n\n“The Haitians face language barriers and a new kind of racism that groups of migrants in the past have not had to contend with.”\n\nAmérico Daniel, another Venezuelan, said he would rather sleep out on the street than in an overcrowded shelter. For the past several months, migrants and asylum seekers have slept in the Parque Bicentenário and other central plazas in Tapachula.\n\n“Of the seven countries I’ve travelled through, Mexico has been the worst in its treatment of migrants coming through. It’s chaos here,” he said.\n\nDaniel arrived in Tapachula as part of a so-called “migrant caravan”, which transit through the region in greater numbers for security. His included citizens of over a dozen countries, from as far away as Bangladesh, but most people were from Latin America and the Caribbean. Most of the Venezuelans and Haitians had crossed, roughly two weeks earlier, the Darién Gap, a dangerous strip of jungle with no roads bridging Colombia and Panama. It often takes migrants a week or more to traverse the area, leaving them vulnerable to dehydration, robberies, and deadly accidents.\n\nRead more → A Cuban asylum seeker’s dangerous odyssey\n\nThe different nationalities within this wave of migrants present distinct vulnerabilities while travelling through Mexico, said Enrique Vidal, head of coordination at the Centre for Human Rights Fray Matías de Córdova, an organisation that provides migrants and asylum seekers with access to resources such as legal assistance and investigates claims of abuse.\n\n“The Haitians face language barriers and a new kind of racism that groups of migrants in the past have not had to contend with,” Vidal said. “Meanwhile, the Cubans face higher fees and prices for everything. They are expected to pay five to ten times more, or to pay in dollars, and the Venezuelans are now hit with a lot of fake news targeting them.”\n\nA recent news report blames Meta, the company behind Facebook and messaging app WhatsApp, for enabling human smuggling by not removing dangerous, misleading information posted by smugglers on the platforms. Meta says it prohibits content that could encourage smuggling.\n\nIn June, the Fray Matías centre released a statement arguing that care for refugees and migrants is abysmal in Mexico, and “could not be more irresponsible”.\n\nEarlier this year, the Mexican Supreme Court announced that the practice of carrying out document checkpoints on highways was unconstitutional and racist.\n\nBut little has changed. Neither the National Migration Institute (INM), nor Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, have responded to the ruling.\n\nThe winding, dangerous path out\n\nNorth of Tapachula, in the town of Huixtla, Mexico’s largest checkpoint operates more like a full-scale bus depot than a roadblock. It was built in 2014 with financial assistance from the United States.\n\nThose who make it through the many checkpoints that line the country all the way through to Mexico’s northern border with the United States still risk cartel violence and kidnappings for ransom as well as abuse at the hands of both US and Mexican authorities. In August, an average of roughly 6,800 migrants were apprehended at the US border every day – that daily number peaked in April, at approximately 8,000.\n\nmap_mexico2.jpg Lillian Perlmutter/TNH Migrants in Tapachula study a map provided by Mexican authorities of transit routes through the country.\n\nAccording to Vidal, the US government may urge Mexico to detain and deport a larger number of people travelling north since the recent overturning of the Remain in Mexico policy, which could allow thousands of Central Americans – many of whom have been waiting for months at the US border for their asylum claims to progress – to begin crossing more freely.\n\n“After the Mérida Initiative from 2006, which was a military agreement between the two countries, the United States government has a hand in keeping migration detention centres active in Mexico,” Vidal explained.\n\nPaperwork backlogs cause more of a bottleneck\n\nMigrants stuck in Tapachula must first go to the office of COMAR and acquire a certification of refugee status. Then they can make an appointment with the INM, the Mexican migration authority, to apply for a humanitarian visa – a small card allowing migrants to travel freely in Mexico for a year.\n\nA steep backlog is just one hurdle. As thousands wait, an estimated 300-400 more people cross from Guatemala to Tapachula every day. That means the current process to acquire the visa can take up to six months, according to migrants and aid workers.\n\nThe appointment sign-up section of the INM website was down for months earlier this year. In recent weeks, appointments for refugee certification at COMAR were rescheduled without properly notifying migrants, which led to anger and confusion.\n\nCOMAR did not respond to questions about migrants’ allegations of disorganisation, cancellations, and rescheduling of appointments.\n\nMost migrants do not have enough money to live in Tapachula for six months, especially without stable, lucrative work. Many landlords will not rent to migrants.\n\nThe long waits have led to protests in front of the INM office in Tapachula, including one in which migrants sewed their lips shut to represent their predicament. In February, a protest became violent after an INM officer deliberately threw a migrant’s papers into the dust.\n\nMigrants and asylum seekers told The New Humanitarian the only way to avoid six months in Tapachula is to join a caravan. This summer saw the largest caravan ever in Mexico, with roughly 10,000 people leaving Tapachula on 3 June.\n\nMost of this year’s caravans were organised by Luís Villagrán, a migrant advocate and director of the Centro de Dignificación Humana. Villagrán holds caravan meetings before departures are scheduled and passes around a list for migrants to add their names and ID numbers to. He hand-delivers this list to the INM office in Tapachula several days before departure.\n\nIn an attempt to break up caravans before they leave the city, INM will regularly send those on Villagrán’s list to a different Mexican city right away to acquire the humanitarian visa at the INM office there, where wait times are lower. “This is usually the best-case scenario,” Villagrán said.\n\nViolence, corruption, and fake news\n\nThe caravans that don’t get broken up by INM can still face violent altercations with National Guard troops.\n\nIn April, Villagrán defied authorities by leading a caravan of several thousand people out of Tapachula without visas before being intercepted by National Guard officers some 18 kilometres outside the city. “They started beating me with a baton,” Villagrán said. “Some of the migrants fought back using the wooden cross that we carried with us, and the troops responded by beating them up even worse.”\n\nSo far this year, INM has arrested nearly double the number of migrants compared to 2021. Sometimes, it is unknown why INM arrests certain migrants and holds them for deportation. According to Villagrán, the night before the caravan was set to leave on 3 June, INM raided a motel where caravan participants were staying and arrested 50 people seemingly arbitrarily.\n\n“We are investigating several cases of torture, sexual, and physical abuse by INM officers in the Siglo XXI detention centre this year,” Vidal said. “And those are just the people who have come forward, which is likely much smaller than the total.”\n\n“The policy of making everyone wait in the Tapachula to process documents makes everything so much more complicated than it needs to be.”\n\nPierre-Marc René, a press representative at the UN’s refugee agency, UNHCR, said there have been a few positive changes. “For example, after pressure from many groups, they are no longer detaining children in Tapachula,” René told The New Humanitarian. “But the policy of making everyone wait in the Tapachula to process documents makes everything so much more complicated than it needs to be.”\n\nIn mid-June, a group of primarily Venezuelans, humanitarian visas in hand, boarded a bus in the northern Mexican state of Coahuila headed for the city of Acuña, a popular crossing point into Texas. National Guard troops stopped the bus and ordered everyone on board to get off and go south to Monterrey or face violent consequences. One young man was then led off the bus, handcuffed, and beaten in front of the rest of the passengers.\n\nThat day, an INM official in Coahuila falsely claimed during a press conference that the humanitarian visa does not give a migrant licence to enter Mexico’s northern border states.\n\n“INM is spreading a lot of disinformation to the Venezuelan community right now, telling them about opportunities [for priority processing] that don’t exist, and setting them up to get into situations where they will be detained,” Vidal said. “There’s a permanent level of corruption within INM that has worsened during the pandemic. If a migrant wants to get their papers smoothly, they would pay a corruption fee.”\n\nINM did not respond to multiple interview requests for this story.\n\nBarriers to access\n\nBoth Vidal and Villagrán said changes in practice and policy by authorities since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic have hindered the work of humanitarian aid organisations trying to help the millions passing through Central and Latin America.\n\n“Using the pandemic as a pretext, they took away our private access to people in the detention centre. Now, if we’re having conversations with anyone, there is always an INM officer in the room, so the migrants never feel comfortable speaking freely anymore,” Vidal said. “We used to accompany migrants from the Guatemalan border to Tapachula, to make sure they arrived safely. Now, INM won’t let us – they call it human trafficking,” he added.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross is still allowed private interviews with migrants in detention, a privilege no longer extended to Vidal and his colleagues at the Fray Matías centre in Cordova.\n\n“This is not going to get better even if the number of migrants lowers in the next few months,” Vidal said. “And we know that is not going to happen anyway, because looking at Cuba right now, and the number of people moving through Panama as we speak, the numbers are only going to increase.”\n\nEdited by Paula Dupraz-Dobias and P.J.

    "This Unknown City In Mexico Is Becoming One Of The Most Popular Destinations In The Country": "Share The Article\n\nLast Updated 4 days ago\n\nIt seems like Mexico has a new star in the making, as an unknown city that had never before been widely promoted as a destination takes center stage as part of the country’s tourism offer. It does not have a shoreline and thus no pristine beaches like those found in the Caribbean, nor the Yucatan Peninsula’s Mayan monuments, but it is rapidly becoming one of the most popular destinations south of the border.\n\nEver since the world’s borders reopened for tourism and normal tourism resumed, Mexico has claimed for itself the coveted title of King of Tourism, and it’s not hard to see why. Being a country rich in nature and home to numerous iconic landmarks, it is a natural leader in vacation bookings, especially when it comes to sunny getaways.\n\nShockingly though, most visitors to Mexico still fail to grasp how actually diverse and multicultural it truly is – or did, up until this year:\n\nThe Secret Is Out: Mexico Is So Much More Than A Sunny Beach Break\n\nTo reduce Mexico to its resort zones and the occasional mystical ancient pyramid is a crude mistake. Yes, these attractions contribute hugely to making the country great, and we definitely cannot underestimate the power of Cancun as a winter hotspot, but at the same time, a majority of Mexico, and arguably where its untarnished beauty is found, has been concealed from the public eye for years.\n\nLuckily, things are changing, and tourists, including American vacationers, have started to venture more inland in search of ‘more Mexico’, as opposed to being isolated in one of the Riviera Maya’s colossal tourist complexes year after year. This trend translates into actual numbers: a growing number of travelers are seeking more unique experiences when visiting Mexico.\n\nAt the forefront of Mexico’s Tourism Renaissance are its colonial towns, many of which are protected by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites. One of those, the unsung Guanajuato, has been smashing arrival figures, not only because it has its own international airport, allowing for easier access, but due to the fact that it’s simply stunning.\n\nAlthough many are not aware of this, Mexico is where some of the oldest European settlements in the Americas are located. Guanajuato is a prime example of that, with narrow, winding streets lined with ocher-colored houses emulating those found in Spain, and Neo-Gothic churches piercing the skyline.\n\nWhat Makes Guanajuato So Damn Special?\n\nBoth in 2021 and 2022, it was named the Best City in the World according to Travel + Leisure, while Mexico itself deemed it the country’s most beautiful this year. Guanajuato is indeed a sight to behold, not to mention bucket list material, but those who might have wished to keep this gem all to themselves a while longer may be disappointed to learn the secret is out.\n\nAccording to Juan Jose Alvarez Brunel, Secretary of Tourism of Guanajuato, by the end of 2022, the city is expected to recover roughly 70 percent of its tourists, a much higher rate than entire countries – we see you Australia and Canada – and a surprising figure for a non-coastal city that, for the most part, hasn’t been a priority for Mexican Tourism.\n\nThe data has been provided by different service providers, including those in the private sector, academics, and even the World Tourism Organization. As Brunel puts it, should Guanajuato keep up the pace, by late 2023, it should be back to where it was in 2019 and even ‘begin to grow again’. Doesn’t sound too impressive?\n\nWell, that is perhaps because the vast majority of Americans visiting Mexico flock to Cancun, and Cancun only. Of course, when it comes purely to arrivals and gross revenue, there is no beating the Caribbean jewel, but we must understand that, due to being so popular, there is over-representation when it comes to tourism trends and the Riviera Maya.\n\nIn A World Where Giants Like Cancun Exist, Guanajuato’s Recovery Rate Is Nothing Short Of Stellar\n\nA large sum of Mexico’s hard-earned tourist dollars are spent in Cancun, Tulum, and other neighboring municipalities, and naturally, those will bounce back much faster, or even entirely eclipse, other minor destinations in the country. The fact that Guanajuato is repositioning itself as a much stronger competitor this year and still getting its share when so much of Mexican travel revolves around the Caribbean cities is nothing short of stellar.\n\nThis success story is largely attributed to the regional tourism authorities, who boldly envisioned Guanajuato as Mexico’s cultural, enotourism, and gastronomy capital. Regarding the latter, they surely have enough reasons to brag, seeing that UNESCO itself granted Guanajuato’s food scene an ‘Intangible Gastronomy World Heritage’ status in 2020.\n\nCurrently, the motto is the following:\n\nGuanajuato is where visitors can live great stories\n\nYou may be wondering why, considering Guanajuato may not have been a priority on your planned itinerary for Mexico until you came across this article. Allow us to explain why according to the Secretary’s own assertions:\n\nIt is truly one of Mexico’s top enotourism destinations, being the fourth largest producer with 43 vineyards *\n\n* Its Old Town, dating back to the 16th century, has been deemed by UNESCO a true architectural wonder\n\nGuanajuato is within short driving distance of numerous other colonial hotspots of Mexico, including the charming San Miguel de Allende\n\nof numerous other colonial hotspots of Mexico, including the charming San Miguel de Allende The International Airport of Guanajuato offers direct flights from several U.S. cities, including Chicago, both from Midway and O’Hare, Houston, Dallas, and Los Angeles\n\n*21 of those vineyards welcome tourists/guided tours\n\nOther Perks Of Making Guanajuato Your Next Winter Vacay\n\nOnce landing in Guanajuato, tourists have facilitated access to 46 municipalities across the state, including its eponymous capital, by means of a ‘comprehensive road system’ cutting across the territory and reaching deep into Mexico’s more quaint, authentic countryside. Other highlights mentioned include:\n\nVarious hotel chains as well as independent accommodation providers\n\nA myriad of hot springs, spas, and wellness centers that will give the Mayan Worlds a run for their money\n\nthat will give the Mayan Worlds a run for their money World-renowned restaurants (Guanajuato’s cuisine has been noted by UNESCO, remember?)\n\n20 percent of Guanajuato State is a ‘natural protected area’ , home to 45 percent of all bird species in the country – any nature lovers here?\n\n, home to 45 percent of all bird species in the country – any nature lovers here? Great infrastructure, something we already discussed briefly writing on San Miguel de Allende\n\nAs Mr. Brunel brilliantly puts it, Guanajuato has no beaches, but it does not need them: its man-made colonial wonders and foodie scene are exactly what sets it apart from coastal Mexico and precisely the reason why it’s experiencing a revival lately.\n\nRead More:\n\nTravel Insurance That Covers Covid-19 For 2022\n\nMexico Enters Hurricane Season This Month – Here’s What To Expect If You’re Visiting\n\n7 Tips To Travel Stress Free During Your Fall Trip To Mexico\n\nMexico Has Already Welcomed 36 Million International Tourists This Year\n\nResearch Shows Los Cabos Is One Of The Safest Destinations In Mexico\n\nThis article originally appeared on Travel Off Path.

A wheelbarrow full of mangos sat to one side. This is where Jorge Sánchez Ordóñez, 36, does most of his journalism. It’s also the house from which his father was kidnapped seven years ago. The home looks more imposing now than it did then. After the abduction, workers for the Federal Mechanism for the Protection of Human Rights Workers and Journalists installed security cameras and a metal fence crowned with barbed wire.\n\nWhen Jorge Sánchez leaves the property, he wears a plain black T-shirt and jeans; he wants to look nondescript, especially as he delivers the tamales and chiles rellenos that his family sells to fund his work. But when he arrives at a scene to report, he pulls out his single-lens reflex camera, hangs a press pass from the rearview mirror of his car, and puts on a navy-blue vest with his father’s name embroidered under the slogan, “To live with fear is not an option.”\n\nJorge Sánchez is one of a handful of volunteer journalists at La Unión, the publication that his father, Moisés Sánchez Cerezo, founded. The paper has grown from its early days in the 1980s when it was a flyer handed out around town. Now it’s a digital outlet with more than 17,000 Facebook followers and an occasional print edition. It remains free, ensuring that everyone in the community can read it.\n\nLa Unión’s focus is denuncia social, or social criticism—essentially local accountability reporting. It’s an emphasis that has proved deadly for journalists in Mexico, including Moisés Sánchez, whose body was found weeks after his kidnapping with signs of torture.\n\nOutside of active war zones, Mexico is the most dangerous country in the world for media workers. Since 2005, more than 30 reporters have been killed in the state of Veracruz alone. On September 19 at The Hague, the People’s Tribunal on the Murder of Journalists, which was organized by a group of media freedom organizations, declared Mexico (along with Sri Lanka and Syria) “guilty of all the human rights violations brought against them.” The unofficial court has no legal authority, but Miguel Ángel López Solana, the son of assassinated journalist Miguel Ángel López Velasco, read aloud part of the verdict at a public event in Veracruz.\n\nIt’s not only international groups trying to raise awareness about the attacks against reporters. The Network in Memory and Struggle for Assassinated or Disappeared Journalists, which was founded earlier this year, includes representatives from 14 families with relatives of murdered media workers. While it is the first collective in Mexico to unite around victims who were journalists, it is part of a long history of memory work in Latin America.\n\n“Mexico is a country with no memory,” said Patricia Espinosa, a preschool teacher in Mexico City whose brother Rubén Espinosa, a photojournalist, was killed in 2015. “Something happens today, and right now it’s news, and right now it’s important, but after a few months it’s no longer material.… We’ve gotten used to living with this quantity of cases.”\n\nAccording to Artículo 19, an NGO dedicated to press freedom in Mexico and Central America, the majority of documented aggressions against Mexican journalists are committed by government officials. The founders of the Network say the government has conducted smear campaigns against their deceased family members, bungled forensic processes, and mishandled their cases. Yet the group’s mission is not just to demand justice within the judicial system; with 98 percent of journalist murders in the country going unpunished, members told me that this goal often seems out of reach. The organization also commemorates murdered reporters and photographers, honors their work, and publicly and accurately discusses their assassinations to raise the political cost of future killings.\n\nThe Argentinian sociologist Elizabeth Jelin describes this type of memory work as part of a broader movement to confront large-scale impunity. In her book State Repression and the Labors of Memory, she writes, “Memory, truth, and justice blend into each other, because the meaning of the past that is being fought about is, in fact, part and parcel of the demand for justice in the present.”\n\nThis year, 15 media workers have been murdered in Mexico in possible retaliation for their reporting. After years of running into one another at protests and memorials for their dead relatives, the members of what would become the Network began to organize this spring as three more journalists from Veracruz were killed: José Luis Gamboa, Yesenia Mollinedo Falconi, and Sheila Johana García Olivera.\n\nYazmín López Solana, a nurse, and Isabel Luna Varela, an office worker, have been friendly for years, because their relatives worked together at a newspaper before they were killed in separate attacks. Yazmín López told me that when heard about this year’s murders she felt like the 11 years since the assassination of her family members had frozen, “and I was sitting here once again.”\n\nIsabel Luna added, “It feels really ugly to think that another family is going through the same thing.”\n\nJorge Sánchez, the Network’s spokesperson, has been demanding that the government hold the killers of journalists accountable. He has received threats related to both his reporting and his activism. Such threats are part of why he said it made sense for surviving family members to form a collective. “Imagine that they’ve just assassinated your relative,” he explained to me. “You have to travel. You have to look for lawyers.… On top of that, the fear of what you’re going to do, will you flee? You have to take care of yourself. They call you. They threaten you. You don’t sleep.” Helping others out with this combination of circumstances, he said, is a major reason the organization is so necessary.\n\nAs the Network grows, Jorge Sánchez said he hopes it can expand to support members in other states, but for now it’s a challenge just to coordinate the group in Veracruz, which covers nearly 30,000 square miles. The Network is fundraising for its members’ travel expenses so it can host more in-person events—whether those are talks with organizations dedicated to journalist safety, protests following a journalist’s death, or a chance to meet with the government about their cases. In August, they met with nine federal and state organizations to insist that “their petitions and agreements don’t stay in the realm of ‘goodwill’ or ‘empty words,’ rather that there be a real commitment on the part of the government bodies to follow up on the cases and make positive progress.”\n\nSurvivors told me repeatedly that being related to an assassinated journalist comes with challenges. In 2012, after her brother Guillermo Luna Varela, a photojournalist for Veracruz News, and uncle Gabriel Huge, a former reporter for NOTIVER, were murdered alongside Irasema Becerra, her colleague at El Dictamen, Isabel Luna was fired from her job selling ads. “I think maybe they didn’t want to deal with another death,” she said.\n\nFears of relatives’ being killed are not unfounded. When gunmen shot dead Yazmín López’s father, Miguel Ángel López Velasco, then the director of crime reporting at NOTIVER, they also murdered her mother, Agustina Solana, an employee of the Mexican Institute of Social Security, and her brother Misael López Solana, a budding photojournalist.\n\nShortly afterward, Yazmín López said she was driving in Veracruz when “a ton of people armed with long guns” blocked her path, forced her from her truck, and stole the vehicle. It wasn’t clear whether the robbery was related to the assassination, but she worried that it might be and spent years afraid to speak out.\n\nYazmín López told me anomalies have also plagued many of the investigations. “We ourselves, the family, mopped up the blood from how they left the bodies,” she said. “They left the blood, and they never came back to pick up the bullets. We found the bullets. We found the casings. We found pieces of teeth.… The police never did a good job collecting evidence.”\n\nPartly because of the mismanagement of the crime scene, Yazmín López believes that her family’s murderers will never be brought to justice. This summer, in a ceremony attended by the Network, Yazmín López’s surviving brother, with the support of Reporters Without Borders, mounted a plaque in their honor in Veracruz. Having a place to mourn has meant a lot to Yazmín López. “There are people that don’t have a place to go to cry over their family,” she said. “There are people who still haven’t found their family members.… I want them to feel what I’m feeling in this moment.”\n\nThere’s a pattern in Veracruz, Jorge Sánchez told me, in which the government officials charged with finding the killers blame the victim by tying the person to other forms of crime. This tars the journalist, their surviving family, and their colleagues as undeserving of justice and creates room for the government to close the case without investigating itself.\n\nJust days before his disappearance, Jorge’s father, Moisés Sánchez, told his family that he’d heard that the mayor, Omar Cruz Reyes, had threatened him in a private meeting. It took months before the state congress authorized an investigation into Cruz, and in the interim, he fled the state. Seven years later, he remains at large.\n\nAfter Moisés Sánchez’s disappearance, federal police showed up at the family home with surprising news: They had found explosives in the trunk of the taxi he drove to support his work with La Unión. But the Sánchez family had taken photos of the car, including inside the trunk, when Moisés Sánchez was kidnapped, and no explosives were present.\n\n“So then, because they could see that we had proof that their accusation was false, they had to desist, and they didn’t continue with that angle,” Jorge Sánchez said.\n\nJorge Sánchez isn’t exactly sure what the police were trying to achieve by planting explosives in his father’s taxi. Perhaps, he said, they were trying to imply that he “worked for a terrorist cell, or something like that.” But the family has been vigilant in protecting Moisés Sánchez’s legacy—including pushing back against the government’s attempts to minimize his journalism. After Moisés Sánchez was kidnapped, the governor of Veracruz himself referred to him, dismissively, as a “taxi driver and neighborhood activist.”\n\nLater in 2015, when unknown assailants assassinated Rubén Espinosa alongside Nadia Vera, Yesenia Quiroz, Mile Virginia Martín, and Alejandra Negrete in Mexico City, the local attorney general’s office published toxicology reports indicating that Espinosa and Vera had consumed drugs. The government also investigated rumors that Martín, a Colombian model, was a sex worker, based mainly on her nationality and profession.\n\nFor Patricia Espinosa, Rubén Espinosa’s sister, those speculations are beside the point. “It’s a method that the authorities and their allies in the media use to stain the image of the people [involved], so that society will say ‘Ah, well… That’s why they were assassinated,’” she told me. “The authorities, instead of looking at the perpetrators, turn their gaze on the victims.”\n\nOn the anniversary of the assassinations in Mexico City, activists and family members hold a festival called “Arte Para No Olvidarte,” or “Art So I Won’t Forget You.” Outside the apartment where the five were shot, the group conducts a ceremony to “resignify the space,” followed by performances and the testimonies of family members. This year, there was a demonstration in the Veracruz state capital as well.\n\nItzamná Ponce and Daniela Guillén, who help organize Arte Para No Olvidarte every year, told me that in the face of actions intended to provoke terror, joy is an important form of resistance. “Smiles, dancing, partying…art, music, laughter, hugs, tenderness, for us have been those spaces of searching and demanding justice and struggling,” Ponce said. “From that place, what we’ve tried to do is this: to generate a space of resistance out of our smiles. Because that’s something they’re trying to take away from us.”\n\nOn a humid summer evening, many of the neighbors in Fraccionamiento Arboledas San Miguel, a neighborhood in Medellín de Bravo, were outside searching for a breeze. There was a soccer game in progress, and near the pitch, a handful of people had gathered around an exposed electrical cable. Jorge Sánchez stood with them, camera in hand, as they explained how the neighborhood’s developer was refusing to reroute the cables underground. They told him that the exposed cable posed a fire risk to the neighborhood, that there was no street lighting at night, and that uncovered manholes lined the roads. A teen had even fallen into a manhole and injured his hand.\n\nThe next morning, Jorge Sánchez wrote up the article. “Those affected said that since VIVEICA, the developer which built the neighborhood, declared bankruptcy, no one has taken an interest in or attended to the neighborhood’s problems, evidenced by the fact that they now have been living for more than a month without adequate electrical service,” he reported in the piece.\n\nThis might seem like straightforward journalism, but for Jorge Sánchez, it’s a rejection of fear. When he goes out to report, people remember him as a boy accompanying his father. They still call him “Moi”—short for Moisés. And as his father used to say, to live with fear is not an option. “If we’re afraid, we’ll never do anything. And things are going to stay the same,” Sánchez said. “We have to do something.”",
    "This smartphone manufacturer beat Samsung and Apple in Mexico": "On average, Samsung is the world’s largest smartphone manufacturer. However, it doesn’t lead all its rivals in every market and performs better in some regions than others. In some markets, Samsung is the leading brand by a wide margin. While in others, such as Mexico, the company is trying to maintain its spot on the podium.\n\nMexico has an active smartphone user base of around 127 million, and needless to say, there are benefits to leading the mobile game in the country. But it’s neither Samsung nor its biggest rival, Apple, at the top of the food chain in Mexico. According to a recent report, Motorola was the leading OEM in Mexico in Q2 2022, with a smartphone sales share of 28%. (via Telecompaper)\n\nMotorola keeps a tight grip over the Mexican smartphone market\n\nAlthough Motorola led the country’s smartphone scene, Samsung was, thankfully, the second-largest OEM in Mexico during the three-month period ending in June. The company captured 26% of smartphone sales throughout the quarter.\n\nApple followed Samsung in third place. The Cupertino giant rose 3% to capture 16% of the market. Motorola’s share in Q2 2022 increased by 5%, while Samsung’s share remained flat from last year. Other notable smartphone brands were Xiaomi, Oppo, and Huawei. Xiaomi held 13% of the market, while Oppo and Huawei captured 11% and 5%, respectively.\n\nIn other news, Samsung’s chief recently visited Mexico to meet with President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, but this had little to do with the company’s performance in the smartphone segment in Q2. Instead, Samsung’s Lee Jae-yong has requested support from the Mexican President for Busan World Expo 2030.",
    "Avelo Eyes International Expansion With Mexico, Canada, & Caribbean On The Cards": "Avelo Airlines has been rapidly building its presence in the US domestic market. Its network of more than 30 destinations on both the east and west coasts, often flying into underserved airports, has seen it expand its footprint massively over the past year and a half.\n\nWhile the airline has certainly not exhausted all its options when it comes to domestic connections, flying internationally could well be in its future. Speaking exclusively to Simple Flying, President and CEO of Avelo, Andrew Levy, said that it’s not a question of if, but when. He said,\n\n“We were not actively looking at that, but we absolutely will fly International, it's just a question of when, not if. We are a flag carrier, which means we have all the designations that you need to be able to serve international points on scheduled service. We have lots and lots of experience among our team in terms of international operations. So I do expect that that will come.”\n\nWhere would Avelo fly?\n\nFor Avelo Airlines, any international would need to be a modular progression from its existing hubs and network. It would also need to retain its out-and-back mentality; as yet, Avelo doesn’t fly any route that would leave the plane and crew requiring an overnight stop.\n\nRight now, the airline has a strong presence in the Florida region, with hubs at both Orlando and at Fort Myers. Both of these could open opportunities to the south.\n\nIn the north of the east coast, its original east coast hub airport at Tweed New Haven is far enough north that Canada is entirely doable, without spoiling its out and back in a day strategy. Ottawa, Montreal, Toronto, Hamilton, are all well within the reach of Avelo.\n\nOn the other side of the country, its hub at Hollywood Burbank opens opportunities in both directions. Mexico is just to the south, while to the north, the airline already flies to Pasco Tri-Cities Airport, just a hop and a skip from Vancouver.\n\nLevy agreed with our assessment of its opportunities, stating that,\n\n“For us, international would be … close in, more of a leisure or VFR type focus, which is going to be mostly probably Mexico, Caribbean, those types of things. Certainly, there could be some possibilities in Canada perhaps.”\n\nLong-haul, low-cost doesn’t work\n\nAlthough Avelo could eye some near international destinations to the north and south of the USA, Levy was clear that he has no aspirations to start flying further afield. He said,\n\n“I don't foresee ever deciding to go get really big airplanes that fly across the pond or anything like that. I don't believe in long-haul low-cost - That's not for me. I've never seen it work and someone else will have to prove that one out, one day, maybe…”\n\nPlenty of airlines have had a crack at long-haul, low-cost operations, and plenty have fallen as a result. Those who survive in the longer haul market are either less low-cost than the ULCC that Avelo is – think JetBlue – or they’re flying true LCC services but with long-range narrowbodies – think Wizz Air and some of its A321LR routes.\n\nIt’s always been a tough nut to crack, and for Levy, it’s just a step too far. Nevertheless, we could see some interesting destinations added to the route map in the future that make sense for Avelo to serve.\n\nYou can watch the complete interview with Andrew on the video link below:\n\nWhere would you like to see Avelo landing north or south of the US border?

    "Mexico Seen Boosting Rates More Than Expected to 11%, BofA Says": "Mexico Seen Boosting Rates More Than Expected to 11%, BofA Says\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Mexico’s central bank is expected to hike borrowing costs more than expected, finishing the year with the key interest rate at 11%, up from a previous estimate of 10%, as it prioritizes stability over growth, according to economists at Bank of America Corp.\n\nBanxico, as the central bank is known, is now seen implementing two consecutive rate increases of 75 basis points in September and November before a 50 basis points hike in December, BofA economists Carlos Capistran and Christian Gonzalez Rojas wrote in a report dated Sunday after an investor trip in Mexico.\n\nThe board of Banxico meets this week, with all economists surveyed by Bloomberg expecting the bank to announce a 75 basis-point increase on Sept. 29, taking the rate to 9.25%.\n\n“Our main takeaway is that Mexico continues to prioritize stability over growth,” Capistran and Gonzalez Rojas wrote. “On monetary policy this means that Banxico will very likely keep hiking with the US Fed.”\n\nStaying in line with Fed would also prevent the peso to depreciate, which would only further amplify external shocks to prices, the BofA economists wrote. The peso will likely continue to outperform many currencies around the world, they said.\n\nMEXICO INSIGHT: GDP Understates Strength in Economic Recovery\n\nMexico Finance Ministry’s priority is to keep a tight primary balance and debt to GDP in check, while continuing to support national oil producer Pemex with more capitalizations if needed, according to the BofA experts.\n\n©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",
    "Mexico should overturn mandatory pre-trial detention: UN experts": "GENEVA (5 September 2022) - The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention urgently calls on Mexico to abolish mandatory pre-trial detention, also known as “automatic preventive detention”, enshrined in the Constitution.\n\n“Mandatory pre-trial detention is contrary to international guarantees for human rights protection, as the jurisprudence of the Working Group has indicated on multiple occasions,’’ said Miriam Estrada-Castillo, the Working Group’s chair-rapporteur. The Inter-American Court and Commission on Human Rights, as well as the Human Rights Committee and the Committee against Torture, have adopted similar conclusions, the expert said.\n\nUnder article 19 of the Constitution, the Mexican legal system obliges judges to impose pre-trial detention on all persons accused of specific crimes, which has led to multiple violations of their fundamental human rights, such as the presumption of innocence, due process and equality before the law.\n\nMandatory pre-trial detention is also contrary to judicial independence and to the duty to legally motivate the reasons for the detention, Estrada-Castillo said. In addition, it seriously jeopardises the right to personal integrity and to not be at risk of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. Even if pre-trial automatic detention is established by law, this is not a guarantee that it is not arbitrary.\n\n“One of the most serious consequences of mandatory pre-trial detention has been that many Mexicans spend more than a decade deprived of their liberty, awaiting trial, without sentence and in conditions of serious risk to their lives and personal integrity. It also contributes to prison overcrowding,” Estrada-Castillo said.\n\nConscious of the public security challenges that the Government is facing, the Working Group reiterated that mandatory pre-trial detention places Mexico in violation of its international obligations undertaken with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\nOverturning automatic pre-trial detention not only is a key step to addressing the problem of arbitrary deprivation of liberty in Mexico, it will also help to reduce overpopulation in the penitentiary system.\n\nThe Working Group, since 2018, through its opinions and communications, has insisted to Mexico that it must urgently resolve this structural problem, repeatedly offering the necessary technical assistance to the Government.\n\nCurrently, Mexico has a historic opportunity to overturn a harmful measure that has hindered the fundamental rights of thousands of Mexicans for years.\n\nENDS\n\nThe Working Group on Arbitrary Detention was established by the former Commission on Human Rights in 1991 to investigate instances of alleged arbitrary deprivation of liberty. Its mandate was clarified and extended by the Commission to cover the issue of administrative custody of asylum-seekers and immigrants. In September 2019, the Human Rights Council confirmed the scope of the Working Group's mandate and extended it for a further three-year period. The Working Group is comprised of five independent expert members from various regions of the world: Ms. Miriam Estrada-Castillo (Ecuador; Chair-Rapporteur), Mr. Mumba Malila (Zambia; Vice-Chair); Ms. Elina Steinerte (Latvia); Ms. Priya Gopalan (Malaysia); and Mr. Matthew Gilllett (New Zealand).\n\nDatabase of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention.\n\nThe Working Group is part of what is known as the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council. Special Procedures, the largest body of independent experts in the UN Human Rights system, is the general name of the Council’s independent fact-finding and monitoring mechanisms that address either specific country situations or thematic issues in all parts of the world. Special Procedures’ experts work on a voluntary basis; they are not UN staff and do not receive a salary for their work. They are independent from any government or organization and serve in their individual capacity.",
    "Lady Pirates drop match against Mexico, 7-2 – Boonville Daily News": "The Boonville Lady Pirates tennis team fell to 2-7 on the season by losing to the Mexico Lady Bulldogs 7-2 Thursday night at the high school tennis courts.\n\nWhile the Lady Pirates picked up wins at No. 1 singles and No. 1 doubles against Mexico, head coach Melissa Harvey said the girls knew going into the match that Mexico would be a tough team to beat. “They have grown greatly as a team this season and the girls were prepared for tougher matches,” Harvey said. “Ever after all the tough losses this season, the girls continue to put forth their best effort and continue to show up every time with a positive attitude. For our senior night Monday, we’re looking forward to celebrating Emma (Neidig) and all her accomplishments the past four years.”\n\nAs for the two wins on the night, senior Emma Neidig improved to 16-2 on the season at No. 1 singles by beating Mexico’s Katherine Gooch 8-1. Meanwhile, at No. 1 doubles, the team of Neidig and Emily Baker won 8-5 over Katherine Gooch and Jyllian Whitworth to raise their season record to 9-3.\n\nHarvey said Neidig had solid playing time in the match against Lopez. “She had powerful serves and great ball placement,” Harvey said. “The opposing coach even commented that she looked like she was “in her prime” tonight. Emma has grown throughout the season. Hopefully, this momentum continues as districts are right around the corner.”\n\nIn other singles matches, Baker fell to Estrella Ramirez-Lopez 8-0 at the No. 2 position. At No. 3 singles, Georgia Hendrix lost to Jocelyn Jarquin-Garcia 8-1. At No. 4 singles, Paola Sanchez lost to Jyllian Whitworth 8-2. At No. 5 singles, Kaylee Casey lost to Lani Blair 8-0. Meanwhile, at No. 6 singles, Camrynn Hundley lost to Messiah Simpson 8-1.\n\nHarvey said despite Baker’s loss, the junior netter had fabulous movement. “Emily kept her feet going and was able to push the ball back,” Harvey said. “Unfortunately, she was unable to keep up with her opponent. During rallies after several hits, she would start to fall back into old habits and drop.”\n\nAs for Kendrix’s match, Harvey said Georgia was very tense. She said Hendrix was able to push the ball back but didn’t have the best form. “She needs to work on loosening her grip and having more fluid movement,” Harvey said. “She is one of the most positive players on the team and looks forward to learning and growing as a player.”\n\nHarvey also sees growth in Sanchez at the No. 3 singles position. She said Sanchez had long rallies with her opponent but struggled with her backhand. “Paola needs to work on getting her body turned so she is able to get her racket pulled back more,” Harvey said.\n\nAs for Casey, Harvey said Kaylee is still pushing through an injury that is affecting her movement on the court. “She struggled tonight with reaching instead of getting her feet to the ball,” Harvey said. “She is still making adjustments to her serve to be more consistent.”\n\nHarvey also complimented the play of Hundley, who came off the courts with a more positive attitude than in previous matches. She said Camrynn was able to pinpoint what she needs to work on. “We can make adjustments in practice,” Harvey said. “With her drive she is going to advance greatly as a player.”\n\nAs for the remaining two doubles matches for Boonville, the No. 2 team of Hendrix and Sanchez fell to Ramirez-Lopez and Jarquin-Garcia 8-2. Meanwhile, at No. 3 doubles, the team of Casey and Hundley lost to the team of Blair and Hudson 8-0.",
    "Mexico to hand army control of National Guard, sparking outcry": "Opposition lawmakers pledge to challenge contentious bill, which rights groups say gives too much power to the military.\n\nMexico’s Senate has passed legislation that would transfer control of the country’s National Guard over to the military, a contentious move that rights groups and opposition lawmakers say gives too much power to the armed forces and could lead to abuses.\n\nThe Senate’s 71-51 vote in favour of the bill on Friday comes after the lower house of Congress already approved the measure. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is expected to sign it into law.\n\nWhen the National Guard was created under a constitutional reform in 2019, it was placed under civilian control – but most of its training and recruitment has been done from within the country’s military.\n\nLopez Obrador, commonly referred to as AMLO, has waved aside concerns over the increased militarisation of public security, saying the guard must now be under military command to prevent corruption.\n\nBut opposition parties have said they plan to file court appeals challenging the new legislation, which they argue violates the Constitutional guarantee on civilian control.\n\n“Public safety is not achieved by violating the rule of law, by violating the Constitution,” said Senator Claudia Anaya Mota of the Institutional Revolutionary Party.\n\nThe Mexican military has been criticised for a record of abuses and rights groups have warned that removing civilian control over the National Guard could lead to similar violations.\n\n“We have already seen the disastrous results of the militarization of public security forces in Mexico over the last 16 years,” Edith Olivares Ferreto, executive director of Amnesty International Mexico, said in a statement on Friday, criticising the Senate’s decision.\n\n“We call on the executive branch to design a plan for the progressive withdrawal of the armed forces from the streets, prioritizing the strengthening of civilian police forces and the development of public prevention policies aimed at guaranteeing public safety.”\n\nNada Al-Nashif, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, also said that “the reforms effectively leave Mexico without a civilian police force at the federal level, and further consolidate the already prominent role of the armed forces in security in Mexico”.\n\n“The security forces should be subordinated under civilian authorities,” Al-Nashif said in a statement.\n\nBut Lopez Obrador on Friday lashed out at critics, including the United Nations.\n\n“When did the United Nations take a stand?” he said during a regular news conference, questioning what the body had done to prevent war from breaking out between Russia and Ukraine.\n\n“These organisations that supposedly defend human rights, almost all these organisations are made up of people on the right from different countries of the world … because they earn a lot of money for simulating, for pretending, for being go-betweens for authoritarian governments,” he said.\n\nMexico has seen record levels of violence in recent years, and members of the opposition and activists have accused the National Guard of various cases of abuse.\n\nThe ranks of the National Guard, made up of more than 110,000 members, are largely filled with members of the army and marines. Those officers retained their place in the military and were considered on loan to the guard.\n\nBefore coming to power in 2018, Lopez Obrador had pledged to send the military back to the barracks. But he has tasked them with a wide variety of assignments, including fighting drug cartels, helping with various infrastructure projects, such as a new airport in the capital, and building bank branches in rural areas.\n\nLate last month, a Truth Commission investigating the 2014 disappearance of 43 students said that six of the students were handed over to an army commander who ordered that they be killed. The shocking revelation directly tied the military to one of Mexico’s worst human rights scandals.",

He celebrated Mexico's identity, its culture, its indigenous people; he also acknowledged the challenges the country faces.\n\n\"Death to corruption, death to classism, death to racism!\" López Obrador said in Spanish. Responding to each phrase, the crowd shouted, \"Muera!\" (Die!)\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Eduardo Verdugo/AP Eduardo Verdugo/AP\n\nEstimates of the huge crowd's size varied. At one point, Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum said she was told 130,000 people were in the square; as the night crept into the early hours of Friday, she reported an even bigger number: 140,000.\n\nIt was Mexico's first full-fledged Independence Day celebration since the COVID-19 pandemic dampened 2020's event, and people responded with glee, wearing green, white and red paint and bushy fake mustaches.\n\nThe crowd braved periodic rainfall, rewarded with a concert by norteño legends Los Tigres del Norte.\n\nThe government issued a video of the celebration, showing a military honor guard presenting Mexico's tricolor flag to López Obrador, followed by his invocation to the crowd, the national anthem and a large fireworks show.\n\nYouTube\n\nAs is traditional, when the president finished his brief speech he repeatedly yanked on a long sash to ring a bell perched high in the palace's wall — the same church bell the priest Miguel Hidalgo rang 212 years ago in the town of Dolores, signaling the start of the war against Spain and the fight for Mexico's future.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alfredo Estrella/AFP via Getty Images Alfredo Estrella/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe festivities extended beyond Mexico City and Mexico's borders.

    "Rapid vertical exchange at fronts in the Northern Gulf of Mexico": "SUNRISE campaign 2021\n\nCharacterizing the fronts on the Texas-Louisiana shelf and their vertical circulation is one of the goals of SUNRISE. In the summer of 2021, a multi-platform field campaign was conducted on the Texas-Louisiana shelf. During the period from June 23 to 28, several wind events energized near-inertial oscillations in the ocean (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Material). Over the shelf, the Mississippi/Atchafalaya river outflow creates a large plume of fresh water and a rich field of eddies and fronts develops as a result. A plume front was captured by high-frequency, repeated profiling transects conducted by R/Vs Pelican and Walton Smith which were run in parallel lines separated by ~1 km. A snapshot of the plume front (characterized by the high concentration of chlorophyll) and the ship tracks are shown in Fig. 2a. The observations revealed strong frontal convergence and divergence, the downward vertical transport of warm surface waters (through a process known as subduction) on the leading edge of the front, and upwelling of cool waters on its trailing edge.\n\nIsopycnals near the surface converge approximately every inertial period, when the plume front propagates offshore. Here, we focus on the front observed on June 24. From 03:00 to 07:00 UTC, the plume front propagates into the sampling region, which is indicated by the strong surface buoyancy gradients at the middle of the transects (e.g., the subpanel in Fig. 2a). Strong near-surface convergence was found at the head of the front, suggesting intense downward motions beneath the front (Fig. 2b). As observed on both R/Vs, the isopycnals beneath the leading edge of the front are depressed due to downward advection of buoyant water, which is evidenced by the shock-like jumps in the density fields (Fig. 2e, f). In addition, strong near-surface convergence was found at the head of the front, suggesting intense downwelling beneath the front (Fig. 2b). The appearance of streamers of warm water on the leading edge of the front that follow isopycnals is strongly suggestive of active subduction of surface waters at the front (Fig. 2e, f). In contrast, the near-surface flow is divergent on the light side of the front (Fig. 2b) which presumably drives the upward motions that occur there, as evidenced by the intrusions of cooler water (e.g., Fig. 2f). Such upwelling motions are also evidenced by the intrusion of bottom waters with lower oxygen and higher turbidity on the transects made on June 23 and 25 (see Fig. S3 and S4 of the supplementary material).\n\nDiurnal convergence at fronts\n\nA triple-nested model is configured to simulate the frontal vertical circulations on the Texas-Louisiana shelf and understand their governing physics (Fig. 1a; see Methods for details). Over the shelf, a rich field of eddies and fronts develops due to the Mississippi/Atchafalaya river outflow (Fig. 3a, b). In addition, the prominent wind variability in the summertime is often a diurnal land-sea breeze. An example of the land-sea breeze is shown in Fig. 3d. The breeze resonantly excites strong near-inertial oscillations in the ocean (oscillatory flows where the Coriolis force acts as the sole restoring force for their motions). In the absence of background currents, inertial oscillations are non-divergent in the lateral direction. However, in the presence of the plume fronts, the oscillations interact with the fronts and display convergent features, leading to strong vertical motions at the front.\n\nFig. 3: Diurnal convergence at fronts. a Surface normalized relative vorticity (ζ/f), where ζ = ∂v/∂x − ∂u/∂y. b Surface density. Isobaths are contoured in gray. The white box denotes the L3 domain. c Surface normalized divergence (δ/f) binned as a function of ζ/f and time.

Full size image\n\nThe plume fronts coincide with filaments with strong positive relative vorticity, while the plume eddies are characterized by negative relative vorticity (Fig. 3a, b). Given these characteristics, the horizontal divergence associated with the fronts and eddies can be distinguished from one another by calculating the divergence as a function of vorticity using surface fields taken from the entire numerical domain. The statistics of the divergence shown in Fig. 3c demonstrates that horizontal convergence (blue colors) primarily occurs in fronts and varies near-inertially with the sea-breeze.\n\nThe near-surface inertial/diurnal horizontal convergence at the fronts can induce downward motions at depth. The convergence at the surface across the front is found to be very strong, for example at x ≈ 16 km for the section shown in Fig. 3f. This strongly convergent surface flow draws together isopycnal surfaces and induces downward motions which advect the buoyant surface water downwards and contributes to the depression of isopycnals beneath the leading edge of the front, a feature that is seen in the observations (cf. Figs. 2f and 3g). In addition to the convergence on the frontal edge, the flow at the light side of the front is divergent, resembling the observations (cf. Figs. 2b and 3h), and could potentially drive upward motions.\n\nSlantwise vertical exchange at fronts\n\nEvidence of subduction can be seen in the distribution of the temperature field near the fronts. The density of the sea water on the Texas-Louisiana self shelf is largely dependent on salinity with a lower-water column thermocline contributing to stratification differences in the summer5. Consequently, temperature becomes an ideal tracer to identify surface waters because it tags waters warmed by solar radiation. The simulation reveals a streamer of warm water subducting into the interior beneath the front, which resembles the observed fields (cf. Figs. 4b and 2e, f). A Lagrangian analysis was used to confirm that the warm waters at depth originated from the surface. Namely, Lagrangian, or water-following floats were seeded in the simulation at the head of the warm-water streamer (the dots in Fig. 4b) and advected backwards in time to determine their origin. This Lagrangian analysis reveals that the floats came from near the surface and subducted a distance of about 10 m in a few hours, indicating rapid vertical transport (Fig. 4f). To illustrate the spatial structure of the subduction, floats were uniformly released at the surface of the frontal region (marked in Fig. 4h) and then tracked forward in time. As the floats approach the front, they are rapidly subducted beneath the front, showing a fairly uniform subduction zone along the front (Fig. 4h). The subduction has an along-isopycnal nature connecting the surface to the interior, which is different from other turbulent processes in surface mixed layers, such as breaking of surface gravity waves, convective instabilities, and shear instabilities.\n\nFig. 4: Slantwise vertical exchange at fronts. a–d Across-front sections of dissolved oxygen, temperature, potential vorticity, and viscosity. The sections are made at June 14, 2010 00:00 UTC along the orange line marked in Fig. 3e. e Time series of float depth colored by dissolved oxygen concentration. The floats are initially released at the positions marked by the upper gray dots in a and backward tracked in time. The Lagrangian rate of change of oxygen near the surface is estimated as dO/dt ≈ 0.82 mg L−1 day−1. This rate of oxygenation is obtained by averaging the rates of all the floats over the last 4 h. f Same as e but for the lower floats marked in a, b. g Distance above bottom of floats 30 h after release. The floats are initially and uniformly released in a 10 m-thick bottom boundary layer within the red dashed box at June 13, 2010 06:00 UTC. h Float depth 12 h after release. The floats are initially and uniformly released at the surface within the green dashed box at June 13, 2010 12:00 UTC. Isopycnals are contoured every 0.2 kg/m3 in gray in a–d and g, h. All the calculations are from the L3 solution. Full size image\n\nUpwelling of bottom waters on the lighter side of the front accompanies the subduction of surface waters on the denser side of the front. This is particularly evident in the oxygen field. In the simulation, a bottom boundary layer with lower oxygen concentration compared to the overlying water is reproduced (details of the oxygen model are described in the Methods section), and hence oxygen is a particularly good tracer for identifying bottom waters (Fig. 4a). Interestingly, the water with lower oxygen seems to intrude upward along the tilted isopycnals near the front (Fig. 4a). To certify the path of the intrusion, 3D Lagrangian floats are released at the tongue of the water with lower oxygen (denoted in Fig. 4a) and then tracked backward in time. The time series of the float depth shows that the floats at the tongue are raised about 10 m in 18 h (Fig. 4e), indicating that the near-surface water with lower oxygen certainly originates from a deeper depth. To illustrate the spatial structure of the intrusion, floats are uniformly released in a 10 m thick bottom boundary layer in the frontal region (marked in Fig. 4g) and then tracked forward in time. The floats are raised from the bottom boundary layer quite uniformly at the light side of the front (Fig. 4g), consistent with the intrusion of water with lower oxygen shown in Figs. 4a and 2b. Although the freshwater input from the Mississippi/Atchafalaya River generally suppresses ventilation of bottom waters by creating a strongly stratified layer, the exchange of water along isopycnals near the plume fronts serves as a ventilating channel of the bottom oxygen-deficient water over the Texas-Louisiana shelf that can bypass the plume’s stratification barrier. This slantwise vertical exchange at fronts contributes a ventilation mechanism among other mechanisms related to bottom boundary layer dynamics6.\n\nA third tracer that evidences slantwise vertical exchange at the fronts is the potential vorticity (PV). The PV, defined here as \\(q=(f\\hat{z}+\n\nabla \\times {{{{{{{\\bf{u}}}}}}}})\\cdot\n\nabla b\\) (\\(\\hat{z}\\) is the unit vector in the vertical direction, u is the velocity, b = − gρ/ρ o is the buoyancy, g is the acceleration due to gravity and ρ, ρ o is the density and a reference density, respectively) is a measure of the stability of the flow. Namely, large positive values of the PV indicate stable flow and strong stratification, while negative values of the PV mark a flow that is unstable to submesoscale instabilities which can drive vertical exchange7,8. The structure of the PV field near the front looks remarkably similar to that of the temperature and oxygen fields (Fig. 4a–c), with high values of the PV (associated with the strongly-stratified bottom waters) being drawn up to the surface from the bottom in the plumes of waters with cooler temperature and lower oxygen. Conversely, water with low to negative PV is subducted from the surface ahead of the leading edge of the front along with the warmer, oxygenated waters. The PV inferred from the observations made from the two ships (see Methods for the calculation detail) shows a similar correlation between the PV and temperature fields (cf. Fig. 2d, f), suggesting that related PV dynamics are at play in the observed and simulated fronts.\n\nThe resemblances in the PV, temperature, and oxygen fields highlight the conservative nature of these three tracers. Having said this, the Lagrangian time evolution of the PV, as measured by the PV interpolated to the positions of the floats that were seeded into the bottom waters (colors in Fig. S5B of the supplementary material), show that the PV is conserved only until the water reaches the surface layer, at which point the PV is rapidly reduced and in fact changes sign. These floats upwell on the isopycnals that outcrop at the front, where the PV is negative in the surface boundary layer (Figs. 4c and 5b). Here non-conservative effects, namely friction and diabatic processes conspire to change the PV by inducing a positive vertical PV flux, J z , at the sea surface that extracts PV from the ocean and hence reduces the PV in the boundary layer (e.g., Fig. 5c and Fig. S6 in the supplementary material where J z is defined and broken down into its frictional and diabatic components). At fronts forced by winds, the surface PV flux scales with the Ekman buoyancy flux, EBF ≡ M e ⋅ ∇ h b, where M e is the Ekman transport, which measures the tendency for wind-forced surface flows to advect denser waters over light and destabilize the water column8,9. The EBF at the front oscillates in time due to both the variation in the wind-driven flow and the strength of the front (Fig. S7c in the supplementary material). Expressed in terms of an equivalent heat flux, the EBF can reach values approaching 20,000 W m−2 of heat loss in the center of the front. Such intense values of the EBF were also inferred from the observations (Fig. 2c) and suggest that the surface boundary layer at the front is a hot spot for irreversible mixing.\n\nFig. 5: Inertially modulated frontogenesis and convergence. a Time series of the surface wind stress over the L3 domain. b Surface PV (color), wind stress (vectors) and density (contours) that are averaged between 06/12 12:00 and 06/15 12:00 UTC. c Hovmöller diagrams of surface normalized divergence (δ/f), horizontal buoyancy gradient squared (1/2∣∇ h b∣2), and PV flux (J z ), which are calculated along the orange line in b (the same line in Fig. 3e). d Comparison between the wind stress \\({\\tau }_{y}^{w}\\) and minus the geostrophic stress \\({\\tau }_{y}^{g}\\) at the front over one inertial period. \\({\\tau }_{y}^{g}\\) and \\({\\tau }_{y}^{w}\\) are averaged over a front-following section (the first 2 km of the magenta section in e). e Across-front ageostrophic velocity u ag . The velocity is averaged over the top 5 m. The snapshot is taken at 06/14 18:00 UTC (marked by the arrow in f). Two front-following sections are plotted for each side of the front. f Velocity evolution over one inertial period on the dense side of the front. The left subpanel shows one inertial cycle of u ml that is obtained from the slab mixed layer model. The right subpanel is a Hovmöller diagram of u ag along the blue line in e. g Velocity evolution over one inertial period on the light side of the front. The left subpanel is a Hovmöller diagram of u ag along the magenta line in e. The right subpanel is a similar diagram but for \\({u}_{ag}^{\\prime}\\) that is obtained from the reduced physics model. The gray dashed box between f and g marks the phase when the across-front velocities run opposite on either side of the front and lead to convergence. The gray box in g marks the phase with divergence on the light side of the front. The distance in the Hovmöller diagrams in f and g are front-relative with negative (positive) values on the dense (light) side. The gray contours in b, c, e are isopycnals made every 0.2 kg/m3. All calculations are made from the L3 solution. Full size image\n\nThe oxygen on the floats, like the PV, experiences similar rapid Lagrangian variations in the surface boundary layer, but in this case increasing as the fluid approaches the oxygenated surface ocean (Fig. 4e). In this way, by bringing bottom waters to the surface, the slantwise, along-isopycnal motions at the front can lead to irreversible changes in water properties, and drive a net oxygenation of the bottom waters and a reduction in the PV and stratification of the water column. The rate of oxygenation during these pulses of upwelling is estimated based on Lagrangian particle tracking as 0.82 mg L−1 day−1 (Fig. 4e), which is comparable to the rate of deoxygenation due to aerobic respiration of organic matter during the summertime in the Gulf of Mexico10. In the next section we explore the mechanisms that force the vertical motions at the front.\n\nInertially modulated convergence and frontogenesis\n\nThe vertical motions at the front are ultimately associated with convergences and divergences in the near-surface horizontal flow. Understanding the processes that drive these convergences/divergences is thus key to unlocking the underlying physics of the vertical exchange at the fronts. As emphasized above, the convergence varies inertially and hence must be linked to the wind-forced inertial motions. However, in the absence of a background current, such motions inherit the horizontal scales of the winds, which on the shelf are too broad to explain the narrow convergence lines seen in the simulations, suggesting wave-mean flow interaction at the front as the cause of the convergence. By comparing the results from a reduced physics model that retains select terms in the equations of motion to the full solution from the simulations, we were able to isolate the key wave-mean flow interaction that is responsible for the inertially-modulated convergence at the fronts.\n\nThe reduced physics model accounts for wind-forcing, the Coriolis force, the pressure gradient force at the front, mixing of momentum by turbulence, and accelerations, but not nonlinear advection of momentum in the equations of motion (namely, it is a variant of the so-called turbulent thermal wind balance, e.g., ref. 11, that allows for accelerations but it does not account for modifications of the inertial motions by vorticity; see the Methods section for the details of the reduced physics model). In spite of the model simplification, the model captures the features in the cross-front velocity that lead to the inertially-modulated convergence (cf. the two panels in Fig. 5g). Here, we highlight a period of strong convergence around 6/14 18:00 associated with the sharp reversal in the cross-front velocity within the front relative to outside of the front (e.g., Fig. 5e, g for cross-front distances less than 3 km and before 6/14 21:00). The elevated turbulent viscosity at the front indicates that the mixing of the geostrophic momentum could play an important role in driving ageostrophic frontal circulations (Fig. 4d). The reduced physics model reveals that the flow reversal is caused by mixing of the geostrophic flow, which disrupts the geostrophic balance and accelerates an ageostrophic flow u ag < 0 that streams water down the pressure gradient at the front. Mixing of geostrophic momentum is quantified by the “geostrophic stress”, \\({{{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{\\tau }}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{{{\\bf{g}}}}}}}}}=-{\\rho }_{o}\n\nu \\hat{z}\\times {\n\nabla }_{h}b/f\\) (ν is the turbulent viscosity)12. A time series of the geostrophic stress evaluated on the light side of the front demonstrates how reversals in the ageostrophic flow follow the peaks in ∣τ g ∣ (cf. Fig. 5d, g) which in turn coincide with the maxima in the turbulent viscosity (e.g., Fig. S7b in the supplementary material). These maxima in ν occur during periods when the EBF is positive and wind-driven surface flows destabilize the water column and enhance mixing (e.g., Fig. S7c in the supplementary material).\n\nOn the dense side of the front the winds drive an oscillatory, ageostrophic flow that tracks the phasing of a slab mixed layer model (an even simpler reduced physics model that only accounts for wind-forcing, the Coriolis force, and accelerations; see the Methods section for the details), cf. the two panels in Fig. 5f. The ageostrophic flows on either side of the front thus follow different physics and have periods when they are opposing (e.g., between 15:00-21:00 on 6/14). This results in strong, diurnal convergence (δ/f < −5) at the front (Fig. 5c). The near-surface convergence leads to frontogenesis as it intensifies the lateral buoyancy gradient, ∇ h b, and cyclonic vorticity (ζ > 0) of the front, which is likewise modulated over an inertial period (Fig. 5c). Based on this analysis we conclude that this inertial modulation of the convergence and frontogenesis is ultimately attributable to periodic mixing of the geostrophic flow at the front caused by the diurnally-varying winds. Similar diurnal variations in frontogenesis have been modeled for fronts forced by diurnal heating and cooling which can induce variations in viscosity akin to the wind-driven modulations in turbulence emphasized here13,14.\n\nThe reversal of the ageostrophic flow at the front also leads to divergence on the light edge of the front (e.g., Fig. 5c, g between 2–3 km). The pattern of near-surface convergence and divergence on the dense and light sides of the front should set up a vertical circulation with downwelling and upwelling, respectively. Furthermore, theory predicts that overturning motions forced by near-surface convergence/divergence at fronts should be slantwise, with streamlines that tend to run parallel to isopycnals15,16, which is entirely consistent with the behavior of the tracer fields and Lagrangian floats seen in the simulation. A schematic highlighting the key elements contributing to the vertical circulation at the front is shown in Fig. 6.",

What?” Black said. “I don’t really know what’s going on, but I also don’t want to look stupid again in front of the world.

And then I realise that my entire family was just scammed by this distant relative who worked for his presidential campaign”.\n\nWhile in office, Nieto was accused of plagiarising his law thesis and criticised for his leadership.\n\nIn August of this year, Mexico’s Attorney General’s Office opened several lines of investigation against the former president, several weeks after the country’s anti-money laundering agency accused the former leader of handling millions of dollars in possibly illegal funds.",
    "Union victory at Teksid Mexico": "22 September, 2022Workers at Teksid Hierro in Mexico have re-elected the Los Mineros union as the holder of the collective bargaining agreement at the company, ending an eight-year long conflict over union representation.\n\nLos Mineros, affiliated to IndustriALL Global union, won a resounding victory when almost 80 per cent of Teksid Hierro workers voted in favour of it being the sole legal representative of the collective bargaining agreement at the company.\n\nThe results of the vote were published on 20 September, Mexico's National Day of Trade Union Democracy. The day before, workers had been able to exercise their right to freedom of association and vote freely, secretly and directly on which union to represent them.\n\n642 votes were in favour of Los Mineros, with only 172 in favour of the CTM union and two invalid votes. The counting of votes was carried out in the presence of representatives of the two participating unions, the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Board (JFCA) and a representative from the National Human Rights Commission.\n\n“This manifestation of the comrades at the ballot box is a conclusive and definitive proof of the firm conviction that the Mineros (Section 327) is the holder of the collective bargaining agreement. “This vote and the results obtained put an end to a long struggle of uncertainty, violations of trade union freedom (...) A further step towards the transformation of the trade union world is guaranteed, the company and employers' structure that prevented and limited trade union action has been dismantled,\"\n\nLos Mineros said in a statement.\n\nSince 2014, Los Mineros' attempts to establish a democratic workplace union have been met with unionbusting.\n\nA first ballot was held in 2018, where workers elected Los Mineros as their sole legal representative of the workers' collective bargaining agreement at Teksid. However, it was only in July 2022 that the company signed an agreement recognizing the victory of Los Mineros. This agreement was made possible by invoking the Rapid Response Labour Mechanism (RRM) of the Mexico-United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement (T-MEC).\n\nAnd yet, the Sindicato de Trabajadores de la Industria Metal-Mecánica del Estado (STIMME, of the Confederación de Trabajadores de México, CTM) ignored the agreement and asked the JFCA for a new vote to decide which union would represent workers at the Teksid plant.\n\n\"This vote for freedom of association not only concludes an eight-year long struggle, but is also a good example of international cooperation and solidarity,\"\n\nsays IndustriALL automotive sector director Georg Leutert.",

    "Feature: Mexico may squeeze itself out of global lithium rush": "Mexico's nationalization of its untapped lithium resources has created uncertainty in the global hunt for new sources of the battery metal and could end up costing the country.\n\nNot registered? Receive daily email alerts, subscriber notes & personalize your experience. Register Now\n\nThe country hosts the 10th-largest lithium resource globally at 1.7 million mt, according to the US Geological Survey.\n\nIn April, Mexico passed a law to nationalize its lithium, paving the way for the establishment of a state-owned lithium company called Litio para Mexico, or Lithium for Mexico, four months later on Aug. 23 through a decree issued by President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. The cash-strapped government hopes that taking control of its lithium can pay for new spending, but it has so far released few details on how far it will intervene in the market or how private companies can participate in the country's lithium sector.\n\nAnalysts told S&P Global Commodity Insights this uncertainty may prevent Mexico from becoming an important lithium producer at a time when the world is scrambling for new supplies amid rising demand for electric vehicles.\n\n\"A lack of clarity regarding the operations of the state-owned lithium company ... will likely delay the creation of a profitable lithium industry in Mexico,\" Cecily Fasanella said in an email. Fasanella is the program coordinator at the Mexico Institute of Washington-based think tank Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.\n\nThe missing information\n\nLitio para Mexico is expected to hold the exclusive rights to exploit the country's lithium resources. The company is scheduled to start operations within the next six months, but the government has yet to establish rules on how it will manage existing concessions and hand out new concessions.\n\nThe president also vowed that lithium exploration in Mexico would only be used for national development, joining the new wave of resource nationalism sweeping Latin America. Mexico is working with Argentina, Bolivia and Chile, countries that make up the so-called Lithium Triangle in South America, to form a lithium association where they can collaborate on developing new technologies to exploit the commodity.\n\nLópez Obrador has not entirely dismissed the possibility of partnering with the private sector, given the country's lack of experience in the lithium sector, but miners have little sense of how they would be allowed to operate.\n\nPrivate sector peeved\n\nAllowing Litio para Mexico to dominate the domestic industry would likely deter private companies from investing.\n\n\"If the state-owned lithium company has a strong monopoly with little regulatory oversight, private sector investors will likely be discouraged from entering this multibillion-dollar market,\" Fasanella said.\n\nIn April, some business groups, including the Mexican branch of the International Chamber of Commerce and the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, flagged the law's potential conflict with Mexico's global trade obligations.\n\nThe groups said Mexico is party to certain trade pacts that prohibit new restrictions on sectors that were not previously reserved to the state.\n\nFasanella expressed doubts about whether, without the help of the private sector, Litio para Mexico could commence mining activities before the end of López Obrador's term in 2024, given the state of the country's finances.\n\nMexico needs foreign expertise. Lithium is mainly produced from brines and hard-rock deposits using conventional methods, but Mexico's lithium is typically found in clay deposits, for which extraction technologies are still being developed.\n\n\"This industry is capital intensive and requires innovative technology,\" Miguel Angel Marmolejo Cervantes, a professor at the Autonomous University of Nuevo León in Mexico, said in an email.\n\nAlbemarle, Allkem and Livent, all of which have invested in other Latin American countries, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe exception\n\nWhen López Obrador signed the law taking control of domestic lithium, he called for a review of all lithium concessions that were previously granted, including one owned by an unnamed Chinese company. China-based Ganfeng Lithium had also just taken complete control of the Sonora project, the world's 14th-largest lithium project based on primary reserves and resources, and Mexico's largest, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data.\n\nIn June, López Obrador softened his stance on Ganfeng, saying the government will respect the company's Sonora project. The company did not respond to S&P Global's request for comment.\n\nThe possible delay in Mexico's lithium development could hamper an already tight lithium market that faces a supply deficit for the years to come. The global supply gap for lithium carbonate equivalent is expected to reach 39,000 mt by 2026 from a projected surplus of 1,000 mt in 2022, according to Market Intelligence forecasts.\n\nS&P Global Commodity Insights reporter Karl Decena writes for S&P Capital IQ Pro.
