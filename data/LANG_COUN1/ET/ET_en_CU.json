    "Cuba overwhelmingly approves same-sex marriage in referendum": "New code also would allow surrogate pregnancies, broader rights for grandparents and measures against gender violence.\n\nCubans have overwhelmingly approved a sweeping ‚Äúfamily law‚Äù that would allow same-sex couples to marry and adopt, the electoral commission said, in a move that will also redefine rights for children and grandparents.\n\nMore than 3.9 million voters ‚Äì 66.9 percent ‚Äì voted to ratify the new code while 1.95 million or 33 percent were opposed, National Electoral Council President Alina Balseiro Gutierrez said on state-run television on Monday.\n\nThe 100-page ‚Äúfamily code‚Äù legalises same-sex marriage and civil unions, allows same-sex couples to adopt children, and promotes equal sharing of domestic rights and responsibilities between men and women.\n\nPreliminary results from the electoral commission showed 74 percent of 8.4 million Cubans eligible to vote participated in the Sunday referendum.\n\n‚ÄúLove is now the law,‚Äù President Miguel Diaz-Canel wrote on Twitter on Monday morning.\n\n‚ÄúIt is paying off a debt with several generations of Cuban men and women, whose family projects have been waiting for this law for years,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAs of today, we will be a better nation.‚Äù\n\nGan√≥ el S√≠. Se ha hecho justicia. Aprobar el #C√≥digoDeLasFamilias es hacer justicia. Es saldar una deuda con varias generaciones de cubanas y cubanos, cuyos proyectos de familia llevan a√±os esperando por esta Ley. A partir de hoy seremos una naci√≥n mejor. #ElAmorYaEsLey ‚ù§Ô∏èüá®üá∫ pic.twitter.com/O5o0Hi2cm1 ‚Äî Miguel D√≠az-Canel Berm√∫dez (@DiazCanelB) September 26, 2022\n\nTranslation: Yes has won. Justice has been done. To approve the Family code is to do justice. It is paying off a debt with several generations of Cuban men and women, whose family projects have been waiting for this law for years. As of today, we will be a better nation.\n\nThe reforms had met unusually strong open resistance from a growing evangelical movement in Cuba ‚Äî and many other Cubans ‚Äî despite an extensive government campaign in favour of the measure.\n\nThat push included thousands of informative meetings across the country and extensive media coverage backing it.\n\nCuban elections, in which no party other than the Communist is allowed, routinely produce victory margins of more than 90 percent ‚Äî as did a referendum on a major constitutional reform in 2019.\n\nThe ‚Äúfamily law‚Äù measure had been approved by Cuba‚Äôs parliament, the National Assembly, after years of debate about such reforms.\n\nIt would allow surrogate pregnancies, broader rights for grandparents in regard to grandchildren, protection of the elderly and measures against gender violence.\n\nDiaz-Canel, who has promoted the law, acknowledged questions about the measure as he voted on Sunday. ‚ÄúMost of our people will vote in favour of the code, but it still has issues that our society as a whole does not understand,‚Äù he said.\n\nA major supporter of the measure was Mariela Castro, director of the National Center for Sex Education and a promoter of rights for same-sex couples. She is the daughter of former President Raul Castro and the niece of his brother, Cuban leader Fidel Castro.\n\nBut there is a strong strain of social conservatism in Cuba and several religious leaders have expressed concern or opposition to the law, worrying it could weaken nuclear families.\n\nWhile Cuba was officially atheist for decades after the 1959 revolution led by Fidel Castro, it has become more tolerant of religions over the past quarter century.\n\nThat has meant a greater opening not only to the once-dominant Roman Catholic Church, but also to Afro-Cuban religions, protestants and Muslims.\n\nSome of those churches took advantage of the opening in 2018 and 2019 to campaign against another plebiscite that would have rewritten the constitution in a way to allow gay marriage.\n\nOpposition was strong enough that the government at that time backed away.",
    "Ian Strengthens into Hurricane, Heads Toward Cuba, Florida": "Forecasters say Tropical Storm Ian has strengthened into a hurricane as it moves closer to Cuba on a track expected to take it to Florida in the coming days.\n\nIan was forecast to intensify rapidly and become a major hurricane as soon as late Monday.\n\nAuthorities in Cuba suspended classes in Pinar del Rio province and said they will begin evacuations Monday as Ian was forecast to strengthen before reaching the western part of the island on its way to Florida.\n\nA hurricane warning was in effect for Grand Cayman and the Cuban provinces of Isla de Juventud, Pinar del Rio and Artemisa. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Ian should reach the far-western part of Cuba late Monday or early Tuesday, hitting near the country's most famed tobacco fields. It could become a major hurricane before a likely landfall in Florida around the middle of the week, possibly the state's western coast or Panhandle\n\nCuba state media outlet Granma said authorities would begin evacuating people from vulnerable areas early Monday in the far-western province of Pinar del Rio.\n\nAt 5 a.m. EDT on Monday, Ian was moving northwest at 13 mph (20 kph), about 150 kilometers southwest of Grand Cayman, according to the center. It had maximum sustained winds of 120 kph.\n\nMeanwhile, residents in Florida were keeping a cautious eye on Ian as it rumbled ominously through the Caribbean on a path toward the state.\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis has declared a state of emergency throughout Florida and urged residents to prepare for the storm to lash large swaths of the state with heavy rains, high winds and rising seas.\n\n\"We're going to keep monitoring the track of this storm. But it really is important to stress the degree of uncertainty that still exists,\" DeSantis said at a news conference Sunday, cautioning that \"even if you're not necessarily right in the eye of the path of the storm, there's going to be pretty broad impacts throughout the state.\"\n\nFlash and urban flooding is possible in the Florida Keys and Florida peninsula through midweek, and then heavy rainfall was possible for north Florida, the Florida panhandle and the southeast United States later this week.\n\nThe agency placed a tropical storm watch over the lower Florida Keys on Sunday evening and has advised Floridians to have hurricane plans in place and monitor updates of the storm's evolving path.\n\nPresident Joe Biden also declared an emergency, authorizing the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, to coordinate disaster relief and provide assistance to protect lives and property. The president postponed a scheduled Sept. 27 trip to Florida because of the storm.\n\nJohn Cangialosi, a senior hurricane specialist at the Miami-based center, said in an interview Sunday that it is not clear exactly where Ian will hit hardest in Florida. Residents should begin preparations, including gathering supplies for potential power outages, he said.\n\n\"It's a hard thing to say stay tuned, but that's the right message right now,\" Cangialosi said \"But for those in Florida, it's still time to prepare. I'm not telling you to put up your shutters yet or do anything like that, but it's still time to get your supplies.\"\n\nLocal media in Florida have reported a consumer rush on water, generators and other supplies in some areas where residents moved to stock up on goods ahead of the storm.",
    "Pandemic worsened inequalities, exposed true essence of unjust global order, Cuba tells UN": "‚ÄúNever has humankind had this wealth of scientific and technical potential that it has now, neither has it ever had the extraordinary capacity than it does now to create wealth and well-being,‚Äù he said on Wednesday, but added: ‚ÄúHowever, never has the world been so unequal in terms of just how much people suffer.‚Äù\n\nHe pointed to some grim figures, including that some 828 million people are going hungry, around 50 million children suffer from stunting and unemployment will affect 207 million persons in 2022.\n\nTrillions in military spending while vaccines remain scarce\n\nHe went on to note that around 6.5 million people have died because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and vaccinations to tackle this crisis are inaccessible to billions of people in low-income countries.\n\nReferring to global military expenditures, which have grown at a dizzying pace and for the first time now exceeds $2 trillion dollars, and while championing the universalization of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, he raised the question of how much more could be done if these resources were devoted to promoting health and development, how many lives could be saved.\n\nTalking about the climate crisis, the Cuban Foreign Minister remarked, ‚Äúwe have one planet earth, one common home, for the rich and the poor, we must act without delay.‚Äù\n\nEconomic war against Cuba\n\nIn sharing his observation that international relations are moving along a dangerous path, he decried the United States for its offensive of economic, military, political and diplomatic coercion.\n\nRecalling the General Assembly‚Äôs adoption of the first resolution to end the embargo against Cuba 30 years ago, he denounced the US for the ‚Äúact of economic war in times of peace,‚Äù for ignoring the resolution, creating material shortages, pressuring banking institutions and damaging the Cuban people.\n\nCriticizing the ‚Äúunfair inclusion‚Äù and ‚Äúslanderous classification‚Äù of Cuba as a sponsor of terrorism when Cuba ‚Äúhas been a victim of state terrorism‚Äù, he called out the US for its double standards, inconsistency, selectivity and manipulation including on human rights.\n\nReferring to the colossal challenges that face the Cuban people and government, he said ‚Äúthe Cuban economy has withstood extraordinary pressure which is having an impact on industry service provision, leading to scarcity in food and medicine, and leading to a decline in consumption and thus resulting in a decline in the general well-being of our people. The human damage caused by this policy is impossible to quantify but is nevertheless vast, cruel and immoral.‚Äù\n\nUrging the US to address the issues fueling irregular migration, he commended the return of visa processing at the US embassy in Havana and reiterated Cuba‚Äôs readiness to move towards better relations with the US but only based on mutual respect, sovereign equality and no attempts at undermining sovereignty and independence.\n\nSolidarity with others\n\nThe Foreign Minister shared that at the worst moments of the pandemic, Cuba was able to send 58 medical brigades to some 48 countries. He went on to express solidarity with the governments of Venezuela and Nicaragua, support for Caribbean nations‚Äô claims for reparations for the slave trade and colonialism, reaffirmed Cuba‚Äôs commitment to independence of Puerto Rico and reconstruction of Haiti.\n\nMr. Bruno Rodr√≠guez reiterated Cuba‚Äôs staunch commitment to peace in Colombia, an end to foreign interference in Syria, and a just and lasting solution to the Middle East conflict. He also called for an end of the Israel occupation of the Palestinian territories.\n\nHe concluded by turning to Ukraine and said that the realistic solution to the war must guarantee the security and sovereignty of all. He said, ‚ÄúCuba will continue to speak out loud and clear to reject hegemonism and domination, unilateral coercive measure, genocide blockades and attempts to impose one culture and one model on the world.‚Äù",

    "Hurricane Ian nears Cuba on path to strike Florida as Cat 4": "HAVANA (AP) ‚Äî Hurricane Ian was growing stronger as it approached the western tip of Cuba on a track to hit the west coast of Florida as a major hurricane as early as Wednesday.\n\nIan was forecast to hit the western tip of Cuba as a major hurricane and then become an even stronger Category 4 with top winds of 140 mph (225 km/h) over warm Gulf of Mexico waters before striking Florida.\n\nAs of Monday, Tampa and St. Petersburg appeared to be the among the most likely targets for their first direct hit by a major hurricane since 1921.\n\n‚ÄúPlease treat this storm seriously. It‚Äôs the real deal. This is not a drill,‚Äù Hillsborough County Emergency Management Director Timothy Dudley said at a news conference on storm preparations in Tampa.\n\nAuthorities in Cuba evacuated 50,000 people in Pinar del Rio province, sent in medical and emergency personnel, and took steps to protect food and other crops in warehouses, according to state media.\n\n‚ÄúCuba is expecting extreme hurricane-force winds, also life threatening storm surge and heavy rainfall,‚Äù U.S. National Hurricane Center senior specialist Daniel Brown told The Associated Press early Monday.\n\nHere are the 11am EDT Monday 26 September Key Messages for Hurricane #Ian.\n\n\n\nLatest Advisory: https://t.co/tnOTyfOjMY pic.twitter.com/3yeYqkQCxe ‚Äî National Hurricane Center (@NHC_Atlantic) September 26, 2022\n\nThe hurricane center predicted areas of Cuba‚Äôs western coast could see as much as 14 feet (4.3 meters) of storm surge Monday night or early Tuesday.\n\nIn Havana, fishermen were taking their boats out of the water along the famous Malecon, the seaside boardwalk, and city workers were busy unclogging storm drains ahead of the expected rain.\n\nHavana resident Adyz Ladron, 35, said the potential for rising water from the storm worries him.\n\n‚ÄúI am very scared because my house gets completely flooded, with water up to here,‚Äù he said, pointing to his chest.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Ian was moving northwest at 13 mph (20 km/h), about 195 miles (310 kilometers) southeast of the western tip of Cuba, with top sustained winds increasing to 85 mph (135 km/h).\n\nThe center of the hurricane was passing to the west of the Cayman Islands, where Premier Wayne Panton said the government and its opposition were working together to keep the people as safe as possible. No major damage was reported there Monday, and residents were going back into the streets as the winds died down.\n\nIan won‚Äôt linger over Cuba, but will slow down over the Gulf of Mexico, growing wider and stronger, ‚Äúwhich will have the potential to produce significant wind and storm surge impacts along the west coast of Florida,‚Äù the hurricane center said.\n\nA surge of up to 10 feet (3 meters) of ocean water and 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain was predicted across the Tampa Bay area, with as much as 15 inches (38 centimeters) inches in isolated areas. That‚Äôs enough water to inundate coastal communities.\n\nMichael Brennan, the acting deputy director of NOAA, discusses the forecast track of Hurricane Ian. (Source: CNN)\n\nAs many as 300,000 people may be evacuated from low-lying areas in Hillsborough County alone, county administrator Bonnie Wise said. Some of those evacuations were beginning Monday afternoon in the most vulnerable areas, with schools and other locations opening as shelters.\n\n‚ÄúWe must do everything we can to protect our residents. Time is of the essence,‚Äù Wise said.\n\nFloridians lined up for hours in Tampa to collect bags of sand and cleared store shelves of bottled water. Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a statewide emergency and warned that Ian could lash large areas of the state, knocking out power and interrupting fuel supplies as it swirls northward off the state‚Äôs Gulf coast.\n\n‚ÄúYou have a significant storm that may end up being a Category 4 hurricane,‚Äù DeSantis said at a news conference. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs going to cause a huge amount of storm surge. You‚Äôre going to have flood events. You‚Äôre going to have a lot of different impacts.‚Äù\n\nDeSantis said the state has suspended tolls around the Tampa Bay area and mobilized 5,000 Florida state national guard troops, with another 2,000 on standby in neighboring states.\n\nPresident Joe Biden also declared an emergency, authorizing the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate disaster relief and provide assistance to protect lives and property. The president postponed a scheduled Tuesday trip to Florida because of the storm.\n\nPlaying it safe, NASA planned to begin slowly rolling its moon rocket from the launch pad to its Kennedy Space Center hangar, adding weeks of delay to the test flight.\n\nFlash flooding was predicted for much of the Florida peninsula, and heavy rainfall was possible for the southeast United States later this week. With tropical storm force winds extending 115 miles (185 kilometers) from Ian‚Äôs center, watches covered the Florida Keys to Lake Okeechobee.\n\nBob Gualtieri, sheriff of Pinellas County, Florida, which includes St. Petersburg, said in a briefing that although no one will be forced to leave, mandatory evacuation orders are expected to begin Tuesday.\n\n‚ÄúWhat it means is, we‚Äôre not going to come help you. If you don‚Äôt do it, you‚Äôre on your own,‚Äù Gualtieri said.\n\nZones to be evacuated include all along Tampa Bay and the rivers that feed it. St. Petersburg Mayor Ken Welch urged residents not to ignore any evacuation orders.\n\n‚ÄúThis is a very real threat that this storm poses to our community,‚Äù Welch said.\n\nThe hurricane center has advised Floridians to have survival plans in place and monitor updates of the storm‚Äôs evolving path.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press contributors include Curt Anderson in St. Petersburg, Florida; Anthony Izaguirre in Tallahassee, Florida; and Julie Walker in New York.\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

    "Life Expectancy: The US and Cuba in the Time of Covid": "The article documents that, for the first time, life expectancy in Cuba exceeds that in the US by almost three years. It explores intertwined reasons behind this occurrence, including responses to Covid, health care systems, racism, poverty, misinformation campaigns, the embargo, international solidarity efforts, and resilience to climate change.\n\nRecent data shows that between 2019 and 2021, life expectancy (LE) in the US plunged almost three years while for Cuba it edged up 0.2 years. Yet, in 1960, the year after its revolution, Cuba had a LE of 64.2 years, lower by 5.6 years than that in the US (69.8 years). As I document in Cuban Health Care , the island quickly caught up to the US and, from 1970 through 2016, the two countries were nip and tuck, with some years Cuba and other years the US, having a longer LE. But neither country was ever as much as one year of LE ahead of the other.\n\nLife Expectancy (LE) in US and Cuba, 2017-2021\n\nYear LE US LE Cuba US ‚Äì Cuba 2021 76.1* 79.0 ‚Ä° ‚Äì 2.9 2020 78.8‚Ä† 78.9 ‚Ä° -0.1 2019 79.0* 78.8 ‚Ä° +0.2 2018 78.7‚Ä† 78.7 ‚Ä° 0.0 2017 78.6‚Ä† 78.6 ‚Ä° 0.0\n\nThis continued through the beginning of Covid, which sharply changed the pattern. LE in the US suddenly dropped behind that in Cuba. Bernd Debusmann Jr.of BBC News wrote , LE in the US fell ‚Äúto the lowest level seen since 1996. Government data showed LE at birth now stands at 76.1 compared to 79 in 2019. That is the steepest two-year decline in a century.‚Äù From 2019 to 2020 , ‚ÄúLE declined in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nHow could a country with all the problems of Cuba, actually have LE almost three years greater than the US? There were enormous differences between the way the countries responded to Covid.\n\nThe Covid Contrast\n\nUS Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data confirmed that ‚Äú Covid-19 was the main contributing factor [to changes in LE]. The statistics show that Covid-19 accounted for 50% of the decline between 2020 and 2021. Between 2019 and 2020, the pandemic contributed to 74% of the decline.‚Äù\n\nA critical divergence between the two countries is that Cuba guarantees health care to all as a human right while the US system is based on profit and political grandstanding. When Covid hit, the US dawdled for months as Cuba mobilized for medical action.\n\nThe Ministry of Health developed a national strategy before the island‚Äôs first victim had succumbed to the disease. Cuban TV carried daily press conferences with detailed info on the status of new patients, results of cabinet meetings on Covid, and announcing the best way for citizens to protect themselves and others. Social distancing, masks and contact tracing were universally accepted.\n\nEach day Cuban medical students knocked on doors to ask citizens how they were. Students‚Äô tasks included obtaining survey data from residents and making extra visits to the elderly, infants and those with respiratory problems. Clinic staff dealt with issues that doctors were unable to cope with and sent patients they could not care for to hospitals. Medical data was used by those in the highest decision-making positions of the country. In this way, every Cuban citizen and every health care worker, from those at neighborhood doctor offices through those at the most esteemed research institutes, had a part in determining health policy.\n\nThis inclusive approach resulted in Cuba‚Äôs having 87 Covid deaths by July 21, 2020, when the US had experienced 140,300. While the US population is 30 times that of Cuba, it had 1613 times as many deaths.\n\nTwo aspects of Cuba‚Äôs response to Covid stand out. First, Cuba does NOT have more money to spend on health care. It actually spends less than a tenth as much per person per year than does the US, but it spends that wisely on a holistic system. Second, Cuba‚Äôs health care is global ‚Äì it continued its practice of sending thousands of medical staff to other countries during Covid.\n\nOver the past six decades more than 400,000 Cuban medical professionals have worked in 164 countries and improved the lives of hundreds of millions of people. In addition to providing Cuban doctors with experience coping with diseases and medical issues they do not see at home, this action is positive global diplomacy. US diplomacy, on the other hand, seems to focus on threatening to harm people and/or actually harming them.\n\nIn Addition to Covid\n\nNews stories also mentioned other factors associated with the shorter LE in the US: drug overdoses, heart disease, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis and suicides. The corporate press also acknowledged racial disparities.\n\nThere had been progress in reducing LE differences between Black and white Americans. This was reversed during 2018 ‚Äì 2020 when LE went down 1.36 years for whites, 3.25 years for Hispanics, and 3.88 years for Blacks.\n\nThe fall in US life expectancy was even more pronounced among Native Americans and Alaska Natives. Since 2019, it ‚Äúdropped by 6.6 years, more than twice that of the wider US population.‚Äù\n\nThe US has multiple groups who reject government attempts to vaccinate or wear masks. Most loud-mouthed, of course, are the right wingers who lividly despise the very idea of public health campaigns. While their thought processes are hallucination-based, people of color have reality-based fears of being ignored, lied to, and used for government experimentation, such as the Tuskegee Syphilis Study. There is a strong connection between vaccination hesitation and racism.\n\nWhat They Did Not Look At\n\nAmong factors with increasing US Covid rates ignored by corporate media in the US are poverty, an acute rise in misinformation, abortion, the embargo against Cuba and preparation for climate change.\n\nPoverty . The first task of the Cuban revolution was to simultaneously address poverty, food, sanitation, literacy, education, racism and housing, which the rebels saw as parts of unitary whole. During the Covid crisis, many US corporations were determined to force low wage workers to stay at their jobs, spreading the disease. Cuba told those with Covid to stay home.\n\nMisinformation . Discussions of Covid deaths must not ignore the deadly role of science denial. At the same time Trump was foolishly downplaying mounting dangers of Covid, Cuba was far along developing its ‚ÄúNovel Coronavirus Plan for Prevention and Control.‚Äù Trump was not and is not an isolated individual ‚Äì he manifests a life-threatening movement toward lunacy. Cuba has no significant group which confronts Covid with a bottle of Clorox or expects a cure brought by Q Anon on a flying saucer.\n\nAbortion . Cuba also does not have a ‚ÄúWomen‚Äôs Lives Don‚Äôt Matter!‚Äù movement seeking to eliminate abortion rights. Those who do not want an abortion do not get one and people do not seek to impose their religious and spiritual beliefs on others. The Supreme Court‚Äôs allowing states to criminalize abortion will cause many women to die, due both from self-attempts at abortion and lack of its availability. LE averages are impacted more by deaths of young than elderly; so, we can expect many abortion-induced deaths in US will be among teenagers and young women, which will affect LE.\n\nEmbargo . The ‚Äútrade sanctions‚Äù or ‚Äúblockade‚Äù or ‚Äúembargo‚Äù have a special relationship with LE in Cuba: one might expect it to decrease LE; but it has not done so. When Cuba was reeling from the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, the US passed laws intending to punish those who continued to trade with it. This raised prices in the already impoverished country and has prevented or slowed the arrival of much life-saving medical equipment. Yet, due to its prioritizing health care during the 1990s, Cuba‚Äôs infant mortality decreased while its LE showed a slight increase.\n\nInternational solidarity movements have stepped in to help Cuba overcome many embargo effects. Lack of essential material prevented Cuba from performing liver transplants in children. But, during May 2022, Puentes de Amor (Bridges of Love) delivered the vital chemical compound to the William Soler Pediatric Hospital.\n\nResilience . Avoiding the use of fossil fuels and enormous hydro-, solar- and wind-projects, as Cuba does, will cut down on global destructiveness but have very little effect on reducing climate change on the island. However, preparing for resilience in the face of climate change can hugely affect its quality of life.\n\nIn March 2022 (p. 8) Scientific American editors wrote that most important in preparing for the next pandemic is ‚Äúbuilding new systems.‚Äù Unfortunately, this is what the US is avoiding as it becomes absorbed in making minor tweaks to outmoded, inadequate systems of environmental protection.\n\nCuba has been holding Basti√≥n (bulwark) events involving as many as four million citizens who carry out food production, disease control, sanitation and safeguarding medical supplies. When a policy change is introduced, government representatives go to each community, including the most remote rural ones, to make sure that everyone knows the threats that climate change poses to their lives and how they can alter behaviors to minimize them. They include such diverse actions as conservation with energy use, saving water, preventing fires and using medical products sparingly.\n\nAnother energy positive being expanded in Cuba is farms being run entirely on agroecology principles. Such farms can produce 12 times the energy they consume. Biodigesters break down manure and other biomass to create biogas (very different in Cuba than the US) which is used for tractors or transportation. Vegetable and herb production in Cuba exploded from 4000 tons in 1994 to over four million tons by 2006. This is why Jason Hickel‚Äôs ‚ÄúSustainable Development Index‚Äù rated Cuba‚Äôs ecological efficiency as the best in the world in 2019.\n\nWhere Are We Headed?\n\nThe connection between LE and climate change is becoming increasingly evident. US media stories typically focus on a given disaster such as a flood and mention how aging infrastructure is being neglected. The implication is that if infrastructure were updated to its status of 50 or 100 years ago, that would be adequate. It would not be adequate because climate change means that storms will be more frequent, more intense and more deadly in the future.\n\nBy 2017, Cuba had become the only country with a government-led plan (Project Life, or Tarea Vida) to combat climate change which includes a 100 year projection. While Cuba is looking ahead and planning how to protect people from increasingly devastating storms, US politicians feverishly bury their heads in the sand in subservience to corporate interests, subjecting future generations to ever greater catastrophes.\n\nThis causes LE in the US to plunge down while LE in Cuba climbs slowly upward. Covid did not create the LE divide between the US and Cuba. Covid exacerbated trends which have become increasingly intertwined for decades. The best guess is that these trends will continue well into the future.",

Next, an email about a crypto project he‚Äôs working on‚ÄîCuban agreed to buy the digital rights to drawings by one of the World Trade Center architects and is planning to turn them into NFTs. He squints. The type‚Äôs too small. Next. Finally, an email from an aspiring entrepreneur. His first act of mercy: ‚ÄúI like these guys. I‚Äôll save them for later.‚Äù\n\nCuban in real life is not that much different from the role he‚Äôs played for 11 years‚Äîor in TV math, 13 seasons‚Äîon Shark Tank. He listens to everyone, at least briefly, before making snap judgments. His personal email address is public (mcuban@gmail.com), and the billionaire investor slogs through every scam, spam message or pitch sent his way. Why? He can‚Äôt help it. ‚ÄúTo me it‚Äôs the sport I get to compete in and I get to be really good at,‚Äù he says, grinning. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be 110 years old still doing whatever is the equivalent 50 years from now of responding to email.‚Äù\n\nCuban, the entrepreneur, has founded more than ten companies, starting in 1983 with software reseller MicroSolutions and up to Cost Plus Drugs, the public benefit corporation he star¬≠ted in January 2022, which aims to lower prescription drug prices. Cuban, the insta-billionaire, sold Broadcast.com, an internet sports radio outfit, to Yahoo for $5.7 billion at the peak of the dot-com bubble in 1999 (a few years la¬≠ter, Yahoo shuttered the service). Cuban, the investor, has poured at least $25 million into crypto concerns (including dogecoin, the currency famously started as a joke) and taken stakes in at least 400 startups, many through Shark Tank.\n\nSome of his gambles have done all right; some have blown up. But more than two decades later, Broadcast.com is still the main reason he got so rich, worth an estima¬≠ted $4.6 billion. (Cuban didn‚Äôt start Broadcast.com; it was founded in 1992 by Chris Jaeb. He joined three years later with his college buddy Todd Wagner, also a Broadcast.com billionaire.) The Yahoo sale earned Cuban an estimated $1.1 billion payout after taxes. He spent $280 million of that buying a majority stake in the NBA‚Äôs Dallas Mavericks the next year. Bam, another slam dunk. Now worth $2.2 billion, according to Forbes‚Äô estimate, his 85% stake in the team represents almost half his fortune.\n\nPhoto by Guerin Blask for Forbes\n\n‚ÄúOn the one hand I understand that nobody should have this much wealth, but it is what it is,‚Äù Cuban says. ‚ÄúYou make the best of it, and I don‚Äôt feel guilty about it at all. I busted my ass to get here.‚Äù\n\nCuban is the rare billionaire who seems to actually enjoy being rich. In his younger years he embraced his wealth by buying a sprawling Dallas mansion, an apartment on Central Park West and a private jet, and traveling the world partying ‚Äúlike a rock star.‚Äù More recently he‚Äôs been having a blast doling out advice on Shark Tank and via Twitter (he has 8.8 million followers), buying shots for strangers and running his mouth to anyone who will listen. He still spends money on fun stuff. Case in point: He recently bought the town of Mustang, Texas (population: zero), as a favor to a dying friend (‚Äúthis was his big asset‚Äù), and appointed one of his other pals the mayor. The billionaire toyed with the idea of filling the ghost town with life-size robotic dinosaurs made by one of his Shark Tank entrepreneurs but has since deemed that impractical. He‚Äôs open to other ideas. (Email him.)\n\nOn the far side of the seriousness spectrum from animatronic T-Rexes is his new pharmaceutical business, Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drugs, which he‚Äôs positioning as the remedy to skyrocketing prescription prices. Launched nine months ago, Cost Plus Drugs offers steep discounts on around 350 different generic medications. Generic Crestor, a cholesterol-lowering med, costs $151 a month at the local CVS, a steep discount from the brand-name pill, which runs $329. Cuban sells it for $4.80. Ditto Glucophage, a diabetes drug. The generic sells for $20 at CVS, versus $3.90 at Cost Plus. Or there‚Äôs the generic version of antidepressant Zoloft, which is $50 at CVS but $4.20 at Cost Plus.\n\n‚ÄúNobody should have this much wealth, but it is what it is. You make the best of it, and I don‚Äôt feel guilty about it at all.‚Äù\n\nCuban can offer such low prices because he bypasses the pharma industry‚Äôs many middlemen, including the price negotiators known as pharmacy benefit managers. (It is a huge, notoriously opaque business. Market leader CVS Caremark generated $153 billion in sales in 2021.) Instead, Cuban buys directly from the folks who manufacture the pills, paying them just enough to make it worth their while, then sells them online at a fixed markup of 15%, plus $8 for shipping and fees. It‚Äôs not an entirely novel idea. Walmart and Costco are experimenting with similar models. But Cuban, perhaps thanks to his celeb¬≠rity, is quickly gaining traction. Cost Plus Drugs already claims more than a million customers and says it is growing at a rate of about 10% each week, on track to be profitable in 2023. Cuban is uncharacteristically tight-lipped about revenue; Forbes estimates Cost Plus has booked at least $25 million in sales during its first nine months as an operating concern.\n\nCuban, who notes that it‚Äôs the first com¬≠pany he‚Äôs ever put his name on, has invested close to $100 million so far and says he‚Äôs all in on the idea and willing to spend ‚Äúwhatever it takes.‚Äù It is, in his own words, ‚Äúlegacy defining. If we get this right, this will be the most impactful thing I‚Äôve ever done.‚Äù\n\nHe insists he will pull back from other projects to focus on Cost Plus Drugs. He is even considering stepping away from Shark Tank. ‚ÄúPart of me wants to quit,‚Äù he says. He‚Äôs not worried about whether the show will sink or swim. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll survive fine without me.‚Äù\n\nKILLER INSTINCTS | (From left) Longtime Shark Tank stars Mark Cuban, Barbara Corcoran, Kevin O‚ÄôLeary and Lori Greiner with guest investor Daniel Lubetzky, the founder of Kind bars, during the show‚Äôs 13th season. ABC\n\nC uban‚Äôs friends and family all say the same thing: He was a born entrepreneur. Raised in the quiet Pittsburgh suburb of Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania, as the eldest of three sons of working-class parents, he stood out from a young age for his endless stream of moneymaking schemes.\n\n‚ÄúHe was always doing stuff, always hustling to make a buck,‚Äù says younger brother Jeff, who runs Cuban‚Äôs entertainment properties, including movie distributor Magnolia Pictures. Once, during a printer strike in Pennsylvania, a teenaged Cuban got up before dawn and drove 130 miles to Cleveland to buy newspapers to sell in his hometown.\n\n‚ÄúLuck is a huge part of everyone‚Äôs success. Shaq used to give me a hard time: ‚ÄòOh, you got lucky.‚Äô And I‚Äôm like, ‚Äòyou planned to be seven-foot-two and athletic, right?‚Äô‚Äù\n\nThe ploys got more ambitious as he got older. As a rising senior at the University of Indiana, he begged and borrowed enough‚Äîeven dipping into his student loans‚Äîto purchase a local bar, Motley‚Äôs Pub. It was at Motley‚Äôs, which was eventually forced to close because of underage drinking, that he met his future Broadcast.com partner Todd Wagner. In August, Cuban returned to the site of Motley‚Äôs, now called Kilroy‚Äôs on Kirkwood, and left a $10,000 tip after buying 100 shots for its patrons.\n\n‚Äú[He] always knew he was either going to make it big or he was just going to go broke,‚Äù says Jerry Katz, who has known Cuban since kindergarten.\n\nBy 32, Cuban was a multimillionaire after selling Micro¬≠Solutions to CompuServe, an early online service, for $6 million. He decided to retire. But that didn‚Äôt stick for long. In 1995, the year Netscape went public, he and Wagner bought into Broadcast.com, then called AudioNet, which was struggling to find a way to provide the play-by-play of out-of-town sports, even experimenting with shortwave radio. Cuban and Wagner took the idea online. As Web 1.0 mania inflated, Broadcast.com recorded the best-ever IPO at the time, ending its first trading day with a market cap of $1 billion, more than 300 times its sales of $3.2 million. It sold to Yahoo a year later.\n\nCuban knew a bubble when he saw one. He and Wagner were paid in Yahoo shares, but in a savvy move suggested by Cuban, the duo used stock collars to cap their upside if the stock jumped‚Äîbut limited their downside if the shares plummeted. Still, he readily admits that his lucky break was exactly that. ‚ÄúLuck is a huge part of everyone‚Äôs success. Shaq used to give me a hard time when I first got to the NBA. He goes, ‚ÄòOh, you got lucky.‚Äô And I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄòYou planned to be seven-foot-two and athletic, right?‚Äô‚Äù\n\nWagner, who has partnered with Cuban on multiple businesses since, including the Mavericks, and who himself is worth some $1.8 billion, argues it‚Äôs much more than just luck. ‚ÄúMark, I think, has always had an ability, and still does, to see around corners,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI think of Mark as the smartest, best-prepared guy in the room.‚Äù\n\nA s much as he loves money, Cuban might love being famous even more. In 2004, he starred in The Benefactor, ABC‚Äôs answer to Donald Trump‚Äôs Apprentice, in which 16 contestants competed for $1 million out of Cuban‚Äôs fortune. It was canceled after one season. (Trump later wrote to Cuban consoling him on his ‚Äúdisastrous‚Äù and ‚Äúembarrassing‚Äù effort. ‚ÄúIf you ever decide to do another show, please call me and I will be happy to lend a helping hand.‚Äù) A big silver lining: meeting producer Clay Newbill, who later recruited him for Shark Tank. Cuban wasn‚Äôt available for the show‚Äôs pilot in 2009 but joined as a ‚Äúguest shark‚Äù in the second season in 2011. He has been on every episode since.\n\n‚ÄúEverybody, at some level, wants to be a celebrity,‚Äù says Cuban, who has also appeared in dozens of TV shows and movies as himself, including Entourage and Brooklyn Nine-Nine.\n\nLike other Hollywood types, Cuban has become enamored with NFTs, down to owning a CryptoPunk (No. 869, currently valued at $95,000.) He was a prominent supporter of NBA Top Shot, the league‚Äôs highly successful NFT marketplace (more than $1 billion in total sales since its October 2020 launch), and even star¬≠ted his own NFT platform, Lazy.com, where he displays his personal collection. In March 2021, the Mavericks became the first NBA team to accept the meme cryptocurrency dogecoin as a form of payment‚Äîand (incredibly) still do despite the currency plummeting 90% since last year. It‚Äôs quite an about-face for Cuban, who quipped back in 2019 that he‚Äôd ‚Äúrather have bananas‚Äù than bitcoin.\n\nLast October, the Mavericks inked a five-year partnership with Voyager Digital, one of the fastest-growing publicly traded crypto brokerages in the United States. Voya¬≠ger has since lost 99% of its value and filed for bankruptcy, prompting a group of customers to sue Cuban, arguing that his endorsement duped everyday investors into pumping $5 billion (now frozen) into the platform. Cuban won‚Äôt comment on the lawsuit beyond saying it won‚Äôt stop him from promoting crypto.\n\nThe launch of Cost Plus Drugs in January was years in the making for Cuban‚Äîand even longer for his cofounder, Alex Oshmyansky, a radiologist from Colorado who, with some doctor friends, came up with the idea of selling off-patent drugs at manufacturing cost back in 2015. The doctors imagined it as a nonprofit and spent three years searching for funding. ‚ÄúWe failed spectacularly and didn‚Äôt raise a single dime beyond what I put in myself,‚Äù says Oshmyansky, who invested about $200,000. In 2018, he switched gears and reincorporated as a public benefit corporation, meaning he could run the pharmacy as a business rather than a charity. That‚Äôs when Cuban got involved.\n\nThe billionaire‚Äôs initial investment was small (about $250,000), but he incrementally put in more money as the company made progress in overcoming regulatory hurdles and persuading hesitant drug manufacturers to participate. It took a full year to convince the first manufacturer, New Jersey‚Äìbased Amneal Pharmaceuticals, to agree to make drugs for Cost Plus. At first, Cost Plus offered just 100 medi¬≠cations from three manufacturers. Now it works with 20 manufacturing partners and is adding about 100 new drugs every month.\n\nCost Plus is also planning to manufacture its own medi¬≠cations. Its $11 million, 22,000-square-foot Dallas manu¬≠facturing facility is set to open in November. The all-robotic plant has been designed as a ‚Äúflexible‚Äù facility that can quickly pivot to make whatever drugs the company can‚Äôt source from other manufacturers.\n\nA Shark‚Äôs Mark\n\nIn his 13 seasons as a Shark Tank judge, Mark Cuban says he‚Äôs invested $29 million in at least 85 companies. He has hit a handful of home runs, but just like a traditional VC, he‚Äôs also struck out a bunch (at least two Cuban-backed startups have declared bankruptcy or stopped operating). One big winner: preschool app Brightwheel, of which Cuban owns a 2% stake worth $12 million, 20 times his estimated investment. Here are a couple more from each side of the scorecard.\n\nWinners\n\n\n\n\n\ntk tk\n\nDude Products\n\nFour young guys in Chicago who prefer baby wipes to toilet paper invented flushable Dude Wipes, packaged in single travel packets for on-the-go use.

In September, the company raised $15 million from private investors at a $200 million valuation.\n\nLosers\n\n\n\n\n\nBreathometer\n\nCuban put an estimated $250,000 into this smartphone attachment to measure blood alcohol levels in 2013 but later called it his worst investment.

It floundered, filing for bankruptcy in 2012‚Äîjust one year after Cuban and fellow shark Kevin O‚ÄôLeary pledged to invest $200,000 on the show.\n\n\n\n\n\n‚ÄîConor Murray and Jemima McEvoy\n\nFor all its benefits, Cost Plus has some major limitations. The company doesn‚Äôt accept insurance. Nor does it currently sell drugs that are still protected by patents, which include blockbusters like Humira (arthritis) and Trulicity (diabetes). ‚ÄúOur goal is to be the low-cost provider of medications, and we will surprise a lot of people when we have branded drugs,‚Äù Cuban says. ‚ÄúI think people are just missing us. . . . They kind of pigeonhole us.‚Äù\n\nBeyond pharma, Cuban is thinking about higher ed, another industry ripe for disruption. ‚ÄúThe one thing I will never do is give a school money, because all they‚Äôre going to do is build buildings,‚Äù he says. He argues that a better approach would be universities stripped down to the basics. Skip the ‚Äúpretty dorms,‚Äù fancy cafeterias, rock-climbing walls and Division I sports and focus instead on recruiting the best teachers and keeping tuition low.\n\nBy nature, Cuban is not a pessimist, but the ‚Äúone thing‚Äù that gets him down is American poli¬≠tics. He isn‚Äôt a fan of efforts to hike billionaires‚Äô taxes (shocker!) and thinks the electoral process needs an overhaul. ‚ÄúI want to blow up the two-party system,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúTo me, that is the root of all evil.‚Äù He seriously explored a presidential run in 2020 but decided against it after attracting less than 25% of the vote in a national poll he commissioned.\n\nFour years ago, Cuban turned 60. His birthday celebration was exactly the sort of blowout you might imagine. A host of friends and celebrities‚Äîhis Shark Tank colleagues, singer Jennifer Lopez and her then-fianc√©, former New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez‚Äîgathered on the lawn of his epic 24,000-square-foot Dallas spread. Stevie Wonder and the Chainsmokers, a popular electronic-music duo, provided the entertainment.\n\nToward the end of the night, Cuban wandered up to his childhood friends Jerry Katz and Todd Reidbord. ‚ÄúHe was the drunkest I‚Äôd ever seen anybody, but [he was] a happy person,‚Äù Reidbord recalls. ‚ÄúHe put his arms around us and said, ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt believe this happened to me.‚Äô‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE FROM FORBES\n\nMORE FROM FORBES Crypto Darling Helium Promised A 'People's Network.'

The U.S. government will also stop requiring Cubans seeking visas in family preference categories to travel to Georgetown, Guyana, for their interviews.\n\nAdditional government personnel will staff the embassy to handle the visa requests.

Their story since then has followed the typical communist collapse of terrible living conditions, blackouts, food shortages, crime, civil unrest, and pitiful healthcare.\n\nBut don‚Äôt worry, the World Wildlife Fund‚Äôs Living Planet Report 2006 listed Cuba as the ‚Äòmost sustainable model of development on the planet‚Äô. It is, apparently, ‚Äòenvironmentally sustainable‚Äô with a ‚Äòhigh quality of life‚Äô.\n\nWhy all the praise?

The loss of these four tanks has spread fears of sustained and regular power outages in the months to come.\n\nThe French announced that they would help build the now notorious supertanker hub in 1989 in an agreement between the Bouygues Offshore Group, a Soviet company, and the Cuban oil ministry. While the original base was largely constructed with money from the Soviets, the destroyed tankers were new and built with help from Venezuela. It is no surprise to hear that after the destruction, President of Venezuela Nicol√°s Maduro has put his hand up to say that he will instruct the Ministry of Petroleum to invest in the rebuilding of the Cuban supertanker hub.\n\nUnsurprisingly, instead of worrying about the massive oil fire, Cuba is more concerned about the environmental impact of ‚Ä¶ Covid.\n\n‚ÄòIt is not difficult to predict then that the disease will cause new and greater damage to biodiversity, aggravating the already existing deterioration of ecosystems,‚Äô said Cuba‚Äôs Minister for Science, Technology and the Environment, Elba Rosa P√©rez Montoya.\n\nIt was part of a ploy to get wealthy countries to re-invest in developing countries to save their biodiversity.\n\nSo, while the communist tyrannies of the world burn fossil fuels and complain about their new Climate Change money-making demon of Covid, the rest of us face a future of Veganism and blackouts.",
    "Cuba grew up with Family Code, D√≠az-Canel states": "President Miguel D√≠az-Canel said on Sunday that Cuba grew up in the process generated by the new Family Code, and expressed confidence in its approval in today's referendum.\n\nIn statements to reporters after exercising his right to vote, the president pointed out that although there should not be a unanimous vote, he does expect majority support from citizens. He acknowledged that a part of Cuban society still fails to understand some elements contained in the regulations because, in 62 years of the Revolution, patriarchal criteria have persisted in some people and families.\n\nThe head of State added that the process of constructing the Code respected everyone‚Äôs right to an opinion, but he regretted that for reasons of belief a part of the citizenry still does not understand that the law respects the type of family that they defend and also protects the rights of other forms of love.\n\nD√≠az-Canel noted that a strategy of demonization of the Cuban Revolution, of discredit, is also underway, which generates a lot of hatred towards everything related to it, mainly on social networks.\n\nIn this regard, he added that those who are part of this platform use very aggressive language against the Code, but none of it has to do with convictions or opinions, because if it said the opposite, they would still criticize it because it is a legal norm within the Revolution.\n\nD√≠az-Canel highlighted the benefits of the legal document, which gives rights and guarantees to the entire society regardless of the type of family organization.\n\nHe stressed that the Family Code was a necessity since the nation has become more heterogeneous and there were debts from the legal point of view, evident in the life stories told these days, recorded in research works, and in situations discussed in court.\n\nThe new law resolves these issues, said the president, who extolled the participation of the people and experts in the process of building the law, and urged them to read it and interpret it with their hearts, putting themselves in the place of others, of those who have experienced complex situations.\n\nI think that Cuba has grown up, the president emphasized, adding that this is the most important thing, the growth as a society.\n\nPhoto: Estudios Revoluci√≥n\n\nPhoto: Estudios Revoluci√≥n\n\nPhoto: Estudios Revoluci√≥n",

    "Three Crises Merge in Cuba‚Äôs Economy: Causes & Risks": "From Progreso Weekly\n\nBy Julio Carranza (Progreso Weekly)\n\nHAVANA TIMES ‚Äì What follows is a text trying to summarize, in a concrete way, the main factors that affect, characterize and challenge the Cuban economy at this time.\n\nFirstly, we must take into account that the economy has been in crisis mode for a long period of time with some intermittent but insufficient recoveries, which began in the 1990s ‚Äî since the fall of the socialist camp and the disappearance of the USSR, plus the intensification of the U.S. blockade. It all gave rise to the obsolescence of the economic model that, without going into details and nuances now, was essentially inspired by the economies of the socialist countries of Eastern Europe that had been established during the first decades of institutionalization of the revolution, especially in the 70s and 80s. This stage, by the way, corresponded to the period of greatest growth and stability of the economy.\n\nPreviously we have tried to make a periodization of this long stage of crisis that has already lasted for more than three decades until reaching this last critical segment that begins in 2020, when the main economic indicators have once again fallen notably and the standard of living of the population has contracted perhaps as in no other previous period, including the special period of the 1990s. In this case with a different generation and under the leadership of a government that, for logical reasons, does not and could not have the influence, the historical authority and the leadership of the then-government.\n\nFactors affecting the current situation:\n\nThe intensification of the U.S. blockade that, after the important but very brief moment of notable improvement in relations with the U.S. during the end of the Barack Obama administration, has reached strong extremes under the delusional administration of Donald Trump and that, so far, has been essentially unchanged during the first two years of Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe impact of the global COVID 19 pandemic, which for more than two years has meant the almost total loss of income derived from tourism, and the commitment of important and very scarce resources to face its various internal consequences.\n\nThe extraordinary achievement during this period, perhaps the only significant one in this context, was by the Cuban scientific community that quickly and effectively obtained more than one vaccine to guarantee total coverage of the population is remarkable.\n\nThe weight of the external debt, time and time again partially renegotiated with Cuba‚Äôs main creditors (including China and Russia, with whom it was possible to suspend the payment of their service until 2027), but which continues to limit the country‚Äôs access to credit, trade, and international investment.\n\nThe deterioration of the international situation, impacted by the war in Ukraine, which, in economic terms, is characterized by volatility and uncertainty in the markets, as well as by a strong inflationary process worldwide.\n\nFinally, an essential factor of an internal nature is the late, slow and not sufficiently integrated economic reform that the national economy should have.\n\nIf the combination of the above factors is taken into account, it could be stated that the challenges and pressures have been enormous and the response has not been up to the task and with the certainty and agility required. Although the resistance capacity that the country has shown in the face of difficulties and aggression must be recognized, despite moments of increased social tension.\n\nThree crises at once\n\nTrying to dissect the current situation, it could be said that the national economy faces at least three crises that overlap and reinforce each other in the same time and space:\n\n1. The structural crisis of the economic model:\n\nAs we stated earlier, beyond the discussion of whether or not it was the best option, the reality is that for years the Cuban economy established a model for organizing the economy inspired by the socialist economies of Eastern Europe and accompanied by a process of integration in the economic space that they formed with the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CAME).\n\nThe disappearance of that world and the closure of the economic space that had allowed Cuba to largely overcome the isolation imposed by the U.S. blockade, made evident from very early on in the 90s the need for a fundamental economic reform of the economy, not to abandon its socialist horizon, but to adapt it to the new and difficult international conditions. Contributing and discussing that necessary change is what motivated our book published in Havana in 1995, ‚ÄúCuba: Restructuring the Economy: A Contribution to the Debate‚Äù (Carranza, Guti√©rrez and Monreal). However, beyond specific changes, some of them certainly very important, up to now the model of organization of the national economy has not been restructured to the extent needed and with the necessary depth.\n\nAfter almost two decades of debates and above all the accumulation of evidence, the party congresses discussed and approved documents that opened the political space to advance in the necessary economic reform, mainly ‚ÄúThe conceptualization of the economic model,‚Äù the ‚ÄúGuidelines‚Äù and finally the new Constitution of the Republic approved by the majority vote of the population. However, the measures for change were adopted slowly (if not late) and without sufficient comprehensiveness, which has delayed and continues to delay the articulation of the only strategic solution that, in our opinion, the Cuban socialist economy has in overcoming the immense challenges it faces and the enormous pressures that oppose it.\n\nEssential to the process is the integrating the different economic actors based on their various forms of ownership and management, a deep reform of the state company (leader of the system), reform of the agricultural production subsystem, modification of the relationship between planning and the market, move the economic model towards greater decentralization, construction of markets ‚Äî including the means of production and monetary markets ‚Äî with their corresponding regulations, an active monetary, exchange and fiscal policy economically based and rigorously implemented, a focused and effective social policy, an investment policy that respond to national priorities, etc. and everything in the right sequence.\n\nThe reform of the state company is a key point. Make changes, both in their internal organization (so that they better express the interests of their owner, which is the people), as well as the ways in which they relate to each other and to the rest of the economic actors, to create the conditions that allow them to raise their efficiency, which today, in general terms, is at clearly low levels.\n\nA more dynamic economy is needed with greater autonomy and in a competitive context and strong financial restrictions. The leadership of the state company in the national economy should not and cannot be established by ‚Äúdecree,‚Äù but rather the result of its scale, efficiency and profitability.\n\nThe proper operation of the markets, with the necessary regulations, including the money market, is impossible without a reformed state company that allows it to attend to them without causing strong distortions. The markets must integrate all the economic actors (state, cooperative and private, plus foreign investment companies), under the leadership of the state company, which must also respond to a more strategic and financial planning than traditional bureaucratic planning that has affected the socialist economies, the Cuban one included.\n\nThe macroeconomic crisis\n\nSecond, the precipitated macroeconomic crisis after 2020, with the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic ‚Äî in a two year period the economy contracted more than 13%, with a very slight recovery of 1.3% during the last year ‚Äî imports were drastically and abruptly reduced, with which the scarcity of practically everything invaded the spaces of the national economy, generating multiple difficulties and growing discomfort in the population.\n\nAll marketing spaces have been characterized over the last two and a half years by a sustained shortage and permanent queues, more in those that offer products in national currency, but also in those that offer in MLC, the latter more difficult to understand since it is a segment that can finance itself and sustain the flow of foreign exchange that favors the economy. (In this sense, and as several economists have been proposing for some time, a greater liberalization of the wholesale and retail markets has recently been decided, a measure still to be implemented.)\n\nThe most evident expression of this dimension of the crisis is the galloping inflation and the monetary chaos that remains and grows in the country as a result of the contraction of the economy and also of the insufficiencies and inaccuracies with which the economic policy has been conducted during the last two and a half years, including how the so-called ‚Äúmonetary order‚Äù ‚Äî started in January 2021 ‚Äî was conceived and implemented.\n\nWe have expanded on the reasons for the impact of this on the growth of inflation in previous articles. The causes of inflation are not only in the economic and monetary policy, without a doubt there are also external factors, but the internal economic policy has fueled it notably.\n\nOn the one hand, the multiplication of business costs with the devaluation of the national currency from January 2021, and then, trying to compensate for the rise in prices with an excessive expansion of demand with the increase in various incomes and the distribution of ‚Äúutilities‚Äù without the productive support and precise calculations that allow maintaining macroeconomic balances and keeping the fiscal deficit under control, essential factors for the stability and growth of any economy.\n\nThe strong expansion of demand in an economy such as Cuba‚Äôs, where the country‚Äôs industrial and productive base in general, including agriculture, is so affected, while still tied by clearly unjustified limitations (in addition to pressure from the blockade), makes the response to that monetary expansion not productive but inflationary, it does not exist, so that it can be quickly activated, what Keynesians called ‚Äúmultiplication factor‚Äù.\n\nHence the importance of the underestimated sequentiality and comprehensiveness of the reform. Before multiplying costs and expanding demand, conditions must be created for the recovery of supply via production with adequate progress in the comprehensive economic reform, including the consolidation of the different economic actors, including the emerging private sector of SMEs and cooperatives, as well as and essentially, we insist, the reform of the state company, also with a part of the available foreign exchange dedicated to maintain essential imports, especially medicines, food and certain means of production, even when this implies a reduction in the rate of investment in sectors such as tourism.\n\nIn other words, of course, the establishment of an integrated exchange market and monetary order must be a very important component of the reform, but not in any way, with any order, or at any time.\n\nAdded to the regulations are the recent measures for the establishment of a market for the purchase and sale of currencies, but it is being carried out again in a partial, limited and disintegrated manner, which has motivated a new spiral of growth in the price of foreign currency in the parallel market, with all its implications, among them the rise of inflation, which mainly affects the lower-income sectors, which in Cuba affects the largest sector of the population.\n\nIt should be noted that certain official prices (including fuel and other services and products offered in the state network) have maintained their level anchored in the exchange of 1 USD for 24 CUP, which was established in January 2021. However, due to the new official parallel rate OF 1 USD for 120 CUP, plus the informal one that is already around 150 CUP, it turns out that for holders of foreign currency or MLC (not the majority of the population that only receives national currency and therefore deals with low incomes), these products and services have, via the exchange rate, a comparatively low price (gasoline is a typical case), which causes significant losses to the state. It is the expression of the great distortion of the money market that this process has created.\n\nMonetary policy is a fundamental instrument of economic policy and also of social policy. It cannot be treated simply as a mechanism for ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù of foreign currency because these negative distortions are generated. Previously we had stated that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãevaluating the possibility of investing a few million dollars to expand and bring the money market under control ‚Äî of course there is not enough foreign currency ‚Äî is not a minor matter. It is a fundamental factor in contributing to put the foreign exchange market and inflation under greater control ‚Äî a fundamental social priority. It might even be possible to obtain international credits for this purpose. It is a subject as complex as it is essential, so a discussion about it with the corresponding specialists, calculating and reviewing the data, would be very convenient.\n\nOn the other hand, continuing to seek and apply various ways to alleviate the pressure of the external debt is also a factor of great importance, including the exchange of debt for investment, bond issuance, etc. Without payment guarantees there is no possibility of obtaining the resources that the country needs through credit and investment. This is a critical point.\n\nThe country‚Äôs economists have talked a lot, and rightly so, about the need for a more balanced investment policy adjusted to national priorities where the agricultural sector stands out for its role in guaranteeing the food security of the population, now notably affected.\n\nAccording to calculations made by economists, between 2 billion and 2.5 billion dollars of investment per year would be necessary to sustain a GDP growth rate of more than 5% per year. The current level is very far from that figure. This supposes greater incentives and policy updates for foreign investment, including aspects such as direct payment to workers hired by investors, etc. But to return to our essential point, an economic model that works in an integrated and efficient manner is also decisive in this matter, including the existence and functionality of structures such as financial services, insurance, post, connectivity. Do they exist? Yes. Do they work effectively? No.\n\nThe sectoral crisis\n\nAdded to the two previous dimensions of the crisis is the specific crisis in important sectors of the economy: mainly energy and agriculture.\n\nThe former is affected not only by prices and difficulties in accessing fuel, but also, and very importantly, by the lack of sufficient foresight in the maintenance cycles of the country‚Äôs main power plants, as well as in fuel tanks, which is the reason for constant breakages and accidents. Are they causes or risks?\n\nOf course, the lack of foreign currency and the blockade limits the proper maintenance and capital repairs, but it is a factor that the economy must have enough time and include in its strategic plans. There is not only an economic problem in this, there is also a national security problem.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning here that the insufficient progress in the installation of alternative energy sources that contribute to changing the national energy matrix. Cuba still has an immense space and conditions to advance in this field.\n\nOn the other hand, the crisis in the agricultural sector, which despite having benefited from a set of liberalizing measures has not yet had the strategic transformation it needs. That is, as we have stated on other occasions, what is needed is a profound change of the agricultural production subsystem as part of the general and comprehensive reform of the economy. ‚ÄúA group of measures‚Äù is not enough, no matter how positive they may be. The incentives, links and forms of management in the entire agricultural sector, from production and distribution to marketing and consumption, must be fully transformed.\n\nThe country cannot allow itself to have strong limitations in the supply of food and at the same time idle land and other lands with productivity levels far below those that could be obtained, even taking into account the strong limitations imposed by the blockade.\n\nMention should also be made here of the deterioration of the traditional sugar sector, whose current production levels are still insufficient even to cover national demand.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is imperative that the economic strategy and the economic policy respond to these three crises at the same time, with the integrality and the necessary sequence, without the solutions to the emergencies dismantling or hindering the strategic solution that is, I insist, in the integral and deep transformation of the organization of the economic model, preserving its character of justice and social inclusion, complex and difficult, yes, impossible, no. The future of the country is at stake. Time runs fast and is a critical variable.\n\n*Julio Carranza, PhD in Economic Sciences, is considered among the most lucid Cuban specialists.\n\nRead more from Cuba here on Havana Times.",

    "US Migration from Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua Soars in August": "The number of Venezuelans, Cubans and Nicaraguans taken into custody at the U.S. border with Mexico soared in August as migrants from Mexico and traditional sending countries were stopped less frequently, authorities said Monday.\n\nU.S. authorities stopped migrants from Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua about 56,000 times last month, up from 49,826 times in July and 23,141 times in August 2021, according to administration officials. At the same time, fewer migrants were stopped from Mexico and the Central American ‚ÄúNorthern Triangle‚Äù countries of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras for a third straight month.\n\nOverall, migrants were stopped about 203,000 times. They were stopped 199,976 times on the U.S. border with Mexico in July and 213,593 times in August 2021.\n\nThe growing numbers from Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua, are the latest sign of rapidly changing migration flows as U.S. authorities wrestle with unusually large influxes.\n\nWhile no single reason can be pinpointed, it is extremely challenging for the U.S. to expel migrants from those countries under a pandemic-era rule known as Title 42, which U.S. officials invoke to deny a chance at seeking asylum on grounds of preventing the spread of COVID-19. U.S. relations with all three countries are deeply strained, making it difficult to impossible to send them home.\n\nMexico agrees to accept migrants expelled under Title 42 if they are from Guatemala, Honduras or El Salvador, in addition to Mexico. While the rule applies to all nationalities in theory, people from those four countries are most affected.\n\nThe Biden administration has leaned on other countries in the Americas to absorb more people fleeing their homes, including Mexico, Costa Rica, which is home to many Nicaraguans, and Colombia, which has taken in millions of Venezuelans in recent years.\n\nVenezuelan migration plummeted early this year after Mexico introduced restrictions on air travel but has increased in recent months as more come over land through the notoriously dangerous Darien Gap in Panama.\n\nIn July, Venezuelans were stopped 17,651 times on the U.S. border with Mexico, most of them in and around Eagle Pass and Del Rio, Texas.\n\nReminders of their presence are in daily headlines. The roughly 50 migrants that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis flew to the upscale Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard were all Venezuelan, as were five of the six bodies that U.S. authorities found drowned to death in the Rio Grande near Eagle Pass on Labor Day weekend.

    "Hurricane Ian will hit Florida as a major storm, forecasters say": "Updated September 26, 2022 at 3:06 PM ET\n\nHurricane Ian is projected to bring a perilous storm surge and winds as strong as 140 mph when it nears Florida's Gulf Coast in the middle of this week, the National Hurricane Center said on Monday.\n\nIan had maximum sustained winds of 85 mph as of 2 p.m. ET Monday ‚Äî but it will rapidly intensify into a major storm, developing wind speeds over 110 mph as it moves toward western Cuba, forecasters say.\n\nAs it hits Cuba, Ian's storm surge \"could raise water levels by as much as 9 to 14 feet above normal tide levels\" in some areas, the hurricane center said. The surge is predicted to be slightly less severe in Florida, but parts of Tampa Bay could still see waters 5 to 10 feet higher than normal.\n\nIan is currently around 120 miles west-northwest of Grand Cayman, moving northwest at 13 mph, the NHC said in its 2 p.m advisory.

In the U.S., roughly 100 miles of the Florida coast is under a hurricane watch, from Englewood north to the Anclote River ‚Äî a stretch that includes Tampa, Clearwater, and St. Petersburg. A hurricane watch is normally issued 48 hours before storm conditions arrive.\n\nIan is the fourth Atlantic hurricane of 2022, a season that only saw its first hurricane earlier this month. So far, predictions of above-average activity in the 2022 hurricane season haven't come to pass ‚Äî a circumstance explained by fluctuations in the jet stream and heat waves in northern latitudes.\n\nBut Ian's menacing approach is a reminder of a warning that hurricane experts often invoke: A single bad storm is enough to upend people's lives.\n\n\"It only takes one land-falling hurricane to make it a bad season for you,\" Jamie Rhome, the NHC's acting director, told NPR earlier this month.\n\nBoth President Biden and Gov.

But experts urge everyone in the region to have an emergency plan in place, even if the latest track doesn't show the storm making landfall in their area.\n\nPredictions currently call for the storm to remain off of Florida's western coast as it moves north toward the Panhandle. But it will drop heavy rain along the way ‚Äî up to 15 inches in local areas, and 8-10 inches in central western Florida overall.\n\nIn areas along the coast, the deepest waters are expected to strike on the storm's right-hand side, due to the double-whammy of the storm surge and waves whipped by strong winds.\n\n\"Regardless of Ian's exact track and intensity, there is a risk of a life-threatening storm surge, hurricane-force winds, and heavy rainfall along the west coast of Florida and the Florida Panhandle by the middle of this week,\" the NHC said on Monday.\n\nGrocery shoppers in the storm's predicted path are stocking up on water, batteries and other supplies.

By other measures, however, things are not quite as rosy. The UN recently demoted the US to 41st, down from 32nd, in a global ranking based on its sustainable development goals. Like everything UN-related, this index is jargony and complicated, but essentially it is focused on the quality of life of ordinary people rather than the creation of wealth. And, on this measure, the US comes just behind Cuba and just above Bulgaria. The US is ‚Äúbecoming a ‚Äòdeveloping country‚Äô,‚Äù one political historian said last week, based on this index.\n\nIf you‚Äôre reading this from the other side of the Atlantic, things aren‚Äôt much better. An analysis in the Financial Times last week found that ‚ÄúOn present trends, the average Slovenian household will be better off than its British counterpart by 2024, and the average Polish family will move ahead before the end of the decade.‚Äù Essentially, the analysis concluded, income inequality in the US and UK is so enormous that the two nations should be classed as poor countries with some very rich people. Most of whom seem to be in the government.",
    "Cuba‚Äôs Family Code Referendum Is Sparking Deep Debates": "On September 25, Cuba will hold just its fourth national referendum since the 1959 Revolution. The vote, which will decide the fate of the government‚Äôs proposed New Family Code, is generating intense debate. Many voters will cast their ballots based not on the content of the Code, but rather their views on the government and the referendum process itself.\n\nAmid a severe economic downturn, much of the public is struggling to access medicine, electricity and even a basic diet. Meanwhile, the administration of President Miguel D√≠az-Canel is scrambling to improve its international image even as it prosecutes a prolonged crackdown on civil society and political opposition. In the wake of the massive anti-government demonstrations of July 11, 2021, over 1,400 alleged participants have been arrested. All of this has precipitated a massive exodus; record numbers of Cubans are attempting to reach the U.S., Spain and other countries.\n\nMany opponents of the government say they will vote against the Family Code to deny the D√≠az-Canel administration a victory that might improve its international image and distract from this backdrop of economic and social crisis. For its part, the government claims noble intentions with the referendum. In the last two referenda on modifications to the constitution, in 2018 and 2019, conservatives prevented marriage equality and other LGBTQ rights from being codified.\n\nNow, the Code would guarantee rights to marriage equality and surrogate pregnancies. It would also codify domestic violence penalties; extend labor rights to those who care full-time for children, the elderly, or people with disabilities; and allow for parental rights to be shared among extended and nontraditional family structures that could include grandparents, stepparents and surrogate mothers.\n\nThose in favor of the Code say it promotes equality by guaranteeing basic rights. Some opponents cite religious objections or discomfort with shifting gender roles or identities, while others are concerned about the Code‚Äôs language around child abuse and education. It would outlaw corporal punishment or ‚Äúany other kind of violence, abuse or inappropriate forms of discipline.‚Äù It also includes a parental duty to educate children to respect authorities and ‚Äúlove of family,‚Äù ‚Äúthe homeland‚Äù and ‚Äúits symbols.‚Äù It would also make it easier for anyone to report physical or verbal abuse of minors to law enforcement.\n\nSome fear the government will abuse these stipulations to separate dissidents from their children. The new Penal Code includes a similar stipulation, forbidding anyone from encouraging a minor ‚Äúnot to fulfill their duties related to respect for and love of the homeland.‚Äù The government has recently used such laws to incarcerate parents for attempting to homeschool their children.\n\nCritics of the referendum also say that in leaving this decision up to a popular vote, the legislature is abdicating its own responsibility to pass laws that guarantee rights, promote equality and protect minorities. This may serve two purposes, they say. First, if the Code is rejected, the government can simply ‚Äúwash its hands‚Äù of gender and sexuality discrimination and ignore the issue. Second, the act of calling a referendum as opposed to simply passing legislation seems performative. After all, Cuban authorities recently approved the new Penal Code and Decree Law 370, which restricts freedom of expression, without referenda. Critics say the government chose to submit the Family Code to a vote only in order to boost the image of Cuba‚Äôs system of ‚Äúdemocratic centralism.‚Äù\n\nThrough this system, the government has sponsored many rounds of discussions about the Code in workplace and local government councils. Officials say they take note of the points made in these discussions and elevate them up decision-making channels. The government has modified its proposal two dozen times, supposedly based on feedback from these discussions. However, there is little transparency in how these decisions are made, and there is no watchdog or auditing body to oversee them. Even so, the government has been praising this system of consultation in the media as its political leadership seeks to show ‚Äúgreater closeness to the people.‚Äù\n\nIf it passes, the Code will also allow the government to posture as aligned with the international left on gender and LGBTQ issues, even as it continues its crackdown on dissent and freedom of expression. For now, the international community continues to condemn the government‚Äôs prosecution and jailing of dissidents, some of them minors, since the July 11 demonstrations.\n\nThe D√≠az-Canel administration seems bent on improving its reputation‚Äîbut without softening its repression of political dissent. This may drive many voters who support much of the content of the Code to vote against it.\n\nTurnout is almost always high in Cuba, because authorities generally view abstention as subversive and can easily identify those who don‚Äôt vote. This is why most people who wish to protest a vote will turn in blank ballots instead of refusing to cast a ballot. Many others vote in line with the government to avoid the problems that come with being identified as a possible dissident.\n\nWhen the votes are tallied in the referendum on the Family Code, observers should keep in mind that the results will reflect much more than simply how people feel about its contents.\n\n‚Äî\n\nGarc√≠a is head of monitoring, evaluation and impact at the Cuban independent media outlet El Toque and is communications lead at the Transparency and Accountability Initiative",

Jose Enriquez, Mission Command Training Program, delivers remarks during the National Hispanic Heritage Month observance Sept. 20 at the Frontier Conference Center. (Photo Credit: Prudence Siebert) VIEW ORIGINAL\n\nFORT LEAVENWORTH, Kan. ‚Äî Maj. Jos√© Enriquez, an observer/coach/trainer with the Fort Leavenworth-based Mission Command Training Program, shared the impact of his experience growing up in Cuba and immigrating to the United States on the Mariel Boat Lift in 1980 during the National Hispanic Heritage Month observance Sept. 20 at the Frontier Conference Center.\n\nEnriquez began his remarks with a brief overview of Cuban history and the island‚Äôs proximity to Key West, Florida. Both factors are relevant to the influx of immigration that led his family and many others to the United States.\n\nEnriquez explained that Cuba‚Äôs previously free economy ‚Äî which included opportunities for employment, property rights and upward mobility ‚Äî belonged to a heavily corrupt government under the leadership of an elitist military dictator, Fulgencio Batista. Fidel Castro revolutionized the Cuban population against Batista and installed a Marxist‚ÄìLeninist one-party socialist republic on Jan. 1, 1959.\n\nIn 1970s Cuba, Enriquez and his family lived near the Port of Mariel, a deep-water port about an hour from Havana, the nation's capital. Enriquez explained that two years into Castro‚Äôs rule, families received annual booklets known as \"Libreta de Abastecimiento\" based on each family‚Äôs size and age through which they could claim supplies monthly at a registered store; the ration system is still in place today. In addition to necessary commodities. Enriquez said toys were also rationed. He said his grandfather ‚Äúdonated‚Äù acreage to the local government in order to keep part of his family‚Äôs land, including a vegetable garden, fruit trees and sugar cane that helped feed his family.\n\nGuest speaker Maj.

(Photo Credit: Prudence Siebert) VIEW ORIGINAL\n\nEnriquez said around 20 years later, the Cuban government actively persecuted anyone labeled counter-revolutionary or in dissent of Castro. On April 1, 1980, five Cubans sought asylum by driving a bus through the fence of the Peruvian embassy and Cuban police exchanged fire with embassy guards, expediting the push for mass emigration. Castro removed the guards there, and more than 10,000 Cubans crowded into the Peruvian embassy seeking asylum, prompting him to ask other nations to receive Cubans he deemed as undesirable.\n\n‚ÄúOnce it became known that you were planning to leave Cuba, you were immediately labeled a ‚ÄòTraitor to the Revolution‚Äô by the government and called an ‚Äòescoria‚Äô (scum). Your ration card would be confiscated; your job terminated; if you were in school, you would be expelled immediately. And by the time you left the Port of Mariel, any property you owned had already been inventoried and taken by the government. The Cuban government also organized acts of repudiation against those who wished to leave the island,‚Äù Enriquez said.\n\nBetween April 15 and Oct. 31 of 1980, more than 125,000 migrants traveled the 120 miles from the Port of Mariel to the United States on several hundred boats picking up Cuban refugees, including a 4-year-old Enriquez and his family.\n\n‚ÄúAccording to my Cuban passport, my immigrant Visa was stamped on May 13, 1980, which is the day we left, but I was not in-processed in Key West until May 18, 1980. I assumed it was due to procedural delay at Key West, but when I asked my dad and oldest sister if they can explain the gap, they told me it was because we were lost at sea for three or four days. It turns out that shortly after departing the Port of Mariel we ran into a bad thunderstorm and the captain lost his way,‚Äù Enriquez said. ‚ÄúBy then, we had run out of food, most of us were dehydrated and were on the brink, but once the boat captain finally made it back to the correct sea lanes, we were air-dropped rations by Coast Guard helicopters.‚Äù\n\nCuban-born guest speaker Maj.

Nobody claimed his family upon arrival in Key West, and after five days, they moved into the Miami Orange Bowl stadium. Enriquez and his family moved into a tent city under the I-95 overpass after a month at the Miami Orange Bowl without a sponsor. He described the refugee camp as dangerous; he said violence and crime, including rape and theft, were common.\n\nAfter another month, a distant relative claimed his family and they moved to Hialeah, Florida, until his parents moved the family to an apartment complex.\n\n‚ÄúHialeah in the early 80s was particularly dangerous and gang infested, and that apartment complex was the epicenter. It was so dangerous that it was nicknamed ‚ÄòVietnam.‚Äô If you told anyone in Miami that you lived in ‚ÄòVietnam,‚Äô they knew exactly what you meant,‚Äù Enriquez said.\n\n‚ÄúWe spent the better part of the 1980s moving, in the cover of night, from one apartment to the next before the deposit month ran out. Back then, you weren‚Äôt asked to leave and then taken to court; you were forcibly removed from the premises by police and your stuff was unceremoniously tossed into the street. It was not uncommon to see couches, TVs, and beds flying out from an upper-story balcony.‚Äù\n\nEnriquez emphasized his disdain for the place, but that he was still grateful to be in a different circumstance.\n\n‚ÄúDespite all that, life was good, and we didn‚Äôt complain at all. We were grateful for the generous monthly supply of government food, and we were given food stamps on top of that. It took us the whole month just to get through a block of cheese,‚Äù Enriquez said.\n\nGuest speaker Maj.

    "Cubans flee island‚Äôs economic woes by air, land and sea": "MIAMI (AP) ‚Äî One Cuban man endured a trek through eight countries that lasted more than a month. Another man paid a small fortune for a furtive speedboat trip. A third decided to risk a perilous passage aboard a homemade raft rather than stay a moment longer on the island.\n\nCubans are fleeing their country in the largest numbers in more than four decades, choosing to stake their lives and futures on a dangerous journey to the United States by air, land and sea to escape economic and political woes.\n\nMost fly to Nicaragua as tourists and slowly make their way to the U.S. border, often to Texas or Arizona . A smaller number gamble on an ocean voyage. Three men who survived the odyssey spoke to The Associated Press about it.\n\nTens of thousands of others share the same goal. From January to July, U.S. border authorities stopped Cuban migrants entering from Mexico nearly 155,000 times, more than six times as many as in the same period of 2021. From October to August, the Coast Guard intercepted more than 4,600 Cubans, an almost sixfold increase over the entire previous year.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe vast majority are released with notices to appear in immigration court or report to immigration authorities.\n\nIn all, it is the largest flight of Cuban exiles since the Mariel boatlift in 1980, when nearly 125,000 Cubans came to the U.S. over a six-month period.\n\nThe exodus is fueled by Cuba‚Äôs worst economic conditions in decades ‚Äî a result of tightened U.S. sanctions and a hangover from COVID-19.\n\nMassive street protests in mid-2021 triggered widespread arrests and fears of political oppression that prompted more to flee. An additional enticement emerged in November, when Nicaragua stopped requiring visas for Cubans to promote tourism.\n\nTwo of the three men spoke to AP on the condition of anonymity because they fear for the safety of relatives still on the island. These are their accounts of the trip:\n\n___\n\nCROSSING EIGHT COUNTRIES AND TWO RIVERS\n\nRolando Jos√© Cisneros Borroto, who worked as a street vendor in Camaguey, a city in central Cuba, said he was tired of going hungry and decided to leave his wife and three children in hope of finding a job in the U.S that would help sustain his family.\n\nBorroto, 42, sold everything ‚Äî his house, furniture and television ‚Äî to pay for the journey, collecting $13,000. His family stayed in another house that belongs to the wife.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAfter taking six flights, he finally arrived in Nicaragua in June. From there he went overland to Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico.\n\nHe crossed two rivers on an inflatable rubber ring, walked through mountains and along highways, and got rides aboard buses, cars and motorcycles.\n\nWhile hiding from Mexican police, he spent days drinking water from a river and eating only grass. He finally crossed into the U.S. south of Del Rio, Texas, and surrendered to the Border Patrol.\n\nBorroto was released after three days of detention and now lives in Algona, Iowa, where a cousin offered him a room in his house and food. The trip lasted 36 days.\n\n‚ÄúI never thought it would take so much work to arrive,‚Äù said Borroto, who was detained at least three times in Cuba for selling garlic in the streets. ‚ÄúWhat one goes through along the way I do not advise anyone, but Cubans prefer to die on the way before staying in Cuba.‚Äù\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA PROTEST, A PROSECUTION AND A SPEEDBOAT\n\nAnother Cuban man, 35, participated in protests in July 2021, when thousands of people across the island clamored for food and a change of government. He was tried on charges of public disorder and contempt and freed after 30 days in jail to await sentencing.\n\nHe fled in February, the month before he was to be sentenced to five years in prison. Air travel was out of the question because he would be stopped at the airport upon showing his passport. A raft was too dangerous.\n\nA speedboat ‚Äúwas the only way to escape,‚Äù the man said in an interview at the office of his Miami attorney, Wilfredo Allen. He left the island without telling his 5-year-old daughter. Only his wife, his mother and a brother knew.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nUnemployed, he asked his father, who lives in Texas, for about $15,000 to pay smugglers who gave him instructions over the phone.\n\nTwo days before the trip, he traveled 250 miles (400 kilometers) to Ciego de Avila, a city in the center of the island. From there, a bus picked him up along with 30 other people, and took them about 60 miles (100 kilometers) to one of the Cuba keys to board the speedboat. Among the migrants were a pregnant woman and a 7-year-old boy.\n\nThey passed through the Bahamas and, after 12 hours, arrived at an unknown place in the Florida Keys, at dawn. The boat stopped in a mangrove swamp. Then they came ashore, and several cars picked them up on a highway. A Cuban friend met him at a house where he was taken.\n\nA DESPERATE VOYAGE ON A HOMEMADE RAFT\n\nCubans who can‚Äôt afford a speedboat or the $10,000 to $15,000 for travel and smuggling fees to fly to Nicaragua sometimes flee on rafts made from pipes or wood.\n\nAmong them was a 37-year-old man who occasionally worked in construction and fished. He couldn‚Äôt pay a smuggler, so he built a raft of 10-foot aluminum tubes. In May 2021 he traveled with three friends for 22 hours until they reached south Florida.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n‚ÄúThe first thing one thinks of is leaving, that either we all die of hunger little by little, or we make an attempt,‚Äù said the man, who secretly constructed the raft over six months. ‚ÄúI knew I could die in the water, but I needed to take the risk.‚Äù\n\nHe built the raft alone and kept it hidden in bushes and mangroves. The same day of the journey, he purchased a small engine that allowed him to travel at about 6 mph (10 kph).\n\nNo one knew about the trip, except his three companions, his mother and his wife. For fear of being discovered, he told his companions the date of their travel just a few hours before they left.\n\nThey departed late at night, rowing out from a fishing port west of Havana, he said in a long interview at Allen‚Äôs office. With no GPS, they navigated by the stars.\n\nA whole day passed, and when night started to fall again, they saw the entry buoys to an island. They approached the coast and walked.\n\n‚ÄúAt least we‚Äôre alive,‚Äù he thought, but they soon realized that someone was calling authorities to report them. They immediately ran back to the boat and returned to the sea, fearing that they would be detained and deported.\n\nThey waited in the water for a while and later reached a beach in Key West, where a group of Cuban tourists offered to take them to Miami. The man called his wife to tell her that he had arrived safely and was on his way to his in-laws‚Äô house.\n\nHe is now seeking asylum and hoping to bring his wife and three teenage daughters to join him in the U.S.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Elliot Spagat in San Diego and Andrea Rodr√≠guez in Havana contributed this report.",
    "Humanitarian Crisis In Cuba: One Year On From The Anti-Government Protest": "In early July, 2021, thousands of Cubans took the streets in protest against the authoritarian Cuban government which was failing to not only combat the ongoing Covid pandemic, but also address the growing food shortages and severe blackouts plaguing the island country. Now a year later, trials for the 1,400 arrested and the ongoing fallout from the protests have raised concerns over human rights violations throughout the international community. Much of the concerns have centered specifically around the treatment of La G√ºinera, a poor and predominantly black neighborhood outside of Havana. Of the 700 who were given prison sentences, 100 were just from this neighborhood alone and the one casualty of the protests was a black man shot by the authorities in La G√ºinera.\n\nPrison sentences have been as high as 25 years ranging anywhere from accusations of vandalism to outright sedition. In an article by the BBC, a father of one of the convicted protesters spoke out about the severe injustice of many of the trials. His son, 22 and from La G√ºinera, has learning difficulties but was convicted of sedition and sentenced to 12 years of prison time, only allowing government witnesses to be used in the trial. Other instances included even false identification of protestors from obscured footage and trying large groups of people together at the same time. Even before the trials themselves, according to a report published by the Human Rights Watch, there have been instances of arbitrary detentions, abuse during prosecution, and even torture. Many in Cuba as well as the international community believe that the Cuban government is purposefully making an example out of La G√ºinera in order to discourage any other future uprisings.\n\nLeonardo Fern√°ndez, an arrested protester from another part of Cuba told the BBC, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs sad to see 20-year prison terms being handed down to 19-year-old kids. There are cases in which the sentences exceed the length of the convicted person‚Äôs life. It‚Äôs a human tragedy, and one which the international community needs to sit up and take notice of.‚Äù As the Cuban government prosecutes those who protested last July, it has ignored the reasons why the protest happened in the first place. The economic crisis has only worsened and now many have chosen to flee the island. According to the New York Times, migration from Cuba to the U.S. has reached its highest level in four decades. A longtime Cuban dissident told the New York Times, ‚ÄúHere, whoever doesn‚Äôt leave, it‚Äôs because they can‚Äôt.‚Äù\n\nAs human rights abuses continue to be committed in Cuba, the international community must take action to not only denounce and punish the actions of the Cuban government but to also provide critical aid to those who are fleeing. Between just this past January and May, more than 118,000 Cubans were detained in the U.S. compared to the 17,400 for the same time period last year. As the number of those who are detained rises, so does the overall number of people who are risking their lives in attempts to flee to the U.S. Action must be taken by the U.S. government in order to show its allegiance to the humanitarian plights of the Cuban people. This can be done through politics as well as further trade restrictions with Cuba. As for the refugee crisis, similar measures to those taken for Afghanistan and Ukraine should be applied to Cuba. As a close neighbor to the U.S. and as a country which has also had a complex relationship with the U.S., humanitarian aid measures should also be the same.\n\nSince the Cuban Revolution from 1953-1959 where the communist party of Cuba came to power, migration between Cuba and the United States has increased. The rise of Communism so close to U.S. shores sent a panic through the American government and people as the Cold War began. U.S. meddling during the Cuban revolution also put a strain on U.S.-Cuban relations. This gave birth to many of the policies with Cuba which still exist today, including the U.S. embargo. Harsh isolation of the Cuban economy wreaked irreparable damage to the country as a whole which has lasted into today. Though it was not the only factor, the U.S. did play a hand in Cuba‚Äôs current state.\n\nTherefore it is in fact in part the United States‚Äô responsibility to provide aid to the Cuban people. As the humanitarian crisis escalates in Cuba, similar approaches should be taken by the United States and other global powers to the international responses to both Afghanistan and Ukraine.",

China is convinced that Cuba will continually make new and greater achievements along the path of building socialism.\n\nChina and Cuba should further align their development strategies, Wang said, suggesting that the two countries steadily push forward cooperation related to pushing forward the Belt and Road Initiative, expand cooperation in such fields as agriculture, tourism and renewable energy, and turn the high-level political mutual trust between the two countries into more results in practical cooperation.\n\nRodriguez, for his part, wishes the forthcoming 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China a full success. He thanked the Chinese side for the enduring support for Cuba‚Äôs just cause, especially the solidarity shown and help provided when Cuba was hit by the COVID-19 pandemic and other disasters.\n\nCuba, the foreign minister said, is pleased with the deep friendship and political mutual trust that have been forged between the two countries‚Äô leaders. Havana supports the series of important proposals from the Chinese side, including the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative, he added.\n\nCuba will continue to firmly abide by the one-China principle and unwaveringly support China‚Äôs stance on issues related to Taiwan, Hong Kong and Xinjiang, Rodriguez said, adding that his country opposes any and all politically motivated anti-China moves.\n\nWang said the international situation right now is full of crises and chaos, but good prevails evil, unity is strength, and persistence leads to victory. China has full confidence in the bright prospect ahead for the progress of human society, and is willing to join hands with Cuba and other developing countries in strengthening solidarity and collaboration, upholding equality and justice, jointly tackling global challenges, and promoting common development and prosperity.",
    "Cuba holds unusual vote on law allowing same-sex marriage": "This is a carousel. Use Next and Previous buttons to navigate\n\nHAVANA (AP) ‚Äî Cuba held a rare referendum Sunday on an unusually contentious law ‚Äî a government-backed ‚Äúfamily law‚Äù code that would allow same-sex couples to marry and adopt, as well as outlining the rights of children and grandparents.\n\nCuba holds parliamentary elections every two years, though no party other than the Communist is allowed, but seldom has it held referendums on specific laws.\n\nAnd seldom has an officially backed measure met as much open criticism as the family law of more than 400 articles, which has been questioned by many members of the island's increasingly vocal evangelical community.\n\nThe sweeping code also would allow surrogate pregnancies, broader rights for grandparents in regard to grandchildren, protection of the elderly and measures against gender violence.\n\nPresident Miguel D√≠az-Canel, who has promoted the law acknowledged resistance as he voted on Sunday.\n\n‚ÄúMost of our people will vote in favor of the code, but it still has issues that our society as a whole does not understand,\" he said. Results of the referendum are expected on Monday.\n\nSixty-four-year-old market vender Miguel Alberto Galindo said he had voted for the measure: ‚ÄúIt's time that homosexuals have the same rights as everyone else,‚Äù he said.\n\nBut Alejandro Rodr√≠guez, a 33-year-old hardware store worker, said he'd voted against the measure, saying, ‚ÄúSome things in the code are good but others are bad.‚Äù He said he did not agree with giving gay couples the same rights as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù families.\n\nThe measure was approved by Cuba's Parliament, the National Assembly, following a thousands of government-organized information sessions this year in neighborhoods across the country.\n\nA major supporter of the measure is Mariela Castro, director of the National Center for Sex Education, a promoter of rights for same-sex couples, daughter of former President Raul Castro and niece of his brother Fidel.\n\nBut there‚Äôs a strong strain of social conservatism in Cuba, where evangelical churches have been growing. Several religious leaders have expressed concern or opposition to the law., worrying it could weaken nuclear families.\n\nWhile Cuba was officially ‚Äî and often militantly ‚Äî atheist for decades after the 1959 revolution led by Fidel Castro ‚Äî Raul‚Äôs brother ‚Äî it has become more tolerant of religions over the past quarter century. That has meant a greater opening not only the once-dominant Roman Catholic Church, but also to Afro-Cuban religions, protestants and Muslims.\n\nSome of those churches took advantage of the opening in 2018 and 2019 to campaign against another plebiscite which would have rewritten the constitution in a way to allow gay marriage.\n\nThe opposition was strong enough that the government at that time backed away.",
    "Cuba Demands at UNHRC the End of Unilateral Coercive Measures": "The island‚Äôs ambassador to UN-Geneva, repudiated the economic damage accumulated by a siege rejected year after year by the international community in the United Nations General Assembly, and described the human impact of this hostile policy as incalculable.\n\nCuba's ambassador to the UN-Geneva, Juan Antonio Quintanilla, called today at the Human Rights Council for the end of unilateral coercive measures, such as the U.S. economic, commercial and financial blockade against the island.\n\n‚ÄúUnilateral coercive measures are illegal and illegitimate, and from every point of view contrary to International Law and the Charter of the United Nations‚Äù, he stated when speaking during the debates of the 51st session of the Council.\n\nIn an interactive dialogue with the special rapporteur on Unilateral Coercive Measures, Alena Douhan, the Cuban diplomat denounced these actions directly attack the sovereignty of states, harm developing countries in particular and seriously hinder efforts for economic and social development.\n\nLikewise, they affect the promotion of the enjoyment of human rights of their peoples, and should not be considered as ‚Äúsanctions‚Äù, but as what they are, criminal unilateral acts of pressure and indiscriminate economic warfare, used by the powerful to try to achieve geopolitical objectives, he underlined.\n\nQuintanilla recalled in the forum that Cuba is one of the countries targeted by these actions, which, although they do not succeed in subduing the people, still cause a lot of damage and suffering, constituting severe violations of human rights.\n\n\"We reiterate the denunciation and rejection of the United States blockade, which impacts all sectors of life in my country, every day, for more than 60 years\", he stressed.\n\nThe health sector has remained one of the hardest hit by the blockade. The system of unilateral coercive measures imposed by the United States against Cuba violates the right to life and health of all Cubans. #UnblockCuba #CubaPorLaPaz pic.twitter.com/XkrGgu2Upm ‚Äî Mary Cary Balaguer (@Marycary1966) July 29, 2022\n\nThe island‚Äôs ambassador to UN-Geneva, repudiated the economic damage accumulated by a siege rejected year after year by the international community in the United Nations General Assembly, and described the human impact of this hostile policy as incalculable.\n\nWashington intensified its blockade in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic with at least 50 measures, of the 243 adopted by the Donald Trump administration (2017-2021) to increase pressure on the island nation, almost all of them maintained by his successor Joseph Biden,\n\n‚ÄúThe blockade is the most severe and prolonged system of unilateral coercive measures that has been applied against any country in history. Its ultimate goal is to impose a foreign political system on Cuba, and thus strengthen the agenda of imperial domination, in Latin America and the Caribbean, synthesized in the so-called Monroe Doctrine,‚Äù said Quintanilla.\n\nHowever, he ratified before the Human Rights Council that the island will not bow in the face of aggression and threats.",
    "The largest mass emigration in Cuba‚Äôs history continues": "A Cuban stands with his makeshift raft on a beach near Havana. ADALBERTO ROQUE (AFP)\n\nCuba‚Äôs latest migration crisis is breaking records. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) reports that in the last 11 months, nearly 180,000 Cubans crossed the US-Mexico border, and another 8,000 tried to make it to the United States by sea. In addition, the US Coast Guard reports that it intercepted 5,421 Cuban rafters trying to cross the Florida Straits since October 2021, and about 3,000 made it to US shores, numbers that exceed the total number of rafters detained in the last five years. The current Cuban exodus is unprecedented and far surpasses previous mass emigrations like the 1980 Mariel boatlift (125,000 people) and the 1994 Cuban rafter crisis (35,000 people).\n\nThe Cuban sociologists and economists we interviewed all agree that the hemorrhaging will not be stanched anytime soon and may even worsen due to deteriorating living conditions and economic hardship in Cuba. They believe that the current crisis is structural and that it will take years of investment, financial aid and radical reforms for the country to recover, measures that the Cuban government may be reluctant to take.\n\nMore information The US embargo against Cuba turns 60 with no policy change on the horizon\n\nCuban and US news outlets publish daily reports of deportations, shipwrecks, human trafficking operations and harrowing accounts of the land and sea journeys made by these Cuban emigrants. Hundreds have been killed by the mafias that control illegal migration in Central America and Mexico, while others have drowned at sea or crossing the Rio Grande. But this hasn‚Äôt deterred the desperate people who continue to leave Cuba.\n\nThe US Embassy in Cuba recently announced that the US is increasing patrols and enforcement by land, air and sea, as well as a new ‚Äúinteragency task force responsible for deterring, preventing, and responding to illegal maritime migration under Operation Vigilant Sentry. The primary objectives of the task force are to prevent loss of life at sea and to deter and dissuade maritime migration using Department of Homeland Security forces.‚Äù\n\nCuban television reporters recently interviewed several rafters deported from the US, including a young woman with a small child, who told how they nearly died at sea. They vowed not to try and emigrate illegally again, sending a clear message of deterrence to viewers. But it is unlikely that this will resonate with the desperate, exhausted and disillusioned Cuban people.\n\nThe crisis led Cuba and the US to convene a ‚Äútechnical meeting‚Äù in Havana between the Cuban Border Guard and the US Coast Guard to ‚Äúincrease bilateral cooperation‚Äù in combatting irregular migration, human and drug trafficking, as well as maritime search and rescue.\n\nThe official Cuban communiqu√© about the meeting said it was fruitful and conducted ‚Äúin a respectful and professional atmosphere‚Ä¶ Both delegations noted the usefulness of these meetings and the importance of increased cooperation in this area,‚Äù and agreed to hold more technical meetings in the future. In April, Cuba and the US resumed bilateral talks on migration issues, the first high-level discussions since US President Joe Biden was elected. The meetings had been suspended during the Trump administration, which reversed the Obama-initiated rapprochement between the two countries.\n\nImmigration has always been a key issue in the turbulent US-Cuba bilateral relationship. Over the last 60 years, several mass emigrations have ratcheted up tensions between the two nations. Cuba has used emigration as an escape valve during times of economic and political crisis, and also to pressure the US. But the magnitude of the current exodus is unprecedented, and led to historic anti-government protests on July 11, 2021. That date established a before-and-after point in time for Cuba, and the emigration numbers speak for themselves.\n\nIn fiscal year 2020 (year ending on September 30), 14,000 Cubans illegally entered the US across the Mexican border. In FY 2021, this number increased to 39,300. As of August 2022, almost 180,000 migrants have entered the US across its southern border. If the current pace continues, US officials say FY 2022 could close with a record 200,000 irregular Cuban migrants. The US Coast Guard data on Cuban rafters is equally alarming. The number of Cubans intercepted at sea bounced around for years (1,468 in 2017; 259 in 2018; 313 in 2019; 49 in 2020; and 838 in 2021), but in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, US officials picked up 5,421 Cubans at sea.\n\nThis is undoubtedly the most severe migration crisis since the Cuban Revolution triumphed in 1959. The problems in Cuba that are driving the exodus are equally severe and difficult to solve. There seems no end in sight for the widespread exhaustion and desperation of the Cuban people caused by economic hardship, draconian energy blackouts, runaway inflation, medicine and basic necessity shortages, and deteriorating health care services. Many young people feel that leaving is their only option for a better life, a scenario that will surely mortgage the country‚Äôs future.\n\nThe Biden administration does not want more irregular Cuban emigrants, and has recently launched several initiatives to resurrect the family reunification program and restore the consular services that Trump dismantled. But Cuban officials say that these measures are inadequate and accuse Washington of accelerating the flow of illegal emigrants by failing to comply with the bilateral agreement stipulating the granting of 20,000 visas annually to Cuban citizens. Cuba also says that the US has not complied with the Cuban Adjustment Act, which allows Cubans to obtain permanent residency a year and a day after entering the country, even if they entered illegally. Lastly, Cuba continues to blame US economic sanctions for all its problems. While both governments remain mired in long-running disputes, Cubans continue to suffer and the exodus intensifies.",
    "EXCLUSIVE Cuba seeks more electricity supply from Turkish powerships": "Companies S-Energy Co Ltd Follow\n\nHAVANA, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Cuba, mired in an energy crisis that has brought frequent blackouts, is negotiating with a Turkish company to have it double the megawatts it currently produces for the country from shipboard generators just offshore, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions.\n\nCuban officials are in talks with Karpowership, one of the world‚Äôs largest operators of floating power plants and part of the Turkey-based Karadeniz Holding, the sources said. The company already has five ships operating off Cuba with a capacity of around 250 megawatts (MW).\n\nThe Communist-run country needs to generate more than 3,000 MW to meet minimum demand and currently is producing between 2,000 MW and 2,500 MW.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nThe Cuban National Electric Union did not respond to a request for comment. Karadeniz declined to comment.\n\nThe sources, who asked not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the negotiations, said the talks centered on how to ensure lease payments from Cuba.\n\n\"The (U.S. trade) embargo makes Western financial transactions very difficult and Cuba is cash short and behind on payments with many suppliers and joint venture partners,‚Äù one source said.\n\nExperts say the Turkish company would need to add to its fleet off Cuba to produce the required amount of energy. Powerships carry their own generator fueled by oil or gas, anchor close to land and connect to the local electricity grid. They are leased by the host country.\n\nThe deal, if it moves forward, would provide quick and much-needed relief for the embattled Cuban government as power outages have spread across the island and increased in length.\n\nCuba is desperate for more electricity.\n\nThe energy crisis, with blackouts in 4 to 6-hour-blocks twice daily or more in most of the country, is perhaps the most painful symptom of a deeper financial crisis caused by external factors such as U.S. sanctions, the COVID-19 pandemic and poor economic management.\n\nCubans are also living through food, medicine and fuel shortages, forcing them to wait in long lines for the basics.\n\nThere have been scattered, small protests this summer and U.S. authorities registered a record of more than 175,000 Cubans at the U.S.-Mexican border since October, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency statistics.\n\nCuban power plants are obsolete, averaging 35 years of age, with a backup system of hundreds of smaller generators at least 15 years old. Just 5% of power comes from alternative energy sources.\n\nThe government blames lack of funds for its inability to update its decrepit grid, and says breakdowns, not fuel shortages, are the main cause of blackouts.\n\nEnergy and Mining Minister Livan Arronte Cruz said last week that the country hoped to all but eliminate blackouts by the end of the year, in part by adding ‚Äú531 megawatts to generating capacity through new investments,‚Äù a figure reduced to 450 MW by President Miguel Diaz-Canel at the weekend.\n\nOmar Ramirez Mendoza, deputy director of the state electricity monopoly, said on state-run TV that ‚Äú240 MW {of the 450 MW} will come from mobile generation,‚Äù a euphemism used by officials to refer to the powerships and coinciding with the source accounts.\n\nThe remainder of the new capacity would come from upgrading existing facilities with the help of foreign partners in the Moa nickel region in eastern Cuba and at the Mariel Special Development Zone just west of Havana, Ramirez said.\n\nJorge Pinon, Senior Research Fellow at The University of Texas at Austin‚Äôs Energy Institute specializing in the Latin American region, said he believed the powerships would provide the \"mobile generation\" referred to by Ramirez, but wondered how the extra capacity would be financed ‚Äúas the Cubans do not have any money.‚Äù\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nReporting by Marc Frank, additional reporting by Can Sezer in Istanbul, Editing by Dave Sherwood and Alistair Bell\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

    "WOLA Event: A Compounding Crisis in Cuba": "Join the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA) and the Center for Democracy in the Americas (CDA) for a discussion on the current crisis in Cuba\n\nAlthough Cuba‚Äôs government has sought to spur economic growth in recent years by shrinking the state sector, encouraging greater foreign investment, and expanding the private sector, the sluggish implementation and counterproductive nature of these measures and the ongoing crisis has enacted a deep toll on the quality of life of the Cuban people. Some of the economic measures aimed at the long-term improvement of the Cuban economy have had a dire impact on the ability of Cuban families to survive. In practice, the crisis has meant that Cubans are forced to endure hours-long energy blackouts and stagnated incomes, extreme inflation, and a lack of basic goods and services. The goods that are available on the shelves are often more expensive or in hard-to-obtain currencies such as the U.S. dollar. Lower-income families and Afro-Cubans bear the brunt of this as not all have equal access to foreign currency from abroad. Remittances are one of the top sources for Cuba‚Äôs hard currency and play a major role in the ability of many Cuban families and the private sector to survive the ongoing economic crisis on the island. As the Biden administration continues to hold back specifics on how its recent measures will successfully be implemented, Cuban-Americans and others continue to struggle to support their loved ones on the island.\n\nCuba‚Äôs economic crisis‚Äîdefined by extreme inflation, a shrinking GDP, the accumulation of social debts, goods shortages, high external dependency, and weak economic growth‚Äîleaves many questions about the island‚Äôs economic development and its future overall.\n\nOn Friday, September 9, 2022 at 10:00 a.m. EST, join the Center for Democracy in the Americas (CDA) and the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA) for a discussion with experts on the current state of Cuba‚Äôs crisis, how it differs from the special period in the 90s, and the island‚Äôs future overall. A Compounding Crisis: Domestic Shortcomings, U.S. policies, and the Impact on Everyday Cubans will explore weaknesses within Cuba‚Äôs economic model, recently announced economic reforms, the role of remittances and the Cuban diaspora, and how U.S. sanctions disproportionately impact Cuban families and the private sector while having relatively unchanged levels of impact on the state economy.\n\nREGISTER ON ZOOM\n\nEvent Details:\n\nFriday, September 9, 2022\n\n10:00 a.m. ‚Äì 11:30 a.m. EST\n\nPanelists:\n\nOscar Fern√°ndez\n\nCuban Economist and Entrepreneur\n\nAnamary Maqueira\n\nDoctoral Candidate in Economics at\n\nthe University of Massachusetts, Amherst\n\nDenisse Delgado\n\nDoctoral Candidate in Public Policy\n\nat the University of Massachusetts, Boston\n\nModerator:\n\nRicardo Torres\n\nResearch Fellow at the Center for Latin American\n\nand Latino Studies at American University\n\nThis event will be livestreamed via WOLA‚Äôs YouTube page.",
