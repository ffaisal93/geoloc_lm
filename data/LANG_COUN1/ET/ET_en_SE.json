    "Sweden proves it: The Left must change": "Sweden has got a new government, a bourgeois one but with the addition of the far-right Sweden Democrats.\n\nWhat does this mean for Sweden and perhaps even Europe’s future?\n\nThe most interesting issues for the Swedish voters in this election was gang violence, integration and, to some extent, electricity prices. There is no point hiding from the fact that the new right-wing alliance gave the most persuasive answers, which has in turn gotten them in power, to put it simply.\n\nSocio-cultural issues are more interesting than socio-economic ones and have given the Left very little space and success. The climate crisis has been turned into a background issue by politicians as much as by the media. Greta Thunberg’s perennial attention to politicians who postpone the problems to the future is proven true repeatedly.\n\nIt is not possible to call a million Sweden Democratic voters racists or Nazis and believe that they will then change their opinion and join a progressive and politically correct side that mocks them.\n\nThe techno-feudal situation with surveillance capitalism and how finance and capital have gone their separate ways and the old capitalism is about to be replaced by an even more remote and oligarchic order, no one even knows about and even less can choose to pay attention to.\n\nThe forecast is that people will continue to pay attention to what concerns the first level of human needs: safety and security, money that keeps flowing in, expenses that are not allowed to increase and passable highways free of sitting climate activists, because we want to get to work on time.\n\nIt is not possible to replace natural laws and, for example, believe that people whose children have been drawn into gang violence should first start thinking about what a post-capitalist world could mean. Nor is it possible to call a million Sweden Democratic voters racists or Nazis and believe that they will then change their opinion and join a progressive and politically correct side that mocks them.\n\nTen years of persistent grinding on the same strategy has been a disaster for the progressives in particular.\n\nCredibility, clarity and respect for people’s concerns are some human qualities that are always needed if you want others to listen to you – this also applies to grassroots democracy.\n\nThe question then is what DiEM25 could do in this crass political market where other parties in Sweden are increasing, where dissatisfaction is increasing and voter turnout is falling.\n\nThere is widespread dissatisfaction with people who see their petrol prices skyrocket because a few politicians believe that we must reduce fossil emissions.\n\nShake hands with them and say that we also think it is unfair and that we want the policy to compensate so that you are in the same boat when we have to help each other with the climate problem.\n\nThere is a hidden dissatisfaction with immigrants and the idea that they contribute to gang violence and shootings in the suburbs.\n\nShake hands with them and tell them we make no distinction when it comes to judging murderers. We can agree that everyone is equal before the law, while also admitting that certain communities need more help than others in order to be defended from a life of crime.\n\nNo progressive needs to lose their core values ​​if they want to approach our fellow unaffected citizens.\n\nToday, Swedish young people vote for Conservatives and the Sweden Democrats, the revolution is blue and if you want to use the momentum that has been built up, it is not time to withdraw and wait for another political wind.\n\nBeing progressive needs to be redefined. Several right-wing nationalist leaders in Europe welcome the Sweden Democrats’ success as a wave of nationalism that confirms themselves. A brave new progressive force may and must change this. A new progressive objective is necessary that can carve a new space for progressive politics among the Left’s old voting base as well as become a new attractive grass root magnet placing the current guardians of political status quo in the shadows.\n\nMats Sederholm\n\nCoordinator Stockholm Local Collective\n\nMember of DiEM25 Press Team\n\nWriter and active for Klimatalliansen\n\nEmail: mats@sederholm.nu\n\nDo you want to be informed of DiEM25's actions?

    "Poland welcomes right-wing election successes in Italy and Sweden": "Leading figures from Poland’s ruling camp, including Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, have welcomed the electoral success of right-wing and far-right parties in Italy yesterday, as well as in Sweden’s recent election.\n\nImmediately after exit polls last night predicted a victory for the Brothers of Italy (FdI) party – which sits in the same European grouping as Poland’s ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party – Morawiecki tweeted congratulations to Giorgia Meloni, FdI’s leader and the likely new Italian prime minister.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, with FdI predicted to win the election, Morawiecki had declared himself “happy that a tremor is running through the EU”, reported the Polish Press Agency (PAP).\n\nWith the likely new governments in Italy and Sweden – where the nationalist Sweden Democrats are now the second largest party – “watching the interests of nation-states…Europe is becoming a Europe of real values”, said Morawiecki.\n\nPiS chairman Jarosław Kaczyński had also declared Sunday to be “a day of hope, hope that the EU will start to change”, reports news website wPolityce.\n\nJarosław Kaczyński: Wybory we Włoszech? Jest nadzieja na to, że UE zacznie się zmieniać. Dzisiaj jest dzień takiej nadzieihttps://t.co/VFER1wme9V — wPolityce.pl (@wPolityce_pl) September 25, 2022\n\nMorawiecki’s predecessor as prime minister, Beata Szydło, who is now a PiS MEP, also tweeted congratulations to Meloni and FdI in Polish, English and Italian. Polish deputy foreign minister Paweł Jabłoński hailed FdI’s “historic victory”.\n\nDeputy justice minister Michał Wójcik, who belongs to PiS’s hard-right junior coalition partner United Poland (Solidarna Polska), said that Meloni’s victory was a “defeat for [European Commission President Ursula] von der Leyen, the representative of the anti-democratic forces in the EU”.\n\n“Abnormality in the EU is ending,” declared Wójcik. “The rule of manipulators and lunatics in the European Commission is slowly coming to an end.”\n\nPrzedstawicielka antydemokratycznych sił w UE von der Leyen doznała klęski. Prawica wygrywa wybory we Włoszech! Kończy się nienormalność w UE. Kończą się powoli rządy manipulantów i szaleńców w KE.\n\n🇮🇹🇵🇱 — Michał Wójcik🇵🇱 (@mwojcik_) September 25, 2022\n\nFigures from Poland’s ruling camp had criticised von der Leyen in recent days for suggesting that the EU would use “tools” against Italy, as it had with Hungary and Poland, “if things go in a difficult direction”.\n\nAnother United Poland figure, MEP Patryk Jaki, also hailed “Italians [for] not allowing themselves to be blackmailed by the EU” and achieving “a great victory for the right”.\n\nThe Polish government’s response was, however, criticised by opposition MP Agnieszka Pomaska. “The elections in Italy are won by…the post-fascist Meloni, the pro-Russian [Matteo] Salvini and the discredited Berlusconi,” she tweeted. “And the United Right [Polish ruling coalition] crows with delight.”\n\n❌Wybory we Włoszech wygrywa prawicowa koalicja z postfaszystowską kandydatką na premiera Meloni, prorosyjskimi Salvinim i skompromitowanym Berlusconim. A Zjednoczona Prawica na czele z Kaczyńskim pieje z zachwytu. Jaka partia tacy sojusznicy. — Agnieszka Pomaska (@pomaska) September 25, 2022\n\nBoth PiS and FdI are part of the European Conservatives and Reformists Party (ECR), which seeks reform of the EU in the direction of a looser union of sovereign member states and opposes further integration.\n\nIn recent years, PiS has also sought to forge closer links with Salvini’s Lega party, as well as other right-wing and far-right forces in the EU, such as France’s Marine Le Pen.\n\nHowever, since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine such efforts have been put on hold, publicly at least, given that those parties’ generally sympathetic position towards the Kremlin is at odds with PiS’s strongly anti-Russian line.\n\nMain image credit: Santi_ABASCAL/Twitter",
    "How The Local Sweden uses product thinking to remain \"useful\" to readers": "News organisations around the world are starting to pay attention to their readers’ needs and adopt a user-first model.\n\nThat is the case for The Local, a news outlet for English-speaking expats, published in nine European countries.\n\nIts Swedish edition uses reader surveys and audience data to create editorial products that its readers want and need.\n\nRead more: How BBC World Service engages younger audiences by fulfilling six reader needs\n\nSure, \"product thinking\" is a piece of jargon. What it really means, according to Paul O'Mahony, editorial product manager at The Local Sweden, is simply to make sure the publication is useful to its readers.\n\n\"Why do people buy products? It’s to fill a need or solve a problem in their lives,\" he said in a Journalism.co.uk podcast.\n\nThe \"product\" in product thinking can be anything, from a new article series to a podcast or a comic. The key to success is to provide your readers with valuable information they cannot find elsewhere.\n\nThe Local's membership is a good example, giving subscribers unlimited access to all nine editions. Throughout the pandemic, the news website has become a go-to source of coronavirus updates where authorities do not communicate in English a lot. Subscriptions have grown from 13k to 50k over the past two years.\n\nEditions from different countries collaborate all the time, swapping tips and stories, so individual publications can benefit from a much larger pool of audience data. One example of a successful new product launched in several countries is the \"Word of the day\" series that explains a local word to foreigners.\n\nAnother example is a monthly \"What changes\" article series where The Local Sweden informs foreign residents about upcoming changes in legislation or other areas of public life that could affect them. Originally created in France, the series was a hit with existing users and it also helped convert new readers into subscribers.\n\nProduct thinking is not limited to written articles. Podcast \"Sweden in focus\", created a year ago, answers listeners' needs with a solutions mindset. At a time when the right-wing populist parties are on the rise, O'Mahony is looking at projects that worked elsewhere and lessons we can learn from them.\n\nPodcasts are good for subscription conversions too; 65 per cent of listeners are paying members, of whom 60 per cent say the podcast makes them more likely to renew their membership. Among non-members, half say the podcast is making them consider signing up.\n\nRead more: 'Actionable user needs' make for more efficient newsrooms\n\nTo know whether a product is successful, The Local runs user surveys and makes changes based on readers’ feedback. The make-up of its team gives the publication a head start as most journalists are expats themselves and can use their experience to figure out what the readers may need.\n\nSurveys, on the other hand, tend to ask practical questions and often help journalists unearth new topics or angles they did not think about before.\n\n\"We had an email from a reader last week who said the cost of living made them reconsider their subscriptions. They are going to cut Netflix and a few other things but they said they will never cut The Local because that was their most important subscription. And that’s where we want to be in people’s lives.\"\n\nListen to the full Interview with Paul O'Mahony here.\n\nFree daily newsletter\n\nIf you like our news and feature articles, you can sign up to receive our free daily (Mon-Fri) email newsletter (mobile friendly).",

    "From Scotland to Sweden: How smart cities are helping residents save energy": "The university town of Umeå, in northern Sweden, is almost completely dark in winter. Encouraging residents to take public transport on cold, gloomy mornings requires some persuasion, but the city is more insightful than most about the needs of the people living there.\n\nAfter decades of applying a gendered lens to its travel surveys, the city knows that if everyone travelled like women, it would already have reached its sustainable transport goal for 2050.\n\nA bus stop was built with individual wooden pods to help women feel safer in public spaces.\n\n“It started a big discussion in Umeå,” project manager Carina Aschan says of the Station of Being, which uses distinct sounds and coloured lights to announce incoming electric buses.\n\nWhen a glassy note sounds, those sheltering in the Station of Being's rotating wooden pods know the bus to the glass factory is pulling in. RISE Sweden\n\n“It was meant to be an energy solution but it became a social solution too, and sparked a wider discussion about Umeå being innovative, and whether a city should do that.”\n\nDozens of smart solutions have been launched under an EU-funded project called RUGGEDISED, aiming to decarbonise three cities and inspire many more. As it draws to a close after six years, the question of what our cities can do for us, energy wise, has become more urgent than ever.\n\nHere are some of the brightest findings from the ‘lighthouse’ cities of Umeå, Rotterdam and Glasgow.\n\nWhat are smart cities?\n\nSmart cities sound futuristic but are built on some simple ideas around digitising our transport, buildings and other infrastructure. One way of thinking about smart solutions is working better with what’s already there.\n\nIn Rotterdam’s Heart of South experimentation area, the warmth from sewage water (which reaches up to 19C) will be recouped via a heat exchanger and stored in the thermal grid. Close by, tubes have been laid underneath the pavement to extract its heat (the concrete hits 65C in summer). In winter, warm water instead of cold will be pumped through them to melt the icy walkway.\n\nThe pavement heat/cold collector at the Ahoy centre. City of Rotterdam\n\nThere’s nothing flashy about this innovation, hidden below ground and around the back of the city’s Ahoy convention centre.\n\nBut it’s about results, and Ahoy has been fossil free since 2019. A carpet of thousands of solar panels on its roof supply the colossal energy needed for huge light shows, like Eurovision 2021.\n\nRewiring Rotterdam into a smart city\n\n“My dream is to have the built environment connected to sustainable energy sources,” Katelien van den Berge, Rotterdam’s RUGGEDISED project manager, tells Euronews Green.\n\nThe Netherlands’ second city was razed by German bombers during the second world war, so its eclectic architecture has relatively recent roots.\n\n“We do have an advantage because we have quite spacious public space,” explains van den Berge, making it easier to weave smarter infrastructure below roads and into the fabric of the city.\n\n“Rebuilding Rotterdam after World War Two, we had an empty inner city, it was all flattened and they built a district heating system” she says. “The ownership changed and the sources changed, but the system was already there, so that makes it easier to expand it.” Around 11 thousand homes are already connected.\n\nRotterdam's smart thermal grid being installed below ground. A new cinema in the Heart of South district will also be connected once it's built. City of Rotterdam\n\nHow smart solutions reduce energy demand\n\nKnowing more about the way energy flows through our cities also enables us to be more efficient in our use of it. Umeå’s most impactful solution has been better management of demand, says Aschan.\n\nAn intelligent set of sensors were installed in its university buildings, collecting data on human presence, temperature, light and CO2 levels. A smarter heating and cooling system followed which has achieved a 23 per cent drop in energy use during peak times across the campus.\n\nThe city’s university borders its hospital, and RUGGEDISED has sparked conversations between the two. Instead of building a new wing, the hospital realised it can use some of the empty university facilities at night. It may seem simple but using what is already there in a smarter way is what is needed in most cases.\n\nSmarter ways to use energy at home\n\nWheatley tenant Liz used to get up at night to run her washing machine, when electricity was cheaper. Now the new tech is saving her money and time. Peter Mohan\n\nThe main place that many city dwellers desperately need to save energy this winter is at home.\n\nThat’s not equally true across the continent. In Sweden, tenants have a right to a heated home and there’s no phrase for ‘fuel poverty’ (or warm banks). In the UK - despite Prime Minister Truss freezing bills at an average of €2,890 a year - 7 million households are still on course to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on fuel.\n\nTo alleviate the burden on some of its poorest residents, Glasgow City Council has partnered with Wheatley, Scotland’s biggest social housing group. Through RUGGEDISED, new devices have been installed on tenants’ electric storage heating systems, giving them greater control over the temperature in their flats.\n\nPeople are using around 20 per cent less electricity as a result, explains Wheatley carbon reduction and sustainability manager Colin Reid.\n\n“It allows us to interact with households, it offers them for the first time the ability to control heating in their own home when previously they were just the receivers,” he says.\n\n“It’s a courtesy for people that they can see for themselves how their home is operating.”\n\nGlasgow’s smart street\n\nGlasgow City Council is now looking at even bigger renewable energy projects, from covering capped landfill sites in solar panels to digging a borehole by the SEC. Getty Images/ TomasSereda\n\nIt’s often said that people make Glasgow and ‘people make Glasgow greener’ has become another call to action.\n\n“It’s part of the character of the city,” says Reid. “It’s got its issues and has a legacy of industrialisation, but on the whole Glasgow is a warm place. People want community with each other, so that’s a real asset whenever embarking on a just transition.”\n\nRunning through the heart of the city - along a stretch of George Street and Duke Street - is Glasgow’s flagship solution: it’s smart street.\n\nHere the council has trialled a range of measures, including lighting triggered when people walk past, a new solar canopy on the car park roof to charge EVs plus power storage, and district heating.\n\nWhen the world’s leaders descend on your city for COP, decision makers tend to take more notice, says Gavin Slater, head of sustainability at Glasgow City Council. Yet, “the city is a fundamentally better place” because of its participation in RUGGEDISED, he says.\n\nGlasgow has made great progress towards its net-zero by 2030 goal, Slater revealed. Carbon emissions have already been slashed by 50 per cent since 2006.\n\nDigital twins: How far can modelling data help cities get greener?\n\nIn Brno, the Czech Republic’s RUGGEDISED ‘follower’ city, residents can use the data platforms to see what savings they can make from installing solar panels on their roof. Euronews Green\n\nData is quickly transforming how we see our homes and streets, from an energy-saving point of view. Where there used to be one data point a year - someone coming to check your gas and electric - our homes are now a hive of numbers, notes Dr Marcel van Oosterhout from the Erasmus Centre for Data Analytics.\n\nPublic concern over how this data is used is, understandably, slowing its potential. The risk comes from how detailed a picture can fall into the wrong hands. Data about energy usage could be combined with addresses, giving a pretty clear indication of when people are on holiday.\n\nBut representatives from all three cities spoke in glowing terms about what ‘digital twins’ can do for sustainable planning. These are smart 3D models of the city that combine with real time data about how it’s functioning, explains Roland van der Heijden, programme manager for Digital City Rotterdam.\n\nThey enable residents to be brought into the planning process too. At the site of a new square, people can scan a QR code to create and judge designs, then use augmented reality to see how they will look.\n\nGeneric, scalable, maintainable data sources are key, adds van der Heijden. And it’s here that the private sector may have a big role to play. Google is drawing on huge data reserves to build up its environmental insights explorer (EIE) tool, totting up transport emissions, air quality and tree canopies.\n\nAnna Williams, a solutions lead in the tech giant’s Geo team, insists that “helping cities lower their emissions is our north star.”\n\nWhat are the limits on smartening cities?\n\nRotterdam's Ahoy rooftop. But residents with solar panels at home are currently unable to sell their energy to neighbours during peak times in the Netherlands.. Euronews Green\n\n“There’s no cookie cutter copy” to building smart cities, says Adriaan Slob, an expert at the Dutch research organisation TNO which has helped the cities with their sustainable transitions.\n\nA major challenge is that these smart solutions have to be implemented in existing urban areas, with their own messy webs.\n\nIn the Heart of South, Katelien van den Berge’s team could not get their smart electric grid off the ground. Though there are all the elements of smart lighting, electric vehicles and charging points, the city didn’t get the experimental status it needed to connect them, and a key contract bid for by energy partner Eneco was granted elsewhere.\n\n“There was no coordination between tendering on a city scale and implementing on a project level,” reflects van den Berge. And with no overall owner, there was noone to take responsibility for the grid’s success. No matter in a city as restless as Rotterdam; the team are taking their learnings to a number of other big urban development areas.\n\nWhere ambition has overreached itself, RUGGEDISED still provides some striking blueprints. But it’s clear that smarter connectivity is needed at a higher, legislative level too.\n\nAs for the energy crisis overarching citizen’s lives - in Glasgow and Rotterdam at least - van den Berge believes “there can only be a way up. I think this winter will be the bottom, and then we will start working on how we are going to tackle it.”",
    "Sweden mulls the cost to save communities from rising sea": "The low-lying farmland around the Swedish village of Skanör is highly vulnerable to rising sea levels | Charlie Duxbury for POLITICO\n\nPress play to listen to this article Voiced by Amazon Polly\n\nSKANÖR, Sweden — On January 4, 2017, a day of clear skies and light winds on Sweden’s far southwestern Falsterbonäset peninsula, the flood warning went out.\n\nRescue services scrambled to help motorists trapped on local roads after unusual winds offshore sent sea water surging toward the villages of Skanör, Ljunghusen and Höllviken.\n\nOne isolated cottage was partially submerged.\n\nBy around 8 p.m., the water was already receding, and while the villagers could breathe a sigh of relief, officials in the municipal offices the in nearby town of Vellinge were realizing that a bullet had just been dodged.\n\n“If there had been a strong onshore wind that day, it could have been a catastrophe,” said Carina Wutzler, mayor of Vellinge Municipality. “We would have seen a lot more damage.”\n\nThe pressing question for lawmakers in such areas across Europe and beyond is what should be saved and how, and at what cost to public budgets and the natural environment, from catastrophic events that are due to become more frequent as the global climate heats up.\n\n“I still get people saying that flooding is not going to happen, and I say to them it is already happening,” Wutzler said. “We need protection now, this is not something for 50 years’ time.”\n\nThe Falsterbonäset peninsula, which is covered by the Vellinge administration, is an affluent mix of high-end summer homes and commuter belt luxury living. It is one of 18 coastal spots on a Swedish government list of areas at risk of flooding as the climate warms, polar ice melts, sea levels rise and storms intensify.\n\nArguably the most vulnerable place on that list, the peninsula is a prime example of the type of low-lying European coastline, inhabited in many cases for centuries, which now suddenly faces an uncertain future.\n\nClimatologists and oceanographers are warning local lawmakers in exposed villages from Fairbourne in Wales to Germany's Halligen islands that new and potentially expensive challenges lie ahead as coastal flooding becomes more common and more damaging. Around half of the peninsula’s 8,800 homes stand on land less than 3 meters above sea level.\n\nEven under the very lowest scenarios for global greenhouse gas emissions between now and 2100, scientists expect sea level to rise between 28 and 55 centimeters. Under the highest emissions scenario, seas could rise by more than a meter. And projections from the European Environment Agency suggest that flooding events that currently come once a century to Skanör will occur six times more frequently by the end of the century.\n\nHard choices\n\nEuropean lawmakers aiming to hold back the sea generally look to the Netherlands, long the Continent’s gold standard in flood management.\n\nWith much of its territory below sea level, the country has already deployed a 3,700km string of flood defenses ranging from natural features like sand dunes to imposing feats of engineering like storm surge barriers.\n\nExperts say that as sea levels rise, a wider range of European leaders must now address similar challenges. But first, there's a more fundamental question: Should anything be done at all?\n\nIn Falsterbonäset, environmentalists had long pushed for little or no response to the rising flood threat, arguing that the area’s coastal meadows and beaches, home to many plants and animals, depended on their interaction with the sea for their existence.\n\nThe council for the county of Skåne, which includes Vellinge municipality, was also among those pushing back against building barriers through sensitive coastal ecosystems.\n\nSand dunes protecting the Swedish village of Skanör from the sea are expected to be breached more regularly over coming years | Charlie Duxbury for POLITICO\n\n“One of the big challenges, as the county council sees it, is finding space [for the barrier] without unacceptable intrusions into protected areas,” Maria Nitare, a water management official with the county council, said during a visit to Falsterbonäset.\n\nBut in 2014, Vellinge municipality decided to take a stand and began consultations for a plan to build a 20km long barrier of embankments, walls and dunes round the built-up parts of Falsterbonäset. The planned barrier was to be 3 meters high, relative to sea level.\n\nThe application was submitted in 2018 after discussions with a wide range of interested parties from local residents and business owners to oceanographers and climatologists.\n\nThe proposal was initially approved by planning authorities, but then, in a sign of what could be waiting for other Swedish municipalities facing the threat of flooding, the process stalled. There were objections from some that the barriers went too far and from others that they didn’t go far enough.\n\nOne particularly vocal group were local golf course owners, who have found to their consternation that they won’t be protected by the municipality's barriers.\n\nFalsterbonäset is home to several golf courses and is something of a national center for the sport. Visited on a recent weekday, the course in Ljunghusen was hosting a tournament for pairs of brothers to play against each other.\n\nClub manager Magnus Jivén described how in 2017, he watched in dismay as the sea crept closer to the front door of the clubhouse. To his relief, the building wasn’t flooded.\n\n“If you look at the Netherlands, they would build barriers out in the sea, but here the golf courses and the beaches aren’t being protected,” he said. “These places are some of the main reasons why people live here, so why not protect them as well as the houses.”\n\nOther objections have come from local residents who say the proposed embankments and walls will block their view of the sea as well as impinging on their privacy as people walking on the new embankments will be able to see into nearby gardens and houses.\n\n“The barrier is going to be right outside my fence,” Yvonne Lendrup, a Ljunghusen resident who has objected to the municipality plan, told national broadcaster SVT recently. “We’d really like to avoid this happening.”\n\nLjunghusen is seen as one of the most desirable places to live in Sweden. One house there recently sold for more than €5 million and on a recent weekday, two red Ferrari sports cars navigated the area’s narrow roads in quick succession.\n\nIn the early days of its flood barrier project in 2015, Vellinge Municipality estimated combined property values in Falsterbonästet at more than €5 billion and officials said prices have risen sharply since then.\n\nThe municipal council judged that if it did not provide a credible plan to protect the area over the coming decades, then residents and businesses could be expected to pull out as insurance premiums rocket and the risk of inundation intesifies.\n\nThe cost of the new flood defenses is expected to be around €19 million. Vellinge has applied to the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency for funding as well as to the EU via its Life program, but has said it will cover any shortfall through its own budget.\n\nTest case\n\nFor the other 17 Swedish sites judged by the government as at risk of flooding — including parts of the capital Stockholm and second city Gothenburg, as well as smaller towns like Kristianstad — Vellinge is proving an interesting test case serving to highlight gaps in the national response to the threat of climate change.\n\nAs Vellinge worked to develop its plans for flood barriers, mayor Wutzler said she had seen “surprisingly little interest” from ministers and other parliamentarians in the capital Stockholm and called on them to engage more closely with coastal communities facing existential threats from higher seas.\n\nA first report from a government-appointed expert group said Sweden’s response to climate change must be integrated more closely with other elements of the nation’s civil defense.\n\n“We must shift the focus from problems to solutions and from planning to implementation,” the report published in February said. “The efforts that have been made so far have not been able to create the necessary changes in society.”\n\nEnvironmentalists worry that building flood barriers through coastal meadows around Sweden's Falsterbonäset peninsula will damage important habitats | Charlie Duxbury for POLITICO\n\nIn June this year, the Swedish court of appeal responsible for environmental and land management ruled that construction of the barriers around Falsterbonäset could begin.\n\nWutzler said it was a relief and that construction of the first section of the barriers north of Skanör would begin within a year.\n\n“We are developing a solution so that we have an answer when we look ahead. Because when we look ahead, we see that the threat from flooding is only going to get worse,” she said.\n\nKarl Mathiesen contributed reporting.\n\nThis article is part of the Climate, Changed series.",
    "I don’t recognize Sweden anymore": "Jim Stenman is a Swedish-Ethiopian journalist. He has worked as a producer for CNN International in Europe and the Gulf, and reported for Reuters and the BBC World Service.\n\nAs Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson arrived in my childhood hometown of Eskilstuna recently, even she must have realized that Sweden was losing its war on gang violence.\n\nOnly a day earlier, the city had finally earned its title of “Little Chicago” — a term casually used during my teenage years, especially when describing rougher parts of town.\n\nThough I never took the analogy seriously, that day, one of those areas became the scene of sheer horror, when a woman and a young child were shot at a playground. Police have since linked the incident to gang crime, and thankfully, it didn’t result in any fatalities — both survived.\n\nWhile addressing the shooting, Sweden’s first female leader, who has been in office for less than a year, warned that criminal gangs now pose a threat for “anyone who happens to come in their way, even normal law-abiding citizens.” And she made a direct correlation between violence and a rise in the drug trade, which she vowed to have a national conversation about, and to crack down on crime by abandoning Sweden’s soft penal code.\n\nFor Andersson, talking tough on crime may be a necessity rather than a choice. Her center-left coalition government risks being voted out of office in the country’s general election tomorrow, as the vote takes place against a backdrop of a rising inflation and mounting fears over Russian aggression in the Baltic Sea.\n\nMany Swedes, as I do, feel the country’s heading in the wrong direction.\n\nA few months ago, three young men in neighboring Örebro were shot dead over the span of eight days, part of a wave of gang violence spreading across Sweden. And while I never expected the country to turn into a gangster’s paradise, it’s always been obvious to me that our approach to integration has been a ticking time bomb.\n\nBorn in the early 1980s, I witnessed firsthand just how difficult it can be to become part of mainstream Swedish society. My mother, an Ethiopian refugee, certainly ticked all the “right” boxes, such as marrying a local and accepting whatever jobs came her way.\n\nStill, she was never fully accepted as Swedish, despite having a near perfect command of the language and being clearly embedded within the culture.\n\nIt seemed to me that people like her faced an element of otherness that was difficult, if not impossible, to overcome. Moreover, many of my friends, some of whom were born to parents from the Middle East, chose not to identity as Swedish, despite being raised in the country.\n\nSweden, which had a largely homogenous population in the past, has faced serious challenges in welcoming non-European immigrants into its society. And I believe this may partly explain the difficult situation facing the country today.\n\nSweden experienced labor-based immigration in the late 1960s. And government data shows significant migrant arrivals from Iran in the late 1980s and Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. Immigration numbers then reached an all-time high in 2016, as the country, alongside Germany, opted for a largely open-border policy when it came to Syrian refugees.\n\nAs of 2021, Sweden had over 196,000 Syrian-born residents — a significant number for a country with a population of about 10 million. The total number of foreign-born people has rapidly increased over the last two decades, now amounting to 20 percent of the overall population. And though Syrians make up the largest group of immigrants, those born in Iraq and Finland also contribute to Sweden’s foreign-born population.\n\nPersonally, I don’t buy into the extreme belief held by some Swedes that immigrants largely come to our country to exploit its generous welfare system. But according to the European Commission, as things stand, the unemployment rate among foreign-born residents is more than four times that of native Swedes. It only stands to reason this breeds exclusion.\n\nAnd it’s perhaps not surprising that 2022 is on track to become the worst year on record for violence, with nearly 50 deadly shootings so far — a reality that’s proving a major headache for Andersson’s center-left coalition government, which has been in power since 2014. And her own Social Democratic party has overseen years, if not decades, of failed integration policy under previous prime ministers.\n\nOffering sanctuary to those fleeing war is always the right thing to do, but Sweden’s experiment with multiculturalism seems to have taken a turn for the worse since 2016.\n\nI’m not suggesting Syrians, or any other migrant group, should be held responsible for the rise in gang crime. It’s particularly worth highlighting that the Swedish integration model was failing long before their arrival, even causing some naturalized Swedes, including others with Middle Eastern roots, to support the far right in bid to limit further immigration.\n\nBut now, the country’s second largest party, the Sweden Democrats, is on a mission to restore what they perceive to be “traditional Swedish values.” Historically locked out of power due to other parties’ unwillingness to partner with them, they are projected to secure about 20 percent of the votes tomorrow, and they may be on track to play a key role in a possible center-right coalition that could end up ruling the country for the next four years.\n\nThis would mark their first time in government, and it would certainly prove a game-changer for the country. The party’s priorities include ending segregated neighborhoods, curbing organized crime and limiting immigration.\n\nThough I may morally disagree with closing our borders to those in need, perhaps it’s the best way to recalibrate — at least temporarily — after decades of failed policies.\n\nWhile it’s impossible to turn back the clock on immigration, Sweden must find a way to solve its integration problem before it’s too late. And the only way to achieve this is by recognizing present-day Sweden for what it really is — a multicultural society.\n\nWhile the far right is effectively pitching to make “Sweden Great Again,” I’m convinced we need to forge a more inclusive national identity that recognizes the demographic changes of recent decades, while also embracing the unique dual heritages now present throughout our country.\n\nIt is only by recognizing who we are that it’s possible to create a society that doesn’t breed exclusion or worse, crime.",

They were propelled to victory by the far-right Sweden Democrats, who secured more than one-fifth of votes and are now Sweden’s second-biggest party, despite a historically extremist reputation and neo-Nazi origins.\n\nNegotiations are now underway to form a new center-right government that will be headed by the Moderate Party, as the bloc previously decided. But experts say the Sweden Democrats are also poised to hold greater sway in shaping the future of Swedish politics, given the party’s clear popularity during the elections.\n\n“Because the Sweden Democrats are so phenomenally strengthened, actually power moves not just from one side to the other side of the political divide—it moves quite significantly to the right,” said Elisabeth Braw, an FP columnist and a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\n“It’s not clear whether they will be invited to be part of the government, but either way they would have a major role in parliament,” she added.\n\nAs issues of gang violence and immigration dominated the election, the Sweden Democrats vowed to drastically curb immigration, rattling civil society and immigrant communities. Jimmie Akesson, the leader of the Sweden Democrats, has pledged to “make Sweden good again.”\n\nWriting in Foreign Policy, Braw argued that the Swedish left’s negative campaigning ultimately helped catapult their opponents to victory. “Their fascist-scare rhetoric propelled the far-right Sweden Democrats to a stunning result … and helped the center-right bloc win an unexpected victory,” she wrote.\n\nAfter the election results became clear, Andersson announced her resignation on Thursday. Ulf Kristersson, the leader of the Moderate Party, is now set to create the country’s new government in a lengthy process expected to take weeks.\n\n“We have an election result. We have the mandate for change we asked for,” Kristersson said Wednesday. “I will now begin the process of forming a new government for Sweden and all its citizens.”\n\nWhat We’re Following Today\n\nMilitary support for Taiwan. The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee has advanced a bill to dedicate $6.5 billion in military support to Taiwan, a move that drew criticism from Beijing. Chinese officials said the bill conveyed a “serious false signal to the separatist forces of Taiwan independence,” as Reuters reported.\n\nMexico’s arrests. The Mexican government has arrested four people over the 2014 abduction and disappearance of 43 students from Iguala, Mexico, including a retired army general who oversaw a military base in Iguala at the time. Last month, a government truth commission declared that the case had been a “crime of the state.”\n\n“At all times the federal, state and municipal authorities had knowledge of the students’ movements,” the commission reported. “Their actions, omissions and participation allowed for the disappearance and execution of the students, as well as the murder of six other people.”\n\nKeep an Eye On\n\nRussian strikes in Ukraine. Ukrainian officials said they were able to contain flooding in Kryvyi Rih, Ukraine—President Volodymyr Zelensky’s hometown—after a Russian attack on a dam inundated the city’s streets with water, flooded homes, and forced others to evacuate.\n\n“Beaten by [the] Ukrainian army on the battlefield, Russian cowards are now at war with our critical infrastructure and civilians,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted afterward. “Russia is a terrorist state and must be recognized as such.”\n\nNigeria’s spiraling inflation. Nigeria’s inflation rates soared to a painful 20.5 percent in August—the highest level in 17 years—as shockwaves from the Russia-Ukraine war compound the country’s ongoing economic challenges.\n\nThursday’s Most Read\n\n• Russia Is Supplying Ukraine With Lightly Used Tanks by Jack Detsch\n\n• Putin Has a New Opposition—and It’s Furious at Defeat in Ukraine by Alexey Kovalev\n\n• Queen Elizabeth II Wasn’t Innocent of Her Empire’s Sins by Howard W.

    "Sweden announces emergency guarantees for energy companies": "PM says Sweden is facing the prospect of a ‘war winter’ due to an energy crunch amid the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nSweden has said it would provide several hundred billion dollars in liquidity guarantees to Nordic and Baltic energy companies to avert a financial crisis sparked by Russia’s Gazprom shutting the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline.\n\nPrime Minister Magdalena Andersson warned that Sweden was facing the prospect of a “war winter” because of Europe’s energy crunch, and said the exact details of the guarantees remained to be worked out.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Saturday, Andersson said the guarantees were aimed at giving energy groups “the breathing room that is needed”.\n\nShe said there was “a clear security policy agenda behind Russia’s actions”.\n\nMoscow has blamed sanctions imposed by the West following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine for impeding routine maintenance on the pipeline, but some European Union officials have accused Russia of using energy as a weapon.\n\n“Russia’s energy war is having serious consequences for Europe and Swedish households and companies, especially in southern Sweden which is dependent on electricity prices in Germany, which in turn is very dependent on gas,” she said.\n\n“This threatens our financial stability. If we don’t act soon it could lead to serious disruptions in the Nordics and Baltics,” she said.\n\n“In the worst-case scenario, we could fall into a financial crisis.”\n\nThe announcement came after Russia said on Friday it was cutting off the Nord Stream gas pipeline to Germany indefinitely due to what it said were leaks in a turbine – deepening Europe’s difficulties in securing winter fuel.\n\nThe closure is expected to lead to even higher production prices for electricity companies when the market opens on Monday.\n\nSpeaking at the same news conference, Finance Minister Mikael Damberg said the government will put forward a proposal that allows it to issue credit guarantees, adding that all of the country’s parliamentary parties and the speaker had been informed.\n\nDamberg also said the Swedish decision would “secure financial stability not only in Sweden, but in the entire Nordic region”.\n\nThe guarantees were expected to be in place on Monday before the stock market closing and would cover all Nordic and Baltic actors within the next two weeks.\n\nSweden’s parliament has been called in from its summer break to hold a vote on the government’s proposal on Monday.\n\nSweden is experiencing its highest inflation in 30 years, and the central bank has raised rates twice this year, with more steep hikes expected before yearend.\n\nSoaring electricity bills, rising interest rates and stalling economic growth have dominated campaigning ahead of the general election on September 11.\n\nOn Wednesday, Damberg said the government expected to have $8.36bn available to help ease consumers’ pain of record electricity prices this year and next.",

The match was played at Girona in Spain.\n\nIt was the first match of the exposure tour for the Indian girls ahead of the age-group showpiece, which India is hosting in October-November. Sudha Tirkey (62′) scored the only goal for India after Sweden U-17 girls took a comfortable 3-0 lead through Ida Gramfors (44′) Sara Frigren (52′) and Selma Astrom (54′). India, however, looked promising at the start as they competed on equal terms in an intense midfield battle that saw winger Anita Kumari get an early shot at the rival goal, which was saved.\n\nMinutes later, Nitu Linda tried her luck to take a shot from the edge of the Swedish penalty area, but was blocked.

    "Your guide to Sweden’s fringe-driven general election": "The eyes of the world have been on Sweden during its bid for NATO membership. But as voters in the Nordic nation head to the polls for a September 11 general election, domestic issues will be their primary concern.\n\nWith gang-related violence spiking in recent years, security, justice, and the failure of immigration policy are top election issues. Crime and migration are closely linked in voters’ minds, with lax migration policies often blamed for rising violence in Swedish suburbs. Many political leaders campaign on harsher criminal sentencing and an expansion of police powers as solutions to reduce crime.\n\nIn fact, it was dissatisfaction with the Social Democratic justice minister that nearly toppled the government just two weeks after Sweden submitted its application for NATO membership.\n\nBut this election won’t be straightforward. Just as during the previous general election in 2018, neither the traditional center-left nor center-right blocs will likely have enough seats in parliament to form a governing coalition. What has changed in recent years, however, is the willingness of traditional parties to govern with the support of the far-right Sweden Democrats, which are polling at 20.4 percent against the ruling Social Democrats’ 29.8 percent.\n\nAllowing the Sweden Democrats to influence government decision-making would break a long-standing taboo. However, if the traditional center-right parties hope to achieve a change in government after eight years of Social Democratic rule, negotiating with the far-right newcomers who enjoy historically high levels of support will be a political and numerical necessity.\n\nWhat NATO and the EU are watching\n\nWhile the domestic debate over Sweden’s NATO membership is settled, the election results may determine how active a role Stockholm will play within the Alliance and the European Union (EU) more broadly.\n\nFor the first time in recent memory, security and defense became a top campaign issue for voters, and party leaders still measure their words carefully when talking about Turkey to avoid agitating Ankara—whose veto power could still derail Stockholm’s NATO bid. How to pay for increased defense spending is on the agenda, but with rising inflation and energy prices, many parties are opposed to making voters’ costs of living even more expensive with a special defense tax that the Social Democrats have proposed.\n\nThe Social Democrats have broken with their longstanding tradition of upholding military non-alignment. Yet a future center-left government could see its level of engagement in NATO hampered because it would include the Green Party and rely on the support of the Left Party in Parliament—and both parties opposed joining the Alliance.\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, members of the center-right bloc are strong supporters of NATO and greater investment in Sweden’s military capabilities. But such a coalition would need the support of the EU-skeptical Sweden Democrats. With Sweden chairing the EU presidency during the first six months of 2023, this may set up roadblocks toward greater EU cooperation at a pivotal moment for the continent.\n\nWhile the mainstream parties have sought to limit the influence of these two fringe parties, political redlines and campaign promises may fall by the wayside given the numerical realities after election day. Both the Left Party and Sweden Democrats will seek maximalist policy gains in exchange for allowing a government to form.\n\nEveryone’s a kingmaker\n\nSweden’s system of negative parliamentarism means that a government does not need a parliamentary majority. As long as a majority is not against a government, parties can let a government form with their passive support through abstaining. This occurred in 2018 when the Social Democratic and Green coalition signed the so-called “January agreement” with the Center Party and Liberals, who wished to prohibit the far-right Sweden Democrats from gaining influence.\n\nSince then, the Social Democrats have maintained a precarious coalition marked by numerous twists and turns: Sweden’s first-ever no-confidence vote against a prime minister that successfully toppled the government in mid-2021; the resignation several months later of Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson on her first day in office after losing her Green Party coalition partners over potential Sweden Democratic influence over passing a budget; Andersson’s subsequent re-election to lead a one-party government days later; and the narrow survival of a second no-confidence vote less than a year later.\n\nThis year is shaping up to be no less complicated. Forming a government will be equal parts politics and math. Unlike in Germany, a grand coalition between the two largest parties has not been politically feasible. Decades of nearly uninterrupted Social Democratic rule has shaped the identity of the Moderate Party, traditionally Sweden’s second-largest party, as staunch opponents of socialism. Conversely, the Social Democrats’ sheer size has never required them to reach across the aisle; only now, while occupying a historically weak position, have they left the door open to governing with the Moderates, though it is not their “first-hand choice.”\n\nIt will be up to the smaller parties—all of which have conflicting interests and different stances on cooperating with the political fringe—to play kingmaker.\n\nRecent polling also indicates that the Sweden Democrats have overtaken the center-right Moderates to become Sweden’s second-largest party. If the Sweden Democrats do finish second, the mainstream political calculus will become even murkier. Leaders have become coy about answering with whom they would build a government as election day draws closer.\n\nAhead of this weekend’s election, here’s what you need to know about the dynamics in each party:\n\nFrom pariah to partner: The Sweden Democrats (polling at 20.4 percent)have experienced a meteoric rise over the past two decades, from gaining only 0.4 percent of the vote in 1998 to becoming Sweden’s third-largest party in 2018. This boost in popularity mirrored a trend across Europe in which far-right populist parties seized on voters’ discontent over rising levels of migration and crime. For years, because of the party’s anti-migration rhetoric and policy, cooperating with the Sweden Democrats was political taboo. Accusations over the party’s neo-Nazi roots in the early 1990s, as well as its continued racism, led it to commission an independent study in July about its own founding and ideological development. According to the author, a majority of the party’s founders had connections to “neo-Nazi, racist, or undemocratic movements.” Party leader Jimmie Åkesson has stated that his party has become politically accepted among voters, having moderated many of their policies and expunging radical members of the party. Center-right leaders, who will need at least the Sweden Democrat’s passive support, also believe the party has changed. But recurring incidents of Sweden Democrats spreading Russian and right-wing propaganda has led many to question this claim; Defense Minister Peter Hultqvist went so far as to hold a press conference just ten days before the election on the national-security risks the Sweden Democrats pose. Åkesson has said he will make “extremely tough demands” upon the Moderates in exchange for his party’s support.\n\nThe (polling at 20.4 percent)have experienced a meteoric rise over the past two decades, from gaining only 0.4 percent of the vote in 1998 to becoming Sweden’s third-largest party in 2018.

Struggling socialists: After suffering their worst election results in more than a century during the 2018 election (28.3 percent), support for the Social Democrats (29.8 percent) has somewhat recovered since Andersson took office in November 2021. As Sweden’s first female prime minister, she has navigated her party—Sweden’s largest and longest-ruling—through a radical transformation on its position toward NATO, upending two hundred years of military non-alignment. The Social Democrats’ first choice is to form a center-left coalition with the Greens and Center Party, which means the continued exclusion of the Left Party in government while relying on its tacit support. Andersson has left open the possibility of a centrist coalition with the Moderates, as they have closely worked together on security issues since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAfter suffering their worst election results in more than a century during the 2018 election (28.3 percent), support for the (29.8 percent) has somewhat recovered since Andersson took office in November 2021.

Party leader Annie Lööf recently said that she aims to form a coalition with the Social Democrats, but that such a government cannot include the Left Party.\n\nAs the name suggests, the (6.6 percent)has called for a broad centrist coalition, rejecting support from both the Left Party and Sweden Democrats. It remains the sole member of the former “Alliance” to continue passively supporting the Social Democrats but faces internal division over this stance. The party has also grown critical of the Moderates’ rightward turn. The Social Democrats need the Center Party to form a center-left government, but substantial negotiation with the Left Party will be required to smooth over differences. Party leader Annie Lööf recently said that she aims to form a coalition with the Social Democrats, but that such a government cannot include the Left Party. Aiming for influence: The Left Party (8.4 percent) is the former Communist Party of Sweden. It remains opposed to Sweden’s accession to NATO and may play spoiler in Social Democratic foreign policy if they form a coalition. The party has already caused problems for Sweden’s NATO accession after pictures emerged of parliamentarians posing with flags of the militant Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). The photos handed Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan easy political points and caused headaches for Swedish diplomats when negotiating the terms of agreement for approving NATO membership (which included greater cooperation on combatting terrorism). The party has demanded to be a member of a center-left coalition, or else it will withdraw support for the Social Democrats. After feeling repeatedly steamrolled by the center-left coalition despite their passive support, it was the Left’s de-facto cooperation with the Sweden Democrats over housing policy that brought down the government in 2021.\n\nThe Left Party (8.4 percent) is the former Communist Party of Sweden.

Tactical play: For months, the Greens (5.2 percent), who also oppose NATO, were teetering on the verge of missing the 4 percent threshold to enter parliament. As election day has drawn closer, support for them has steadily increased; many Social Democratic voters will vote Green instead, ensuring the much smaller Green Party passes the threshold needed to stay in parliament and lend its support to the Social Democrats in a center-left coalition.\n\nA generational election\n\nNearly every election is billed as high-stakes. In 2022, that may actually be true: The new government will be responsible for Sweden’s first steps into NATO. After two hundred years of military non-alignment, decisions taken today about the type of ally Sweden will be within NATO will set the course for the nation’s relationship toward Europe and the transatlantic community for a generation.\n\nAaron Korewa is the director of the Atlantic Council’s Warsaw office.\n\nEric Adamson is a project manager at the Atlantic Council’s Northern Europe office in Stockholm.\n\nFurther reading\n\nRelated Experts: Aaron Korewa\n\nImage: Sweden Democrats leader Jimmie Akesson and Jessica Stegrud attend a campaign rally in Vasteras, Sweden, on September 7, 2022.

    "Sweden taking Turkey 'seriously' on Nato demands": "Sweden and Finland are counting on further talks with Turkey to unlock their Nato accession, as Western diplomats wonder what Ankara really wants.\n\n\"The Swedish government takes the implementation of the memorandum very seriously,\" the Swedish foreign ministry told EUobserver on Thursday (15 September), referring to a deal made in June with Turkey to go after alleged Kurdish terrorists in return for Nato entry.\n\nStudent or retired? Then this plan is for you.\n\n\"Further meetings in the trilateral format between Sweden, Finland, and Türkiye are foreseen,\" the Swedish ministry said, following the last such talks on 26 August.\n\nFinland is also \"working together with Türkiye to organise further meetings at expert level,\" its foreign ministry said.\n\nThey spoke after Turkish foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoglu warned one day earlier the Turkish parliament wouldn't ratify the Nordic Nato bids if they didn't play ball. \"No concrete steps have been taken up to today,\" by Stockholm or Helsinki to satisfy Ankara, he declared.\n\nFinland and Sweden are joining the Western alliance to protect themselves from Russia, in a tectonic shift in European security in reaction to the Ukraine war.\n\nSome 24 out of 30 Nato members have already ratified the move in the fastest-paced accession process in its history, showing the overwhelming support for Nordic enlargement.\n\nBut Turkey first wants Sweden to extradite 73 Kurdish separatist suspects and for Finland to hand over 12 more.\n\nIt also wants them to tighten national terrorism laws and to sell Turkey high-end weapons systems, in demands which are being fulfilled.\n\nÇavuşoglu's warning was prompted by the formation of a new right-wing government in Stockholm, including the far-right Sweden Democrats party, following elections last Sunday.\n\nBut the Sweden Democrats endorse Nato entry, and right-wing Swedish voters will likely be more comfortable with extraditing Kurdish exiles than supporters of the outgoing centre-left government would have been.\n\nAnd despite Çavuşoglu's tough talk, few in the EU or Nato think Ankara expects to get everything it wants.\n\nTurkey's demands on Finnish extraditions, for one, could easily melt away because they are largely symbolic. \"There is no PKK in Finland,\" an EU diplomat said, referring to a leading Kurdish militant group.\n\nTurkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's \"frustration\" with Sweden giving safe harbour to so many Kurds was more \"real\", Jamie Shea, a former senior Nato official, told this website.\n\nBut given the high burden of proof from Turkey that Swedish courts will require to substantiate terrorism charges, \"it is highly unlikely that all the individuals on Ankara's list will be handed over\", Shea also said.\n\n\"Erdoğan knows that he cannot stop the [Nato enlargement] process indefinitely, whatever the rhetoric from Ankara, and so my sense is that he will declare victory after a few symbolic extraditions and lift his objections,\" Shea said.\n\nTurkish elections\n\nThat still leaves the question of when Erdoğan might budge.\n\nFinland and Sweden are not covered by Nato's mutual defence clause until the day they join, amid concern over the potential for a sudden flare-up in Russian aggression in the Baltic region.\n\nBut Erdoğan is preparing to fight elections in June next year amid an economic slump in Turkey, and his spin-doctors might want to drag out the Nato dispute as long as possible for campaign reasons, the EU diplomat said.\n\n\"It makes him [Erdoğan] look like an important player on the world stage,\" the diplomat noted.\n\n\"It also has a rallying-round-the-flag effect on Turkish nationalists and on those large portions of Turkish society where anti-Americanism is rife,\" he said.\n\n\"Erdoğan has other cards to play, such as creating a new migration or Mediterranean gas-drilling crisis with Greece,\" the diplomat added. \"His people are obsessed with opinion polls, and they'll be frantically doing surveys to see how each of his moves plays out,\" the EU diplomat said.\n\nTurkey sent thousands of Syrian refugees to the Greek border two years ago. It dispatched a ship in August to resume gas exploration in an area criss-crossed by rival territorial claims.\n\nMeanwhile, the Finnish and Swedish bids are proceeding so swiftly because they already became de facto Nato members in military-technical terms during years of close cooperation.\n\nThere is very little left for Nato itself to do to wrap up the process following member states' ratifications, Shea, who now teaches war studies at the University of Exeter in the UK, said.\n\nThis includes tweaking its budget and legal documents.\n\n\"Nato commanders will need to revise their contingency plans for the defence of Europe to cover Swedish and Finnish territory, which includes islands in the Baltic Sea,\" Shea said.\n\n\"They will also be proposing Swedish and Finnish military contributions for the defence of other allies. But again, given the recent closeness of Sweden and Finland to Nato, they probably finalised these plans, at least informally, months or even years ago already,\" he said.",

    "7 Fascinating Facts About Gothenburg, Sweden’s Second City": "As Sweden's second biggest city, Gothenburg has a rich cultural life but a more relaxed pace than ... [+] the capital city Stockholm. getty\n\nIn many ways Gothenburg could be considered the heart of Scandinavia. It’s Sweden’s second biggest city, has a 3.5-hour ferry connection to Denmark and is just a 2-hour drive from Norway.\n\nFrom its status as a global leader in sustainability to a fascinating history of trade and innovation, there’s a lot to discover about Gothenburg. Here are seven fascinating facts about this thriving Scandinavian city.\n\nThe city isn’t actually called Gothenburg\n\nIn Swedish the city is named Göteborg, roughly pronounced yaw-ta-bore(g). This surprises many international visitors as all other Swedish cities use the same name in both languages. To add to the confusion, many business in Gothenburg use the English version in their name.\n\nThe city council has changed its mind over the years about its own branding. In 2003, it was decided to promote the name Göteborg, a decision which was reversed just six years later. Now Gothenburg is the preferred choice for all international communications.\n\nIt’s the fifth largest city in the Nordic region\n\nWhile Gothenburg plays second fiddle to Stockholm in Sweden, it’s a big player in the context of the wider Nordic region.\n\nGothenburg is the fifth largest city in the Nordic region. Getty\n\nWith almost 600,000 people living in the city and about 1.1 million people in the wider urban area, Gothenburg is the biggest Nordic city that’s not the capital of its country. It’s also significantly bigger than Iceland’s capital, Reykjavik.\n\nGothenburg was built by the Dutch\n\nAlthough people have lived in the area for thousands of years, the city of today was founded in 1621 by the King of Sweden. However, the city’s early success relied on construction expertise from the Netherlands.\n\nBased on the Dutch experience of building on marshlands and constructing canals, the planning of Gothenburg’s streets and necessary canals followed that of Amsterdam and Dutch colonies of the time, particularly Batavia (now Jakarta).\n\nThe city is a leader in innovative transport\n\nIn 1927, the first Volvo car rolled off the production line in Gothenburg. Since then, Volvo went on to become a global leader in people-first and safety-first design.\n\nThe Volvo Museum exhibits products from the whole Volvo range, including cars, trucks and buses. getty\n\nWhile Volvo Cars was sold to Ford in 1999, Gothenburg remains the headquarters of the Volvo Group that continues to manufacture trucks and buses including new 44-ton electric trucks. The city’s Volvo Visitor Center and Volvo Museum tell the story.\n\nToday, Gothenburg is writing a new chapter in its transport story. Leading electric aircraft developer Heart Aerospace has chosen Gothenburg as its base to create the so-called Northern Runway, a campus of production and flight test facilities.\n\nGotheburg is twinned with Chicago\n\nOf Chicago’s 28 sister cities, Gothenburg is the only one in the Nordic region. Launched in 1960, the sister cities program works on collaborations in the areas of cultural arts and tourism, global education, government relations and international business.\n\nGothenburg is a sustainability leader\n\nA committment to sustainability is a thread that runs through every aspect of life in Gothenburg, from business to tourism. In 2021, Lonely Planet recognized Gothenburg as the world’s most sustainable city break, while the Global Destination Sustainability Index ranked Gothenburg as the world’s most sustainable destination five years in a row.\n\nGothenburg was the first city in the world to issue green bonds to stimulate investment in solutions to climate change. Almost all the city’s hotels are eco-certified and plans to develop a zero-emissions transport zone in the downtown district are well underway.\n\nThe city’s archipelago is vast\n\nAbout 5,000 people live on Gothenburg’s southern archipalego, but that number rises to more than 10,000 during the summer months.\n\nBoats and bicycles are the primary form of transport in Gothenburg’s southern archipelago. getty\n\nMany Swedes own vacation cottages and spend several weeks on one of the islands, while many more spend weekends there throughout the year.\n\nIn keeping with the city’s sustainability focus, the southern archipelago is entirely car-free. Ferries connect people with the mainland, while bicycles and delivery mopeds are used on the islands.\n\nWhile the islands are forward-thinking, they are also steeped in history. Mentioned in Norse sagas as ‘the river islets’, the southern islands appear to have been used as a location for fairs and duels in the Viking Age.\n\nThe northern archipelago shares much in common with its southern sibling, but has bigger islands and communities accessible by car via the car ferries from Lilla Varholmen. The weekend ferry to Hönö Klåva from downtown Gothenburg is especially popular.",

This is a strong sign of confidence in Malaysia and demonstrates that despite the impact of Covid-19, Malaysia will continue to be an attractive destination for Swedish companies to invest and grow in Asia,” said the report.\n\nIt observed that Swedish companies experienced higher profitability in 2021, than in 2019.\n\n“66% of the Swedish companies [were] profitable in 2021, compared to 61% in 2019. Similarly, the number of companies operating at a loss has decreased from 20% in 2019 to 7% in 2021,” said the report.\n\nMost respondents have a neutral or positive perception of the current business climate in Malaysia, with 46% “neutral” and another 44% perceiving the climate as “good” or “very good”.\n\nComparably, the number of companies expressing that the business climate is “poor” or “very poor” decreased to 7% in 2022, from 11% in 2020.\n\nAbout 53% of the companies that responded to the survey have more than 1,000 global employees.\n\nThe respondents come from a wide range of industries. Industrial companies represent the largest sector at 47%, followed by professional services at 38%, and consumer companies at 16%.\n\nWhile most Swedish businesses in Malaysia remain focused on Peninsular Malaysia and have limited activities in Sabah and Sarawak, two out of three respondents have a plan to grow their business in the two Borneo states.\n\n“Some see great potential in the area, while others are more sceptical of the opportunities. Several respondents stated that they have not investigated the region yet, but that they see the growth and need to start developing a presence soon,” the report said.\n\nThis report also highlighted that Swedish companies perceive “personal safety”, “access to distributors”, and “service providers” to be key advantages in doing business in Malaysia.\n\n“However, concerns and challenges highlighted in the 2020 survey remain in place today. The lack of transparency, unsatisfactory labour market regulations, and finding skilled labour locally continue to be big struggles for Swedish companies present in Malaysia,” it added.\n\nA number of companies expressed concerns regarding the ability to bring in specialised staff from abroad.\n\n“It is noteworthy that the companies that experienced difficulties in bringing in specialised staff from abroad were also more likely to respond that they would not invest more in Malaysia, indicating improved visa arrangements would go a long way towards attracting more Swedish investment,” the report said.\n\nSome 77% of the companies surveyed said they had not experienced bribery or fraud, and 86% said they had not witnessed human or labour rights abuse.\n\nIn total, there are about 90 Swedish companies based in Malaysia.\n\nIn her presentation, trade commissioner Brooms said Swedish exports to Malaysia amounted to US$400 million in 2021, while Malaysian exports to Sweden reached US$600 million.",

After a couple of minutes, she decided to leave.\n\n“We are terrified to be here,” said the woman, a 33-year-old who didn’t want to give her name because she feared reprisals for criticizing local criminals. “This isn’t the first time there has been a shooting in this area.”\n\nEscalating violence\n\nThe playground is in the suburb of Årby, the base of a local narcotics-dealing gang, which local authorities say is locked in a deadly rivalry with a group from Skiftinge, another suburb a couple of kilometers away.\n\nInitially a clash over control of drug markets, officials say the rivalry has intensified as slights and attacks by one side have been met in kind by the other in an escalating spiral of violence.\n\nLocal police chief Mikael Backman told the media after the shooting that, a week earlier, his officers had confiscated “half a dozen” weapons and arrested six people.\n\n“We are coordinating resources from all over the country,” Backman said. “But the problems right now are so serious that we have trouble keeping up as we are having to prioritize so many serious crimes at the same time.”\n\nStatistics to mid-August show that 44 people have been shot dead in Sweden this year and 66 wounded. In all of 2021, 45 people were shot dead with 115 injured.\n\nAs portrayed in the recent gritty Netflix hit drama “Snabba Cash,” the lives of Stockholm’s drug gangs are often brutal and short | Fredrik Person FREDRIK/TT News Agency/AFP via Getty Images\n\nStockholm, Sweden’s largest city, has seen the highest rates of gun deaths this year (21) followed by the southern region that surrounds Malmö (11), but there has been at least one gun death in each of the seven regions which make up the Nordic country.\n\nExperts note that Sweden stands out in Europe because shootings are on the rise, while they are generally stable or falling elsewhere.\n\nAs portrayed in the recent gritty Netflix hit drama “Snabba Cash,” the lives of Stockholm’s drug gangs are often brutal and short, and the ruthlessness of the violence they unleash has begun to erode Sweden’s long-held reputation as a safe country.\n\n“The new trend that we see now is that [criminals] are shooting to kill,” Manne Gerell, an associate professor of criminology at Malmö University, told national broadcaster SVT. “That is one of the reasons why this year looks set to be the worst ever.”\n\nKey election issue\n\nWith less than a week to go until a general election in Sweden, law and order has emerged as the top issue for voters, according to recent research by Gothenburg University.\n\nThe race looks set to be a tight one with parties supporting Social Democrat Magdalena Andersson to continue as premier marginally ahead of those supporting her main rival, the center-right Moderate Party leader Ulf Kristersson.\n\nOpposition leaders recently sought to make up the ground by visiting the playground in Årby to condemn the violence and claim that they would do a better job fighting it.\n\nModerate leader Kristersson said the violence was “horrible.”\n\n“We have to say ‘Here, but no further,’” Christian Democrat leader Ebba Busch said, local media reported.\n\nOpposition parties say the government has been soft on crime for too many years and allowed gangs to terrorize communities like Årby. Among other things, opposition lawmakers highlight the government’s long-running problems with its target to recruit 10,000 more police officers by 2024 compared with 2016.\n\nPosters all over Sweden show Kristersson and other opposition leaders under phrases like “Now we’ll get Sweden in order” and “Ready to fight crime.”\n\nPrime Minister Andersson met with her Social Democrat colleague and Eskilstuna Mayor Jimmy Jansson at the end of August before speaking to reporters outside the town hall. She expressed shock at a shooting so close to where children were playing, and also sought to highlight a toughening of punishments for gang members as outlined in the government’s recent 34-point plan to tackle organized crime.\n\nPosters all over Sweden show Kristersson and other opposition leaders under phrases like “Now we’ll get Sweden in order” and “Ready to fight crime” | Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP via Getty Images\n\nHowever, she acknowledged that more needed to be done to stop recruitment of younger members into gangs to replace older criminals being locked away for longer terms.\n\nBeyond policing, experts also point to underlying social problems in places like Årby, which create an environment where criminality can take hold.\n\nMichael Tärnfalk, a researcher of social work at Uppsala University, told Sweden’s main morning news show last week that high levels of immigration over recent years had led to increased segregation in some suburbs, which had left them socially and economically vulnerable.\n\nHe said parents in those areas, who didn’t speak Swedish or have strong links to the local community, could find themselves unable to track the progress of their children in schools or to notice if they were moving in criminal circles.\n\nThose children were at an increased risk of recruitment by local gangs whose members had made a lot of money through drug dealing and were highly visible to youngsters in the community driving expensive cars and wearing fancy clothes, he said.\n\nBjörn Larsson, a local lawmaker with the ruling Social Democrats in Eskilstuna, out campaigning for his party ahead of the September 11 election, said the municipality had invested heavily in social services and programs that seek to stop youngsters from moving from less serious to more serious crimes.\n\nBut Larsson said there also needs to be a broad change in attitude across society, from the middle-class drug user who realizes that it is their money funding the gangs to the teenager reached by a teacher or social worker who sees a future outside criminality.\n\nA community center and library are already running in Årby offering, among other things, child care and support with job hunting, but Larsson said there “would be no easy fixes.” He said changing the outlook for young people in places like Årby would take time.\n\nBut in the park nearby, the 33-year-old mother out with her son shook her head at the thought of a future in the suburb.\n\n“We have to move out of here,” she said. “This is no place to raise a child.”",
    "Chair of NATO Military Committee visits Sweden": "From 31 August to 1 September 2022, the Chair of the NATO Military Committee, Admiral Rob Bauer, visited Sweden at the invitation of its Supreme Commander, General Micael Bydén. The purpose of the visit was to discuss the cooperation between Sweden and NATO during the accession process and to gain more insights into Sweden’s military capabilities.\n\nThe Chair of the NATO Military Committee, Admiral Rob Bauer started his official visit by meeting the State Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Mr Robert Rydberg, and the State Secretary of Defence, Mr Jan-Olof Lind. The discussions focused on the current security environment and the respective plans implemented to safeguard Allied and national territory as well as ongoing contributions to shared security. Admiral Bauer added that “Sweden and Finland’s membership in NATO will enable closer Baltic and Nordic defence cooperation; strengthen the Alliance’s presence in the High North and boost transatlantic security”.\n\nAccompanied by General Bydén and the Deputy Chief Joint Operations, Major General Wikman, Admiral Bauer travelled to Northern Finland, where he was able to observe exercise Vigilant Knife. Upon arrival, the Admiral was greeted by General Timo Kivinen, the Finnish Chief of Defence. On just a few days’ notice, hundreds of Swedish troops journeyed to Northern Finland where they were placed under Finnish command and trained with Finnish and British troops. The goal was to sustain immediate readiness and capability for combined operating on demanding missions. All troops showed that they are highly capable of working together under the conditions prevalent in Northern Finland. Admiral Bauer: “Never before have Sweden and Finland exercised together at such extremely short notice. What impressed me most is the vigour, passion, professionalism and effectiveness of their armed forces. NATO Allies are proud to have Finland and Sweden as their closest operational partners. And we hope to welcome them soon to our Alliance.”\n\nOn the second day, Admiral Bauer met the Commander of the Norrbotten Air Force Wing, Colonel Edström, who briefed him on ongoing air activities, including rapid response units and the monitoring and protection of Swedish airspace. “The Swedish Air Force has participated in NATO quick reaction alert exercises for over a decade. On a weekly basis, Swedish fighters fly defensive air drills with NATO fighters to contribute to the security and stability over Europe, the Baltic Sea Region and the High North”, highlighted the Admiral.\n\nAdmiral Bauer then discussed the accession process with the Head of the Swedish Armed Forces Headquarters Strategic Planning Group NATO, Major General Thomas Nilsson, and the Head of Policy and Plans Department, Major General Lena Persson Herlitz.\n\nIn a joint press conference with Swedish Chief of Defence, General Micael Bydén, Admiral Bauer addressed the ongoing accession protocol for Sweden to join NATO: “Sweden is one of NATO’s closest partners. We have been working together to strengthen our shared security, we share the same values and we have high interoperability. In parallel to the accession and ratification process, the preparations military integration process have also started. This means that Sweden is participating in meetings of the Military Committee as an invitee. We look forward to welcoming General Bydén at the Military Committee Conference in Tallinn on the 17th of September.”\n\n",

Furthermore, two COVID-19 vaccine doses provided substantial long-term protection against severe disease, according to follow-ups until 13 months after vaccination. The vaccine's effectiveness against hospitalization was high and stable prior to Omicron, but it also declined after Omicron.\n\nStudy: Effectiveness of COVID-19 Vaccines Over 13 Months Covering the Period of the Emergence of the Omicron Variant in the Swedish Population. Image Credit: Orpheus FX / Shutterstock\n\nBackground\n\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), affected millions of individuals globally and warranted rapid vaccine development and deployment after its outbreak. Hence, adequate clinical trials could not be conducted to determine the vaccine effectiveness (VE) against the rapidly evolving variants of SARS-CoV-2 and the newly developed and approved vaccines.\n\nThe study\n\nThis study aimed to estimate the time-dependent vaccine effectiveness (VE) against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the rate of hospitalization, admission to the intensive care units (ICUs), and fatality over 13 months after two doses of COVID-19 vaccination.\n\nThe study compared the time-dependent pattern of VE pre- and post-emergence of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, differences in the VE were noted based on gender, age, and vaccine type.\n\nThe study was conducted between December 2020 and January 2022 in Sweden among populations eligible for COVID-19 vaccination. In this country, vaccination of the elderly started on 27 December 2020; the younger population was vaccinated in 2021 and 2022, during which the campaign reached a larger part of the population. The cohort comprised individuals above 12 years of age. The Swedish register data were used for estimating COVID-19 VE with lapsing time and before and after the Omicron emergence – in reducing the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease outcomes.\n\nResults\n\nIn the cohort of 9,153,456 individuals, 85% were vaccinated with a single dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, 82% with two doses of vaccine, 45% with at least three doses of vaccine, and 15% were unvaccinated. The most vaccinated individuals (86%) were 65 or older. Most people received either mRNA-1273 (Moderna) or BNT162b2 BioNTech, Pfizer ) vaccine. A small percentage (8%) of the study population were vaccinated twice with the AZD1222 (Oxford, AstraZeneca) vaccine.\n\nOn average, the time gap between the first two doses was seven weeks (ten weeks for AZD1222), and between the second and third doses was 28 weeks (25 weeks for AZD1222).\n\nDuring the study period, 22% of the study population were infected with SARS-CoV-2 for the first time. There were 0.9% hospitalizations, while 0.1% required ICU admission. The fatality rate was 0.2%. The VE post second dose peaked after the third week, rapidly dropping between weeks 14-17. However, the VE seemed negligible from week 18.\n\nVE among hospitalized individuals peaked at 90% in the fifth and sixth week while maintaining up to 82% from week one to 25. Meanwhile, VE after the second dose was higher and lasted longer.\n\nAfter the first dose, the acquired immunity against COVID-19 was comparatively lower, the peak VE against COVID-19 infection was less than 50%, and the vaccine became ineffective from week 30. A transient decline in VE was documented after the first vaccination at week two, relative to week one, which peaked in the following weeks. However, the VE remained below 80%.\n\nThe Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 caused the speediest fall in VE. This led to a major disparity between the pre-and post-Omicron VEs. The VE mostly remained above 85% before Omicron emergence; however, it rapidly decreased after an Omicron infection episode and remained low. Vaccinated individuals who received two doses of COVID-19 failed to remain protected against Omicron within 14 weeks after the second dose.\n\nSimilar disparities were recorded among the hospitalized groups, although the differences were minor compared to those among individuals who sustained Omicron infection. Pre-Omicron period VE against hospitalization was durable and stable – above 85%. The post-Omicron infection VE sustained at 80% until the 25th week and decreased with time. Yet, limited protection against hospitalization persisted throughout the study period.\n\nAge differences did not have much of an effect on the overall VE pattern. Of note, the VE against infection was relatively higher in individuals above 60. In addition, females expressed greater VE than males.\n\nFurthermore, mRNA vaccines had higher VE against infection compared to AZD1222. While VE against hospitalization was comparable with all the three vaccines––all of which had a higher initial VE––which decreased rapidly for AZD1222.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe gradual waning of COVID-19 VE with time warrants widespread acceptance of booster doses of the vaccines. Therefore, effective measures to encourage people for booster doses should be undertaken for enhanced population level protection against COVID-19.\n\n*Important notice\n\nPreprints with The Lancet publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information.",
    "‘People don’t want to hear about it’: how the pandemic shaped Sweden’s politics": "In the Stockholm neighbourhood of Tensta, the pandemic has left many feeling hopeless and disenfranchised, says Fatuma Mohamed.\n\nWhile much of Sweden – including politicians – appear to have forgotten all about Covid, the health communicator and longtime resident said that many in the area are still grappling with its impact.\n\nAlthough people had been advised by authorities to work from home, many in Tensta, with its high refugee population, had no choice but to go out because of the nature of their jobs.\n\n“They didn’t have any possibility to stay at home,” said Mohamed, sitting outside Tensta Konsthall, a contemporary arts centre, where people were arriving for a coffee meet-up.\n\nTwo and a half years after the introduction of the “Swedish strategy”– the Scandinavian country’s divergent pandemic response, which kept schools open and eschewed lockdowns – the results are mixed.\n\nMental health and children’s learning appear to have been less affected than they might have been, although 2.57m infections were recorded in the population of just over 10 million and in excess of 19,900 died, with stark inequality exposed in the process.\n\nIn comparison, Norway, with a little over half Sweden’s population, has had 1.46m cases and nearly 4,000 deaths; while Finland, also with just over half Sweden’s population, has had 1.27m cases and nearly 5,700 deaths.\n\nFatuma Mohamed in Tensta, Stockholm. Photograph: Miranda Bryant/The Observer\n\nAn independent commission into the handling of the pandemic, the findings of which were published earlier this year, found that while the choice of path for disease prevention and control was “fundamentally correct”, the measures “were too few and should have come sooner”. The government, it said, should have taken control of all aspects of crisis management from the start and had relied too heavily on its public health agency, Folkhälsomyndigheten.\n\nAnd yet, as Sweden prepares to go to the polls on 11 September, in the first election since these life or death decisions were made, it is almost as if Covid never happened. Left- and right-leaning party leaders, who are in a tight race, are focusing on crime, immigration and energy prices but not Covid.\n\nFor many, this has highlighted the gulf between the living conditions of Sweden’s different communities. In Tensta, some groups of up to 10 people live in two-room flats, said Mohamed, 43, who has three daughters,\n\n“But the ‘Swedish’,” she said, miming inverted commas with her hands, “they live, maybe two or three people in eight, seven or four rooms, maybe. So they had the opportunity to have social distance.\n\n“It is not just a health problem,” she added. “This is a political problem.” Services such as banks, dentists and job centres had vanished from the area, she claimed, and many people were unemployed, splitting society into “parallel communities”.\n\n“It’s not good to have different lives in the same country. We are all the same people, we are all Swedish citizens, so we should have the same opportunity.”\n\nExperiences of the pandemic have deepened distrust of government and social services, she said. Mohamed isn’t sure how this will affect people’s votes in the election, but the rightwing anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats have become the second biggest party in the polls after Magdalena Andersson’s incumbent Social Democrats. The left, centre and green parties are saying the right things, Mohamed said, but she will be watching to see whether their words are turned into action.\n\nJimmie Åkesson (third from right), Sweden Democrats leader, visiting Linköping in April after riots sparked by a far-right threat to burn the Qur’an. Photograph: Jeppe Gustafsson/Shutterstock\n\n“I don’t think the people who live in this area have any trust for any party because we don’t have a good life,” she said. “Definitely, they don’t like to vote Sweden Democrats but, for the other parties, interest is not high because they think it’s the same: ‘If I vote or not vote, the result will be the same.’ Most don’t have jobs, we live cramped, we don’t have the same opportunities.”\n\nAnother Tensta resident, Liban Warsame, whose 19-year-old son was murdered in December 2020, said most people in the area felt left out of Swedish society, and that the pandemic had had a huge impact on the community. “Many older people from Somalia died because of the pandemic. In the election, we’re going to vote and we’re going to take our responsibility,” he said.\n\nHealth experts say they are disappointed by the lack of attention the pandemic is receiving and fear that lessons will not be learned from the vulnerabilities it exposed in Swedish society, especially its impact on immigrants and the elderly. Göran Stiernstedt, a member of Sweden’s coronavirus commission and associate professor of infectious disease at Stockholm’s Karolinska Institute, said: “It really exposed that the risk for people born outside Europe was much greater than those born in Sweden.” The impact on the elderly was also severe, he added, including lack of medical care in nursing homes and staff left alone with no doctors.\n\nSign up to This is Europe Free weekly newsletter The most pivotal stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Nothing had been done to fix the issue, he felt, despite investigations. “You could expect that this would have been a great thing now in the election, but you don’t hear a single word about that.”\n\nThe fact that the Corona Commission’s report was published the day after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine did not help it gain momentum, but Stiernstedt believes there is also a psychological explanation for the silence on Covid’s impact. “People don’t want to hear about it. They want to live their normal life. And when you walk today, it’s like 2019, actually, and that’s natural. I think it’s related to human nature.”\n\nWhile Emma Frans, a researcher and epidemiologist at Karolinska Institute, is surprised by the silence around Covid in the election, she\n\nsaid: “People have had thoughts about how do we look at our elderly. And also maybe understanding how this type of health crisis affects people differently depending on who they are, their position in society and what means they have.”\n\nThe pandemic had also highlighted “outdated” perceptions of what a “traditional Swedish home” looked like, she said. “And there were problems with not getting information out to people who are not speaking or reading in Swedish.”\n\nThrough the public health agency, which was responsible for responding to the pandemic, politicians had had a “free pass” when it came to Covid deaths, said Frans. The government “hid” behind Anders Tegnell, Sweden’s former state epidemiologist, she added.\n\nAmineh Kakabaveh, an influential independent MP. Photograph: Getty\n\nAt the Stockholm HQ of Folkhälsomyndigheten, Karin Tegmark Wisell, who became its head last November, stands by most of the major decisions made during the pandemic – including keeping schools open and not making face masks mandatory. But, she said, Covid had highlighted ongoing health inequalities, especially among immigrants, more of whom ended up in intensive care.\n\nThese problems, she said, could not be solved by a public health agency alone and needed government intervention; she said she would like to see the matter addressed more in the election. “From my perspective, that is the most important issue,” she said.\n\nAmineh Kakabaveh, an independent politician who has played a pivotal role in the power balance of the current government, said parties weren’t criticising the pandemic response because they were part of the decision-making process. “Each of them had opportunity to say something, to do something – that is why it is passed, even if it is not over. But on class, society and employment, a lot of people still don’t feel good psychologically.”",

    "Right-wing nationalism comes to ... Sweden?": "As we look ahead to midterm elections, where election deniers are on the ballot in 27 states, it’s still mind-blowing to consider how we got here in just a few years. And the answer, most bluntly, is a rise in right-wing nationalism.\n\nAfter lying dormant for some time, the contours of this new and arguably ascendant movement are by now well-known. There are many characteristics, most of which are deeply troubling if you’re a fan of democracy, including but not limited to:\n\nA preference for national, religious and ethnic purity; an antipathy for migrants and immigrants; an open hostility to the press and a desire to punish critics; and an apologist or even approving approach to authoritarianism.\n\nWhile all of that easily describes the right-wing nationalism stoked and nurtured by Donald Trump here in America, it also describes a stunning surge of authoritarianism in other countries, most notably Brazil and Hungary, where leaders Jair Bolsonaro and Viktor Orban, respectively, have puppeted Trump’s strong-arm nationalism to considerable success.\n\nColumnists bug Columnists In-depth political coverage, sports analysis, entertainment reviews and cultural commentary.\n\n\n\nElsewhere, from Boris Johnson and now Liz Truss in the United Kingdom to Marine Le Pen in France, right-wing nationalism is getting a bigger audience, not a smaller one.\n\nThis is disturbing enough. Whether in Latin America or Europe, an embrace of nationalism, and in some cases fascism, recalls some truly horrific moments in world history.\n\nBut what if I told you right-wing nationalism was also winning in some less expected places — say, Sweden?\n\nYes, the same Sweden that American liberals and progressives have long called an egalitarian utopia.\n\nThe same Sweden that consistently ranks among the happiest, the freest, the most liberal, friendliest to immigrants, freest for journalists, the least racist and safest for LGBTQ travel countries in the world.\n\nLast week, this same Sweden held general elections to elect the 349 members of the Riksdag, or legislature. The right-wing Sweden Democrats won a net gain of 11 new seats, for a total of 73, surpassing the moderates to make it the second-most popular party in the country behind the left-wing Social Democrats.\n\nThis was shocking for many Swedes and election watchers, according to Elisabeth Asbrink, author of “Made in Sweden: 25 Ideas That Created a Country.” The success of the Sweden Democrats, she writes in The New York Times this week, “marks the end of Swedish exceptionalism, the idea that the country stood out both morally and materially.”\n\nOpinion Newsletter\n\nAs she describes it, the party’s origins date back to 1988 and a neo-Nazi group called BSS, or Keep Sweden Swedish. The far-right movement has “profited from the country’s growing inequalities, fostering an obsession with crime and an antipathy to migrants.”\n\nShe notes how the party’s chief of staff in the Swedish Parliament declared that critical journalists should be “punished” and were to be considered “enemies of the nation.”\n\nThe country’s defense minister called the party a security risk, due to its neo-Nazi ties.\n\nEarlier this year, the party’s leader, Jimmie Akesson, refused to choose between President Joe Biden and Russian dictator Vladimir Putin.\n\nThis all sounds very familiar to us: It echoes the climate we’ve been living in here in the U.S. for the past six years during the rise of Trump.\n\nIt was once easy to think of this new political populist era as a uniquely American response to uniquely American problems. Trump was, after all, a uniquely American invention, and he was both benefiting from and leaning into uniquely American divisions and grievances.\n\nBut clearly we aren’t as special as we thought. A rise in populism in India and Pakistan, as well as Poland, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, France and now even Sweden is proving the movement is global, and so is its appeal.\n\nTo call it merely nostalgia is to divorce it from the racial, ethnic and sexual anxieties that inform right-wing nationalism and make up many of its punitive policies. But a desire to return to some long-gone way of life is a common thread across international borders.\n\n“Back to red cottages and apple trees, to law and order, to women being women and men being men,” as Asbrink describes it in Sweden.\n\nThe reaction to this voting block sounds familiar, too: “Individuals leaning toward the Sweden Democrats … have felt stigmatized … This has not only fed the party’s self-image as a martyr but also nurtured even more loyalty among its supporters,” Asbrink writes.\n\nPerhaps it’s some consolation to know the U.S. isn’t the only democracy in jeopardy — that we aren’t uniquely susceptible to these dark impulses, that this isn’t one of those “only in America” problems.\n\nBut that doesn’t change the fact that none of this is good. The rise in right-wing nationalism is corrosive and chilling, and the more it spreads, the worse it is for the world.\n\nS.E. Cupp is the host of “S.E.

    "Sweden restricts international oil and gas finance to deliver on climate commitment": "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nContact:\n\nAdam McGibbon, adam.mcgibbon [at] priceofoil.org\n\nSweden restricts international oil and gas finance to deliver on climate commitment\n\nAt the COP26 United Nations Climate Conference in Glasgow, 39 countries and institutions signed up to the Glasgow Statement, committing themselves to ending “new direct public support for the international unabated fossil fuel energy sector by the end of 2022, except in limited and clearly defined circumstances that are consistent with a 1.5°C warming limit and the goals of the Paris Agreement.” The initiative has the potential to shift $39 billion a year out of fossil fuel projects and into clean energy if countries keep their promises.\n\nAs the deadline for implementing the Statement looms, the Swedish export credit agencies, SEK and EKN, have released an updated policy. A previously-released policy aligned Swedfund – the Swedish development finance institution – with the Glasgow Statement.\n\nSEK and EKN’s new policy ends almost all support to fossil fuels by 31st December 2022, with some limited exemptions:\n\nGas-fired power plants, new oil or gas extraction and oil refineries will still be supported if the project / company “has documented and realistic transition plans in line with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5-degree target, e.g. equipped with carbon capture and storage (CCS) or equivalent emissions reduction technologies” OR if “The transaction refers to substantial environmental or safety improvement measures while no expansion of the oil or gas operation.”\n\nUntil 31st December 2022, gas-fired power plants can be supported in “countries with large development needs or in countries where the exporter or buyer can show that the project is part of reconstruction after war or conflict.”\n\nEssentially, this means that the Swedish policy, although an improvement, does not rule out support for oil exploration and extraction as clearly as the best-practice UK and Denmark policies. However, in practice, if Sweden’s requirement for a 1.5°C transition plan is implemented with integrity and good faith, this should mean that no new guarantees can be issued for such projects. According to the International Energy Agency, to maintain a 50% chance of limiting global warming to 1.5°C, there can be no investments in new coal, oil or gas fields. Other research shows that on top of ending investments in new fossil fuel supply, 40% of already developed oil and gas reserves need to be left unextracted. A similar rationale applies to new gas-fired power plants: both the production and use of gas needs to be rapidly reduced to limit global heating to 1.5°C and the committed emissions from existing energy infrastructure (including power infrastructure) already jeopardize the 1.5°C target. The good news is that clean and affordable alternatives to gas-fired power exist and can better deliver on energy access needs. In 2020, the UN Sustainable Energy for All initiative recommended that “financing of fossil fuel projects as a means of closing the energy access gap should be terminated,” noting that they are no longer the most effective means of providing electricity access.\n\nWhether these projects will actually be ruled out depends on how EKN and SEK evaluate 1.5°C transition plans, which leaves some uncertainty in the Swedish position.\n\nIt is concerning that EKN is considering providing export finance support to CTT Mozambique, a project to build a gas-fired power plant in the east African nation. If EKN intends to act as a climate leader and listen to the science, this project cannot be supported.\n\nAmid all this, a hopeful sign is that EKN and SEK’s ‘Scientific Climate Council’ have made public statements that should provide the Swedish export credit agencies with ample reason to not exploit the loopholes in the policy. The advisory council noted that “the price today for coal, oil and gas makes new fossil-based investments hard to justify based on a strict financial calculation,” that “natural gas should not be seen as a transition fuel” and that “In most cases, it is not possible to justify new investments in fossil-based electricity and energy production. These are long investment cycles which result in lock-in effects, which in turn undermine the possibilities to reach the 1.5-degree target and also risks the investment becoming a “stranded asset”.\n\nAs a member of the Export Finance for Future (E3F) initiative, Sweden must use its diplomatic capital to ensure that all other E3F members implement the Glasgow Statement and present their updated policies at the upcoming E3F Summit. This way E3F members can build momentum towards COP27, ensure other Glasgow Statement signatories follow suit and meet their agreed end of 2022 deadline. [This leadership is vital to mitigating the climate crisis as of all public finance institutions ECAs are still the worst performers when it comes to Paris Alignment. The G20 ECAs provide 11 times as much export support to fossil fuel projects (USD 40.1 bn/yr) as for clean energy (USD 3.5 bn.yr)].\n\nAlthough E3F was designed to “harness public export finance as a key driver in the fight against climate change” and all members signed onto the Glasgow Statement, the coalition is not yet on track. The majority of its members have not yet updated their policies in line with the Glasgow Statement, and E3F itself has not yet made ending international public finance for fossil fuels a prerequisite for joining the initiative. Sweden must use its E3F membership to raise the bar, urging all other E3F members to implement the Glasgow Statement by the E3F Summit in order to build momentum to COP27, and make fossil-free ECAs policies a requirement for new members to join the initiative going forward.\n\n###",
    "Dagen H: the day Sweden switched to driving on the right – archive, 1967": "Halting way to the right road\n\n4 September 1967\n\nStockholm\n\nCheering crowds brought traffic to a halt here today as Sweden changed to driving on the right after four years of preparations, 40 years of argument, and at a total cost estimated at double the official figure of £40m.\n\nAll traffic had to halt for 10 minutes at 4.50 this morning throughout Sweden’s 60,000 miles of roads, but in Kungsgatan, Stockholm’s Oxford Street, the wait for impatient Swedish drivers wanting to try their luck on the right was much longer.\n\nBarred\n\nThough the centre of the city had been barred for nearly 24 hours to all but taxis, buses, and cars with special permits, a solid jam developed as sightseers, cyclists, and television cameramen swamped the roadway.\n\nThe police watched dourly as long lines of traffic – headlamps glaring, horns blowing –tried vainly to switch sides in the approved manner, getting hopelessly entangled in the process.\n\nWith military helicopters buzzing overhead, order was eventually restored and “Höger-dag”, “Right Day”, as the Swedes reverently term it, returned to the clockwork efficiency which marked its planning. Some 2,000 soldiers, 6,000 civil police, 50,000 school police, and 150,000 volunteers were on duty throughout Sweden, while an army of construction workers had worked throughout the night to make the final alterations to 350,000 street signs.\n\nLast detail\n\nThough there was the occasional jam and a number of minor accidents, the Swedish reputation for thoroughness can hardly ever have been better displayed. Typical of the meticulous attention to detail was that even the elk-hunting season had been brought forward a week so that hunters would not add to the traffic problem.\n\nTo prevent accidents from absent-mindedness after the change, and intensive publicity campaign has been mounted by the government in addition to the imposition of strict speed limits. These range from 40kph (25mph) in built-up areas to 90kph (58mph) on motorways. Drivers have been advised to keep their headlights switched on night and day until tomorrow.\n\nThe testing time, police say, is likely to be in about three weeks when drivers begin to relax and forget. The attitude here to the change seems curiously ambivalent. Many drivers say they are thankful it is at last over, yet are critical of the cost of the operation.\n\nThe criticism is no doubt the sharper because of the proposed 50 percent increase in vehicle tax next year, which is widely held to be the result of “Höger-dag.” And only just over 10 years ago in a national referendum, 83 percent voted against the change. When the Bill was finally passed in the Riksdag in 1963 after a deal between the two major political parties, it was estimated that the cost would be Kr400m (£28m) to be raised by a special vehicle tax of £2 13s for small cars and £5 for large cars, buses, and lorries.\n\nCost of £80m\n\nIn 1965 the official estimate was revived to Kr600m (£42m) and is now believed that the final cost to the government is likely to exceed Kr800m (£60m) with indirect cost of at least Kr200m, making a total of £80m.\n\nSign up to This is Europe Free weekly newsletter The most pivotal stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Iceland now plans to change next year.\n\nThough the British Road Federation, the Ministry of Transport, the AA and the RAC, all had observers in Stockholm, there is as yet no enthusiasm from anyone for a similar move in Britain.\n\nThe cost would be astronomical – £350m was the last estimate – but even more important, the reasons which led Sweden to conform with her neighbours are not applicable. Ninety per-cent of our cars are not left-hand drive and the number of foreign and British cars entering and leaving is still comparatively small.\n\nUntil the Channel tunnel is built and until we get into the Common Market, the idea of a change is almost certainly a non-starter. Even then our insularity in every sense could well delay the move for at least a generation. But by the year 2000 even the Swedes think we will have followed suit.",

But with prices set on international markets, it has not escaped the continent-wide effects of the war in Ukraine on energy prices.\n\n\"A rise of over 100% feels brutal in itself. But the cost may be three or four times as high,\" Lindman Marko said, adding that this winter she plans to lower the thermostat at home, wear thermal clothes and go to the sauna at a local swimming pool to warm up.\n\n\"Clearly the more worried you are over, for example electricity prices, the more it will affect how you vote,\" she said.\n\nPetrol and food prices have also soared. The cost of butter is up by around 25%, meat 24% and cheese around 22% this year, according to consumer price comparison site Matpriskollen.\n\nStockholm's Stadsmission, a non-profit organization, said it had seen its membership of its Matmissionen subsidized foodshops nearly double in the first half of the year.\n\n\"It's a broad group - maybe you are a pensioner, maybe you are unemployed or perhaps have not lived for a long time in Sweden,\" said Johan Rindevall, who heads up the Matmissionen shops.\n\n\"Forty percent of our new members this year have been families with children.\"\n\nMatmissionen sells food donated by major chains to members with monthly incomes below 11,200 crowns at around 30% of the prices seen in high-street shops.\n\nPROMISES, PROMISES\n\nThe two major political blocs are rushing out promises to help consumers fight the effects of inflation.\n\nPrime Minister Magdalena Andersson's Social Democrat government has promised up to 90 billion Swedish crowns ($8.36 billion) in subsidies to ease the pain of rising electricity bills for households and businesses, on top of billions in subsidies paid last winter. read more\n\nThe Moderates, the leading centre-right opposition party, have promised income tax cuts and lower fuel prices, which they say would mean 24,000 crowns extra for working families each year.\n\nThey intend to pay for measures by cutting back on overseas aid and benefits like unemployment and sickness insurance.\n\nAs a longer term solution to the energy crisis, the centre-right plans loan guarantees of up to 400 billion crowns to support building new nuclear power stations. Like Germany, Sweden has been shutting reactors in recent years.\n\nThe Left Party, loosely part of the centre-left bloc, wants to halt electricity exports.\n\nOpinion polls don't give a clear answer as to which policy promises have caught voters' eyes, but the ruling Social Democrats have at least avoided blame for the gloomy economic outlook.\n\nThe two main blocs are running neck-and-neck though the Social Democrats are easily the largest party. read more\n\nTOUGH CHOICES\n\nWhoever wins may find it hard to live up to all their promises.\n\nThe NIER, a government think-tank, reckons the next administration will have around 120 billion crowns to play with in terms of extra spending.\n\nA chunk of that is already earmarked for defence spending as Sweden raises its allocation to 2% of GDP from the current 1% to support its bid to join NATO, and for other measures like boosting healthcare and employing more police to deal with gang crime. read more\n\nAt the same time, GDP growth is expected to slow to around 0.4% next year, according to a government forecast, and even grind to a halt completely if inflation worsens and rates rise more than currently expected. read more\n\nIncreasing public debt would \"add fuel to inflation and further raise interest rates and could also threaten public finances, threaten welfare and pensions,\" Finance Minister Mikael Damberg warned last month.\n\nDiverting cash to support households will leave less for structural reforms needed to support the shift to a \"green\" economy, to rebuild the welfare state and to meet a skills shortage in the labour market.\n\nThe Social Democrats' plan to subsidize energy bills will be paid from a fund that is supposed to be used, in part, for expanding transmission capacity - one of the major causes of record domestic electricity prices in Sweden.\n\nPlans by the right to decrease the amount of biofuel in petrol and diesel, making them cheaper, will also make it harder to reach the country's target of zero net emissions by 2045.\n\nIt is also uncertain which policies will get approval from the next parliament, given that even within the centre-left and right blocs there is much disagreement about what to do and how to pay for it.\n\n\"No responsible politician can say that they will compensate for every price rise,\" Andersson said last month.\n\n($1 = 10.7646 Swedish crowns)\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nReporting by Simon Johnson Editing by Frances Kerry\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

    "A far-right party in Sweden has grown more influential in recent years": "A far-right party in Sweden has grown more influential in recent years\n\nNPR's Steve Inskeep talks to correspondent Charlie Duxbury of Politico Europe, about the rise of the Sweden Democrats, from a neo-Nazi group to an influential political party after Sunday's elections.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nA far-right party with roots in neo-Nazi groups is expected to play a central role in Sweden's next coalition government.\n\nA MARTINEZ, HOST:\n\nThe Sweden Democrats have grown more influential in recent years after it moderated some of its positions and expelled some of its extremist members. Its anti-immigration, tough on crime platform resonated with Swedish voters in Sunday's election.\n\nINSKEEP: Charlie Duxbury is the Stockholm correspondent for Politico Europe and joins us. Welcome.\n\nCHARLIE DUXBURY: Good morning.\n\nINSKEEP: I just heard A say they moderated their positions. What did they stand for in the past, and what do they stand for now?\n\nDUXBURY: Yes, so the Sweden Democrats do have roots in neo-Nazi groups of the late '80s, early '90s in Sweden. In the years since, they kind of cleaned things up and moved more towards the mainstream, but they still stand for a very hard line on immigration and a hard line on law and order. And that's what seems to have attracted voters in Sunday's vote.\n\nINSKEEP: Hasn't Sweden welcomed a relatively large number of refugees from the Middle East and elsewhere in recent years?\n\nDUXBURY: That's right. During Europe's migration crisis from 2015 onwards, Sweden took a relatively large number of those asylum-seekers. And the government at the time, social democratic government, was relatively welcoming in the same way that Germany was, and tens of thousands of asylum-seekers arrived in Sweden. Since then, there's been a kind of backlash in - among some groups, particularly the Sweden Democrats, who said that that was a mistake and that the integration of immigrants since then has been a failure.\n\nINSKEEP: Well, what does it mean that they did so well in Sunday's election? And how much influence do they now have? They wouldn't be leading the coalition, I guess.\n\nDUXBURY: No. So the count's still ongoing. We should have a final result by this evening. What is expected to happen is that the center-right moderate party will lead the government but will lean heavily on the Sweden Democrats, who achieved a score of about 20% of the vote on Sunday. And the Sweden Democrats will be under pressure from their own voters to show that they can deliver on some quite ambitious campaign pledges to cut down on immigration, to increase policing powers in sentencing in the courts in Sweden. So that will be a closely watched discussion over the days and weeks to come.\n\nINSKEEP: Is the center-right party that seems likely to lead the coalition in a position where they would essentially have to do what the Sweden Democrats demand on their particular issues to keep the coalition together?\n\nDUXBURY: They'll certainly have to offer some serious concessions to the Sweden Democrats to hold this loose coalition together. They may decide to offer them ministerial positions. They may decide to try and run a minority government with the Sweden Democrats outside. But either way, the Sweden Democrats are going to demand serious influence over the government in the four-year mandate period to come, and they will have to show the voters that they've achieved that.\n\nINSKEEP: Charlie Duxbury, correspondent for Politico Europe in Stockholm, thanks so much.\n\nDUXBURY: Thank you.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nCopyright © 2022 NPR.

    "From Isolationist Neutrality to Allied Solidarity: The Swedish Road to NATO Membership": "When the Swedish government under Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson submitted the Swedish application for NATO membership to NATO HQ in Brussels on May 18th, 2022, it was widely and correctly considered a historic event. But why did it happen? And why did it happen so seemingly fast? To understand this, both the peculiar history of Swedish security policy—or the “grand strategy”—and the recent developments must be taken into account.\n\nThe application has formally ended some 200 years of a very different grand strategy, which —under names such as “Sweden’s Neutrality Policy” or the “Swedish Non-Alignment”—had one overarching and explicitly isolationist goal. This was to save Sweden from the horrors of war, regardless of whether its neighbours were invaded, raped or occupied. This policy was introduced in the early 19th century by the then king-elect, Jean Baptiste Bernadotte, a former French Napoleonic marshal, and constituted, in its turn, a fundamental change of the earlier Swedish “grand strategy”. Since at least the early 17th century and until Finland was lost to Russia in 1809, Sweden had been an active geopolitical player in the European great power games—another 200-year period. The Russian conquest of Finland was a major blow not only militarily but also to the Swedish national identity. Finland had, after all, been a completely integrated part of Sweden for more than 600 years. Facing a new reality, Bernadotte focused on shaping a forced union with Norway in 1814 to solidify a new, smaller Swedish kingdom with borders easier to defend against Russia. Thereafter, no major changes in Swedish grand strategy took place until 1995, when Sweden joined a political, if not military, alliance—the European Union. During both world wars, and the ensuing Cold War, Sweden conducted a grand strategy based on the maxim “non-alignment in peace aiming at neutrality in war”. During most of the Cold War, however, Sweden pursued secret collaborative arrangements with NATO countries to counter a possible Soviet attack on Sweden.\n\nDuring the 1970s and ‘80s, the Swedish neutrality policy acquired a new and much more ideological meaning. A neutral stance in the dramatic last decades of the Cold War was seen as morally and ideologically superior to an allied stance. The Social Democratic prime minister Olof Palme became especially associated with this idea. It was based on a Swedish conception, popular at that time, according to which the two superpowers—the US and the Soviet Union —were seen as essentially similar kinds of evil. Standing outside either alliance was considered a better position from a both moral and geopolitical perspective. The isolationist character of the neutrality policy—hardly a morally superior one—was subsequently swept under the carpet. In this form, the neutrality policy became a central part of Swedish national identity. To be a Swede was to be non-aligned and neutral.\n\nIt was to be expected that applying for NATO membership after two centuries of neutrality would be met with surprise and shock by most Swedes. This is also how the development has been framed by some Swedish commentators: the decision was taken “in haste”; it was “not democratically decided upon”; the debate was “suppressed”, and the timeframe was “way too short”. And it is fair to say that expressions of surprise dominated the international reaction to the Swedish decision too.\n\nIn fact, the Swedish decision to apply for NATO membership was the apex of a long process that started more than 20 years ago. The first political party to switch to a pro-NATO stance, the Liberals (formerly the People’s Party, Folkpartiet), did so in 1999. The current leading opposition party, Moderaterna (centre-right), changed their position in favour of membership in 2003. The other centre-right parties—the Christian Democrats and the Centre Party (agrarians)—revised their policy in the same way in 2015. The right-wing populist party, the Sweden Democrats (Sverigedemokraterna), had long been an opponent of NATO membership but changed its mind on the desirability of an official “NATO option” in the Swedish security doctrine in 2020. The party eventually began promoting NATO membership as soon as it became obvious in early 2022 that Finland was going to apply. The parliamentary opposition to membership was thus reduced to the Green Party, the former Communist Party (the Left Party) and the party of the current minority government, the Social Democrats. Thus, already in early 2022, a solid parliamentary majority for NATO membership existed months before the Social Democratic government changed its mind.\n\nSimilarly, the Swedish public opinion regarding NATO membership has undergone major long-term changes. For about 20 years after the end of the Cold War, a very substantial majority in Sweden disapproved of NATO membership—until 2013, between 50% and 70% were against it. From 2013 up to 2022, about a third of the Swedish population was in favour of NATO membership; a third was against it, and a third was undecided. An April 2022 poll showed that 57% of the Swedish public was now entirely behind NATO membership, while only 22% were against it. Hence, the May 2022 decision to apply for membership was by no means taken against a wall of domestic discontent.\n\nThe Road towards Membership\n\nWhat made the Swedish government—i.e., the Social Democratic party—change its mind then? Well, the jury is still out, but it is fair to say that there were three crucial factors at play. The first one is of course the February 24, 2022—the Russian invasion and its war of aggression against Ukraine. This is also the official line of the Swedish government: the war constitutes such a dramatic challenge to the European security order that all earlier strategies and policies must be reconsidered, including Swedish non-alignment. But European security has seen many major challenges during the last 100 years alone: the world wars, the Cold War and the various Soviet invasions of neighbouring, even if allied, countries, such as Hungary and Czechoslovakia. And none of them made Sweden change its neutrality policy. Not changing this policy was also essentially the official line as spelled out by the Swedish prime in early March 2022. Later that month, however, she warmed up to the idea of joining NATO, and the government initiated an internal study group tasked with writing a report on the consequences of the Russian war against Ukraine. When the report was published in May, its conclusions would only go as far as indirectly recommending NATO membership as the most adequate answer to the Russian aggression.\n\nYet underlying all this was another factor, whose importance for the Swedish NATO application cannot be overstated—the strategy of the Finnish government. As early as in their official New Year’s Eve speeches in 2021, both President Sauli Niinistö and Prime Minister Sanna Marin all but indicated that NATO membership was on the Finnish agenda. The Finnish government also ordered a study group to analyse the pros and cons of NATO membership. The group’s report and conclusions were published in April and turned out to be strongly focused on the pro-membership arguments. In this context, Prime Minister Marin travelled to Stockholm and held meetings with her Swedish counterpart while noting that Finland’s decision on whether to apply for membership would be taken shortly. It was obvious—if not explicitly spelled out—that Helsinki now was on the path toward membership. Given the extremely close political and military cooperation that Sweden enjoys with Finland, as well as the countries’ common history and geostrategic dependency on each other, it became increasingly clear that a Finnish membership would almost automatically lead to a Swedish one. To be outside the alliance in the event of a Finnish membership would—most Swedish analysts, military officers and most Social Democrat officials agreed—be completely untenable for political, geostrategic and purely military reasons.\n\nThere is the third factor of utmost importance underlying the Swedish decision, although it is seldom spelled out. This factor can be called the “defence deficit”. All the way through the Cold War, Sweden backed its security policy—i.e., the neutrality policy—with a very substantial defence posture. As late as the 1980s, Sweden had a mobilizable defence force of some 800,000 troops, including 30 army brigades, more than 300 modern, domestically built fighter planes, a navy of about 55 surface combatants and 12 submarines, a strong coastal artillery system and a 100,000 men strong national guard-type organization (“Hemvärnet”). 800,000 troops are actually more than half of the current US active-duty force. The US is a country more than 30 times bigger than Sweden in terms of population and enjoying what is an unmatched defence budget and posture in the entire world.\n\nThis would not be an exaggeration to say that, up to the end of the Cold War, Sweden took its armed neutrality posture very seriously, spending around 3% of its GDP on defence for decades. It changed fundamentally, though, after the end of the Cold War: the armed forces were cut about 90%. Today, Sweden can barely muster 50,000 troops, including only one (1) full army brigade (although working on building two more). Its air force consists, in practice, of less than 70 fighter planes and there are at most seven surface combatants and three submarines active in the navy on any given day. It goes without saying that such a force is not able to withstand a Russian attack on its own. General Sverker Göranson, the then Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, said in 2013 that, in the event of a military attack, Sweden would only be able to defend one limited part of the country—such as the Stockholm area—for about a week. That revelation was a major reason for the change in Swedish public opinion on NATO membership that year.\n\nThese three factors go a long way in terms of explaining the Swedish membership application in May 2022. Given that the issue of non-alignment is part of the national identity, one would have expected major upheavals in substantial parts of Swedish public opinion. However, it has never materialized. The Social Democratic party—the real bulwark of the neutrality policy for decades—organized a top-down internal process about the issues involved, after which the internal opposition to the membership application fizzled out entirely. No major protest demonstrations have been held—the few ones that did take place attracted less than 800 people each. Even with a couple of critical articles in the left-leaning elite mass media outlets, the opposition to the application has been remarkably muted. In contrast, the enthusiasm for NATO membership within the armed forces, the professional staff of the ministries of defence and foreign affairs, analysts and academics, as well as large parts of the public, is most tangible.\n\nThe Consequences\n\nHowever, the Swedish NATO membership is not a done deal yet due to Turkey’s concerns about Swedish—and to a lesser extent Finnish—relations with various Kurdish organizations and individuals. Therefore, it is a bit premature to consider all the consequences of it. However, given Turkey’s eventual acceptance, the spectrum of geopolitical and military change in the Baltic Sea and Arctic regions will be huge. The Baltic Sea will become a NATO Lake—the environment that is similar to the mid-17th century when the kingdom of Sweden controlled most of the Baltic shores. Working together with allies or partners to deter or counter Russian aggression in this region is, after all, something Sweden has been doing—albeit sometimes only very discreetly—for more than 300 years. In that sense, Sweden’s NATO membership is not surprising at all.\n\nThis article was written for ICDS Diplomaatia magazine.

    "HPV self-sampling in Sweden leading to faster elimination of cervical cancer": "“With the new measures against human papillomavirus (HPV), we predict that cervical cancer elimination in Sweden could happen 5 years from now. If the pandemic had not occurred, it would have been much, much slower.”\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Joakim Dillner is a cancer specialist at the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden. He explains how the country was forced to rethink its approach to cervical cancer screening when non-emergency health care stopped in the capital region in April 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For 3 months, no one could access cervical cancer screening; then, when the national programme restarted, social distancing requirements meant clinics were unable to provide clinician-led sampling.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo solve the problem, HPV self-sampling kits were sent to all eligible women in the country, including those between 23 and 29 years of age who had previously been offered cytology-based screening (commonly called a Pap smear), which is conducted by a clinician.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Stockholm region, where 330 000 self-sampling kits were sent out, saw a dramatic 10% increase in population test coverage – from 75% to 85% – in just 1 year.\n\nHigh coverage, low cost\n\nEven as more women were being screened, results showed that HPV self-sampling picked up fewer HPV infections in those aged 23 to 29, as more of these women had been vaccinated against HPV in school. Previously, this age group had only been offered cytology-based sampling, which is less sensitive and less liable to result in overtreatment. The Swedish Government now includes this group in the national HPV screening programme.\n\n\n\n\n\n“The self-sampling kit is not highly specialized. It's basically the same thing as a mascara brush that a woman might use for her eyelashes,” says Professor Dillner. “These are very simple, low-cost sampling kits that are part of the HPV screening test.”\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Dillner is also keen to stress that the low cost of the kits could be a crucial factor in rolling out HPV self-sampling on a global scale, as not all countries can bear large expenses. Even considering the cost of laboratory analysis, he says, self-sampling represents a big saving for health services compared to the time costs involved in having a clinician carry out a test.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, WHO Senior Technical Officer Dr Marilys Corbex explains that HPV self-sampling may meet resistance in many countries where cervical cancer screening is carried out by general practitioners trained in gynaecology, who use it as the basis of their income.\n\nAdditionally, Dr Corbex says it is important that women do not self-sample whenever they like, because some will do it too often and others too rarely. She says it must be done within the target population and as part of an organized screening programme to be effective and to ensure that every woman is tested at the right time.\n\nAccording to WHO recommendations, the target population for screening is women 30 years and older, and women 25 years and older who are living with HIV.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Every sample needs to be analysed and that involves a cost,” points out Dr Corbex. “Also, if the result is positive, there needs to be adequate diagnosis and treatment follow-up in place for the woman, as part of an organized system.”\n\nCrisis and innovation\n\n“In Sweden, it would probably never have happened unless we had been forced to change. We would have continued to employ a lot of physicians and nurses to take these samples when it was actually not necessary. We even achieved a much higher population coverage by just giving it to the women directly. So that's something worth thinking about,” Professor Dillner points out.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to reducing the cost burden, he insists that a change in mindset could help to overcome barriers in rolling out HPV self-sampling elsewhere in the world. As part of a national organized screening programme, for example, women do not necessarily have to have a physical address or a mailbox in order to benefit from HPV self-sampling.\n\n\n\n\n\n“You can show up with a bucket full of self-sampling kits and distribute them in a marketplace or village in the morning, and then wait for them to be returned later that day,” Professor Dillner suggests. He adds, “It’s really quite easy, especially since many low- and middle-income countries have very advanced methods for electronic identification.”\n\nA change in mindset\n\nIn July 2022 new government regulations will come into effect in Sweden which allow women to choose whether they want to use a self-sampling kit or be seen by a clinician. This will free up resources so that women coming for their first screening test can also be vaccinated at the same time, and follow-up efforts can be concentrated on those women testing positive for cancer-causing HPV infection.\n\n\n\n\n\n“It was a mindset change that was needed,” says Professor Dillner. “When everything stopped, we had to think of something completely different. The expectation is that many women will be prevented from developing cervical cancer, and that we will progress faster on the path to reaching the WHO target of elimination of cervical cancer.”\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Dillner concludes, “A lot of things are possible when you realize you don’t need to think in the way you always have. It’s important to look at solving issues that come up in an alternative way. I think self-sampling is a huge game changer.”\n\n",

    "How Sweden goes about innovating": "Sweden’s attitude towards innovation is perhaps best exemplified by the Swedish innovation agency, Vinnova, a government agency founded in 2001 based on a series of predecessors going back to at least 1968.\n\nThe innovation agency functions much like its counterparts in other countries, similarly to the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation (Tekes) in neighbouring Finland, and to the part of the US National Science Foundation (NSF) that does seed funding on the other side of the Atlantic.\n\nThe Swedish government gives Vinnova more than €300m each year to invest through grants to different kinds of actors, which might be small companies, research institutes, large competence centres, or consortia of companies working together on projects.\n\nVinnova invests this money along 10 different themes, including sustainable industry and digital transformation. To report on the social and economic effects of its funding, the agency produces two impact studies annually. It has also published a document that describes its approach to tracking the impact of investments.\n\nSuccess stories in innovation “It’s never the case that we’re alone in the responsibility for success or failure,” says Göran Marklund, head of strategic intelligence and deputy director-general at Vinnova. “We usually fund collaborative projects in which we require the actors to contribute 50%, or more for large companies. This ensures they have a stake in the project – and that they will do what they need to be successful. There are often other outside investors.” Vinnova runs several projects in collaboration with the Swedish Energy Agency. This includes supporting a battery revolution currently underway in the north of Sweden – a project that revolves around Northvolt, a company whose founder, Peter Carlsson, was formerly an executive at Tesla. Now Carlsson is pushing Northvolt in directions that are revolutionising battery technology for many industries. For example, its batteries play an important role in transforming vehicles to electric – and automotive is a key industry in Sweden. Vinnova is also involved in artificial intelligence (AI), having written a report on the topic, and having helped start AI Sweden, an umbrella initiative that promotes the adoption of AI in the country. Vinnova looks for opportunities to promote the use of AI within businesses and public service agencies and to increase AI skills in Sweden. Another area where Vinnova has invested is quantum computing. Among other things, the agency ran a kick-start programme in 2021 to support projects that lead to commercialisation of quantum technology. “The global race is between China and the US, and with the EU [European Union] as a whole, particularly France and Germany,” says Marklund. “Though there is good applied research in quantum computing in Sweden, it is a challenge for such a small country to keep up with the rest of the world.” One area where Sweden has excelled for decades is in telecommunications – a key industry for Sweden, with Ericsson standing out as one of the world’s leaders. In an impact study published in 2008 called Effects of research on Swedish mobile telephone developments: The GSM story, Vinnova analysed the connection between research funded by Vinnova’s predecessors (Stu and Nutek) and the transformation of the Swedish telecommunications industry. The Ericsson group was the big winner from the transformation, and the company took an early lead in the global GSM market. According to some estimates, Ericsson had a five-year advantage compared with competitors. While it is hard to measure how important any single contributor was to this success, strategic funding was certainly crucial, especially for innovation in digital radio technologies.\n\nSweden is taking part in the digital transformation of mining Another big industry in Sweden is mining – and a major effort is underway to make mining fully sustainable. With help from Ericsson, ABB and Volvo, Swedish mine operator Boliden set up a test mine in Kankberg (pictured above) that will be completely automated as part of a pilot project overseen by Vinnova. The test mine began operations two-and-a-half years ago and will eventually operate autonomously, with no personnel in the mine itself. The project was kicked off in Sweden when Ericsson approached Vinnova with the aim of conducting digitisation projects. Vinnova suggested two pilots. The first was automation of manufacturing in Gothenburg; the second was the Kankberg mine in the county of Västerbotten that was part of a European effort to make mining more sustainable. Ericsson installed a 5G network throughout the Kankberg mine in early 2016, covering a path down to the mine area. Even with blind alleys and caves without line of sight to the antenna, Ericsson managed to provide high bandwidth (100mbps) and low latency throughout the mine. The network also met stringent requirements for reliability – very important requirements, since a loss of signal, even for a few seconds, could cause big problems. This ongoing demonstration project fits into the EU Commission programme Next Generation Carbon Neutral Pilots for Smart Innovation Mining Systems (or NexGen SIMS). One of the interesting aspects of the project is that it requires innovation in different industries – mining, telecommunications and machinery – which is beneficial to Sweden overall.\n\nSocietal challenges drive investment “Sweden does not have clearly defined national strategies for digital technologies that we can follow,” says Marklund. “But everybody knows what the hot topics are. Rather than try to find an entirely new topic that most of the people in the world haven’t yet thought of, what’s important is execution – how you make it happen on the ground.” “Having says that, Vinnova is definitely aligned with where many of the investments are going, internationally and nationally. We’re all over the board. We’re in IT and digital technologies, as in health, biotech and all kinds of technologies.” Vinnova is also the Swedish hub for the EU framework programme Horizon Europe. In this capacity, it facilitates the participation of Swedish actors in that EU framework programme, the biggest research and development programme in the world, with clearly specified areas for investment. Digital mining is an example of how Vinnova helps fund Swedish projects that fit into EU strategies. “Technologies alone do not lead. We also consider the market around the innovation” Göran Marklund, Vinnova “Our approach at Vinnova is more than just technological,” Marklund tells Computer Weekly. “We start by spotting societal challenges. This is what will drive competitiveness in the future. If you’re good at driving solutions to societal challenges, then you’re probably going to be very competitive, because those markets will grow.” Once a societal challenge is identified, the next step is to think about what it would take to overcome the challenge. The solution may have a technological component, but that has to be designed to work in specific contexts, like sustainable cities, which is one of the 10 themes where Vinnova invests. Sustainable industry is another – industry needs to transform into more sustainable solutions, to protect the environment of course, but also because the market demands sustainability. “If you’re not transforming your whole business, then you will probably be out of the market somewhere down the line,” explains Marklund. “We try to put technology in a wider, systemic context. For example, we look at technology as something that enables a transformation that brings about competitive sustainability.” As much as possible, the philosophy is to invest in technology that meets the needs of society. Vinnova looks at how AI can be employed in the context of social change, and how 5G signalling can be propagated deep underneath the surface of the earth to help automate mining, which will result in sustainable mining. In the case of battery technology, putting the technology into a wider context means answering a series of questions. How do you get the batteries working with the efficiency you need? Then you have questions about how much energy is required, and whether that energy is green. If it’s not green, the solution can’t be sustainable, so the market value of the innovation in question would be very low. The line of questions also leads to the materials needed for the batteries and where they can be obtained. It turns out that the materials currently used for batteries are scarce, and China dominates the market. This leads to questions about what alternative Sweden has for getting those materials. The minerals do exist in Sweden (and elsewhere in Europe) but have been in abundance and cheap in China for so long that these businesses never developed in Sweden. “Sweden has to develop these resources now because it cannot be dependent on China for such critical things,” says Marklund. “Then that becomes a very critical focus and identifies a set of technologies that are needed.” “This is how we go about finding places to invest. Technologies alone do not lead. We also consider the market around the innovation.”\n\nSwedish national advantages The areas of investment also tend to cluster around a country’s national advantages – what a country is already good at, or where industry is already developed. One of Sweden’s national advantages is the existing automotive industry, which is denser in Sweden than in Germany – that is, the amount of revenue generated per person is higher. This includes cars and trucks. By applying technology to overcome the challenges within the country, Sweden sometimes gets so good at it that it becomes a net exporter of certain solutions While the Chinese holding company Geely now owns both Volvo and Polestar, most of the work still takes place in Sweden, using Swedish workers. Automotive also has a big impact on many other sectors that generate solutions for the automotive industry. Another national advantage is the telecommunications industry, with Ericsson standing out internationally and very much linked to digital transformation. Mining and steel are also important industries and are dominant across Europe in certain parts of these industries. Another big industry is forestry. All those industries have given rise to a strong machinery industry. Sweden also has a very advanced research community, with pure and applied research in a several areas including artificial intelligence, quantum computing and the internet of things (IoT). Sweden’s education system is also very good, with a new focus on lifelong learning. Digitisation makes things change more rapidly, so skills have to be developed in the labour force more rapidly than before. Furthermore, an increasing number of jobs require digital skills."
