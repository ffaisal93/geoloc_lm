    "Shadow minister‚Äôs border poll remarks alarm Northern Ireland‚Äôs unionists": "Northern Ireland unionists have expressed alarm after the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Kyle, said he would be prepared to call a referendum on Irish unity if certain conditions were met.\n\nKyle would set out the criteria for calling a border poll if Labour were in power, he told the BBC‚Äôs Sunday Politics show at his party‚Äôs conference.\n\n‚ÄúIf the circumstances emerge as set out in the Good Friday agreement, I as secretary of state, would not play games. I would call the border poll,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI am saying I am not going to be a barrier if the circumstances emerge.‚Äù\n\nUnder the 1998 agreement, a secretary of state must call a referendum if it appears likely a majority of those voting would want the region to leave the UK ‚Äì but the agreement does not specify the criteria, a vagueness that the UK government and unionists have been keen to maintain.\n\nThe Irish government, Sinn F√©in and the Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP) have pushed for clarity on the criteria, which would lay out the steps needed for a vote that could abolish the state of Northern Ireland and unify the island.\n\nKyle said Sinn F√©in‚Äôs emergence as the biggest party in Northern Ireland and last week‚Äôs census results, which showed Catholics outnumbering Protestants, did not suffice. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not even in that circumstance yet, so when we move towards the point where those circumstances set out in the Good Friday agreement start to emerge and it becomes a priority for the people of Northern Ireland, I will act,‚Äù he said.\n\nOn Monday the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) leader, Doug Beattie, criticised the comments as an ‚Äúunhelpful and ill-timed‚Äù distraction from the cost of living crisis and other problems facing Northern Ireland.\n\nThe pro-union Belfast News Letter newspaper said the Labour politician had muddied the waters on a border poll and that it was essential any UK government kept wide discretion. It said: ‚ÄúIt is unfortunate that Mr Kyle has chosen this time to give succour to those who want to shatter the UK.‚Äù\n\nThe Sinn F√©in MP Chris Hazzard welcomed Kyle‚Äôs comments as recognition that the current position was ‚Äúunsustainable‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs having your head in the sand simply to deny the fact that constitutional change is coming, that people are talking about this, civic society and political parties and all around us,‚Äù the South Down MP said.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

    "Conor McMenamin: Northern Ireland winger cleared over historical video in which he appeared to sing a pro-IRA slogan": "Conor McMenamin has been cleared to play in Northern Ireland's Nations League match against Greece on Tuesday as he will face no further action regarding a historical video in which he appeared to sing a pro-IRA slogan.\n\nThe 27-year-old Glentoran winger was withdrawn from Ian Baraclough's squad shortly before Saturday's 2-1 win over Kosovo after the video emerged.\n\nHowever, given that the footage is believed to be almost a decade old and the former Cliftonville and Linfield player was punished by his club at the time, the Irish FA allowed him to travel to Athens on Sunday while an independent disciplinary committee considered whether he had breached IFA rules.\n\nMcMenamin has now been cleared and joined his team-mates in training on Monday evening ahead of the crunch fixture against Greece, in which Northern Ireland need to avoid defeat to be sure of not dropping into a relegation play-off.\n\nMcMenamin was withdrawn a day after striker Kyle Lafferty was sent home amid an investigation by his club Kilmarnock into a video appearing to show him using alleged sectarian language, but that was understood to have been recorded only last week.\n\nImage: McMenamin (right) has played three times for Northern Ireland\n\nMcMenamin's reinstatement for the Greece game will give him the opportunity to add to the three caps he earned in June after an outstanding season with Glentoran last term was rewarded with his first international call-up.\n\nSpeaking after Saturday's 2-1 win over Kosovo, Northern Ireland manager Baraclough had said he hoped historic videos would not become a recurring problem for the team.\n\n\"It's a distraction you'd rather not have,\" Baraclough said. \"To happen so close to kick-off time, I thought we did the right things in pulling Conor out of the squad. It needs to be looked at.\n\n\"Clearly it's a historic video from social media from when he was 16 I think. I'm not sure where it's going to go at this time.\n\n\"You just hope that it isn't (something that continues) and things don't get churned up. I'd rather leave it at that and not elaborate on it too much. I was trying to concentrate on a game of football and that's what we did.\n\n\"It's been tough for the boys because if you lose two members of the squad, you know they get close and they don't like to see that happen to anyone. It could have played a major factor but they rallied and got a result.\"\n\nAhead of Tuesday's match against Greece, Baraclough said on Monday it had been the right decision to keep McMenamin out of the Kosovo game, but that he was delighted to have him available again.\n\n\"I don't think we could take any chances as an association in light of what had happened a couple of days previously with Kyle (Lafferty),\" he said. \"The decision was taken, we see where it went, the disciplinary committee looked at that and now he is free to be with us tomorrow night which is good news.\n\n\"We couldn't be sure until we looked into it and that's what's been done. I think that was right. It was hard telling the lad, hard to give him the information and to deny him being with the squad and possibly making another cap but it was the right thing to be done.\"\n\nImage: Kyle Lafferty was sent home from Northern Ireland duty amid an investigation by his club Kilmarnock into a video appearing to show him using alleged sectarian language\n\nLafferty was sent home from the squad on Friday after a video emerged of him appearing to use an alleged sectarian slur in an altercation with fans, sparking an investigation from his club Kilmarnock. The 35-year-old remains absent with that investigation ongoing.\n\nBaraclough confirmed the incident was believed to have happened after he had taken the players out for dinner last Tuesday evening as part of a team-bonding exercise, but said he had no regrets about doing so.\n\n\"We all went out, we all went to the restaurant and we all came back,\" he said. \"The players had a day off the next day, they're adults and they know they've got a responsibility. When they're away on international duty they're representing themselves, their clubs, their families and me.\n\n\"We can't keep them cooped up in a hotel, we've got to give them a certain amount of trust and hope that's the right thing to do.\n\n\"It might be something we have to look at but it's always served Northern Ireland teams well when we've had that time together. It was something we weren't expecting, to wake up to those sorts of headlines and that sort of news. It was disappointing.\"",

U.S. President Joe Biden has warned against disrupting peace in Northern Ireland, and the two leaders discussed the issue at their first in-person meeting Wednesday.\n\n\"What's important is that we protect and respect the positions of both the nationalist community in Northern Ireland as well as the unionist community in Northern Ireland,\" Truss said Sunday.\n\nTruss is also facing rising tensions from Commonwealth nations around the globe following the death of Queen Elizabeth II, which has reignited debates over whether the nations should sever ties with the British monarchy.\n\nTruss said she has seen an \"outpouring of love and affection\" for the late Queen, and she is very supportive of the Commonwealth.\n\n\"I think the Commonwealth is a force for good,\" she said. \"It's a believer in freedom and democracy, and we need more of that in a world where we are facing these authoritarian regimes who want to subvert those ideas.\"",
    "Shifting demographics stirs debate on Northern Ireland‚Äôs future": "New census figures show that Catholics outnumber Protestants in Northern Ireland for the first time ever.\n\nFor the first time in Northern Ireland‚Äôs history, new census figures show that Catholics outnumber Protestants.\n\nThe results have been described as ‚Äúa seminal moment‚Äù by leaders of Irish republican parties ‚Äì who favour the reunification of Ireland and draw most of their votes from the Catholic population, and have caused disquiet in unionist camps ‚Äì who want to remain in the United Kingdom and are supported mostly by Protestants.\n\nWhile most of the island of Ireland gained independence from the UK a century ago, Northern Ireland was carved out in a way which explicitly aimed to maintain a permanent majority of pro-British Protestants.\n\nFor some, the new figures are thus another sign on the pathway to a united Ireland.\n\nJohn Finucane, a prominent member of the leading republican party Sinn Fein, called for preparations for the ‚Äúpossibility of a unity referendum‚Äù.\n\n‚ÄúThe partition of Ireland has been a failure. We can build a better future together, for every person who lives on this island,‚Äù the MP said upon the announcement of the results.\n\nComplex picture\n\nHowever, caution is required when interpreting the results and their political applications, Peter McLoughlin, a senior lecturer in political history at Queens University Belfast, told Al Jazeera.\n\nPeople from a Catholic background are not a majority of the total population, and nor do they all necessarily support a united Ireland.\n\n‚ÄúWhile we can say there is a very strong link between religion and political orientation, there are exceptions to the rule on both sides,‚Äù McLoughlin said.\n\nNonetheless, Northern Ireland‚Äôs history means that the fact that Catholics are now the larger group is clearly ‚Äúsymbolically and historically important‚Äù and will add to unrest among unionist political parties who have seen their position change in years.\n\nIn 2017, unionist parties lost their majority for the first time in the local legislature.\n\nEarlier this year, Sinn Fein gained the largest number of seats in the May elections, the first time a republican party has managed to do so.\n\nAnother worrying trend for unionists is that the number of people who defined their identity as ‚ÄúBritish only‚Äù dropped by 8 percent since the last poll in 2011.\n\nIt was noticeable that both main unionist parties briefed the media to downplay the significance of the results before they were even announced.\n\nWhat is clear is that unionists ‚Äì or indeed, Irish republicans ‚Äì will need to reach beyond those who identify as Catholic or British, Irish or British, in order to have enough support for their cause.\n\nMiddle ground\n\nAbout one in five people identify as ‚ÄúNorthern Irish‚Äù and may well support parties like Alliance, who do not take a stance on reunification and made significant gains in elections this May.\n\nKellie Armstrong, a representative of the Alliance party in the local legislature, told Al Jazeera that the census figures demonstrate that many people like her do not want to be ‚Äúpigeonholed‚Äù as British or Irish.\n\n‚ÄúIt just shows that we‚Äôre no longer a place of two parts, that we are actually a more pluralist and a much more diverse Northern Ireland,‚Äù she said.\n\nAny referendum on Irish unity ‚Äúwill be a lot more nuanced and it will be people like myself, people who are Northern Irish, the people who have not defined themselves by religious terms, that will actually decide whether there should be a border poll [referendum], and what that border poll like outcome will be‚Äù, Armstrong said.\n\nGrowing diversity\n\nThe census also shows the small but growing part of the population who are from Black or minority ethnic backgrounds or have migrated to Northern Ireland from the EU and elsewhere.\n\nThose from a minority ethnic background now make up 3.6 percent of the population ‚Äì four times what it was in 2001 at the end of the 30-year armed conflict, and more than 100,000 people recorded their place of birth as outside of Northern Ireland.\n\nWhile most people speak English, more people now speak Polish or Lithuanian than the indigenous languages, Irish or Ulster Scots.\n\nHowever, a parliamentary inquiry from earlier this year found that politics is not keeping pace with this change, stating that ‚Äúminority communities have often been overlooked in Northern Ireland‚Äù.\n\nThe report found that a perceived priority given to issues facing the main Catholic and Protestant communities means that this can ‚Äúsqueeze out‚Äù attention for minority ethnic and migrant communities, often seen as ‚Äúother‚Äù.\n\nNorthern Ireland also grapples with disproportionately high levels of hate crime ‚Äì where perpetrators are rarely brought to court.\n\nHate crime\n\nThe Belfast Multi-Cultural Association (BMCA) was fire-bombed in a hate crime attack in May, the day before they were due to reopen after a previous fire-bomb attack in 2021.\n\n‚ÄúVery often Black and ethnic minority communities are often left out of conversations‚Äù, said Coumilah Manjoo of the BCMA.\n\n‚ÄúThe census data is significant, it shows that the population is now more diverse than ever, the languages we speak is more diverse.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúEven with the census data, people seem to be far more interested with the ‚Äògreen and orange‚Äô [Catholic and Protestant] side of things. We have to move beyond that rhetoric.‚Äù",

    "Scotland 2-1 Republic of Ireland: Ryan Christie's late penalty gives hosts crucial win": "Last updated on .From the section Football\n\nRyan Christie scoring his late penalty for Scotland\n\nScotland need a point away to Ukraine on Tuesday to win Nations League Group B1 after a dogged comeback victory over the Republic of Ireland at Hampden.\n\nJohn Egan volleyed Ireland ahead early on, but Jack Hendry's header levelled.\n\nBoth sides spurned big chances before Alan Browne was penalised for handball and Ryan Christie stroked home the penalty winner eight minutes from time.\n\nThat puts Steve Clarke's side two points clear of Ukraine, who briefly went top with a 5-0 win in Armenia.\n\nHowever, Scotland head into their final group game in Krakow, Poland, with more injury worries after full-backs Kieran Tierney and Aaron Hickey were both forced off, while a late yellow card for Scott McTominay rules the midfielder out through suspension.\n\nIreland, meanwhile, can now finish no higher than third in the group.\n\nScotland were buoyed by Wednesday's 3-0 win over Ukraine at Hampden. But with that dominant performance came expectation they would simply roll over an Irish side who three months earlier had handed them a chastening 3-0 defeat.\n\nAnd a loud and confident Hampden was silenced when Troy Parrott slalomed through the Scotland defence and hammered the ball high into the net. The assistant referee's flag cut short the celebrations, but Ireland were again threatening to spring a shock.\n\nSoon the visitors broke on the counter-attack and got two v two. Hendry blocked Parrott's effort, but it only delayed the opener.\n\nSet-plays had been Scotland's downfall in Dublin and the frailty resurfaced. They struggled to clear a corner, the ball fell to Egan who lashed the ball through a ruck of bodies and past Craig Gordon.\n\nClarke's men had fallen apart in Dublin, but this time they responded strongly. The ball wouldn't fall for Stuart Armstrong and Lyndon Dykes in the box, while John McGinn mis-hit a shot wide, but the anticipation around Hampden was rising as the home side continued to pour forward.\n\nAnd four minutes into the second half Scotland were level. Matt Doherty allowed Christie to breeze past him all too easily, and Hendry met his delivery to guide a header into the far corner via the post.\n\nDoherty could have made amends at the other end when Greg Taylor was caught in possession, but he curled wide. Scotland's McGinn thumped past the post too as the game promised another goal.\n\nAnd that should have arrived when Ireland pulled the hosts apart. From Scotland's corner, Callum McGregor coughed up possession, the Irish broke two on one, Michael Obafemi laid the ball into the path of Parrott who saw the whites of Gordon's eyes but shot straight at him.\n\nThen a Gordon clearance bounced off Chiedozie Ogbene but back into the hands of the grateful goalkeeper. It was all Scotland possession, but Ireland were the ones passing up the chances.\n\nThe momentum shifted again in Scotland's favour. Ryan Fraser had a shot tipped over and Doherty defended brilliantly to head the ball away from McTominay.\n\nJust as Scotland's frustration grew as the winner looked to elude them, they were gifted a penalty when the hand of Browne diverted the ball from McTominay's path in the box.\n\nAfter a video assistant referee check, Christie slotted the penalty down the middle to bring Hampden to its feet. Ireland threw everything at Scotland in an attempt to find an equaliser but found a defence just as desperate to hold on.\n\nMan of the match - Jack Hendry\n\nHis defensive performance alone was enough to win the award, but he capped it with the equaliser to get Scotland back into the match\n\nDogged Scotland find a way - analysis\n\nIt was not the same flowing football from Wednesday, but the 90 minutes was just as pulsating as Scotland made it three straight wins.\n\nScotland's joy against Ukraine had come from their marauding full-backs and clever movement up front.\n\nTactically, though, Ireland were smart. Their two strikers pinned Scotland's wide players back, they defended their corners where Scotland had late joy in midweek. And despite Scotland having the lion's share of possession the Irish repeatedly found opportunities of their own.\n\nIt was a match that could have gone either way, but a penalty settled it.\n\nScotland did not have it all their own way as they did on Wednesday, but the confidence will be sky high before their rematch with Ukraine on Tuesday where Nations League promotion and a Euro 2024 play-off place are at stake.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nGroup B1 concludes on Tuesday, as Scotland take on Ukraine in Krakow, Poland (19:45 BST) and Republic of Ireland host Armenia at the same time.\n\n'Mentality doesn't change for Ukraine game' - Clarke\n\nMatch stats\n\nScotland are unbeaten in all eight of their home games in the Nations League (W7 D1) - no team has played more at home without ever losing in the competition (Italy also 8).\n\nRepublic of Ireland are winless in all seven of their away games in the competition (D2 L5), losing each of the last four.\n\nBoth teams scored with their first shots on target - for Scotland it was just the second time they'd conceded first in a home game in the Nations League (also v Israel in 2018), while it was the first time Ireland had scored first in an away game in the competition.\n\nIn his 33rd appearance for Scotland, Ryan Christie both scored and assisted a goal in the same game for the first time at international level.\n\nJack Hendry completed all 60 of his passes - the most a player has made while maintaining a 100% pass accuracy in this edition of the Nations League.\n\nJohn McGinn has created more chances (12) and had more shots (19) than any other Scotland player at this edition of the Nations League, with the midfielder having a further three of each against Ireland.",

He played for the Ireland U20s in 2020 and has made 32 senior appearances for Connacht.\n\nJoe McCarthy also played in both fixtures against the Maori All Blacks on the 2022 New Zealand Tour and played Ireland U20s with Prendergast in 2020. The second row has made 13 senior appearances for Leinster.\n\nThe Development Brief\n\nBoth Tom Ahern and Jamie Osborne trained with the Ireland squad as Development Players ahead of the 2021 Autumn Nations Series. Ahern was an Ireland U20 international in 2019 and 2020 missing the Grand Slam campaign through injury. He has made 21 senior appearances for Munster\n\nOsborne represented the Ireland U20s in 2021 but had already made his senior Leinster debut at that stage. He has made 20 senior appearances for Leinster.\n\nProven Provincials\n\nStewart Moore, Calvin Nash and Diarmuid Barron have all established themselves as senior Provincial players. All three represented Ireland at U20 World Rugby Championships.\n\nSince making his senior debut for Ulster in December 2019, Moore has accumulated 32 senior appearances. Nash has played 38 senior games for Munster, while Barron has 36 senior Munster caps.\n\nThe Class of 2019\n\nJohn Hodnett, Scott Penny, David McCann, Dylan Tierney-Martin, Brian Deeny, Jake Flannery, Thomas Clarkson, Michael Milne, Callum Reid and Josh Wycherley were all part of Ireland‚Äôs U20 Six Nations Grand Slam winning squad in 2019.\n\nAt Munster, Hodnett and Wycherley have made 22 and 29 senior provincial appearances respectively while Flannery made six senior appearances for Munster before making the switch to Ulster this season. McCann, who captained the U20s the following year, has made 15 senior appearances for Ulster with Reid clocking 11 appearances to date.\n\nTierney-Martin has made eight senior appearances for Connacht and scored a try against the Stormers at the weekend. Penny has made the most senior appearances for Leinster with 42 with Milne (18), Clarkson (18) and Deeny (3) also making the breakthrough at senior level for Leo Cullen‚Äôs side.\n\nThe Sevens Boys\n\nBaloucoune and Daly are not the only two players in the Emerging Ireland squad that have benefitted from exposure to the Ireland Sevens programme.\n\nAndrew Smith and Chay Mullins both won bronze medals at the recent Rugby World Cup Sevens in Cape Town while Cormac Izuchukwu won two Ireland Sevens caps before clocking nine senior appearances for Ulster.\n\nSmith also won the Energia AIL title with Clontarf earlier this year and has made two senior appearances for Leinster. Mullins has joined the Connacht Academy this season having also helped the Ireland U20s to a 2022 Six Nations Grand Slam.\n\nThe 2020 Triple Crowners\n\nThe 2020 U20 Six Nations was cut short by the Covid pandemic but after three games the Ireland U20 squad had secured wins over Scotland, Wales and England, claiming an unofficial Triple Crown. Ethan McIlroy, Jack Crowley, Tom Stewart and Ben Murphy were in that squad alongside the aforementioned Smith, McCann, Prendergast, Ahern and McCarthy.\n\nMcIlroy has made 37 senior appearances for Ulster while Stewart‚Äôs progress has been hampered by injury but he claimed an impressive try against Connacht in the first round of this season‚Äôs URC.\n\nOut-half Crowley has notched up 16 senior appearances for Munster including a start in the Champions Cup against Castres. Murphy has also made his senior debut for Leinster having gone on loan to Munster during the 2021/22 season.\n\nThe Class of 2021\n\nIn 2021, the U20 Six Nations took place in the summer months of June and July as the global pandemic continued to disrupt the rugby calender. Osborne featured strongly for the Richie Murphy‚Äôs side but so too did Nathan Doak, Cathal Forde and Sam Illo.\n\nDoak has already made a big impact at senior provincial level with Ulster clocking up 24 appearances since making his debut against Munster in December 2020. Forde has made two senior appearances for Connacht while Illo has featured three times since switching from the Leinster age grade system.\n\nInternational IQ Rugby\n\nThere are three players in the squad that have come through the Irish qualified player pathway. Mullins came via the Bristol Academy and the IRFU‚Äôs IQ programme in the UK.\n\nMichael McDonald was born in Ireland but represented Australia U20s at the 2019 U20 World Rugby Championship having emigrated down under with his family at the age of 13. He joined Ulster at the start of the current season.\n\nAntoine Frisch was born in France but qualifies for Ireland via his grandmother. He joined Munster this season from Premiership side Bristol Bears and made his Munster debut against Cardiff in the opening URC fixture of the 2022/23 season.\n\nRoman Salanoa was born in Hawaii but has qualified to play for Ireland through residency. He represented the USA at the 2016 U20 World Rugby Championship. Originally part of the Leinster development programme, Salanoa subsequently joined Munster and has made 10 senior appearances to date.\n\nNew Kid on the Block\n\nJames Culhane is yet to make his senior debut for Leinster but the powerful number eight left his mark on the 2022 U20 Six Nations. He was named Player of the Tournament as Ireland secured a memorable Grand Slam.",

    "Do you agree with our Ireland team to face Armenia?": "Goalkeeper/defence\n\nGavin Bazunu will retain his place in the side barring any last-minute injuries. Mark Travers is the man most likely to come in on the off chance that happens.\n\nThe back three all did relatively well against Scotland and so it would be a surprise if Kenny made changes. That said, there could be an outside chance Shane Duffy plays given his prowess from set pieces ‚Äî Ireland will need as many goal threats as possible on the pitch against a team that are likely to sit back and play a blanket defence at times.\n\nWing-backs\n\nMatt Doherty looked tired on occasions during the Scotland game, which is perhaps not a surprise, given that he has yet to start a competitive match for Spurs this season. Yet the alternate options aren‚Äôt strong ‚Äî 33-year-old Seamus Coleman‚Äôs days of playing 90 minutes/starting in that physically demanding role are probably behind him, and as well as he did for the games in June in Doherty‚Äôs absence, Alan Browne is not a natural wing-back and so picking him there ahead of the Tottenham man would be a big and somewhat controversial call.\n\nJames McClean did okay at the weekend and put in the corner for Ireland‚Äôs goal, but against a side as conservative as the Armenians, Kenny may favour the guile of Robbie Brady over the physicality and work rate of the Wigan star.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMidfield\n\nJosh Cullen is suspended so it will be a rare case of an Ireland game where the Burnley man is absent from the starting XI. There are a couple of candidates to come in but Conor Hourihane is perhaps the most natural replacement in that slightly deeper midfield role. His ability on set pieces against a side that may prove difficult to unlock is another factor working in his favour.\n\nIt was no surprise Kenny went for the energy of Jason Knight and Jayson Molumby in a game as combative as the Scotland fixture inevitably was going to be. However, the Irish boss might be tempted to play someone else in what will be a very different type of game.\n\nJeff Hendrick is arguably better than any other Irish midfielder in the squad at producing an incisive, defence-splitting through pass and with this in mind, it would be no surprise to see the 30-year-old ‚Äî who has made 10 appearances for a Reading team currently third in the Championship ‚Äî start the game. Alan Browne is another who could come in if Kenny seeks to freshen things up further, though the exuberance of Knight might be considered a better fit alongside two midfielders who are the wrong side of 30.\n\nCallum O‚ÄôDowda will likely have to settle for a place on the bench again, though his dribbling ability may prove useful at some point in proceedings.\n\nAttack\n\nProbably the area of the pitch with the tightest calls. When it comes to the Scotland game, Troy Parrott unfortunately will be most remembered for his costly miss when one-on-one with the goalkeeper, but the Preston loanee did well in general play, with some nice touches and a good work rate off the ball.\n\nMichael Obafemi also caught the eye and caused the Scottish defence problems with his pace, movement and eye for a pass. But the Swansea forward has to be managed carefully given his recent record with injuries and so Kenny may decide to hold him in reserve this time around.\n\nWhat are they\n\nreally like?

    "Ireland need Jeff Hendrick's influence off the bench in certain scenarios": "Irish Journalist Dan McDonnell joined Joe Molloy on The Football Show to discuss Ireland's midfield.\n\nIreland suffered a disappointing loss to Scotland in Hampden Park.\n\nIt was disappointing because they played well and still lost. Alan Browne's handball was silly. It gave Scotland the game-winning penalty, and there were plenty of other missed opportunities too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, Ireland played well for the most part. The back three of John Egan, Nathan Collins and Dara O'Shea excelled together. Michael Obafemi and Troy Parrott continue to develop their relationship. Matt Doherty returned in a decent display and the midfield trio battled hard for 90 minutes.\n\nBut there was a lack of control in Ireland's performance. Scotland showed their experience during the second half and Joe Molloy couldn't help but notice Ireland lacked that same quality.\n\n\"There were definitely periods in the second half when Scotland had control of the game,\" Molloy said.\n\n\"We almost did that too readily and you would love if that midfield three had almost said...'We might just try to take the sting out of this game a touch.' Now I don't know if that's experience or nous or maybe they were under strict instructions to get it forward, that's the way we hurt them.\n\n\"But that was definitely a feeling watching the game.\"\n\nDan McDonnell agreed with Molloy.\n\nNone of Cullen, Knight nor Molumby controlled possession or dictated the play. They weren't bad on the ball, but they didn't understand how or have the ability to slow the game down when Ireland needed them to.\n\nMcDonnell explains it's an area that Ireland are concerned about.\n\n\"To a degree this comes back to quality of player in this department,\" McDonnell said.\n\n\"There's no doubt that where Ireland lack depth at the minute is in those midfield positions...That midfield, Knight and Molumby, probably more so picked for their off the ball work rate than their on the ball abilities. Although Molumby I think has improved on the ball...and Knight is a very good player, but he's someone who makes breaks and latches onto attacks.\n\n\"You don't necessarily have [someone like] Callum McGregor who controls things a small bit more.\"\n\nWill Smallbone and Gavin Kilkenny are potential call-ups for the November internationals. The under-21 team doesn't have fixtures during that window. Smallbone is particularly exciting, but Kilkenny is closer to the quarterback-style passer who will sit deep and slow the game down when Ireland need him to.\n\nBut neither player is an option for Tuesday night and neither player is even guaranteed to make the next squad.\n\nInstead, Ireland can look at their current bench. Jeff Hendrick has more experience than any other Ireland midfielder. He played well for Kenny previously and McDonnell reckons he could have made a difference for Ireland on Saturday.\n\n\"He's an unpopular player with sections of the fanbase...something different would have been bringing in Jeff Hendrick. On a good day, and there have been good days under Kenny. [He's] a good passer and he has a bit of a presence.\n\n\"With his experience he could have taken a bit of the sting out of it. It was a bit frantic, the game in general.\"\n\nMatt Doherty is expecting big things.\n\nFootball on Off The Ball brought to you by Sky.

    "EU Cohesion Policy: ‚Ç¨1.4 billion for Ireland's economic and social development and green transition in 2021-2027": "Ireland will benefit from ‚Ç¨1.4 billion in Cohesion Policy funding between 2021-2027 to support the sustainable development of its economy.\n\nThe details and strategy for these investments are set out in the Partnership Agreement between Ireland and the Commission that is formally launched today.\n\nThese EU funds will help Ireland address regional disparities by boosting innovation and competitiveness, enabling the economy's digital transformation, investing in social inclusion, skills training and employment, and in the green transition.\n\nGreen transition, innovation and cross-border cooperation\n\n‚Ç¨396 million from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) will strengthen regional innovation ecosystems by improving the capacities of the newly created ‚ÄòTechnical Universities', which will function as regional knowledge hubs. Funds will also be invested to increase energy efficiency in housing, thereby helping families at risk of energy poverty, whilst contributing to the green and fair transition.\n\nERDF will also be of a great help for the revitalisation of town centres. The investments will improve the appearance and livability of medium sized and smaller towns in Ireland, in line with the principles of the New European Bauhaus.\n\nAdditionally, ‚Ç¨293 million will be allocated to European cross-border cooperation programmes for joint development and peace activities in the Northern Periphery and Atlantic areas and with Northwest Europe.\n\nFinally, ‚Ç¨84 million from the Just Transition Fund (JTF) will support Ireland's Midlands addressing the impact of the transition out of peat for electricity generation.\n\nEmployment and social inclusion\n\n‚Ç¨508 million from the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) will contribute to the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan and contribute to achieving EU-level social headline targets.\n\nOver half of the ESF+ envelope will contribute to reducing the risk of poverty and social exclusion, with an emphasis on disadvantaged groups. More than 20,000 vulnerable children will benefit from improved access to social services tailor-made to their individual needs. To facilitate the social and employment integration of disadvantaged communities of people with a migrant background, the ESF+ will also finance mentoring, language and social skills training.\n\nESF+ funding will also improve the chances of people to get a job by providing training to up-and reskill, lifelong learning, and education measures. There will be a focus on assisting people who face greater challenges on the labour market, including over 6,000 persons with disabilities. In total, the programme aims to help 90,000 jobseekers to participate in a training course to develop new skills by 2029.\n\nSustainable fisheries, aquaculture and processing sector\n\nAround ‚Ç¨142 million from the European Maritime Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund (EMFAF) will enable the adaptation of the Irish fishing and aquaculture sectors to the present challenges. The funding will support the implementation of the Common Fisheries Policy, the growth of a sustainable blue economy and healthy, safe and sustainably management of seas and oceans. Investments in the fisheries and aquaculture sectors will also contribute to the green transition in Ireland, by promoting development of small-scale coastal fisheries through community-led local development.\n\nMembers of the College said:\n\nCommissioner for Cohesion and Reforms, Elisa Ferreira, said: ‚ÄúFollowing today's adoption of the Partnership Agreement, Ireland will receive support to further develop its economy in a fair and green manner, ensuring that no region is left behind. Since its accession to the EU in 1973, the country has benefitted from Cohesion Policy funds to support its transformation to a modern, innovation-led economy. Support under this new Partnership Agreement will continue to boost innovation across Irish regions, while also contributing to the green transition and to the quality of life in Irish towns. Ireland has a far-reaching smart, green and digital future ahead.‚Äù\n\nCommissioner for Jobs and Social Rights, Nicolas Schmit, added: ‚ÄúIn these challenging times, having a fair and inclusive labour market and society is more important than ever. The ESF+ will make a positive difference in the everyday life of people in Ireland, especially focusing on those who need extra support, helping them to find new jobs, learn innovative skills and protecting them from poverty and social exclusion.‚Äù\n\nCommissioner for Environment, Oceans and Fisheries, Virginijus Sinkeviƒçius, said: ‚ÄúThis Partnership Agreement will create favourable conditions to support the development of a sustainable blue economy in the coastal, island and inland areas of Ireland. It will play a central role in increasing the resilience of fishing and aquaculture sectors, while enhance the protection of the marine environment and biodiversity. It will also support coastal communities and contribute to Ireland's pledge for a carbon neutral economy by 2050.‚Äù\n\nBackground\n\nUnder Cohesion Policy, and in cooperation with the Commission, each Member State prepares a Partnership Agreement, a strategic document for programming investments from the Cohesion Policy funds ‚Äì ERDF, ESF+, and the Cohesion Fund ‚Äì the JTF and the EMFAF during the Multiannual Financial Framework.\n\nThe Partnership Agreements focus on EU priorities, laying down the strategy and investment priorities identified by each Member State. They present a list of National and Regional Programmes adapted to the needs of the country for implementation of the investments on the ground, including the indicative annual financial allocation for each programme.\n\nThe Partnership Agreement with Ireland is the 22nd to be adopted following those of Greece, Germany, Austria, Czechia, Lithuania, Finland, Denmark, France, Sweden, the Netherlands, Poland, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Portugal, Estonia, Slovakia, Italy, Romania, Croatia, Slovenia and Malta.",

    "Ireland joins EU hawks on Russia, as outrage spreads": "Ireland has joined Poland and the Baltic states in lobbying for more hawkish Russia sanctions, in a sign of widening moral outrage in Europe.\n\nThe Irish added their \"IE\" stamp to a 9-page long list of proposals, including bank and diamond industry bans, circulated in Brussels and seen by EUobserver on Friday (23 September).\n\nStudent or retired?

A second EU diplomat speculated that the US, which has close ties with Ireland, might have urged Dublin to side with Warsaw against more dovish EU capitals.\n\n\"We hope even more will join the group,\" a Polish diplomat said.\n\nBut a fourth EU diplomat said it wasn't so surprising, given Ireland's record of \"maximalist\" positions on human-rights issues.\n\nThe Irish-backed proposals say Russian lenders Gazprombank, Alfa Bank, Rosbank, and Tinkoff Bank should be cut off from the 'Swift' international payments grid.\n\nA Gazprombank ban would have far-reaching consequences because it handles payments for Russian gas exports.\n\n\"It shall be prohibited to purchase, import, or transfer, directly or indirectly, diamonds ... if they originate in Russia and if they have been exported from Russia into the [European] Union or to any third country,\" the group also proposed to add to the EU's sanctions regime. Russian diamond exports are worth ‚Ç¨4bn a year.\n\nThey called for a \"ban on cooperating with Russia on nuclear energy\", on the transfer of EU or US cash banknotes to Russia, and on sales of real estate to Russians.\n\nIn the services sector, the EU should impose a \"ban on using Kaspersky Lab [a Russian cybersecurity giant] technology\" inside Europe and stop EU firms from doing IT work for Russian clients, the group said.\n\nOn the counter-propaganda front, they proposed taking three Russian TV broadcasters (NTV Mir, REN TV, and Rossija 1), as well as six online ones (NewsFront, SouthFront, Katehon, Strategic Culture Foundation, Fondsk, and InfoRos), off the airwaves.\n\nThey also wanted an explicit ban on Russian funding for EU-registered lobbying firms, NGOs, and think-thanks.\n\nThey said people who help Russia to circumvent sanctions should themselves be put on EU visa-ban and asset-freeze blacklists.\n\nAnd they listed dozens of high-tech products that should no longer be exported to the EU's war-mongering neighbour, including smartphones, radar equipment, and laser appliances.\n\nArt of the possible\n\nThe proposals come as Russia-occupied regions in eastern Ukraine begin fake referendums on independence, leading to Russian annexation as early as next week.\n\nAll 27 EU countries are to hold talks with the EU Commission over the weekend on the feasibility of sanctions ideas.\n\n\"The Commission has carried out consultations with national capitals, so it's in the best position to know what would be acceptable to everyone,\" another EU diplomat said.\n\nThe minimum the EU will do is blacklist officials involved in the bogus referendums, list a few minor Russian banks, and ban some high-tech products, diplomats predicted.\n\nThey will also try to stop firms shipping Russian oil sold at inflated prices, for instance by invalidating insurance coverage for tankers involved in the trade.\n\nThe eighth round of sanctions comes after the EU already listed 1,206 Russians and struck out at most sectors of the Russian economy, leaving few big targets left.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Poland and the Baltic States make headway with Irish support.\n\nRussia-friendly Hungary has in the past vetoed blacklistings and is up to its neck in nuclear cooperation with Russian firm Rosatom, which is building two reactors at Hungary's Paks atomic plant.\n\nFrance, Germany, and Italy, as well as smaller countries, such as Austria, Cyprus, and Greece, are also more dovish than Poland and the Baltic states.\n\nAnd some EU sources saw the Irish-Polish-Baltic paper as more of a roadmap for action further down the line, than as a list of demands to be implemented in reaction to the annexations.\n\n\"It's more of a reflection paper, showing the direction of travel,\" an EU contact said.",

The Declaration, he declared, ‚Äúis a significant milestone,‚Äù which includes a number of ambitions actions to address impacts of these weapons.\n\nHowever, Mr. Martin also reported Ireland‚Äôs deep frustration at many aspects of the Council. He mentioned the failure to adopt a resolution on Climate and Security, after it was vetoed by Russia, and claimed that the Council has not acted decisively to deal with the situation in Tigray, northern Ethiopia.\n\nHe went on to note Ireland‚Äôs firm commitment to a two-State solution in Israel and Palestine, but said that ‚Äúwe are no nearer today to that aim than we were when we joined the Council 18 months ago; and, truth be told, long before that‚Äù, citing the continued building of Israeli settlements that, he said, ‚Äúcontinue to undermine the viability and territorial contiguity of a future Palestinian State, and to jeopardise the two-State solution‚Äù.\n\nOn Afghanistan, Mr. Martin pointed to Ireland‚Äôs defence of the human rights of the Afghan people, particularly women and girls, and we have increased our humanitarian aid. ‚ÄúThe mandate for the UN mission in Afghanistan, adopted in March, was directly informed by the courageous activism of Afghan women,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúand we have pushed for accountability for the Taliban‚Äôs actions‚Äù.\n\nIncreased humanitarian aid\n\nTurning to the issue of global food insecurity, Mr. Martin said that Ireland has responded to the crisis by increasing humanitarian aid, contributing 78 million Euro for the Horn of Africa, and funding other severely affected countries and regions, including Yemen, Afghanistan and the Sahel.\n\nOther initiatives include an additional ‚Ç¨50 million over three years specifically to tackle acute child malnutrition, increased core funding to the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), and funding and programming for humanitarian emergencies that is adapted to underpin the country‚Äôs climate, development and peacebuilding interventions.\n\nIreland will make a new contribution of ‚Ç¨65 million over three years to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, a 30 per cent increase on previous contributions, to support the Fund‚Äôs important work against these diseases, and the related strengthening of health systems, he continued.\n\nMr. Martin said that hunger and conflict are a priority for Ireland‚Äôs Security Council term: ‚Äúconflict is now the main driver of hunger, reversing gains made over the last decades. We are failing in the challenge to reach zero hunger‚Äù.\n\nHe added that Ireland has committed to helping partner countries on their journey towards sustainable, resilient, and nutritious food systems, and declared that, at the COP27 UN climate conference in November, Ireland will be at the forefront of efforts to combat the climate emergency.",
    "Preview: Ireland U21s chase the dream in Israel": "It was honours even after the European Under-21 Championship play-off first leg at Tallaght Stadium on Friday night, but the sense in the aftermath was it's advantage Israel ahead of the return game on Tuesday.\n\nIreland had the chances to establish a good lead in Dublin.\n\nThe impressive Aaron Connolly, Willl Smallbone and Eiran Cashin all went close before Idan Gorno struck for the visitors with a header from a corner. Evan Ferguson soared to glance home a deserved second-half equaliser, but Ireland are facing a massive challenge in Tel Aviv, where temperatures are expected to be around 28 degrees come kick-off time.\n\nIsrael have shown Crawford's team ample respect by calling back three players from the senior squad for the second leg.\n\nCeltic attacker Liel Abada, Olympiacos full-back Doron Leidner and Eden Kartsev of Maccabi Tel Aviv are all available having helped the seniors to a 2-1 UEFA Nations League win over Albania on Saturday.\n\nHowever Crawford will not be doing likewise, despite Gavin Bazunu, Troy Parrott, Nathan Collins, Jason Knight and Michael Obafemi being eligible. They will stick with Stephen Kenny's senior squad for the Aviva Stadium clash against Armenia.\n\nMeanwhile Crawford remains upbeat and quietly confident his charges are good enough to make history and qualify Ireland for a first ever major finals at the U-21 grade.\n\n\"I thought it was a very good performance on Friday,\" he told RT√â Sport.\n\n\"It was disappointing to concede a goal from a set play. It's something we work a lot on, but these things happen. The players showed resilience and character to get themselves back into the game.\n\n\"I do think we can raise our game even more with the players we have. I have no doubt we'll be able to do that.\n\n\"Of course you'd have regrets you missed chances. On another day we could have been a coupe of goals up after the first leg, and I think the real measure of our performance was that they have drafted down three players from the senior team. It's going to be a stiffer challenge, there's not doubt about it, but I think with the quality we have in our squad, we'll be okay.\"\n\n\"I do think we can raise our game even more with the players we have\" - Ireland U21s boss Jim Crawford spoke to @darrenfrehill ahead of Tuesday's massive Euros play-off in Israel, live on the @RTEplayer (6.15pm ko) #RTEsoccer pic.twitter.com/bOyfm2fYF6 ‚Äî RT√â Soccer (@RTEsoccer) September 26, 2022\n\nFerguson is nursing an ankle knock but he's expected to be OK. Bar that, Ireland have a clean bill of health.\n\nHaving really gone at the Israelis in Tallaght, the complexion of the game is likely to be a lot different at Bloomfield Stadium. Certainly Israel will look to take the game to their hosts a lot more, buoyed by the returning trio of Abada, Leidner and Kartsev, plus a partisan crowd that will expect them to play on the front foot.\n\nCrawford also admitted that the heat may dictate the Irish approach.\n\n\"You have to factor that in too, to go after a team for 90 minutes in those type of conditions can be challenging,\" he added.\n\n\"You've got to pick and choose your moments to get after teams. Our boys are clever enough. They'll be well versed on what we've got to do.\"\n\nThere's some seasoned Irish campaigners who have been with the group for a long time now. Among them is Lee O'Connor, the tigerish Tranmere Rovers caps full-back desperate to make the big breakthrough.\n\nO'Connor has been a mainstay of Ireland squads from U-15s up. This is his last campaign in underage international football, and he wants to make it count.\n\n\"I've said it many times, there's nothing like it... it's just a different kind of feeling when you play for Ireland,\" O'Connor said.\n\n\"It's something I've love since my very first game. That's why I've made sure I could come to every sing camp I could go to.\n\n\"It's a big game for all of us but it's 90 minutes of football - and a chance to make history at the end.\n\n\"We're all confident. We know it's going to be a tough game. We know what needs to be done. To be be the first to do it, you'd go down in history. That's all we're thinking about.\"\n\nConfident, determined and together - it's set up to be a special night for the Republic of Ireland.\n\nListen to the RT√â Soccer podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nFollow Israel v Republic of Ireland in the UEFA Under-21 European Championship second-leg play-off this Tuesday (KO 6.15pm) via our liveblog on RT√â.ie/sport and the RT√â News app, or watch live on the RT√â Player (Island of Ireland).",

    "Can Ireland's bumper savings be put to good use?": "Limited spending options and fears of what was to come turned Irish consumers into great savers during pandemic lockdowns.\n\nEven as the economy reopened, the average household was saving far more of their income than before ‚Äì though recent data suggests the rising prices are forcing that to change.\n\nThis means that there is a huge bulk of money sitting in Irish bank accounts at the moment ‚Äì right at a time when households, businesses and politicians search for ways to cover the rising cost of living.\n\nHow much money do people here have saved?\n\nWe need your consent to load this rte-player contentWe use rte-player to manage extra content that can set cookies on your device and collect data about your activity. Please review their details and accept them to load the content.Manage Preferences\n\nA huge amount ‚Äì somewhere in the region of ‚Ç¨146 billion by the end of July, according to the most recent figures from the Central Bank.\n\nTo put that into context, the upcoming budget is estimated to be worth around ‚Ç¨6.5 billion‚Äì and that's a far bigger figure than it would be in a normal year, because of the billions of euro that are planned around the cost of living.\n\nSo the people of Ireland have more than 22 bumper budgets worth of cash sitting in their bank accounts at the moment.\n\nAnd that figure has ballooned significantly in the past two and a half years ‚Äì because people saved an extraordinary amount during the pandemic.\n\nComparing the February 2020 figure with the July 2022 figure, there‚Äôs nearly ‚Ç¨35 billion more in our savings. That‚Äôs the kind of money it would normally take a decade or more to build up.\n\nIt works out at about ‚Ç¨28,600 for every person in the country.\n\nBut I don‚Äôt have anything like that in my bank account‚Ä¶\n\nUnfortunately, all of that money isn‚Äôt very evenly distributed.\n\nAnd, unsurprisingly, it‚Äôs the country‚Äôs higher earners that tend to hold the bulk of the money saved.\n\nIt should be said that most people in the country do have some level of savings ‚Äì recent figures from the Central Statistics Office says that nearly 97% of households have some form of savings.\n\nBut the amount in those savings accounts tends to decline in line with the amount of disposable income a person has.\n\nThere are also links between the likelihood of having savings and your level of education, and whether someone is living in their own house or whether they‚Äôre renting.\n\nAnd that inequality in savings was only enhanced by the pandemic.\n\nIf you were to take two types of workers ‚Äì let‚Äôs say, a high-earning tech worker, and regular retail worker.\n\nThere‚Äôs already a huge difference in their earnings here ‚Äì but when the pandemic hit, the tech worker was able to continue doing their job from home, pretty much with no interruption.\n\nThat means their earnings stayed the same, in some cases they actually increased, and because they couldn‚Äôt go anywhere, suddenly all of their socialising money started building up in their bank account.\n\nThe retail worker also wouldn‚Äôt have had much available to spend their money on, but because they were forced to stop working altogether, and put onto the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, they didn‚Äôt have much in the way of disposable income left once their bills were taken care of.\n\nAre we still saving our money?\n\nAs the economy began to reopen, there was lots of discussion about what might happen with all of the savings built up during the height of the pandemic.\n\nThere were some ‚Äì particularly retailers ‚Äì who hoped that there might be some kind of post-lockdown spending spree.\n\nConsumer spending did rise ‚Äì and some people seemed to put their savings towards some big ticket items, like a trip abroad. Some of the rapid rise in house prices has also been attributed to people directing their savings towards a deposit on a new home.\n\nBut while spending has been higher than before, it‚Äôs definitely not been the splurge that some had expected.\n\nIn fact, so far it seems as though people have continued their savings habit even as life returned to normal.\n\nThe most recent Household Savings stats from the CSO shows that people were still putting away almost 20% of their income in the middle of the year.\n\nThat‚Äôs about double the pre-pandemic average.\n\nPerhaps people realised that they were able to save more than they previously thought possible ‚Äì or perhaps it shows that households are remaining cautious, particularly given the context of the war in Ukraine and talk of a recession in the Euro Zone.\n\nIt should be said, though, that these CSO figures only bring us to June ‚Äì before the cost of living crisis really started to bite.\n\nA more recent survey from the Bank of Ireland shows that people are now saving less than they feel they should, because they simply can‚Äôt afford to.\n\nSo if we‚Äôre not spending it, what options do savers have to get the most out of their money?\n\nWell, if they‚Äôre looking to save it ‚Äì there‚Äôs not a lot on offer at the moment.\n\nAcross the board, savings accounts are offering next to nothing in terms of interest ‚Äì and that‚Äôs been the case ever since the European Central Bank dropped its interest rates to zero.\n\nECB interest rates are on the rise but so far the main Irish banks ‚Äì outside of tracker mortgages - haven‚Äôt yet passed those on.\n\nThat‚Äôs good news for those on a variable mortgage, or someone with a personal loan, but it‚Äôs bad news for savers, because it means they‚Äôre not yet benefitting from the interest rate.\n\nFor those looking for a return on their money, investments are of course an option ‚Äì but only if you have a lump sum of money that you‚Äôre happy to put out of reach for a couple of years.\n\nAnd, unlike savings, there‚Äôs no guarantee with investments ‚Äì so you could end up losing money, or not making an awful lot.\n\nGenerally it‚Äôs about balancing risk and reward with this kind of thing ‚Äì if you want the best chance of making a great return, you need to make riskier investments.\n\nIf you want to be sure you don‚Äôt lose money, you‚Äôre going to have to go with something that promises fairly modest returns.\n\nTake, for example, a 10 Year National Solidarity Bond‚Äì which is 100% guaranteed by the State.\n\nIf you put ‚Ç¨1,000 into that today, in 10 years time you‚Äôll get back ‚Ç¨1,100.\n\nAnd with the current rate of inflation‚Ä¶\n\nThe is the problem facing all people saving at the moment ‚Äì they‚Äôre getting little or nothing for their money, and the value of that money is being whittled away by the month.\n\nFor example, if you put that ‚Ç¨1,000 into your savings at the start of the pandemic, in terms of buying power, it‚Äôs now effectively worth less than ‚Ç¨890 because of inflation.\n\nThe rate of inflation is expected to tail off over the next year or two ‚Äì but it‚Äôs still going to be higher than desired, which means your money is slowly losing value while it‚Äôs earning you nothing.\n\nSo what other options do savers have?\n\nWell, they could spend the money ‚Äì though due to inflation there‚Äôs not much value to be had, especially if they were thinking of doing something like a home renovation or upgrade.\n\nPeople may also be unwilling to let go of their savings at the moment, for fear that they need it to fall back on if their household budgets get squeezed even further, or if there‚Äôs another economic downturn that threatens their income.\n\nAnd the general personal finance advice is to keep a certain amount of cash to hand at all times ‚Äì just in case your income suddenly stops, or the washing machine breaks down.\n\nSo using up all of your savings isn‚Äôt a good idea either way.\n\nBut assuming you have money beyond that recommended buffer, paying off debt is probably a good use of money at the moment, especially if it‚Äôs high interest lending like on a credit card.\n\nThe most recent Central Bank statistics tell us that household debt stood at ‚Ç¨128 billion late last year ‚Äì so not too far behind what we have saved.\n\nIf people have the money to clear some of that, it might mean reducing or even wiping out a loan repayment altogether, which will bolster their monthly budget as they head into the winter.\n\nIn fact, even if you‚Äôre just paying off a part of a loan ‚Äì like your mortgage ‚Äì it will ultimately stand to you.\n\nAnother option is to put money towards a pension.\n\nFor many this is about as long-term of an investment as you can make, but we do know that a lack of pensions provision is a major issue in Ireland, and it takes a long time for people to build up the kind of pension pot that they would like to have a comfortable retirement.\n\nIs there any way for the Government to tap into those savings?\n\nWell it kind of does already ‚Äì for example, any interest earned is liable to Deposit Interest Retention Tax ‚Äì or DIRT ‚Äì at 33%.\n\nThough, given that people haven‚Äôt been earning much on their savings for the past few years, there isn‚Äôt really much money to be made from that tax at the moment.\n\nThe State Savings scheme, including things like the National Solidarity Bond and Prize Bonds are effective an attempt by Government to benefit from people‚Äôs savings, too.\n\nThat‚Äôs because they‚Äôre effectively a way for the State to borrow citizens‚Äô money for an extended period of time, which they can then use for various investments and public services.\n\nBeyond that, though, the Government is actually in a bit of a bind when it comes to people‚Äôs savings.\n\nNormally if you were looking at businesses around the country struggling on the one hand, and billions and billions sitting in savings accounts on the other, it would make sense to try to come up with a scheme to try to unleash that cash in order to help businesses out.\n\nThink of some kind of reverse SSIA scheme that incentivises spending rather than saving.\n\nBut, if you were to do that, you run the risk of simply adding to the inflation problem at the moment ‚Äì which would only prolong the pain that consumers and companies are facing right now.\n\nSo, as counter-intuitive as it seems, the Government probably doesn‚Äôt want too much money coming into the economy right now.\n\nIn fact, that‚Äôs partly why a central bank raises interest rates when it wants to cool economic activity. Because higher interest rates on your savings account ‚Äì in theory at least ‚Äì encourages you to save rather than spend.",

    "Scotland U21 1-1 Northern Ireland U21: Flynn Clarke's debut goal not enough": "Last updated on .From the section Scotland\n\nClarke opened the scoring after only three minutes\n\nNorwich City winger Flynn Clarke scored on his Scotland Under-21 debut as Northern Ireland fought back to draw in a friendly in Paisley.\n\nClarke's third-minute strike gave Scot Gemmell's side the perfect start, slotting between goalkeeper and club-mate Dylan Berry's legs after Lucas de Bolle played him through.\n\nHowever, it was cancelled out when Nottingham Forest striker Dale Taylor swept in a cross from the left to equalise for the visitors after 17 minutes.\n\nThe draw followed a 3-1 victory for the Scots in Belfast on Thursday, when 16-year-old Liverpool winger Ben Doak scored his first at this level.\n\nWith a fresh cycle of players stepping into the set-up, Gemmell was able to hand four debuts in the starting 11 alone, with Alloa Athletic goalkeeper Jay Hogarth, Coventry City left-back Josh Reid and Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Matthew Craig also all coming in.\n\nBut it was Clarke who made an instant impression after Hamilton Academical midfielder De Bolle weighted his ball through beautifully and the 19-year-old provided an impressive finish.\n\nTaylor had already forced Hogarth to make himself big to save before the 18-year-old already capped by Northern Ireland's senior side levelled the game.\n\nDriving down the left, Chris McKee, the former Rangers forward now at Linfield, held off a couple of challenges, crossed low to find Taylor and the striker's first-time shot nestled in the net.\n\nThe Northern Ireland striker was a menace all afternoon and another shot rippled the side netting, while De Bolle drilled just wide from the edge of the area at the other end.\n\nSubstitute Doak's pace created Scotland's best chance of the second-half for Tommy Conway, but Berry showed good instincts to turn it behind before saving from Josh Mulligan's header from the resulting corner.",
    "Royal London Becomes Ireland's First Pension Provider in a Decade": "Royal London Ireland has become the first new pension provider in Ireland for over a decade, and the first life assurance company provider to enter the Irish pensions market for more than 30 years.\n\nThe British life and pensions provider has announced the development of new pensions produdts that will be offered exclusively through financial brokers.\n\nThe company will initially offer a personal retirement bond (PRB) and an approved retirement fund (ARF) without policy fees or fund switching charges, plus automatic portfolio rebalance and ValueShare, a payment that will be added to customer fund returns in years that the company does well.\n\nNoel Freeley, CEO of Royal London Ireland, commented: \"Following several years of behind-the-scenes work, intense consultation with financial brokers and a multi-million capital investment, we have been able to create a compelling pension proposition that will deliver value for money and competitive pricing for customers, combined with access to two leading asset managers Royal London Asset Management (RLAM) and BlackRock.\n\n\"Underpinned by strong customer service, our pension products will provide positive competition in terms of innovation, pricing and transparency, with no fixed or monetary policy fees or fund switching charges.\n\n\"This expansion represents the next stage of development in our ongoing growth in Ireland. We‚Äôre in a position where we‚Äôre market leader in broker protection products and where we have increased our broker protection estimated market share from 22.5% to 30.2% since 2020, so we have a strong distribution platform to build from.\"\n\nNoel Feeley said Royal London's entry was the result of several years of work and investment.\n\n‚ÄúThe competition in Ireland‚Äôs pensions market has been largely unchanged for some time. New entrants are rare, primarily due to the level of investment required to deliver a high-value product and the expertise demanded to build a robust service support platform.\n\nIn the UK, Royal London is the largest mutual life and pensions provider, with responsibility for more than 21,000 workplace pensions schemes and 1.6m members.\n\nAssets under management by Royal London Asset Management total ‚Ç¨174bn, including funds managed on behalf of third parties. BlackRock has nearly $8.5tn in assets under management.\n\nFreeley said he hoped Royal London's expansion into the pension market would illustrate the company's ambitions for Royal London Ireland to replicate the group's success in the UK.\n\n\"Benefiting from a mutual parent company, our pension products have been driven by our mutual mindset which aims to help customers build their financial resilience and invest in a responsible way that delivers a world worth retiring into,\" he continued.\n\n\"We believe that the impartial advice provided by a Financial Broker can make a huge difference. Service from providers has been a big challenge across the Irish pension sector over the last 12-18 months.\n\n\"Royal London Ireland is well positioned to address this service deficit utilising our breadth of experience in the life insurance sector in providing award-winning service.‚Äù",

    "Ben Collins ‚Äì Unionists are already having conversations about a united Ireland": "Ben Collins's new book Irish Unity ‚Äì Time to Prepare\n\nFor me the Good Friday Agreement was an amazing achievement. It brought to an end the Troubles and secured the peace, however imperfect, which we now enjoy. On a personal level it also enabled me to think about my own sense of identity and how I wanted to see Northern Ireland develop. It allowed me to think about a united Ireland and whether I wanted there to be one, in a way which had not been possible before. Until that point I was determined that I was not going to be forced into a united Ireland through violence or the threats of violence.\n\nI had been a student in Dundee while the Good Friday Agreement was negotiated and returned to Belfast just after the referendum had passed. There was a sense of hope that Northern Ireland could become an economic powerhouse. We are still waiting for that to happen. After the Northern Ireland Assembly collapsed in 2001 I returned to Scotland. I had joined the Conservatives just before I moved because I believed in enterprise and was keen to get involved with bread and butter politics. While I had hoped and expected that Ken Clarke would become leader and take the party in a more liberal and pro-European direction, the opposite happened. I was alarmed at their increasing hostility towards Europe. At the same time I heard the SNP talk about fiscal autonomy which really appealed to me. I left the Conservative party after two years.\n\nBeing away from Northern Ireland I was able to embrace my growing sense of Irishness and desire for Irish unity. The beauty of the Good Friday Agreement was that you could be Irish, British, European or all three. Borders were increasingly irrelevant until the EU referendum. While I realised that the vote would be a lot closer than people originally thought, I was genuinely shocked when the UK, or more specifically England and Wales voted for Brexit.\n\nWhile Irish unity had been a long term aspiration of mine, it became an urgent necessity for me after the vote for Brexit. The six years since the vote have been distressing and unsettling in many ways. Members of my own immediate family and close friends voted for Brexit. I do not think that anyone is happy with how it has turned out. My sense of Britishness had dissipated over time and seeing elderly men in Sunderland celebrating the vote to leave the European Union struck me as such an alien idea.\n\nThe idea to write a book on Irish unity came to me in July 2012 just before the London Olympics. I could tell that politics across the UK was changing when the Scottish referendum was called. The UK government intended to win by a clear two to one margin to put the issue to rest for a generation, but the final vote was much closer. It was only after the Brexit vote that I decided to focus seriously on setting out my thoughts on how we could achieve a New Ireland.\n\nI know that Irish unity has been an aspirational ideal for many people for a long time. But when you consider the damage which is being done to the island of Ireland by Brexit, there is now a hard-headed rationale for planning and preparing now.\n\nLike several thousand other people I will be travelling to Dublin on Saturday to attend the Ireland‚Äôs Future event ‚ÄòTogether We Can‚Äô in the 3Arena and I look forward to speaking at it. While political unionism rarely engages in the debate on Irish unity, I know from personal experience that people from unionist backgrounds are already taking part in this conversation. It may not often be happening out in the open, but these discussions are taking place. Often these private chats will cover the same points, Brexit is a disaster, Westminster is dysfunctional and political unionism is completely out of touch. People are open to a different future but they want to know what this will involve and what will it mean for them and their families. In a very small way I hope to add to this conversation with my book ‚ÄòIrish Unity: Time to Prepare‚Äô and play my part in helping us to plan and prepare in advance of the border poll which I think is likely at some point over the next decade. I believe that we can win that vote and it will be a success if we have a plan in place beforehand.\n\n:: 'Irish Unity: Time to Prepare' by Ben Collins is published by Luath Press and will be launched at Belfast's Linen Hall Library on Thursday October 6.",

    "Ireland ambassador to UK urges negotiations to solve Brexit issues": "(Alliance News) - Ireland's ambassador to the UK has stressed the need to find a negotiated solution to the problems surrounding Northern Ireland's post-Brexit arrangements.\n\nMartin Fraser said he was an optimist about the chances of resolving the issues around the Northern Ireland protocol but the situation was currently in the \"words phase\" and had to move to the \"actions phase\".\n\nThe UK government is legislating to effectively tear up parts of the agreement, which sets out how goods flowing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland are treated.\n\nFraser, speaking at a fringe event at the Labour Party conference in Liverpool, said the protocol was the only way to resolve the problems caused by Brexit.\n\nThe agreement, signed by then prime minister Boris Johnson's government, effectively keeps Northern Ireland aligned with many EU single market rules to avoid a hard border with Ireland, therefore requiring some checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea.\n\nDevolution in the region has been in flux since February when the DUP withdrew its first minister from the governing executive in protest at the economic border created in the Irish Sea by the protocol.\n\nFraser acknowledged there were \"legitimate concerns\" but said: \"How do we solve it? We solve it by negotiating through the issues that are there.\n\n\"From our point of view, from the EU, we solve it by implementing the protocol that was agreed with the British government, which the British government signed and fought an election, passed through Parliament.\n\n\"We think it's the best and only solution.

    "Killing Leprechauns: Irish satirist mines British ignorance in comedy podcast": "When Oliver Cromwell‚Äôs forces sacked the Irish town of Drogheda in 1649 and massacred its inhabitants the comedy potential seemed limited. Thousands perished and that was just the start of a military campaign that wiped out much of Ireland‚Äôs population before Cromwell returned to England.\n\nFour centuries later, however, those dark events and other landmarks of Irish history have been mined for humour ‚Äì and the joke is on the British.\n\nOliver Callan, an Irish satirist, has questioned British comedians about their knowledge of Ireland and uncovered an apparently deep well of ignorance. For Killing Leprechauns, a six-part BBC podcast that launches on Saturday, Callan asked a dozen young comics about Irish stereotypes, history and current affairs. The general response: obliviousness.\n\nIt validated the old joke about the Irish never forgetting their history and the British never remembering theirs, Callan said in an interview. ‚ÄúIt was much worse than I expected.‚Äù\n\nThe comedians appeared unaware that Britain‚Äôs closest neighbour had a young population and tech-driven economy, he said. ‚ÄúTheir view is it‚Äôs still an old place, mass-going, the Catholic church still has a grip, we‚Äôre still backward; it‚Äôs a misty, old-fashioned country that‚Äôs taken to the drink.‚Äù\n\nComedians tend to consume a lot of media and to focus on what audiences find familiar, said Callan. ‚ÄúSo if British comedians don‚Äôt know about Ireland and aren‚Äôt talking about Irishness, it‚Äôs indicative that their audiences don‚Äôt either and this is because their media and their establishment are not paying attention.‚Äù\n\nOliver Callan, centre, with Josh Jones and Sophie Duker who take part in the podcast.\n\nIn the series Callan pokes fun at the Irish, suggesting they were created when a red-haired rabbit copulated with a long streak of misery that floated through upper Cavan. But after prodding his guests to recount Irish tropes, such as drunkenness, he responded with facts and statistics that challenged the stereotypes.\n\nThe comedians, who include Rhys James, Glenn Moore, Ana Magliano, Josh Weller and Sophie Duker, submitted themselves to tests on their ‚ÄúMick ignorance‚Äù, regarding Irish culture, and a segment called ‚ÄúGreat Britain or hate Britain‚Äù that asked them how aspects of Britishness are regarded in Ireland.\n\nFew were aware of Cromwell‚Äôs record in Ireland, though James recalled learning in school the Puritan leader had invaded and irked the natives with ‚Äúcosmic ways‚Äù. Told about massacres and that Drogheda‚Äôs governor was beaten to death with his wooden leg, James replied, tongue in cheek: ‚ÄúNow you‚Äôve told me I‚Äôm furious about it, mate. If you‚Äôre listening in Ireland, I‚Äôm livid about it.‚Äù\n\nKnowledge about the Great Famine was scant but Callan said the Irish extracted a revenge of sort when the resulting emigrant tide to Britain produced an infamous descendent, Piers Morgan. ‚ÄúSo things have a way of evening out.‚Äù\n\nThe British comedians were fuzzy about √âamon de Valera, who dominated Irish politics for much of the 20th century, but noted his name‚Äôs resemblance to ‚Äúdevil‚Äù and Cruella de Vil.\n\nQuestions about Ireland‚Äôs taoiseach, Miche√°l Martin, and his predecessor Leo Varadkar, Ireland‚Äôs first openly gay and mixed-race leader, drew a blank. The comedians were surprised to learn Joe Biden, John F Kennedy and other US presidents celebrated their Irish roots, and that Ireland had become a liberal, secular state.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Irish people followed British TV, British sport, British politics, but Britons showed little awareness or interest in Ireland. ‚ÄúOur intense focus on British matters is not even reciprocated at a micro level.‚Äù\n\nBritons had little reason to share navel-gazing Irish obsessions such as Biden‚Äôs Irish heritage but it was a shame they did not follow the example of King Charles, his late mother and other members of the royal family who have visited and engaged with Ireland, said Callan.\n\nThe satirist said Irish people had their own blinkers, such as ignorance about Northern Ireland and aspects of Britain, especially its geography. ‚ÄúWe couldn‚Äôt place many cities on a map.‚Äù Brexit gave the Irish licence to create their own stereotypes, he said. ‚ÄúWe milked it quite a bit to portray Britain as narrow-minded.‚Äù Even so, the Irish yearned for attention. ‚ÄúWe just want the Brits to notice us.‚Äù",

    "Ireland has ‚Äòstubbornly high gender pay gap‚Äô, says Ictu": "Ictu president Kevin Callinan during the launch of the union's toolkit relating to guidance for unions on closing the gender pay gap. Photograph: Gareth Chaney/Collins\n\nIreland has a ‚Äústubbornly high gender pay gap‚Äù, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (Ictu) has said.\n\nKevin Callinan, president of the Ictu, said Ireland‚Äôs gender pay gap stood at 11.3 per cent, according to the latest Eurostat data, as a new guide for trade unions on gender pay gap reporting was published in Dublin on Monday.\n\nUnder new legislation which came into force earlier this year, organisations with more than 250 employees are required to report their gender pay gap for 2022 in December, with the data based on a ‚Äúsnapshot‚Äù date of their choosing in June.\n\nThe legislation will be extended to organisations with 150 or more employees in 2024, and those with 50 or more employees in 2025.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nMr Callinan said the Ictu believed that gender pay gap reporting legislation was potentially a ‚Äúmechanism to encourage employers into tangible action to bridge the gap. It is also an opportunity for unions to negotiate actions to address pay inequality and we will be seeking engagement with employers when the first set of audit reports are published in December, in order to agree a set of measures to be taken by the employer to eliminate or reduce any gaps identified.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòUnequal pay‚Äô\n\nDr Jane Pillinger, consultant and author of the guide, said gender pay reporting was an important milestone in ‚Äúthe fight against unfair and unequal pay, particularly for women workers in low paid and undervalued jobs. Trade unions have a vital role to play in finding solutions with employers and bringing unequal pay and its root causes into collective bargaining. The guidance is aimed at building union strategies and actions on gender pay gap reporting and the wider structural causes of unequal pay.‚Äù\n\nMinister for Equality Roderic O‚ÄôGorman said the introduction of gender pay gap reporting in Ireland was a ‚Äúmajor step forward in terms of addressing gender inequality in the workplace. If a company doesn‚Äôt adhere to its obligations under the legislation, IREC, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has the power to bring those companies to court. That‚Äôs quite a sizable and important provision to make sure that there is adherence to this new law.‚Äù\n\nMr O‚ÄôGorman said it was hoped gender pay gap reporting would go ‚Äúa long way towards improving our understanding of the pay gap and incentivising employers to use whatever means they can to reduce that gap. With 65 per of all employees in the State estimated to fall within the scope of the act, the publication of gender pay gap information will provide a range of data about firms and sectors and how they contribute to the gender pay gap in the economy as a whole.‚Äù",
    "Data centre demands for gas connections 'could damage Ireland's emissions targets'": "Data centre operators are requesting connections to gas networks to fire their own generators because they cannot connect to the national electricity grid, prompting warnings about emissions and energy security.\n\nFigures seen by the Irish Examiner show that demand for gas connections from data centres has risen each year from 2019 to 2021, while the chairwoman of the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities (CRU) told an Oireachtas committee on Tuesday that Gas Networks Ireland (GNI) had flagged the issue because it could create higher than anticipated demand for gas.\n\nIreland has committed to reducing its natural gas consumption by 15% this winter as part of an EU-wide effort but a review of the Irish energy system published this week warns that since the National Development Plan was published, a large number of industrial and commercial premises have been connecting to gas pipelines.\n\nThe review, conducted by Cambridge Economic Policy Associates, states:\n\n‚ÄúGas Networks Ireland has told us that it has contracted with a significant number of I&C [industrial and commercial] gas connections, primarily related to the development and construction of data centres.\n\nCRU chairwoman, Aoife MacEvilly, told the Oireachtas environment committee that Gas Networks Ireland had flagged that the increase in connection requests could create a much higher demand profile. File picture\n\n‚ÄúHowever, we understand that most new data centre gas connections contracted by GNI are related to so-called ‚Äòislanded‚Äô data centres that require a direct gas connection for on-site power generation, with limited or no connection to the electricity grid. These new connections may lead to an increase in I&C gas demand above the levels assumed in our analysis.‚Äù\n\nA spokesperson for GNI said that for reasons of commercial confidentiality, it is unable to provide information on specific customers, or their energy use.\n\nOn Tuesday, Aoife MacEvilly of the CRU told the Oireachtas environment committee that there had been an increase in connection requests to gas networks for the purposes of running generators.\n\nRead More Energy expert calls for pause in building of data centres\n\n‚Äú[GNI] flagged to us that, from the time that we put in place the new connection policy on the electricity network, which would have precluded many new projects from signing up to the electricity network, it started seeing increased requests for data centre connections to the gas network on the basis that data centres would operate their own gas-fired generation on site.\n\n\"GNI flagged to us that this could create a much higher demand profile on the gas network.‚Äù\n\nSinn F√©in senator Lynn Boylan said the connections showed a lack of planning.\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lack of strategic planning that is damning for Fine Gael particularly.\n\nThis will make it so much harder to meet emissions targets. If those companies can‚Äôt access gas, the backup will be diesel, which is worse again.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of the Environment said that any centre not hooked up to the electricity grid could damage Irish emissions targets.\n\n\"The policy statement highlights the undesirability of 'islanded' data centres that would generate their own electricity from natural gas. The decarbonisation section of the Government Statement states:\n\n\"Islanded data centre developments, that are not connected to the electricity grid and are powered mainly by on-site fossil fuel generation, would not be in line with national policy.\n\n\"These would run counter to emissions reduction objectives and would not serve the wider efficiency and decarbonisation of our energy system. Growth in 'islanded‚Äô data centres could result in security of supply risk being transferred from electricity to gas supply, which would be a significant challenge given Ireland‚Äôs reliance on gas importation.‚Äù",

    "Tony Blair ‚Äòhelping‚Äô in UK‚Äôs Northern Ireland protocol row with EU": "NEW YORK ‚Äî Tony Blair has been ‚Äúexplaining‚Äù the U.K.'s position on the controversial post-Brexit Northern Ireland protocol to skeptical foreign allies, according to a senior British diplomat.\n\nAmid a bitter ongoing dispute with the EU, it was revealed earlier this month that the former British prime minister ‚Äî who won three elections as Labour leader and was a vocal champion of the U.K. staying in the European Union ‚Äî has been providing ‚Äúassistance‚Äù alongside former Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern.\n\nFurther detailing that work on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York this week, the U.K. diplomat said: \"Tony has certainly been explaining to the Europeans and the Americans that the British government has a real point on the trading aspects of the Northern Ireland protocol.\"\n\nThe U.K. has been locked in months of wrangling with Brussels over the protocol, which imposes post-Brexit checks on British goods entering Northern Ireland.\n\nLondon argues that the setup is overly bureaucratic, and cites the deep opposition it has faced from unionist politicians in the region. It's devised domestic legislation that would let ministers ignore parts of the protocol, triggering anger in Brussels and Dublin.\n\nThe EU counters that the U.K. signed up to the painstakingly-negotiated arrangement and, while it's proposed a series of changes to the way the protocol works in practice, sees it as the only way to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland while also protecting the bloc's single market.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden ‚Äî whose administration has made clear it wants the U.K. to keep talking to the EU to find a solution ‚Äî raised the protocol Wednesday in a meeting with British Prime Minister Liz Truss at the U.N. General Assembly.\n\nDowning Street consistently stresses it is at one with the White House on the need to protect the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement, the historic 1998 Northern Ireland peace accord. But British officials argue that the U.S. side does not always recognize this as a separate entity from the Northern Ireland protocol.\n\nBoth Biden and Truss stressed their joint desire to protect the agreement as they posed for cameras before their meeting, with the U.S. president telling Truss: \"We are both committed to protecting the Good Friday Agreement of Northern Ireland. And I‚Äôm looking forward to hearing what‚Äôs on your mind.\"\n\nThe same U.K. diplomat argued that Blair, as a key player in the Northern Ireland peace process, was well-placed to explain ‚Äúwhy there's no danger, why it's not about the Good Friday Agreement.\"\n\nAnd they added: \"He‚Äôs explaining why the EU's proposals will not work. He doesn't agree with the government on every point, but he certainly has been a helpful voice in that and I'm sure he will go on being so.‚Äù\n\nBlair's office declined to comment.\n\nWhile the British side continues to repeat the mantra that it wants a negotiated solution to the row as soon as possible, there are signs it may be bracing for the long haul, after last week vowing to keep waiving checks required under the protocol, which it has repeatedly postponed.\n\nWith the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement looming in 2023, the diplomat said of Biden: ‚ÄúIf you look at the calendar, you will conclude that next year there might be an obvious reason to visit Europe if things come good.‚Äù U.K. officials said they expected the 25th anniversary ‚Äî which is still more than six months away ‚Äî to act as a ‚Äúkey decision point‚Äù on the protocol.\n\nA Downing Street spokesperson said after the Biden and Truss meeting that the pair agreed ‚Äúthe priority must be protecting the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement and preserving the gains of peace in Northern Ireland,\" while a statement from the U.S. said the two leaders had \"affirmed their shared commitment to protecting the gains of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement.\"\n\nDowning Street said Ukraine had dominated discussions while the protocol had only featured as a short segment.",
    "All-Ireland semi 'doesn't come up' between Oz teammates": "It's only 13 months since Vikki Wall and Erika O'Shea clashed in an All-Ireland semi-final for the ages, Wall and Meath memorably coming out on top.\n\nNow the Meath and Cork duo share the same AFLW dream as North Melbourne teammates and are even housemates.\n\n\"That doesn't come up too much,\" smiled back-to-back All-Ireland winner Wall of the 2021 semi-final which Meath eventually won after extra-time. \"A few of the girls out here were questioning whether we'd played together or against each other back home so there were a few brief conversations about that within the North Melbourne setup alright! But no, we haven't talked about it too much.\"\n\nSo far in season seven of the oval ball game, the Irish pair have played all five matches for their club, winning three and losing two. The losses were to Melbourne and Adelaide, both of whom featured in last season's grand final, and there are five regular round games to go. The Kangaroos are currently seventh in the table. A top eight finish in late October will yield qualification for the knock-out stages.\n\nWhatever about reigning Player of the Year Wall adapting quickly to the game, O'Shea's development is even more impressive having just turned 20.\n\n\"From a personal perspective I'm glad I waited until I'm this age,\" said Wall. \"I'm 24 now so I'm probably at a stage where I feel more confident coming over here. I don't know how I would have fared at a younger age. Erika is taking it in her stride and it's great to see. I think it's a big move no matter what age you are so it definitely takes a bit of time to adjust.\"\n\nWhen, or even if, either of them will play for their counties again remains to be seen.\n\nBoth were All-Stars in 2021 and while O'Shea missed Cork's 2022 campaign, the likelihood is that Wall will be honoured again after another excellent season.\n\nMeath, currently without a management team, would love to have her back for the defence of their National League and All-Ireland titles in 2023. That seems unlikely though with all the indicators that the AFLW season will start again in late summer.\n\n\"No plans at the moment,\" said Wall of 2023. \"It's a bit of a waiting game which, in some ways, is kind of maybe prolonging it and things like that but in other ways it's nice to forget about it for a little while and just give my full devotion to what I'm doing at the moment. It (next year's AFLW season) will be a similar timeframe. It could be May it will start in, as in pre-season, if they introduce more games so we'll see.\"\n\nWall was happy to hear that former President Mary McAleese will chair an integration process between the GAA, Camogie and LGFA organisations.\n\n\"When you have someone with such experience as Mary McAleese, I don't think you're ever not going to be going in the right direction. It's all definitely on an upward trajectory. It's a really exciting time for the game back home to see that progress being made.\"\n\n* Vikki Wall was speaking at the launch of the next phase of the National Dairy Council's 'From the Ground Up' campaign. The campaign highlights the hard work and commitment shared by top athletes and dairy farmers and includes a new TV and cinema campaign.",

Since monetary policy is carried out by the European Central Bank (ECB) for the entire EA, macroprudential policy has the potential to play a critical stabilizing role for the Irish financial system.",
    "Queen Elizabeth remembered in Ireland for historic reconciliation": "Expressions of sympathy in Ireland demonstrate how Queen Elizabeth II achieved healing in the fraught history of Ireland and Britain.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II reigned for more than 70 years and for 30 years during that time a vicious conflict was fought in the part of her United Kingdom known as Northern Ireland.\n\nAbout 3,600 people were killed and more than 30,000 wounded from 1969 until the signing of an agreement in 1998, which largely brought peace between those fighting against British rule in the northern province of Ireland, and those battling to preserve and defend the union with Britain.\n\nThe fighting, euphemistically known as ‚Äúthe Troubles‚Äù, was brutal, bitter, and sectarian.\n\nBritish troops, the Northern Irish security services, Irish Republican Army (IRA) fighters, and pro-British Loyalist armed groups bombed and shot, killed and maimed, as they turned city streets and rural towns into guerrilla-war battlefields.\n\nFor generations of Irish nationalists and republicans, the British Crown and its forces were an enemy responsible for the degradation of centuries of colonial rule in Ireland.\n\nYet, on Thursday, two Irish soldiers lowered Ireland‚Äôs tricolour flag to half-staff at a government building in Dublin to mark the queen‚Äôs death. Irish embassies around the world also followed suit and lowered the republic‚Äôs flag as a mark of respect.\n\nThe Irish flag has been lowered to half mast at Government Buildings this evening to mark the death of HM Queen Elizabeth.

Three other relatives of Mountbatten died in the attack.\n\nThirty years of bloodshed between Irish nationalists, pro-British loyalists, and the British military in British-run Northern Ireland was largely ended by the 1998 peace deal that was brokered by Irish and British leaders.\n\nBut it was the queen‚Äôs visit 13 years after the signing of the peace agreement that provided a degree of personal, historic healing.\n\nWriting in Britain‚Äôs Guardian newspaper shortly after the Queen‚Äôs visit, Irish columnist Fintan O‚ÄôToole summed up a feeling likely experienced by many Irish people.\n\n‚ÄúThere are, presumably, two rules the Queen has absorbed so deeply that they have become instinctive: don‚Äôt take risks; don‚Äôt stir emotions,‚Äù O‚ÄôToole wrote.\n\n‚ÄúShe broke both rules in Ireland last week,‚Äù he wrote.\n\n‚ÄúTo the great surprise of those of us who have little time for monarchy, she walked that line with amazing grace. It is not simply that she didn‚Äôt put a foot wrong. It is that every step seemed exactly right.‚Äù"
