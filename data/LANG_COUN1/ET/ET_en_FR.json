    "France announces €45bn effort to shield country from energy cost increases": "The French government plans to spend €45bn shielding households and businesses from energy price shocks in a budget focused on bringing down inflation.\n\nThe finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said the increase in the cost of gas and electricity would be capped at 15% from January. Gas and electricity price rises are currently capped at 4% until the end of the year in what is known as the bouclier tarifaire (tariff shield).\n\nOutlining key elements of his 2023 budget bill on Monday, Le Maire said it was financed “down to the last euro” and the government’s No 1 priority was fighting inflation at a time of unprecedented uncertainty due to Russia’s war against Ukraine.\n\n“The most important and the most urgent challenge for France and other European nations is to bring down the inflation pressure,” the minister told journalists on Monday. “We don’t want to increase taxes and we want to protect households,” he added.\n\nSpecial levies on energy companies were expected to reduce the net cost to the country of the price cap from €45bn to €12bn. Le Maire said €3bn would be set aside to help French companies threatened by soaring energy prices particularly those “exposed to international competition”.\n\nThe French state is the majority shareholder in EDF, the country’s largest electricity supplier – it is engaged in taking full control of the company – and has a majority shareholding in Engie (formerly Gaz de France).\n\nIn an interview with Le Journal du Dimanche, the public accounts minister, Gabriel Attal, said the fuel price cap would “block the rise in gas and electricity bills at 15% instead of 120%”. Without this year’s 4% price cap, based on prices in November 2021 – three months before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – the ministry estimated French bills would have risen 60% for gas and 45% for electricity.\n\n“The budget we are presenting is [a] budget to protect,” Attal said.\n\nIncome tax bands were also being increased next year by 5% to partially mitigate the effects of inflation, meaning someone earning €2,000 a month would be €200 better off, Attal added. The top tax bracket for anyone earning more than €169,000 will remain at 45%.\n\nLe Maire also announced pay increases for teachers as well as 10,000 new civil service jobs, including 2,000 new teachers, and the financing of 6,000 homes for refugees and asylum seekers.\n\nHe said inflation was expected to remain at about 6% in the coming months before dropping to 4% in 2023. The government’s second priority was to maintain public spending to within 5% of the country’s output with the aim of reducing it to the EU’s limit of 3% of GDP by 2027, and to reduce the public debt – expected to rise to a record €270bn next year – from 2026, Le Maire added.\n\nEconomic forecasts from earlier this month suggest growth in France’s economy will drop to 1% next year from 2.7% this year. However, the high council for public finance, an independent body, has said the government’s growth forecasts are optimistic.\n\nThe government must push the budget through a fractious parliament having lost its majority in the Assemblée Nationale in legislative elections before the summer.",

    "Fresh accusations of violence against women divide France’s left": "Julien Bayou is no longer co-president of the green group in France's National Assembly or national secretary of the Green party | Geoffroy Van Der Hasselt/AFP via Getty Images\n\nAnother head has rolled on the French left. Julien Bayou is no longer co-president of the green group in France’s National Assembly or national secretary of the Green party, where he’s been an important figure since 2013, after being accused of psychological abuse against his former partner.\n\nThe Green party — Europe Écologie les Verts (EELV) — is torn over the affair, which comes right after a rift formed within the broader left-wing alliance — led by far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon’s France Unbowed — over another controversy surrounding violence against women.\n\nMélenchon’s success in June’s parliamentary elections robbed French President Emmanuel Macron of his majority in the National Assembly, giving the left-winger and his party unprecedented political influence. But accusations targeting two of his party’s heavyweights in parliament have cast doubt over the management of gender issues within France Unbowed, a party with a strong feminist stance.\n\nBayou’s case is now adding to the left’s troubles.\n\nIn July, Le Figaro reported that Bayou’s ex-girlfriend had filed a complaint to the Greens’ internal team which deals with violence against women, after what he called a “painful and difficult breakup.” His job only appeared to be on the line, however, after Sandrine Rousseau, a fellow Green and influential MP, re-upped the matter on France 5 last week.\n\nRousseau suggested Bayou had exhibited “behavior which could break women’s psychological health” and said that Bayou’s former partner had later attempted suicide. The party subsequently suspended Bayou from his role as co-president of the group, and he has now stepped down as secretary as well.\n\nIn a statement criticizing the manner of his ouster, he said, “I’m accused of facts which haven’t been laid out, which my accusers say are not punishable by law … It’s Kafka in the time of social media.”\n\nTalking to Paris Playbook, someone in the party’s administration, speaking anonymously, questioned the manner in which Rousseau targeted Bayou on a TV panel, asking, “Was it necessary to lay the topic out on the table like that?”\n\nSome Bayou supporters suspect a political maneuver from Rousseau, who opposes Bayou’s favored candidate to succeed him in December’s election for the party presidency.\n\nOne Rousseau supporter rejected this in no uncertain terms, saying: “Julien is a little ectoplasmic puddle who nobody gives a shit about. Sandrine is doing this to fight the patriarchy, which for her is more important than anything.”\n\nMélenchon under fire\n\nMeanwhile, Mélenchon caused uproar in his own ranks after clumsily commenting on another case involving one of his own lawmakers.\n\nMP Adrien Quatennens, one of his closest allies in parliament, resigned as France Unbowed’s operations manager earlier this month after admitting he had slapped his wife, Céline Quatennens — the pair are currently in divorce proceedings. French media reported that Céline Quatennens does not intend to press charges.\n\nDirectly after Quatennens’ resignation, Mélenchon tweeted his “trust and affection” for the MP and criticized “media voyeurism,” before explaining, “my affection for him doesn’t mean that I’m indifferent to Céline.” On Thursday, he doubled down on the tweets, saying he “always weighs [his] words” before, bizarrely, stroking a journalist’s face.\n\nWhile rival parties made predictably severe criticism, seizing upon the opportunity to score points against a party that’s made preventing violence against women a key policy focus, several figures from Mélenchon’s own party also spoke out.\n\nMEP Manon Aubry and MP Clémentine Autain said that Mélenchon’s tweets did not speak for them, while another MP released a statement alluding to “some tweets [which] betray a belittling of the facts committed and a misunderstanding of the reality of domestic violence.”\n\nAutain and Rousseau are two of France’s highest-profile feminist figures, and are leading voices when it comes to condemning violence against women. Rousseau was elected MP for the first time in June; in 2016, she made headlines for accusing Green party colleague and MP Denis Baupin of sexual harassment, kicking off a long legal saga.\n\nMélenchon had to make amends over the weekend, saying said he “accepted” the criticism and condemnation of him on a France 2 talk show.",
    "A local’s guide to Arcachon: France’s Atlantic coast gem": "Food\n\nEveryone in Arcachon is proud of our magnificent covered food hall, an example of the Baltard style of architecture found in markets all over France, which was restored to its former glory 10 years ago.\n\nI’ve run my own oyster bar there for 22 years. Les Halles really comes alive at the weekend: locals stop by for an apéro, I prepare seafood platters and sometimes we offer our great local produce, Aquitaine caviar, made by two artisan producers. Tourists often stop in the market pulling their suitcases as it is en route from the train station to the port where ferries shuttle over to Cap Ferret.\n\nFor a great plat du jour lunch, Le Bouchon de Marché’s owner, Fleur, grills a juicy entrecôte steak or a tender blanquette de veau stew. A couple of roads back from the beach, Pizzeria Jehenne is great for families – chef Danny has been making pizzas and pasta for 45 years, and visitors never realise he’s not Italian but a local Arcachonnais.\n\nStéphanie Aloire, one of our few female ostréiculturists, has a traditional wooden oyster hut, La Cabane de l’Aiguillon, a magical location right on the water near the port. Head there to taste her award-winning oysters and whelks, winkles and shrimps. And in summer, the seasonal Le Club Plage Perreire is perfect for a romantic meal on the beach; grilled, freshly caught fish.\n\nInspiration\n\nI spend a great part of my life out on the water as I have been farming oysters in Arcachon since 1988. If you ask where I go to find inspiration, I’ll still say out on the Bassin d’Arcachon, but on a sailing boat rather than my work motorboat.\n\nSomehow the oyster parks and the views of Cap Ferret are different when the wind gusts into my sails. Visitors can hire a boat and skipper to try this, but my favourite spot, the strip of sand known as Le Conche du Mimbeau, is also accessible on foot at low tide. Time your trip well and you have the perfect view across to our iconic Dune du Pilat.\n\nBeautiful sunsets can be enjoyed from Arcachon’s Plage du Moulleau. Photograph: Andia/Alamy\n\nNeighbourhood\n\nArcachon is neatly divided into four quarters, named after the seasons, and the neighbourhood that means most to me is the Ville d’Hiver, the Winter Town. This is the grandest, most beautiful part of town, with splendid 19th-century belle-\n\népoque villas that date back to when people from across Europe came here to treat tuberculosis with healing breezes from the sea and pine forests. So it has always been a peaceful, quiet area and I love this contrast to the busy commercial streets of Ville d’Eté, the Summer Town.\n\nThe Ville d’Hiver is the greenest quarter, with lush vegetation that reminds me of a botanical garden, and my favourite place is the 1884 Hôtel Ville d’Hiver, an early industrial building converted into a cosy hotel. Its bistrot is perfect for a romantic dinner.\n\nGreen Space\n\nÎle aux Oiseaux. Photograph: Philippe Turpin/Getty Images\n\nWe are lucky for a small town to have beautifully landscaped gardens, the Parc Mauresque. This was where the opulent casino once stood, and now the park is perfect for picnics. North of the town, in Arcachon Bay, the Île aux Oiseaux is a timeless, perfectly preserved natural environment, home to 150 bird species, but it must be respected.\n\nOrganised excursions round the island are a good first step but you are not allowed to land. Although you can hire a boat and sail over I advise against this as you need experience to navigate the bay. It’s best to hire a boat with a skipper and then you can explore at leisure, discovering the Cabanes Tchanquées, the island’s iconic stilt fishing huts.\n\nNightlife\n\nQuartier du Moulleau. Photograph: Andia/Alamy\n\nThe Quartier du Moulleau, is actually one long street lined with bars; you can drink late at L’Oublie, run by a former rugby player, and Club Paradiso, then carry on at the adjoining Pyla-sur-Mer, where Le Bal à Papa, known as Le Balap, is an institution where all ages dance until 2am to the music of Doudou, our legendary Guadeloupean DJ. Those looking for craft beers should check out Brasserie Mira, a brewery that also hosts artists and musicians.\n\nStay\n\nA comfortable place worth checking out is Hôtel Home (doubles from €130 room-only), right by the beach.\n\nOlivier Laban is a renowned Arcachon oyster farmer who organises seafood tastings at his lively Oyster Bar",

    "Putin is mobilizing. Germany and France are unlikely to step up": "John R. Deni is a research professor at the U.S. Army War College’s Strategic Studies Institute and a non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. He’s the author of “Coalition of the unWilling and unAble.”\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin’s recent decision to partially mobilize Russian reservists represents a significant escalation in his war against Ukraine.\n\nOver the coming weeks and months, this could inject as many as 300,000 additional Russian troops into the Kremlin’s war effort — and just as Ukraine has achieved some battlefield success. Increased Western assistance is now vital for Kyiv to leverage and expand its gains and build up defensive positions, before additional Russian forces enter the fight. But not all Western powers have been pulling their weight in this regard — especially Paris and Berlin.\n\nThe Franco-German engine has powered the European Union for over 70 years. Today, however, that engine has stalled in the face of the greatest challenge confronting European security since the end of World War II. The Continent’s most powerful economy and its most powerful military are failing to meet the moment. And, unfortunately, odds that either will change course within the timeframe necessary to help Kyiv achieve its objectives are low.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, top political leaders in both France and Germany appeared to recognize the scale of the crisis. French President Emmanuel Macron immediately highlighted the damage Russia had done to European peace and stability, noting that in its response, the West would “be without weakness” in the military, economic, and energy domains. Meanwhile, new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz declared Putin had destroyed the European security architecture, arguing that the Russian invasion had marked a turning point, and it was now time to support Ukraine to “the best of our ability.”\n\nSince those early days, though, the actions of Europe’s political dynamic duo have failed to match their own rhetoric. Germany has been dragging its feet on sending the kinds of military equipment other allies have been providing Ukraine for months. After promising to deliver multiple launch rocket systems, self-propelled howitzers and air defense systems, the glacial pace of delivery has cast doubt on Berlin’s commitment. Moreover, Germany’s sheer unwillingness to send heavy armored forces — like tanks and infantry fighting vehicles — has prompted criticism from Ukrainian leaders, who accuse Berlin of backtracking.\n\nMeanwhile, France has been willfully curtailing its assistance in hopes of playing the role of neutral arbiter when the shooting stops. Macron irreparably damaged his claim to European leadership when he called on Ukraine to avoid humiliating Putin, and from an operational perspective, while the country has provided offensive weapons to Ukraine, it has reportedly sent less than even Germany, and trained an extraordinarily small number of Ukrainian troops compared to others like the United Kingdom.\n\nClearly, these leading European countries have both failed to rise to the occasion — but for two very different reasons.\n\nFor over a half century, Germany has pursued a cooperative change-through-trade approach to Russia. Now, having finally woken up to Moscow’s zero-sum approach — and its corresponding disdain for cooperation with the West — Berlin is attempting to reverse its long-standing strategy. But change is never easy, especially in Germany, so the effort to overcome entrenched, conventional national security wisdom goes two steps forward, one step back.\n\nFor France, however, the dynamic in question isn’t change but the opposite — status quo.\n\nResidual illusions of French grandeur lie at the heart of Macron’s efforts to walk an elusive middle ground between the West and Russia. Across much of the Continent, France’s leading role in pursing European “strategic autonomy” in recent years has been seen as a thinly veiled attempt to resuscitate French greatness and promote the country’s own interests. However, in trying to position France as a practically minded, neutral arbiter between Ukraine and Russia, Macron has instead undermined Paris’s reputation as a defender of Western values and interests.\n\nUnfortunately, as this French pursuit of greatness continues to endure and 50 years of German foreign policy won’t be changed overnight, neither of these European powers is likely to play a leading role in helping Ukraine in the short run. This is particularly problematic at the moment, as Kyiv is eager to keep up the momentum after the serious battlefield success realized by its forces.\n\nAlthough the news from the Kharkiv region of northeastern Ukraine has been remarkably positive for Kyiv in recent days, there are still many reasons to think Russia is far from being knocked out of the conflict.\n\nFor one thing, Ukraine’s progress in the south — where it had begun shifting resources from Kharkiv — remains slow and arduous. Additionally, Moscow retains the ability to conduct precision long-range strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure. Most importantly, though, Russia still holds both qualitative and quantitative military advantages over Ukraine in terms of both manpower and equipment.\n\nFor all these reasons — especially given Putin’s partial mobilization — the war will most likely continue to unfold over the coming months, if not years. Ukraine is unlikely to remain in the fight without significant long-term Western aid, precision weaponry in particular, which they have already been using to good effect, targeting Russian supply lines and logistics. But they will need more — particularly if outmatched in troop numbers later this year.\n\nThe United States, the U.K., Poland, and other allies are all currently providing substantial training, equipment, expertise and intelligence. And in response to Putin’s mobilization, both France and Germany have an opportunity to do so as well — but whether and when they will fulfill their potential remains to be seen.",

    "France Dealing with Influx of Cocaine from Caribbean Territories": "A series of cocaine seizures in the French Caribbean territories of French Guiana, Guadeloupe, and Martinique has revealed how these territories provide another popular option for trafficking cocaine into Europe.\n\n\n\nOn September 22, authorities in French Guiana revealed that an ongoing legal experiment, where people caught carrying less than 1.5 kilograms of cocaine would not face criminal charges, would not be extended past the end of September. Such small-time seizures have become very frequent, especially on flights between French Guiana and mainland France.\n\n\n\nFrench Guiana remains a popular departure point for cocaine due to its direct flight connections to France. Arrests in recent years have shown how the air link between Cayenne, the capital of French Guiana, and Paris Orly’s airport is a particular concern.\n\nIn February, French customs revealed that cocaine seizures at Parisian airports in 2021 were up 64 percent over 2019, despite a sharp drop in passenger numbers during the COVID-19 pandemic. French Guiana was the main origin point for cocaine seizures.\n\nSEE ALSO: Dutch Ship Makes Waves with Record Cocaine Seizures in Caribbean\n\nThe government is more concerned about the continued capture of much larger cargo. The latest such seizure came after a French coast guard vessel inspected a sailboat off the coast of Martinique on September 10 and found over 1.3 tons of cocaine on board. This marked the seventh such seizure so far this year, according to a government press release.\n\nSailboats appear to be a favored modus operandi through the French islands as another yacht was caught off Guadeloupe in July carrying over 445 kilograms of cocaine.\n\nThis has all contributed to an explosion of cocaine found coming into France this year. From January to July 2022, cocaine seizures by French customs were up 94 percent over the same period in 2021, Gabriel Attal, France’s Minister of Public Action and Accounts, told the press in September.\n\nInSight Crime Analysis\n\nWhile the Caribbean has proven a popular route for drug traffickers to send drugs from Colombia and Venezuela north to Central America, Mexico, and the United States, much of the cocaine going through French Guiana, Guadeloupe, and Martinique is Europe-bound.\n\nIn May, a flight between Cayenne and Paris was chosen at random for an anti-narcotics sweep in French Guiana, according to a report by French media group RTL. Passengers on the flight were notified ahead of time they needed to show up at the airport ahead of time for this control. After receiving this message, 38 passengers rapidly cancelled their tickets, several were denied boarding due to suspicious behavior, and five were arrested after small quantities of cocaine were found in their luggage.\n\nBesides the well-documented Cayenne-Orly route, the islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique are not spared from trafficking events. In June, the daughter of a former French minister and her husband were put on trial for allegedly importing cocaine from Martinique to the mainland.\n\nAnd there is suspicion European criminal groups outside France may be getting involved. In July 2021, two Bulgarian citizens were caught on a yacht east of Martinique with a plentiful supply of cocaine. The men tried to burn their shipment but authorities retrieved over 300 kilograms of cocaine from the wreckage.\n\nFurthermore, France’s anti-narcotics office (Office anti-stupéfiants - Ofast) has warned about traffickers swapping cocaine for cannabis resin.\n\n“Traffickers arrive in the Antilles with 1, 10, or 100 kilograms of cannabis resin and leave with 1, 10, or 100 kilograms of cocaine. Trafficking is on the rise due to its availability and its cheap cost,” said Ofast’s director for the Caribbean, Christian Nussbaum, in a 2020 interview for Radio France Internationale.",

    "France’s energy bill to exceed €100 billion this year": "France’s fossil fuel import bill is expected double from 2021, reaching €100 billion as energy bills skyrocket across Europe, the French Nuclear Energy Society (SFEN) told a Parliamentary hearing on Wednesday.\n\nThe French Treasury revealed in April that the French energy bill had reached a record high, rising from €27 billion in the second half of 2021 to €48 billion in the first half of 2022. In light of current price data, “we will end the year with an energy bill of over €100 billion,” SFEN Director General Valérie Faudon told the hearing Committee.\n\nThe bill was at €44.3 billion in 2021, over double the €19.1 billion in 2020, according to the latest figures from the ecological transition ministry.\n\nThe rise in costs can be explained by the difference between energy supply and demand following the COVID-19 crisis, which has led to rising fossil fuel prices and import volumes.\n\nMore specifically, import bills for oil, refined products, and biofuels have risen sharply. The bill for natural gas has almost tripled, from €5.2 billion in 2020 to €13.3 billion in 2021.\n\nAt the same time, coal imports increased only slightly, while a positive electricity export balance reduced the bill by €2.6 billion, compared to €1.2 billion in 2020.\n\nFrance’s saving grace: nuclear energy\n\nThe situation is similar, if not worse, in other European countries. Germany’s energy mix is 78% fossil fuel, compared to France’s 46%. France is also less dependent on Russian gas than its European partners, accounting for only 20% of its energy imports, compared to 38% in the EU.\n\nAccording to a restrictive approach based on the cross-sectional data acquired, the German bill is likely to exceed 120 billion euros by the end of this year.\n\nThat said, French and EU dependency on Russian gas has been steadily increasing over the past three years, with a 13% and 20% rise in 2019, respectively.\n\nHowever, France can count on nuclear energy more than many of its neighbours. It remains affordable enough not to become a strategic concern and represents less than €1 billion for the year, Faudon explained.\n\nAccording to the ecological transition ministry, nuclear energy accounted for 40% of all primary electricity consumption.\n\n“We can see the effects of a good energy mix compared to a dependence on fossil fuels,” Faudon noted.\n\nIn spite of nuclear, France is a net importer of electricity\n\nIn 2022 however, France will remain a net electricity importer. The low availability of nuclear energy due to delayed maintenance on nuclear plants and the limited hydro-produced electricity due to summer droughts have pushed electricity costs extensively – alongside a hike in imported fossil fuels prices and volumes.\n\nAccording to the French national statistics body INSEE, the €100 billion bill should represent between 4% and 4.5% of France’s 2022 gross domestic product.\n\nThis situation has consequently led to a sharp deterioration in the French trade balance, from a €51 billion deficit in the second half of 2021 to a €71 billion deficit for the second part of 2022.\n\n[Edited by Théo Bourgery-Gonse]\n\n(Paul Messad | EURACTIV.fr)",
    "Mbappe and Giroud shine as France shrug off troubles to outclass Austria": "Kylian Mbappe scored a stunning opening goal as France shook off injuries to a host of key players and a series of off-field issues to claim a welcome 2-0 win over Austria in the UEFA Nations League in Paris on Thursday.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nMbappe showcased his phenomenal pace and strength on the way before finishing emphatically to put the reigning world champions ahead in the 56th minute at the Stade de France.\n\nThe recalled Olivier Giroud doubled their lead nine minutes later as France ran out deserved winners to stave off the threat of relegation from the top tier of the Nations League, a competition they won just last year.\n\nDidier Deschamps' side still need to win their last Group A1 game away in Denmark on Sunday to be certain of avoiding relegation, while qualification for the four-team finals next June is already out of reach.\n\nFrance's failure to win any of their four games in June is the reason for that, but the priority for Les Bleus now is the World Cup, with the first game of their title defence in Qatar exactly two months away.\n\nDeschamps will hope to have recovered at least the majority of his crocked stars by the time that match against Australia comes around on November 22.\n\nThose missing from this game would make up a very strong team in their own right, with the absentees including goalkeeper and captain Hugo Lloris; centre-backs Lucas Hernandez and Presnel Kimpembe; left-back Theo Hernandez; midfield lynchpin N'Golo Kante and forward Kingsley Coman.\n\nKarim Benzema is currently out too, and then there is Paul Pogba, who faces a race against time to recover from knee surgery.\n\nPogba has also been in the headlines after filing a complaint with Italian prosecutors saying he was the target of a 13 million-euro ($13m) blackmail plot.\n\nHis brother Mathias is one of five people charged and detained in the case.\n\nGiroud closes on goals record\n\nMeanwhile this week began with Paris Saint-Germain superstar Mbappe refusing to take part in a photo shoot in a row with the French Football Federation over image rights.\n\nBut neither Mbappe nor his teammates appeared distracted as they outclassed Austria.\n\nMbappe had the ball in the net inside 90 seconds only to be denied by the offside flag, and he was a constant threat in the first half.\n\nFrance should have led at the interval but Austria had goalkeeper Patrick Pentz to thank for a sensational double save in the 35th minute.\n\nPentz tipped Aurelien Tchouameni's acrobatic overhead kick onto the bar and then got down low to save Antoine Griezmann's follow-up attempt.\n\nBefore that the hosts -- who gave debuts to Monaco centre-back Benoit Badiashile and his club colleague, midfielder Youssouf Fofana -- saw their injury worries increase when Barcelona's Jules Kounde limped out.\n\nGoalkeeper Mike Maignan also came off at half-time to be replaced by West Ham United's Alphonse Areola, and France went ahead soon after.\n\nMbappe collected a Giroud pass on the left before surging inside, bouncing off Austria's Marcel Sabitzer, and lashing a shot beyond Pentz.\n\nHe celebrated by mimicking a photographer, an apparent nod to the troublesome quarrel over image rights.\n\nGiroud then marked his return to the side by heading in Griezmann's cross to make it 2-0 with his 49th international goal.\n\nHe is now just two shy of Thierry Henry's French record of 51.\n\n(AFP)\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe",

    "Türkiye-France relations: Resetting entente for stability, peace": "Historically, Turkish-French relations have evolved into a cordial detente, but in the aftermath of the arrival of the Justice and Development Party (AK Party) to power in 2002, this dynamic shifted to one of conflict. The new foreign policy established by the AK Party leadership focused on fulfilling the regional and international prestige of Türkiye and thus challenged the intellectual and social concepts of the Turkish-French relationship.\n\nThis new direction of the AK Party was built on an abstract narrative that neither local nor international politics could swallow. The leaders in Ankara, under the direction of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, have changed the trajectory of Turkish foreign relations based on a rebalancing strategy of the country regionally in the Middle East, on one hand, and in the European/Western sphere on the other.\n\nThis political paradigm is jumped on by Western Europe, and by French leaders and political elites, who use it to argue that Türkiye does not belong to Europe. The “cliche” of the French elite, media, political and military leaders who see today's Türkiye as a rising “imperial” religious rival state has done a lot of damage to relations between the two countries lately.\n\nGeopolitical competitiveness\n\nGeopolitical competitiveness has begun to strain the two countries' relations. Disagreements arose decades ago over the question of Türkiye's full integration into the European Union. Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy did vehemently oppose Türkiye’s full accession, saying this great Muslim country is “not European!” The same sentiment was expressed four decades ago by then President Valery Giscard d’Estaing.\n\nConsequently, a large majority of Turks, elite and politicians alike, did understand what was going on: The question is not about geography, it is all about religion.\n\nSarkozy did offer, instead, a “privileged partnership” to preserve the strategic relations between the two countries. Incumbent President Emmanuel Macron is following in the footsteps of his predecessors as he fully assumes his opposition to Türkiye’s EU integration. Macron, however, did suggest the creation of a European Political Community proposal last May in Strasbourg at the European Parliament as the lawmakers debated Ukraine’s ambition to become an EU candidate. It was not to replace EU policies and instruments, but rather to establish regular meetings on key topics to stabilize the European continent, President Macron said during his Moldova trip.\n\nHe did not mention Türkiye, who might join this European club – a sort of second-division league. Ankara is a longtime EU aspirant that sits alongside many other European countries in NATO, but Macron has insisted the forum would only be for countries that share the EU’s “democratic values.”\n\nIn this contentious relationship between the two countries, a rhetorical style from Macron directed at Erdoğan is on the rise and further impacting relations.\n\nMacron did set the bar high. He is competing with Erdoğan in light of the ongoing war in Ukraine and is desperate to have a cordial call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whereas Erdoğan positioned himself as a credible and trustworthy mediator in the Ukraine war in the early days of the conflict.\n\nThis July, Türkiye played a major role alongside United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, as Russia and Ukraine sealed a grain deal in Istanbul to unblock Ukraine's Black Sea exports after a Russian blockade raised fears of a global food crisis.\n\nErdoğan keeps challenging Macron’s policies vis-a-vis the Muslim community in France. Macron and his interior minister lately have been taking bold decisions in this regard in the name of French sacrosanct laicism principles.\n\nIn a joint press conference with his French counterpart in Ankara on Sept. 5, Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu highlighted the problems of the Turkish and Muslim community in France and the delays in issuing visas to Turkish citizens. The minister also emphasized the fact that the diverging opinions of the two countries should not be a hurdle in working together.\n\nCommon interests\n\nThere are other questions on which the Turkish and French leaders could not agree that came to the fore. For example, the Armenian diaspora in France's activism for the recognition of the genocide, especially after Macron established a day of commemoration. The Kurdish question is another example, one that Paris views through the lens of its “moral” support for minorities, while Ankara sees it as a serious issue of internal security and national territorial integrity.\n\nHowever, there are common elements that enhance their relations, such as their role as two strong regional stabilizing powers in the Mediterranean. Also in their global fight against supranational terrorist groups, both countries look at their national security imperatives as connected to the Syrian civil war. When it comes to Libya, France appears lost due to the complex dynamics of the conflicts, leaving Paris in panic mode and ineffectual. However, the two countries could serve as strong voices to end the Libyan civil war crisis. Finally, there is the thorny issue of migrants and how Ankara could play a major role to stop the influx of hundreds of thousands of migrants to Europe.\n\nThe defeated July 15, 2016 coup attempt in Türkiye had accelerated the loss of Turkish trust in France, the Europeans and the West in general. Another point of discord between Ankara and Paris is the rising role of Türkiye in Africa, a region that Paris still sees as its protected backyard. Ankara’s active foreign policy in Africa aligns with the rise of anti-French sentiment in the African Sahel and in Maghreb countries like Algeria. Meanwhile, Paris has been showing its concerns about the latest Algeria-Türkiye strategic rapprochement.\n\nA rapprochement that further pushes Ankara to place its pawns in the Mediterranean and the African continent. Another strategy that Paris is leaning toward is the new MedEast axis: Greece-Cyprus and Egypt-Israel.\n\nThis competition for power paradoxically highlights the complementary roles of the two countries that would act more effectively as partners, rather than adversaries. The power of Turkish diplomacy is real. Ankara has proven itself in the international political arena via its humanitarian diplomatic paradigm and strong understanding of 21st-century world affairs. These doctrines are shaping the entirety of Türkiye’s foreign policy principles and objectives, both regionally and internationally.\n\nBayraktar TB2\n\nAdding to this are the rapid growth and developments of the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK), an influence that is needed in the hostile region that Türkiye’s geography and history impose. In addition, the country’s developments in unmanned combat technology, such as the Bayraktar TB2, are making all Turks proud, and many countries are expressing the desire to acquire it. As one Le Monde headline stated: It sells like croissants (ça se vent comme des croissants).\n\nFrom an economic point of view, Türkiye is fully integrated into the European sphere. Its number one economic partner is Germany. Ankara is perfectly positioned to play on the EU members’ differences to assert its position towards the shaky EU.\n\nIn summary, reflecting on the past relationship, the two nations generated competition, and sometimes rivalry, due to post-modern local politics and regional geopolitics. France-Türkiye relations are old like the Peace of Westphalia international system. Diplomats always recall the backhand alliance concluded in 1536 between French King François I and Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. Showing both their unconventional character for the sake of their nations and their people’s best interest in a tumultuous world affairs disorder.\n\nWhy does Macron not read that letter sent by King François I to Sultan Suleiman in order to better understand Erdoğan’s leading role in the region? Or does he prefers Napoleon Bonaparte’s campaign in the Egypt story?\n\nHistory sometimes is like real life, it prefers good stories.\n\n*North Africa expert at the Center for Middle Eastern Strategic Studies (ORSAM)",

    "France sees a record rise in foreign students": "The number of international students registered in France rose by 8% in 2021-2022, and went over 400,000: it is the highest growth in 15 years, thanks to the growth of the number of European students. A clear rebound confirmed by recruitment outlooks for the year 2022-2023, with applications on the rise by 18% compared with the pre-pandemic period.\n\nMore than 400,000 foreign students in France, up 8% from the previous year\n\nAfter a year of stagnation in 2020-2021 in the context of the pandemic (-1%), the number of foreign students registers for the year 2021-2022 the stronger interannual growth since 2005: +8% (source Ministry of Higher education and Research/SIES). Including apprentices in higher education, the threshold of 400,000 foreign students in France has just been crossed (400,026).\n\nImage Source: MESR/SIES, 2022\n\nTOP 10: Significant rise in students from neighboring countries in Europe\n\nAmong the top 10 countries of origin of students in France, the most significant increases are those of Italian (4th origin, +16%), Spanish (7th, +25%) and Lebanese (9th, +30%) students.\n\nSome origins, which had previously been on the decline, have been on the rise again over the past year (Germany, +17%; USA, +50%). Only mobility from China and Vietnam are still decreasing, with respectively -2% and -4% over one year.\n\nGreatest increase from Europe and the Americas\n\nIn terms of areas, figures show a particularly marked recovery over the last year for the Americas, Europe and the Middle East-North Africa (MENA):\n\nAmericas : with +15% students , this is the zone that is experiencing the strongest growth, particularly thanks to North America, with a number of students up by 43%. The number of students in Latin America and the Caribbean rose by 14%, and in South America by 4%.\n\nEurope (+13%) has seen the strongest growth over one year after the Americas and is back to a level 10% higher than before the pandemic. Non-EU countries - which now include the United Kingdom - are up by 25%, and EU countries by 9%.\n\nThe Middle East and North Africa , the leading zone in terms of the number of students received, increased by 10% over one year and by 32% over five years. And there’s a particularly significant increase from the Middle East (+17%).\n\nSub-Saharan Africa registered a 5% increase , below the average of 8%: the increase in the number of African students had in fact continued in 2020-21 (+6%). Over five years, the increase remains strong (40%) and above the average (21%).\n\nAsia-Oceania, where student numbers have only increased by 1% over one year, remains the region most affected by the mobility restrictions linked to the pandemic. But after a 9% drop in 2020-21, the situation is stabilising. While China, Vietnam and Australia are in decline, a recovery is emerging in India (+9.5%), Japan (+12%) and Sri Lanka (+17%).\n\nMore and more business schools students\n\nThough figures are rising in all institutions, they have jumped in business schools, which have seen an increase of 18%. Foreign students increased by 7% in high school courses, 6% in universities, 5% in art and architecture schools, 3% in engineering schools and 7% in other institutions.\n\nRecord number of applications for 2022/2023\n\nThis rebound recorded during the academic year 2021/22 seems to be confirmed for the 2022/23 year: at the end of August 2022, more than 140,000 students from 70 countries worldwide had applied via “Etudes en France”. A record number on the rise by 18% compared with the pre-Covid situation [1].\n\n[1] Increase calculated on a like-for-like basis in countries where the “Etudes en France” procedure already existed in 2018/19, reference year before Covid.",
    "France: business climate shows worsening outlook": "Growth is likely to falter in the coming months\n\nOverall, the business climate indicator is a clear sign of a slowdown in economic activity in France, both now and in the coming months. While the spring and summer have been synonymous with more dynamic activity than expected, thanks in particular to the end of Covid restrictions and the return of foreign tourists, the autumn and winter look much more difficult for the French economy. Major uncertainty, high energy and raw material prices and potential disruptions to energy supplies are weighing on the industrial sector. At the same time, the deterioration in purchasing power caused by inflation, the decline in consumer confidence and the attenuation of the positive effects of the post-pandemic reopening are limiting the dynamism of the services sector. As a result, there is no longer any real engine to maintain a dynamic pace of growth in economic activity. The only good news is the labour market, which remains strong, as indicated by the employment climate, which rose by two points in September to return to its July level. While there are signs that the labour market may start to weaken in the coming months, it currently remains very robust and the labour shortage remains significant, which should limit the speed of any rise in the unemployment rate.\n\nThe business climate index confirms that the question is no longer whether France is heading for recession, but rather when the recession is coming. Given the developments of the last few weeks, it is feared that French GDP growth will move into negative territory in the third quarter. We expect growth of 2.2% for the whole of 2022 and -0.2% for 2023.",

    "The New Eco-Friendly Startup Sailing Between France And The U.K.": "Arrival into Dover from France with the new startup SailLink SailLink\n\nAt its shortest point, the crossing between England and France is just 21 miles (or 32 kilometres) between Dover and Cap Gris Nez, a cape near Calais. A short distance that has been amplified by two years of pandemic and further constrained by the increased bureaucracy imposed since Brexit.\n\nThe result is that it can sometimes feel much more than the 20 or so miles. Particularly for foot passengers, who have traditionally been under-catered for—or those with bikes or wheelchairs.\n\nA new sailing startup, SailLink, funded through a mixture of Crowdfunding and the Blue Living Lab in Boulogne-sur-Mer, is confident that it can start offering an eco-friendly alternative to existing ferries and planes—and begin running return trips for passengers by 2023.\n\nSailLink plans to operate between Dover and Boulogne-sur-Mer first but will then hopefully expand to two other routes. In 2024, between Dunkirk and Ramsgate and in 2025, the longer route between Newhaven and Dieppe.\n\nThe pilot phase is using a 12-metre boat that can accommodate six passengers and two bikes but the hope is for a larger boat that can take 12 passengers with 12 bikes at a time, plus two wheelchairs.\n\nThe boat runs on wind power but the new prototype will have an electric propulsion system recharged by onboard solar panels. SailLink's founder, Andrew Simons, told The Guardian that \"while we will mainly rely on wind power, we will have to use mechanical propulsion when the wind drops and to get in and out of ports.”\n\nThe target audience is obviously people who are looking for a more authentic travel experience with a love of being on the water. Simons added, “we will particularly appeal to cyclists and foot passengers wanting the ocean experience, people looking for an alternative but convenient travel experience with some adventure, not just the green aspect.”\n\nDuring weekdays, passports would be stamped upon arrival in France by the Police aux Frontières who will meet the boat, allowing easy travel across the French border. However, at weekends it is currently more complicated and passports need to be stamped in Calais, a 40-minute train ride away. There are ad hoc border force checks taking place for arrivals and departures from Dover.\n\nThe crossing will take four hours and cost approximately £85 one-way ($90). Tickets are not yet on sail but Supporter Tickets are available and anyone interested can sign up to a mailing list for when tickets become available.",

    "Adif plans standard gauge conversion for section connecting to France": "Train to Zaragoza at Canfranc station WikiMedia, Jule_Berlin\n\nAdif has awarded the contract to draw up the project to implement standard gauge on the 138-kilometre long Huesca-Canfranc line in Spain. It is part of the effort to reopen a cross-border line across the Pyrenees to France which has been closed for decades.\n\nSpanish infrastructure manager Adif calls it a ‘decisive step’ towards the creation of a cross-border corridor to France through the Canfranc tunnel. Towards the north, the line between Huesca and Canfranc continues across the French border, a line known as the Pau-Canfranc railway, or Goya Line after the painter Francisco de Goya who was born near Zaragoza and died in Bordeaux.\n\nThe Spanish railway network largely consists of tracks with Iberian gauge (1,668 mm), except for the later built high-speed lines. To better connect to the cross-border line, Adif is converting the section to standard European gauge. The action will enable connections to be made across the Pyrenees, boosting rail transport, says Adif. For freight traffic, it will also make it possible to connect important logistic nodes.\n\nThe drafting of the project for the section Huesca – Canfranc has been awarded to the Temporary Joint Venture formed by Meta Engineering and Subterra Ingeniería for 847,000 euros. It should be finished within a period of ten months as a preliminary step required to put the eventual construction works out to tender. The action is to be co-financed by the European Union’s Connecting Europe Facility (CEF).\n\nLong-closed line\n\nThe Pau – Canfranc railway line was closed south of Bedous, France, after a major derailment accident with a freight train in March 1970 destroyed the L’Estanguet bridge south of Accous. This forced the suspension of traffic on the French side, also stopping international traffic on the 310-kilometre Zaragoza – Canfranc-Pau line.\n\nA financing agreement for a study into the revival of the Pau – Canfranc line was signed in 2017 by the French region of Nouvelle-Aquitaine, the Spanish region of Aragon, and the European Commission. The reopening of the international line linking Zaragoza – Canfranc – Pau is getting closer thanks to the collaboration of all the administrations and the support of the European funds obtained in two calls for proposals from the CEF financing instrument, in 2016 and 2019.\n\nIn June 2016, a French section between Oloron-Sainte-Marie and Bedous reopened. This section of around 60 kilometres between Pau and Bedous is used by local TER Nouvelle-Aquitaine passenger trains. Connecting buses currently run from Bedous to Canfranc while cross-border train traffic is not possible. Trains continue on the Spanish side from Canfranc International Railway Station, departing south to Jaca and Zaragoza.\n\nImplementation of ERTMS\n\nIn addition to implementing the standard gauge, the project for Huesca-Canfranc envisages equipping the line with the ERTMS (European Rail Traffic Management System) train control and command system to guarantee the interoperability of cross-border traffic. Moreover, 450-metre sidings will be built at the stations and an electrification plan will be made. The necessary actions will be defined for infrastructural elements such as level crossings, tunnels, bridges and overpasses and underpasses.\n\nAdif also continues to make progress on other parts in the modernisation of the Zaragoza-Huesca-Canfranc line. The first phase of works on the railway platform in the area of Zuera (Zaragoza) was recently completed, and the company is currently making progress on the complete renovation of the track on one of the sections between Huesca and Canfranc, the Plasencia del Monte-Ayerbe section. The same works will soon be contracted on two other sections: Ayerbe-Caldearenas and Jaca-Canfranc.\n\nRead more:",

    "How France aims to streamline, simplify arms and ammo acquisition": "PARIS — Like for the US, the conflict in Ukraine has shown the French military that it must simplify its procurement procedures and ensure the armed forces’ stocks of ammunition are built-up, as the country raises its geostrategic alert level, according to a recent government report.\n\nThe report was published Sept. 9 following a meeting between France’s defense minister, CEOs of the country’s principal defense manufacturers, the chiefs of defense staff, the director of the DGA (direction générale de l’armement) procurement agency and the secretary general for defense and national security.\n\nThe defense minister, Sébastien Lecornu, told media afterward that normally the acquisition processes is onerous and complicated, a luxury of peacetime. “But in times of war,” he said, apparently referring to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, “when we need to go fast and take risks, we need a different approach.”\n\nLecornu organized the meeting in response to President Emmanuel Macron’s speech at the opening of the 15th biennial Eurosatory land armaments exhibition in Paris in June. There the French president exhorted industry to “go faster, think differently about production rates, ramp-up […] in order to be able to more quickly reconstitute [stocks of] equipment indispensable for our armed forces, for our allies and for those whom we want to help.”\n\nBut the meeting was also in response to Macron’s traditional pre-Bastille day speech to the armed forces on July 13 in which he said that in order to prepare France for “a possible high-intensity conflict,” he wanted a new military program law (MPL) for 2024-2030 cutting into the current 2019-2026 MPL which he feels is no longer adequate. MPLs, approved by the French parliament, set defense priorities and provide a framework for acquisition.\n\nThe Ministry of the Armed Forces has three levels for qualifying geo-strategic developments: competition, dispute, confrontation. According to the statement published by the ministry after the meeting this month, “the war in Ukraine has pushed France into the ‘dispute’ alert level. This evolution of the threat implies a necessary adaptation of our production tool.”\n\nTo help industry adapt to the new situation, Lecornu emphasized four points during the meeting:\n\n1. Focus on quantity and simplicity. Lecornu said he wants procurement requirements issued by the ministry to focus as much on production capacities as on design. He stressed that innovation should not stand in the way of simplicity. To meet the requirements for greater quantities of materiel, the DGA Procurement Agency and the armies “must formulate requests that are simpler to carry out. Each option on a piece of equipment is an obstacle to the speed of manufacturing,” he warned.\n\nIn a press conference after the meeting Lecornu explained that “the more options you have, the more sophisticated the equipment, the more complicated it is, the less rustic it becomes and the longer it takes to produce.”\n\n2. Streamline the acquisition process. The minister noted in the meeting that “since February 24, the notions of risks and dangers have evolved considerably and require a change of approach” to acquisition. And so, he said, it is essential that administrative procedures for manufacturers be simplified. Emmanuel Chiva, the new head of the DGA, and his deputy, Thierry Carlier, have received a mandate to work with manufacturers to figure out a process that would simplify procedures whilst not sacrificing the requirement for quality.\n\n“That doesn’t mean we’re going to lower our standards of quality but we unquestionably need to know how to take a few risks, including in our procedures by reducing them,” Lecornu said.\n\n3. Bring tech home and protect the supply chain. Lecornu wants manufacturers to relocate their subcontractors in France, or at least the European Union (EU), so as to not be dependent on foreign know-how and to protect French know-how. “The COVID crisis has shown us that anything that is not produced on our territory or at least on European territory, cannot be considered as a secure supply source,” he reminded them.\n\n4. Prepare for the long term. The war in Ukraine has revealed how important it is to have stocks, particularly of ammunition. In the transition to a war economy, the French armed forces will replenish their ammunition stocks, which will now be assessed in light of the potential for a major engagement. In addition, the minister asked manufacturers to build up reserves of raw materials to be able to respond promptly to orders from the ministry.\n\nThe idea that defense companies might pool their stocks is currently being studied. “For years, having stocks was considered poor management,” Lecornu told media after the meeting. “But today, we need to return to good household management and, to continue with the metaphor, have a sufficient stock of groceries to hold out.”\n\nFor their part, manufacturers have also committed to significantly accelerate production of priority materials. For example, 155 mm shells will need to be delivered in three months instead of nine. The Caesar gun, 18 of which have been given to Ukraine will be produced in just 12 months, half the time as is currently done, according to the ministry.\n\n“This need for speed is not just the thinking in France,” Lecornu noted. “The same reflection is taking place throughout the Western world.”\n\nLecornu told media he’d also discussed with industry the risks of espionage and sabotage in the upcoming weeks and months, including “Cold War practices which we thought behind us.”\n\n“We have instances of industrial espionage over the past few years which entails stealing a technology to take it home. Sabotage is something else. It harms the production chain, and you can understand the dramatic effects that could have,” he said. “We have noticed and are keeping an eye on a certain number of actions, which I can’t say more about because they’re confidential, but our services have identified a certain number of things, and so our defense industries are working with a number of our services to build resilience to avoid any malicious acts, or even sabotage on vital materiel.”",
    "12 million people in France have drunk pesticide-contaminated water": "Up to 12 million people in France have drunk tap water that contains pesticide levels above the acceptable quality threshold, it has emerged this week.\n\nA report by FranceInfo and Le Monde yesterday (September 22), which was also highlighted on the Complément d’enquête programme on France 2, revealed the number, which equates to around 20% of the population.\n\nIn Brittany, the percentage is estimated to be as high as 43% of the population affected.\n\nAcross France, pesticides that are judged to be potentially dangerous must not exceed the threshold of 0.1 micrograms per litre (or 0.3 micrograms for some), and the total must not exceed 0.5 micrograms per litre. These thresholds were set in 2007.\n\nHealth norms are usually set after studies by health and food safety agency l’Agence nationale de sécurité sanitaire de l’alimentation, de l’environnement et du travail (Anses). But studies do not yet exist for all pesticides.\n\nNumbers ‘probably’ underestimated\n\nWater treatment specialist at the University of Montpellier, Julie Mendret, told Ouest France that the numbers were “a drop in the ocean”. She said: “Analysis methods are developing. The more we look, the more we will find [pesticides in water]. We are even finding banned pesticides.”\n\nIn December 2020, health authority la Direction générale de la Santé extended its research of pesticides in water, and found that the percentage of people in France who were affected had grown from 6% in 2020 to 20% in 2021.\n\nThe results are “predictable”, said Mickaël Derangeon, vice-president of Loire-Atlantique public drinking water distribution service Atlantic'eau, and physiology lecturer at Nantes University.\n\nThey are even \"probably below reality\", he added.\n\nDrinking water in France is monitored by two different checks. The first comes from regional health authorities the Agences régionales de Santé (ARS), which determines a list of molecules to research.\n\nMs Mendret said: “The limits are determined according to the pesticides used locally.” For example, in Corsica, 30 molecules are searched for, compared to 386 in Île-de-France.\n\nThe managers of drinking water networks also carry out their own checks, with many going above and beyond the minimum checks required.\n\nFor example, Mr Derangeon said: “In Loire-Atlantique, we go further [and] we publish the results. We also carry out tests, so we take the water and put it on bacteria, human cells, fungi... to see the effect on living things.\n\n“So far, we haven't seen any impact, which is reassuring. But we cannot certify that there is no risk to pregnant women or babies.”\n\nAre pesticides at worrying levels in French tap water?\n\nYes and no, experts say.\n\nThe health ministry has said: \"The long-term health effects of exposure to low doses of pesticides are difficult to assess.”\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Derangeon has said that while tap water is still safe to drink, \"water is the basis of life. It is not normal to find pesticides in it. Pesticides are used to kill insects and plants\".\n\nHowever, he said that pesticide levels in water are far lower than those found in food.\n\nHe said: \"The scale is different in food. Conventional food [not organically grown] can legally contain up to 500,000 times more pesticides in 1kg, than a litre of water. In 1kg of celery, you can legally have as much pesticide as in 500,000 litres of water.\n\n\"But even in small amounts, pesticides can have consequences. The risk with water is exposure over the long term or at certain times of life, for example when you are a baby or pregnant.”\n\nHe has said that while “the scientific evidence” is there, “there has been no public response [yet]”.\n\nIn its report, Le Monde said that “the breaching of thresholds does not necessarily mean there is a risk to health”.\n\nHowever, Arnaud Clugery, director and spokesman for Eau et Rivières de Bretagne, has taken a harsher stance.\n\nHe said: “ESA-metolachlor is a pesticide by-product from a maize weed killer. Who can think today that a chemical molecule designed to kill living organisms is safe in drinking water?\n\nWhat are water bodies and experts calling for in response?\n\nMr Clugery, in Brittany, has said: \"We are asking for the protection of water catchment areas and not just the protection perimeters.”\n\nBrittany was shown to have the highest pesticide levels in the country.\n\nEau et Rivières de Bretagne has also published a plea for pesticide-free drinking water on its website.\n\nIt reads: \"We demand that the public authorities become truly aware of the widespread contamination of water by pesticides and that ambitious measures are finally taken to put an end to the large-scale use of these toxic substances.”.\n\nSo do we need to drink bottled water instead?\n\nNot necessarily, except perhaps if you are pregnant or vulnerable.\n\nRead more: Bottled or tap: How do you take your water in France?\n\nDespite his concerns, Mr Derangeon said that he still drinks tap water, mainly because “when I buy bottled water, I don’t know how long it has stood there for, maybe in the sunshine”. He also said that some studies have shown the presence of microplastics in bottled water, “so it’s not a solution”.\n\nMs Mendret has also said that “it would be catastrophic if everyone started drinking bottled water”, because of the plastic bottle waste that would ensue.\n\nHowever, she said in an article over the summer that in intensive farming regions, “we should temporarily stop drinking tap water”. She used the example of the village of Castellet in Var, where pesticide levels were found to be at 0.7 micrograms per litre. Locals are now advised not to drink the tap water.\n\nRead more: Tap water more safe to drink in urban areas\n\nYet, Mr Derangeon said that the situation was being monitored. He said: “Water is the most tested element in France.”\n\nHe said that people who really want to switch to bottled water should only use water in glass bottles, and recycle or reuse them.\n\nRelated articles\n\nExtra chlorine in tap water in France due to Covid-19\n\nToo much lead in tap water’",

    "Joint Statement of Support for Lebanon from the United States, France, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia": "Begin Text.\n\nToday, representatives from the United States, France, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia met to discuss Lebanon on the margins of the UN General Assembly. The following statement is attributable to the Ministers of the three countries.\n\nOur three countries expressed their continuing support for Lebanon’s sovereignty, security, and stability. As Lebanon’s Parliament prepares to elect a new President, we stress the importance of timely elections in compliance with the constitution. It is critical to elect a President who can unite the Lebanese people and work with regional and international actors to overcome the current crisis. We call for the formation of a government capable of implementing the structural and economic reforms urgently needed to address Lebanon’s political and economic crises, specifically those reforms needed to reach an agreement with the International Monetary Fund.\n\nWe are willing to work jointly with Lebanon to support the implementation of these fundamental reform measures, which are critical to the country’s future prosperity, stability, and security. We acknowledge the critical role the Lebanese Armed Forces and the Internal Security Forces – as the legitimate defenders of Lebanon’s sovereignty and internal stability – continue to play in protecting the Lebanese people in a time of unprecedented crisis. We affirm the need for the Lebanese government to implement the provisions of UN Security Council resolutions 1559, 1680, 1701, 2650, and other relevant international resolutions, including those issued by the Arab League, and commit to the Taif Agreement which enables the preservation of national unity and civil peace in Lebanon.\n\nEnd Text.",

    "Best regions to visit in France": "Rich with culture, cuisine, ancient architecture and glorious countryside, France is one of the world’s most rewarding places to travel.\n\nEvery corner of this picturesque country has its own unique character and charm that will influence where you ultimately decide to go and how to allocate your time. Piece together the jigsaw with our introduction to France’s best regions to visit.\n\nWalking through the streets of Paris is one of the best ways to immerse yourself in Parisian culture © LeoPatrizi / iStock\n\nStroll the monument-lined streets and magnificent gardens of Paris\n\nThe French capital is likely to be one of your most unforgettable memories of France. Defined by icons like the Eiffel Tower glittering by night, Arc de Triomphe straddling the Champs-Élysées and Sacré-Cœur crowning hilltop Montmartre, Paris is crammed with megastar museums like the Louvre and impressionist-filled Musée d’Orsay; the mansion-housed Musée Carnavalet brings the city’s history to life.\n\nParis’ boulevards and backstreets are made for flânerie (walking without any particular destination), with cafe terraces, cocktail bars, jazz clubs and cinemas, specialized boutiques, street art and innovative cultural spaces at every turn. Parisian parks like the chestnut-shaded Jardin du Luxembourg provide peaceful oases.\n\nIn the surrounding Île-de-France region, spectacular châteaux (Versailles, Fontainebleau and Chantilly, among others) and family favorite Disneyland Paris are an easy day trip away.\n\nExplore the planet's most surprising adventures with our weekly newsletter delivered to your inbox.\n\nDelve into the sparkling cities and vineyards of Champagne\n\nThe world’s finest fizz is produced in the beautiful region of Champagne, east of Paris, with prestigious Champagne houses offering cellar tours and tastings, dedicated museums and Champagne routes through its vineyards and villages.\n\nAt the heart of Champagne’s viticultural activity is graceful Épernay. The region’s largest city, Reims, is topped by the sublime Gothic Cathédrale Notre Dame and is renowned for fine dining. A medieval treasure of a town, Troyes has a magical half-timbered center. Renoir took artistic inspiration from the vineyards around pretty Essoyes.\n\nFall under the spell of enchanting Alsace and Lorraine\n\nEast of Champagne, Lorraine is famously associated with its namesake quiche – a must-try while you’re here. Beyond the WWI battlefields of Verdun, fascinating cities include Metz, showcasing modern and contemporary art at the striking Centre-Pompidou-Metz; and refined Nancy.\n\nEast again, Alsace runs along the German border to Switzerland in the south. This fairy-tale region of mountains, forests and chocolate-box-pretty half-timbered buildings trailing geraniums in summer retains its Germanic influence in its hearty food such as choucroute garnie (sauerkraut with charcuterie) and white wines, best sampled along the Alsace Wine Route. Medieval architecture is splendidly preserved in the cities of Strasbourg and Colmar.\n\nSee battlefields, beaches and beautiful cities in Northern France\n\nNorth of Paris is Hauts-de-France (Upper France). Its chalk-cliff-framed Côte d'Opale, beaches and wildlife-rich Baie de Somme estuaries are well worth exploration, along with the Somme’s sobering WWI memorials.\n\nOn the Belgian border, industrial-center-turned-design-hub Lille is the biggest city with outstanding museums (one is even set in an art-deco swimming pool) and a strong Flemish influence in its historic center, as well as its beer, which is used in local dishes like a Welsh (cheese melted in beer smothering ham-topped toast). Smaller cities such as Arras and Amiens have Gothic treasures, while Napoléon III's Second Empire reigns in Compiègne.\n\nNormandy is a history lover's paradise, with monuments like the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial, which honors American soldiers who died fighting in Europe during WWII © StephenBridger / iStock\n\nSoak up centuries of history in Normandy\n\nNorthwest of Paris, Normandy is steeped in history: the Bayeux Tapestry that weaves together the story of William the Conqueror's 1066 invasion of England; the offshore abbey-island of Mont St-Michel, which was fortified during the Middle Ages; the medieval city of Rouen; Monet’s former home and flower-filled gardens in Giverny; and haunting D-Day beaches near Caen, with its imposing 11th-century castle.\n\nNormandy’s coastline gifts the region with seafood (idyllically savored in boat-filled Honfleur) while inland, lush pastures produce butter, cream and cheese – including in the village of Camembert – and orchards producing Calvados apple brandy and corked bottles of cider.\n\nConnect with Celtic culture in Brittany\n\nTo the west of Normandy, Brittany breaks away to the Atlantic. Its earliest neolithic tribes left what’s now the world’s greatest concentration of megalithic standing stones around Carnac, followed by the Celts.\n\nCeltic influence endures in the Breton language, music and identity. Brittany retains the sense of a mystical land, from Josselin’s turreted castle in the forest to the lively capital Rennes. Around the lighthouse-dotted coastline from the walled port town of St-Malo, in far-flung Finistère, and out on islands like Belle Île scattered offshore, the seafood is superb (especially petit bleu Breton lobsters and oysters from Cancale). But the region is best known for savory galettes and sweet crêpes with salted-butter caramel, accompanied by local Breton cider.\n\nThe Château de Chambord is the most impressive castle in the Loire Valley © cmspic / Getty Images\n\nMarvel at the majestic châteaux of the Loire Valley\n\nFrance’s longest river winds through the fertile Loire Valley southwest of Paris, where royalty and aristocracy built defensive castles and palaces so grand that the entire area is now a Unesco World Heritage site.\n\nFrom Orléans (saved by Joan of Arc in 1429), the Loire meanders west, with resplendent châteaux including Chambord, regal Royal de Blois, drawbridge-accessed Chaumont-sur-Loire, Italian Rennaissance–style Gaillard and, astride an arched bridge, Chenonceau. Past the university town of Tours, châteaux include stately gardens at Villandry, moated Azay-le-Rideau, equestrian-famed Saumur and medieval Angers. Valley vineyards produce exquisite wines (especially whites) paired with sophisticated cuisine.\n\nFurther west, the river reaches the Atlantic near Nantes, the former capital of Brittany (with legacies including the Château des Ducs de Bretagne and crêperies galore), which is now one of France’s most creative cities.\n\nSavor the flavors and famous abbeys of Burgundy\n\nTo Paris’ southeast, Burgundy is a patchwork of stone-walled vineyards, medieval towns and villages, and extraordinary ecclesiastical sights, including Cluny, Christendom’s one-time grandest abbey, former Roman stronghold Autun’s colossal medieval cathedral, early 12th-century Abbaye de Fontenay and Vézelay’s hilltop basilica.\n\nIn Burgundy’s atmospheric capital of Dijon, the Duke of Burgundy’s palace now houses a fine-arts museum, while the Cité Internationale de la Gastronomie et du Vin (International City of Gastronomy and Wine) schools visitors in the region’s culinary specialties (such as sharp mustard, garlicky snails and red-wine-rich bœuf bourguignon) and its revered wines. In Grand Cru country, Beaune has a subterranean maze of wine cellars and medieval architectural gems with multicolored glazed roof tiles.\n\nPopular ski town Chamonix's ski lifts access spectacular hiking and biking trails during the summer © JolieQ / Getty Images\n\nAscend the peaks of the French Alps and Jura Mountains\n\nEast of Burgundy, the sub-alpine Jura Mountains along the Swiss border formed during the Jurassic period (hence their name). The terrain is ripe for mountain cheeses and wine (including distinctive, golden-hued vin jaune). Urban cultural centers include citadel-guarded Besançon.\n\nTraveling south of Lake Geneva, the higher, mightier French Alps reach their apex at Mont Blanc. Exhilarating Chamonix, along with Val d'Isère and the world’s largest ski area, Les 3 Vallées, are magnets for snowy winter sports and high-altitude summer hiking, fortified by melted cheese dishes like bubbling fondue.\n\nSample epicurean treats and outdoor pursuits in the Rhône Valley\n\nDirectly south of Burgundy, France’s third-largest city, Lyon, sits at the confluence of the rivers Saône and Rhône. Grand squares, outstanding museums and long-standing traditions, including convivial bouchons (bistros serving rustic Lyonnaise cuisine), entice visitors to stay longer than planned.\n\nRenowned vineyards ribbon across the valley as the Rhône flows south. En route, Gallo-Roman ruins in Vienne include a Corinthian-columned temple. Canoeing is the best way to see the dramatic scenery and natural stone bridge of the Gorges de l'Ardèche.\n\nParc Naturel Régional des Volcans d'Auvergne has countless options for hiking, biking and skiing © kodachrome25 / Getty Images\n\nRejuvenate in the volcanic landscapes and spas of the Auvergne\n\nIn central France, west of the Rhône is the Auvergne. Nature’s heavy machinery is still apparent in the volcanic cinder cones of the Parc Naturel Régional des Volcans d'Auvergne, and lava pinnacles topped by a 10th-century church in pilgrimage town Le Puy-en-Velay.\n\nBlack lava stone is used in the construction of buildings, including the mighty cathedral in the largest city, Clermont-Ferrand, the hometown of tire and travel giant Michelin (with an interesting museum). Natural springs include those in Belle Époque spa town Vichy. Auvergne specialties, including Le Puy lentils and some outstanding cheeses, sustain hiking in one of France’s least-explored regions.\n\nDiscover the different facets of southwestern France\n\nFrance’s southwest spans a vast corner of the country. Along the Atlantic Coast, it stretches south of Nantes past the sunny island Île de Ré and historic port La Rochelle to the red-wine country around Bordeaux and surfing mecca Biarritz in the French Basque Country, where pintxos (bite-sized Basque tapas) are the order of the day.\n\nInland are the river-threaded regions of Limousin, with its porcelain-famed city of Limoges. Visit the Dordogne (aka Périgord), where Vézère Valley caverns shelter rock art, truffles hide beneath the forest canopy, and markets such as those in medieval Sarlat-la-Canéda sell local specialties including geese, pâtés, walnuts, wine and cheeses. The Lot flows past charming villages and the lovely town of Cahors. Southwards, the city of Toulouse, with its rose-tinged buildings and energetic student population, is France’s fourth largest. To Toulouse’s south, the Pyrenees climb to the Spanish border.\n\nThe pristine dunes of Montpellier's white-sand beaches make for a relaxing escape © Lepretre Pierre / Getty Images\n\nExplore Roman ruins and sandy beaches in Languedoc-Roussillon\n\nThe southern region of Roussillon is also known as French Catalonia and isn’t far from the border crossing into Spain, especially around Mediterranean resort towns like Collioure. Perpignan is the main city here.\n\nInland in the Languedoc are the wild, highland areas of Grands Causses and Cévennes; walled Carcassonne with its witches-hat turrets and restaurants serving its local twist on white-bean and meat stew cassoulet. The engineering marvel Canal du Midi runs 150 miles (240km) from Toulouse to the Étang de Thau lagoon, adjacent to the Languedoc fishing port of Sète.\n\nAround the coast is appealing Montpellier’s historic core and broad beaches. Roman Nîmes has an incredibly well-preserved amphitheater and handy access to the enormous aqueduct, Pont du Gard.\n\nTraverse the romantic landscapes of Provence\n\nProvence’s honey-hued stone villages tumble down hillsides to lavender-striped plateaus. Olive groves and rosé-producing vineyards, open-air markets bursting with freshly picked tomatoes, melons, cherries and other seasonal produce, and translucent turquoise coves along the rocky Mediterranean coast are the stuff of postcards.\n\nAlong with rural charms, Provence has well-heeled cities and towns like walled Avignon, with its famous bridge, arts festival and papal history; the splashing fountains and tree canopies of elegant Aix-en-Provence; and Arles, famously painted by Van Gogh. By contrast, Provence’s biggest city (and France’s second largest), Marseille, is a fascinating multicultural metropolis set around its ancient Vieux Port (old port) with fantastic museums and restaurants specializing in its famous fish stew, bouillabaisse.\n\nFind beachside bliss on the French Riviera\n\nSoutheast of Provence, the French Riviera is known in France as the Côte d'Azur for the azure-blue color of the Mediterranean glittering in the bright sun.\n\nGlamorous beach resorts are strung along the coastline like pearls, among them the quaint former fishing village and sizzling-hot clubs of St-Tropez, film-festival-famed Cannes, Picasso’s one-time residence Antibes, the colorful seaside city of Nice with its sweeping promenade and sun-lounger-lined pebbled beach, sweet little harbor Villefranche-sur-Mer, and – past the principality of Monaco, with its Formula 1 Grand Prix and high-rolling Monte Carlo casino – old-world Menton by the Italian border. High up in the hinterland, Grasse grows fragrant flowers for French perfumeries.\n\nSet sail for Corsica\n\nWild, rugged and mountainous, the Mediterranean island of Corsica is an outdoor paradise laced with epic hiking trails. Linked to the French mainland by ferries (and flights), it has been part of France for over two centuries but retains a strong independence in its language, culture and cuisine that includes bread made from ground-down chestnut flour, charcuterie (such as seasonal chestnut-wood-smoked pork liver sausage and wild-boar pâté) and distinctive cheeses (many made from the milk of goats, which roam the island’s steep hillsides).\n\nAround Corsica’s coastline, striking sights stretch from the winding roads of Cap Corse peninsula in the north to Les Calanques de Piana’s fiery red rock formations, Napoléon Bonaparte’s sophisticated home town of Ajaccio and, at the island’s southern tip, fortified Bonifacio’s breathtaking white limestone cliffs plunging into the sea.",
    "China appreciates France's opposition to \"new Cold War\": Chinese FM": "Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi (R) meets with Emmanuel Bonne, diplomatic counselor to French President Emmanuel Macron, on the sidelines of the ongoing 77th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York, the United States, Sept. 21, 2022.
