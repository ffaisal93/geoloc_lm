    "Latvia Registered 2 Asylum Requests From Russians Fleeing Mobilisation as of Saturday": "The Latvian authorities have revealed that two citizens of Russia requested asylum in the country as of Saturday, September 24.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe Ministry of Interior of Latvia explained that the requests for asylum were received following Russia’s mobilisation, SchengenVisaInfo.com reports.\n\nNonetheless, despite receiving these two applications, the authorities have made clear that they will not grant asylum to those fleeing mobilisation.\n\nAccording to the Public Broadcasting of Latvia (LSM), the Minister of Interior of Latvia, Kristaps Eklons, said that mobilisation in Russia does not constitute sufficient grounds for being granted asylum in the country.\n\nIn addition, the Minister noted that each case would be assessed individually and, at the same time, pointed out that asylum en masse has never been granted in Latvia, and it will not do so in the future.\n\nLSM explains that the State Border Guard has already stepped up controls at the border in order to prevent the border from being crossed by citizens of Russia who are trying to avoid mobilisation.\n\nApart from receiving two asylum requests, the Ministry of Interior revealed that the country refused entry to a total of 23 Russians since September 19, when the entry ban officially entered into force.\n\nLatvia, together with the other Baltic States and Poland, introduced an entry ban for Russian on September 19 and stopped issuing Schengen visas for them.\n\nIn line with the current rules that Latvia has, citizens of Russia holding a visitor Schengen visa issued by the Latvian authorities or any other country are not permitted entry. However, the authorities have not that certain exemptions apply.\n\nAs soon as such strict measures entered into force, the authorities reported that the number of Russians attempting to cross the border significantly decreased. The government said earlier this week that the number of citizens of Russia who tried to enter Latvia was around 1,000 since September 19.\n\nAdditionally, the same revealed that 27 of the Russians attempting to cross the border had C visas, seven per cent of them had D visas, 53 per cent of them had residence permits that are issued to family members of Latvian nationals, and another 13 per cent of them were seafarers who cannot leave the ship.\n\nSimilar to Latvia, the other two Baltic countries, Lithuania and Estonia, have also said that they will not grant asylum o citizens of Russia fleeing mobilisation. The foreign ministers of the three Baltic States said that Russians fleeing their country to avoid mobilisation will not enjoy special treatment.",
    "Sewage monitoring indicates a surge of Covid-19 spread in Latvia": "Sewage monitoring data for some of Latvia’s cities indicates an increase of coronavirus concentration, which indicates a surge of the spread of Covid-19, as reported on Twitter by Latvian Biomedical Research and Study Centre representative Dita Gudra.\n\nSeptember’s monitoring data indicates increased concentration of the virus in sewer water in Riga, Jurmala, Liepaja and Jelgava. Measurements in Liepaja, however, show signs of stabilisation and reduced concentration of the virus.\n\nA sharp surge is reported in Ventspils, which contradicts data reported by the Disease Prevention and Control Centre (SPKC).\n\nIn Valmiera and Jekabpils there is an increase of coronavirus concentration reported, which indicates increased spread of the infection.\n\nA sharp increase of concentration of the virus is observed in Tukums as well, where measurements are on a sharp rise. The situation in Salaspils also indicates increased concentration of Covid-19.\n\nIn all Latvian municipalities surveyed the dominant Covid-19 variant is Omicron sub-variant BA4/5, which is found in more than 95% of cases.\n\nAs previously reported, Latvia has adopted a system to monitor SARS-CoV-2 particles in sewer water in order to predict outbreaks of the virus in populated areas.\n\nThe research included BIOR, Riga Technical University’s Water Research and Environmental Biotechnology Laboratory and Latvian Biomedical Research and Study Centre.\n\nAccording to information published on BIOR website, sewer monitoring plays an important role in viral epidemiology. Analysis of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus in samples taken from sewage systems provides additional information to SPKC and other health institutions in order to predict and observe dynamics of the spread of the virus.\n\nThe advantage of this monitoring approach is that it is possible to determine the presence of infected people who have and don’t have symptoms in a municipality.\n\nCollection of sewage samples from centralised systems is done twice a week. These samples are then delivered to BIOR and Latvian Biomedical Research and Study Centre, which analyse those samples for presence of SARS-CoV-2 particles and viral RNA. Samples are tested for other public health related particles.",

The Ministers discussed bilateral relations, relations between the EU and the Republic of South Africa, and cooperation in international organizations,” the statement reads.\n\nIn this regard, Minister Rinkēvičs said that he hopes that the planned political consultations between the Foreign Ministries in Pretoria next October will provide an opportunity to identify areas of cooperation of common interest.\n\nAccording to him, Latvia is interested in developing business contacts in information technology, education and science, as well as in the logistics and transport sector, thus taking advantage of the benefits of Latvia’s ports and airports.\n\n“The signing of a convention on the prevention of double taxation, an air transport agreement, or a memorandum on economic cooperation would facilitate unlocking cooperation potential,” he also noted.\n\nAs the Ministry explains, the Ministers also exchanged positions regarding the war in Ukraine at the meeting. At the same time, the Latvian Foreign Minister said that for the first time in 2025, Latvia would be a candidate in the elections for the United Nations Security Council for the 2026-2027 mandate.\n\nMoreover, in 2015 Latvian exports to South Africa amounted to €6.9 million or 0.1 per cent of Latvia’s total exports, mainly wood and wooden articles, machinery, mechanisms and electrical equipment and vehicles.\n\nOn the other hand, imports from South Africa reached €1.0 million or 0.01 per cent of Latvia’s total imports, which included food, chemical and plant products. In addition, South Africa had no Latvian investments during this period. However, some small foreign direct investment of South Africa in Latvia of €33.1200 in 2016.",
    "Moscow Losing Another Nation’s Orthodox Church—This Time Latvia’s": "Since 1991, when the Soviet Union collapsed and the Orthodox faithful and leaders in the former Soviet republics and formerly occupied Baltic countries began to press for independence from the Moscow Patriarchate, the Russian Orthodox Church and equally the Russian government have been worried about these efforts and worked hard to oppose them. This anxiety was further exacerbated in January 2019 when the Ecumenical Patriarch granted autocephaly to the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, which cost Moscow its largest presence abroad (Novayagazeta.ru, March 27). Indeed, the Moscow Patriarchate is clearly in retreat almost everywhere in the former Soviet space, a retreat that has increased in speed given the Kremlin’s all-out aggression in Ukraine (see EDM, August 12, 2021). Now, Moscow is in the process of losing control over yet another national Orthodox church—this time in the Republic of Latvia.\n\nOn September 5, Latvian President Egils Levits called for the Seimas (Latvia’s parliament) to give the Latvian Orthodox Church autocephaly and thus formalize its complete independence from Moscow. Three days later, the country’s parliament passed a law that requires the Latvian Orthodox Church to bring its statute into conformity with the new law by October 31 and thus become independent from Moscow (Eng.lsm.lv, September 5; Meduza, September 5). The parliament acted so quickly because, according to Levits, such a change was required for Latvia’s national security given the long history of Moscow using Orthodox churches abroad for political purposes (Orthodoxtimes.com, September 10).\n\nNot surprisingly, the Moscow Patriarchate and Kremlin media have reacted with fury. Archpriest Nikolay Balashov, an adviser to Moscow Patriarch Kirill, said this was a most unhappy development because Latvia’s constitution proclaims the separation of church and state. Balashov also characterized the move as totally unnecessary because the Latvian Orthodox Church has been self-administrating since 1992. He said it was a return to the medieval principle of cujus regio, ejus religio, which held that the ruler of a country determines its religion. Moreover, he made clear that, since the state has no right to grant autocephaly, Moscow has no intention of recognizing Riga’s action and that no other Orthodox church should either (Interfax-religion.ru, September 8; Stoletie.ru, September 9).\n\nMeanwhile, commentaries in pro-Kremlin media were even more emotional. One in Vzglyad, for example, labeled Latvia’s move as “completely fantastic and unprecedented in world practice” (Vzglyad, September 5). More independent Russian outlets were more cautious and apparently more accepting of something they consider inevitable in the current environment (Nezavisimaya gazeta, September 9).\n\nThe proximate cause of what Latvia has done lies in Ukraine, both in Russia’s war there and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate’s declaration of independence from Moscow because of the war and the earlier grant of autocephaly to the competing Orthodox Church of Ukraine. All this has echoed throughout Orthodox churches in the former Soviet republics and formerly occupied Baltic countries, which, in Soviet times, and in some earlier cases, were subordinate to Moscow. But Riga’s latest move is also the product of uniquely Latvian concerns about ending arrangements that its people and government see as surviving from the time of Soviet occupation, and they have good reason to believe Moscow has and will again use these arrangements to compromise Latvia’s independence.\n\nLike most things connected with the Russian Orthodox Church, its situation in Latvia has been both complex and murky. In 1921, after Latvia gained independence, the Russian Orthodox Church recognized the Latvian Orthodox Church as autonomous, but the Riga church remained nominally subordinate to the Moscow Patriarchate. In 1936, following the Soviet assassination of the head of the Orthodox Church in Latvia, the Ecumenical Patriarchate recognized the Latvian Orthodox Church as part of its dominion. The Soviets suppressed that arrangement when they occupied Latvia during World War II; but in December 1992, after Latvia regained independence, the Latvian Orthodox Church again became autonomous but did not depart from the canonical territory of the Moscow Patriarchate. That was not a program many Latvians welcomed because Moscow retained the right to appoint the church’s head and the Latvian church was required to follow Moscow’s decisions (Apn.ru, September 7).\n\nTensions regarding this have only increased over the past decade and have exploded since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his expanded invasion of Ukraine, an action Latvia has vehemently opposed. First of all, the Latvian government has published records from Soviet times showing that the metropolitan of the Latvian Orthodox Church was a KGB agent. Second, the Seimas passed a law requiring that the heads of all churches in Latvia must be Latvian citizens, something the Orthodox ones had not been but eventually conceded to despite fears in Moscow that it was giving up too much (Nezavisimaya gazeta, October 1, 2019). And third, the hitherto microscopic Latvian Orthodox Autonomous Church has begun to attract more followers and has become at least potentially a genuine competitor to the Latvian Orthodox Church, which has just over 100 parishes and a claimed membership of 350,000 (see EDM, October 17, 2019).\n\nGiven the small size of Latvia and the Latvian Orthodox Church, some may be inclined to dismiss this latest development as little more than a tempest in a teapot. But three primary reasons point to why that would be a mistake. First, Moscow has shown its willingness to use its church in Latvia to mobilize ethnic Russians against the regime and can be expected to do so in the coming weeks, thus creating another problem for Riga. Second, the Latvian action, one by the state regarding religion, may provide a model for other governments in the post-Soviet space to take similar actions, thus accelerating the departure of Orthodox churches from Moscow’s supervision—or at a minimum raising the battle of this possibility to government levels. And third, this Latvian action, coming as it does during the course of Putin’s war in Ukraine, will only intensify fissiparousness (cleavages) within the Orthodox world generally and indeed within Christianity as a whole regarding relations with Moscow by highlighting the unfortunate history of the Kremlin using the church for anything but religious ends.",

    "Neighbouring Russia, Latvians prep for war": "Latvia's fear of what Russia might do next has led to a four-fold increase in volunteers for the army's reserve force\n\nSkrunda (Latvia) (AFP) – When war erupted in Ukraine, the head of Latvia's fashion chamber Dita Danosa did not hesitate to become an army reservist, swapping her usually stylish clothes for military fatigues.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\n\"I really felt I couldn't be passive and just watch television,\" the 49-year-old told AFP at the Mezaine military training ground in western Latvia.\n\n\"So I decided, yes, the national guard was the place for me.\"\n\nSince Russian forces invaded Ukraine in February, Baltic states like Latvia -- which shares a border with Russia -- are anxious about what Moscow might do next.\n\nThis fear has led to a four-fold increase in volunteers, like Danosa, for the army's reserve force known as the national guard, or Zemessardze in Latvian.\n\n\"When the war started, all European values were endangered,\" Danosa said, punctuating the silence between the bursts of two bullets.\n\nWhile Latvia's EU and NATO membership reassured her, Danosa said she felt under threat \"because Russian aggression is unpredictable and we don't know what can happen\".\n\nDressed in full combat clothing, including a magazine belt, she recalled that Latvia has a \"history of occupation\". The former Soviet republic regained its independence in 1991.\n\nMezaine's location is symbolic. During the Cold War, it was home to the Skrunda-1 radar station, whose two large installations were to alert the Soviet Red Army in the event of a missile attack from the West.\n\nNow the area is used for, among other things, urban guerrilla training.\n\n4,000 applications\n\nCreated in 1991, the national guard is the largest component of armed forces in the country of 1.85 million people.\n\nMade up of some 9,600 volunteers, it is divided into four brigades. The national army meanwhile has around 6,000 professional soldiers.\n\nThe guard's commander-in-chief Egils Lescinskis hailed the \"great increase\" in volunteer interest and said fewer people were dropping out.\n\nHe said they had received around 4,000 applications since the beginning of 2022, up from around 1,000 candidates on average each year.\n\nAround 20 percent of the volunteers this year are women.\n\nThe volunteers take part in 21 days of basic training, usually spread over seven weekends, after which they are ready to serve when called up.\n\n#photo1\n\nOn a recent Saturday, around 30 volunteers armed with rifles in camouflage fatigues waited in total silence at the edge of a thick forest.\n\nTheir only communication as they prepared to attack a convoy was through hand gestures or pulling on a wire.\n\nWhen the vehicle arrived, the burst of heavy gunfire was deafening. A few seconds later, a car horn pierced through the air.\n\nThe driver, head against the wheel, played dead.\n\n'Protect our loved ones'\n\nTraining includes \"everything from basic survival to understanding what is war,\" said recruit Rudolfs Aboltins.\n\n\"How to take up arms or even how to present yourself or talk to people, how to engage with unexpected situations in society as well as in combat,\" he added.\n\nLike Danosa, Aboltins joined the guard after the invasion.\n\nAlthough he felt no immediate threat to Latvia, the \"atrocities\" in Ukraine mean \"what I'm doing right now could matter in the future\", he said.\n\n\"Many of us have pacifist tendencies. We took arms and started learning to shoot because we want to be able to protect our loved ones,\" he told AFP.\n\n#photo2\n\nAfter basic training, he will take part in a specialised course to improve communication between civilians and troops.\n\nOthers who wish can also specialise in areas such as anti-tank warfare, medical aid or train to become snipers.\n\n\"My wife said at least one family member needs to join and get some basic skills,\" said 35-year-old entrepreneur and father-of-two Juris Kukulis.\n\n\"So if something happens, we know what to do.\"\n\n© 2022 AFP",

    "48 road deaths in eight months of this year in Latvia": "The results of a survey conducted this year show that nearly a quarter or 24% of drivers say they have undergone risky overtaking maneuvers.

    "Religion in Latvia: the Lutherans of Lestene": "The Reformation arrived in Latvia in 1522, bringing with it fanatical vandalism of ornate church interiors deemed as idolatrous. But within a few generations, beauty was once again seen as pleasing to the Almighty.\n\nAnd in this spirit, in 1700, Baron Karl Friedrich von Fircks decided to add a lavish Baroque interior to a modest country church in Lestene, 70 kilometers west of Rīga. To this end, he hired Ventspils woodcarver Nikolass Sefrenss the Younger who spent the next decade creating a timber masterpiece that has no equal in Latvia.\n\nPulpit of Lestene Lutheran church Photo: Philip Birzulis\n\nAn elaborate pulpit and a towering 10.5 meter high altar retable were alive with Biblical saints and symbols from nature. The organ decking included moving angels, a three-dimensional show which so impressed worshipping peasants that they are said to have cried out “Ak, svētā Lestene!” (Oh, holy Lestene!) upon seeing it.\n\nSefrenss perished from the plague in 1710, and the job of painting and gilding the objects wasn’t completed for several more decades. Then the church enjoyed two centuries of peaceful splendor.\n\nHowever, in the final months of the Second World War, as western Latvia was ravaged by the battles of the Courland Pocket, the church steeple burned down. The building’s structural integrity was preserved, but the interior faced a mortal threat in the post-war years. Ordered by local communist officials to destroy the priceless artworks, some of the pieces being hidden by the local school principal at her workplace. When she was threatened, they were spirited to the attic of the Academy of Art in Riga, where once again communist functionaries raised their ugly heads.\n\nAnother group of sculptures was taken to another Kurzeme church for safekeeping. But as bad luck would have it, right at that time that refuge was used as a movie set, and the film crew inadvertently destroyed many of the items.\n\nEventually, the administrators of Rundāle Palace had the courage to pick up the pieces which could be saved and deposit them in their vast basement. Which was fortunate, as in the 1960s a granary was installed in the church, erasing what was left of the old grandeur.\n\n“Many cultural monuments in Latvia were being destroyed at the time, and Rundāle was like a lifeboat,” says Inguna Kokina, the lay head of church’s parish council.\n\nIn a sense, she muses, it was good that the local collective farm decided to use the building, as other churches had simply been razed to the ground in officially sanctioned campaigns of atheistic violence.\n\nIndeed, there had been plans to dynamite Lestene’s church, but there weren’t enough explosives to deal with its two-meter-thick walls.\n\nLestene Lutheran church interior Photo: Philip Birzulis\n\nInguna’s grandmother worked for the barons before the war, and she herself recalls playing inside the church as a child. And for several decades she has been in the midst of efforts to bring it back to life.\n\nIn the early 2000s, a war cemetery was installed next door to bring together the many scattered graves of Latvian soldiers who died fighting in the Courland Pocket as part of the German-uniformed Latvian Legion. And after that weighty task was completed, Inguna says that a group of activists decided it was a shame to have the church in such a sorry state next to this place of remembrance.\n\nBeginning in 2011, the surviving parts of the pulpit and altar retable were returned to Lestene. Surviving figures from the ensembles have been rejuvenated and missing pieces have been created anew by skilled artisans, based on photographs from the 1930s.\n\nThe craftsmen often work for very modest fees out of their passion for the project. But the cost of materials means it doesn’t come cheap. State culture funds are elusive, Inguna sighs, as the officials in charge have repeatedly said that other sites have priority.\n\nBut the work continues as private donations trickle in. Once the elements now in place have been finished, the mighty organ setting will be brought back from Rundāle, completing the resurrection of this unique monument.\n\nSunday services are held fortnightly by a clergyman who covers a number of rural parishes around Tukums County. On average only about ten worshippers turn up each time (although pre-Covid Christmas events attracted a full house).\n\nAccording to Inguna, this is partly due to the shifting demographics of Lestene. Due to wartime devastation, many locals moved away, and they were replaced by immigrants from Latgale and other parts of the former USSR. Fourteen nationalities reside in the area, and although most are well integrated, there is a lack of historical continuity.\n\nStill, Inguna says that the regular parishioners are a tight-knit group. And the community of supporters of the church stretches around the world.\n\nNeed to know\n\nThe best time to see inside the church is during Sunday services.

    "All to fight for with one week until Saeima elections in Latvia": "Asked which way they would vote if Saeima elections were held tomorrow, 1,825 Latvian citizens of voting age gave Prime Minister Krišjānis Kariņš' New Unity (JV) top spot with 13.3%, almost double the opposition Greens and Farmers Union (ZZS) with 7.8 %. They take second place despite having as their Prime Ministerial candidate Aivars Lembergs – a man sent to prison for five years and sanctioned by the United States.\n\nThird place is held by the right-of-center National Alliance (NA) on 7.3%, followed by the relatively new United List (AS) on 5.4%, which is made up of various smaller parties in an alliance that gives them more critical mass. Harmony (S), which describes itself as a social democrat party, is next with 5.1%.\n\nPhoto: Latvijas Televīzija\n\nIn sixth and seventh place are two liberal-oriented parties the Progressives (P) on 4.9% and For Development/For! (A/P!) on 3.6%.\n\nNo other parties make it across the 5%-of-the-vote threshold required to win seats in the Saeima, though several parties are hovering just below that level. Thus anything from 7 to 12 parties might constitute the next Saeima. There are 19 parties contesting the election in all. For more information on them, see our earlier series of features, and for a full run-down of how the elections work in Latvia, we can offer this.\n\nPhoto: Latvijas Televīzija\n\nHowever, it should be noted that a significant portion of the electorate remains uncommitted as yet. 10.4% of those surveyed said they had no intention of voting at all and nearly a quarter (23.7%) said they remained undecided, so candidates will have plenty to fight over during the next seven days, and it would be no surprise to see the popularity of parties in the final voting tallies differ considerably from the pre-election polls.\n\nIn an additional question about how motivated to vote people were, SKDS and LTV obtained the following data: 37% of people said they would definitely vote, 33% said they would probably vote, 13% said they would probably not vote and 10% said they would definitely not vote. 7% were unable even to decide on this question.",

    "Latvia exposes NATO’s sham victory against Russia": "The Zelensky regime seems to be overjoyed by their recent supposed counteroffensive against the Russians. To tell you the truth, Moscow’s recent retreat on the battleground in some areas of Ukraine has been misunderstood to be Putin’s weakness.\n\nStill, it looks like NATO was indeed overjoyed by the development until Putin cleared his motive behind the war and now the baltic state Latvia has solidified the Russian’s position of strength.\n\nLatvia Knows Moscow better than the west\n\nThe Latvian cabinet recently approved suggestions from the Defense Ministry concerning the creation of the State Defense Service which will be responsible to oversee the annual military service.\n\nYou see, the Latvian’s proximity to the Russian megastate has enabled them to gather better intelligence than any of the western states. And the Latvians know that Moscow is far too big of a power to just back out of the war. The Latvian leaders knew that the whole development must be nothing but a part of a larger strategy inculcated by the Russians.\n\nWell, the doubts were soon enough cleared by Putin. In a rare address to the nation, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that the decree concerning partial mobilization of its 2 million-strong military reserves has been signed as the war in Ukraine reaches its seventh month.\n\nThe decision, which Putin said was taken “to defend the motherland, its sovereignty and territorial integrity” is being viewed as an escalatory move by the West.\n\nPutin had initiated the military operation with the aim of liberating the oppressed people of Donbass. And now when the region is under complete Russian control, Putin plans to pull back the regular army and replace it with conscripts to maintain peace in the liberated regions and continue defending the territory if Ukraine launches a ‘counter-offensive’ against the ethnic Russian populace.\n\nThe Baltics Know that NATO is unreliable\n\nYou see, other NATO members like Poland and Hungary are just now coming to consensus with the realities of NATO. The alliance’s leaders have not been instrumental in protecting the interests of its members and have instead used them to carry out their own personal agendas.\n\nThe USA and Germany have extended unparalleled pressure on Poland to support Ukraine militarily. Although, Poland was not reimbursed for the support it was offered by Germany after Warsaw sent its essential military equipment to support Kyiv. The unapologetic refusal by Germany triggered the leaders of Poland who soon started taking anti-EU stands.\n\nHungary, on the other hand, has long taken an opposing stand and also refused to condemn Russia for its military operation and has continued with its energy deals with Russia.\n\nAlthough the Baltic nations know the capacities of the Russian defense system and had previously come to a consensus the west will not come to aid in the event of an escalation by Moscow.\n\nLatvia has so far been the only Baltic state where conscription has not been undertaken since 2007, it resumed in 2015 in Lithuania, and has continued uninterrupted since the 1990s in Estonia.\n\nThe current defense budget of Latvia is €758 million (2% of GDP). The establishment of the State Defense Service will be financed from the growing funds for defense, which would now reach 2.5% of GDP over the next three years.",
    "Destination: Latvia": "BY EKATERINA KRONGAUZ\n\nIldar, 35; Zhenya, 28\n\nIldar greeted the New Year of 2022 with his partner, Zhenya, a dog, and two cats in their apartment in Moscow. Two years earlier they had moved to Moscow from Noyabrsk (a city of 100,000 people 3,000 kilometers from Moscow), and in the fall of 2021 they took out a fifteen-year mortgage for 7 million rubles (U.S. $100,000) with a $1,200 monthly payment, and bought their first apartment. They made some repairs and celebrated the New Year in their new home.\n\n\n\nIldar (left) and Zhenya on a walk Image Credit\n\n\n\nCourtesy of Ildar\n\nThe move to Moscow happened spontaneously. Ildar had studied as a sound engineer at the Moscow Institute in absentia, working remotely for a podcast studio. Zhenya had her own business in Noyabrsk, a plus-size women's fashion clothing store, which she ran jointly with her mother.\n\n“I never wanted to leave. I have always resisted it at all stages of our life. I don't like stepping out of my comfort zone. And I didn’t want to leave because I don’t know a single foreign language,” says Ildar.\n\nWhen the war began, Zhenya became very ill.\n\nZhenya was born in Ukraine. Her family is from Ukraine, and her grandmother was still living in the city of Dobropolye, Donetsk oblast—currently a Russian-occupied territory.\n\n“Every day we talked with my grandmother,” she says. “We packed a bag for her in case of emergency. The neighbors cleared out the basement, and we rehearsed with her over the phone going to the basement. But in the end, we managed to persuade my grandmother to go west.”\n\nThe idea to leave Russia came to Zhenya first in 2014, the year the Crimean Peninsula was annexed by Russia. Zhenya told Ildar, “All your doubts are garbage! Let’s go to Holland,” but Ildar didn’t want to leave then.\n\n“I began to look up information on Georgia on Google—everyone was talking about Georgia,” Ildar recounts. “Visas were not needed. Living was cheap. I could not discuss this with Zhenya; she was in some kind of coma. I now understand that we generally had very little contact then. She sat and read the news on Telegram all day long.” At that moment, Ildar was afraid of a new iron curtain and the mobilization of all men; this was what scared posters on the Telegram channel. And Ildar began to discuss with Zhenya leaving Russia.\n\nIldar did not discuss the war or leaving Russia with his parents. “They live in a village in Bashkiria. And we didn't talk much. When I visited them, Solovyov”—a popular propagandist state TV host—“was on all the time. At the beginning of the war, my mother sent me some playful poems about poor Mother Russia, how the West kept pecking at her. I tried to explain my position to her, and she hung up. Several times I tried to talk to her, but she abruptly turned off her phone. I hadn’t seen this before—we don’t hang up on each other in our family.”\n\nThrough work acquaintances, Ildar and Zhenya learned that they could get a humanitarian visa to stay in Lithuania (Ildar is working on several sociopolitical podcasts). And Zhenya and Ildar decided to go. Ildar changed all their money at an insane rate (he managed to get a little more than €6,000), and agreed with a friend that he could rent their apartment for $250. Ildar also lined up more work for himself. “When I'm worried, I always load up on work. First, it helps not to think. Second, in this way I can calm my fears about money.”\n\nWhile the visas and all the documents for two cats and a dog were being processed, Zhenya went to Noyabrsk to say good-bye to everyone. A week before leaving, Zhenya asked Ildar if he was going to say good-bye to his parents and if he understood that he might not see them for a very long time. So Ildar went: five hours one way and five hours return.\n\n“I called them and said I would come. When I arrived, they were horrified. They thought something terrible had happened, that perhaps I was getting divorced. I said, “But what I told you doesn’t scare you?!”\n\n\n\nIldar, pictured with his cat Image Credit\n\n\n\nCourtesy of Ildar\n\nAs they started talking, Ildar realized that his assumptions had been wrong: “They understand everything. They understand that something bad is happening. They just think that you shouldn‘t raise your head or open your mouth.” His mother told Ildar that she was getting rid of the phones because she was afraid that they would be tapped and that Ildar would talk too much on the phone and would be arrested.\n\nThe family had never talked much about their past, but Ildar remembers some conversations: a great-grandmother and great-grandfather had been dispossessed, possibly even killed. Whether someone in the family was imprisoned Ildar does not know either, but his mother was afraid this might happen, and afraid for Ildar. “I re-posted a lot in the early days [of the war] on my social media. I remember now that I was a little afraid then. I edit various podcasts, and there were audio diaries of people in Ukraine during the bombings. It was already forbidden to say the word “war,” but all these criminal articles about discrediting the army did not yet exist. Of course, my mother was also afraid for me. But we had a good good-bye. We went to the banya with Dad,” says Ildar.\n\nOn April 29, Ildar’s father-in-law came down to Moscow and loaded into the car one suitcase each for Ildar and Zhenya, two electric guitars, two cats and a dog, and a friend who was also going to Riga, and together they made their way to the Russian-Estonian border. He dropped them off at 8 a.m., and with their suitcases, guitars and pets, Ildar and Zhenya tried to cross the border.\n\nThey were turned back. “It turned out that a humanitarian visa was not enough for us. We needed an additional letter saying that we were entering by invitation, an entry permit.” It was Easter Sunday, but Ildar managed to get such a letter, print it out, and cross the border at 8 p.m.\n\nIn Latvia\n\nIldar and Zhenya have been living in Latvia for four months on a Lithuanian humanitarian visa. Ildar works for a podcast studio. Zhenya volunteers at the NGO Helping to Leave and helps Ukrainian families from Mariupol who ended up in Russia get to Europe.\n\nIldar and Zhenya had hoped they could stay in Riga, but recently Latvian officials have begun to say that they would neither provide documents to Russian citizens nor renew existing visas.\n\n“I don’t think about anything and I don’t plan anything. We have until April 2023. I know that Zhenya Googles at night about study visas, about Portugal. And there is even an option in Bulgaria,” says Ildar.\n\nThere is another option that Ildar does not want to think about right now. Zhenya can get a Ukrainian passport because her whole family is from Ukraine. And this means that Ildar can also get a Ukrainian passport. But then they would both have to give up their Russian passports, and they would no longer be able to visit their parents in Russia.\n\nBut with a Ukrainian passport it is easier to get European documents. It would also be possible for Zhenya alone to acquire a Ukrainian passport, and then either Zhenya's documents or Ildar’s could be used, but Ildar does not want this. Nor does Ildar want to return to Russia, or even visit.\n\n“I don't know, I don't understand. It seems to me that no one needs me, and no one is looking for me. But I don't want to check. And I don’t want to think about all this.”\n\nThe opinions expressed in this article are those solely of the author and do not reflect the views of the Kennan Institute.",
    "At Latvia's border with Russia, the line grows long, and tempers short": "At Latvia's border with Russia, the line grows long, and tempers short\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Rob Schmitz/NPR Rob Schmitz/NPR\n\nTEREHOVA, Latvia — The road carrying a mile-long stream of semi-trucks waiting to enter Russia from Latvia is lined with port-a-potties and dumpsters full of junk-food wrappers and empty caffeinated soda bottles. The wait to get through this border crossing takes around two days.\n\n\"You should have seen this line two months ago,\" recalls Belarusian trucker Dmitri, who sits in the cab of his truck passing the time watching Russian television. \"There were more than a thousand trucks and it took at least seven days to cross into Russia.\"\n\nDmitri, who doesn't give his last name for fear of being targeted for his opinions, has been idling here for two days, inching toward the front of the line. The mustachioed man in his 50s says he's transporting a trailer full of beer from Germany to Moscow, and he says because his country has aligned with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Moscow's invasion of Ukraine has impacted his work and reputation.\n\n\"I've lost work from this and people treat me worse than before,\" he says. \"I was in Lithuania a few days ago trying to eat at a Ukrainian restaurant there, and they wouldn't let me. They kicked me out and told me to get my food from Putin instead.\"\n\nDmitri says he ate at a restaurant across the street, but the incident stuck with him. \"The leaders behind this war aren't suffering from it,\" he says. \"It's us, the regular people, who have to suffer.\"\n\nLatvia, a member of NATO and the European Union, has pushed for a strong global response to Russia's war in Ukraine. The country's 180-mile border with Russia has become tense as a result. Long lines of trucks at border crossings illustrate the toll economic sanctions against Russia and Belarus have taken, and anxieties among those living along the border are also on the rise.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Katrina Kepule for NPR Katrina Kepule for NPR\n\nSome of those in Latvia are stateless\n\nFarther back in line is Anatoly Chibaterevsky, who's driving 1,000 miles from his home in western Latvia to his brother's funeral in Volgograd, a city in southwest Russia. The 75-year-old has lived in Latvia most of his life. He doesn't say what country he was born in, but explains that his family moved here as part of the Soviet occupation of the country shortly after World War II, and returned after being deported to Siberia for a decade's worth of hard labor in 1949.\n\nWhen Latvia gained independence in 1991, Chibaterevsky was one of tens of thousands of ethnic Russians who were never given Latvian citizenship. He is essentially stateless. He rifles through his suitcase and emerges with his passport, which says \"Latvian noncitizen\" on its burgundy cover.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Rob Schmitz/NPR Rob Schmitz/NPR\n\nHe says he hopes the Russians let him enter. \"They usually let me cross with no problems,\" he says, \"but last time they told me, 'You ran away from Russia, so you're staying in Latvia.'\"\n\nEthnic Russians are a large minority in Latvia\n\nEthnic Russians like Chibaterevsky only make up a quarter of Latvia's population of 2 million, but they're the norm in the towns along the eastern border, where many of them speak Russian and identify with Russia. And up until recently, they got much of their information about the world from Russian TV.\n\n\"Russian channels are now blocked and since Russia has been declared the aggressor, we just follow orders and watch what we're being ordered to watch,\" says Nadezhda Kravchenko, who lives in the Latvian border town of Zilupe.\n\nWhen asked how Russia's war in Ukraine is affecting her, she says Latvia has no power over the situation, that it's none of her business, and then walks away without saying another word.\n\nNearly everyone NPR approached in Zilupe was hesitant to talk about the war.\n\n\"Everyone is afraid to tell you what they really think, but I'm not,\" says Jurijs, a 65-year-old pensioner who says he's not scared to talk about the war, but doesn't give his last name for fear of being targeted by authorities.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Katrina Kepule for NPR Katrina Kepule for NPR\n\nHe says he watches both Russian and Latvian news and he's decided the Latvian side is propaganda. \"Ukrainians are fascists and the U.S. gives them weapons,\" he complains, repeating talking points from Russian state TV. \"Russia has liberated them, but they continue to plant land mines and bomb kindergartens and hospitals. Why is Ukraine doing this?\"\n\nLatvian authorities are cracking down on public support of Russia, and that's why Jurijs says nobody here wants to openly talk about the war. \"They can put you in jail for that,\" he says. \"But I'm old. Let them put me in jail for supporting Russia. When Russia invades, they'll come and liberate me.\"\n\nSome Russian-speakers seem to be changing their views on the war\n\nA poll taken earlier this year by Latvian research firm SKDS showed only 25% of Latvians who spoke Russian at home sympathize with the Ukrainian side in the war, while 83% of Latvian speakers supported Ukraine. In another poll conducted by the same firm, 36% of Russian-speakers in Latvia believed that Russia was fighting \"Naziism\" in Ukraine, a narrative pushed by Russian state television, while just 6% of Latvian speakers believed the same to be true.\n\n\"What we know from surveys done before the Russian invasion of Ukraine is that a majority of Russian speakers in Latvia actually had favorable views regarding Russia and Putin,\" says SKDS Executive Director Arnis Kaktins. \"The reason for that is quite a large part of this population lived in the Russian information field, and we know it is very specific, distorted propaganda, and inevitably you are going to believe it and start to think the same way.\"\n\nKaktins says the polls his firm have taken since the war began show an increasing number of Russian-speaking Latvians changing their views to a more nuanced and critical stance on Russian state narratives. Kaktins says young Russian-speaking Latvians tend to be the most critical of Russia's government.\n\nA Ukrainian seeks a roundabout route to the Donbas\n\nBack at Latvia's Terehova border crossing, cars inch forward toward Russia. Among them is the Toyota SUV of Natalia Kononenko, who never thought she'd be here. She's Ukrainian, and she's driven nearly 1,000 miles from Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, where she's been staying, as her home region of Donetsk in the eastern part of her country is being fought over by Russian and Ukrainian troops. Her son, a young student, is stuck there.\n\n\"There's talk that the Russians will take over the rest of our region and then we'll have to make a decision to be on one or other side,\" she says. \"But until now, no one is forcibly taking us anywhere.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Rob Schmitz/NPR Rob Schmitz/NPR\n\nAnd that's why Kononenko is on a rescue mission to pull her son out of the Donetsk region. Instead of driving a few hundred miles through the fighting on the front line and risking getting killed, she's driving thousands of miles, circumnavigating Ukraine, so that she can approach Donetsk from Russia, a journey that'll take several days.\n\nShe's praying that the Russian border guards will allow her into the country. \"There shouldn't be a problem, but we don't know,\" she says with a nervous grin. \"We'll just keep on driving and hope for the best.\"\n\nBehind her in the line is Anatoly Chibatersvsky, the Latvian noncitizen who's also hoping to get to the other side. \"There are benefits to being a noncitizen,\" he concedes. \"With my passport I don't have to buy visas for the EU nor for Russia.\"\n\nHe says even his children who are eligible for Latvian citizenship have opted to be like him and remain stateless. In today's world of national allegiance and the wars fought over it, he says being stateless is, in some ways, a relief.",
    "Police in Latvia dismantle major money laundering group": "Latvian State Police has dismantled a criminal group that provided professional money laundering services in the country using a network of more than 90 «money mules».\n\nIn February 2022 Latvian State Police Department of Cyber Crimes commenced criminal proceedings after receiving information from a Latvia-based credit institution that noticed systematic fraudulent payment activity on accounts of some of its clients.\n\nInformation acquired in the investigation indicates that there was a wide network of «money mules» in Riga, which consisted of youngsters aged 16 to 20 years, who received flash payments on their accounts. These payments mostly came from German citizens. Money from those accounts were then rapidly withdrawn in cash. In most cases this was done around midnight.\n\nVictims say that upon finding their accounts emptied usually tried to call off the transactions made during the night on the next day. However, considering that organisers of this criminal group ensured money was immediately taken from the «money mule’s» account, only a small number of victims were able to intercept and recover the stolen money.\n\nData analysis reveals that around 30 such crimes were committed in a single month. According to authorities, this criminal group may have been active in Latvia since September 2019.\n\nLatvian police performed numerous investigation-related activities to put a stop to the criminal group and identify the suspects. In to months efforts resulted with success.\n\nThe investigation revealed the criminal group consisted of 14 members. One of them was a citizen of Germany. This person coordinated the group from Germany. The organiser had recruiters look for «money mules» with bank accounts in Latvia. The group used these people to receive and move illegally acquired money.\n\nMoney withdrawn from «money mules» was then given away in the form of virtual currency.\n\nFollowing directions from organisers, members of the group also distributed acquired money among themselves. Money mules were paid 50 to 250 euros for their services if they participated in activities multiple times. This way the criminal group was able to launder more than EUR 555 600.\n\nIn April 2020 police detained 13 members of this group.\n\nAmong those detained individuals were also the leaders of the criminal group. Both were put under arrest.\n\nThe leader of the group was detained in Germany in May 2022 thanks to a European arrest warrant, which was issued as a result of long international cooperation between law enforcers of different countries. The German citizen was detained and later arrested after a number of several searchers, interrogations and special investigative activities. Germany extradited him to Latvia for criminal prosecution in summer 2022.\n\nIn August 2022 Latvian police handed criminal proceedings to the Specialized Prosecution Office for Organised Crime and Other Branches to commence criminal prosecution.\n\nConsidering the large number of youngsters that agreed to assist the criminal group by becoming «money mules», State Police stresses to society that such actions carry criminal liability.\n\nPeople who agree to become a «money mule» have to keep in mind that they will not only face criminal liability, but will also experience difficulties for the remainder of their lives because banks close down such people’s access to their bank accounts and access to internet banking services.",

The burial event will continue the whole day. Service will be held at Martin’s Evangelical Lutheran Church, followed by a burial at the nearby Martin Cemetery and opening of a monument at RSU Anatomy and Anthropology Institute.\n\nA total of 14 urns containing ashes will be buried.\n\n«The anatomy institute currently has 28 remains. They are used for educational and scientific purposes. However, 2 154 people’s remains have been dissected in 100 years of the institute’s history,» says the author of this event and director of RSU Anatomy and Anthropology Institute, Prof. Māra Pilmane.\n\nShe stresses that dissecting is an important part of medical training: «Every person is unique and individual. Although plastic or digital 3D models are already part of medical education, they cannot convey a full picture of each person’s uniqueness! The word’s leading universities openly admitted at the Congress of International Federation of Associations of Anatomists in 2004 that it is necessary to return to dissecting real bodies during medical students’ training. The number of people who donate their bodies to medicine and science after death is unknown – this information is protected by the law. Nevertheless, our estimates suggest the number is not small,» says Prof. Pilmane.\n\nMemorial event will start off at 10:00 a.m. with a service at Martin’s Evangelical Lutheran Church in Riga, Slokas Street 34. The service will be attended by priests representing Catholic, Lutheran, Orthodox and Baptist confessions. At 11:00 a.m. a burial procession to the nearby Martin Cemetery will commence.

Details will be announced in the coming days.\n\nFinal decisions will be made at the national level and will come into force at the same time, the foreign minister said. Rinkēvičs added that he expects the measures to apply within the next 10 days.\n\nFinland, which has cut the issuance of tourist visas to Russians to 10 percent of applications, won't restrict all Russians who are traveling on Schengen visas until a decision is made at the EU level.\n\n\"We are also expecting that the Commission ... might make a recommendation on the European level, because unfortunately, Finland and Helsinki airport has become one of the transit routes for people who are then flying to Greece or Spain or Italy,\" Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto said Wednesday.\n\n\"It's very important that on the EU level, we tackle this problem,\" he added.\n\nThe move from the Baltic countries comes a day after the European Commission officially backed a proposal to suspend the EU's 2007 visa agreement with Moscow in retaliation for Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe issue of a ban on Russian visas has caused friction between European capitals. Countries including the Baltics, Finland and the Czech Republic pushed for a full travel ban, as senior officials in Kyiv have demanded; while others led by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz opposed such a step, arguing that it would also stop Russian dissidents and critics of Putin's war from entering the EU.",

    "UEFA President backs Latvia stadium project | Inside UEFA": "During his two-day visit, Mr Čeferin held talks with members of the Latvian government and senior civic dignitaries, and had fruitful discussions with the president of the Latvian Football Federation (LFF), Vadims Ļašenko.\n\nThe UEFA President was also present at a meeting at Riga’s City Council premises on Thursday where Mr Ļašenko and the Mayor of Riga, Mārtiņš Staķis, signed a protocol of intent for the construction of a national football stadium in the capital.\n\nThe UEFA President shakes hands with the Mayor of Riga, Mārtiņš Staķis LFF\n\nMr Staķis highlighted three possible locations in Riga where the stadium could be built. Further decisions will be made by the members of the Riga City Council, and the actual construction of the stadium could begin in the next few years.\n\nUEFA backing for national stadium plan\n\nMr Čeferin visited the potential sites for a national stadium and promised UEFA’s support for the project. “While visiting Latvia, I can see improvements in the football infrastructure,” he reflected, “but Latvia still needs a national football stadium. And this is not what I think … it is what I know.”\n\nVadims Ļašenko showed the UEFA President potential national stadium sites in Riga LFF\n\n“I feel that there is understanding and positive energy among the decision-makers,” he added. “I don't see this as a political issue because every major political entity should support the creation of such a sports infrastructure.”\n\n“We are ready to get involved with funding in the implementation of this project,” the UEFA President continued. “However, all the resulting decisions and details are on the side of the LFF, the municipality and other possible partners.”\n\nThe projected national stadium would potentially host not only top-level football matches and other sporting occasions, but also large-scale cultural events – increasing the growth potential of tourism in Riga and elsewhere in Latvia.\n\nTalks at the LFF headquarters LFF\n\n“It must be understood that this is a long-term process,” added Vadims Ļašenko, who described the protocol of intent for the national stadium as “an historic document that will allow us to continue our work on a very important issue for the development of Latvian football.”\n\n“Today, a big step forward has been taken,” the LFF President added, while expressing his gratitude to UEFA for its constant invaluable support and cooperation. “It is not only financial, but also involves a lot of help in other matters,” he explained.\n\nUEFA’s football development help to Latvia\n\nOn Wednesday, the UEFA President, together with Mr Ļašenko, met Latvia’s minister of education and science, Anita Muižniece, at the LFF headquarters, as well as the mayor of the city of Liepāja, Gunārs Ansiņš.\n\nAleksander Čeferin met Latvia’s minister of education and science, Anita Muižniece LFF\n\nAnita Muižniece thanked UEFA and the LFF for their significant contribution to the development of Latvian football, which is being aided in its progress through funding provided by the European body’s HatTrick project. She emphasised that football is the most popular sport in Latvia and welcomed the UEFA President's viewpoint on a national football stadium.\n\nIndoor halls programme\n\nDuring Mr Čeferin’s visit, the UEFA President was also briefed about the construction of an inflatable football hall in Liepāja.\n\nBuilding work has been undertaken with the help of UEFA funding, and is part of an ambitious nationwide indoor football halls construction programme being implemented by the LFF in cooperation with local municipalities.\n\nAleksander Čeferin with the mayor of the city of Liepāja, Gunārs Ansiņš LFF\n\nGunārs Ansiņš thanked the LFF and UEFA for implementing the inflatable hall project in Liepāja. The city’s mayor underlined the project’s importance as a way of keeping children playing football during the winter period. He explained that, on account of the winter weather conditions in Liepāja, children often chose other sports during the winter, with some not returning to football in the spring.\n\nKey football investments\n\nThanks in no small part to the HatTrick funding contribution provided by UEFA, the LFF has been able to make various recent investments in the improvement of football and sports infrastructure in Latvia.\n\nMr Čeferin was greeted in Riga by youngsters from the JDFS Alberts club LFF\n\nThese have included the construction of dozens of artificial football pitches; improvements to the Daugava Stadium in Liepāja; provision of field maintenance equipment; the construction of automatic watering systems and other vital LFF football infrastructure support programme projects.\n\nLater on Thursday, the UEFA President concluded his visit to Latvia when he attended the national men’s team’s UEFA Nations League League D Group 1 match against Moldova at Riga’s Skonto Stadium.",

    "Latvian government to develop more support measures for residents during energy crisis": "On Thursday, 22 September, Latvia’s Saeima asked the government to develop additional measures to support residents during upcoming heating season and reduce the impact from growing energy prices.\n\nThe Saeima gave the Cabinet of Ministers a month to develop and present appropriate proposals for measures to take in order to overcome the crisis caused by growing energy resource prices.\n\nAdditional support is necessary due to the rapid increase of energy resource prices, especially for natural gas, and the negative effect this has on manufacturing costs across all segments, competitiveness of the national economy and household expenses, as reported by Saeima’s press-service.\n\nThe parliament’s decision also mentions that in order to secure at least partial energy resource price compensation it is necessary to immediately increase state support.\n\nUntil now the planned support to compensate rising heating costs was EUR 350 million, which is now considered insufficient. On top of that, it will reach a small portion of residents, as previously outlined by deputies during a meeting of the government and municipal committees. Representatives of multiple municipal councils also expressed concerns about the upcoming heating season.\n\nThe government has allocated funding from the budget programme for emergencies in order to provide residents of pension age, disabled residents and survivors between 1 November and 31 December.\n\nBenefits will be paid in the following amounts:\n\nEUR 30 a month if pension, benefit or state social insurance benefit amount or their total does not exceed EUR 300 a month;\n\nEUR 20 a month if pension, benefit or state social insurance benefit amount or their total is between EUR 301 to EUR 509 a month;\n\nEUR 10 a month if pension, benefit or state social insurance benefit amount or their total is between EUR 510 to EUR 603.\n\nIf a person receives too much than what is allowed, digits after the comma are left out.\n\nFor example, if the old age pension amount is EUR 300.94, the cents after the comma us left out and the person is paid a benefit of EUR 30 a month.\n\nThe total state benefit payment period is set between 1 November 2022 and 31 May 2023. The funding necessary to afford the payment of state benefits will be clarified in the State Budget Project for 2023 and the Medium-term Budget for 2023, 2024 and 2025 legislative drafts.\n\nThis state benefit will be paid to people living in Latvia who are paid old age, disability or survivor pension, as well as early and advance pension.\n\nThe benefit will be paid to recipients of loss of capacity for work or survivors’ compensation and recipients of state social security benefits.\n\nThe state benefit of EUR 30 will be paid to persons who are recipients of the supplement to the state family allowance for a child with disabilities; persons of legal age who are granted refugee or alternative status in the Republic of Latvia and who are legally residing in the Republic of Latvia with a valid residence permit or temporary residence permit issued by the Republic of Latvia, and who have reached the age specified in the Law on State Pensions.\n\nPayment of state benefits will start in November, as reported by Ministry of Welfare.",
    "OF CLEARCUTS and BIRDS #4": "If left to nature, Latvia would be almost entirely covered by forests. Most Latvian forests are classified as ‘modified natural’ or ‘semi-natural’ forests. These are made up of native tree species, though they may have been thinned or even planted, and have some of the characteristics of undisturbed natural forests.\n\nWhile the total area classified as “forest” has remained stable or has even slightly increased (depending on the data source), the actual tree cover has declined. 86.4% of Latvian forests are primarily managed for timber production, with clearcuts as the main practice in the final “harvest”. This has dire impacts on forests, birds,and biodiversity. Let’s hear the stories of our local colleagues.\n\nA LITTLE BACKGROUND IN LATVIAN FORESTRY\n\nAccording to Global Forest Watch, Latvia is the second European country and the 20th in the world with the highest loss of relative tree cover from 2001 to 2021. Carbon sequestration in forests has been declining due to increasing harvesting levels. Since the 90s, the national forest carbon sinks have been reduced by two-thirds. This has a direct consequence on climate, as carbon sinks from Land Use Change and Forestry sector (LULUCF) swing to a net carbon source.\n\nThe Baltic region is known as one of the world’s largest outputs of wood pellets. Latvia remains one of the largest producers in the region with an output of around 1.6 million tonnes in 2018 and 2019. The country supplies by itself at least 23% of the Dutch consumption of wood pellets.\n\nSHARE OF PROTECTED FORESTS IN Latvia 2019 (Source):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLOGGING VOLUME/YEAR (Source: Source: www.vmd.gov.lv (and for the data before 1996 : Saliņš, Z. 1999. Meža izmantošana Latvijā: vēsture, stāvoklis, perspektīvas. Jelgava: LLU Meža izmantošanas katedra.):\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom 2016 to 2018, the harvested forest areas increased by 32% in Latvia in comparison to the period between 2004 and 2015. Viesturs Kerus, CEO at Latvian Ornithological Society (LOB – BirdLife Latvia), analyses: “Some data sources give the impression that the forest cover in Latvia has increased, but one should beware of what is considered as forest. Knowing that clearcut areas are officially counted as forests, we understand why the total forest area seems to continue to increase… In reality, the area of forest that is older than 20 years is steadily declining since at least 2008.”\n\nOnly 7% of forests are strictly protected in Latvia and partial felling restrictions apply to only 6.6%. Viesturs comments: “With only 11.5%, Latvia has the second lowest coverage of Natura 2000 sites in the EU after Denmark. But even within Natura 2000 sites you will be able to find a lot of clearcuts, as is the case for the Nīcgales meži or Forests of Nīcgale. While one of the conservation goals of this area is the protection of forests, it has been heavily logged during the past 20 years. And this is just one example. However, it is worth designating Natura 2000 areas for forest protection because, though not perfect, they still ensure better protection than outside these territories. “Nīcgales meži” is a bad example but there are also good ones.”\n\nWhat’s more, over 80% of the total final felling – logging oriented to harvest mature trees – takes the form of clearcuts in Latvia, rather than selective logging. Viesturs concludes, “despite all the proof that the state of our forests is worrying, the government of Latvia recently decided to lower the limits for the final felling of pine, spruce and birch forests, which are most of the forests in Latvia. They claim that this will ensure there is enough forest biomass for heating during the war of Russia in Ukraine. Allowing to harvest thinner trees means that younger forests will be cut, as there is a strong relation between forests age and trees size. We expect that this decision will increase logging rates and consequently have dire impacts on forest biodiversity.”\n\nTHE PROTECTION OF FOREST BIODIVERSITY\n\nIn 2019, Latvia and Estonia together exported three million tonnes of wood pellet, made from six million m³ of wood. This is equivalent to 200 km² of clearcut or twice the size of Paris. High demand for wood has affected the last remaining old growth forests in Latvia. But these forests play a crucial role in biodiversity conservation.\n\nViesturs explains: “Old-growth forests are unique biodiversity hotspots. Deadwood, large old trees, trees with cavities and other micro-habitats host a variety of species that cannot survive in actively managed forest landscapes, such as the Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), the Black Stork (Ciconia nigra) and hundreds of species of moss, fungi, and lichen.”\n\n“In Latvia, habitats listed in Annex I of the EU Habitats Directive (see table) have recently been mapped out. But large parts of them are still not designated as Natura 2000 sites, putting the decision of whether or not to log a site in the hand of forest managers. This results in the destruction of valuable habitats all over Latvia.”\n\nThe EU Habitats Directive:\n\nThe Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora aims to promote the maintenance of biodiversity targeting a list of habitats and species. Annex I includes the natural habitat types of community interest whose conservation requires the designation of special areas of conservation.\n\nSince 2015, LOB maintains a breeding bird monitoring scheme, covering about half of all bird species breeding in Latvia. Viesturs explains: “The Hazel Grouse (Bonasa bonasia) population has decreased by 93% between 2005 and 2018. The Hazel Grouse is a resident forest bird species and is listed in the Annex I of Birds Directive. While this bird has suffered from the most dramatic decline, several other forest bird species, like the Common Buzzard (Buteo buteo), the Lesser Spotted Woodpecker (Dryobates minor) or the Willow Tit (Poecile montanus), are also declining.”\n\n“For a set list of species (e.g. Black Stork (Ciconia nigra), Lesser Spotted Eagle (Clanga pomarina) and Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus)) the law in Latvia allows the designation of small protected areas (micro reserves) in breeding sites. We actively make use of this option and thanks to our work many micro reserves have already been successfully designated.”\n\n“But there is still a lot of work to be done,” Viesturs concludes. “Besides working on specific sites, we actively advocate for more sustainable forestry across Latvia. To achieve this, we closely collaborate with other environmental NGOs, in particular with the Latvian Fund for Nature and Pasaules Dabas Fonds. Sadly, preserving the status quo is most often the only result of heavy fights with forestry sector, whose only objective is to have even more intensive forestry in Latvia.”\n\nTHE LESSER SPOTTED EAGLE NESTS DESTROYED BY LOGGING\n\nIt is estimated that around a third of the Lesser Spotted Eagle (Clanga pomarina) population in Europe, and almost a fifth of its world population, breeds in Latvia.. However, the Lesser Spotted Eagle population decreased by about 15% in Latvia since the end of the 90s, followed by some recovery later. The LIFE Project ‘Conservation arrangements for Lesser Spotted Eagle in Latvia’ was led by the Latvian Fund for Nature (LFN), with the partnership of Latvian Ornithological Society. The conclusions were released in 2021.\n\nOver the course of four years, 543 new Lesser Spotted Eagle nests have been found, of which roughly 10 % have been adversely affected by forestry activities. This includes cases of destruction of nesting sites, including felling of nesting trees, or cases where logging is planned without considering the presence of a Lesser Spotted Eagle.\n\nJānis Ķuze, project manager for Latvian Fund for Nature, clarifies: “Currently only 6% of the Latvian Lesser Spotted Eagle population nests inside Natura 2000 territories. Thereby micro-reserves are the most suitable conservation tool to protect their breeding sites as well as other dispersedly nested bird species in Latvia. The essence of the problem is that there are no mandatory assessments in place to identify the nature values of forests before felling them. They should be put in place like the assessments that exists to identify the economic values of a forest.”\n\nForest stand was logged down during the breeding season of the Lesser Spotted Eagle, which resulted in unsuccessful breeding. By law, it is required to leave the trees with large nests and encircling group of trees in the clear-felled areas although it has a rather limited value. This is illustrated by the aforementioned case, where the nest was left overexposed and was abandoned. Picture taken at the end of the breeding season on 01.09.2018. (Pictures by project LIFE AQPOM, Latvian Fund for Nature)\n\nWhen nests are discovered, protecting them is not easy. “The process of establishing micro-reserves for the protection of nests provoked a sharp reaction from forest owners’ organizations”, details Jānis, “The main objections were that private forest owners do not receive adequate compensation for restrictions on economic activities in micro-reserve territories and they don’t feel sufficiently involved in the establishment process of the reserves.”\n\nWhile the birds are protected on paper, nest trees are still cut every year. Jānis Ķuze concludes, “the data collected during the project on the destroyed nests have been transferred by the Latvian Fund for Nature and the Latvian Ornithological Society to the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Regional Development and the Ministry of Agriculture. Since no action was taken by the state institutions, the Latvian Fund for Nature has prepared and submitted a complaint to the European Commission regarding the violation of the Birds Directive.”\n\nOF\n\nCLEARCUTS\n\n& BIRDS #1 Intro Finland OF\n\nCLEARCUTS\n\n& BIRDS #2 FINLAND Estonia OF\n\nCLEARCUTS\n\n& BIRDS #3 ESTONIA Latvia\n\n\n\nSTOP\n\nBURNING\n\nFORESTS\n\nJoin the action & contact your MEPs\n\nFOLLOW KARL’S JOURNEY ON THE MAP",
    "Successful tourism season this year in Latvia": "In July, the number of foreign tourists in Latvia doubled, compared with a year earlier, according to the Central Statistical Bureau data. The most popular destination is Rīga, which has been visited by nearly 60% of foreign tourists entering Latvia. A total of 16% of tourists have visited Jūrmala, followed by Liepāja, Sigulda, and Ventspils. Most tourists arrived in Latvia from Lithuania and Estonia, followed by Finland and Poland, while the number of tourists coming from Russia is decreasing.\n\nRiga Investment and Tourism Agency representative Ieva Lasmane said that after the war began, a large proportion of tourist group bookings were canceled. Around 60 to 70% of the pre-pandemic number of tourists were served in the capital. Not all hotels resumed work in Rīga this summer.\n\n“Firstly, Mogotel, they have a lot of hotels. In order not to compete with their own hotels, they can choose not to open for a moment. This is not only influenced by the number of tourists, but also by the lack of staff. Tourists from Russia still show up in statistics, which certainly cannot be compared to 2018 or 2019, when the total number of Russian tourists was close to 200,000 per year. On the overall background, however, it has previously been around 10-13%. It is clear that it is very difficult to replace such a large mass at once, but we have invested more resources in the German market, which is a big market. We have a lot of direct flights to different German cities, so it is very easy to get to Rīga. The second of these larger markets is Britain, which has been growing steadily all these years, also with very good airlines and, of course, our close Nordic countries, Scandinavia,” said Lasmane.\n\nMost Russian tourists have been resting in the resort town of Jūrmala until now. In September this year, the Cabinet decided that the entry of citizens of the Russian Federation to Latvia for tourism and recreational purposes was limited. Madara Zahare, the senior expert in the tourism and business department of Jūrmala, said that the largest number of Russian tourists - a quarter of the total number of tourists - visited Jūrmala in 2019, but already last year their number decreased significantly - to 2%, and this year they represent 3% of the total number of tourists.\n\n“It should be noted that Russian citizens have purchased property in Jurmala, as well as when traveling, they tend to stay at relatives, friends, apartments or private apartments that do not provide data to the CSP. Consequently, we assume that, in fact, this number may be higher than that shown by the specific data. The first half of this year, in general, has been more vivid in terms of the number of foreign tourists than, for example, last year, and we have also received feedback from the major hotels in Jurmala for this summer season, that, compared to the previous 2 years, it has been all very good and pleasant, and there were no restrictions,” said Zahare.\n\nSanta Graikste, executive director of the Latvian Association of Hotels and Restaurants, said that there is uncertainty about how tourism will be affected by the high energy prices. Currently, last-minute hotel bookings are carried out by even tourists from Germany who usually did this for 3 or 4 months before the trip.\n\n“For the most successful time in the season, we can talk about July, August, when really the season was what it should be, and some even reported historically best results. Bookings are coming for October, but it is hard to say about November and December because these bookings are made very shortly before. Therefore, it would also be important that with support of the state institutions and industry, there would be the return of major international events, conferences, seminars in Latvia,” said Graikste.\n\nIn the 7 months of this year, 1.2 million foreign and local tourists were served in Latvian tourist accommodation, which is 85% more than during the corresponding period last year but is still nearly 30% less than in 2019.",
    "Universities in Latvia worried about rapidly growing payments for energy resources": "Over the course of next two years the payments for energy resources of many universities in Latvia will have tripled. This is why support from the state is needed, as mentioned in the letter sent by Latvian Association of Universities (LUA) to highest ranking officials and ministries in Latvia.\n\nAccording to principal of Riga Stradins University (RSU), LUA board chairman Aigars Pētersons, in 2023 his university’s costs for heating energy and electricity will be 346% higher when compared to 2021. For Riga Technical University the increase is estimated at 306%.\n\nFor the University of Latvia, excluding institutions under its subordination and supervision and capital associations, the increase of electricity and heating energy costs at the most optimistic scenario is expected to reach 299%, for Daugavpils University it will be 300%, for Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies and Liepaja University it will be 266%.\n\nIncreasing costs present a very serious influence on budgets of universities in Latvia, stressed Pētersons.\n\nUniversities turned to ministries for assistance, but the responses they received were with rejections.\n\nBecause of this they decided to send letters to the president and prime minister.\n\nEducation institutions report having plans to implement energy austerity measures. However, the volume of finances saved from these measures will not match the rise of energy resource prices. It is not expected to secure complete coverage of related costs. LUA also mentions the growing influence of inflation and the residual negative influence left on the quality of the education process by Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nLUA requests adding state-founded universities on the list of recipients of state support to help compensate growing costs and overcome the crisis.",

Because the regular recyclables, such as cardboard and wood, are collected free of charge. It is currently stipulated that organic waste costs should not be higher than 80% of municipal waste rates. This means that recycling biological waste is more beneficial for residents than putting it municipal waste, but it is our opinion that this difference should be even higher. This means that if the organic waste tariff for the population is not more than 60% of the municipal waste tariff, then the population will be more interested in sorting biological waste,” said Ziemelis.\n\nHow much waste is produced, one can see perfectly at the Getliņi landfill, where trees have already grown on the first mountain of garbage. In order to use part of the biodegradable waste for a second time, in the spring of last year, a biodegradable waste recycling complex started work in the waste management company Getliņi Eko. Both technical compost and biogas are produced from biological waste in Getliņi.\n\n“The gas produced is purified and transmitted to the energy unit of Getlini Eko, where electricity and heat are produced. Electricity is used both for internal purposes and is transferred accordingly to the transmission network, while heat is used in greenhouses to grow cucumbers and tomatoes. […] Of course, we are very interested in [making people more sort waste], because it would give us the opportunity to produce more gas, more energy, respectively, but also, the better sorting of waste, the better ways to recycle them and reduce the volume that needs to be stored in a mountain of waste. The waste is given a second life as a really valuable resource,” Dukaļska said.\n\nCurrently, sorting of biodegradable waste has been launched in Riga and in the municipalities of Pierīga, and as of 2023 it will have to be done throughout Latvia.",
    "Medics: Latvia needs 30 million euros to satisfy strike demands": "Preparations of Latvian Health and Social Care Workers’ Trade Union (LVSADA) for the full-scale strike on 27th and 28th September are almost complete. There are also plans to hold a protest outside the Cabinet of Ministers building together with the strike.\n\n«Despite the warning strike scheduled for 27 September, neither the government nor the Saeima have moved a finger to try to prevent the strike,» the trade union reports.\n\nLVSADA softened demands multiple times. The current demands require the government to provide for a partial completion of the government’s written promise of 7 August 2017 in relation to guaranteed pay for healthcare workers this year.\n\n«One of the main problems for Latvia’s healthcare sector is the shortage of workers, and the main cause of this problem is the abnormally low remuneration.\n\nThe European Commission pointed this out to the Latvian government the Saeima on multiple occasions, as did OECD and the World Bank. When they approved the National Development plan 2021-2027, the Saeima stressed the importance of significantly increasing wages of healthcare workers. However, the government led by Krišjānis Kariņš now pretend they know nothing about that or LVSADA’s strike demands. Completion of demands presented by the trade union will require funding of approximately EUR 30 million. When compared to the government’s emergency expenditures, this is a relatively small amount. This time there is no talk about the money. But what then?» the trade union noted in the statement to the press.\n\nLVSADA chairman Valdis Keris concluded: «Although every year Latvia loses thousands of lives that could have been saved if the country had proper funding of its healthcare sector if it had a sufficient number of workers, the government continues spitefully ignoring the issue. Like it or not, we have to conclude the government seems to want to make Latvia into a well-managed cemetery. The trade union does not share this vision. We will fight for Latvian residents’ right to live!»\n\nThe head of LVSADA strike committee, vice-chairperson Līga Bāriņa adds: «The demands of our strike are clear. The objective of our strike is protecting lives – yours and mine! Without doctors there won’t be a Latvia!»\n\nThe final decision regarding the strike will be made by LVSADA at a meeting of the council on 20 September.",
    "Who’s a Latvian and why? A complex question just got harder.": "“To have a strong society ... you should have a common history,” says pollster Arnis Kaktins. “We don’t have that.”\n\nOne focus of discord was the Victory Memorial in the capital, Riga, commemorating the Soviet soldiers who died freeing Latvia from the Nazis. But most Latvians remember better the Soviets’ own 50-year occupation of their land. Last week the authorities toppled the monument, calling it a catalyst for polarization.\n\nRussian Latvians may not be numerous, but they wield potential influence. Most of them are neutral on the Ukraine war, or support Kyiv, but others could cause trouble, officials fear.\n\nThe government is cracking down on the small minority of ethnic Russians who support President Vladimir Putin, and just when dialogue would seem more important than ever, people have largely “closed all the windows and switched off the lights” on discussion of the identity issue, says Deniss Hanovs, a professor of cultural history.\n\nLatvia had been making progress toward the inclusion of its ethnic Russian citizens. But the war in Ukraine has frozen such movement as the government raises its guard against neighboring Russia.\n\nAs they distanced themselves from memories of Soviet occupation, the puzzle seemed to be growing less fraught. But Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine has brought old divisions to the surface.\n\nSince Latvia declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1990, its citizens – a quarter of whom are ethnic Russians – have been wrestling to define their identities.\n\nThe nature of Alice Zvezda’s identity is as challenging to juggle as the infant she’s pushing around a Riga park.\n\n“My husband is Latvian and I am Russian. So I am like, both. I feel myself both,” says Ms. Zvezda as she rocks her baby stroller cradling a next-generation Russian Latvian.\n\nThat kind of dual identity had been growing easier to navigate as Latvians distanced themselves from memories of their country’s 50-year occupation by the Soviet Union that ended in the early 1990s.\n\nWhy We Wrote This Transformation Latvia had been making progress toward the inclusion of its ethnic Russian citizens. But the war in Ukraine has frozen such movement as the government raises its guard against neighboring Russia.\n\nBut it suddenly got harder last February, when Russia invaded Ukraine and the Latvian government began arming itself with words and weapons: It is reinstituting the military draft, excising Russian language from public schools, banning Russian state media from the airwaves, and dismantling Soviet-era memorials.\n\nThe vast majority of Latvians — including a quarter of the country’s Russian speakers —are solidly against the war in Ukraine, but a small and significant segment of the Russian diaspora sympathizes with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Once tolerant of such citizens, the Latvian government is now trying to crack down on their way of thinking, just when Latvian society was making some progress toward inclusion of its multitude of ethnic identities.\n\nIt would seem that dialogue over Latvian identity, a complex construct of language, culture, and nationality, is needed more than ever. But since the war began, people have largely “closed all the windows and switched off the lights” on discussion, says Deniss Hanovs, a Russian Latvian cultural history professor at Riga Stradiņš University.\n\n“The history of Latvia has been so very bloody and full of conflict and tragedy that most people stick to ethnic identity” when they define themselves, says Dr. Hanovs. “But we need to go beyond ethnic identity. One needs to be a citizen. The notion of [a] political nation is the only future for a multiethnic culture in Europe.”\n\nKaren Norris/Staff\n\nA complicated dance\n\nBut that’s a complicated dance today for a society that’s roughly a quarter ethnic Russian. “The younger generation [of ethnic Russians and Latvians] is making families together and we do not have conflict,” explains Ms. Zvezda. “We were hoping when the generations change and the politicians are our age, it will be totally fine – love and understanding. But no, now war came. And it’s splitting the community.”\n\nAbout 150,000 Russian-speaking Latvians sympathize with Russia on the war, polls have found. “That’s a lot for small Latvia,” says Ieva Bērziņa, a researcher on Russian strategy at the National Defense Academy of Latvia.\n\nAnd it leaves open the possibility that the Kremlin might destabilize Latvia using the Russian diaspora. Reaching out to this population through a common language, religion, and historical memory offers Russia an “unparalleled soft power influence to further foreign policies abroad,” in the words of a 2021 report by researchers at the London School of Economics.\n\nDr. Bērziņa found in a 2016 study that Russian influence in Latvia could be “quite huge ... when it comes to war and real-life situations that can catalyze differences within society,” she says. “When it goes out onto the street it’s a huge problem.”\n\nOne of those potential catalysts was the Victory Memorial in Riga, where ethnic Russians congregated every May 9 to celebrate the Soviet Army’s victory over Nazi Germany. (The Soviets liberated Latvia from the Germans but ushered in their own five-decade-long occupation of the country.)\n\nThe authorities last week toppled the main obelisk, saying it risked “polarizing society,” and removed other structures from the memorial complex, in line with the wishes of roughly 75% of Latvian speakers, but against those of the same proportion of Russian speakers, according to a poll by the Latvian polling firm SKDS. It’s a stark divide.\n\n“The monument means different things for Latvians and Russians,” explains Dr. Bērziņa. “For Latvians it’s a symbol of [Soviet] occupation and pain, and for Russian speakers it’s primarily a commemoration of their ancestors who fought against Nazi Germany.”\n\nThis lack of a shared understanding of history hinders progress toward a harmonious Latvian society, says pollster Arnis Kaktins, SKDS’s executive director.\n\n“To have a strong society, one of the pillars is that you should have a common history, and we don’t have that,” he says. “We have two different histories regarding the Second World War – with different beliefs around whether Russia occupied us, or whether they liberated us from the evil fascists.”\n\nLenora Chu Latvian Defense Minister Artis Pabriks poses in his office building in Riga Aug. 2, 2022. Mr. Pabriks says that ethnic Russians who long for the Soviet era's glory days must \"change their way of thinking.\"\n\nUsing Pushkin as a weapon\n\nBut minds are changing, nonetheless. Half of Russian speakers tell pollsters they sympathize with neither Russia nor Ukraine in the war. This group appears to be in transition away from traditional loyalties, says Mr. Kaktins.\n\n“They are confused; they are shocked; they need more time to talk, to understand, and to process what’s actually happening,” he says. “If suddenly something happens which contradicts your worldview of Russia as beautiful and good, you don’t automatically change it in two hours. It is a very slow, gradual process. It takes a long time.”\n\nUntil the Ukraine war began, adds Dr. Hanovs, the Russian Latvian cultural history professor, ethnic Russians had seen their former homeland’s history in a heroic light, symbolized by musicians and poets such as Peter Tchaikovsky and Aleksandr Pushkin. They never associated their culture with evil.\n\n“Now, starting from February, this is part of my own [Russian] identity,” Dr. Hanovs says, explaining that President Putin invaded Ukraine in the name of Russia’s glorious past. “It’s not only Tchaikovsky and Pushkin, but also ‘Pushkin can be used to kill people in Ukraine,’” he says.\n\nLatvia’s defense minister, Artis Pabriks, is losing patience. He is in charge of reinstituting military conscription by 2023, and he insists that Putin supporters must understand that the glory days of the Soviet Union are over.\n\n“How can you tolerate in your country people who are saying, ‘We’re against Parliament and against democracy and against freedom’?” asks Mr. Pabriks during an interview in Riga. “We cannot simply say, ‘Oh yes, you are against an independent Latvia but you’re welcome to walk around.’”\n\nThat hardening attitude indicates how difficult it could be to integrate Latvia without alienating those on the fringes, and without suppressing Russian culture and language.\n\nThe sizable group of Russian speakers who declare themselves patriotic citizens of Latvia might show the way, if the government takes a nuanced approach.\n\n“I hope the Latvian political elite will manage to differentiate between those who are part of Latvia and those who still exist in the past,” Dr. Hanovs says. And some observers believe that the war might actually speed up convergence on a national Latvian identity, as Russians are forced to confront hard facts about their former motherland.\n\nMs. Zvezda, the young Russian Latvian mother living in Riga, harbors more modest hopes – that the growing difficulties of everyday life will push larger questions of war and peace and ethnic identity aside.\n\nGet stories that\n\nempower and uplift daily.

    "Ukraine’s pseudorepublics announce «referendums»; Latvia refuses to recognise legitimacy": "The self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic and Donetsk People’s Republic announced that they will be holding a referendum between 23rd and 27th of September on the addition of their regions to the Russian Federation, as leaders of the self-proclaimed republics Leonid Pasechnik and Denis Pushilin announced on Tuesday, 20 September.\n\nThe Russian occupation administration in Kherson also announced plans to hold a referendum on the same dates.\n\nLatvia’s Prime Minister Krišjānis Kariņš has already announced on social media that Latvia will not recognise the legitimacy of these referendums.\n\n«Putin’s imperialistic ambitions are clear – destroying Ukraine’s independence and subject it to Russia’s direct influence. We must increase support for Ukraine until it wins,» he wrote.\n\nLatvian Minister of Foreign Affairs Edgars Rinkēvičs also suggests the international society must supply more arms to Ukraine so that they can liberate their territories.\n\n«Clearly Russia is moving forward with fake referendums within Ukraine’s occupied territories. The international society must condemn this step, impose more sanctions and supply Ukraine with more arms to let them liberate their territories,» said the minister.\n\nThe head of the Ukrainian president’s office Andrii Yermak calls the referendum a naive blackmail attempt.\n\n«Naive blackmail and horror stories about referendums, mobilisation from those who can only fight against children and civilians. This is how fear of defeat looks like,» he wrote on his Telegram channel.\n\n«The enemy is afraid and uses primitive manipulations. Ukraine will resolve the Russian issue. The only way to prevent a threat is by using force,» he added.\n\nAccording to the head of the Luhansk Regional Military–Civil Administration Serhiy Haidai,\n\nif Russia organises a pseudoreferendum, it will open the way for general mobilisation in Russia.\n\n«They [Russians] can organise fake referendums, put something together sloppily, recognise results. And in accordance with these results they will want to join Russia,» he told Radio Freedom.\n\n«And then the liberation of Ukraine’s occupied Luhansk region will be considered a direct attack on Russia from their perspective. This will allow them to announce general mobilisation and declare war,» Haidai explained.\n\n«Because right now they have big problems with that [mobilisation]. They can’t accumulate a sufficient number of people.»\n\nOn Monday, 19 September, the government of Donetsk and Luhansk regions occupied by Russian forces invited immediately holding referendums on the addition of these regions to Russia’s territory.\n\nUkrainian army continues its counter-offensive in Kharkiv region.\n\nOnly several villages have been liberated in Luhansk so far, but Haidai believes the situation may change very soon.",
    "Restaurants: mass closures expected if state aid does not come": "“This is a farewell letter. August will be the last full month of our operation. Becco is closed in September,” the owners of a popular Italian restaurant in Cēsis wrote on Facebook. The restaurant had been open for four years, surviving through the pandemic. Unwilling to speak in front of the camera, the owners of the pizzeria said in a telephone call that they had received the August bills and realized they were unwilling to get into debt. The doors of Valmiera's popular restaurant, “Vecpuisis,” are also already closed.\n\nOwners of other restaurants do not hide their despair.\n\nThe co-owner of the “Vairāk saules” restaurant chain, chef Endijs Bērziņš said: “I'm telling the story of one restaurant's bill: it used to be €1,800, the war began, and it was €3,500; in June and July, €5,500, and it's just electricity. We understand – it's war, it's hard, okay, forget about profit, hold your breath, go through... The August bill is €9,200. It just wipes off all common sense.”\n\nBērziņš said electricity bills have become “astronomical” despite the fact that consumption has been reduced by around 10% in various ways.\n\nThis example illustrates the situation in the whole sector for which difficult times started during the Covid pandemic. The crisis has deepened due to the war, both because of the scarcity of tourists and the cost of energy resources, but the support mechanisms do not follow. The tax burden on catering services is also not reduced compared to other countries of the European Union.\n\nJānis Hermanis, financial and tax expert of the Latvian Employers' Confederation, said: “The period is very long, and it is dependent on endurance. At some point there may be a serial withdrawal from the game.”\n\nJānis Jenzis, president of the Latvian Restaurant Association, said: \"There are a lot of questions about our competitiveness in the region; if Lithuanian entrepreneurs are more competitive because of this reduced [tax] rate, or Estonians are more competitive because they had [less strict] restrictions of the pandemic, there is a high risk that these entrepreneurs will enter our market because we are in a single, common market. And buy our businesses, which is happening at the moment. \"\n\nThe industry emphasized the need for changes to the tax system, as well as support for households in order to prevent people from completely abandoning the habit of eating outside the house for austerity purposes.\n\nRepresentatives of catering companies are proposing that suppliers set the energy price ceiling and act immediately, not sometime in the future. Otherwise, the pots and pans will have to go to the side and the doors will be closed.",
    "One in four at risk of poverty and social exclusion in Latvia": "In 2021, 95.4 million people in the EU, representing 21.7% of the population, were at risk of poverty or social exclusion, i.e. lived in households experiencing at least one of the three poverty and social exclusion risks (risk of poverty, severe material and social deprivation and/or living in a household with very low work intensity). This is a slight increase compared with 2020 (94.8 million; 21.6% of the population).\n\nThe risk of poverty or social exclusion varied across the EU Member States. The highest shares of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion were recorded in Romania (34%), Bulgaria (32%), Greece and Spain (both 28%) and Latvia (26%).\n\nIn contrast, the lowest shares of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion were recorded in Czechia (11%), Slovenia (13%) and Finland (14%).\n\nAmong the 95.4 million people in the EU that faced the risk of poverty or social exclusion, some 5.9 million (1.3% of the total population) lived in households experiencing all three poverty and social exclusion risks simultaneously.\n\nIn 2021, 73.7 million people in the EU were at risk of poverty, while 27.0 million were severely materially and socially deprived, and 29.3 million lived in a household with low work intensity.\n\nFor people living in households with dependent children, the risk of poverty rate ranged from highs of 35.4 % in Romania, 31.7 % in Greece and 31.5 % in Spain down to 11.4 % in Finland, 10.7 % in Czechia and 9.9 % in Slovenia. For those in households without dependent children, the rates varied from 33.8 % in Bulgaria, 33.4 % in Latvia and 33.3 % Romania to 13.9 % in Slovakia and 10.8 % in Czechia.",

    "One month of war to cost Latvia about one billion euros": "The costs of implementation of the National Defence Service (VAD) are not at all small. However, a month of war would cost Latvia close to one billion euros, said parliamentary secretary to the Ministry of Defence Baiba Bļodniece during a meeting of Saeima’s Comprehensive National Defence Subcommittee.\n\nDespite the fact that all related legislative projects are still on the way to the parliament, on Tuesday, 20 September, there was the first official discussion of VAD in the Saeima.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence is aware the costs are very high. This is why it is proposed to introduce VAD gradually – over the course of several years. Latvia cannot afford to do nothing in the current geopolitical situation. Additionally, VAD is a matter of long-term security. «One month of war would cost us close to a billion euros,» added Bļodniece.\n\nShe reminded what the Ministry of Defence previously said – that adoption of VAD and state defence costs are to reach 3% of the country’s GDP.\n\nThis will require support from the 14th Saeima. The existing 2.5% of GDP allow for introduction of VAD at the expense of existing infrastructure. Nevertheless, the ministry is aware that later on it will be necessary to allocate 3% of GDP in order to afford a full-scale military service.\n\n«We can see other countries rush to increase defence expenses. We hope the next parliament will be forward-looking and supportive. The price may be very high if we do nothing,» said Bļodniece.\n\nMultiple ministries are involved in the implementation of VAD reform. Discussions in work groups will continue. During today’s meeting, however, officials of other sectors were able to present their own opinions on the matter, including the topic of civil service for youngsters who don’t want to serve in the army.\n\nMinistry of the Interior’s Personnel Management and Administrative Department director Daiga Piebalga said the ministry is prepared to work on mechanisms in regards to implementation of a state civil service. The ministry is prepared to defend its interests and has ideas. However, it is too soon to talks about details and chosen solutions, because too much is still uncertain and there are many challenges ahead when it comes to civil service.\n\nThe ministry’s state secretary Ingūna Aire added that one of the biggest risks with the implementation of VAD would be the difficulty with filling spots in the soon-to-be police, fire fighters and border guard colleges, since the majority of healthy youngsters could be conscripted to serve in the army.\n\nMinistry of Welfare social services and disabilities policy department’s director Aldis Dūdiņš said that there are many uncertainties surrounding the state civil service. Nevertheless, he believes it will be possible to resolve problems if all ministries work together.\n\nFor example, social care centres will need people to train conscripted youngsters and supervise them. «Let’s be honest – there will be issues with discipline. Things will not go smoothly. I can already see existing employees will need ‘more motivation’ to deal with additional responsibilities,» added Dūdiņš.\n\nThe Ministry of Welfare believes that health requirements will need to be equal for VAD and civil service conscripts. The topic of accommodation options remains open as well. For example, if a youngster from Zilupe is conscripted to perform duties in Riga.\n\nDūdiņš reported that he has already surveyed the situation at state social case centres that specialise with people suffering from mental disorders. Riga municipality has provided information about employment opportunities within its territory.\n\nBy the end of the year the Ministry of Defence plans to submit accurate estimates for the costs of VAD. The ministry suggests allocating up to 3% of GDP to cover defence costs, including implementation of VAD and its maintenance by 2027. The planned funding for VAD will be EUR 87.413 million in 2023, EUR 122.534 million in 2024, EUR 139.330 million in 2025, EUR 163.879 million in 2026, and EUR 178.973 million in 2027.\n\nOn Tuesday the government passed the VAD legislative draft and other accompanying law amendments.",

    "Latvia: Adverse weather forecast across Latvia through at least Aug. 31": "Event\n\nThunderstorms, with heavy rainfall, strong winds, and hail, are forecast across much of Latvia through at least Aug. 31. As of early Aug. 30, the Latvian Environment, Geology and Meteorology Agency (LEGMC) has issued red (the highest level on a three-tier scale) thunderstorm warnings for western and eastern Latvia Aug. 30 and across eastern Latvia Aug. 31. Orange thunderstorm warnings are in place in the central regions of the country Aug. 30-31. Officials could update and possibly extend the coverage of weather alerts over the coming days.\n\nHazardous Conditions\n\nSustained heavy rainfall could trigger flooding in low-lying communities near rivers, streams, and creeks. Urban flooding is also possible in developed areas with easily overwhelmed stormwater drainage systems. Sites located downstream from large reservoirs or rivers may be subject to flash flooding after relatively short periods of intense rainfall. Landslides are possible in hilly or mountainous areas, especially where heavy rainfall has saturated the soil.\n\nAuthorities could issue mandatory evacuation orders for flood-prone communities over the coming days and tornado warnings advising the public to shelter in place. Disruptions to electricity and telecommunications services are possible where severe weather impacts utility networks.\n\nTransport\n\nThe severe weather will likely contribute to transport disruptions throughout the region. Floodwaters and debris flows could render some bridges, rail networks, or roadways impassable, impacting overland travel in and around affected areas. Ponding on road surfaces could cause hazardous driving conditions on regional highways. Authorities could temporarily close some low-lying routes that become inundated by floodwaters.\n\nSevere weather will also likely trigger flight delays and cancellations at airports across the affected region, including but not limited to Riga International Airport (RIX). Flooding could block regional rail lines; freight and passenger train delays and cancellations are likely in areas that see heavy rainfall and potential track inundation.\n\nLocalized business disruptions may occur in flood- or tornado-hit areas; some businesses might not operate at full capacity because of damage to facilities, possible evacuations, and some employees' inability to reach work sites.\n\nAdvice\n\nMonitor local media for weather updates and related advisories. Confirm all transport reservations and business appointments before travel. Make allowances for localized travel delays and potential supply chain disruptions where flooding has been forecast. Do not drive on flooded roads. Charge battery-powered devices in the case of prolonged electricity outages.\n\nResources\n\nMeteoAlarm\n\nLatvian Environment, Geology and Meteorology Agency (Latvian)"
