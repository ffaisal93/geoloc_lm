WFP plans to expand support to three additional regions, reaching 11 regions.\n\n• Migration flows at the northern and southern borders have increased. Consequently, WFP will target more migrants than planned.\n\n• Since the cost of living is changing due to food inflation, WFP and the International Rescue Committee conducted a joint income and expenditure gap analysis to update the Minimum Expenditure Basket. Results will inform cash-based interventions’ transfer values.\n\n• WFP supported 5,558 beneficiaries of 66 ollas comunes (community-led food canteens that temporarily arise in times of crisis) in Lima with CBT to assist with nutritious food purchases.\n\n• WFP provided humanitarian logistics services nationwide to transport 1,602 mt of food and non-food items on behalf of 16 partners, including the Government and the National Institute of Civil Defence, benefiting 359,232 people.\n\n• WFP trained 460 community health workers (47 percent women and 53 percent men) on nutrition practices for reducing anaemia, nutrition counselling and malnutrition screening approaches. Community health workers then conduct home visits to promote healthy food and nutrition practices, measure mid-upper arm circumference of children under 5 to identify malnourished children or at risk who are referred to clinics.\n\n• WFP’s Regional Director for Latin America and the Caribbean visited Peru and held meetings with WFP staff, government counterparts, UNCT, private sector, international cooperation, and media.

    "Peru declares state of emergency after Amazon oil spills": "The government of Peru on Saturday declared a 90-day state of emergency in the Peruvian Amazon communities of Cuninico and Urarinas, two indigenous-inhabited areas whose rivers have been affected by oil spills. Official information shows that the zones are home to some 2,500 native individuals who depend on artisanal fishing.\n\nThe decision comes less than a fortnight after a rupture was reported in the Petroperú-controlled Norperuano Pipeline (ONP, in Spanish), a 40-year-old construction that is 1,106 kilometers long and takes oil from the Northeastern department of Loreto to the Pacific coastal port of Bayóvar, in the Piura province.\n\nMIDAGRI, a través de la @ANAPeru, verifica en campo los efectos causados por el derrame petróleo en la región #Loreto. pic.twitter.com/18P2DMP38P — MIDAGRI – PERÚ (@midagriperu) September 24, 2022\n\nIt is estimated that about 2,500 barrels of crude oil were spilled into local rivers as of this week, affecting at least six indigenous communities of the Kukumas ethnicity. According to state-owned Petroperú, the accident was caused by an intentional 21-centimeter-long cut in the pipes, the 11th “attack” suffered by the structure since January.\n\nPeru’s National Society of Mining, Petroleum, and Energy (SNMPE) says the Norperuano Pipeline has been the target of at least 29 acts of sabotage since 2014. Peruvian special environment prosecutors have already opened a new investigation.\n\nAs The Brazilian Report has previously explained, the 782,880 square kilometers of Peruvian territory considered part of the Amazon rainforest are threatened by climate change.",

A second batch of 1 499 900 doses is expected to arrive on September 28.\n\nThe plan consists of immunizing 2 404 106 children under 5 years of age. The head of the General Directorate of Strategic Public Health Interventions, Alexis Holguin, said the process will begin this Sunday in Metropolitan Lima and will be extended from next week to the different regions of the country.\n\nAccording to the ministry, ten vaccination brigades will be deployed in homes in three areas of the Belen neighborhood, in the district of Comas, in the north of the Peruvian capital.\n\nMinsal's latest update on COVID-19 vaccination in the country indicates that a total of 83 790 285 doses have been administered. 20 681 945 have been immunized with the third dose showing an 80.8 percent progress in vulnerable population while 72.4 percent of the general population has been administered with this dose.\n\n¡Iniciamos con la vacunación contra #COVID19 de las niñas y niños de 6 meses a 4 años 11 meses!

In addition, the mandatory presentation of the vaccination card to enter closed public places will be only for people arriving from abroad.",
    "Top Things to See and Do When You Visit Peru": "One of the most popular destinations for anyone visiting Peru is Machu Picchu, however, it’s not the only attraction this South American country has to offer.\n\nThat’s not to say you shouldn’t include the Inca Trail as part of your Peru tours. Make sure it’s number one on the list, but remember to include one or more of the following.\n\nHike the Rainbow Mountain\n\nThis journey will be a day-long trek at more than 14,000 feet, but when you get to the rainbow-colored mountain it’ll be a scene you won’t forget.\n\nYou’ll be walking along a dirt path that winds between looming green peaks and eye-catching red rock but the route is gorgeous. Along the way, you’ll also find yourself walking past local villages built from local stone and alongside glittering mountain streams.\n\nSacred Valley\n\nIf you haven’t got the time to visit Machu Picchu, one alternative is to see the Sacred Valley. This tourist location includes an impressive Inca City known as Ollantaytambo and it’s a great place to explore.\n\nDune Hiking\n\nDid you even know that Peru has a desert? Well, it has and it’s a massive 188,700 square kilometers. While there’s nothing quite like hiking to the top of a dune to watch the sun go down, it’s also great fun riding around on a dune buggy.\n\nThe dunes in Peru are high enough to get your heart pounding. It could well be one of the most thrilling rides you’ve ever taken.\n\nHuacachina\n\nThis is the name given to a village that’s been built around a natural lake. It also happens to be located in the middle of the desert known as the Oasis of America.\n\nThe location is very beautiful and should be added to your list of things to do in Peru. Massive dunes surround the lake and along the shoreline, there are plenty of restaurants, guesthouses, and hotels where you can relax and chill out for a while.\n\nSandboarding\n\nIf you prefer to explore the dunes without the help of an engine, why not try sandboarding instead? If you’re already an expert snowboarder, you’ll soon get to grips with riding the sandy waves and carving out edges.\n\nNazca Lines\n\nThe Nazca Lines are possibly the coolest thing you can see in Peru. To date, nobody has been able to explain these ancient geoglyphs, which makes them all the more amazing.\n\nFrom the air, you can see 70 different plant and animal drawings along with hundreds of lines and other geometrical shapes. Some of the lines are 10 kilometers long and speak over hundreds of square kilometers.\n\nA few of the most notable figures are a lizard that measures 180 meters long, a condor with a 130-meter wingspan, and several other animals including a killer whale, spider, hummingbird, and a monkey.\n\nIt is thought that these unusual lines date back to 500 BC in Nazca culture. The Lines are one of the many UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Peru.\n\nThese intricate designs, created by primitive humans, reach 370 meters and have lasted for 2500 years.\n\nLake Titicaca\n\nThe picture at the top of the page is Lake Titicaca. It’s located at the border with Bolivia and is known for being the highest navigable lake in the world. It’s located at 3,812 meters in the Andes.\n\nApart from its height, Lake Titicaca is also somewhere where you can discover more about the culture of Peru. One memorable part of this visit is bound to be the famous floating houses.\n\nThe floating islands have been created by the Uros people out of reeds. Entire communities live their lives on the lake. As old rotting reeds float away, new reeds have to be added.\n\nThe best way to appreciate the lake is to take a boat trip to the islands and surrounding villages. While the floating islands are a popular attraction, the real charm of the area lies in the small villages lining the hills along the shores of the lake.\n\nParagliding Miraflores in Lima\n\nIf you’re a bit of an adrenalin junkie and are looking for something more adventurous to do, paragliding is for you. Peru is one of the easiest places to go paragliding and Lima is a city you should fly over. Walk down the cliffs at Miraflores and you’ll find plenty of guys willing to take you.\n\nPisco and the Ballestas Islands (Isla Ballestas)\n\nSometimes referred to as the “poor man’s Galapagos,” the Islas Ballestas are home to hundreds of thousands of birds, pelicans, dolphins, penguins, and large colonies of sea lions.\n\nYou can take a boat tour from Paracas and Pisco to the islands, leaving in the morning. The tour will take you past a hillside geoglyph, known as the “Candelabra.”\n\nAs you can see, there’s so much more to Peru than Machu Picchu. If you love an adventure, take a hike along the infamous Inca Trail to Machu Picchi. But don’t forget to include some of the suggestions above.",

    "Peru Marxist party is still a barrier to impeachment attempts, leader says": "Vladimir Cerron, the head of the far-left Peru Libre party that ushered Peru's President Pedro Castillo into power, talks to Reuters, in Lima, Peru September 20, 2022. REUTERS/Marcelo Rochabrun\n\nLIMA, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Vladimir Cerron, the head of the far-left party that ushered Peruvian President Pedro Castillo into power last year, told Reuters on Tuesday that his congressional bloc is still committed to staving off impeachment attempts against the embattled leader.\n\nCastillo won the election by a razor-thin margin last year, spooking investors on the campaign trail with a radical plan written by Cerron, the head of the Marxist-Leninist Peru Libre party. The plan included rewriting the constitution and nationalizing key industries. Peru is the world's second-largest copper producer.\n\nBut once in office, Castillo has kept the economy under moderate hands and said he will not change Peru's market-friendly rules, angering Cerron who demanded Castillo's resignation from the party, which Castillo agreed to. However, Cerron still supports Castillo remaining in the presidency.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\n\"What is missing for a (successful) impeachment are a few votes that Peru Libre could have provided at any moment,\" Cerron, a neurosurgeon trained in Cuba, told Reuters in a rare interview at his party headquarters.\n\n\"And that is definitely not our intention...Peru Libre remains an insurmountable barrier so far.\"\n\nPeru Libre controls 16 of 130 seats in Peru's unicameral Congress. Ousting Castillo requires 87 votes, but the two impeachment trials so far yielded 46 and 55 votes respectively.\n\nCerron's remarks will give Castillo breathing room at a time when some lawmakers in the opposition-led Congress are discussing launching a third impeachment attempt, although they have acknowledged they do not currently have enough votes.\n\nPeruvian politics are notoriously volatile, cycling through five presidents since 2016 and witnessing six impeachment trials in the same period.\n\nCerron said he would like Castillo to finish his term in 2026, which would make him the first elected president in a decade to do so, after Ollanta Humala who took office in 2011.\n\nCastillo is also in a weak spot, besieged by six criminal investigations, among them whether he has used the presidency to benefit his family and whether he has obstructed justice to protect key allies. His sister-in-law has been jailed, while a former minister remains on the run.\n\nCastillo has previously denied any wrongdoing.\n\nNEW CONSTITUTION EFFORTS STALLED\n\nCerron said Peru Libre is not currently seeking a constitutional assembly to redraft the Constitution.\n\nWhile writing a new magna carta remains a key party objective, he acknowledged currently there is no legal way to achieve that without persuading a majority of Congress, which remains split among conservative parties that are opposed to a rewrite.\n\n\"The doors have been closed not just for Peru Libre but for other social organizations that were supporting (a new constitution,)\" Cerron said.\n\nWhile analysts have said a constitutional rewrite is unlikely, Cerron's comments are the strongest so far acknowledging that improbable scenario.\n\nHe added he has not spoken with Castillo in a month and that Castillo's administration has abandoned virtually all of Peru Libre's objectives.\n\nCastillo \"is a pragmatic man,\" Cerron said. \"He's a president who is facing the day-to-day without having an agenda for the future.\"\n\n(In paragraph 6, corrects voting tally of first impeachment attempt to 46, not 76)\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nReporting by Marcelo Rochabrun and Marco Aquino; Editing by Josie Kao\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
    "Protection Monitoring Peru: Snapshot (July 2022) - Peru": "This snapshot summarizes the main findings of the Protection Monitoring conducted in Lima and Tacna, Peru in July 2022 as part of the humanitarian intervention of the Danish Refugee Council (DRC) and ENCUENTROS SJM in the country. This project is implemented with funding from the European Union Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid (ECHO).\n\nTo view the interactive Dashboard with the results from this period and from the beginning of the Protection Monitoring program, click here.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nOver the course of July 2022, DRC and ENCUENTROS SJM interviewed 34 households accounting for a total of 129 persons. Since the beginning of the Protection Monitoring exercise in Peru in October 2020, 1,434 households have been interviewed reaching a total of 5,028 persons.\n\nANALYSIS OF THE PROTECTION SITUATION\n\nThe Peruvian Government proceeds with the extension of the Temporary Residence Permit up to two years, regulating the migratory situation and granting rights and duties for foreigners in Peru.\n\nIn July, the Peruvian Migration authorities made an important announcement in regards with the extension of the deadline to manage the Temporary Residence Permit Card (CPP), which grants rights and duties to foreigners and inserts them into Peruvian society for a period of 90 calendar days.\n\nAs announced, the interested individuals will be able to manage the document until October 2 virtually through the Digital Immigration Agency. All interested persons will be able to manage their documentation until October 2, 2022 virtually through the Digital Immigration Agency. However, the access to digital platforms, is a challenge that the population must also assume, since, due to the context of the health emergency, all these procedures are carried out through the digital platforms of Migration and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a process that for most migrants and refugees is widely complicated, knowing their discontinuous access to the internet.\n\nLikewise, this document will now be valid for 2 years. This allows the regularization of persons in an irregular migratory situation who entered before October 20, 2020. Although the validity of this document will not exceed the duration of two years, it will potentially allow the renewal of the documentation to those persons whose residence permit granted by the Migration authorities has expired since October 2020, but who still remain in Peruvian territory. Additionally, this announcement intends to motivate people who entered the country without having carried out the migratory control to regularize their entry and residence in Peru.\n\nAlthough this measure allows extending the time for immigration regularization, the requirements of the process are not clear. On the one hand, there is no reference to the evidence necessary to demonstrate entry into the country before the deadline, which would imply an impediment for people who entered in an irregular manner without immigration control or who are without documentation. In the same way, there have been identified people who have independently managed such procedure, indicating a date of entry to Peru after October 20, 2020 and have been granted the CPP, so there are doubts as to whether such date is mandatory.\n\nThis announcement is expected to reduce a significant burden borne by Venezuelan migrants and refugees who were unable to cover the financial cost of fines imposed by the Migration authorities due to the expiration of their legal residence permits.\n\nTwo days before the announcement of the extension, more than 100,000 Venezuelan migrants and refugees were called to pay costly fines imposed by the National Migration System, amounts they were unable to pay due to their limited economic resources, facing the fear of being forced to leave the country. In the case of people who have exceeded their time of stay, the cost of the fine is 4.60 soles per day (a little more than one dollar) and 46 soles per day in the case of people who did not make extensions on time. Knowing that DRC Monitoring shows that 76.6% of the people surveyed earn less than 900 soles per month, these fines are unaffordable for families already living in a precarious situation.\n\nDespite the fact that the migratory and refugee situation is crucial and affects different strata of the political and socioeconomic context of Peru; on July 28, during the presidential speech that is traditionally made in Congress, there was no mention of the expulsion of foreigners from Peru as had been stated in the inaugural speech of the previous year. Additionally, there was also no allusion to migration policy, nor to measures for the protection of the foreign population residing in the country. The absence of any relevant reference to migration policies suggests that no public policy decisions prioritizing complementary protection measures for refugees and migrantsin Peru are currently being foreseen.",
    "Closing Peru's Ethnic Gaps Amidst Sustained Economic Growth": "Closing Peru's Ethnic Gaps Amidst Sustained Economic Growth\n\nAuthor/Editor:\n\nCarlos Chavez ; Gonzalo Salinas ; Yuri Zamora\n\nPublication Date:\n\nSeptember 9, 2022\n\nElectronic Access:\n\nFree Download.

The views expressed in IMF Working Papers are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily represent the views of the IMF, its Executive Board, or IMF management.\n\nSummary:\n\nWe analyze the recent evolution of ethnic economic inequality in Peru, a major source of social discontent in the country. Household survey data indicates that recent decades of high output growth also witnessed a substantial narrowing of socioeconomic gaps among ethnicities. Most notably, the Mestizo ethnic group surpassed the White group in income per capita, and Native American also experienced a relative improvement. Mincerian regression analysis suggests that the main contributors to these developments were rural-to-urban migration and increased education. Based on our statistical findings, we propose enhancing education and other public services, increasing government revenues, lowering informality, and promoting competition as the main public policies that could accelerate the ongoing narrowing of ethnic gaps.",
    "Peru set for double-digit hike in grape exports": "Shipments are forecast to reach 71.5m cartons in 2022/23 according to initial forecasts from Provid\n\nPeruvian table grape exports could top 600,000 tonnes of grapes in the 2022/23 campaign, equivalent to 71.5m (8.2kg) cartons, according to the latest forecast from industry association Provid. This would represent an increase of 11 per cent on last season.\n\nLogistical disruption is once again set to cause major headaches for exporters, while soaring production and shipping costs and the strengthening dollar will likely impact the profitability of the campaign.\n\nAs with last season, there are concerns that the low availability of containers, late changes to shipping itineraries and slow clearance of consignments through customs could add days, if not weeks, onto journey times, putting considerable pressure on fruit quality and shelf-life.\n\nNational plant health authority Senasa said it plans to authorise 23,000ha of grape plantings located in the regions of Ica, Piura, Lambayeque, La Libertad, Arequipa and Ancash, along with 104 packhouses ahead of the new season.\n\nMeanwhile, the sector continues to work hard to open new markets. This season will see the first exports to Japan, while negotiations with Chile and Japan are also reported to be at an advanced stage, with both markets expected to open in the short term.",
    "Paradise lost: Inside Peru's emergency zone": "One woman said she was 16 when she agreed to work at a bar in the area in August 2021 on the promise of making more money in a week than most make in a month. She said she had no idea that the job would involve sexually catering to men. She was ultimately paid $50 for sex, but also had to endure physical and psychological abuse from her boss and the boss’s children.\n\n“The entire time I worked there was absolute hell,” said the woman, who managed to escape in March after police raided the illicit establishment. “I would not want even one more woman to go through the same thing.”\n\nDiana Valencia, a prosecutor in Madre de Dios focused on human trafficking, said her office brought charges against 90 people in the first six months of this year.\n\nA young woman who requested anonymity was 16 when she was recruited to work at a “prosti-bar” in Puerto Maldonado. A young woman who requested anonymity was 16 when she was recruited to work at a “prosti-bar” in Puerto Maldonado.\n\nU.S. authorities and the Peruvian national police are now assisting local law enforcement in the region. In February, a U.S.-assisted operation led to the arrest of three trafficking suspects and the rescue of multiple victims.\n\n“Many of the victims are threatened,” Valencia said. “When they get to the place, they are deprived of their liberty, their ID is retained, so that they can’t leave.”\n\nGuadalupe eventually stopped traveling to the camps himself because of the various dangers and instead focused on expanding his network of collaborators. The local police started raiding the prosti-bars and bringing the young girls they rescued to Guadalupe’s shelter, where they would be provided with clothes, food, education and a bed.\n\nThe shelter also welcomed poor kids who moved to Mazuko to attend school but had no family in the area. Those rescued from the mines would join in on the lessons, Guadalupe said, providing a mental escape from the horrors they had endured.\n\nIn all, Guadalupe said more than 1,000 children had passed through his shelter until he closed it in 2019 due in large part to the coronavirus pandemic. The local government had by then set up its own facility to house children trafficked to the mines.\n\n\n\nGuadalupe said the youngest boy he cared for was 8; the youngest girl was 9. Some of the children stayed for a couple of days, others for a couple of years.\n\nSome of them went on to become college students and parents themselves. One is now studying medicine in college in order to become a doctor.\n\n“I don’t think that I have done a great job,” Guadalupe said. “I just did what I had to do.”\n\nHe now travels the country educating people on the dangers of child trafficking. But there are some stories he cannot tell without breaking down.\n\nThe first girl he rescued was a 13-year-old who spoke no Spanish, only an Indigenous language. When Guadalupe found her, she was sick with an infection after being sexually abused by miners.\n\nGuadalupe brought her to a local clinic but they weren’t able to pursue her attackers because she didn’t know their names. At the time he still didn’t know that the men who abuse girls like her rarely face justice because the mines are so remote and catching them in the act is difficult.\n\nEven two decades later, he said he’s still haunted by what that young girl went through and the lack of accountability for her abusers.\n\n“When we remember it, we feel we haven’t done anything,” he said with tears in his eyes.",

It also predicted that annual inflation would rise to 7.8% this year and 3.0% in 2023.\n\nThis comes after Finance Minister Kurt Burneo last week launched an economic package aimed at lifting the economy at times of a global slowdown and falling copper prices, which are key to the country's economy. read more\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nBurneo had earlier in September said Peru could achieve economic growth of 3.9% in 2022, rising to 4.3% in 2023, thanks to the stimulus package, although many of its measures are still awaiting approval from Congress. read more\n\n\"There are no magic wands\", central bank chief Julio Velarde told a press conference, saying the bank was still examining the impacts of the government's stimulus measures.\n\nVelarde said the bank was maintaining its 2022 fiscal deficit projection at 1.9% of gross domestic product (GDP) and at 1.8% of GDP next year.\n\nRegarding Peru's key mining sector, Velarde said investment should decline by 3.7% in 2022 and in 2023 this decline should deepen to 16.2%, following the completion of Anglo American's Quellaveco copper project (AAL.L) in the south of the country.\n\nPeru is the world's second largest copper producer and its mining exports total around 60% of the South American country's overall exports.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nReporting by Marco Aquino; Writing by Aida Pelaez-Fernandez; Editing by Sarah Morland, Mark Porter and Jonathan Oatis\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
    "GIEWS Country Brief: Peru 06-September-2022 - Peru": "FOOD SECURITY SNAPSHOT\n\n2022 paddy output forecast slightly above the average due to good yields attained in the first half of the year Cereal import requirement forecast at a slightly above-average level in 2022 Cereal prices well above their year-earlier levels in July 2022\n\n2022 paddy output forecast to be slightly above average due to good yields attained in the first half of the year\n\nHarvesting of paddy crop takes place throughout the year, with nearly a half of production concentrated during the May-July period. Paddy production in the third quarter of the year, when on average one-fifth of the annual production is harvested, is forecast to be near average in 2022 on the account of average sowings. According to satellite imagery, vegetation conditions are generally favourable in the key producing rain forecast (selva) and coastal areas. The paddy output gathered in the first half of 2022 is officially estimated to be 10 percent above the average. This is due to the record-high yields attained as a result of favourable weather conditions. Reflecting this bumper harvest, the aggregate paddy production in 2022 is preliminarily forecast at 3.45 million tonnes, about 3 percent above the five‑year average.\n\nYellow maize for feed use is also harvested all year round and nearly 30 percent of the annual output is gathered in the July‑September period. Planted area to be harvested in the third quarter of 2022 is estimated at a slightly below-average level. The contraction in sowings, despite high maize prices and adequate soil moisture conditions, could be attributed to reduced availabilities of fertilizers, as imports in the first half of 2022 were more than 25 percent below the five‑year average of the same period. The 2022 production of yellow maize is forecast to be an average level of 1.2 million tonnes, supported by the above-average harvest in the first half of the year.\n\nRegarding white maize for food use, harvesting was completed in August and production is anticipated at above-average 330 000 tonnes. While the planted area was near average, yields were excellent on accounts of favourable weather conditions in the major producing highlands.\n\nCereal import requirement forecast at a slightly above‑average level in 2022\n\nWheat import requirement is forecast at a slightly above‑average level owing to the rising food demand, supported by the increasing population. Maize imports, which account for 60 percent of the total annual cereal imports, are also anticipated to be slightly above the average. This mainly reflects an acceleration of increase in poultry production in the first half of 2022, after a decline in production by about 3 percent in 2020. With the highest per capita consumption of chicken meat in Latin America, the demand for yellow maize by the domestic poultry sector has been generally increasing during the past ten years.\n\nCereal import requirement in the 2022 marketing year (January/December) is anticipated at a slightly above‑average level of 6.4 million tonnes.\n\nCereal prices well above their year-earlier levels in July 2022\n\nThe annual food inflation rate in Lima metropolitan area recorded an increase of 10 percent in July 2022 , up from 3 percent in the same month in 2021. Wholesale prices of cereals rose since April 2022, reflecting rising production and transportation costs. Elevated international quotations exerted additional upward pressure on domestic prices. This was particularly the case for prices of wheat flour, due to high dependency on wheat imports to satisfy its domestic consumption needs as well as high processing costs. While prices of yellow maize and rice were 20 percent higher year on year in July 2022, prices of wheat flour were nearly 45 percent above those a year earlier.\n\nThe government introduced a series of measures to contain price increases and improve access to food. These include a temporary VAT exemption for chicken meat, eggs, pasta, bread and their inputs from May to July 2022 as well as a new food voucher programme “* Bono Alimentario .*” The programme aims to deliver a one‑off payment of 200‑300 PEN (equivalent to about 50‑80 USD) to 1.3 million vulnerable households (6.5 million people and about 17 percent of total population) under the new budget of 2 000 million PEN (equivalent to about 520 million USD).\n\nDisclaimer: The designations employed and the presentation of material in this information product do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of FAO concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries.",

    "Peru president’s sister-in-law sent to jail amid corruption probe": "The sister-in-law of Peruvian President Pedro Castillo has been given 30 months of pre-trial detention on Sunday, the most serious escalation so far of a host of criminal investigations that have targeted the leader’s inner circle.\n\nCastillo has often referred to Yenifer Paredes, his sister-in-law, who he and his wife raised since she was little, as his “daughter”.\n\nProsecutors allege she was part of a group that engaged in influence peddling to assign public contracts to allies of Castillo in their home region of Cajamarca, in the Peruvian Andes.\n\nParedes has not been charged with a crime and she will spend time in jail as prosecutors continue their investigation.\n\nCastillo, who has been in office for 13 months, is besieged by scandals and has already survived two impeachment attempts. He denies any wrongdoing and has accused prosecutors of being complicit in an attempt to remove him from power.\n\nProsecutors have opened six criminal investigations against him, including one for alleged obstruction of justice in the firing of a former interior minister.\n\nAnother former minister has been on the run for months, while the current transport minister has kept his job despite prosecutors alleging he is part of a “criminal organisation” alongside Castillo.\n\nProsecutors have also asked that Castillo’s wife, Lilia Paredes, be banned from travelling abroad for the next three years.\n\nWhile prosecutors have moved aggressively with Castillo’s inner circle, they cannot charge or detain him while he remains president.\n\nPeruvian leaders have often been ensnared by corruption scandals.\n\nFour past presidents are either in jail, in house arrest or facing charges that could lead them to prison time in the future.",
    "Peru’s Troubles Go Well Beyond Castillo": "Peru’s economy was once dubbed a “miracle” by analysts who marveled at its stability despite years of political chaos. But now, it’s facing tough times.\n\nDespite a strong rebound in 2021 after the COVID-19 pandemic, Fitch Ratings has revised down its projections for GDP growth in 2022 from 2.5% to 2.3%. Similarly, the IMF has adjusted its projection from 3.3% to 2.8% and has announced that Colombia’s growth rate looks set to overtake Peru this year. Analysts have pointed to adverse global financial conditions, including high inflation and less demand from China, Peru’s main trade partner and the biggest consumer of its mineral exports.\n\nThere is no doubt that Peru is not performing as it once did. But what’s new is that the country’s economy is finally being affected negatively by political crises. A recent Reuters article noted that Peru’s central bank had recorded the lowest level of investor confidence since the 2008 recession, due to the series of corruption scandals and constant cabinet changes of Pedro Castillo’s government. According to Fitch, “politics and the economy can no longer be treated separately.”\n\nBut how fair is it to say that the Castillo administration is fully to blame for Peru’s economic woes? While the country’s governability has always been shaky, Castillo has taken this to new levels. Currently, the president is facing six criminal investigations that implicate him directly in bribery and other corruption schemes and include his wife and sister-in-law as well as several other close associates. He has reshuffled his cabinet 59 times in a year, which means that there has been a new minister every week on average. Congress is also not helping matters; so far it has tried twice to impeach Castillo and will likely try again. The general chaos prompted over 200 business organizations to sign an open letter in July condemning all the corruption allegations against the president and demanding that Congress remove him if these continue to appear.\n\nIt’s not surprising that Castillo is facing opposition from business groups, due to the alarm his presumed leftist agenda caused since the beginning of his presidency. But Peru’s economic troubles go beyond investor confidence. It was only a matter of time until the country’s economy could no longer solely rely on its solid macroeconomic policies. Previous governments, all very business-friendly, were able to keep politics divorced from economics mostly because in the 2000s and 2010s there was an appetite for Latin American resources not seen since the end of the Second World War. This commodity boom, driven by China’s rise, allowed Peru to accumulate high levels of reserves, grow almost 6% annually for years and reduce poverty to 20% from the 50% recorded in the early 2000s. It also let governments ignore repeated warnings that secondary reforms would be necessary to maintain economic performance.\n\nAlready by 2014, for example, the IMF and World Bank were stressing the need for Peru to have a broader tax base, to modernize its labor market in order to incorporate more workers into the formal sector, to invest in technology and to diversify its economy so that it reduced its reliance on mineral exports, which make up about 10% of the country’s GDP. None of these things occurred.\n\nNeither was any previous government able to provide a definitive solution to the social conflicts that have repeatedly arisen around mining projects in the last decade. Relationships between mining companies and the communities that live in their vicinity have become increasingly frayed. The Las Bambas copper mine, owned by MMG, was recently paralyzed for almost 50 days, despite the government’s several attempts at brokering talks between the population and the company. However, protests have been occurring since 2015, and in general, the inability to resolve the social conflict issue has now resulted in a smaller pipeline for mining investment in 2022.\n\nWhat’s interesting is that Castillo’s new minister of Finance, Kurt Burneo, a well-known technocrat, has publicly recognized the need to recuperate investor confidence in order to foster economic growth. Two weeks ago, while presenting the budget for the next fiscal year, Burneo stressed that one of the government’s goals is to recover this confidence by promoting private investment through commissions that fast-track projects and government-to-government arrangements like the one with the United Kingdom for the 2019 Panamerican Games. Burneo has also stated that the ministry will not seek to increase taxes in a similar effort to reassure investors.\n\nThe Castillo government, thus far, has not proved to be the threat to the private sector that it was feared to be. In fact, it has largely maintained the same fiscal and macroeconomic management that’s been in place since the structural adjustment policies implemented in the 1990s.\n\nAnd yet, macroeconomic discipline alone cannot foster the conditions necessary for Peru’s development. Politics was eventually bound to catch up to the economy. Unfortunately, it has coincided with a highly incompetent president at the helm, adding fuel to the fire.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR Moncada, a contributing columnist to Americas Quarterly, is a Peruvian journalist and political analyst currently based in the UK.

    "Amid disgust over corruption, Peru regional elections spark little enthusiasm": "By Paula Bayarte\n\nLima, Sep 21 (EFE) – A deep cynicism reigns on the streets of Peru ahead of next month’s regional and municipal elections, with most people slamming the country’s political class as hopelessly corrupt and saying virtually no candidates deserve their support.\n\n“I don’t know who I’m going to vote for because there are no proper candidates,” Manuel, a street fruit vendor in a working-class Lima neighborhood, told Efe.\n\nAsked what he is looking for in the next mayor of this capital, he said “someone without a (criminal past) who has done something for his people would be enough,” though adding that none of the candidates are to his liking.\n\nRegional and municipal elections are scheduled to be held on Oct. 2.\n\nBut despite their proximity, there has been a striking lack of political rallies and a notable absence of headline-grabbing proposals by the candidates.\n\nThe only indication of the upcoming balloting is the presence of campaign signs, particularly in poorer neighborhoods and small municipalities, as well as some traffic-blocking public works projects.\n\nThose latter initiatives are also viewed cynically by a jaded electorate, who say they are a telltale sign that elections are around the corner.\n\nManuel’s sentiments are echoed by most other ordinary citizens, who say they assume all politicians are corrupt. Indeed, the level of distrust is so high that voter participation would inevitably be very low if the country did not have compulsory voting laws.\n\n“There will aways be corruption, whether the candidate is good or bad. The only way to vote for a non-corrupt candidate is to vote for the last one on the list,” Gamaliel joked while standing outside a shopping mall in this capital with his wife, who said she will vote for the current mayor of the Lima district of Chorrillos even though he is ineligible to run again.\n\nThe indifference of voters contrasts with an ongoing intense political crisis that is now the main focus of news coverage in Peru.\n\n“They’re all scoundrels. All my life they’ve done the same. I’ve lived here since 1952, and there hasn’t been one good candidate. They’re all thieves. It’s a shame. I won’t vote. I’m 81 years old and I’ve always gone (to cast a ballot), but I don’t need anyone anymore because I live happily with my work. A total change is needed,” one passer-by, Manuel Sialer, said.\n\nAnother woman riding in a combi (a small minibus) who preferred to remain anonymous said she will cast a blank ballot because “these mayors come in, steal and do nothing.”\n\nOne teenager Efe spoke to expressed similar disgust with the political class.\n\n“Young people aren’t very interested. They’re into their own things and vote just to vote,” Jair Manosalva, a 19-year-old from Peru’s northern coastal region, told Efe outside a Lima gym. “They’ve disappointed us too much. We don’t care about them anymore. So whoever wins is going to be the same as the next one or the one who just left.”\n\nThe front runners in Lima mayor’s race are Daniel Urresti, a retired army general and former interior minister; and Rafael Lopez Aliaga, a businessman and right-wing populist.\n\nBoth have pledged to battle corruption and crime if elected.\n\nAgustin Luyo, a shoe shiner in Villa Maria del Triunfo, says the fight against street crime is the top priority for residents of that low-income district on Lima’s south side.\n\nGuillermo, who spoke to Efe on the opposite side of the city, said he is voting for Lopez Aliaga because that candidate will “clean up corruption” and “improve public safety.” EFE\n\npbc/mc",
    "JetSMART Peru Granted Permission To Conduct International Flights": "JetSMART Peru has now got access to 22 new routes and can start spreading its wings deeper into South America.\n\nLittle more than three months since it launched operations, JetSMART Peru has been granted rights to 22 new routes. These rights include flights from Peru to Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador and Chile.\n\nThe rights were issued by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation of Peru (DGAC). According to Aviacionline.com, the DGAC said it had granted the request of the local subsidiary of JetSMART and authorized operations to Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador and Chile. JetSMART Peru is allowed to carry out regular passenger, cargo and mail operations with third and fourth freedom air traffic rights. The report said these are in accordance with the pre-existing agreements of the Andean Community, the Fortaleza Agreement and the bilateral agreement between Peru and Chile.\n\nMore A320neos will be needed in Peru\n\nJetSMART Peru has a fleet of three Airbus A320neos and will need more to service the new routes. Photo: JetSMART.\n\nOf the 22 routes listed, all but one allow for up to seven weekly services, with the outlier being the Lima - Santiago - Lima route which allows for up to 16 weekly services. If all the new routes were taken, admittedly an unlikely scenario, that would add 163 new services to the 15 routes and 12 destinations JetSMART Peru currently operates. Data from ch-aviation.com shows the airline, a subsidiary of JetSMART, has three Airbus A320-200neos, which is not enough to take on 22 new routes.\n\nParent company JetSMART has a larger fleet of four A320-200s, three A320-200neos and one A321-200neo. However, the data lists JetSMART has outstanding orders with Airbus for 105 aircraft, including 43 A320neos, 48 A321neos and 14 A321XLRs. How and where those aircraft will be deployed is not shown, but they will likely find homes in the group's airlines in Chile, Argentina and Peru. JetSMART Peru launched operations in June with an inaugural domestic flight from Lima to Arequipa, one of the 13 routes in its initial network.\n\nA part of JetSMART's strategy is to offer SMART routes, which are interregional routes that connect point to point and bypass Lima. These are Arequipa-Cuzco, Arequipa-Trujillo, Arequipa-Piura and Arequipa-Tarapoto. Arequipa is a commercial and industrial center in Peru, located around 745 miles (1,200 kilometers) south of Lima, with approximately one million inhabitants.\n\nA strong ULCC pedigree\n\nJetSMART first commenced services in Chile, its home base, in 2017, followed by JetSMART Argentina in 2019 and JetSMART Peru in 2022. The company is owned by Indigo Partners, which invests in three other ultra-low-cost carriers, Frontier Airlines, Volaris and Wizz Air. In 2019 Peru was a growing market for air travel, with 14 million domestic and 12.3 million international passengers, although that fell to eight million domestic and 3.4 million international passengers in 2021.\n\nJetSMART expects to receive 105 aircraft from Airbus, including 48 A321neo and 14 A321XLR.

    "In Peru, technology brings young people into politics": "In Peru, about 68 percent of young people have expressed an interest in politics, and about a third have volunteered, donated and advocated on behalf of initiatives during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result young people have mobilized to fight corruption and have become known as the “Bicentenary Generation” – those who tend to have a deep mistrust of institutions and actively advocate for a more democratic society. Yet despite many advocating for change, youth participation in the political space remains low. Less than 8 percent of registered party members are under 30. That’s changing with the Redpública initiative, where young people are able to freely participate in the democratic policy-making process. It encourages young people to crowdsource ideas to solve the country’s most complex problems. By portraying the views and values of civil society about the pandemic recovery, people can then work together to create solutions in their communities and in their country. Redpública is coordinated by UNDP and the Danish government under the Tech for Democracy initiative. Together they aim to democratize and decentralize knowledge on emerging practices and tools for social change, map solutions and design public policies and services that expand the public agenda. The Redpública volunteer programme has more than 140 young people engaged in 14 regions.\n\nBusiness administration student Diego Salazar, 19, joined a hackathon in Arequipa. Photo: UNDP Peru/Bruno Cámara Rojo\n\nDiego Salazar, 19, is a business administration student from Arequipa, and he uses Redpública to engage in problem-solving local issues that benefit society. “Open innovation spaces are important because it injects the need for innovative thinking into the citizenship’s DNA. If you want your constituents to start pushing for more disruptive ideas, have critical thoughts, then you need these spaces,” he said. “What pushes me to participate in open innovation spaces is the impact that I can create. I like seeing how the knowledge that everyone brings to the table transforms itself into tangible solutions that benefit society.” Redpública democratizes ideas and information and promotes human rights. Without the ability to share information, the lack of capacity for advocacy and change-making prevents people from coming together to solve local and national problems. Redpública addresses this issue, encouraging participation from all, making democratic institutions stronger and more responsive to their constituents.\n\nInformation systems management student Gabriela Pillco, 20, attended a hackathon in Arequipa. Photo: UNDP Peru/Bruno Cámara Rojo\n\n“I come to these spaces because I like to get in touch with the perspectives of very diverse crowds of people. I may think that I have the best solution for a complex public challenge, but it is through interactions with people from different backgrounds and different perspectives that I discover how to make my ideas better and help them keep on growing,” said Gabriela Pillco, 20, who is an information systems management student from Arequipa. To ensure all can participate regardless of access to internet and technology or issues related to gender, race, economic status or bodily ability, UNDP, along with the Pontifical Catholic University, organizes focus groups which combine in-person meetings with telephone-mediated interviews. Policy ideas are contributed to the online platform for all to see, reducing the 'digital divide'.\n\nRayssa Hijar, 23, is an architecture and urbanism student from Cajamarca. Photo: UNDP Peru/Bruno Cámara Rojo\n\n“The platform can act as a space of catharsis. If we reach people who have always wanted their change-making ideas heard, particularly by their local authorities, then Redpública becomes a channel to release those feelings that were bottled up,” said Rayssa Hijar, 23, an architecture and urbanism student from Cajamarca. The main focus of Redpública has been community-building, connecting more than 1,500 users, who have come up with more than 280 solutions. Each month more than 480,000 people are reached.\n\nYosue Chiré de Alarcón, 25, is an industrial engineer specializing in data science. Photo: UNDP Peru/Bruno Cámara Rojo",

    "Green Investment opportunities in Peru highlights the potential of GSS+ market growth in Latin America and Caribbean (LAC)": "New report by Climate Bonds and LAGreen Fund presents a sector roadmap for sustainable finance development\n\nYesterday (15 September), at Estudio Echecopar in Lima, the Climate Bonds Initiative and the LAGreen Fund launched the Peru Sustainable Finance State of the Market 2022, the first report of its kind about the country.\n\nPeru was the first country in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) to issue a green bond (2014). As the fourth-largest country, and sixth economy in the region, there is potential for a green investment pipeline in the country. The Peruvian sustainable finance market is advancing with important milestones to encourage green, social and sustainability issuances, such as the guides by the Lima Stock Exchanges and discussions to develop a local taxonomy by 2025.\n\nLeisa Souza, Head of Latin America, Climate Bonds Initiative\n\n\"Peru is an important player in the Latin American sustainable debt market, being the first country to issue a green bond in the region. The growth of GSS+ bonds has been timid, but there is potential to favour further labelled issuances. The Peru State of the Market highlights a few of the opportunities for Peru and we are excited about how it can contribute to the discussions in the country and support more deals from Peruvian issuers.\"\n\nDiana Arango, Member of LAGreen’s Investment Committee and Technical Assistance Facility\n\n\"The green debt market in Peru has shown progressive growth, a fact which is confirmed by the Peru State of the Market. With this report, we aim to empowered local players to be agents of change who can innovate the financial system to deliver tangible climate and environmental impact. The LAGreen Fund and Technical Assistance Facility are there to complement the knowledge shared in the report by offering support, insight and potential financing to current and future GSS+ bonds issuance in Peru.”\n\nA USD6.6bn market\n\nAccording to the report, after issuing the first green bond deal in the LAC region, the Peruvian market experienced a hiatus between 2015 and 2017. It was only after the launch of the Green Bond Guide for Peru by the Lima Stock Exchange in March 2018 that the green bond market picked up again.\n\nGreen, social and sustainability and sustainability-linked (GSS+) deals originating from Peru increased in 2021, reaching USD4.8bn. Three large sovereign social and sustainability bonds account for 90% of the total. Green bonds account for 17% of Peru's GSS+ deals, with a cumulative USD1.1bn issued up to April 2022. 2019 was the record year for green issuance with USD652m. Non-financial corporates represent 97% of the cumulative issuance volume.\n\nGreen investment opportunities in Peru\n\nBased on the Climate Bonds Taxonomy, the report mapped the most relevant sectors for Peru's sustainable finance development:\n\nRenewable energy: More than 65% of its electricity mix comes from renewable sources, mainly hydropower (60%). Hydropower has a generation potential 13 times greater than the installed hydro capacity, and wind power has a generation potential 58 times greater than the installed wind capacity.\n\nSustainable water management: There is a USD22bn funding gap in sanitation that must be addressed to leverage growth, while Peru's water sector faces challenges as pollution of water bodies and wastewater treatment.\n\nLow-carbon agriculture: Agriculture and livestock are important economic sectors in the country, and while there are concerns around deforestation. Due to Peru’s location, there are opportunities to promote low-carbon agriculture management and best practices. Government launched the Sustainable Production Coalition to support these efforts.\n\nSustainable forest management: The sustainable management of the Peruvian Amazon through investments in forest maintenance and controlled production of timber and non-timber products in monitored areas can support the elimination of illegal logging and intensive extraction of valuable environmental assets.\n\nLow-carbon transport: Peru is committed to shifting its transport modals, as the transport system relies predominantly on roads. There is an infrastructure gap, with around USD49bn needed in investments by 2038.\n\nTaxonomy: Following other Latin American and Caribbean countries, such as Colombia and Mexico, Peru should develop a national green finance taxonomy by 2025, which is an important step to identity sectors that are economically relevant to a low-carbon transition in the country.\n\nTransition: Peru must support the transition of its hard-to-abate sectors that are critical to economic stability. Sectors such as industrials, cement, steel, mining and oil and gas are not eligible for green UoP investments, but SLBs or transition bonds could be issued to support transformation aligned to a 1.5ºC trajectory. Climate Bonds is developing transition criteria to support the decarbonization of these sectors. A Steel Paper will be launched soon, and the Cement and Chemicals Criteria are under development.\n\nBarriers to growth in Peru’s sustainable finance market\n\nCurrency hedging: Local issuers prefer GSS+ bonds to be denominated in local currency, which makes foreign investors require currency hedging solutions to avoid credit risk with currency risk. Currency risk is a challenge in Emerging Markets, as contracting debt in hard currencies is a higher risk and more expensive to local issuers.\n\nMarket liquidity: Peru’s capital market still struggles with lower liquidity and diversity than other LAC markets. There is a high incidence of informal labour in the country, which has prevented the establishment of a large, liquid, poll of local pension fund capital.\n\nIssuance costs: The issuance costs of smaller bonds are relatively high compared to loan financing in emerging markets like Peru. These higher costs can deter smaller issues from entering the market, while for larger deals, the costs are negligible, yet the issuer may perceive the additional steps to obtain a GSS+ label as a barrier to entry.\n\nBankability and pipeline: The risk exposure and risk-return profile of GSS+ projects may be higher than in other traditional sectors. Lack of pipeline is also a barrier for investors.\n\nMarket awareness: The understanding of thematic bonds and best practices is a central barrier for markets in LAC. Further education is needed to grow the market and to improve the business environment for GSS+ instruments.\n\nPolitical environment: Peru has a complex political landscape that is frequently changing. Market uncertainties can shift investment perceptions and capital flight to other countries. Opportunities in the GSS+ market could be encouraged through policy and institutional changes.\n\nThe Last Word\n\nThe report provides a roadmap to growing Peru’s sustainable finance market and identifies stakeholders and their roles to expand green investments in the country. For example, investors influence the market by building demand and incorporating green and sustainability into their investment policy guidelines. Regulators and policymakers can set policies and promote a conducive environment to facilitate the issuance of labelled bonds. Finally, intermediates can support local market players to follow best practices and come to the market.\n\nThe fact that the Ministry of Environment announced its intention to develop a Green Finance Taxonomy, supported by the German Corporation for International Cooperation (GIZ), is very exciting for market development in the Latin America and Caribbean region.\n\nSustainable finance can protect the country's natural resources to ensure resilient economic growth, which addresses its increasing vulnerability to natural disasters and other climate impacts. Peru's sustainability journey is underway, and the market must scale to achieve the required impact needed to transform the country.\n\nDownload the report now: < https://bit.ly/3DN6tZV > STAY TUNED!

    "Peruvian and Venezuelan girls come together to campaign for social change": "Venezuelan and Peruvian girls participating in the Chamas en Acción (Girls in Action) programme pose with two of Quinta Ola's founders, Beatriz Córdova and Gianina Márquez (second and third from the left, first row). © UNHCR/Sebastian Castañeda\n\nPau* was 11 years old when she and her mother left their native Venezuela to make the exhausting overland journey to Peru. For Pau, the transition was a difficult one. At her new school in the Peruvian capital, Lima, she became the brunt of so much bullying that she fell into a deep depression. Things got so bad that the preteen decided to adopt a Peruvian accent in a bid to no longer stand out.\n\n“It was very painful, having to lose my identity,” recalled Pau, who is now 15.\n\nBut in 2021, her mother heard about an organization, called Quinta Ola, that was working to empower young Peruvian women and Venezuelan refugees and migrants from the same demographic. She signed Pau up for one of the group’s virtual programmes during the COVID-19 pandemic. The online sessions for young Venezuelan women covered topics such as sexism, xenophobia, gender-based violence and youth activism, and gave them the confidence and tools to participate in campaigns for social change and even to design their own initiatives. Other sessions brought the Venezuelan and Peruvian girls together, stoking cross-cultural friendships.\n\n\"Now, I feel much more self-assured.\"\n\nThe sessions “gave me the chance to learn about my rights and understand what I, as a human being, deserve,” said Pau, adding that the programme, known as “Chamas en Acción,” or Girls in Action, had restored much of her prior confidence. “Having to leave my country demolished my self-esteem. But now, I feel much more self-assured.”\n\nThe programme also allowed her to bond with Peruvian girls her age.\n\n“I see [Quinta Ola] as a family, the girls are like my sisters,” said Pau, adding that her friendship with a 16-year-old Peruvian named Suyay had proved particularly rewarding.\n\nSuyay said the sessions were eye-opening for her too.\n\n“I was able to connect with the Venezuelan girls … because like me, they were also interested in feminism, empowerment and activism,” said Suyay. “Knowing we had something in common was super important to being able to connect.”\n\nPau, who is Venezuelan, and Suyay, who is Peruvian, have forged a strong friendship through their participation in the \"Chamas en Acción\" programme. © UNHCR/Sebastian Castañeda\n\nMaría, a young Venezuelan participant of \"Chamas en Acción\", studies at her house in Lima, Peru. © UNHCR/Sebastian Castañeda\n\nYoung Venezuelan and Peruvian girls take part in a workshop run by Quinta Ola. © UNHCR/Sebastian Castañeda\n\nFounded in 2017 by three Peruvian women in their early thirties, Quinta Ola – which translates to Fifth Wave, in a reference to the successive stages of the feminist movement – teaches women and girls political empowerment through workshops, community organizing, and activism. It also includes mentorships aimed at helping participants identify the types of the social change they want to champion.\n\nThe seed for the organization was planted one day when the three friends, Beatriz Córdova Aquino, Gianina Márquez Olivera and Karina Nuñez Paz, were discussing gender-based violence and came to the terrible realization that it had affected nearly every woman they knew.\n\n“At that moment, a flame was lit within us,” said Gianina, adding they wanted to find a way of breaking the cycle of violence by giving young women a voice within their own families and, eventually, a seat at the tables of power.\n\nThey initially created a group modelled after GirlGov, an empowerment programme pioneered in Pennsylvania, in the United States, and worked with no funding for the first year. But Quinta Ola’s work with Peruvian girls won them kudos and attracted financial backing, allowing them to extend their programming to include refugee and migrant girls.\n\nThis June, Quinta Ola was among seven women-led organizations to win UNHCR’s annual NGO Innovation Awards (supported this year through Safe from the Start funding from the US government) for its work focusing on the empowerment of Venezuelan girls.\n\nSee also: Yazidi women box their way to recovery\n\nWith more than 1.32 million Venezuelans now registered in Peru, the country is host to the world’s second-largest population of Venezuelan refugees and migrants – most of whom, like Pau’s family, have settled in Lima and the surrounding area. While the Peruvian government has worked to regularize the Venezuelan population, many report facing discrimination.\n\n“Teenage girls from Venezuela find themselves triply discriminated against – for being young, for being women, and for being foreigners,” said Karina, one of Quinta Ola’s founders. “For them, the situation is even more critical [than for their Peruvian counterparts] as their support networks and capacity to mobilize are both very limited.”\n\nParticipants in Quinta Ola’s “Girls in Action” programme identified the fight against xenophobia as one of their top priorities. The girls created a survey to gather data about the discrimination Venezuelans in Peru were facing and used their findings to develop recommendations for public policies aimed at curbing xenophobia, which they dispatched to Peru’s regional governments. They also formed working groups to address the hyper-sexualization of Venezuelan women and girls and discrimination in access to education.\n\nFourteen-year-old María*, a Venezuelan “Girls in Action” participant who also struggled to adapt to her new life in Lima, credited the programme not only with giving her the inner fortitude to carry on, but also showing her a path towards effecting lasting change.\n\n“I’ve learned so much about society, about the world and about myself,” she said, adding that “activism has become something fundamental for me. I sincerely don’t know what would have become of me if I hadn’t become an activist.”\n\n*The Quinta Ola participants asked to use only their first names.",

    "Mystery Diner in Peru: Riverfront Bar & Grill offers good food, late kitchen hours": "The Italian beef at Riverfront Bar & Grill in Peru was how I like it.\n\nStacks of well-seasoned beef and loads of mozzarella cheese in every bite filled a toasted, crispy bun. The sandwich also came with pepperoncini on top and au jus for dipping.\n\nThis was the perfect entree ($8.50) to take in a Sunday night football game.\n\nLocal options are limited on a Sunday evening, and Riverfront’s kitchen is open until 8 p.m. Sundays, meaning diners can get a full stomach by the second quarter.\n\nThe bar and grill has plenty of seating both indoors and on an outdoor patio – both with bars. There are several television sets at the bars and in the dining areas, and the audio of the game was featured on speakers throughout the building, making it a great place to watch.\n\nA trio of people played darts and another group hung out on the outside patio while I was there, but it’s pretty easy to stake out your own space and get comfortable.\n\nRiverfront Bar & Grill features cheese curds on its appetizer menu, offering them in regular and garlic flavors. (Mystery Diner)\n\nThe bar and grill has a full menu of appetizers: loaded nachos, cheese curds (regular or garlic), onion rings, pretzel sticks, fried pickles, mushrooms, cheese sticks, fried cauliflower, loaded fries and breaded mushrooms. I opted for the cheese curds ($7) and was pleased at the plentiful serving, acknowledging it could be shared pretty easily within a group of three.\n\nWings and football go hand-in-hand. An order of six, breaded chicken wings hot was my preference at Riverfront Bar & Grill in Peru.

Wings at Riverfront are served breaded or naked, and are flavored plain, barbecue, Buffalo, garlic Parmesan, sweet and sour, spicy sweet and sour, or hot. Additionally, the restaurant offers chicken strips and will flavor them how diners like them.\n\nThe menu also features all kinds of burgers, sandwiches (including breaded pork tenderloins), wraps, soups, salads, grilled pork chops, pasta and fried chicken/fish.\n\nWhile I chose to sit indoors, the outside patio offers a close view of the Illinois River. Patrons can eat a dinner or have drinks and watch barges float down the waterway.\n\nI’ve always loved the businesses and old buildings on Water Street in Peru, and that feeling of being below the Route 251 bridge reminds me of the riverside neighborhoods in Brooklyn.\n\nRiverfront’s bar stays open until 2 a.m., but the restaurant closes at 8 p.m. Sunday through Thursday and 9 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays. They also offer carryouts, which were popular while I was dining.\n\nIf you find yourself in the predicament I often do – it’s getting later and later, beyond the normal dinner time, and your favorite restaurants are beginning to shut down their kitchens – think Riverfront. It is a great option for a late meal, and to take in a sports game. The food was good and the atmosphere was comfortable.\n\nThe outdoor patio with a bar at Riverfront Bar & Grill in Peru provides views of the river and a place to relax outdoors for a meal or drinks.

The changes happening on Ausangate are especially important in understanding the fluctuations and adaptations of the entire Amazon River watershed,” Perry added.\n\nApp State alumna Heather Guy ’18, who is pursuing her Ph.D. at the University of Leeds in West Yorkshire, England, was another member of the expedition team. Guy — who has been working as a science technician at Summit Station in Greenland — and National Geographic Explorer and expedition co-leader Dr. Tom Matthews assisted Perry during the study abroad program as well.\n\nPerry, Matthews and Guy will analyze data from the Ausangate station, in cooperation with the National University of Saint Anthony the Abad in Cuzco (UNSAAC), the Higher University of San Andrés (UMSA) in Bolivia and the National Meteorology and Hydrology Service of Peru — all partners in the expedition.\n\nThe National Geographic Society team makes its way to high camp on Ausangate.

Skills such as leadership, perseverance, observation and cultural sensitivity are also vital.” App State alumna Heather Guy ’18\n\nPerry said he incorporates all of his experiences as a National Geographic Explorer directly into the classroom at App State — both in lectures and in laboratory assignments — in his Global Climate Change course. “I anticipate our students will assist with the data analysis from the weather stations,” he shared.\n\n“By being involved in the research project through the study abroad experience, the students learn firsthand that it is not only academic knowledge that makes scientific research successful. Skills such as leadership, perseverance, observation and cultural sensitivity are also vital.” App State alumna Heather Guy ’18\n\nGuy, who served as Perry’s research assistant in 2018 while earning her Master of Arts in geography at App State, said learning about Perry’s cutting-edge research helps students understand the relevance of their studies beyond classrooms and exams.\n\n“By being involved in the research project through the study abroad experience, the students learn firsthand that it is not only academic knowledge that makes scientific research successful. Skills such as leadership, perseverance, observation and cultural sensitivity are also vital,” Guy said.\n\nThe new Ausangate station builds upon previous Perpetual Planet Expeditions to install weather stations in high mountain environments, including to the Tupungato volcano in Chile in 2021 as well as to Mount Everest in 2019 and 2022, all of which included Perry. Rolex supports these expeditions as part of its Perpetual Planet initiative.\n\nNicole Alexiev, vice president of science and innovation programs at The Society, said the goal of the work in the Amazon River Basin is to “illuminate the critically important role this region plays in stabilizing the health of the planet, to support scientific fieldwork to better understand how climate change and other environmental factors are affecting the region and, importantly, to invest in solutions to ensure its protection.”\n\nThe initiative combines photojournalism, scientific fieldwork and partnering with local communities to highlight the effects of climate and environmental change — and the people who are working to find solutions.\n\nA group of 12 App State students participated in a study abroad program in Peru in July 2022, where they learned about climate change, glaciers, water resources and the local culture. They are pictured at Machu Picchu in Peru. Photo submitted\n\nStudy abroad, plus a bonus\n\nDuring his time at App State, Perry has led 19 study abroad education and research expeditions to the Andes, with the opportunity for students to learn about climate change, glaciers, water resources and the local culture. Perry and local collaborators operate a weather station on the Quelccaya Ice Cap (elevation of 18,537 feet, or 5,650 meters) and students hike to the station to help maintain the station and gather ice samples.\n\nThe high elevation of the summit of the glacierized area — and the intensive climb to reach it — requires gradual acclimatization over several days, in order to minimize risk of altitude sickness. The Society’s expedition team accompanied the App State students during this summer’s study abroad program in order to acclimatize for their climb up Ausangate.\n\nThe students were able to interact with The Society’s expedition team’s climate scientists and media professionals. “It added so much to the students’ experience,” Perry said.\n\nAlex Moore, an App State junior from Watkinsville, Georgia, attended the university’s Peru: Climate Change in the Andes study abroad program in July. Moore, pictured second from right, extended his trip to assist Dr. Baker Perry, National Geographic Explorer and professor in App State’s Department of Geography and Planning, and the rest of the National Geographic Society expedition team on their expedition to install a weather station on top of Ausangate. Also pictured, from left to right, are Perry, App State alumna Heather Guy ’18 and Dr. Tom Matthews, all members of the expedition team. Photo submitted by Baker Perry\n\nAlex Moore, an App State junior from Watkinsville, Georgia, who is majoring in biology-ecology, evolution and environmental biology, attended the study abroad program and extended his trip to assist with the Ausangate expedition.\n\nMoore said he could “write a book” about all he learned concerning the culture of Peru, different scientific disciplines and working in high altitudes.\n\nPrior to his time in Peru, Moore said it was difficult for him to imagine what climate change and its impact look like.\n\n“It hits you like a train when you see pictures from 10 years ago versus what you are seeing right in front of you,” Moore said. “Walking up to a glacier early in the morning that, by afternoon, becomes a stream of water and slush makes an impression in the worst way possible.”\n\nDuring the Ausangate expedition, Moore assisted the media crew, carried sections of the weather station to the base of the glacier and labeled ice samples. Though he did not climb to the summit with the team to assemble the weather station, Perry said Moore was a “huge help,” particularly when one member of the media team had to return to Cusco with sickness prior to the completion of the expedition.\n\nFrom the film crew, to the researchers, to the climbing guides, Moore said he was exposed to people who were at the “top of their game” and valued the opportunity to learn from them. After his experience, Moore said he would like to pursue a career in climate studies.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nShare your feedback on this story.\n\nBiology (BS) - Ecology, Evolution and Environmental Biology In Appalachian’s Biology (BS) - Ecology, Evolution and Environmental Biology degree (affectionately called “Triple E”), students examine the characteristics of ecosystems, their evolution and the greater environment.

    "UNHCR Peru Midyear report (January to June 2022) - Peru": "CONTEXT\n\nFrom January to June 2022, 14 bills of law have been presented in the Peruvian Congress related to human mobility. Of these, six are intended to amend the Migration Law (Legislative Decree No. 1350) on issues such as the obligations of foreigners in Peru and the right of access to housing. If approved, at least 400,000 Venezuelans would be at risk. Five other bills of law presented seek to establish various restrictions affecting refugees, asylum-seekers and migrants, such as immediate expulsions and restrictions to work, among others. The three remaining bills would eventually benefit the refugee, asylum-seeker and migrant population in Peru in areas such as access to justice and protection of women and girls' survivors of sexual and gender-based violence.",
    "Peru State falls short against MidAmerica Nazarene": "(Peru, Neb.)—Peru State football's furious comeback in the second half was not enough to defeat MidAmerica Nazarene as they lost 21-19. The Bobcats are now 2-3 overall while the Pioneers are 3-2 overall.\n\n\n\nBelow is a breakdown of how tonight's loss went…\n\n\n\nThe Bobcats received the ball to start the game but a quick three-and-out had the Bobcats punting early in the game. The Pioneers on their first possession of the game would march down the field as two big pass plays set them up at the one-yard line as they would scamper in for a one-yard score.\n\n\n\nPeru State's offense was still trying to find its groove but their drive would stall out around the 50-yard line as they would have to punt. On the Pioneers next drive the Bobcats defense stepped up big as Abe Metelus (Naples, Fla.) intercepted the ball putting the 'Cats in great position to score.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, a five-play drive ended with the Pioneers intercepting the ball back. On the next Bobcat drive Desmond Sams (Mandeville, La.) provided a spark with an 18-yard run. Then a 25-yard pass to Jarrius Anderson (Cordova, Tenn.) from Will Mueller (Springdale, Ark.) put the 'Cats in the red zone.\n\n\n\nMack Boekhout (Elkhorn) would get the Bobcats on the board with three points. Peru State trailed MNU 7-3 at the end of the first quarter. The Pioneers would go on a 10 play 89-yard scoring drive to make the score 14-3 to open the second quarter.\n\n\n\nStacy Livingston (St. Louis, Mo.) would have a 27-yard run but the Bobcat drive would stall out and a six-yard punt would put the Pioneers in great field position. The Bobcat defense stepped up forcing a three-and-out.\n\n\n\nOn the next Bobcat possession, the Pioneers would pick off the ball on the first play. Then MNU would score immediately to make the score 21-3. The Pioneers would take the 18-point lead into the half.\n\n\n\nPeru State's defense forced a three-and-out in the first drive of the second half, the Bobcat offense was still stagnant and they would have to punt on their first possession of the half.\n\n\n\nThe Bobcat defense came up big on the ensuing drive as a strip sack by Devin Adams (Pembroke Pines, Fla) and a recovery by Gerald Smith (Baltimore, MD.) setup the 'Cats offense with great field position.\n\n\n\nPeru State decided to make a change at the quarterback position as Grant Gutschow (Elkhorn) came into the game and provided a spark. On a third down Gutschow hit Kaleb Herbel for a 21-yard touchdown strike as the 'Cats would have their first touchdown trailing 21-10.\n\n\n\nMNU was driving on the next possession but they would come up empty as a 40-yard field goal was missed wide left.\n\n\n\nIt had looked like another Bobcat drive had stalled in the beginning of the fourth quarter but the 'Cats dialed up a fake punt as Adams had a 31-yard rush on fourth down putting Peru State in MNU territory.\n\n\n\nBoekhout would hit a 27-yard field goal to make it a one possession game 21-13 with a little under ten minutes remaining in the fourth quarter. A three-and-out by the Pioneers would have the Bobcats in possession of the ball with a little more than halfway to go in the fourth quarter.\n\n\n\nThen another fake punt by Adams, this time a pass play to TJ Soules (Fort Worth, Texas) for a 36-yard gain had Peru State nearing the red zone. The Bobcats would turn the ball over on downs albeit a questionable spot on the fourth down play.\n\n\n\nPeru State had one more chance with the ball down eight with 1:30 to go. Gutschow started with a 13-yard gain. Then a 21-yard pass to Gregory Adams (Pembroke Pines, Fla.) had the 'Cats at the MNU 34-yard line.\n\n\n\nThen a nine-yard run by Gutschow had the Bobcats down to the four-yard line. Then after a penalty giving the Bobcats another first down after it looked like it was going to be fourth and goal, Gutschow scampered into the end zone for the score with nine seconds remaining.\n\n\n\nThe 'Cats now trailing by two 21-19, needing the two-point conversion, Unfortunately, Gutschow threw an interception. Peru State fell to MidAmerica Nazarene 21-19.\n\n\n\nMueller was 4-of-11 for 60 yards and two interceptions. Gutschow was 2-of-8 for 42 yards, he had a throwing and rushing touchdown.\n\n\n\nSams led the way in rushing with 13 carries for 60 yards. Soules led the way in receiving with one reception for 36 yards.\n\n\n\nDefensively Clayton Thrasher (Mandeville, La.) had led the way in tackles with nine. Adams, Ka'Von Lofton (Apopka, Fla.), Kolby Amman and Thrasher each had a sack. Smith had the lone fumble recovery after Adams forced it and Metelus had the lone interception.\n\n\n\nPeru State welcomes Evangel to the Oak Bowl next Saturday, October 1, at 2:00 p.m., for the homecoming game.",
    "Changing lives through music: legendary tenor's dream for Peru": "“I had a dream. I had the dream of helping disadvantaged boys and girls in Peru…“Juan Diego Flórez\n\nAn extraordinary social project in Peru is helping to change the lives of disadvantaged children through the power of music education. The project is the initiative of the internationally acclaimed Peruvian tenor, Juan Diego Flórez.\n\nInspiration for Sinfonía por el Perú\n\nFlórez was first introduced to this concept when he visited Venezuela in 2009 to perform with conductor Gustavo Dudamel. Venezuela’s El Sistema was an internationally lauded programme known to have helped children coming from a background of crime and drug abuse since its creation in the 1970s.\n\nInspired by this project Flórez then created numerous music schools throughout Peru, where children from socially disadvantaged backgrounds have access to free music education. They can learn an instrument or sing in the choir and the best of them make it to the Youth Orchestra which gets to perform with Flórez.\n\nSome of these musicians from the music education programme, Sinfonía por el Perú, have embarked on an extraordinary journey, taking them from Lima to Salzburg. One of them is Gabriel Vera Correa. Life hasn’t always been easy for the 15-year-old, but music has given him a purpose as his mother Nelly Mercedes Vera Correa, explains.\n\n“He was bullied at school because he was chubby. There were kids who threw his backpack in the bin. Music has helped him to lose his fears, to feel more confident, to feel that whatever he wanted to achieve he was able to achieve.”\n\nGabriel Vera Correa, a 15 year old viola player in Lima. Euronews\n\nGabriel plays with the Sinfonía por el Perú Youth Orchestra and explains how he discovered a passion for his instrument.\n\n“I’ve always liked music and have always been interested in learning, whether it is an instrument or singing. I was thinking of starting the violin and then I came across the viola and fell in love with this instrument. My favourite moment is when I’m with Sinfonía because it just makes me happy. It makes me feel grateful to be alive because I’m learning to play an instrument.”\n\nThe power of music to change society\n\nAs well as his day job as a legendary tenor, Juan Diego Flórez, is also the Founder & President of Sinfonía por el Perú, and he explains the vision he had when he began this project.\n\n“When I decided to do Sinfonia por el Peru I had a dream. I had the dream of helping disadvantaged boys and girls in Peru to you know, find a space where they feel secure, where they can develop, where they can find education, where they can have values for life.”\n\nSeeing the impact his initiative has had on the thousands of lives of the children involved, has changed his perception of what music is and what it can achieve. As Florez describes.\n\n“Before I understood that music can change society, for me, music was going to the theatre singing and everybody applauding and that's great. But now I see music as a way to change the world, as a way to improve society, as a way of making a better world.”\n\nPeruvian childrern from Sinfonía por el Perú initiative Euronews\n\nThousands of children throughout Peru regularly practice for several hours every day in one of the numerous music schools called nucléo, created by the programme.\n\nLuis Castillo is the coordinator núcleos and a music teacher for the Sinfonía por el Perú.\n\n“The impact of Sinfonia has been wonderful and marvellous. It influences their behaviour, their whole development, not only in terms of music, but it also encompasses the family and it even has an impact on society.”\n\nRecent research also shows that the programme has significantly increased creativity, self-confidence, and academic success. As Florez explains.\n\n“The first study had amazing results. The prevalence of child labour was reduced in 90%. Of course, because they were at the núcleo making music together. Their parents were less violent towards them, but the results that struck me the most were that they wanted to continue into university studies.”\n\nJuan Diego Flórez, acclaimed tenor & Founder & President of Sinfonía por el Perú Euronews\n\nDiana Espinoza, is a flutist, with the Sinfonía por el Perú Youth Orchestra and is among those taking her studies to the next level. The 18-year-old is doing her post-graduate degree at Lima’s Universidad Nacional de Musica. Looking back, she says she values the important life-lessons she learned at Sinfonía.\n\n“I learned teamwork, it helped me to take on responsibility, to know that I have to be organised and have a certain schedule. And then it gave me a passion for music. I want to do this all my life, playing in an orchestra and being a professional musician.”\n\nDiana is also part of the Sinfonía por el Perú Youth Orchestra, where only the best students from the various music schools get to perform together.\n\n“What I like the most and what I enjoy the most is playing with my friends and doing what we are passionate about. Playing symphonies together, enjoying melodies together. That's what I Iove.”\n\nA dream come true\n\nThe dream of Juan Diego Flórez when he started this project was to help disadvantaged children in Peru, and this dream is now being realised. However, exceeding his wildest expectations was an opportunity to take his orchestra on an extraordinary journey to the Festival of Salzburg, the most important in the world of classical music. He describes his unbridled joy.\n\n“The Salzburg concert is so important for the orchestra, because it’s the first time they really travel as a whole orchestra. It feels great to be close to the kids of Sinfonia por el Peru, to the youth orchestra to work with them, to rehearse very hard with them for the tour that we are doing in Europe, especially for the Festival of Salzburg. I’m so happy, I’m so happy to be close to them. It’s really amazing, really.”\n\nViola player Gabriel Vera Correa, describes his excitement at this opportunity.\n\n“I'm happy to be going to Salzburg and I'm excited that I'm going to be there with a lot more people who like what I do.”\n\nFor flutist Diana Espinoza, this is a very meaningful opportunity.\n\n“Knowing that Mozart was there, that Mozart lived there and knowing that it's the cradle of music and being able to walk through these little streets I can’t even describe my emotions.”\n\nWorld-famous tenor, Juan Diego Flórez, rehearsing with Youth Orchestra Euronews\n\nViolin player Diego Manrique, feels that this experience has implications that go beyond the musicians who are performing in Salzburg.\n\n“I’m really happy and grateful. It's like a dream that every kid in Sinfonía por el Peru would love to experience and we're representing them all.”\n\nSentiments that are echoed by the double bass player, Revoredo.\n\n“We’re not only representing the 5,000 kids of Sinfonía por el Peru, but also the whole of Peru, showing that Peru has talent.”\n\nFor Flórez, it represents an opportunity to inspire and to give hope to future generations of young musicians and young people in general. As he explains.\n\n“When they play in an orchestra, they feel, oh, I’m somebody. I am recognised. Imagine these kids now, they say, Yes, we made it. Nothing is impossible.”",
    "1,300-Year-Old Tomb of the “Lord of Huarmey” Excavated in Peru": "Friday, September 23, 2022\n\nHUARMEY, PERU—Live Science reports that researchers led by Miłosz Giersz of the University of Warsaw discovered a 1,300-year-old Wari tomb in a necropolis on Peru’s North Coast known as El Castillo de Huarmey. The tomb is thought to have belonged to a man who has been dubbed the “Lord of Huarmey,” although the remains of six other people were included in the burial. They are thought to have been buried at another site before they were reinterred in this tomb. The grave also held an abundance of gold and silver jewelry in various stages of completion, bronze tools, knives, axes, baskets, woven textiles, materials for making baskets, and wood and leather items. Giersz suggests that the tomb’s occupants may have been skilled craftspeople in addition to being members of the Wari elite. This tomb is located on top of a larger tomb Giersz and his colleagues discovered in 2012, which contained the remains of three high-status Wari women and 58 other people, some of whom may have been sacrificed. Giersz thinks the Castillo de Huarmey may have been an administrative center for the Wari Empire and a place of ancestor worship.

And it is a task that all of us who have a position of responsibility, are expected to live intensely as a service, especially in these times when we see enormous institutional disloyalty, a tendency to use institutions for particular interests and not in favor of the general interest which is the common good of the country\". These are the words pronounced by Monsignor Carlos Castillo, Archbishop of Lima and Primate of Peru, during the solemn Mass which he presided over for the Bicentennial of the Congress of the Republic, on September 20, which was attended by the Vice President of the Republic, Dina Boluarte, the President of the Congress of the Republic, José Williams Zapata, ministers, parliamentarians, civil, political and police authorities.\n\nThe Archbishop stressed that this situation occurs \"not only in State institutions or in various public institutions, it also exists in the Church, it also exists in private institutions where the possibility of building together a future. For this reason, the Holy Father, Francisco, exhorts us to social friendship, to work for the common good and to lay down those things that can prevent it\".\n\nTwo centuries ago, on September 20, 1822, at 10 am, those elected to form the Congress of the Republic gathered in the Government Palace and from there they went to the Cathedral of Lima to ask for divine assistance through the votive Mass of the Holy Spirit. \"That is why we are in a morning of remembrance - the Archbishop underlined -, because remembering is putting a past experience back at the center of our feelings, in the will we exercise and in the orientation that we must live towards the future. That is why, when we also remember those who have left us, especially in this Pandemic, we carry them in our hearts and we want to act in favor of all those who suffer. For this reason, today, we will also sing the Te Deum that was sung that day, September 20, 1822, and the Congress will also meet again to commemorate this event\".\n\nAmong those elected 200 years ago, there was also Francisco Javier de Luna Pizarro, who on three occasions was elected President of the Constituent Congress and later was Archbishop of Lima, one of the greatest intellectual and political figures in the country's history. Monsignor Castillo cited him in his homily, referring to the role of the representatives of the people and the construction of the Republic.\n\n\"Constituting a republic - according to de Luna Pizarro - is a very difficult job: we have to harmonize the heterogeneous elements that make up the political body; conflicting opinions must be agreed upon; combat interests unworthy of protection, which dare to present themselves in the form of public good ... \".\n\nAt the end of his homily, the Archbishop of Lima invoked the blessing of the Lord on the congressmen, so that they are united on the fundamental issues, proposing \"to think of a common program of fundamental points to be resolved, where we all agree\", and all the social and institutional realities, as well as the Church, can collaborate to solve them, especially hunger, which is one of the most serious current realities. \"United in elementary things - he concluded -, we can better understand each other in things that have to do directly with the theme and the difficulties of the national leadership\".\n\nSince 2016, Peru has been experiencing a political crisis due to the constant instability of leaders and power groups, and consequently of national governments, which has been aggravated by the Covid 19 pandemic with its strong health, economic and social consequences. Those who suffer most from this situation are the poorest and most vulnerable. In this climate, popular protests have not been lacking, with strikes, demonstrations and clashes. The Peruvian Bishops have spoken on several occasions on these issues, launching calls for peace and dialogue, appealing to political leaders to consider the situation and the task entrusted to them with greater responsibility, so that they put aside the selfishness and partisan interests, to fight against corruption, to agree on the necessary political reforms and to take radical measures (see Fides 22/4/2022; 6/4/2022; 4/4/2022).

    "Peru’s table grapes gain full market access to Japan": "The Peruvian table grapes industry is one step closer to landing its whole bunches in the Japanese market after MAFF officials from the Asian nation personally inspected orchards, pack houses and export facilities in Peru this week. This final step of verification inspections by Japan’s phytosanitary authority is to authorise the full export for 26 of the 30 table grape varieties requested by Peru, which have been allowed to enter the Japanese market.\n\nPeru will in the current 2022/2023 season start out by sending trial shipment of grapes to Japan. This is to prove the required uninterrupted 30 days cold chain as well as test the entire export processes.\n\nThe Japanese authorities are known to zoom in on the minutest details of phytosanitary measures thereby delaying market entry for several years. To reach this step is a big milestone for Peru’s table grape industry. The market access process reached the urgency last October when the Japanese were satisfied that all the phytosanitary details where cleared out to allow Peru’s table grape exports. This week’s verification visit was the final step for Peru to clear the last technical details to gain the green light to go ahead with sending grapes to Japan.\n\nThe Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Fish Farming of Japan inspectors, together with SENASA Peru officials visited the table grape farms of ECosac Grupo Costa del Sol. Hector Rubina Gastaneta, general manager of the company, based in Castilla District, Piura, Peru commented: “It has been an honour to participate in the efforts that are being made to finalize the access of Peruvian grapes to the Japanese market.”\n\nOther countries that have access to the exacting Japanese market include the US, Australia, Chile, Mexico and South Africa.\n\nFor more information:\n\nSENASA PERU\n\nTel: +51 (01) 313 3300\n\nEmail: mesadepartes@senasa.gob.pe\n\nwww.gob.pe/senasa",

    "PAHO says Brazil, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Peru at very high risk for polio as vaccination dwindles": "MEXICO CITY, Sept 21 (Reuters) - The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) on Wednesday said Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Peru are at very high risk for the reintroduction of polio, as dwindling vaccination rates during the coronavirus pandemic has led to historic lows in protection against the illness.\n\nRegional vaccine coverage for polio has fallen to about 79%, the lowest since 1994, PAHO said.\n\nEarlier this month, New York Governor Kathy Hochul declared a disaster emergency in a bid to accelerate efforts to vaccinate residents against polio after the virus was detected in wastewater samples taken in four counties. Cases also have been detected in London and Jerusalem. read more\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\n\"Lets be very clear,\" PAHO director Carissa Etienne told reporters. \"Polio is not a treatable disease. Prevention is the only option, and prevention is only possible with vaccines.\"\n\nPolio can cause irreversible paralysis in some cases, but can be prevented by a vaccine first made available in 1955. While there is no known cure, three injections of the vaccine provide nearly 100% immunity.\n\nEtienne said dwindling vaccination caused by the coronavirus pandemic had left many unprotected from polio, after vaccines had eradicated the disease in the region 30 years earlier.\n\nShe added that Argentina, the Bahamas, Ecuador, Panama, Suriname and Venezuela also had been identified as high-risk countries, and that nearly all of South America currently has vaccine coverage below 80%.\n\nThere are currently no confirmed polio cases in Latin America and the Caribbean, but PAHO urged all countries in the region to strengthen surveillance and proactively reach unvaccinated communities.\n\n\"I really cannot state this strongly enough,\" Etienne said. \"As we saw in New York state, the polio virus can appear and spread quickly and quietly in communities with insufficient vaccine coverage.\"\n\nPolio terrified parents around the world for the first half of the 20th century. Affecting mainly children under five, it is often asymptomatic but can also cause symptoms including fever and vomiting. Around one in 200 infections leads to irreversible paralysis, and among those patients, up to 10% die. read more\n\n(Add dropped words at end of first paragraph)\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nReporting by Sarah Morland; Writing by Anthony Esposito; Editing by Christian Plumb and Bill Berkrot\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
    "NC Rotary Club hears update on Peru State College Criminal justice program – Nebraska City News Press": "Future law enforcement leaders in Nebraska have a unique educational opportunity available at Peru State College.\n\nShawn Sherman, workforce liaison at Peru State College, visited the Nebraska City Rotary Club Sept. 21 to provide the club with an update on the college’s Corrections Leadership Program and its criminal justice major.\n\nCriminal justice students can apply for the Corrections Leadership Program scholarship and earn up to $15,000 per year toward the cost of their degree by attending PSC full time and working at the Tecumseh State Correctional Institution.\n\nSherman said the scholarship program was devised to help with workforce issues at the Tecumseh facility. Gov. Pete Ricketts, Nebraska State College System Chancellor Dr. Paul Turman, and former Peru State College President Dr. Dan Hanson were involved in creating the scholarship program.\n\nStudents on any of the three criminal justice study tracks—justice administration, justice counseling, or justice legal studies—can qualify for the scholarship. Twenty-six students are enrolled in the program for the current school year, said Sherman, and there is no requirement that the students remain with the Department of Corrections upon graduation.\n\n“I want every student to be successful,” he said, “and my hope is that we keep them in law enforcement in Nebraska.”\n\nMost of the students in the program are from Nebraska, said Sherman, and they are eligible to work for the Department of Corrections after completing their freshman year of study at Peru State, provided they meet other eligible requirements of the department.\n\nSherman said there are no equivalent programs anywhere else in the United States, and he has begun to field phone calls from other colleges asking for information about how they can start similar programs.\n\nBefore joining the Peru State staff, Sherman worked at the Tecumseh State Correctional Institution as the facility intelligence team leader, correctional sergeant, key control corporal, armory sergeant, correctional emergency response team commander, correctional lieutenant, emergency preparedness supervisor, unit administrator, and unit manager.\n\nHe is retired from the U.S. Army Reserves and holds a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice administration from Peru State College.\n\nThe Nebraska City Rotary Club meets at noon Wednesday at Valentino’s, 1710 S. 11th St. Guests pay $9 for lunch.\n\nThe scheduled speaker for tomorrow (Sept. 28) will be Dr. Michael Evans, who will discuss the upcoming construction projects at Peru State College.\n\nThe Oct. 5 topic is scheduled to be winter natural gas prices, and the Oct. 12 speaker is scheduled to be Melissa Turner, who will discuss bank fraud and ways consumers can protect themselves from being scammed.\n\nOn Oct. 19, the guest speaker is scheduled to be Megan Feeney, editor of Nebraska Life Magazine.\n\nCole Sharp is the club president.

    "Sierra Metals halts 2022 production and finance guidance on Peru mine blockade": "Mine production remains halted with activities limited to critical operations to ensure proper safety and maintenance, Sierra Metals said.\n\nThe Toronto-based miner noted that due to uncertainty around how long it will take to solve the dispute and the potential delay in the progressive restart of production at Yauricocha, 2022 production and financial guidance have also been suspended.\n\nCompany representatives have taken part in conversations with members of the group and are also studying requests organized by the Peruvian government.\n\nSierra Metals said it remained committed to the social development of its host communities, adding that it was working towards “a peaceful and expeditious resolution” of the situation.\n\n“As a road blockade is a matter of public concern, the company has involved the local authorities for their mediation and assistance in resolving this matter,” it said in the statement.\n\nYauricocha is an underground mine located in western central Peru in the Yauyos province at an average altitude of 4,600 meters.\n\nLast produced 31.8 million pounds of copper and 79.3 million pounds of zinc.\n\nConflicts on the rise\n\nMining conflicts are on the rise in Peru, the world’s No. 2 copper producer and an important producer of zinc, as empowered local communities are upping demands under the administration of leftist President Pedro Castillo, in power since July 2021.\n\nEarlier this year, a wave of protests hit the country’s major operations, including Glencore’s (LON: GLEN) Antapaccay, the country’s sixth largest copper mine. Other operations affected were Southern Copper Corp’s Cuajone mine and MMG’s giant Las Bambas mine, which is the nation’s fourth-largest copper mine and the world’s ninth-largest.\n\nCopper is a hot commodity due to its role in the world’s decarbonization, with experts predicting that demand for the orange metal relating to energy transition activities — clean power and electrified transport, and the infrastructure supporting them — will grow about 4% per year between now and 2040.\n\nTraditional copper consumers, such as construction and manufacturing of heating and cooling equipment will increase their need for copper only 1.5% per year over the same period.\n\nGoldman Sachs expects global demand for copper will begin to outstrip supplies by 2025, pushing prices to twice their current level.",
