    "Shadow minister‚Äôs border poll remarks alarm Northern Ireland‚Äôs unionists": "Northern Ireland unionists have expressed alarm after the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Kyle, said he would be prepared to call a referendum on Irish unity if certain conditions were met.\n\nKyle would set out the criteria for calling a border poll if Labour were in power, he told the BBC‚Äôs Sunday Politics show at his party‚Äôs conference.\n\n‚ÄúIf the circumstances emerge as set out in the Good Friday agreement, I as secretary of state, would not play games. I would call the border poll,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI am saying I am not going to be a barrier if the circumstances emerge.‚Äù\n\nUnder the 1998 agreement, a secretary of state must call a referendum if it appears likely a majority of those voting would want the region to leave the UK ‚Äì but the agreement does not specify the criteria, a vagueness that the UK government and unionists have been keen to maintain.\n\nThe Irish government, Sinn F√©in and the Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP) have pushed for clarity on the criteria, which would lay out the steps needed for a vote that could abolish the state of Northern Ireland and unify the island.\n\nKyle said Sinn F√©in‚Äôs emergence as the biggest party in Northern Ireland and last week‚Äôs census results, which showed Catholics outnumbering Protestants, did not suffice. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not even in that circumstance yet, so when we move towards the point where those circumstances set out in the Good Friday agreement start to emerge and it becomes a priority for the people of Northern Ireland, I will act,‚Äù he said.\n\nOn Monday the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) leader, Doug Beattie, criticised the comments as an ‚Äúunhelpful and ill-timed‚Äù distraction from the cost of living crisis and other problems facing Northern Ireland.\n\nThe pro-union Belfast News Letter newspaper said the Labour politician had muddied the waters on a border poll and that it was essential any UK government kept wide discretion. It said: ‚ÄúIt is unfortunate that Mr Kyle has chosen this time to give succour to those who want to shatter the UK.‚Äù\n\nThe Sinn F√©in MP Chris Hazzard welcomed Kyle‚Äôs comments as recognition that the current position was ‚Äúunsustainable‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs having your head in the sand simply to deny the fact that constitutional change is coming, that people are talking about this, civic society and political parties and all around us,‚Äù the South Down MP said.\n\nSign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

    "Conor McMenamin: Northern Ireland winger cleared over historical video in which he appeared to sing a pro-IRA slogan": "Conor McMenamin has been cleared to play in Northern Ireland's Nations League match against Greece on Tuesday as he will face no further action regarding a historical video in which he appeared to sing a pro-IRA slogan.\n\nThe 27-year-old Glentoran winger was withdrawn from Ian Baraclough's squad shortly before Saturday's 2-1 win over Kosovo after the video emerged.\n\nHowever, given that the footage is believed to be almost a decade old and the former Cliftonville and Linfield player was punished by his club at the time, the Irish FA allowed him to travel to Athens on Sunday while an independent disciplinary committee considered whether he had breached IFA rules.\n\nMcMenamin has now been cleared and joined his team-mates in training on Monday evening ahead of the crunch fixture against Greece, in which Northern Ireland need to avoid defeat to be sure of not dropping into a relegation play-off.\n\nMcMenamin was withdrawn a day after striker Kyle Lafferty was sent home amid an investigation by his club Kilmarnock into a video appearing to show him using alleged sectarian language, but that was understood to have been recorded only last week.\n\nImage: McMenamin (right) has played three times for Northern Ireland\n\nMcMenamin's reinstatement for the Greece game will give him the opportunity to add to the three caps he earned in June after an outstanding season with Glentoran last term was rewarded with his first international call-up.\n\nSpeaking after Saturday's 2-1 win over Kosovo, Northern Ireland manager Baraclough had said he hoped historic videos would not become a recurring problem for the team.\n\n\"It's a distraction you'd rather not have,\" Baraclough said. \"To happen so close to kick-off time, I thought we did the right things in pulling Conor out of the squad. It needs to be looked at.\n\n\"Clearly it's a historic video from social media from when he was 16 I think. I'm not sure where it's going to go at this time.\n\n\"You just hope that it isn't (something that continues) and things don't get churned up. I'd rather leave it at that and not elaborate on it too much. I was trying to concentrate on a game of football and that's what we did.\n\n\"It's been tough for the boys because if you lose two members of the squad, you know they get close and they don't like to see that happen to anyone. It could have played a major factor but they rallied and got a result.\"\n\nAhead of Tuesday's match against Greece, Baraclough said on Monday it had been the right decision to keep McMenamin out of the Kosovo game, but that he was delighted to have him available again.\n\n\"I don't think we could take any chances as an association in light of what had happened a couple of days previously with Kyle (Lafferty),\" he said. \"The decision was taken, we see where it went, the disciplinary committee looked at that and now he is free to be with us tomorrow night which is good news.\n\n\"We couldn't be sure until we looked into it and that's what's been done. I think that was right. It was hard telling the lad, hard to give him the information and to deny him being with the squad and possibly making another cap but it was the right thing to be done.\"\n\nImage: Kyle Lafferty was sent home from Northern Ireland duty amid an investigation by his club Kilmarnock into a video appearing to show him using alleged sectarian language\n\nLafferty was sent home from the squad on Friday after a video emerged of him appearing to use an alleged sectarian slur in an altercation with fans, sparking an investigation from his club Kilmarnock. The 35-year-old remains absent with that investigation ongoing.\n\nBaraclough confirmed the incident was believed to have happened after he had taken the players out for dinner last Tuesday evening as part of a team-bonding exercise, but said he had no regrets about doing so.\n\n\"We all went out, we all went to the restaurant and we all came back,\" he said. \"The players had a day off the next day, they're adults and they know they've got a responsibility. When they're away on international duty they're representing themselves, their clubs, their families and me.\n\n\"We can't keep them cooped up in a hotel, we've got to give them a certain amount of trust and hope that's the right thing to do.\n\n\"It might be something we have to look at but it's always served Northern Ireland teams well when we've had that time together. It was something we weren't expecting, to wake up to those sorts of headlines and that sort of news. It was disappointing.\"",

In addition to a 15-year lease for a newly built warehouse in Doncaster in the North of England, Maersk has signed a lease for two new distribution centres in the Irish capital Dublin. All the facilities have a strong focus on their operations creating low CO2 emissions. The Doncaster facility is part of the G Park Doncaster Mammoth 602 development and perfectly connected via road (close to five motorways), rail (Doncaster International Railport), and air (Robin Hood Airport). With more than 600,000 sq ft total space, 60 dock levellers, 20m internal clear height as well as several hundred parking spaces and offices the warehouse is one of the largest in UK. It ranks also among the most sustainable logistics buildings in the North of England. The developer GLP has built the facility on a net zero carbon scheme for construction (within the UKGBC framework). In addition to the warehouse in Doncaster, Maersk‚Äôs portfolio comprises two other distribution centers in the UK in Tamworth and Kettering.\n\nIn Ireland, Maersk has signed a lease for renting two new warehouses in the Quantum Logistics Park in the North of Dublin. The units 3 and 4 within Quantum Logistics Park will feature a combined space of 250,000 sq ft and will be built to fulfill the sustainability standards of LEED Gold and BREEAM Excellent ratings. The Dublin based developer IPUT Real Estate will complete the two warehouses in Q4 2022 and Q2 2023, while unit 4 will also become Ireland‚Äôs first net zero logistics building using a glue-laminated timber structural frame. Quantum Logistics Park is strategically located 2 km from Dublin airport and 15 km from Dublin port with immediate access to the M2 motorway.\n\nThese three new warehouses in the UK and Ireland are a strong statement that we are ready to deliver on our integrator promise to our customers and serve them with end-to-end logistics solutions from factory to their end-consumers if they wish. The demand for integrated and thus more resilient supply chains has grown significantly over the past two years. The disruptions of Brexit and the pandemic moved the logistics from a commodity level to a C-level topic ‚Äì where it actually belongs. Gary Jeffreys Area Managing Director UK & Ireland\n\nAs decarbonization of sea, air and land logistics by 2040 is an integral part of Maersk‚Äôs strategy, we are happy to partner with two very capable developers which help us to deliver on that ambitious goal in landside logistics. Following the successful acquisition of the warehousing specialist LF Logistics in Asia, Maersk today offers its customers integrated logistics solutions in more than 550 warehouses with a total global space of around 9.5 million sqm.

As an integrator of logistics, Maersk is developing and providing solutions ranging from ocean transportation to landside and air transportation, contract logistics including warehousing & distribution (W&D) and depots, custom clearances, visibility solutions and more. When supply chains were impacted due to the disruptions caused by the pandemic, Maersk‚Äôs resilient end-to-end solutions ensured customers‚Äô cargo kept moving. The integrated solutions allow Maersk to have greater control over the movement of the cargo at multiple stages of its journey and thus bring resilience to the supply chains. With the expansion of W&D facilities, Maersk is strengthening its position further by providing a larger array of services out of one hand to its customers. About A.P. Moller - Maersk A.P.

U.S. President Joe Biden has warned against disrupting peace in Northern Ireland, and the two leaders discussed the issue at their first in-person meeting Wednesday.\n\n\"What's important is that we protect and respect the positions of both the nationalist community in Northern Ireland as well as the unionist community in Northern Ireland,\" Truss said Sunday.\n\nTruss is also facing rising tensions from Commonwealth nations around the globe following the death of Queen Elizabeth II, which has reignited debates over whether the nations should sever ties with the British monarchy.\n\nTruss said she has seen an \"outpouring of love and affection\" for the late Queen, and she is very supportive of the Commonwealth.\n\n\"I think the Commonwealth is a force for good,\" she said. \"It's a believer in freedom and democracy, and we need more of that in a world where we are facing these authoritarian regimes who want to subvert those ideas.\"",

    "Emerging Ireland Squad: Meet the Players": "The Emerging Ireland squad that will compete in the Toyota Challenge in Bloemfontein over the next two weeks features a host of players that have starred for Ireland at underage level and on the world stage for the Ireland Sevens. Fourteen were part of the IRFU‚Äôs National Talent Squad programme and the majority have already made a breakthrough at senior level for their Provinces.\n\nThe Capped Players\n\nMax Deegan was named Player of the Tournament after helping the Ireland U20s to the final of the 2016 U20 World Rugby Championships. He was capped by Ireland against Wales in the 2020 Six Nations Championships and despite some serious injury setbacks, has amassed 85 senior caps for Leinster.\n\nShane Daly has two caps for Ireland, making his senior debut against Georgia in the 2020 Autumn Nations Cup. A former Ireland Sevens international, he has 49 senior caps for Munster.\n\nRobert Baloucoune is another former Ireland Sevens international who has two senior international caps having made his debut against the USA in July 2021.

He played for the Ireland U20s in 2020 and has made 32 senior appearances for Connacht.\n\nJoe McCarthy also played in both fixtures against the Maori All Blacks on the 2022 New Zealand Tour and played Ireland U20s with Prendergast in 2020. The second row has made 13 senior appearances for Leinster.\n\nThe Development Brief\n\nBoth Tom Ahern and Jamie Osborne trained with the Ireland squad as Development Players ahead of the 2021 Autumn Nations Series. Ahern was an Ireland U20 international in 2019 and 2020 missing the Grand Slam campaign through injury. He has made 21 senior appearances for Munster\n\nOsborne represented the Ireland U20s in 2021 but had already made his senior Leinster debut at that stage. He has made 20 senior appearances for Leinster.\n\nProven Provincials\n\nStewart Moore, Calvin Nash and Diarmuid Barron have all established themselves as senior Provincial players. All three represented Ireland at U20 World Rugby Championships.\n\nSince making his senior debut for Ulster in December 2019, Moore has accumulated 32 senior appearances. Nash has played 38 senior games for Munster, while Barron has 36 senior Munster caps.\n\nThe Class of 2019\n\nJohn Hodnett, Scott Penny, David McCann, Dylan Tierney-Martin, Brian Deeny, Jake Flannery, Thomas Clarkson, Michael Milne, Callum Reid and Josh Wycherley were all part of Ireland‚Äôs U20 Six Nations Grand Slam winning squad in 2019.\n\nAt Munster, Hodnett and Wycherley have made 22 and 29 senior provincial appearances respectively while Flannery made six senior appearances for Munster before making the switch to Ulster this season. McCann, who captained the U20s the following year, has made 15 senior appearances for Ulster with Reid clocking 11 appearances to date.\n\nTierney-Martin has made eight senior appearances for Connacht and scored a try against the Stormers at the weekend. Penny has made the most senior appearances for Leinster with 42 with Milne (18), Clarkson (18) and Deeny (3) also making the breakthrough at senior level for Leo Cullen‚Äôs side.\n\nThe Sevens Boys\n\nBaloucoune and Daly are not the only two players in the Emerging Ireland squad that have benefitted from exposure to the Ireland Sevens programme.\n\nAndrew Smith and Chay Mullins both won bronze medals at the recent Rugby World Cup Sevens in Cape Town while Cormac Izuchukwu won two Ireland Sevens caps before clocking nine senior appearances for Ulster.\n\nSmith also won the Energia AIL title with Clontarf earlier this year and has made two senior appearances for Leinster. Mullins has joined the Connacht Academy this season having also helped the Ireland U20s to a 2022 Six Nations Grand Slam.\n\nThe 2020 Triple Crowners\n\nThe 2020 U20 Six Nations was cut short by the Covid pandemic but after three games the Ireland U20 squad had secured wins over Scotland, Wales and England, claiming an unofficial Triple Crown. Ethan McIlroy, Jack Crowley, Tom Stewart and Ben Murphy were in that squad alongside the aforementioned Smith, McCann, Prendergast, Ahern and McCarthy.\n\nMcIlroy has made 37 senior appearances for Ulster while Stewart‚Äôs progress has been hampered by injury but he claimed an impressive try against Connacht in the first round of this season‚Äôs URC.\n\nOut-half Crowley has notched up 16 senior appearances for Munster including a start in the Champions Cup against Castres. Murphy has also made his senior debut for Leinster having gone on loan to Munster during the 2021/22 season.\n\nThe Class of 2021\n\nIn 2021, the U20 Six Nations took place in the summer months of June and July as the global pandemic continued to disrupt the rugby calender. Osborne featured strongly for the Richie Murphy‚Äôs side but so too did Nathan Doak, Cathal Forde and Sam Illo.\n\nDoak has already made a big impact at senior provincial level with Ulster clocking up 24 appearances since making his debut against Munster in December 2020. Forde has made two senior appearances for Connacht while Illo has featured three times since switching from the Leinster age grade system.\n\nInternational IQ Rugby\n\nThere are three players in the squad that have come through the Irish qualified player pathway. Mullins came via the Bristol Academy and the IRFU‚Äôs IQ programme in the UK.\n\nMichael McDonald was born in Ireland but represented Australia U20s at the 2019 U20 World Rugby Championship having emigrated down under with his family at the age of 13. He joined Ulster at the start of the current season.\n\nAntoine Frisch was born in France but qualifies for Ireland via his grandmother. He joined Munster this season from Premiership side Bristol Bears and made his Munster debut against Cardiff in the opening URC fixture of the 2022/23 season.\n\nRoman Salanoa was born in Hawaii but has qualified to play for Ireland through residency. He represented the USA at the 2016 U20 World Rugby Championship. Originally part of the Leinster development programme, Salanoa subsequently joined Munster and has made 10 senior appearances to date.\n\nNew Kid on the Block\n\nJames Culhane is yet to make his senior debut for Leinster but the powerful number eight left his mark on the 2022 U20 Six Nations. He was named Player of the Tournament as Ireland secured a memorable Grand Slam.",
    "Do you agree with our Ireland team to face Armenia?": "Goalkeeper/defence\n\nGavin Bazunu will retain his place in the side barring any last-minute injuries. Mark Travers is the man most likely to come in on the off chance that happens.\n\nThe back three all did relatively well against Scotland and so it would be a surprise if Kenny made changes. That said, there could be an outside chance Shane Duffy plays given his prowess from set pieces ‚Äî Ireland will need as many goal threats as possible on the pitch against a team that are likely to sit back and play a blanket defence at times.\n\nWing-backs\n\nMatt Doherty looked tired on occasions during the Scotland game, which is perhaps not a surprise, given that he has yet to start a competitive match for Spurs this season. Yet the alternate options aren‚Äôt strong ‚Äî 33-year-old Seamus Coleman‚Äôs days of playing 90 minutes/starting in that physically demanding role are probably behind him, and as well as he did for the games in June in Doherty‚Äôs absence, Alan Browne is not a natural wing-back and so picking him there ahead of the Tottenham man would be a big and somewhat controversial call.\n\nJames McClean did okay at the weekend and put in the corner for Ireland‚Äôs goal, but against a side as conservative as the Armenians, Kenny may favour the guile of Robbie Brady over the physicality and work rate of the Wigan star.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMidfield\n\nJosh Cullen is suspended so it will be a rare case of an Ireland game where the Burnley man is absent from the starting XI. There are a couple of candidates to come in but Conor Hourihane is perhaps the most natural replacement in that slightly deeper midfield role. His ability on set pieces against a side that may prove difficult to unlock is another factor working in his favour.\n\nIt was no surprise Kenny went for the energy of Jason Knight and Jayson Molumby in a game as combative as the Scotland fixture inevitably was going to be. However, the Irish boss might be tempted to play someone else in what will be a very different type of game.\n\nJeff Hendrick is arguably better than any other Irish midfielder in the squad at producing an incisive, defence-splitting through pass and with this in mind, it would be no surprise to see the 30-year-old ‚Äî who has made 10 appearances for a Reading team currently third in the Championship ‚Äî start the game. Alan Browne is another who could come in if Kenny seeks to freshen things up further, though the exuberance of Knight might be considered a better fit alongside two midfielders who are the wrong side of 30.\n\nCallum O‚ÄôDowda will likely have to settle for a place on the bench again, though his dribbling ability may prove useful at some point in proceedings.\n\nAttack\n\nProbably the area of the pitch with the tightest calls. When it comes to the Scotland game, Troy Parrott unfortunately will be most remembered for his costly miss when one-on-one with the goalkeeper, but the Preston loanee did well in general play, with some nice touches and a good work rate off the ball.\n\nMichael Obafemi also caught the eye and caused the Scottish defence problems with his pace, movement and eye for a pass.

    "Shifting demographics stirs debate on Northern Ireland‚Äôs future": "New census figures show that Catholics outnumber Protestants in Northern Ireland for the first time ever.\n\nFor the first time in Northern Ireland‚Äôs history, new census figures show that Catholics outnumber Protestants.\n\nThe results have been described as ‚Äúa seminal moment‚Äù by leaders of Irish republican parties ‚Äì who favour the reunification of Ireland and draw most of their votes from the Catholic population, and have caused disquiet in unionist camps ‚Äì who want to remain in the United Kingdom and are supported mostly by Protestants.\n\nWhile most of the island of Ireland gained independence from the UK a century ago, Northern Ireland was carved out in a way which explicitly aimed to maintain a permanent majority of pro-British Protestants.\n\nFor some, the new figures are thus another sign on the pathway to a united Ireland.\n\nJohn Finucane, a prominent member of the leading republican party Sinn Fein, called for preparations for the ‚Äúpossibility of a unity referendum‚Äù.\n\n‚ÄúThe partition of Ireland has been a failure. We can build a better future together, for every person who lives on this island,‚Äù the MP said upon the announcement of the results.\n\nComplex picture\n\nHowever, caution is required when interpreting the results and their political applications, Peter McLoughlin, a senior lecturer in political history at Queens University Belfast, told Al Jazeera.\n\nPeople from a Catholic background are not a majority of the total population, and nor do they all necessarily support a united Ireland.\n\n‚ÄúWhile we can say there is a very strong link between religion and political orientation, there are exceptions to the rule on both sides,‚Äù McLoughlin said.\n\nNonetheless, Northern Ireland‚Äôs history means that the fact that Catholics are now the larger group is clearly ‚Äúsymbolically and historically important‚Äù and will add to unrest among unionist political parties who have seen their position change in years.\n\nIn 2017, unionist parties lost their majority for the first time in the local legislature.\n\nEarlier this year, Sinn Fein gained the largest number of seats in the May elections, the first time a republican party has managed to do so.\n\nAnother worrying trend for unionists is that the number of people who defined their identity as ‚ÄúBritish only‚Äù dropped by 8 percent since the last poll in 2011.\n\nIt was noticeable that both main unionist parties briefed the media to downplay the significance of the results before they were even announced.\n\nWhat is clear is that unionists ‚Äì or indeed, Irish republicans ‚Äì will need to reach beyond those who identify as Catholic or British, Irish or British, in order to have enough support for their cause.\n\nMiddle ground\n\nAbout one in five people identify as ‚ÄúNorthern Irish‚Äù and may well support parties like Alliance, who do not take a stance on reunification and made significant gains in elections this May.\n\nKellie Armstrong, a representative of the Alliance party in the local legislature, told Al Jazeera that the census figures demonstrate that many people like her do not want to be ‚Äúpigeonholed‚Äù as British or Irish.\n\n‚ÄúIt just shows that we‚Äôre no longer a place of two parts, that we are actually a more pluralist and a much more diverse Northern Ireland,‚Äù she said.\n\nAny referendum on Irish unity ‚Äúwill be a lot more nuanced and it will be people like myself, people who are Northern Irish, the people who have not defined themselves by religious terms, that will actually decide whether there should be a border poll [referendum], and what that border poll like outcome will be‚Äù, Armstrong said.\n\nGrowing diversity\n\nThe census also shows the small but growing part of the population who are from Black or minority ethnic backgrounds or have migrated to Northern Ireland from the EU and elsewhere.\n\nThose from a minority ethnic background now make up 3.6 percent of the population ‚Äì four times what it was in 2001 at the end of the 30-year armed conflict, and more than 100,000 people recorded their place of birth as outside of Northern Ireland.\n\nWhile most people speak English, more people now speak Polish or Lithuanian than the indigenous languages, Irish or Ulster Scots.\n\nHowever, a parliamentary inquiry from earlier this year found that politics is not keeping pace with this change, stating that ‚Äúminority communities have often been overlooked in Northern Ireland‚Äù.\n\nThe report found that a perceived priority given to issues facing the main Catholic and Protestant communities means that this can ‚Äúsqueeze out‚Äù attention for minority ethnic and migrant communities, often seen as ‚Äúother‚Äù.\n\nNorthern Ireland also grapples with disproportionately high levels of hate crime ‚Äì where perpetrators are rarely brought to court.\n\nHate crime\n\nThe Belfast Multi-Cultural Association (BMCA) was fire-bombed in a hate crime attack in May, the day before they were due to reopen after a previous fire-bomb attack in 2021.\n\n‚ÄúVery often Black and ethnic minority communities are often left out of conversations‚Äù, said Coumilah Manjoo of the BCMA.\n\n‚ÄúThe census data is significant, it shows that the population is now more diverse than ever, the languages we speak is more diverse.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúEven with the census data, people seem to be far more interested with the ‚Äògreen and orange‚Äô [Catholic and Protestant] side of things. We have to move beyond that rhetoric.‚Äù",
    "Scotland 2-1 Republic of Ireland: Ryan Christie's late penalty gives hosts crucial win": "Last updated on .From the section Football\n\nRyan Christie scoring his late penalty for Scotland\n\nScotland need a point away to Ukraine on Tuesday to win Nations League Group B1 after a dogged comeback victory over the Republic of Ireland at Hampden.\n\nJohn Egan volleyed Ireland ahead early on, but Jack Hendry's header levelled.\n\nBoth sides spurned big chances before Alan Browne was penalised for handball and Ryan Christie stroked home the penalty winner eight minutes from time.\n\nThat puts Steve Clarke's side two points clear of Ukraine, who briefly went top with a 5-0 win in Armenia.\n\nHowever, Scotland head into their final group game in Krakow, Poland, with more injury worries after full-backs Kieran Tierney and Aaron Hickey were both forced off, while a late yellow card for Scott McTominay rules the midfielder out through suspension.\n\nIreland, meanwhile, can now finish no higher than third in the group.\n\nScotland were buoyed by Wednesday's 3-0 win over Ukraine at Hampden. But with that dominant performance came expectation they would simply roll over an Irish side who three months earlier had handed them a chastening 3-0 defeat.\n\nAnd a loud and confident Hampden was silenced when Troy Parrott slalomed through the Scotland defence and hammered the ball high into the net. The assistant referee's flag cut short the celebrations, but Ireland were again threatening to spring a shock.\n\nSoon the visitors broke on the counter-attack and got two v two. Hendry blocked Parrott's effort, but it only delayed the opener.\n\nSet-plays had been Scotland's downfall in Dublin and the frailty resurfaced. They struggled to clear a corner, the ball fell to Egan who lashed the ball through a ruck of bodies and past Craig Gordon.\n\nClarke's men had fallen apart in Dublin, but this time they responded strongly. The ball wouldn't fall for Stuart Armstrong and Lyndon Dykes in the box, while John McGinn mis-hit a shot wide, but the anticipation around Hampden was rising as the home side continued to pour forward.\n\nAnd four minutes into the second half Scotland were level. Matt Doherty allowed Christie to breeze past him all too easily, and Hendry met his delivery to guide a header into the far corner via the post.\n\nDoherty could have made amends at the other end when Greg Taylor was caught in possession, but he curled wide. Scotland's McGinn thumped past the post too as the game promised another goal.\n\nAnd that should have arrived when Ireland pulled the hosts apart. From Scotland's corner, Callum McGregor coughed up possession, the Irish broke two on one, Michael Obafemi laid the ball into the path of Parrott who saw the whites of Gordon's eyes but shot straight at him.\n\nThen a Gordon clearance bounced off Chiedozie Ogbene but back into the hands of the grateful goalkeeper. It was all Scotland possession, but Ireland were the ones passing up the chances.\n\nThe momentum shifted again in Scotland's favour. Ryan Fraser had a shot tipped over and Doherty defended brilliantly to head the ball away from McTominay.\n\nJust as Scotland's frustration grew as the winner looked to elude them, they were gifted a penalty when the hand of Browne diverted the ball from McTominay's path in the box.\n\nAfter a video assistant referee check, Christie slotted the penalty down the middle to bring Hampden to its feet. Ireland threw everything at Scotland in an attempt to find an equaliser but found a defence just as desperate to hold on.\n\nMan of the match - Jack Hendry\n\nHis defensive performance alone was enough to win the award, but he capped it with the equaliser to get Scotland back into the match\n\nDogged Scotland find a way - analysis\n\nIt was not the same flowing football from Wednesday, but the 90 minutes was just as pulsating as Scotland made it three straight wins.\n\nScotland's joy against Ukraine had come from their marauding full-backs and clever movement up front.\n\nTactically, though, Ireland were smart. Their two strikers pinned Scotland's wide players back, they defended their corners where Scotland had late joy in midweek. And despite Scotland having the lion's share of possession the Irish repeatedly found opportunities of their own.\n\nIt was a match that could have gone either way, but a penalty settled it.\n\nScotland did not have it all their own way as they did on Wednesday, but the confidence will be sky high before their rematch with Ukraine on Tuesday where Nations League promotion and a Euro 2024 play-off place are at stake.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nGroup B1 concludes on Tuesday, as Scotland take on Ukraine in Krakow, Poland (19:45 BST) and Republic of Ireland host Armenia at the same time.\n\n'Mentality doesn't change for Ukraine game' - Clarke\n\nMatch stats\n\nScotland are unbeaten in all eight of their home games in the Nations League (W7 D1) - no team has played more at home without ever losing in the competition (Italy also 8).\n\nRepublic of Ireland are winless in all seven of their away games in the competition (D2 L5), losing each of the last four.\n\nBoth teams scored with their first shots on target - for Scotland it was just the second time they'd conceded first in a home game in the Nations League (also v Israel in 2018), while it was the first time Ireland had scored first in an away game in the competition.\n\nIn his 33rd appearance for Scotland, Ryan Christie both scored and assisted a goal in the same game for the first time at international level.\n\nJack Hendry completed all 60 of his passes - the most a player has made while maintaining a 100% pass accuracy in this edition of the Nations League.\n\nJohn McGinn has created more chances (12) and had more shots (19) than any other Scotland player at this edition of the Nations League, with the midfielder having a further three of each against Ireland.",

    "EU Cohesion Policy: ‚Ç¨1.4 billion for Ireland's economic and social development and green transition in 2021-2027": "Ireland will benefit from ‚Ç¨1.4 billion in Cohesion Policy funding between 2021-2027 to support the sustainable development of its economy.\n\nThe details and strategy for these investments are set out in the Partnership Agreement between Ireland and the Commission that is formally launched today.\n\nThese EU funds will help Ireland address regional disparities by boosting innovation and competitiveness, enabling the economy's digital transformation, investing in social inclusion, skills training and employment, and in the green transition.\n\nGreen transition, innovation and cross-border cooperation\n\n‚Ç¨396 million from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) will strengthen regional innovation ecosystems by improving the capacities of the newly created ‚ÄòTechnical Universities', which will function as regional knowledge hubs. Funds will also be invested to increase energy efficiency in housing, thereby helping families at risk of energy poverty, whilst contributing to the green and fair transition.\n\nERDF will also be of a great help for the revitalisation of town centres. The investments will improve the appearance and livability of medium sized and smaller towns in Ireland, in line with the principles of the New European Bauhaus.\n\nAdditionally, ‚Ç¨293 million will be allocated to European cross-border cooperation programmes for joint development and peace activities in the Northern Periphery and Atlantic areas and with Northwest Europe.\n\nFinally, ‚Ç¨84 million from the Just Transition Fund (JTF) will support Ireland's Midlands addressing the impact of the transition out of peat for electricity generation.\n\nEmployment and social inclusion\n\n‚Ç¨508 million from the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) will contribute to the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan and contribute to achieving EU-level social headline targets.\n\nOver half of the ESF+ envelope will contribute to reducing the risk of poverty and social exclusion, with an emphasis on disadvantaged groups. More than 20,000 vulnerable children will benefit from improved access to social services tailor-made to their individual needs. To facilitate the social and employment integration of disadvantaged communities of people with a migrant background, the ESF+ will also finance mentoring, language and social skills training.\n\nESF+ funding will also improve the chances of people to get a job by providing training to up-and reskill, lifelong learning, and education measures. There will be a focus on assisting people who face greater challenges on the labour market, including over 6,000 persons with disabilities. In total, the programme aims to help 90,000 jobseekers to participate in a training course to develop new skills by 2029.\n\nSustainable fisheries, aquaculture and processing sector\n\nAround ‚Ç¨142 million from the European Maritime Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund (EMFAF) will enable the adaptation of the Irish fishing and aquaculture sectors to the present challenges. The funding will support the implementation of the Common Fisheries Policy, the growth of a sustainable blue economy and healthy, safe and sustainably management of seas and oceans. Investments in the fisheries and aquaculture sectors will also contribute to the green transition in Ireland, by promoting development of small-scale coastal fisheries through community-led local development.\n\nMembers of the College said:\n\nCommissioner for Cohesion and Reforms, Elisa Ferreira, said: ‚ÄúFollowing today's adoption of the Partnership Agreement, Ireland will receive support to further develop its economy in a fair and green manner, ensuring that no region is left behind. Since its accession to the EU in 1973, the country has benefitted from Cohesion Policy funds to support its transformation to a modern, innovation-led economy. Support under this new Partnership Agreement will continue to boost innovation across Irish regions, while also contributing to the green transition and to the quality of life in Irish towns. Ireland has a far-reaching smart, green and digital future ahead.‚Äù\n\nCommissioner for Jobs and Social Rights, Nicolas Schmit, added: ‚ÄúIn these challenging times, having a fair and inclusive labour market and society is more important than ever. The ESF+ will make a positive difference in the everyday life of people in Ireland, especially focusing on those who need extra support, helping them to find new jobs, learn innovative skills and protecting them from poverty and social exclusion.‚Äù\n\nCommissioner for Environment, Oceans and Fisheries, Virginijus Sinkeviƒçius, said: ‚ÄúThis Partnership Agreement will create favourable conditions to support the development of a sustainable blue economy in the coastal, island and inland areas of Ireland. It will play a central role in increasing the resilience of fishing and aquaculture sectors, while enhance the protection of the marine environment and biodiversity. It will also support coastal communities and contribute to Ireland's pledge for a carbon neutral economy by 2050.‚Äù\n\nBackground\n\nUnder Cohesion Policy, and in cooperation with the Commission, each Member State prepares a Partnership Agreement, a strategic document for programming investments from the Cohesion Policy funds ‚Äì ERDF, ESF+, and the Cohesion Fund ‚Äì the JTF and the EMFAF during the Multiannual Financial Framework.\n\nThe Partnership Agreements focus on EU priorities, laying down the strategy and investment priorities identified by each Member State. They present a list of National and Regional Programmes adapted to the needs of the country for implementation of the investments on the ground, including the indicative annual financial allocation for each programme.\n\nThe Partnership Agreement with Ireland is the 22nd to be adopted following those of Greece, Germany, Austria, Czechia, Lithuania, Finland, Denmark, France, Sweden, the Netherlands, Poland, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Portugal, Estonia, Slovakia, Italy, Romania, Croatia, Slovenia and Malta.",
    "Preview: Ireland U21s chase the dream in Israel": "It was honours even after the European Under-21 Championship play-off first leg at Tallaght Stadium on Friday night, but the sense in the aftermath was it's advantage Israel ahead of the return game on Tuesday.\n\nIreland had the chances to establish a good lead in Dublin.\n\nThe impressive Aaron Connolly, Willl Smallbone and Eiran Cashin all went close before Idan Gorno struck for the visitors with a header from a corner. Evan Ferguson soared to glance home a deserved second-half equaliser, but Ireland are facing a massive challenge in Tel Aviv, where temperatures are expected to be around 28 degrees come kick-off time.\n\nIsrael have shown Crawford's team ample respect by calling back three players from the senior squad for the second leg.\n\nCeltic attacker Liel Abada, Olympiacos full-back Doron Leidner and Eden Kartsev of Maccabi Tel Aviv are all available having helped the seniors to a 2-1 UEFA Nations League win over Albania on Saturday.\n\nHowever Crawford will not be doing likewise, despite Gavin Bazunu, Troy Parrott, Nathan Collins, Jason Knight and Michael Obafemi being eligible. They will stick with Stephen Kenny's senior squad for the Aviva Stadium clash against Armenia.\n\nMeanwhile Crawford remains upbeat and quietly confident his charges are good enough to make history and qualify Ireland for a first ever major finals at the U-21 grade.\n\n\"I thought it was a very good performance on Friday,\" he told RT√â Sport.\n\n\"It was disappointing to concede a goal from a set play. It's something we work a lot on, but these things happen. The players showed resilience and character to get themselves back into the game.\n\n\"I do think we can raise our game even more with the players we have. I have no doubt we'll be able to do that.\n\n\"Of course you'd have regrets you missed chances. On another day we could have been a coupe of goals up after the first leg, and I think the real measure of our performance was that they have drafted down three players from the senior team. It's going to be a stiffer challenge, there's not doubt about it, but I think with the quality we have in our squad, we'll be okay.\"\n\n\"I do think we can raise our game even more with the players we have\" - Ireland U21s boss Jim Crawford spoke to @darrenfrehill ahead of Tuesday's massive Euros play-off in Israel, live on the @RTEplayer (6.15pm ko) #RTEsoccer pic.twitter.com/bOyfm2fYF6 ‚Äî RT√â Soccer (@RTEsoccer) September 26, 2022\n\nFerguson is nursing an ankle knock but he's expected to be OK. Bar that, Ireland have a clean bill of health.\n\nHaving really gone at the Israelis in Tallaght, the complexion of the game is likely to be a lot different at Bloomfield Stadium. Certainly Israel will look to take the game to their hosts a lot more, buoyed by the returning trio of Abada, Leidner and Kartsev, plus a partisan crowd that will expect them to play on the front foot.\n\nCrawford also admitted that the heat may dictate the Irish approach.\n\n\"You have to factor that in too, to go after a team for 90 minutes in those type of conditions can be challenging,\" he added.\n\n\"You've got to pick and choose your moments to get after teams. Our boys are clever enough. They'll be well versed on what we've got to do.\"\n\nThere's some seasoned Irish campaigners who have been with the group for a long time now. Among them is Lee O'Connor, the tigerish Tranmere Rovers caps full-back desperate to make the big breakthrough.\n\nO'Connor has been a mainstay of Ireland squads from U-15s up. This is his last campaign in underage international football, and he wants to make it count.\n\n\"I've said it many times, there's nothing like it... it's just a different kind of feeling when you play for Ireland,\" O'Connor said.\n\n\"It's something I've love since my very first game. That's why I've made sure I could come to every sing camp I could go to.\n\n\"It's a big game for all of us but it's 90 minutes of football - and a chance to make history at the end.\n\n\"We're all confident. We know it's going to be a tough game. We know what needs to be done. To be be the first to do it, you'd go down in history.

    "Can Ireland's bumper savings be put to good use?": "Limited spending options and fears of what was to come turned Irish consumers into great savers during pandemic lockdowns.\n\nEven as the economy reopened, the average household was saving far more of their income than before ‚Äì though recent data suggests the rising prices are forcing that to change.\n\nThis means that there is a huge bulk of money sitting in Irish bank accounts at the moment ‚Äì right at a time when households, businesses and politicians search for ways to cover the rising cost of living.\n\nHow much money do people here have saved?\n\nWe need your consent to load this rte-player contentWe use rte-player to manage extra content that can set cookies on your device and collect data about your activity. Please review their details and accept them to load the content.Manage Preferences\n\nA huge amount ‚Äì somewhere in the region of ‚Ç¨146 billion by the end of July, according to the most recent figures from the Central Bank.\n\nTo put that into context, the upcoming budget is estimated to be worth around ‚Ç¨6.5 billion‚Äì and that's a far bigger figure than it would be in a normal year, because of the billions of euro that are planned around the cost of living.\n\nSo the people of Ireland have more than 22 bumper budgets worth of cash sitting in their bank accounts at the moment.\n\nAnd that figure has ballooned significantly in the past two and a half years ‚Äì because people saved an extraordinary amount during the pandemic.\n\nComparing the February 2020 figure with the July 2022 figure, there‚Äôs nearly ‚Ç¨35 billion more in our savings. That‚Äôs the kind of money it would normally take a decade or more to build up.\n\nIt works out at about ‚Ç¨28,600 for every person in the country.\n\nBut I don‚Äôt have anything like that in my bank account‚Ä¶\n\nUnfortunately, all of that money isn‚Äôt very evenly distributed.\n\nAnd, unsurprisingly, it‚Äôs the country‚Äôs higher earners that tend to hold the bulk of the money saved.\n\nIt should be said that most people in the country do have some level of savings ‚Äì recent figures from the Central Statistics Office says that nearly 97% of households have some form of savings.\n\nBut the amount in those savings accounts tends to decline in line with the amount of disposable income a person has.\n\nThere are also links between the likelihood of having savings and your level of education, and whether someone is living in their own house or whether they‚Äôre renting.\n\nAnd that inequality in savings was only enhanced by the pandemic.\n\nIf you were to take two types of workers ‚Äì let‚Äôs say, a high-earning tech worker, and regular retail worker.\n\nThere‚Äôs already a huge difference in their earnings here ‚Äì but when the pandemic hit, the tech worker was able to continue doing their job from home, pretty much with no interruption.\n\nThat means their earnings stayed the same, in some cases they actually increased, and because they couldn‚Äôt go anywhere, suddenly all of their socialising money started building up in their bank account.\n\nThe retail worker also wouldn‚Äôt have had much available to spend their money on, but because they were forced to stop working altogether, and put onto the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, they didn‚Äôt have much in the way of disposable income left once their bills were taken care of.\n\nAre we still saving our money?\n\nAs the economy began to reopen, there was lots of discussion about what might happen with all of the savings built up during the height of the pandemic.\n\nThere were some ‚Äì particularly retailers ‚Äì who hoped that there might be some kind of post-lockdown spending spree.\n\nConsumer spending did rise ‚Äì and some people seemed to put their savings towards some big ticket items, like a trip abroad. Some of the rapid rise in house prices has also been attributed to people directing their savings towards a deposit on a new home.\n\nBut while spending has been higher than before, it‚Äôs definitely not been the splurge that some had expected.\n\nIn fact, so far it seems as though people have continued their savings habit even as life returned to normal.\n\nThe most recent Household Savings stats from the CSO shows that people were still putting away almost 20% of their income in the middle of the year.\n\nThat‚Äôs about double the pre-pandemic average.\n\nPerhaps people realised that they were able to save more than they previously thought possible ‚Äì or perhaps it shows that households are remaining cautious, particularly given the context of the war in Ukraine and talk of a recession in the Euro Zone.\n\nIt should be said, though, that these CSO figures only bring us to June ‚Äì before the cost of living crisis really started to bite.\n\nA more recent survey from the Bank of Ireland shows that people are now saving less than they feel they should, because they simply can‚Äôt afford to.\n\nSo if we‚Äôre not spending it, what options do savers have to get the most out of their money?\n\nWell, if they‚Äôre looking to save it ‚Äì there‚Äôs not a lot on offer at the moment.\n\nAcross the board, savings accounts are offering next to nothing in terms of interest ‚Äì and that‚Äôs been the case ever since the European Central Bank dropped its interest rates to zero.\n\nECB interest rates are on the rise but so far the main Irish banks ‚Äì outside of tracker mortgages - haven‚Äôt yet passed those on.\n\nThat‚Äôs good news for those on a variable mortgage, or someone with a personal loan, but it‚Äôs bad news for savers, because it means they‚Äôre not yet benefitting from the interest rate.\n\nFor those looking for a return on their money, investments are of course an option ‚Äì but only if you have a lump sum of money that you‚Äôre happy to put out of reach for a couple of years.\n\nAnd, unlike savings, there‚Äôs no guarantee with investments ‚Äì so you could end up losing money, or not making an awful lot.\n\nGenerally it‚Äôs about balancing risk and reward with this kind of thing ‚Äì if you want the best chance of making a great return, you need to make riskier investments.\n\nIf you want to be sure you don‚Äôt lose money, you‚Äôre going to have to go with something that promises fairly modest returns.\n\nTake, for example, a 10 Year National Solidarity Bond‚Äì which is 100% guaranteed by the State.\n\nIf you put ‚Ç¨1,000 into that today, in 10 years time you‚Äôll get back ‚Ç¨1,100.\n\nAnd with the current rate of inflation‚Ä¶\n\nThe is the problem facing all people saving at the moment ‚Äì they‚Äôre getting little or nothing for their money, and the value of that money is being whittled away by the month.\n\nFor example, if you put that ‚Ç¨1,000 into your savings at the start of the pandemic, in terms of buying power, it‚Äôs now effectively worth less than ‚Ç¨890 because of inflation.\n\nThe rate of inflation is expected to tail off over the next year or two ‚Äì but it‚Äôs still going to be higher than desired, which means your money is slowly losing value while it‚Äôs earning you nothing.\n\nSo what other options do savers have?\n\nWell, they could spend the money ‚Äì though due to inflation there‚Äôs not much value to be had, especially if they were thinking of doing something like a home renovation or upgrade.\n\nPeople may also be unwilling to let go of their savings at the moment, for fear that they need it to fall back on if their household budgets get squeezed even further, or if there‚Äôs another economic downturn that threatens their income.\n\nAnd the general personal finance advice is to keep a certain amount of cash to hand at all times ‚Äì just in case your income suddenly stops, or the washing machine breaks down.\n\nSo using up all of your savings isn‚Äôt a good idea either way.\n\nBut assuming you have money beyond that recommended buffer, paying off debt is probably a good use of money at the moment, especially if it‚Äôs high interest lending like on a credit card.\n\nThe most recent Central Bank statistics tell us that household debt stood at ‚Ç¨128 billion late last year ‚Äì so not too far behind what we have saved.\n\nIf people have the money to clear some of that, it might mean reducing or even wiping out a loan repayment altogether, which will bolster their monthly budget as they head into the winter.\n\nIn fact, even if you‚Äôre just paying off a part of a loan ‚Äì like your mortgage ‚Äì it will ultimately stand to you.\n\nAnother option is to put money towards a pension.\n\nFor many this is about as long-term of an investment as you can make, but we do know that a lack of pensions provision is a major issue in Ireland, and it takes a long time for people to build up the kind of pension pot that they would like to have a comfortable retirement.\n\nIs there any way for the Government to tap into those savings?\n\nWell it kind of does already ‚Äì for example, any interest earned is liable to Deposit Interest Retention Tax ‚Äì or DIRT ‚Äì at 33%.\n\nThough, given that people haven‚Äôt been earning much on their savings for the past few years, there isn‚Äôt really much money to be made from that tax at the moment.\n\nThe State Savings scheme, including things like the National Solidarity Bond and Prize Bonds are effective an attempt by Government to benefit from people‚Äôs savings, too.\n\nThat‚Äôs because they‚Äôre effectively a way for the State to borrow citizens‚Äô money for an extended period of time, which they can then use for various investments and public services.\n\nBeyond that, though, the Government is actually in a bit of a bind when it comes to people‚Äôs savings.\n\nNormally if you were looking at businesses around the country struggling on the one hand, and billions and billions sitting in savings accounts on the other, it would make sense to try to come up with a scheme to try to unleash that cash in order to help businesses out.\n\nThink of some kind of reverse SSIA scheme that incentivises spending rather than saving.\n\nBut, if you were to do that, you run the risk of simply adding to the inflation problem at the moment ‚Äì which would only prolong the pain that consumers and companies are facing right now.\n\nSo, as counter-intuitive as it seems, the Government probably doesn‚Äôt want too much money coming into the economy right now.\n\nIn fact, that‚Äôs partly why a central bank raises interest rates when it wants to cool economic activity. Because higher interest rates on your savings account ‚Äì in theory at least ‚Äì encourages you to save rather than spend.",

    "Ireland need Jeff Hendrick's influence off the bench in certain scenarios": "Irish Journalist Dan McDonnell joined Joe Molloy on The Football Show to discuss Ireland's midfield.\n\nIreland suffered a disappointing loss to Scotland in Hampden Park.\n\nIt was disappointing because they played well and still lost. Alan Browne's handball was silly. It gave Scotland the game-winning penalty, and there were plenty of other missed opportunities too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, Ireland played well for the most part. The back three of John Egan, Nathan Collins and Dara O'Shea excelled together. Michael Obafemi and Troy Parrott continue to develop their relationship. Matt Doherty returned in a decent display and the midfield trio battled hard for 90 minutes.\n\nBut there was a lack of control in Ireland's performance. Scotland showed their experience during the second half and Joe Molloy couldn't help but notice Ireland lacked that same quality.\n\n\"There were definitely periods in the second half when Scotland had control of the game,\" Molloy said.\n\n\"We almost did that too readily and you would love if that midfield three had almost said...'We might just try to take the sting out of this game a touch.' Now I don't know if that's experience or nous or maybe they were under strict instructions to get it forward, that's the way we hurt them.\n\n\"But that was definitely a feeling watching the game.\"\n\nDan McDonnell agreed with Molloy.\n\nNone of Cullen, Knight nor Molumby controlled possession or dictated the play. They weren't bad on the ball, but they didn't understand how or have the ability to slow the game down when Ireland needed them to.\n\nMcDonnell explains it's an area that Ireland are concerned about.\n\n\"To a degree this comes back to quality of player in this department,\" McDonnell said.\n\n\"There's no doubt that where Ireland lack depth at the minute is in those midfield positions...That midfield, Knight and Molumby, probably more so picked for their off the ball work rate than their on the ball abilities. Although Molumby I think has improved on the ball...and Knight is a very good player, but he's someone who makes breaks and latches onto attacks.\n\n\"You don't necessarily have [someone like] Callum McGregor who controls things a small bit more.\"\n\nWill Smallbone and Gavin Kilkenny are potential call-ups for the November internationals. The under-21 team doesn't have fixtures during that window. Smallbone is particularly exciting, but Kilkenny is closer to the quarterback-style passer who will sit deep and slow the game down when Ireland need him to.\n\nBut neither player is an option for Tuesday night and neither player is even guaranteed to make the next squad.\n\nInstead, Ireland can look at their current bench. Jeff Hendrick has more experience than any other Ireland midfielder. He played well for Kenny previously and McDonnell reckons he could have made a difference for Ireland on Saturday.\n\n\"He's an unpopular player with sections of the fanbase...something different would have been bringing in Jeff Hendrick. On a good day, and there have been good days under Kenny. [He's] a good passer and he has a bit of a presence.\n\n\"With his experience he could have taken a bit of the sting out of it. It was a bit frantic, the game in general.\"\n\nMatt Doherty is expecting big things.\n\nFootball on Off The Ball brought to you by Sky.

    "Royal London Becomes Ireland's First Pension Provider in a Decade": "Royal London Ireland has become the first new pension provider in Ireland for over a decade, and the first life assurance company provider to enter the Irish pensions market for more than 30 years.\n\nThe British life and pensions provider has announced the development of new pensions produdts that will be offered exclusively through financial brokers.\n\nThe company will initially offer a personal retirement bond (PRB) and an approved retirement fund (ARF) without policy fees or fund switching charges, plus automatic portfolio rebalance and ValueShare, a payment that will be added to customer fund returns in years that the company does well.\n\nNoel Freeley, CEO of Royal London Ireland, commented: \"Following several years of behind-the-scenes work, intense consultation with financial brokers and a multi-million capital investment, we have been able to create a compelling pension proposition that will deliver value for money and competitive pricing for customers, combined with access to two leading asset managers Royal London Asset Management (RLAM) and BlackRock.\n\n\"Underpinned by strong customer service, our pension products will provide positive competition in terms of innovation, pricing and transparency, with no fixed or monetary policy fees or fund switching charges.\n\n\"This expansion represents the next stage of development in our ongoing growth in Ireland. We‚Äôre in a position where we‚Äôre market leader in broker protection products and where we have increased our broker protection estimated market share from 22.5% to 30.2% since 2020, so we have a strong distribution platform to build from.\"\n\nNoel Feeley said Royal London's entry was the result of several years of work and investment.\n\n‚ÄúThe competition in Ireland‚Äôs pensions market has been largely unchanged for some time. New entrants are rare, primarily due to the level of investment required to deliver a high-value product and the expertise demanded to build a robust service support platform.\n\nIn the UK, Royal London is the largest mutual life and pensions provider, with responsibility for more than 21,000 workplace pensions schemes and 1.6m members.\n\nAssets under management by Royal London Asset Management total ‚Ç¨174bn, including funds managed on behalf of third parties.

    "Ireland joins EU hawks on Russia, as outrage spreads": "Ireland has joined Poland and the Baltic states in lobbying for more hawkish Russia sanctions, in a sign of widening moral outrage in Europe.\n\nThe Irish added their \"IE\" stamp to a 9-page long list of proposals, including bank and diamond industry bans, circulated in Brussels and seen by EUobserver on Friday (23 September).\n\nStudent or retired? Then this plan is for you.\n\nNo more smartphone sales to Russia, the group added (Photo: Wikimedia)\n\nThe Irish taoiseach, Miche√°l Martin, also condemned Russia's actions in strident terms at the UN General Assembly in New York on Thursday.\n\n\"Russia [is] behaving as a rogue state,\" he said, referring to its plan to annex parts of eastern Ukraine.\n\nIreland is neutral in military terms, located at the opposite end of Europe from the war, and has a liberal government.\n\nPoland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are Nato hawks with Russian borders who fear Russian aggression and who have more conservative ruling parties.\n\nThe Irish foreign ministry declined to comment on the novel EU grouping.\n\nOne EU diplomat described it as a \"big deal\", which showed how the conflict was reshaping European politics. A second EU diplomat speculated that the US, which has close ties with Ireland, might have urged Dublin to side with Warsaw against more dovish EU capitals.\n\n\"We hope even more will join the group,\" a Polish diplomat said.\n\nBut a fourth EU diplomat said it wasn't so surprising, given Ireland's record of \"maximalist\" positions on human-rights issues.\n\nThe Irish-backed proposals say Russian lenders Gazprombank, Alfa Bank, Rosbank, and Tinkoff Bank should be cut off from the 'Swift' international payments grid.\n\nA Gazprombank ban would have far-reaching consequences because it handles payments for Russian gas exports.\n\n\"It shall be prohibited to purchase, import, or transfer, directly or indirectly, diamonds ... if they originate in Russia and if they have been exported from Russia into the [European] Union or to any third country,\" the group also proposed to add to the EU's sanctions regime. Russian diamond exports are worth ‚Ç¨4bn a year.\n\nThey called for a \"ban on cooperating with Russia on nuclear energy\", on the transfer of EU or US cash banknotes to Russia, and on sales of real estate to Russians.\n\nIn the services sector, the EU should impose a \"ban on using Kaspersky Lab [a Russian cybersecurity giant] technology\" inside Europe and stop EU firms from doing IT work for Russian clients, the group said.\n\nOn the counter-propaganda front, they proposed taking three Russian TV broadcasters (NTV Mir, REN TV, and Rossija 1), as well as six online ones (NewsFront, SouthFront, Katehon, Strategic Culture Foundation, Fondsk, and InfoRos), off the airwaves.\n\nThey also wanted an explicit ban on Russian funding for EU-registered lobbying firms, NGOs, and think-thanks.\n\nThey said people who help Russia to circumvent sanctions should themselves be put on EU visa-ban and asset-freeze blacklists.\n\nAnd they listed dozens of high-tech products that should no longer be exported to the EU's war-mongering neighbour, including smartphones, radar equipment, and laser appliances.\n\nArt of the possible\n\nThe proposals come as Russia-occupied regions in eastern Ukraine begin fake referendums on independence, leading to Russian annexation as early as next week.\n\nAll 27 EU countries are to hold talks with the EU Commission over the weekend on the feasibility of sanctions ideas.\n\n\"The Commission has carried out consultations with national capitals, so it's in the best position to know what would be acceptable to everyone,\" another EU diplomat said.\n\nThe minimum the EU will do is blacklist officials involved in the bogus referendums, list a few minor Russian banks, and ban some high-tech products, diplomats predicted.\n\nThey will also try to stop firms shipping Russian oil sold at inflated prices, for instance by invalidating insurance coverage for tankers involved in the trade.\n\nThe eighth round of sanctions comes after the EU already listed 1,206 Russians and struck out at most sectors of the Russian economy, leaving few big targets left.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Poland and the Baltic States make headway with Irish support.\n\nRussia-friendly Hungary has in the past vetoed blacklistings and is up to its neck in nuclear cooperation with Russian firm Rosatom, which is building two reactors at Hungary's Paks atomic plant.\n\nFrance, Germany, and Italy, as well as smaller countries, such as Austria, Cyprus, and Greece, are also more dovish than Poland and the Baltic states.\n\nAnd some EU sources saw the Irish-Polish-Baltic paper as more of a roadmap for action further down the line, than as a list of demands to be implemented in reaction to the annexations.\n\n\"It's more of a reflection paper, showing the direction of travel,\" an EU contact said.",

    "Financial support package announced for GPs in Northern Ireland": "A ¬£5.5m package of support measures has been announced to help ease the pressures facing general practice in Northern Ireland.\n\nHealth Minister Robin Swann said ¬£1m of the funding would go to a new Attract, Recruit, Retain scheme to help attract GPs in hard-to-recruit areas.\n\nThere is also ¬£680,000 to boost the support team for GP practices who are experiencing difficulties, he said.\n\nAnd it includes ¬£3m to support practices across Northern Ireland through the winter to resource additional in-hours and out of hours sessions.\n\nMr Swann also committed to progressing work to address the ongoing issue of GP indemnity, where Northern Ireland has differed from the rest of the UK on agreeing a state-backed system, with a full plan expected in November.\n\n‚ÄòThe pressures in primary care services are caused in large part by historic underinvestment over a number of years which has left the system struggling to meet ever-growing demand,‚Äô he said.\n\n‚ÄòMy department is taking action to address the root causes of these issues in service.\n\n‚ÄòThis includes increasing the number of GP training places in Northern Ireland to an all-time high of 121 and providing an additional ¬£1.5m investment to support continued staff recruitment to the MDT model.‚Äô\n\nBut he added the package announced today would help strengthen GP services through the winter period and provide targeted help to those practices that are most at risk.\n\nCommenting on the additional funding for general practice, BMA NI GP committee chair Dr Alan Stout said the announcement was welcome and it was clear the minister understood the problems general practice was facing.\n\nBut he added that ‚Äòunfortunately it will not be a solution to the problems many practices are experiencing right now‚Äô.\n\n‚ÄòThe Attract, Recruit, Retain scheme may help practices recruit new GPs but with a well-documented ageing workforce, and with a quarter of our GPs over the age of 55, we need to ensure that we retain GPs as well in order to stabilise and grow general practice.\n\n‚ÄòMDTs have helped many practices and patients but we really need to see it rolled out right across Northern Ireland so there is parity for all patients.‚Äô\n\nHe added they had raised issues with indemnity with the minister and Department of Health many times and it is good to see that recognised.\n\n‚ÄòFinally, meaningful change will require proper planning and this will require not only a budget for this year, but also a multiyear budget. This requires an executive and strong political leadership. We will continue to see deterioration of our NHS until this happens.‚Äô",

    "Ireland ambassador to UK urges negotiations to solve Brexit issues": "(Alliance News) - Ireland's ambassador to the UK has stressed the need to find a negotiated solution to the problems surrounding Northern Ireland's post-Brexit arrangements.\n\nMartin Fraser said he was an optimist about the chances of resolving the issues around the Northern Ireland protocol but the situation was currently in the \"words phase\" and had to move to the \"actions phase\".\n\nThe UK government is legislating to effectively tear up parts of the agreement, which sets out how goods flowing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland are treated.\n\nFraser, speaking at a fringe event at the Labour Party conference in Liverpool, said the protocol was the only way to resolve the problems caused by Brexit.\n\nThe agreement, signed by then prime minister Boris Johnson's government, effectively keeps Northern Ireland aligned with many EU single market rules to avoid a hard border with Ireland, therefore requiring some checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea.\n\nDevolution in the region has been in flux since February when the DUP withdrew its first minister from the governing executive in protest at the economic border created in the Irish Sea by the protocol.\n\nFraser acknowledged there were \"legitimate concerns\" but said: \"How do we solve it? We solve it by negotiating through the issues that are there.\n\n\"From our point of view, from the EU, we solve it by implementing the protocol that was agreed with the British government, which the British government signed and fought an election, passed through Parliament.\n\n\"We think it's the best and only solution. But of course we recognise that people have legitimate issues and we do definitely recognise that the Unionist community in Northern Ireland has legitimate concerns which we have to try and address.\n\n\"But we address them by negotiating.\"\n\nAsked if he was optimistic about the situation, he said: \"I think we have to solve this problem, I think we can, I think we should.\"\n\nHe added: \"I couldn't have worked on Northern Ireland politics for the best part of 20 years without being optimistic and I think we should all be optimistic.\"\n\nsource: PA\n\nCopyright 2022 Alliance News Limited.

    "Ben Collins ‚Äì Unionists are already having conversations about a united Ireland": "Ben Collins's new book Irish Unity ‚Äì Time to Prepare\n\nFor me the Good Friday Agreement was an amazing achievement. It brought to an end the Troubles and secured the peace, however imperfect, which we now enjoy. On a personal level it also enabled me to think about my own sense of identity and how I wanted to see Northern Ireland develop. It allowed me to think about a united Ireland and whether I wanted there to be one, in a way which had not been possible before. Until that point I was determined that I was not going to be forced into a united Ireland through violence or the threats of violence.\n\nI had been a student in Dundee while the Good Friday Agreement was negotiated and returned to Belfast just after the referendum had passed. There was a sense of hope that Northern Ireland could become an economic powerhouse. We are still waiting for that to happen. After the Northern Ireland Assembly collapsed in 2001 I returned to Scotland. I had joined the Conservatives just before I moved because I believed in enterprise and was keen to get involved with bread and butter politics. While I had hoped and expected that Ken Clarke would become leader and take the party in a more liberal and pro-European direction, the opposite happened. I was alarmed at their increasing hostility towards Europe. At the same time I heard the SNP talk about fiscal autonomy which really appealed to me. I left the Conservative party after two years.\n\nBeing away from Northern Ireland I was able to embrace my growing sense of Irishness and desire for Irish unity. The beauty of the Good Friday Agreement was that you could be Irish, British, European or all three. Borders were increasingly irrelevant until the EU referendum. While I realised that the vote would be a lot closer than people originally thought, I was genuinely shocked when the UK, or more specifically England and Wales voted for Brexit.\n\nWhile Irish unity had been a long term aspiration of mine, it became an urgent necessity for me after the vote for Brexit. The six years since the vote have been distressing and unsettling in many ways. Members of my own immediate family and close friends voted for Brexit. I do not think that anyone is happy with how it has turned out. My sense of Britishness had dissipated over time and seeing elderly men in Sunderland celebrating the vote to leave the European Union struck me as such an alien idea.\n\nThe idea to write a book on Irish unity came to me in July 2012 just before the London Olympics. I could tell that politics across the UK was changing when the Scottish referendum was called. The UK government intended to win by a clear two to one margin to put the issue to rest for a generation, but the final vote was much closer. It was only after the Brexit vote that I decided to focus seriously on setting out my thoughts on how we could achieve a New Ireland.\n\nI know that Irish unity has been an aspirational ideal for many people for a long time. But when you consider the damage which is being done to the island of Ireland by Brexit, there is now a hard-headed rationale for planning and preparing now.\n\nLike several thousand other people I will be travelling to Dublin on Saturday to attend the Ireland‚Äôs Future event ‚ÄòTogether We Can‚Äô in the 3Arena and I look forward to speaking at it. While political unionism rarely engages in the debate on Irish unity, I know from personal experience that people from unionist backgrounds are already taking part in this conversation. It may not often be happening out in the open, but these discussions are taking place. Often these private chats will cover the same points, Brexit is a disaster, Westminster is dysfunctional and political unionism is completely out of touch. People are open to a different future but they want to know what this will involve and what will it mean for them and their families. In a very small way I hope to add to this conversation with my book ‚ÄòIrish Unity: Time to Prepare‚Äô and play my part in helping us to plan and prepare in advance of the border poll which I think is likely at some point over the next decade. I believe that we can win that vote and it will be a success if we have a plan in place beforehand.\n\n:: 'Irish Unity: Time to Prepare' by Ben Collins is published by Luath Press and will be launched at Belfast's Linen Hall Library on Thursday October 6.",

    "From Queen Elizabeth to King Charles: how Northern Ireland‚Äôs unionists feel about the monarchy": "Monarchism is embedded in Northern Ireland‚Äôs Ulster unionist identity. There is probably no such thing as a ‚Äúrepublican unionist‚Äù. Many unionists descend from Protestant settlers from Britain who colonised Ireland four centuries ago. Loyalty to the monarch was an essential qualification for those making the journey, and the basis of that loyalty was the Protestantism of the crown, which provided a bulwark against the Catholicism of the Irish and much of Europe.\n\nAs Britain‚Äôs global reach grew, Protestants in Ireland shared in what was believed to be the God-ordained prosperity and power of the empire. As Irish nationalism grew in the late 19th century, Protestants clung to the union with Britain to avoid absorption into what they feared would be a hostile all-Ireland state.\n\nTo this day, unlike the many people around the world who see the British monarchy as a symbol of oppression, unionists view it as the embodiment of their political and religious liberty.\n\nAfter the partition of Ireland in 1921, as James Loughlin writes in his history of the British crown in Ireland, ‚Äúcontinued Unionist anxieties about constitutional security put a primacy on an enhanced identity with the monarchy‚Äù. Royal visits were used by the unionist government to legitimise their regime and affirm, for people at home and in Britain, their rightful place in the UK.\n\nIn Queen Elizabeth, unionists found a strong supporter. At her coronation in 1952, apparently at her wishes, war-time generals, aristocrats and politicians from Ulster held prominent ceremonial functions. Royal honours were bestowed on Northern Ireland subjects. Two swans were donated to Portadown.\n\nAlamy/Reuters\n\nBut as Loughlin argues, royal endorsement merely stoked unionists‚Äô complacency about their unjust practice of government. That practice was unsustainable and ultimately disintegrated amid the violence of the Troubles which began at the end of the 1960s.\n\nIn that conflict, unionist or ‚Äúloyalist‚Äù paramilitaries were imprisoned in droves by the very state for which they were fighting. Their fidelity to the Queen but not her government led to them being described, in the title of a classic 1977 book on Ulster loyalism, as Queen‚Äôs Rebels. ‚ÄúTheir only crime was loyalty,‚Äù went a loyalist slogan.\n\nAfter the Troubles\n\nIn the peace process era, royal paraphernalia was inevitably drawn into Northern Ireland‚Äôs cultural battles. Unionists believed that republicans and nationalists wanted to eliminate all monarchical trappings, as had happened in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe proposal made in 1999 by the Patten Commission on police reform to remove the title ‚ÄúRoyal Ulster Constabulary‚Äù from the police and the crown symbol from the police badge met with universal unionist anger. Nationalists countered that the equality mandated by the 1998 Good Friday Agreement meant that British cultural ascendancy had to end.\n\nToday, few unionists would point to the Protestantism of the monarchy as the foundation of their political allegiance. That said, Queen Elizabeth‚Äôs Christian faith, expressed especially in her Christmas speeches, enhanced her personal appeal within the unionist community where there remains an affinity with Protestant evangelicalism and a respect for public piety.\n\nWhile the Queen‚Äôs death has been deeply felt in unionist areas, Northern Ireland‚Äôs royalists and loyalists will be reassured by King Charles‚Äôs promises of continuity with his mother‚Äôs approach to the role. The Queen will remain in the unionist imagination, along with other figures from the past, as an exemplar and beacon of their Britishness.\n\nBut rather than being an unyielding symbol of continuity, the monarchy will reflect changing political circumstances. King Charles is at ease in the Republic of Ireland and appears unperturbed by the rise of Sinn F√©in in the North (he actually seemed to congratulate Sinn F√©in on becoming the largest party when he visited Northern Ireland in the days following the Queen‚Äôs death).\n\nAlamy\n\nWhile footage of the Queen‚Äôs historic 2011 visit to Ireland has been replayed again and again, a less remembered but just as potent episode was the visit of the then-Prince Charles to Mullaghmore in County Sligo in 2015. He attended a service of reconciliation, shook hands with Irish republican leader Gerry Adams, and went to the location where his great uncle Lord Mountbatten, with whom he was close, was killed by the IRA in 1979. His visits to the Republic have become routine.\n\nMeanwhile, unionists are reluctant to recognise the Irish identity of nationalists in Northern Ireland and to act as deputy to a Sinn F√©in first minister since republicans‚Äô success in May‚Äôs Assembly election. Their attitudes towards the Irish government have hardened since Brexit.\n\nIn a future referendum on Irish unity, unionists must maximise the electorate‚Äôs identification with the UK. This suggests that emulating the generosity towards traditional enemies shown by their revered late queen and her successor would be unionists‚Äô most effective political strategy.",
    "Queen Elizabeth remembered in Ireland for historic reconciliation": "Expressions of sympathy in Ireland demonstrate how Queen Elizabeth II achieved healing in the fraught history of Ireland and Britain.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II reigned for more than 70 years and for 30 years during that time a vicious conflict was fought in the part of her United Kingdom known as Northern Ireland.\n\nAbout 3,600 people were killed and more than 30,000 wounded from 1969 until the signing of an agreement in 1998, which largely brought peace between those fighting against British rule in the northern province of Ireland, and those battling to preserve and defend the union with Britain.\n\nThe fighting, euphemistically known as ‚Äúthe Troubles‚Äù, was brutal, bitter, and sectarian.\n\nBritish troops, the Northern Irish security services, Irish Republican Army (IRA) fighters, and pro-British Loyalist armed groups bombed and shot, killed and maimed, as they turned city streets and rural towns into guerrilla-war battlefields.\n\nFor generations of Irish nationalists and republicans, the British Crown and its forces were an enemy responsible for the degradation of centuries of colonial rule in Ireland.\n\nYet, on Thursday, two Irish soldiers lowered Ireland‚Äôs tricolour flag to half-staff at a government building in Dublin to mark the queen‚Äôs death. Irish embassies around the world also followed suit and lowered the republic‚Äôs flag as a mark of respect.\n\nThe Irish flag has been lowered to half mast at Government Buildings this evening to mark the death of HM Queen Elizabeth.

I salute her contribution to this transformation ‚Äî Mary Lou McDonald (@MaryLouMcDonald) September 8, 2022\n\nThe expression of sympathy in Ireland from all quarters demonstrates how Queen Elizabeth achieved something remarkable in the fraught history of the two countries.\n\nAnd it began with a visit.\n\nSymbols and reconciliation\n\nIn 2011, Elizabeth became the first British monarch to visit the Republic of Ireland since the country fought and gained independence from London almost a century earlier.\n\nDuring her four-day trip, the queen wore green ‚Äì the symbolism not lost in a country referred to as the ‚Äúemerald isle‚Äù.\n\nShe laid a wreath at a monument dedicated to those who had fought and died for Irish independence from Britain.\n\nShe stepped onto the pitch at Dublin‚Äôs Croke Park stadium, the home of traditional Irish sport and the scene of a mass killing of 14 people by British forces almost 100 years earlier.\n\nThen at a dinner in Dublin Castle, the former nerve centre of British rule in Ireland, the queen spoke some words in the Irish language.\n\nThe queen‚Äôs use of Gaelic, once banned under British rule, to begin her speech drew an audible gasp of surprise and a spontaneous round of applause from guests in attendance.\n\nMin @EamonRyan described as \"pivotal\" the moment Queen Elizabeth spoke Irish at the State dinner in Dublin Castle in 2011 pic.twitter.com/zQa0T6yWbK ‚Äî Morning Ireland (@morningireland) September 9, 2022\n\nThe queen‚Äôs visit ‚Äì during which she expressed regret for centuries of conflict between the two countries ‚Äì was a powerful gesture of reconciliation for Britain‚Äôs bloody past in Ireland.\n\nHer description of the two countries as ‚Äúfirm friends and equal partners‚Äù, and her many other gestures, had the power to reset relations with Britain for more than one generation in Ireland.\n\n‚ÄúDuring those memorable few days eleven years ago, the queen did not shy away from the shadows of the past,‚Äù President Higgins wrote in his message of condolence.\n\n‚ÄúHer moving words and gestures of respect were deeply appreciated and admired by the people of Ireland.‚Äù\n\nHealing history\n\nA year after her visit to Ireland, the queen met and shook the hand of former IRA commander and then-Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, the late Martin McGuinness, in Belfast.\n\nThat handshake was historic.\n\nThe IRA had killed the queen‚Äôs cousin Lord Louis Mountbatten ‚Äì the last viceroy of India ‚Äì in 1979 when they blew up his fishing boat in Donegal Bay, in the republic‚Äôs northwest. Three other relatives of Mountbatten died in the attack.\n\nThirty years of bloodshed between Irish nationalists, pro-British loyalists, and the British military in British-run Northern Ireland was largely ended by the 1998 peace deal that was brokered by Irish and British leaders.\n\nBut it was the queen‚Äôs visit 13 years after the signing of the peace agreement that provided a degree of personal, historic healing.\n\nWriting in Britain‚Äôs Guardian newspaper shortly after the Queen‚Äôs visit, Irish columnist Fintan O‚ÄôToole summed up a feeling likely experienced by many Irish people.\n\n‚ÄúThere are, presumably, two rules the Queen has absorbed so deeply that they have become instinctive: don‚Äôt take risks; don‚Äôt stir emotions,‚Äù O‚ÄôToole wrote.\n\n‚ÄúShe broke both rules in Ireland last week,‚Äù he wrote.\n\n‚ÄúTo the great surprise of those of us who have little time for monarchy, she walked that line with amazing grace. It is not simply that she didn‚Äôt put a foot wrong. It is that every step seemed exactly right.‚Äù",

Within the Euro Area (EA), Ireland comprises a relatively small proportion of aggregate GDP (3.4 percent), of which a significant portion is attributable to foreign-owned multinational enterprises (MNEs). Yet, the Irish financial system holds assets of EUR 7.9 trillion, over 18 times GDP. Since monetary policy is carried out by the European Central Bank (ECB) for the entire EA, macroprudential policy has the potential to play a critical stabilizing role for the Irish financial system.",
