    "Norway cancels Coast Guard visit to Murmansk": "It was Lt. Gen. Stanislav Maslov, the powerful chief of FSB’s Border Guard Directorate, that in April, seven weeks after Russia’s onslaught on Ukraine, announced the planned port call by a Norwegian Coast Guard vessel to the Arctic port of Murmansk.\n\nThe news made media headlines in northern Russia at a time when the country’s uniformed services were frozen out of most joint events with European neighbors.\n\nIt was, according to FSB, at a meeting between Lt. Gen. Maslov and the chief of the Norwegian Joint Headquarters, Lt. Gen. Yngve Odlo, the Coast Guard visit to Murmansk later in the year was agreed.\n\nThe meeting took place at Borisoglebsk, just across the Norwegian-Russian border in the north.\n\n“In light of the current situation, we don’t find it natural that such a visit by a vessel should take place,” says spokesperson with the Joint Headquarters, Thomas Gjesdal to the Barents Observer.\n\nGjesdal underlines that a physical meeting between Odlo and his Russian counterpart will take place.\n\nThe commanders in charge of the land and sea border between the two countries in the north meet annually. One year in Russia, the next in Norway. In Russia, it is the FSB that is in charge of controlling the land border and the maritime border in the Barents Sea.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLast fall, the FSB Commander and other officers made port call to the border town Kirkenes with the Coast Guard ship “Polyarnaya Zvezda”.\n\nThe two coast guard vessels “KV Nordkapp” and “Polyarnaya Zvezda” made port call to Kirkenes in September 2021.

Search- and Rescue (SAR), and questions related to the two countries’ joint land border are topics of mutual importance.\n\nThe commander at the NJHQ near Bodø and the commander of Russia’s Northern Fleet in Severomorsk keep open a Skype-video link for exchange of information, an option considered important to avoid misunderstandings in northern areas where both Norwegian and Russian military forces operate and exercise.\n\nIn December 2021, Norway and Russia signed an updated version of the bilateral Incidents at Sea agreement, aimed to avoid actions that could trigger dangerous situations, accidents, or military misunderstandings. First signed in 1990, the amended agreement now includes drones, a ban on dangerous use of lasers and other technology updates.",

    "Norway calls for vigilance over unidentified drones near oil and gas fields": "The Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority (PSA) has urged oil companies and vessel owners to be more vigilant following a series of reports of unidentified drones flying close to oil and gas installations offshore Norway — including facilities considered strategically important to European gas supplies.\n\nThe oil safety regulator said on Monday that unidentified drones and/or aircraft could pose a serious risk to oil and gas platforms, and helicopter traffic in the area, with the possibility of collisions or even “deliberate attacks”.\n\nThe PSA said that all platforms on the Norwegian continental shelf are surrounded by a safety zone that “normally extends 500 metres from the facility, and from the seabed to 500 metres above the highest point on the facility”.\n\n“Infringing a safety zone may be punishable by law. The police will consider whether to launch an investigation,” it added.\n\nA PSA spokesperson declined to comment on the possible origin of the drones and whether they are controlled by “locals” or “foreign” interests and added: “I don't want to speculate on who is behind it. This is part of the police investigation.”\n\nNorway’s police have already launched an investigation following unidentified drone sightings near oil and gas installations operated by Norwegian state-controlled energy company Equinor, according to local media.\n\nArticle continues below the advert\n\nCritical to European increased gas supply\n\nLocal news outlet Stavanger Aftenblad reported that one of the recent, unidentified drone spottings occured near the Gina Krog field, 30 kilometres northwest of the Sleipner field and 230 kilometres southwest of Stavanger.\n\nGina Krog was one of the offshore fields granted permission by the Norwegian government in July to increase production to help Norway respond to heightened demand for energy in Western Europe following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February.\n\nNeither Equinor nor the Norwegian Police have responded to Upstream’s requests for comment by the time of publishing.",

    "New Polish gas pipeline from Norway to reach full capacity ahead of schedule": "Poland’s new pipeline bringing Norwegian gas via Denmark and through the Baltic Sea – which is due to open this week – will be able to transport up to twice as much gas as previously planned this year due to the faster-than-expected progress of work.\n\nThe Baltic Pipe, which is seen as a key element in Poland’s diversification away from Russian energy sources, is due to begin transporting gas this Saturday, 1 October, with an initial capacity equivalent to 2-3 billion cubic metres (bmc) per year.\n\nIt was then expected to reach its full capacity of 10 bcm of gas per year at the start of 2023. However, on Saturday Danish gas system operator Energinet announced that work “is progressing so well” that full capacity is due to be reached by the end of November this year.\n\n“We are pleased to announce that a major part of the vast project has [already] been completed and is ready for use,” said Torben Brabo, Energinet’s director of international relations.\n\n“Due to an extraordinary effort on the part of everyone involved, we were able to lay the remaining pipelines faster than expected,” he added. “Full commissioning can therefore take place ahead of time.”\n\nLater on Saturday, the Polish government’s commissioner for strategic energy infrastructure, Mateusz Berger, confirmed the news to the Polish Press Agency (PAP) and revealed that the accelerated schedule would allow up to twice as much gas as planned to be imported in the final quarter of 2022.\n\nA day earlier, Norway’s state-owned energy giant Equinor had announced that it has entered into a 10-year agreement to sell 2.4 billion cubic metres (bcm) of natural per year – around 14% of Polish annual consumption – to Poland’s state gas firm PGNiG via the Baltic Pipe.\n\nPGNiG, which has booked around 80% of the pipeline’s capacity, said that its own output from the Norwegian shelf – estimated at around 3 bcm this year and 4 bcm annually in coming years – will make up most of the gas transported through the pipe, reports Reuters.\n\nThe Baltic Pipe, construction of which began in 2020, is around 900 kilometres long in total and is being built at a cost of at least €1.6 billion, reports PAP. Around €250 million of that total has been provided by the European Union.\n\nNorway’s Equinor has entered into a 10-year agreement to sell natural gas to Poland that will cover around 15% of Polish annual consumption. The gas will be transported through the new Baltic Pipe, which is due to open next week https://t.co/ZXRdv7uBtP — Notes from Poland 🇵🇱 (@notesfrompoland) September 24, 2022\n\nIn June, it was announced that the longest onshore element of the pipeline, 191-kilometre stretch running across Poland, had been completed ahead of schedule. The following month, Poland’s gas system operator, Gaz-System, revealed that the pipeline had been connected to the Polish and Danish transmission systems.\n\nThe pipeline is part of Poland’s long-running efforts to diversify away from Russian energy supplies. That included the opening of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Świnoujście in 2015 and another planned floating LNG terminal in Gdańsk.\n\nAfter Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Polish government accelerated such efforts, announcing that it would end all Russian energy imports this year. Subsequently, in April, Russia’s Gazprom cut off its supply of gas to Poland after Warsaw refused its demand to pay in roubles.\n\nMain image credit: Gaz-System press materials",

    "Kindred will stay in Norway and appeal daily fines": "Kindred has announced that it will remain in the Norwegian market, and appeal regulator Lotteritilsynet's decision to impose daily fines on its operations.\n\nLotteritilsynet announced that it would pursue the fines – of NOK1.198m (£103,700/€116,000/$111,700) for every day its Trannel subsidiary continues to operate in Norway – earlier this month.\n\nThe fine would come into effect three weeks from the day the regulator decided to issue it – which would be 5 October.\n\nEarlier this year, Lotteritilsynet warned Kindred to withdraw form the Norwegian market or pay this fine, but Kindred said it would stay in the market as the operator did not believe it was in breach of any laws.\n\nOn 23 September, Henrik Tjärnström, CEO of Kindred, said that Kindred will appeal the fine.\n\n“We will appeal the decision of the Lotteritilsynet regarding the issuance of this sanction fee and will continue operating as usual, as long as the legal process is ongoing,” said Tjärnström. “We want to see how it pans out.”\n\nTjärnström said that Kindred disagrees with the idea that it is operating in Norway illegally. While only two busnesses are licensed by Norwegian authorities to offer online gambling, Tjärnström argued that Kindred was permitted to operate under European law as it holds a licence in Malta and is therefore covered by free movement of services in the European Economic Area.\n\n“We dispute the claim that we have operations in Norway,” he continued. “We are licensed in Malta and believe that Norwegian customers under current European economic legislation have the right to play on foreign sites if they wish.”\n\n“There is nothing that sets Norway apart from other European states in that respect.”\n\nTjärnström also reiterated his belief that Norway would soon begin steps to create a fully regulated model where private operators can apply for licences.\n\n“Again, time will tell as the process proceeds,” said Tjärnström. “But we are not doing anything wrong in Norway today.”\n\n“We accept traffic from Norwegian customers who find us in Malta and that is part of the legal framework that in our opinion prevails here. That’s our position.”\n\n“We are confident that we are doing nothing wrong and look forward to moving towards a locally regulated market in Norway as well.”\n\nIn July, Kindred lost an earlier lawsuit regarding the fine and its presence in Norway, though it then took this to a higher court to be appealed.",

However, risks to the outlook are considerable, given the uncertainty over spillovers from the war in Ukraine, the intensity of the pandemic globally, and in Europe, in particular, and supply bottlenecks. Given the strong fundamentals, Norway is relatively shielded and there are both upside (higher energy prices and export volumes) and downside risks (lower demand from Europe for non-energy exports). The forecast is especially sensitive to where energy prices settle, whether energy supply to Europe will be disrupted, and Norway’s capacity to increase gas supplies to Europe.",
    "Tehran Rebukes Britain, Norway Over Commentary on Protests": "Iran has rebuked Britain and Norway over what it claimed was interference and hostile news coverage of the extensive unrest in Iran triggered by the death of a young woman held in captivity by the country’s morality police for failing to properly wear a hijab, the semi-official IRNA news agency said Sunday.\n\nIran’s Foreign Ministry summoned the British and Norwegian ambassadors Saturday to deliver the protests to the envoys.\n\nTehran cited the “hostile character” of the London-based Persian language media, while complaining to the Norwegian diplomat about the \"interventionist stance\" of the country's parliamentary speaker, who has expressed support for the protesters on Twitter.\n\nDemonstrations erupted more than a week ago across Iran, with protesters angered by the death on September 16 of a 22-year-old Kurdish woman, Mahsa Amini. It was the biggest wave of protests against the government in years.\n\nJake Sullivan, U.S. President Joe Biden’s national security adviser, told ABC’s “This Week” show on Sunday that the Iranian protests “reflect a widespread belief that [the demonstrators] deserve their dignity and rights” and that the U.S. supports them.\n\nHe said the U.S. supports people “who stand up for their rights.”\n\nIran’s judiciary chief, Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei, on Sunday \"emphasized the need for decisive action without leniency\" against the core instigators of the \"riots,\" the judiciary's Mizan Online website said, according to Agence France-Presse.\n\nEuropean Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Sunday that Iran's crackdown on protests is \"unjustifiable\" and \"unacceptable,\" as Tehran vowed no leniency against the unrest gripping the country, AFP reported.\n\nIn a statement on behalf of the EU, Borrell said moves \"to severely restrict internet access by the relevant Iranian authorities and to block instant messaging platforms is a further cause for concern, as it blatantly violates freedom of expression.”\n\nSome Iranian women have publicly cut their hair or burned their headscarves in the streets as angry crowds have called for the downfall of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nIran’s state television says 41 people have been killed.

    "Norway Wind Farm Might Close—Because It’s Too Windy": "Parts of wind turbines have fallen in strong winds in Northern Norway. The Norwegian government has threatened to close down the wind farm unless improvements are made.\n\nNorway is no stranger to renewable energy. Despite the economic boom of oil and gas, much of the country’s domestic energy use comes from hydropower. Recent years have seen more wind turbines pop up across the country.\n\nBut there have been problems. Local opposition has delayed or even stopped many projects. Now, technical problems at a large wind farm in the north of Norway threaten its closure.\n\nSince 2020, at least seven objects from the wind turbines at the Ånstadblåheia wind farm near Sortland have fallen to the ground in strong winds. The Norwegian Directorate of Water and Energy (NVE) is taking the situation seriously.\n\nIn fact, NVE has given formal notice that the facility will be closed if it cannot be repaired by 10 October. “We record repeated falling objects from the turbines linked to strong winds. This should not happen,” said NVE section manager Anne Johanne Kråkenes to NRK.\n\nA very windy location\n\nThe 14 turbines of Ånstadblåheia wind power plant are located on a hilltop in Sortland municipality, part of the Vesterålen islands.\n\nVesterålen is known for high winds and harsh weather.\n\nThe northern archipelago is known as a very windy place, so in theory wind turbines are the ideal solution for sustainsble energy.\n\n“The weather and wind in Vesterålen is probably one of the toughest things you can subject such machinery to,” said a power plant spokesperson to NRK.\n\nUnder normal operating conditions, Ånstadblåheia produces around 140-150 gigawatt hours of electricity a year. This corresponds to the annual energy consumption of around 7,500 Norwegian households.\n\nAn unusual situation\n\nAny wind power plant located on the coast of Northern Norway must be designed to withstand strong winds and harsh weather.\n\nNevertheless, strong winds and falling ice have caused the cover, panels and other parts to fall to the ground. This presents an onvious danger to local people and animals.\n\nNVE described the situation as “unusual” and something they have not seen at other similar wind power plants. “They have made some improvements. But we note that unwanted incidents still occur,” said Kråkenes.\n\nTechnicians are now busy installing new covers at the wind power plant. But its very much the last chance for the wind farm. Many locals wouldn’t be disappointed to see its closure.\n\nUnhappy locals\n\nEditor of the local newspaper, Morten Berg-Hansen, said many people were skeptical about the wind farm.\n\n“In the last two years it has not been safe to travel on the mountain. Although the facility is now being equipped for the future, and the surrounding area made safe, the reputation is damaged,” he said.",
    "NEP Norway Expands SMPTE ST 2110 Operation": "NEP Norway Expands SMPTE ST 2110 Operation\n\nStory Highlights\n\nMediaproxy has continued its working relationship with outside broadcast and playout facilities group NEP by supplying its LogServer software for SMPTE ST 2110 recording at its Norwegian operation.\n\nNEP Norway first began using Mediaproxy software in 2017, when it chose LogServer for its next generation compliance recording on the SDI channels distributed from its playout center. This replaced a custom-built system and when the company needed a logging system for new ST 2110 services, the decision was taken to expand the installation, which was facilitated thanks to easy software-based integration for uncompressed IP video sources.\n\nThe new channel platform was installed in the second quarter of this year and as well as compliance monitoring it is also used to check problems on already-broadcast programs, while the As-run feature provides a record for advertisers of what has been sent to air.\n\nMediaproxy LogServer is a software-based IP logging and analysis system that supports SMPTE ST 2110, NMOS and SCTE ad-insertion. Delivering reliable compliance monitoring and recording of program output to meet broadcast standards and regulations, it can integrate seamlessly with cloud, virtual or on-premises workflows. The platform also supports video, audio and real-time data from sources including 4K, HDR, 10-bit, HEVC, TSoIP, SMPTE 2110, Zixi and SRT.\n\nNEP Norway technical manager Rune Olsen sees the key benefits of LogServer as being its ease of use and stability, plus excellent support from Mediaproxy. “The software has worked without a hitch from the get-go and Mediaproxy is very fast in responding to any questions we may have,” he says. “The interface is also very easy and efficient to use. It just works and does the work it is supposed to do.”\n\n“We are very pleased to continue our association with NEP Norway, which has entered a new and exciting phase in its business development by expanding into SMPTE ST 2110,” comments Mediaproxy’s Rajesh Patel, Vice President of Sales and Solutions for Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA). “Our company has been involved in the development of ST 2110 from the very start through our membership of AIMS. While it is now established and widely used in broadcasting, ST 2110 continues to be a leading edge technology that we at Mediaproxy are supporting through investment in engineering that allows us to fulfil customer demands for new technologies very quickly.”",

    "Norway renews commitment to World Heritage Leadership": "Initiated in 2016, the World Heritage Leadership Programme aims to improve heritage practices in the culture and nature sectors. It provides guidance and tools to conserve World Heritage effectively and fosters networks for peer learning.\n\nWorld Heritage Leadership empowers heritage practitioners across the globe with the tools and capacity to deliver excellence in the management of the planet’s most iconic places,” said Grethel Aguilar, IUCN Deputy Director General. “IUCN is proud to collaborate with ICCROM, and our many partners, on such a valuable initiative for the World Heritage community. We thank sincerely Norway for their continued engagement and support for this vital work.”\n\nIn its first phase running up to 2022, the programme successfully completed new and updated resources seen as essential for the effective management of World Heritage sites. These include the recently launched Guidance and Toolkit for Impact Assessment in a World Heritage context. The programme also held numerous courses in different regions and on various topics, such as nature-culture linkages, disaster risk reduction, and community engagement.\n\nIn its second phase, the World Heritage Leadership Programme will focus on strengthening regional networks, working with various actors and institutions from the local to global levels. One of its main aims will be to multiply capacity-building opportunities for heritage practitioners and improve access by delivering them in diverse languages and contexts.\n\nManaging World Heritage in the 21st century is a complex task and we need to build our own capacities to do our jobs better,” said ICCROM Director-General Webber Ndoro. “The best way to do that is to learn from each other and support each other, tapping into a global family working together to protect and conserve World Heritage. We extend our deep gratitude to Norway for recognizing the pressing need to continue developing present and future generations’ capacity to care for our precious World Heritage.”\n\nWorld Heritage sites are internationally recognised as places so valuable to humanity that they must be protected from one generation to the next. They include iconic sites such as the Great Barrier Reef, Machu Picchu, or the West Norwegian Fjords. Despite their high profile, they face increasing pressure from various threats such as natural disasters, conflict and unsustainable development. Climate change is the top threat to the 252 natural World Heritage sites listed up to 2020, according to the IUCN World Heritage Outlook.\n\nNorway’s continued support for World Heritage Leadership recognises that practitioners involved in the conservation of these exceptional sites have a crucial role to play in ensuring their effective management. Its commitment to the second phase of the programme extends to strengthening the capacity of heritage professionals of the next generation.\n\n“World Heritage properties are global common goods. Norway attaches particular importance to the capacity-building work to ensure that all countries are enabled to preserving and benefitting from their own cultural and natural heritage,” said Aleksander Øren Heen, State Secretary at the Norwegian Ministry of Climate and Environment. “Good, long-term management of a nation’s cultural and natural heritage is essential for sustainable development.”\n\nThe new phase of commitment was announced at the World Heritage Leadership Forum on 21 September 2022. High-level delegates at the event reflected on how capacity building has contributed to the first 50 years of implementation of the World Heritage Convention, and how to strengthen it in the future.",
    "Hurtigruten Norway launches its first hybrid ship": "Hurtigruten Norway has launched its first environmentally-upgraded battery-hybrid powered ship, MS Richard With. It is the first of seven in the Coastal Express fleet to be upgraded, and now features technology that will significantly reduce both CO2 and Nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions.\n\nAs part of a major effort to make Hurtigruten Norway’s fleet more sustainable, the company has invested nearly 100 million Euros towards green upgrades that will be implemented by early 2024.\n\nThis move follows its sister company, Hurtigruten Expeditions, introducing the world’s first battery-hybrid powered expedition ship, MS Roald Amundsen, in 2019. The expedition cruise brand now has three battery-hybrid powered ships in its fleet.\n\nBecoming a green company means investing in efforts with documented effects, such as the ones we are doing now. As a result, by next summer, we will have three upgraded hybrid ships sailing the coast, and our entire fleet will be more energy efficient, cutting CO2-emissions by 25% and NOx by 80%\n\nsaid Hedda Felin, CEO of Hurtigruten Norway.\n\nMS Richard With has gone through extensive upgrades and been retrofitted with battery packages, brand new engines, and new propulsion systems at Myklebust Yard in northwestern Norway. All Hurtigruten Norway’s seven ships will also be fitted with SCR systems that cut NOx emissions by a massive 80% by early 2024.\n\nThis is one of the largest environmental upgrades of its kind in Europe, and the largest in Hurtigruten’s history. The fact that we have made these upgrades at Myklebust Yard, with as much Norwegian technology as possible, is no coincidence\n\nMs. Felin stated, adding that “our goal is to get to zero emissions, and the work to plan the next generation zero emission vessels has already started. Until that technology has been pioneered, we are investing heavily in giving our existing fleet a green upgrade with the best technology available today, but our plan is to have the first emission-free ship in our fleet by 2030, and we’re working hard on achieving that.”",
    "Norway’s Family Immigration Permit Explained": "There’s a lot of confusion out there about the family immigration permit offered by Norway. Here’s what you need to know.\n\nAs anyone who has done it will surely agree, moving to any country is a complicated process. There’s a lot of different categories of residence permits with many terms and conditions, ifs and buts.\n\nOne of those conditions is related to whether you can bring your family with you or not. A work permit is an individual permit and doesn’t automatically mean your partner or other close family member can accompany you.\n\nIf you’re planning on moving to Norway to work, your partner or children can usually join you but they will need to apply for a different permit.\n\nIntroducing family immigration\n\nNorway’s immigration rules offer a specific residence permit available for family members of someone who already holds a residence permit. This is known as family immigration.\n\nThere’s a lot of misinformation out there about what family immigration means. For example, we are often contacted by people who have Norwegian ancestry and assume the family immigration permit applies to them. This is not the case.\n\nThis article rounds up the basic principles of family immigration in Norway. The rules are different depending on the country of citizenship of the people involved, the family relationship, and the type of residence permit held by the person already living in Norway.\n\nAs always, the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration (UDI) has all the official information. You should verify what applies to your own circumstances on their website, as there are too many exceptions and conditions to cover every single on in this post.\n\nWho can apply for family immigration?\n\nThere are several categories of relation who can apply for a family immigration permit.\n\nPartners\n\nFirstly, if your spouse, long-term partner or cohabitant holds a residence permit in Norway, you are eligible to apply. You can usually do this at the same time as your partner applies for a skilled worker visa, and you should get your answer at the same time.\n\nMarriages of convenience and forced marriages are not permitted. Both partners must also have plans to live together in Norway. In the case of cohabitants, they must have lived together for at least two years and both be over the age of 24.\n\nIf the partner with residence in Norway is not an EU/EEA citizen, they must usually prove an income of NOK 300,988 per year and cannot have received financial aid from Nav in the prior 12 months.\n\nThere are reductions and/or exemptions to the income requirement for those who have been granted asylum in Norway. This is especially true within the first year as a refugee.\n\nChildren\n\nFor EU/EEA citizens, children under the age of 21 can join a parent or parents living in Norway by using the registration program for EU/EEA nationals.\n\nFor non-EU/EEA citizens, children under 18 can join a parent or parents living in Norway. The parent must have an income of at least NOK 300,988 and hold a valid work permit or study permit. If only one parent is living in Norway, the other parent must give their consent.\n\nAs with the rules for partners, there are exceptions to the income requirements for successful asylum seekers who wish to bring their children to Norway, but this must be done within the first year.\n\nParents\n\nFor EU/EEA citizens, a parent, grandparent, or great-grandparent who is already being supported by the family member in Norway is eligible to apply for family immigration. This doesn’t apply for those holding study permits.\n\nAs per the terms of the EU/EEA registration program, the parent will need to get a job, start a program of study, or prove they have sufficient funds.\n\nNon-EU/EEA parents of adult children living in Norway are usually not permitted to apply for family immigration. However, exceptions are made for a single parent that has no parents, children, or great-grandchildren in their home country. In this case, the income requirement applies to the child living in Norway.\n\nIt’s also possible for a parent to apply for family immigration in order to visit an adult child for up to nine months. This permit cannot be renewed, but it can be applied for again after one year of the permit expiring.\n\nOther family members\n\nThe rules for other family members coming to Norway vary considerably. As a general rule, other family members cannot join non-EU/EEA citizens living in Norway.\n\nUDI states that exceptions to this are assessed but they would only be granted when “strong humanitarian considerations” apply.\n\nFor EU/EEA citizens, it’s possible for siblings without care providers to apply for family immigration. This also applies for family members with serious health problems and nursing needs, if the person living in Norway is the only person that can provide care.\n\nMoving to join a Norwegian citizen\n\nIf the family member already living in Norway is a Norwegian citizen, some of the rules are a little different.\n\nNon-EU/EEA spouses and cohabitants can apply for family immigration as long as they have previously lived together, are expecting a child together, or are planning to get married in Norway within the next six months. The income requirement applies to the Norwegian citizen.\n\nSimilar rules apply for parents and children of Norwegian citizens. In addition, a person who had a Norwegian parent when they were born can apply for family immigration, but they must prove an income of NOK 278,693. The Norwegian parent must have held Norwegian citizenship at the time.\n\nWhat can you do with a family immigration permit?\n\nIn general, family immigration permits allow you to work in Norway. They also allow you to apply for permanent residence after five years, should you meet the other requirements.\n\nEventually, you would be able to apply for Norwegian citizenship, should you meet all the other criteria such as language ability.\n\nSome people given family immigration permits can access free Norwegian language lessons, but do have an obligation to complete them. Free lessons are not available to those who do not have an obligation to complete them, including EU/EEA citizens.\n\nHow to apply for family immigration\n\nThe application process begins online at the UDI website. Depending on your circumstances you may be able to hand in the required documents at a police station in Norway, or at your nearest Norwegian Embassy or Consulate.\n\nApplicants must pay a substantial application fee. At present, this is NOK 10,500 for a first-time applicant. Renewals are a lot cheaper, and there are lower fees for some categories.\n\nThe documents you need for your application will be made clear to you during the application process on the UDI website.\n\nHow long does family immigration take?\n\nThere is no single waiting time for family immigration applications. It depends on many factors including the type of residence permit the person in Norway has, your family relationship, and where you hand in your application.\n\nIn very general terms, 3-4 months is common, but it can take up to 10 months in some cases.\n\nIf you submit an application for family immigration at the same time as your family member submits one for a work permit (for example), you should recieve the responses together.\n\nIn some cases, UDI may conduct additional investigations to verify identity and other circumstances. This could include an interview with the Norwegian police and even a DNA test to verify a family link. The waiting time for these cases varies considerably.\n\nIt is possible to appeal against a rejection, but this process is also a lengthy one. UDI states a waiting time of up to 12 months for appeals.\n\nProblems with family immigration permits\n\nEarlier this year, UDI identified several cases of fraud in family immigration applications. These included false income and employment claims.\n\nBoth UDI and the Immigration Appeals Board (UNE) sometimes see issues with the size of the salary and whether the job even exists. This most commonly occurs with construction jobs and the hospitality and service industry.",
    "Norway’s ’Salmon Eye’ Opens in Hardangerfjord": "Accessible only by ferry, the floating exhibition space is designed to inform visitors about aquaculture and the future of the seafood industry.\n\nEide Fjordbruk is an established salmon producer in Norway’s Hardangerfjord region. The third-generation owners Sondre and Erlend Eide wanted to remember their father while creating something of value.\n\nSalmon Eye launch event in the Hardangerfjord, Photo: Kvorning Design.\n\nThe result? Salmon Eye, a new floating installation and forum space that’s designed to educate visitors on sustainable seafood, fish farming and the production of Norwegian salmon.\n\nSeafood is a huge success story for Norwegian industry, second only to oil and gas. The export value of salmon is twice the amount of all other fish combined. However, there are critics of some of the industry practices.\n\nThe idea for the project began in 2019. Kvorning Design‘s experimental plans were revealed in 2021 and the building completed in August 2022, in time for the unveiling event in the Hardangerfjord earlier this week.\n\nExperimental design becomes a reality\n\nBold architectural designs are nothing new these days, especially in Scandinavia. But very few of them actually become a reality.\n\nSalmon Eye exhibition centre in the Hardangerfjord. Photo: Kvorning Design.\n\nDanish firm Kvorning Design stated their gratitude to the Eide family for their trust and cooperation with the design and communications firm around the realization of the experiential design for Salmon Eye.\n\nThe basis for the design was a fish eye with a hole on top of the architecture. Based on this, the curved, floating architecture and art installation is covered in 9,500 stainless steel plates designed to imitate the appearance and colour of fish scales.\n\nSalmon Eye weighs 1,256 tonnes and is 25 meters in diameter. Also designed by Kvorning Design, the interior features 650 square metres of space. It’s divided into four floors, one of which is underwater.\n\nSalmon Eye as an educational space\n\nThe forum element of Salmon Eye is an immersive audio-visual space designed to inform visitors about the aquaculture of sea farming and what harms and protects the sea and its species.\n\nSalmon is an important export industry for Norway.\n\nAccording to Eide, it is designed to help visitors recognise the ocean as an important food source, educate them on seafood practices of today and what future standards in aquaculture might look like.\n\nPlanned events include talks that aim to inspire, share ideas, and discuss the importance of sustainable aquaculture with its guests.\n\nEide’s environmental push\n\nThe Salmon Eye is undoubtedly a passion project for the brothers Sondre and Erlend Eide, the third generation in the family’s business. With some critical of the environmental impact of salmon farming in Norway, Eide is hoping to change people’s minds.\n\nEide Fjordbruk was the first fish farming company to produce carbon-neutral salmon, and the first to present environmental accounts. The company has introduced all-electric boats and facilities.\n\nThe firm will shortly unveil a new technology known as “Watermoon”, which it states enables farming in the fjord and sea with no negative impact on the environment or climate.\n\nWhat do you think of the Salmon Eye?",
    "Norway August Oil Production Rebounds": "grandriver\n\nA guest post by Ovi\n\nTypically, the POB posts have a theme. However, due to EIA schedule changes for issuing their reports and missing EIA reports, this post contains oil production updates for several Non-OPEC countries, plus the September DPR report. The country updates come from a combination of official country websites and news articles.\n\nThe Norway Petroleum Directorate (NPD) reported that production rebounded from June to July to 1,664 kb/d and then rose to 1,773 kb/d in August. (Red markers.). According to the NPD: “Oil production in August was 3.1 percent lower than the NPD’s forecast and 4.7 percent lower than the forecast so far this year.”\n\nThe rebound from the June low is due to the end of summer maintenance and possibly the start up of the second phase of the Johan Sverdrup field along with some other small fields.\n\nAccording to OPEC: “For 2022, production growth is expected to decrease by 43 tb/d y-o-y to average 2.0 mb/d. Norwegian liquid output dropped by 12% in 2Q22 to 1.74 mb/d, mainly because of maintenance at offshore platforms. In addition to some small start-ups, growth is expected in 4Q22, following the return from maintenance and second-phase production start-up of the Johan Sverdrup field.\n\nFor 2023, Norwegian liquids production is forecast to grow by 0.24 mb/d, unchanged from the previous month, to average 2.2 mb/d. Plenty of projects, from small to large, are scheduled to ramp up in 2023 in the Njord, Nova, Ringhorne, Alvheim, Oseberg and Snohvit fields. However, Johan Sverdrup is projected to be the main source of increased output for the year, making up roughly 35% of total Norway’s crude and condensate output.”\n\nChina reported that its output decreased in August to 3,989 kb/d, a drop of close to 200 kb/d from June. (Red markers)\n\nChina may be close to its current maximum production level of close to 4,000 kb/d. To offset declines, the national oil company is investing in conventional wells and also drilling for Shale Oil. See Below.\n\nAccording to OPEC: “Natural decline rates are expected to be offset by the Chinese national oil company’s considerable investments. Tianjin, Xinjiang, Heilongjiang, and Shaanxi were the main producing provinces in the first half of the year. Chinese companies expect additional growth through more in-fill wells and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects.\n\nFor 2023, y-o-y growth of 30 tb/d is forecast for an average of 4.5 m/d, with Bozhong 29-6, Wushi 17-2 and Kenli 10-1N planned to come on stream under the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC). At the same time, ramp-ups are expected from the Changqing, Jilin and Liaohe projects, which are managed by Petro China. The new projects will slightly offset declines from the mature onshore production base.”\n\nAccording to this source, China’s CNOOC has found shale oil in its South China Sea exploration well for the first time.\n\n“CNOOC believes that the Beibu gulf contains 8.76 billion barrels of shale oil, and claimed that the wildcat well flowed 20 cubic metres/day (m³/d) (125.8 b/d) of shale oil and 1,589m³/d (56,092 ft^3/d) of natural gas, which the Chinese oil giant is calling a commercial discovery.”\n\nAccording to this source, August production fell after rebounding in July. The article just reports Crude oil production. Consequently the August number shown in is an estimate based on the percentage drop and a typical C + C to C ratio using earlier EIA data.\n\n“The fall in output was due to a sharp decline in production in the giant Kashagan oil field after a gas leak early in August, as well as planned output curbs in the Tengiz field due to regular maintenance.”\n\nMexico’s oil production increased by 10 kb/d in August to 1,797 kb/d. This is the third increase since May. Note that the red markers will be reduced by the EIA by close to 80 kb/d. Pemex reported production for May was 1,775 kb/d. The EIA reduced it to 1,695 kb/d, a reduction of 80 kb/d, due to a different definition for C + C.\n\nAccording to this source, August production fell by 30 kb/d from July’s output of 10,460 kb/d to 10,430 kb/d. In addition, this source revised down the original June output from 10,760 kb/d to 10,667 kb/d, a downward revision of 93 kb/d.\n\nAccording to this source, UK production dropped in May to 701 kb/d and then rebounded in July to 734 kb/d. Clearly UK production is in decline.\n\nGuyana added an additional 30 kb/d of production in August to reach new high of 390 kb/d. According to the chart below, the operating companies appear to be ahead of schedule on production.\n\nGuyana production schedule.\n\nThis chart shows Saudi Arabia’a oil stocks starting in 2019. In October 2015, SA had 326 million barrels in storage. Between then and January 2019, their stocks were reduced by 126 M barrels. During most of 2021, stocks bounced around 132 M barrels. In 2022, they have slowly risen to 142 M barrels in July\n\nOn September 23, 2022, WTI settled below the psychological level of $80/b. OPEC has stated that $80/b Brent is a fair price for both producers and consumers. More recently, some OPEC spoke persons have indicated their preferred level has drifted up to $90/b.\n\nRigs and Fracs\n\nThe rig story continues to be that the US Rig count has been holding steady at close to 545 rigs for the past seven weeks. In the week ending September 26, the rig count was unchanged from the previous week at 545. That was down six rigs from July 29 when 551 were operating.\n\nThe Permian rose by 1 rig to 322 and is down 9 rigs from a high of 331 on July 1. Note that 59% of the Hz rigs are located in the Permian.\n\nTexas dropped by 2 to 304 and is essentially unchanged relative to May 20 when 303 were operating.\n\nAfter New Mexico dropped 7 rigs in the first week of August to 96, the rig count has slowly increased to back above 100 to 101. The general trend in the New Mexico Permian has been to add an average of 0.57 rigs per week. This contrasts with the overall Permian trend shown above which has been in a slight down trend.\n\nFrac spreads have not shown any growth over the last six months. A high of 290 was reached on February 25 and was not surpassed till July 29, 295. For the week ending September 23, 1 frac spread was added for a total of 288.\n\nDrilling Productivity Report\n\nThe Drilling Productivity Report (DPR) uses recent data on the total number of drilling rigs in operation along with estimates of drilling productivity and estimated changes in production from existing oil wells to provide estimated changes in oil production for the principal tight oil regions. The September DPR forecasts production to October 2022 and the following charts are updated to October 2022.\n\nAbove is the total oil production projected to October 2022 for the 7 DPR basins that the EIA tracks. Note that DPR production includes both LTO oil and oil from conventional wells.\n\nThe September DPR report has downwardly revised the April to September production forecast. The original forecast for August 2022 was 9,069 kb/d. The revised estimate for August is 8,845 kb/d, a downward revision of 224 kb/d. Of the 224 kb/d, 59 kb/d can be attributed to the DPR revising the Bakken April output down by 59 kb/d due to the April/May storm.\n\nThe DPR is projecting that oil output for October 2022 will increase by 132 kb/d to 9,116 kb/d. From April’s output of 8,352 kb/d to October’s 2022, output in the DPR basins is forecast to increase by 764 kb/d or by an average of 127 kb/d/mth.\n\nPermian output continues to increase. In October, production is expected to increase by 66 kb/d to a new high of 5,413 kb/d. From May to September, production is forecast to increase by 346 kb/d or at an average rate of 69.2 kb/d/mth. If the Permian were part of OPEC, at 5,413 kb/d it would be the second largest producer after Saudi Arabia.\n\nDuring August, 416 wells were drilled and 435 were completed in the Permian. (Note that August is the latest data for DUC info). The completed wells added 378 kb/d to August’s output for an average of 870 b/d/well. The overall decline was 292 kb/d which resulted in a net increase for Permian output of 86 kb/d. Of the 435 completed wells, 336 were required to offset the decline. The completion of 19 extra DUCs over the drilled wells contributed 16.5 kb/d of the overall 86 kb/d increase.\n\nOutput in the Eagle Ford basin has been showing an increasing trend since March 2022. For October, output is expected to increase by 26 kb/d to 1,250 kb/d. At the beginning of the year, 43 rigs were operating in the EF. As of September, 66 are operational and accounts for the increasing production.\n\nThe DPR forecasts Bakken output in October to be 1,204 kb/d an increase of 21 kb/d from September.\n\nThis chart shows the Bakken’s output as reported by the North Dakota government. July production was reported to be 1,027 kb/d down 28 kb/d from June. The DPR Bakken chart above shows July production to be 1,143 kb/d, 16 kb/d higher.\n\nOutput in the Niobrara continues to increase slowly. October output increased by 9 kb/d to 657 kb/d.\n\nDUCs and Drilled Wells\n\nThe number of DUCs available for completion in the Permian and the four major DPR oil basins has continued to fall every month since July 2020. Prior to July 2020 more wells were drilled than were completed. The last two data points show how the use of DUCs continues to slow and is further illustrated in the next chart.\n\nWhile this chart is titled “Excess of Completed Wells over Drilled”, it could also have been called “Monthly change in DUC completion rate” because the excess of completed wells in a given month is equal to the change in the DUC completion rate.\n\nIn these four primarily oil basins, the change in monthly completion rate of DUCs started slowing after peaking in March 2021. In August 2022, 9 fewer DUCs (2,571 to 2,562) remained than in July. Similarly the monthly completion rate for DUCs in the Permian continues to fall. In August, the number of remaining DUCs fell by 19 (1,180 to 1,161). Note that since Permian excess wells were greater than in all four basins combined, a few basins drilled more wells than were completed. For instance in the Niobrara, 119 wells were drilled and 110 were completed.\n\nIn the Permian, the monthly completion rate has been showing signs of slowing since the recent March peak of 444. This is consistent with the frac spread chart shown above where there has been no growth in frac spreads since February.\n\nIn August 435 wells were completed, 4 fewer than in July and 9 fewer than in March. During August, 416 new wells were drilled, a decrease of 2 over July. This is the first time that there was a MoM drop in drilled wells. The gap between drilled and completed wells in the Permian has reached a new current low of 19 DUCs, which is the same as reported in the previous chart.\n\nOriginal Post\n\nEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.",
    "To keep arming Ukraine, Norway may drop munitions stocks below required levels": "WASHINGTON — Norway is considering letting stocks of key munitions drop below their required levels, accepting greater vulnerability in the short term as the price the northern European nation is willing to pay to keep up the flow of weaponry to Ukraine.\n\nThe move would coincide with a longer-term push to raise the required baseline for munitions stockpiles to new, higher levels down the road. In other words, Norway is prepared to take on short term risk to keep Russia tied up in Ukraine, while looking to expand stockpiles in the future when munition production is more readily available.\n\nThe idea was still conceptual, and would need approval of Norway’s parliament. But Norwegian defense minister Bjørn Arild Gram, speaking to a small group of reporters while in Washington this week, said that getting the balance right between present and future planning is going to be a major focus over the coming months.\n\n“We are more looking how we can increase the stocks from previous levels. But we are looking into if you can take even more from our stocks in the short term to support Ukraine. And to then to refill it,” he said. “Obviously we want to increase that even more, but maybe in the short term, we are donating.”\n\nAn aide to the minister noted that “we are at the point where we are looking to go lower because of the situation [in Ukraine] of course, but … longer term that is certainly pointing to an increase. So maybe [taking on] more risk now” with an eye towards the future.\n\n“More and more it will be about cooperating with industry and purchasing new equipment,” Gram added.\n\nRELATED: Norwegian air chief: Russia isn’t ’10 feet tall,’ but don’t discount it\n\nThere is growing concern on both sides of the Atlantic about munition stocks and how quickly industry can replace the weapons being donated to Ukraine. In July, the defense minister from The Netherlands described the situation as everyone “standing in line at the ammunition factories” and called for more coordination among industry. The Pentagon plans to host a meeting of European armaments leaders to figure out how best to coordinate such efforts, even as US firms struggle to keep up with demand for some of the highest-profile weapons being used by Kyiv.\n\nFor Norway, the majority of what has been sent to Ukraine was equipment that was being phased out of active use by the Norwegian military, Gram said. According to a Norwegian fact sheet, the following gear has been either shipped or is in the process of being shipped to Ukraine:\n\n4,000 M72 anti-tank weapons\n\n1,500 bulletproof vests, 5,000 helmets, 15,000 field rations, 1,000 protective masks with filters, 2,000 sleeping bags, 10,000 sleeping mats, some night vision equipment and some clothing\n\nApproximately 100 Mistral air defense missiles and a number of launchers\n\n22 M109 howitzers, including related gear, spare parts and ammunition\n\nMLRS long-range rocket artillery system, provided by a partnership between Norway and the United Kingdom\n\n14 Iveco LAV III Armored Vehicles\n\nApproximately 160 Hellfire missiles with supporting equipment\n\nIn addition to the MLRS, the Kingdom has teamed with the UK on three initiatives: training Ukrainian forces in the United Kingdom, jointly funding the acquisition of the Norwegian micro-drone Black Hornet system (Norway is contributing NOK 90 million, or $8.5 million USD, to that effort), and contributing NOK 400 million ($38.4 million) to a UK-led fund for procurement and transportation of weapons to Ukraine.\n\nAsked what might come next, Gram declined to go into detail.\n\n“Beyond that, I won’t speculate too much in what can be future donations,” he said. “It will be a mix of what we take from our own stocks, what we buy from the industry, what we finance to other countries supplying Ukraine. So is will be a combination of that.”",

There are several versions of the famous painting, including an 1893 version of the work in crayon.\n\nThere is also an iconic 1910 tempera-and-oil version, which was painted on cardboard. The museum also has six hand-coloured versions of the 1895 black-and-white lithograph.\n\nHowever, the paintings are fragile and will be rotated frequently to limit degradation. The Munch Museum has an innovative design and a sustainable approach to environmental sustainability.\n\nThe MUNCH building features airlocks for temperature and humidity control, and connects to the city’s district heating and cooling system.\n\nThe building is also fitted with an energy control system, and has no visitor parking spaces. The museum’s surrounding area has 100 bike-parking spaces.\n\nThe Royal Palace #4\n\nThe Royal Palace in Oslo is the official residence of the Norwegian monarch. It was built in the early 19th century for French-born King Charles III John, who reigned as king of Norway and Sweden.\n\nThe palace is still in use today, and is home to the current monarch. The Crown Prince, however, resides at Skaugum in Asker, west of Oslo.\n\nThe royal residence has undergone a number of renovations. In 1913, a major project to renovate the palace was launched.\n\nThe new design was based on Bernini’s designs for the Louvre, but Juvarra’s untimely death prevented him from seeing the finished project through to completion.\n\nIn the interim, a different architect, Giambattista Sacchetti (born Juan Bautista Sacchetti and Giovanni Battista Sacchetti), was hired to do the work.\n\nSlottsplassen 1, 0010 Oslo, Norway\n\nThe new palace had a large square courtyard and projecting wings that solved sightline problems. The Royal Palace is surrounded by a beautiful park, complete with lawns and small ponds.\n\nVisitors can tour the grounds and the chapel, which is open on Sundays at 11am. In addition, guided tours are planned for the summer season of 2022.\n\nThe Palace is home to a variety of events and activities. Tours of the royal palace began in 2002. Many visitors noted the beauty of the grounds and the beautiful exterior.\n\nThe palace also houses a museum and concert hall, and the former stables have been converted into a multipurpose arts venue.\n\nThe Akershus Fortress #5\n\nThe Akershus Fortress in Denmark was built in the 14th century by King Haakon the Fifth. Originally, it was a defense against an attack by a Swedish earl.\n\nLater, the fortress became a residence for Princess Margaret of Denmark, who became Haakon’s wife in 1363.\n\nWhen her son died, she became regent and united Norway, Denmark, and Sweden in the Kalmar Union. The union lasted until 1523. After that, Norway and Denmark remained united until 1814.\n\nThe fortress has self-guided tours, which can be taken through the buildings. The visitor center is located in the 1774 artillery building.\n\nThe tour explores the fort’s history and includes the medieval walls, the military barracks, and the courtyard of the Akershus Castle. The fortress was a place of great importance during the renaissance.\n\n0150 Oslo, Norway\n\nIt was a royal residence, but when Oslo became the capital, the fortress’s function changed. The outer parts of the fortress were released for public use as building plots.\n\nThe ramparts were also turned into a recreational area for the public. The fortress was also home to a prison.\n\nDuring the 17th century, King Fredrik III ordered that prisoners be forced to work in chains on the fortress.\n\nThe prisoners were forced to perform all sorts of public works, and some were hired out to private parties. The castle was damaged by lightning in 1527.\n\nAfter this, peasants from the nearby Romerike district were brought in to rebuild the castle. Their names were later incorporated into one of the main halls of the castle.\n\nThe Museum of Cultural History #6\n\nThe Museum of Cultural History is an association of museums under the University of Oslo. It was originally known as Universitetets kulturhistoriske museum.\n\nSeveral museums in Norway are part of this organization. The goal is to preserve and present cultural heritage from around the world. Today, the collection includes collections from more than 100 countries.\n\nThe museum features exhibits from ancient to modern times. The collection also includes works of art and crafts from different parts of the world.\n\nVisitors can explore Stone Age tools and Cape Dutch furniture, as well as traditional tribal crafts. The museum also features a large taxidermy exhibit featuring native animals.\n\nThere is no admission fee, but special exhibitions may incur extra fees. The Museum of Cultural History is an excellent place to learn about Norway’s history.\n\nFrederiksgate 2, Oslo, Norway\n\nIts collection includes over three million items, spanning from the Stone Age to the Middle Ages. It also exhibits a wide range of cultural artifacts that reflect Norway’s diverse cultures.\n\nThe museum also has interdisciplinary research groups and is part of international networks. Olav Aaraas, born in 1950, has been the museum’s director since 2001.\n\nHe has overseen several projects since taking over. Renovating the restaurant, building a large amphitheatre, and reassembling the chapel Bethlehem from Hinna on Jaeren are some of his many projects.\n\nIn addition, the museum has recently completed work on reconstructing the elegant townhouse Collettgarden.\n\nOslofjord by Boat #7\n\nOne of the best ways to explore the Oslofjord is by boat. Fortunately, there are several options for doing so. You can either choose to take a tour guided by a local expert, or simply enjoy a relaxing day at sea.\n\nNo matter which option you choose, you’re sure to enjoy this unique part of Norway. The Oslofjord is a 120-kilometre-long fjord that leads into the city of Oslo, the capital of Norway.\n\nThe waterway provides the city with a natural harbour and has long been used to keep invaders out.\n\nOslo fjord. Oslo, Norway\n\nIt is home to the Akershus Fortress, which was vital in preventing the Nazis from taking over Norway during the Second World War.\n\nDuring a scenic cruise through Oslofjord, you can admire the picturesque islands and picturesque vistas of the region. The Oslofjord offers a diverse landscape, with fjord islands, steep hills and forested areas.\n\nYou’ll also be able to view some of the city’s most iconic views. The Oslofjord is an important part of Norway’s history.\n\nIt’s home to many shipwrecks, including the German heavy cruiser Blucher, which sank in Drobak in 1940. This ship had been sent to invade Oslo, but was hit by torpedoes and cannons during its attack.\n\nThe Fram Museum #8\n\nLocated on the peninsula of Bygdy in Oslo, the Fram Museum tells the story of Norwegian polar exploration.\n\nThe museum houses more than one thousand objects that trace the history of polar exploration in Norway. There are also interactive exhibits and educational displays.\n\nVisiting the museum will help you understand the importance of polar exploration and the challenges it presented for Norwegian explorers.\n\nThe Fram Museum is located on the Bygdoy peninsula, right next to the Norwegian Maritime Museum and the Kon-Tiki Museum.\n\nThe museum features multiple exhibits, a movie theater showing historical films, and a gift shop. The museum is accessible by the No. 30 bus or by taking the museum ferry during certain times of the year.\n\nBygdøynesveien 39, 0286 Oslo, Norway\n\nThe museum’s permanent collection features the Gjoa, the first ship to cross the Northwest Passage. It was manned by six men and completed the journey in 1906.\n\nToday, the museum houses a dedicated building that was once home to the Gjoa. In 2017, it became fully accessible to the public.\n\nThe Fram Museum features the world’s most famous polar ship, and displays a variety of artifacts from polar expeditions. Visitors can also watch informative films about polar exploration in the museum’s onsite cinema.\n\nOslo Cathedral #9\n\nThe Oslo Cathedral, formerly Our Savior’s Church, is the main church of the Church of Norway Diocese of Oslo. It is also the parish church for downtown Oslo.\n\nThe cathedral building dates from 1694–1697. The interior of the church is adorned with stained glass and mosaics. The church is open to the public and offers a variety of services, including mass.\n\nThe cathedral’s interior was refurnished in the 1950s to give it a more baroque look. The architect, Arnstein Arneberg, added many baroque items to the church.\n\nHe also brought back the altarpiece and pulpit from the Priest’s church in Majorstua. The cathedral also has large ceiling paintings by Hugo Lous Mohr.

    "Wang Yi Meets with Foreign Minister Anniken Huitfeldt of Norway": "On September 21, 2022 local time, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with Norwegian Foreign Minister Anniken Huitfeldt on the sidelines of the United Nations (UN) General Assembly in New York.\n\nWang Yi said, pragmatic cooperation between China and Norway has made positive progress in recent years. Last year, bilateral trade increased by nearly 40 percent year on year. Free trade agreement (FTA) negotiations have entered the final stage, and a new version on avoidance of double taxation will soon be signed. In the face of world changes and chaos, stability and confidence are more important than gold. The two sides should respect each other and treat each other as equals, increase understanding and eliminate misunderstanding, maintain the sound momentum of sound and stable development of China-Norway relations, strengthen exchanges at all levels, and promote pragmatic cooperation to achieve more results. China is ready to work with Norway to strengthen communication and coordination in the United Nations and other multilateral institutions and jointly practice true multilateralism.\n\nHuitfeldt said that the Norwegian side is pleased that the two sides have overcome the pandemic and continued to advance bilateral relations. Norway and China have great potential for cooperation in such areas as climate change response, economic transformation, renewable energy, and green development. Norway looks forward to speeding up FTA negotiations and continuing to conduct constructive cooperation with China.\n\nWang Yi expressed, China has played an important role in promoting the conclusion of the Paris Agreement. China will continue to show its responsibility as a major country and shoulder its due responsibility for the future of humanity. We stay committed to the path of green, low-carbon, and sustainable development, and have set two ambitious goals of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality to achieve the largest reduction in carbon emission intensity in the world. We vigorously develop renewable energy, with electricity generated by wind and solar power ranking the first worldwide, as well as the world's largest production and sales of new energy vehicles. Developed countries are expected to honor their commitments and provide financial, technological, and capacity-building support to developing countries.\n\nHuitfeldt said that Europe is deeply worried about the current situation in Ukraine and hopes that China will play an important role. Wang Yi expounded on the principled position of the Chinese government and stressed that what President Xi Jinping has proposed that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries must be respected, the purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be fully observed, the legitimate security concerns of all countries must be taken seriously, and all efforts that are conducive to the peaceful settlement of the crisis must be supported is the fundamental guide for China in dealing with the Ukraine issue. The international community should support all efforts conducive to peace, and cope with the challenges brought by the spillover of the crisis to world economic recovery. China will continue to play a constructive role in promoting peace talks in its own way.",

    "Norway open to gas price caps": "Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, left, with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres at the U.N. Gernal Assembly in New York | Craig Ruttle/Pool/EPA-EFE\n\nNEW YORK — Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre says his country is open to the previously unthinkable step of imposing price caps on gas to rein in Europe’s energy crisis.\n\nAs political leaders, activists and philanthropists piled on the pressure Wednesday to act to limit climate change at U.N. General Assembly events, Støre told POLITICO that “no solution should be off the table,\" when asked about a push by some European governments for gas price caps.\n\n\"No proposal, no idea\" is off limits, he said. \"We really have to work on this together.\"\n\nStøre sees Europe’s energy crisis as the key plank of what he called “Putin’s war on Europe. They have a military campaign in Ukraine, and they have an energy war in Europe.\"\n\nWhile many European governments support a price cap — including Italy, Poland Belgium, Greece and Sweden — some governments, like Germany, have concerns. With gas in short supply and high demand, some exporters may be tempted to send their gas to other parts of the world if the EU imposes a price cap.\n\nStøre himself is skeptical that a price cap would achieve its aims, “because the danger of doing that is that you may limit supply,” instead of nudging consumption down, he said. He prefers to soften the pain of high energy prices through “redistribution mechanisms,” such as tax credits or welfare payments.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez told POLITICO earlier this week that other radical policy options need to be considered. Sánchez thinks governments need to learn from COVID-19 pandemic responses and coordinate better. “Why don't we centralize gas purchases, as we did with the vaccines?” he said.\n\nNorway, a major fossil fuel exporter, is struggling to balance the effects of Russia’s war in Ukraine alongside the country’s commitment to go green.\n\n“These very high energy prices in Europe are not good for Norway,” Støre said. “These are our allies and partners. We are not served by their economies being rocked,” he added.\n\nWhile high prices drive up Norway’s tax revenues — oil and gas companies pay a 78 percent tax to the Norwegian treasury — they drive up domestic prices too. But Støre is undeterred when it comes to making Norway transition to green energy. “We need to scale up the energy transition,” he said.\n\nSánchez is backing Norway, telling fellow leaders not to get distracted by Russian President Vladimir Putin’s energy tactics: “We have a bigger crisis with climate change,” he told POLITICO.\n\nFor now, that transition is unaffordable in many parts of the world. A new Global Leadership Council, co-chaired by Støre and Rockefeller Foundation President Rajiv Shah, aims to change that.\n\n“Six billion people live in energy poverty, and as long as they are energy poor, that will be a major stumbling block for us moving forward on climate,” Støre said.\n\nThe council met for the first time Wednesday and is part of the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet. Its members include World Bank President David Malpass, International Energy Agency boss Fatih Birol, the heads of development banks and Bank of America’s Anne Finucane.\n\nOther groups in New York for the U.N. General Assembly are pushing to change the tone of climate debates, worried that climate action is increasingly becoming a victim of political polarization.\n\nHannah Jones, CEO of British Prince William's Earthshot Prize for environmental work, said this fear is a driving force behind the prince’s climate activism. “He felt really clearly that if we didn't bring urgent optimism into the conversation, we risk people shutting down on us, and not being able to move forward and not take action,\" Jones said.\n\nThe prince had planned to be in New York to announce the winners of the Earthshot Prize, but the trip was canceled due to the death of his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nFight over the future\n\nThe fraught nature of climate debates was on full display Tuesday.\n\nClimate activist and former U.S. Vice President Al Gore tore into Malpass, demanding his replacement as World Bank president for what Gore described as a lack of climate action at the bank.\n\nSpeaking onstage in New York, Malpass repeatedly declined to say he agreed with the scientific consensus that the planet’s climate is changing dangerously. “I’m not a scientist,” Malpass said.\n\nNon-state actors also launched a deluge of climate commitments Wednesday. Amazon and Water.org announced a partnership to provide access to safe water for 100 million people, while a coalition of large companies including Ikea and Unilever committed to taking their most polluting vehicles off the road, and transitioning toward zero-emissions vehicles by 2040.\n\nAntha Williams, head of Bloomberg Philanthropies, which hosted the Earthshot Innovation Summit Wednesday, said the world needs action at all levels to have any hope of sticking to the Paris climate agreement. “We need multilateral collaboration between nation states now more than ever, but they alone are not going to get it done,” she said.\n\nJones sees the process of identifying the local solutions from Earthshot Prize winners as an important step to change on a bigger scale. \"We are a global search engine. We scour the earth for incredible solutions with an eye to diversity and representation,\" Jones said.\n\nThe goal, she added, is “finding those solutions from the Global South by people that wouldn't be walking down Sand Hill Road [in Silicon Valley] and bumping into a venture capitalist.”\n\nU.N. Secretary-General António Guterres will push national leaders to make further commitments at an informal leaders roundtable on climate action.\n\nStøre offered fulsome praise to the climate efforts of U.S. President Joe Biden, including the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act. “I can only salute him,” Støre said.",
    "Norway and the Geopolitics of Battery Minerals – PRIO Blogs": "Batteries are as essential to the “green” energy transition as wind parks, solar power, and electric cars. These green energy technologies all require vast amounts of minerals. Norway has the potential to be an important new supplier of batteries, but it has been surprisingly silent on the issue – until now.\n\nFor some years, experts worldwide have pointed to a discrepancy between supply and demand in minerals critical for the ‘green’ energy transition. Commodities like lithium, graphite, cobalt, and nickel are essential to produce batteries. But the global Covid-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine have pointed to serious bottlenecks in the supply of these critical minerals.\n\nChina has dominated the battery supply chain and is expanding its control over the various steps in that chain, from mining to refining to manufacturing batteries in China and abroad. Mining is often concentrated in poorer countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where 70% of the world’s cobalt is sourced. Such concentration heightens the dependency of European industries on resource-rich countries. The war in Ukraine has further aggravated mineral and metal supply issues, as Russian nickel supplies are now largely off-limits to Western battery manufacturers. Mineral self-sufficiency in Europe seems like a pipe dream, given the few mining sources and refining projects that currently exist on the continent.\n\nArendal … is also one of three sites where large-scale battery cell production is planned.\n\nTo address this highly political and strategic issue, the European Union has been mapping supply chains in order to develop strategies to access these materials. And Norway has begun to address the issue of the geopolitics of critical mineral supply. At this year’s Arendalsuka, an annual political festival, the topic added some pepper to last year’s battery euphoria. The southern Norwegian town of Arendal not only hosts Norway’s democratic dance floor, as the festival often is called, it is also one of three sites where large-scale battery cell production is planned. With the aim to make Norway nothing less than a “green industrial and energy giant” through battery production and other “green” technologies, the Norwegian government launched its battery strategy in June 2022.\n\nHow does Norway approach the critical raw material challenge?\n\nThe Minister of Trade and Industry, Jan Christian Vestre, not only wants Norway to become a battery giant but also a sustainable mining nation. His ministry is currently developing a new mineral strategy which promises both more mining as well as recycling of minerals and metals. However, the few planned mining projects are contested. A “less visible” form of extraction proposed is seabed mining, spearheaded by the Petroleum Directorate. Internationally, though, this type of mining is highly disputed and not recommended by the EU.\n\nAs in many other European countries, establishing a robust mining sector in Norway will take time, is politically challenging due to its impacts, and would probably not satisfy the expected demand in time. Realistically, that leaves the Norwegian battery actors relying on raw materials from outside Europe for some time.\n\nIn a panel debate on critical raw materials at Arendalsuka, Parliamentarian and former Minister of Climate and Environment, Ola Elvestuen (V) acknowledged that the East-West polarisation will make cooperation on mineral and metal supplies unavoidable: “We will have to be more strategic in our partnerships with Africa, South America and Southeast Asia. That is an essential component in the biggest challenge we are in, to protect freedom and democracy and to reach our climate goals”.\n\nIt remains to be seen what role strategic partnerships will be given when Norway’s mineral strategy is launched later this year.

    "Indonesia and Norway give REDD+ deal another go after earlier breakup": "Indonesia and Norway have embarked on another REDD+ scheme that will see the latter pay the former to keep its forests standing, after a previous attempt failed because of lack of payment.\n\nIndonesia is home to the third-largest expanse of tropical rainforest in the world, and the bulk of its greenhouse gas emissions comes from land-use change, forest degradation, and deforestation.\n\nOfficials from both countries say it’s of mutual benefit to both countries, and to the world, to preserve Indonesia’s forests boost their capacity to sequester carbon from the atmosphere.\n\nUnder the new deal, payments still outstanding from the previous agreement, which was terminated in 2021, will be honored.\n\nJAKARTA — Indonesia has signed a new climate deal with Norway that will see the Nordic country pay the Southeast Asian one to keep its forests standing. The deal comes a year after Indonesia terminated a nearly identical scheme between the two countries over the lack of payments.\n\nLand-use change, forest degradation, and deforestation account for the bulk of Indonesia’s greenhouse gas emissions. The idea behind the new deal (and the previous one) is that by slowing or outright preventing forest loss, Indonesia will be able to preserve what’s currently the third-biggest expanse of tropical rainforest on Earth (behind the Amazon and the Congo Basin). Measurable progress on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, a mechanism known as REDD+, will then be eligible for payment under the deal with Norway.\n\nThe new partnership is enshrined in a memorandum of understanding signed by Indonesia’s minister of environment and forestry, Siti Nurbaya Bakar, and Norway’s minister of climate and environment, Espen Barth Eide, on Sept. 12.\n\nSiti said the intention to form a new partnership was conveyed by Norway in a letter dated Aug. 5.\n\n“Indonesia under the leadership of [President] Jokowi [Joko Widodo] has made great strides and I have to happily announce that we see Indonesia as a world leader on global issues that we’re discussing today,” Eide said. “It’s good for Indonesia, it’s good for Norway, it’s good for the planet because all of our efforts to reduce our emissions from energy, from the industry, from transport, would all be in vain if we don’t look after the carbon sink we already have.”\n\nRewarded for reducing emissions\n\nThe centerpiece of Indonesia’s forest policy is its “FOLU Net Sink 2030 Operational Plan,” an ambitious bid to transform its forests into a major carbon sink by 2030, absorbing 140 million metric tons more CO2 than they emit into the atmosphere.\n\nIndonesia has long been among the world’s top emitters of greenhouse gases from deforestation, forest fires and peatland destruction, but its deforestation rate has declined in recent years. According to official data, Indonesia’s deforestation rate in 2019/2020 was 115,500 hectares (285,400 acres), an almost 90% drop from 1.09 million hectares (2.69 million acres) in 2014/2015.\n\nThis progress came during the period when the previous agreement between Indonesia and Norway, signed in 2010, was still in place.\n\nIn 2019, Norway agreed to pay 530 million krone ($56 million) for Indonesia preventing the emission of 11.23 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) through REDD+ in 2017. But by 2021, Norway still hadn’t paid, prompting Indonesia to terminate the REDD+ agreement.\n\n“Indonesia and Norway had cooperation on environment, with REDD+ agreement in 2010, and it was very unfortunate [that] we cannot continue this cooperation,” Indonesia’s foreign minister, Retno Marsudi, said during a joint press conference with Norwegian officials in Jakarta on Sept. 12. “But we learned a lot from the REDD+ cooperation and continue to be constructive in our engagement.”\n\nBuilding on their long-standing partnership on environmental issues and past experiences, Norway and Indonesia have entered a new agreement, Eide said.\n\n“[We are] learning from our shared experience in the past and moving towards something that I think is really and genuinely promising,” he said at the press conference.\n\nBustar Maitar, CEO of Indonesian environmental NGO EcoNusa Foundation, said he’s optimistic the new climate partnership will further strengthen efforts to achieve the FOLU Net Sink target by 2030 and other climate actions.\n\nWhat to expect\n\nThe details of the new deal will be ironed out in a new contribution agreement, set to be signed in the next three to four weeks, Eide said.\n\n“And I would like to underline that this is just around the corner and that this is very promising work based on the MOU that we needed to sign in order to complete the contribution agreement,” he said.\n\nWhat’s clear, though, is that Norway’s International Climate and Forest Initiative (NICFI) will channel the payments directly to Indonesia’s Environment Fund. And the $56 million outstanding that Norway had agreed to pay Indonesia back in 2019 will be paid under the new partnership.\n\nEide said Norwegian payments for Indonesia’s REDD+ achievements made from 2016/2017 to 2019/2020 will be based on the existing measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) protocol, a system set up by Indonesia to account for its progress in reducing emissions.\n\nPayments for results generated from 2020/2021 onward will be based on a mutually agreed updated MRV protocol.\n\n“The first results-based contribution will amount to USD 56 million for verified emission reductions in the forest year” 2016/2017, or August 2016 through July 2017, Norway’s Ministry for Climate and Environment said in a press statement. “Additional results-based contributions will be [made] annually as emission reductions are verified for subsequent years.”\n\nThe new partnership differs in scope from the previous Indonesia-Norway REDD+ agreement, according to Indonesia’s environment minister Siti.\n\n“It is not just about the result-based contribution agreement, it encompasses a broader engagement on climate and forest issues in Indonesia,” she said at the press conference. “The MOU is also to emphasize the importance of deliverable, tangible and direct benefits for the community, and for the progress of Indonesia.”\n\nTo prevent this new deal from being abruptly terminated like the last one, it will be based on mutual respect and mutual understanding, complete with an MRV protocol that’s mutually agreed on by the two countries, said Dida Migfar Ridha, the head of foreign partnerships at Indonesia’s environment ministry.\n\n“This [partnership] is built together in accordance to Indonesia’s characteristics. For instance, we’re based on local community and Indigenous peoples, [and] we have internal regulations [on those issues],” he said on the sidelines of the press conference. “What’s most important is mutual trust and respect by paying attention to existing regulations, especially since [the new partnership] is carried out in Indonesia.”\n\nBanner image: Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae).

    "Norway must rely mostly on its allies": "NEWS ANALYSIS: As the leader of Norway’s neighbouring Russia shocked the world again, now with nuclear threats, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre readily concedes that his government must rely on the US and other NATO allies for any needed defense. They’ve all been gathered at the UN General Assembly in New York this week, but just before that, Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre was flown out to visit a US aircraft carrier at sea.\n\nThe carrier visit confirmed once again that the US and Norway are close allies and also that US forces will continue to maintain a strong presence in Norwegian territory, not least along its coast. “What gives Norway security is that we have allies who have capacity,” Støre told newspaper Aftenposten while standing on the deck of the USS Gerald R Ford on Monday.\n\nConcerns remain over Norway’s lack of capacity to defend itself, even after being invaded and enduring Nazi German occupation during World War II, sharing a border with the Soviet Union throughout the Cold War and, more recently, with Russia under an increasingly aggressive Vladimir Putin. The Russian president’s announcement that he’s mobilizing 300,000 more Russian troops to send to Ukraine sparked more outrage and condemnation, as did his claims that Russia’s nuclear weapons were “even more modern” than NATO’s. US President Joe Biden called Putin “shameless,” while NATO’s Norwegian secretary general Jens Stoltenberg referred to Putin’s “rhetoric” as both ruthless and dangerous.\n\nUkrainians, meanwhile, managed to defend their capital of Kyiv when Putin launched his assault in February, have fought hard to defend the entire country and most recently reclaimed territory in the east that Russia had been occupying. Many defense experts now claim Putin has suffered humiliating losses and is merely responding in a desperate manner. Others stress how Ukraine had both a civilian population and a military that were well-prepared for an invasion even before they started receiving military aid from NATO countries including Norway and many others.\n\n“An entire society stood together with a force that shocked the attackers,” Aftenposten wrote last week. Ukrainians kept food supplies, transport, telecommunications, banking services and social media going, along with delivery of electricity, water and heating. Russia was thus met by a “total defense,” and questions have risen over whether Norway could mount the same. Several researchers think not, even when crises loom.\n\nUkraine hadn’t been prepared when Putin first invaded Crimea in 2014 and then threatened Donbas farther north. Ukrainian defense had been neglected during its earlier regimes that were friendly with Russia and willing to bow to Putin. Tor Bukkvoll of Norway’s defense research institute FFI told Aftenposten that civilian Ukrainians’ long-standing lack of trust in government officials made them more self-sufficient: “They haven’t had any faith that the authorities will do anything to help the country move forward. They act themselves.”\n\nNorwegians, by contrast, have relatively strong confidence in their leaders but researchers think they need to extend their dugnad culture of sharing social responsibility to better prepare themselves for any military crisis. “The war is not far away,” FFI’s research director Janet Blatny told Aftenposten. “We shouldn’t just rely on defense capacity. We need a total defense, too.”\n\nProfessional defense needs improvement as well, according to the head of Norway’s officers’ union. Torbjørn Bongo told newspaper Dagsavisen last week that the military is struggling to hang on to educated and trained officers. Many are also retiring upon turning 60, and he fears a shortage of officers in the years to come.\n\nNorwegian Defense Minister Bjørn Arild Gram claimed in May that the government is strengthening civil defense at home. There’s been more emphasis on the need for national preparedness, from Norwegians getting lists of what to stock up on at home to implementation of anti-terror measures. More military exercises are being carried out within Norway and in NATO countries bordering on Russia, but FFI urges more resources for the health sector, fire and police departments and construction capacity to rebuild if necessary. The government is, meanwhile, funding a new defense commission charged with evaluating security- and defense policy and what should be prioritized to ensure both over the next 10- to 20 years.\n\nFFI views a war with Russia as highly improbable, but thinks Norway must expect more Russian aggression. Defense capacity, FFI researchers suggest, should thus be subjected to “stress tests,” as should the supply chains for energy, food, water, electronic communication, transport, banking and social services. Defense Chief Eirik Kristoffersen agrees: “The best thing each one of us can do is to be able to take care of ourselves and those closest to us. Everyone needs to think through what they can do in a difficult situation.”\n\nKristoffersen also told Norwegian Broadcasting (NRK) that there’s less Russian military activity along Norway’s border. “We’re seeing considerably less presence of ground troops on Kola (the peninsula where Russia’s main northern base at Murmansk is located) than we’ve ever marked, as least as long as I’ve been in the service (34 years).” Many of the troops based in the far north have been moved to Ukraine, and many Russian soldiers reportedly have been killed. Defense capacity at naval- and air bases on Kola appears stable, but “they don’t have any offensive capacity left,” according to Kristoffersen.\n\nPrime Minister Støre, meanwhile, was flown out to the US aircraft carrier from the huge US naval base in Norfolk, Virginia, just months after one of Norway’s frigates took part in support exercises for another US aircraft carrier, the USS Harry S Truman. Støre seemed proud that US Navy officials came with “genuine” praise of the Norwegian frigate’s contribution while actually under US command.\n\nWhen asked why he’d taken the time to visit the USS Gerald R Ford at the start of a hectic week in Washington DC and at the UN in New York, Støre told Aftenposten it was to see “the core of Norway’s security.” In return, Norway can offer its geographic position in the Arctic and be “NATO’s eyes and ears” regarding nearby Russian military activity. “It’s fine teamwork with our allies,” he added. “What gives Norway a sense of security is that we have allies who have the capacity.”\n\nNo one can expect a country of less than 6 million residents to have the funding capacity of nations like the US. Aftenposten noted that the USS Gerald R Ford alone cost the equivalent of everything Norway spends on defense over a two-year period. Asked whether he expects US aircraft carriers to sail more often in Norwegian waters, Støre replied “yes,” adding how the base at Norfolk and its fleet is responsible for the Atlantic region.\n\nNorway, to its credit, has invested in eight new surveillance aircraft (built in the US) and their crews are trained in Florida. Støre told Aftenposten that much of the US’ own military planning is based on information that Norway has contributed. Defense Minister Gram added that while Norway “is a small country, it contributes strongly to the NATO alliance through intelligence gathering, new fighter jets, the new surveillance aircraft and special forces. Gram also said that the US had been wanting to devote more of its military attention to Asia, “but I think the last nine months have reminded us all about the importance of the trans-Atlantic relationship.”\n\nAfter Støre’s flight out to the aircraft carrier, he continued on to Washington DC, where he met with both the Republicans’ leader in the senate, Mitch McConnell, and with the Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. Most of their talks, according to the prime minister’s office, centered on the war in Ukraine.\n\n“We also talked about how Europe will get through the winter with an energy crisis the likes of which we haven’t seen before,” Støre told Norwegian Broadcasting (NRK). “We have faith Europe will manage because we all must cooperate.”\n\nStøre stated that he also thanked Pelosi and McConnell “for their important support.” McConnell, meanwhile, told NRK he was glad Støre visited, that the US appreciated the lengthy “cooperation we have in NATO” and that he’s glad Sweden and Finland are joining NATO, “so we’re all on the same side. But in my opinion, the most important thing in the world now is to beat the Russians in Ukraine.”\n\nThen it was on to New York for the UN General Assembly, at which came news of Putin’s televised speech in Russia and his escalation of the war on Ukraine. Støre called it “extremely serious,” adding that it “will lead to more suffering for both Ukrainians and Russians. I repeat our strong urging to Russia to end this war. Ukraine has Norway’s full support.”\n\nNorwegian Foreign Minister Anniken Huitfeldt said Norway would do what it could so that Putin will not succeed with his war either on Ukraine or on European energy supplies. “Putin has a goal of creating political division and an economic downturn in Europe,” Huitfeldt told Norwegian Broadcasting (NRK). “He will not succeed with that.”\n\nMore demonstrations against Russia, Putin and his war on Ukraine were set to take place in both Oslo and Norway’s northern city of Kirkenes, located closest to the Russian border, as the news from Moscow worsened.\n\n“We don’t know when a crisis is coming, but we know that it will come,” FFI’s Blatny told Aftenposten, pointing to lessons from the pandemic. “We need to plan for that.”\n\nNewsinEnglish.no/Nina Berglund",

Furthermore, they have now won eight of their last 12 matches.\n\nHaving already accumulated four more points than in their previous Nations League campaign, when they only avoided relegation on goal difference, adding three more in Norway would take them into the continent's elite next time around.\n\nAfter finishing above Portugal to dramatically clinch automatic World Cup qualification - secured through Mitrovic's 90th-minute winner on the final day - the Serbs also have one eye on the looming global finals, so Stojkovic's squad will be keen to impress and secure seats on the plane to Qatar.\n\nNorway Nations League form:\n\nNorway form (all competitions):\n\n\n\n\n\nSerbia Nations League form:\n\nSerbia form (all competitions):\n\nTeam News\n\n© Reuters\n\nHaving generally settled on a 4-3-3 setup in recent months, Norway coach Stale Solbakken must decide whether to stick or twist on the final day, with just one point enough to beat their opponents to top spot.\n\nIn any case, the personnel which started the loss to Slovenia should not change too much, with Martin Odegaard skippering the side after overcoming a calf problem which kept him out of Arsenal's most recent game. Erling Haaland leads the line up front, having netted his sixth goal in five Nations League matches on Saturday - Norway have scored seven in all.\n\nAt least one switch will be made in midfield, though, as Kristian Thorstvedt must serve a one-match ban due to accumulated bookings; Morten Thorsby is his most likely replacement.\n\nWhile the hosts have a fearsome forward to worry the Serbian defence, the visitors' front line will be led by vice-captain Aleksandar Mitrovic, who has racked up 49 goals in 75 international appearances following his treble at the weekend.\n\nInfluential midfielder Sergej Milinkovic-Savic will be sidelined, though, after picking up another yellow card against Sweden, which may see Sampdoria's Filip Djuricic or Ivan Ilic of Verona drafted into the side that starts in Oslo.\n\nNikola Milenkovic is absent from the back three due to injury, so Serbia's defence will be lacking a little experience - two of the trio that lined up on Saturday have just three senior caps between them.\n\nIt appears that Dragan Stojkovic has now settled on a regular goalkeeper, and Sergej's younger brother Vanja Milinkovic-Savic should pip Sevilla's Marko Dmitrovic to feature as the Eagles' last line of defence.\n\nNorway possible starting lineup:\n\nNyland; Ryerson, Hanche-Olsen, Ostigard, Meling; Odegaard, Berge, Thorsby; Elyounoussi, Haaland, Sorloth\n\nSerbia possible starting lineup:\n\nV. Milinkovic-Savic; Babic, S. Mitrovic, Masovic; Lazovic, Lukic, Ilic, Kostic; Djuricic, Tadic; A. Mitrovic\n\nWe say: Norway 1-2 Serbia\n\nWhile Norway are reliant on one man to fire them to success, Serbia's all-round attacking riches mean that they can even win when their backs are against the wall.

    "Norway 'skeptical' about European gas price cap, but retains open attitude: PM": "Oslo agrees to 'even closer' dialogue with the EU\n\nNorway is \"skeptical\" about the impact that an EU gas price cap would have on tackling the energy crisis given the shortage of gas in Europe, its Prime Minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, said Sept. 12.\n\nNot registered? Receive daily email alerts, subscriber notes & personalize your experience. Register Now\n\nStøre held talks Sept. 12 with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen about the energy crisis in Europe, in which gas prices have hit record highs.\n\nPlatts assessed the Dutch TTF month-ahead price at a record-high Eur319.98/MWh Aug. 26, according to S&P Global Commodity Insights data. It was last assessed at Eur205.70/MWh Sept. 9.\n\nIt was the second time Støre and von der Leyen had spoken by telephone in less than a week.\n\nThe new talks came after EU energy ministers Sept. 9 agreed to give the EC a mandate to detail proposals on gas and power market intervention, including a gas price cap.\n\nStøre said he agreed with von der Leyen to have \"an even closer dialogue\" with the EU in the future on the various proposals that were now on the table.\n\n\"We enter the talks with an open attitude, but are skeptical about a maximum price for gas,\" Støre said. \"A maximum price will not do anything about the fundamental problem, namely that there is too little gas in Europe.\"\n\nStøre and von der Leyen had already talked Sept. 7 about the EC's proposals for measures to deal with the energy situation in Europe.\n\nThere have also been calls for Norway to consider offering European buyers a discount on their gas payments to help alleviate the crisis.\n\nIncreased gas supply\n\nNorway, however, has already increased its gas supplies to Europe this year through changes to field production permits and the diversion of gas normally used for re-injection for export.\n\nNorwegian pipeline gas exports to Continental Europe and the UK have been at the top of the five-year range since February amid record prices, according to Platts Analytics data.\n\nPipeline gas exports totaled 76.1 Bcm from January through August, up more than 6 Bcm year on year, the data showed.\n\nIn May, Norway raised its estimate for gas production this year by 6% to 122 Bcm as high prices provide an incentive for increased gas output across the Norwegian Continental Shelf.\n\n\"From the outset, Norway has done what we can to alleviate the situation in Europe, and Norwegian companies have significantly increased their production of gas,\" Støre said Sept. 12.\n\n\"Norway is now delivering 8% more gas to Europe than we did when the war broke out,\" he said.\n\nStøre said it was important to have a close dialogue with its partners and allies in Europe on the various solutions to the situation that had arisen as a result of Russia's war against Ukraine.\n\nHe said both Norway and the EU benefitted from a \"more stable energy market.\"\n\nStøre and von der Leyen also discussed the role of long-term contracts in ensuring more stability in the market, with Støre emphasizing that it was companies that entered into such long-term contracts.\n\nIn their previous conversation Sept. 7, Støre said it was important not to introduce measures that had \"unintended consequences\" and—in the worst-case scenario—could make matters worse in the longer term.\n\n\"Predictability and a long-term perspective will be an advantage for both gas producers and customers in Europe. This will ensure that Europe will continue to have enough energy in the future,\" he said.",
    "A Trip to Norway’s Storfjorden Region": "Norway’s Storfjorden region is home to picturesque fjords and scenic hikes. One visitor also found an extraordinary place to stay for a working vacation.\n\nNorwegians are fond of saying: “There’s no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothes”. The same goes for accommodation.\n\nIdeal location for a working vacation. Photo: Thomas Hornall.\n\nDuring a weekend getaway to Storfjorden in May, the rain fell in great sideways sheets, killing any hopes my partner and I had of long hikes.\n\nAfter months working in a Glasgow office, I dreaded being stuck inside. But even with dark-sky downpours, we spent the day safely cocooned in one of four glass-walled cabins, nestled between towering mountains.\n\nAn extraordinary escape\n\nWe stayed at Kilsti Compact Lodge, near the town of Eidsdal in the north west Sunnmøre region. It was recently featured on Channel 4’s Extraordinary Escapes in the UK.\n\nThe resort enjoys awe-inspiring panoramic views over the Storfjord and into the World Heritage Tafjord. I felt my clenched-fist mind relaxing rapidly with the dramatic beauty of the landscape.\n\nTafjord in Norway.\n\nDespite the rain – which would typically ruin my trip – we loved sitting inside our oasis reading, chatting, listening to music and watching the granite showers sweep by the fog-shrouded peaks.\n\nEven with unlucky weather, the little comforts here still made our trip well worthwhile.\n\nThey included a glass-windowed sauna (I came out a new man), a kitchenette, Wi-Fi, Hästens horsehair double beds, a glass panel in the bedroom roof for stargazing and a great outdoor area including a fire pit for grilling.\n\nKilsti Compact Lodge near Eidsdal. Photo: Thomas Hornall.\n\nAnother little detail I loved is the darkened glass in the wetroom, allowing you to enjoy the stunning view while showering without being seen from the outside.\n\nUnfortunately, it was too wet and unpredictable to go rafting in the valley of Valdallen, or complete one of the many hikes in the local area.\n\nA detour to Geiranger\n\nInstead, we drove around half an hour to the World Heritage site Geirangerfjord, widely considered Norway’s “jewel in the crown”.\n\nGeiranger and the Geirangerfjord. Photo: David Nikel.\n\nOne of the country’s most famous images, it stretches more than 20km and is surrounded by mountain peaks and steep cliff faces, all cut through by gushing waterfalls, including the “Seven Sisters”.\n\nThe town of Geiranger itself is charming and busy with sightseers. The chocolate factory was a real highlight. The caffe mocha, made before you with chocolate drops, is the best I’ve had.\n\nChocolate shop and factory in Geiranger, Norway. Photo: Thomas Hornall.\n\nIn August, we were back in Norway with several days of good weather ahead – so we had to return to Kilsti.\n\nSecond time lucky for hiking\n\nUsed to being jolted awake by an alarm, the first morning we rose gradually with an amber-red sunrise lighting the room through the roof pane and glass walls.\n\nThen we set off on a morning hike, up to the Kilstivatnet lake, where the water is clearer than glass, then on to the summit of Blåhornet (around 650m).\n\nRead more: The Norwegian Fjords\n\nThe gradual ascent is rewarded with excellent views over Norddalsfjorden, while groups of goats wander here and there by the side of the trail.\n\nBlueberries also grow all around here if you get hungry, and the lake is perfect for a bracing dip after a sweaty hike.\n\nI had to complete several work assignments on our two-day stay, but I couldn’t have asked for a better spot.\n\nKilsti Compact Lodge near Eidsdal. Photo: Thomas Hornall.\n\nThe cabin living area is roomy and comfortable with a table as a makeshift desk, while the sliding doors are perfect to let in some immaculate mountain air if it gets a bit warm. I also found the backdrop excellent for sparking creativity.\n\nWhen it gets snowy, by all accounts there’s still plenty to do here, including freeride powder skiing, cross-country skiing, and even guided snowshoe walks.\n\nLike everything in Norway, it’s not exactly cheap, but a nights’ stay for two comes in around $300-350 per night (up to $390 in the high season of June-Aug) which I found reasonable enough.\n\nMy cluttered mind underwent the mental equivalent of a Marie Kondo clean-up, everything put back into its rightful place through the natural beauty of this area.\n\nElsewhere in the Storfjord region\n\nOne of Norway’s best-known scenic drives, the snaking mountain road Trollstigen (The Troll’s Path), is around an hours’ drive north.\n\nIt’s also around a 30km drive to the Tafjord, the site of a devastating tsunami in 1934.\n\nFirst up on my next visit to the region will be a drive on the Atlantic Road, an engineering marvel dubbed “the world’s most beautiful drive”, which takes you right out to the ocean’s edge.",
    "Norway to Close Its Embassies in Slovakia, Sri Lanka & Kosovo in 2023": "The Norwegian government has announced that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will close five foreign stations next year, including three embassies, one embassy office and one consulate general\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThrough a statement issued on September 9, the government emphasised that the Ministry will increase staff in some foreign missions in 2023, especially in Europe, in order to deal with the workload, SchengenVisaInfo.com reports.\n\nIn this regard, the embassies that will be closed in 2023 are the ones in Bratislava (Slovakia), Colombo (Sri Lanka) and Pristina (Kosovo). At the same time, the embassy office in Antananarivo (Madagascar) and the consulate general in Houston (USA) will also be closed next year.\n\n“Norway’s diplomatic presence in Kosovo, Madagascar, Slovakia and Sri Lanka will be handled in a different way, for example, from a nearby Norwegian embassy, ​​or by appointing a home-based ambassador for the individual country,” the statement reads.\n\nNorway currently has 101 foreign missions abroad, including the ones that are set to be closed. However, with these changes, Norway will have fewer foreign missions but roughly the same number of diplomats posted as now.\n\n“The Norwegian Foreign Service consists of more than 2,600 employees, of which around 800 in Oslo, more than 600 posted diplomats, and approximately 1,200 local employees who are employed directly by the foreign missions,” the statement explains.\n\nAccording to the government, Embassies like the one in Bucharest, Kyiv and Vilnius, together with the EU delegation and the NATO delegation in Brussels, will be strengthened with more Norwegian diplomats in 2023. Thus, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is considering further reinforcements with diplomats or staff employed locally in other countries’ foreign missions in the EU.\n\nCommenting on these changes, Foreign Minister Anniken Huitfeldt added that the EU has contributed to European unity and strengthened cooperation for security and defence after the outbreak of the war in Ukraine. He emphasised that this is how Norway will strengthen its diplomatic efforts in the EU, NATO and selected EU countries.\n\nIn addition, Norway will also strengthen selected stations outside Europe with expatriate personnel in 2023. Meanwhile, more local employees will be in selected foreign stations inside and outside Europe.\n\nAs the government explains, the increase in diplomats and local employees in some foreign missions is mainly related to the government’s objective to increase Norwegian exports.\n\nThe Minister of Foreign Affairs also said that a lot is happening in the EU related to the green transition and digitisation, which offers great opportunities for Norwegian industry and business.",
    "‘Selfish’ Norway accused of Ukraine war-profiteering": "Hansson, a former leader of the Norwegian Green Party, isn’t buying the government’s argument | Hakon Mosvold Larsen/AFP via Getty Images\n\nPress play to listen to this article Voiced by Amazon Polly\n\nOSLO — Norwegian opposition party lawmaker Rasmus Hansson has a harsh message for his country’s government: The war in Ukraine isn’t a fair reason to demand higher gas prices.\n\nSanctions-hit Russia is weaponizing gas deliveries, hoping to hurt Ukraine's EU allies now scrambling to cut their reliance on Russian energy exports. That's sending the price of natural gas soaring — up sevenfold over the last year.\n\nNow Norway has supplanted Russia as the EU's largest source of gas, and torrents of cash are pouring into the country.\n\nOslo expects around €94 billion in net income from its petroleum industry this year, a rise of around €65 billion from last year. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, which manages the country's petroleum earnings, has a current value of around €1.2 trillion, or around €250,000 per citizen.\n\nThat flood of money is turning into both a domestic and a foreign political problem.\n\nThe Nordic state’s center-left government — made up of the Social Democrats and Center Party — says it has shown solidarity with a 1.4 billion cubic meter production hike at three key fields in March, which is sending more gas to the EU. It argues Norway shouldn’t be blamed for market forces beyond its control.\n\nBut Hansson, a former leader of the Norwegian Green Party, isn’t buying the government’s argument.\n\nHe called it “morally wrong” to profit from price rises driven primarily by war and argued that Norway also risks damaging relations with key European trading partners by forcing them to pay such high gas prices.\n\nToo much money?\n\n“We think Norway is being short-sighted and too selfish,” Hansson said in an interview in his office overlooking the parliament in the capital Oslo. “We are getting a windfall profit which is very big, but the question is does that money belong to us as long as the most obvious reason for that price increase and that extra income is the disaster that has befallen the Ukrainian people?”\n\nHansson wants to see the extra money go into a solidarity fund that would be used to rebuild Ukraine after the war. He said experts should set what should be considered a “normal” gas price and everything above that should be seen as war profits and given away.\n\nBrussels has a similar idea. During an emergency summit of EU energy ministers last week, several countries called for setting a price cap on all gas coming into the EU; the European Commission wants such a measure directed only against Russia.\n\nOn Wednesday, Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen said she was discussing a “task force” with Norway to look at “how are we able to lower, in a reasonable manner, the price of gas.”\n\nSo far Norway isn't biting. Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre has repeatedly said he would not back a price cap on gas exports.\n\nHansson is also finding it difficult to get much traction for his idea in the Norwegian parliament, where his party, which only holds three of 169 seats, has met resistance from both the government and other opposition parties.\n\nCommission President Ursula Von der Leyen said she was discussing a “task force” with Norway to look at “how are we able to lower, in a reasonable manner, the price of gas.” | Monasse/Getty Images\n\nBut in other corners of Europe his argument is beginning to resonate.\n\nNorway should share the “gigantic” profits it has made as a result of higher oil and gas prices, especially with Ukraine, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said earlier this year.\n\nTeresa Ribera, Spain’s minister for ecological transition, recently called the prices being paid to Norway for gas “disturbing.”\n\nIn written comments to POLITICO, Norwegian Foreign Minister Anniken Huitfeldt said Europe is facing a supply crisis, and Norway’s primary duty is to pump more gas.\n\n“Norway has been asked by the EU and our European partners to step up its production to cover as much of the shortfall from Russia as we can and we have done our utmost to do so,” Huidfeldt said.\n\nShe said Russia has deliberately distorted gas prices by shutting off supplies to Europe and was seeking to harm European consumers as part of its war against Ukraine. Norway and its European customers have a shared interest in “normalizing the prices and ending the distortion of the energy market,” she said.\n\nHuidfeldt said there were “many suggestions under discussion” but declined to say what those ideas were or which she favored.\n\n“I’m hesitant to go into specific proposals at this time,” Huidfeldt said. “One should carefully evaluate the implications of different measures so that the result is not a reduction of supply or less focus on energy savings.”\n\nMerry Norwegians\n\nSo far neither the cash influx nor the increase in gas prices seems to be worrying many Norwegians.\n\nThe government will allocate about €1 billion for a scheme that pays 90 percent of household electricity bills when wholesale prices rise above prescribed levels.\n\nMeanwhile, the wider economic outlook also appears comparatively benign, with unemployment around 3 percent and house prices still ticking up despite higher interest rates.\n\nOn the streets of Oslo, war and Europe’s energy crisis seem a long way away.\n\nLast week, near the city’s new €225 million museum housing the works of Edvard Munch, bathers enjoyed the last of the summer heat on an artificial beach.\n\nIn a nearby park close to parliament, Penny Heymans, a 76-year-old pensioner, handed out anti-war leaflets for a group called Grandmothers for Peace.\n\nShe said she was struggling to get much attention from passersby and she noted that Norwegians seemed happy to accept the gas price windfall and not question the deteriorating regional security picture behind it.\n\n“People are not really that engaged in what’s going on,” she said. “They feel like they are doing fine so why bother rocking the boat.”\n\nHansson, for one, is bothered that Norwegians seem unwilling to question their own good fortune.\n\n“It’s probably not good for people to be too rich,” he said. “They start to think they have a God-given right to stay that way.”",

Here is everything you need to know about SkyShowtime.\n\nWith cable services and multiple streaming options, TV in Norway is a pretty complicated environment these days. It’s about to get even more so with the launch of yet another streaming service.\n\nSkyShowtime, the European joint venture of Comcast’s Sky and Paramount Global, will launch in Norway on 20 September as part of a Nordic-wide rollout.\n\nIt follows approval from European regulators earlier this year. Following the Nordic launch, the service will launch in the Netherlands, Iberia, and Central & Eastern Europe.\n\nWhat’s on SkyShowtime?\n\nOf course, the first question everyone wants to know when a new streaming service launches is what’s on it?\n\nTV\n\nIn Norway, SkyShowtime replaces Paramount+, just as HBO Max replaced HBO Nordic. This means existing Paramount+ viewers won’t lose access to existing shows, including Halo, Yellowstone, The Offer and Star Trek: Strange New Worlds.\n\nShowtime originals coming to the service include Yellowjackets, Dexter: New Blood, Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber and The First Lady. Series premieres will include Showtime drama American Gigolo, Sky originals The Rising, The Fear Index, The Midwich Cuckoos, plus Law & Order season 21 from Peacock.\n\nIn a press release, the partners stated that “new premium scripted series, kids and family content and a selection of iconic library titles and box sets from Universal Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Nickelodeon, DreamWorks Animation, Paramount+, Showtime, Sky Studios and Peacock” will be available.\n\nThey also stated that “local original programming, documentaries and specials from its markets” will be available. Hoewver, there’s no information if or when any Norwegian language content will be available.\n\nMovies\n\nSkyShowtime will also feature TV premieres of theatrical films from Paramount Pictures and Universal Pictures, Hollywood’s two oldest studios.\n\nFollowing their theatrical and home entertainment releases, SkyShowtime will feature Top Gun: Maverick, Jurassic World Dominion, Minions: The Rise of Gru, Sing 2, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, The Lost City, Downton Abbey: A New Era, Nope and Belfast.\n\nHow can I get SkyShowtime?\n\nSkyShowtime will be a direct-to-consumer service available on Apple devices across Apple iOS and tvOS.

Exact details on how this will work remains to be seen, but it’s likely to work in a similar way to the recent launch of Britbox.\n\nIf you get a cable service via Telenor or Telia, you should hear details in due course.

    "Why We Moved To Norway When We Had Children": "Why We Moved To Norway When We Had Children\n\nThe story of why one Norwegian-Canadian couple chose to move back to Norway to raise their children.\n\nWe lived in Toronto for several years, but when I was pregnant with my second child my Canadian husband and I decided to move to Norway. I am sorry, Canada – you put too much emphasis on work. And it was time to leave.\n\nIt had nothing to do with safety, opportunities, health care, or standard of living; all of which is excellent in Canada. I am speaking of the “family first” approach which is essential to all Scandinavian countries, and part of the Nordic model.\n\nIn addition to people having a higher quality of life; it most likely has positive effects on gender equality, employment rates, fertility rates; and paradoxically, productivity. And yes – there are challenges too.\n\nParental leave\n\nNorway is ranked as the #4 country in the world for parental leave. Parents have a total of 49 weeks with 100% wage coverage or 59 weeks with 80% pay.\n\nThe benefits of leave for fathers\n\nWhen my family is visiting from abroad, they are surprised to see groups of fathers with strollers walking around during work hours.\n\nFathers have 16 weeks minimum paternity leave, and bond with their children very early; they have no choice. How this affects future generations is yet to be seen, but this special connection may even have positive effects on mental health.\n\nIf we were to continue to live in Canada, my husband would probably work long hours and I would take more care of the children. He would not have the opportunity to create the same bond with them.\n\nSick days for children\n\nThe Norwegian Government is very generous when it comes to granting leave when our children are sick.\n\nThere are always some who take advantage, but my experience as a HR-manager is parents with young children are extremely efficient. Giving them benefits increases loyalty, which makes them work even harder.\n\nAlso, society steps in 100% when children are seriously ill, or even dying. Knowing we don’t have to worry about work in such situations makes us feel safer, which is beneficial to general health. I am always certain all of this is a profitable project.\n\nCheap daycare\n\nParents in Norway spend 8% of average income on daycare, compared with 37,3% in New Zealand, 35,7% in the UK, and 33,3% in the US. The government also subsidizes private daycare and prices are more or less the same everywhere.\n\nGeneral acceptance of children\n\nWhen we first moved to Norway, my Canadian husband was amazed to see that it is commonplace to see colleagues and clients bring their kids to the office, take a child to the dentist during work hours, or leave at 4pm every day because the after-school program is closing.\n\nChildren playing in an Oslo fountain. Photo: Alisa24 / Shutterstock.com.\n\nMy impression is that children in Norway are less supervised and have more autonomy than in most countries. This is most likely due to overall safety.\n\nNorway’s societal trust is also very high. A common sight is strollers lined up outside the café while parents sit inside drinking coffee, watching with a casual eye. I don’t think it is even legal in some countries.\n\nThere is general acceptance of nursing anywhere. Even The Storting’s administration is looking into if the delegates are allowed to nurse inside the Parliamentary Hall.\n\nGender equality\n\nNorway is ranked #3 on The Global Gender Gap Index, while Canada is #25, and US #23, ranked after countries like Nicaragua and Rwanda. According to Statistics Norway, there has been an increase in female leadership. In 2019, 37% of all leaders were women.\n\nMy prediction is that if Norway continues to keep today’s approach to parental leave (this depends on the political situation), gender equality will increase even more.\n\nChildren walking in Vigeland Park, Oslo. Photo: Tumar / Shutterstock.com.\n\nBy the way, my Canadian mother-in-law still thinks mothers should stay at home to raise children, but she is particularly old fashioned.\n\nDoes it affect productivity?\n\nYou would think we are less efficient? Not true. Norwegians work on average 38 hours per week, and Norway is one of the most productive countries in the world.\n\nWe are extremely efficient and task oriented. Working long hours is highly overrated and I am not at all surprised we are ranked top.\n\nWe also have integrated systems and very little bureaucracy. If you change your address, all IT systems update automatically including your banking and work systems.\n\nI haven’t lived in Canada in 10 years, yet for some reason my Canadian in-laws still receive an annual letter from the Ministry of Health reminding me to have a mammogram. Clearly they didn’t get the memo that I left a decade ago. This kind of systemic inefficiency would never happen in Norway.\n\nThere are downsides\n\nYes, taxes are high, but not as high as you would think. Income tax is around the European average. However, sales tax in Norway is high.\n\nThe main downside for employers is they spend more time hiring and training, and the predictability is reduced. For society, it is problematic when the population is aging. We need more people working and not receiving benefits.\n\nHowever, none of these downsides were enough to tip the balance for us. Norway’s policies and general societal attitude to children means there is no better place for us right now.",
    "Norway’s Response to Death of Queen Elizabeth II": "The King of Norway and leading Norwegian politicians are among those to pay tribute to Queen Elizabeth II following the death of the British monarch. The British Embassy in Oslo has opened a book of condolence.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II, the UK's longest-serving monarch, has died aged 96. She passed away this afternoon at Balmoral Castle after reigning for 70 years. The news was announced by the BBC.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II pictured in 2007. Photo: Alessia Pierdomenico / Shutterstock.com.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II shared close ties with Norway. Her first foreign visit after becoming Queen was to Norway in 1955. There are also close family ties between the British and Scandinavian Royals.\n\nThere are more than 10,000 British citizens living and working in Norway.

    "Pulpit Rock: How To Get To Preikestolen In Norway": "Norway's iconic Preikestolen hike is one of the most popular day trips from Stavanger, especially among international visitors. Here are your options for how to get to Pulpit Rock.\n\nHiking the mountains and fjords of Norway has long attracted people from across the world to Scandinavia. Fuelled by photos shared on social media, Pulpit Rock is somewhere that has achieved new levels of popularity over the last two decades.\n\nIt's absolutely one of the most popular day trips from Stavanger. While you can't describe the Preikestolen hike as easy, it's far from extreme and also much shorter than many of Norway's other most famous hikes at about 3 hours roundtrip.\n\nThis makes it an extremely attractive travel destination for those visiting Stavanger and the fjord Norway region.\n\nTo make the most of your time, planning how to get from Stavanger to the Preikestolen trailhead is something that should be done in advance. Several tour operators run bus trips to Pulpit Rock, or you can make your own way there.\n\nBefore I go on, I'll just briefly mention the name. The Norwegian name for the clifftop is Preikestolen but the English name Pulpit Rock is just as commonly used by tour guides and the travel industry. We'll refer to both in this article.\n\nWhere is Pulpit Rock?\n\nAlthough often listed as one of the best things to do in Stavanger, Preikestolen is actually quite some distance away.\n\nThe clifftop overlooks the Lysefjord to the east of Stavanger. By car, the trailhead is about 39km from downtown Stavanger, so getting there needs some thought.\n\nOf course, a Preikestolen hike doesn't have to be a day trip. It's also possible to stay near the trailhead in lodges, cabins or campsites, or by wild camping in the surrounding areas.\n\nHow to get from Stavanger to Pulpit Rock\n\nI'm going to assume that most people planning the hike are going to be basing themselves in Stavanger. With lots of other things to do such as exploring the picturesque old town, Stavanger is a great choice as a base.\n\nWhen researching this trip, you may find some out of date information that talks of complicated journeys involving a ferry.\n\nWhile the ferry between Stavanger and Tau does still run, the journey to Preikestolen no longer requires it. Since its opening in December 2019, the 14.4km-long subsea Ryfylke Tunnel has made getting to the trailhead from Stavanger easier than ever.\n\nPreikestolen by car\n\nIf you have a car, driving to the trailhead is now easy and ferry-free via the Ryfylke tunnel. It should take about 40 minutes to complete the 38km journey. Bear in mind there is quite a hefty toll payment for the tunnel.\n\nPreikestolen Fjellstue and the parking lot at the Pulpit Rock trailhead.\n\nLeave Stavanger by crossing the Stavanger City Bridge on route 13 towards the north. You'll soon come to the Ryfylke Tunnel. Once through the tunnel, keep driving through Jørpeland and watch for the left turn on to the signed road up to the Preikestolen trailhead.\n\nParking can be an issue at high season, so plan to arrive early. There are 1,000 spaces managed by the Preikestolen 365 Foundation, together with 20 electric charging stations.\n\nAccording to the Foundation, “on the busiest days, the parking areas fill up and can be temporarily closed in the middle of the day.”\n\nParking costs NOK 250 for the day for cars, while electric car charging also comes with a fee. If you are staying at some of the trailhead accommodation, they may offer free parking.\n\nPreikestolen by bus tour\n\nAt least two companies run bus tours to Preikestolen from Stavanger. While they may seem expensive, such tours can be more convenient than driving and do offer value when you consider all road tolls and parking fees.\n\nNote that these trips are not guided hikes. They are bus transport to the trailhead only. Transport must be booked online in advance.\n\nSign on the trail to Pulpit Rock.\n\nThe best known bus transport is offered by Go Fjords. They offer departures from central Stavanger at 8am, with a matching return departure from the Preikestolen trailhead at 2pm. There is also a 10am/4pm departure.\n\nPulpit Rock Tours offer more departures and a more flexible return system. This is an option worth considering if you are planning an overnight stay.\n\nPreikestolen by public bus\n\nIf you are on a budget, there is a public bus that gets you most of the way to Preikestolen. Part of public transport in Stavanger, bus 100 operated by Kolombus runs throughout the day from central Stavanger to Jørpelandsvågen in Jørpeland.\n\nFrom Jørpeland, you would need to walk 8km (with a substantial uphill stretch) to Basecamp or take a taxi. The cost of a taxi will likely negate any savings you made by taking the public bus.\n\nOf course, you could thumb a lift from others heading to Pulpit Rock, but you do this at your own risk.\n\nStaying overnight at Pulpit Rock\n\nIf you are on a bus tour or drive yourself mid-morning from Stavanger, you're going to find the trail busy. Many keen hikers choose to camp close to the trailhead or along the trail itself in order to get the best possible experience in the morning or evening.\n\nAlso known as Basecamp, Preikestolen Fjellstue is the best-known accommodation at the trailhead. The striking architecture of the mountain lodge is an attractive place to stay the night before an early hike, or the night after an evening hike.\n\nAccommodation is basic yet fitted to a high standard. You can rent equipment such as hiking jackets, boots, poles and snow shoes should you forget to bring anything, or should weather conditions not be as your expected. Parking is free for guests.\n\nOther accommodation close to the trailhead includes Hikers' Camp, which is managed by Basecamp and offers 24 wooden tents. Mattresses are provided but guests must bring their own sleeping bags.\n\nThere's also some accommodation farther away in Jørpeland. About 4km away from the trailhead, Preikestolen Camping offers year-round space for pitching your tent or parking your campervan, caravan or RV."
