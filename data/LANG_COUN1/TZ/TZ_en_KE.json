    "Why US tech billionaire took up job as ambassador to Kenya": "By Mike Owuor More by this Author\n\nBy Elvis Ondieki More by this Author\n\nWhen United States President Joe Biden announced the nomination of Margaret “Meg” Whitman as the Ambassador to Kenya last December, one question must have lingered in many minds across the world: why would a Silicon Valley billionaire with a storied career as a corporate executive and board member of some of the world’s top multinationals take up this role?\n\nIt was an inevitable introductory question as the Sunday Nation team settled down for an exclusive interview with Ms Whitman—the first since her arrival last month—at the American embassy in Nairobi.\n\nPerhaps undergirded by decades of experience as a corporate leader and awareness of her new role as a diplomat, 66-year-old Ms Whitman calmly tackles even the most uncomfortable of questions and has a vivid recollection of events, people and places. She speaks with authority and dresses the part.\n\nHer real-time net worth on Forbes is indicated as $3.1 billion (Sh373 billion), ranking her among the richest women in the United States.\n\nForbes data indicate that in 2021, the year she was nominated to be the ambassador to Kenya, her peak net worth was $5.8 billion. This usually fluctuates depending on various factors, including stock markets.\n\nBack to the question: What convinced the billionaire, most known for steering multinational e-Commerce giant eBay to astronomical growth and for leading Hewlett-Packard among other high-profile corporate positions, to take up a US government job in Nairobi?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInfluential global role\n\n“So, I was called by the President of the United States (President Joe Biden) and he asked whether I would be willing to be an ambassador. And the next sentence was, ‘We want you to go to Kenya.’ And I said, ‘Okay, tell me why. Tell me more’,” she says.\n\nMs Whitman says that in her conversation with President Biden, he explained the influential global role Africa would play in the next decades, especially given its burgeoning population.\n\n“And he said, ‘Kenya is one of the most important countries in Africa, and so I’d really like you to take up a post there. The other thing that I think would be a good fit for you and the United States is that Kenya is the East Africa leader in technology; with Safaricom, M-Pesa (a mobile money service) and the start-up community’,” says Ms Whitman, who has been inducted to the US Business Hall of Fame.\n\nIn picking her, the president believed that having an American ambassador with such vast experience, especially in technology—given Kenya’s prominent role on the continent—would be important.\n\nShe told the President: “Okay, I’m game.”\n\nBut being a daughter, wife, mother and grandmother, it was not a decision she would make on her own. So, what did those closest to her think about this? Throughout the interview, the significance of her family, especially in some of the most important decisions in her personal and professional career, stands out.\n\nHer two sons—Griff Harsh and Will Harsh —encouraged her to take up the ambassadorial job because “life is about experiences and we think it would be a great experience.” It did not matter that she had never been a diplomat before and her husband, Dr Griffith R Harsh, a renowned neurosurgeon in the United States, decided to come with her to Nairobi.\n\n“As it turns out, American medical licences are good in just three countries outside the US. Kenya is one of them. And so, he is now trying to decide what he will do as he gets settled in Kenya,” she tells Sunday Nation about a man whose unwavering support alongside that of her mother is acknowledged throughout Ms Whitman’s book, The Power of Many.\n\nShe goes on: “It turns out that households don’t run themselves. And so, just getting the household set up, learning how to use M-Pesa, understanding how we get around and where to go, I have had no time. So, that has fallen to him.”\n\nBesides, Ms Whitman had to resign from the board of General Motors, Procter & Gamble, and Teach for America among others, to satisfy the requirements for her appointment. Ambassadorial duties, she says, require the relinquishing of all such positions.\n\nRead: Joe Biden nominates ex-HP boss as US ambassador to Kenya\n\nEven though she had been to Kenya before in 2018 during a two-week visit that also included travelling to Tanzania as a member of the board of trustees of The Nature Conservancy, a US-headquartered global environmental organisation, this time it was different.\n\nMs Whitman’s nomination was considered by the US Senate and confirmed on July 14 this year. She came to Kenya on August 1 to take over from Kyle McCarter. It was not until August 5 that President Uhuru Kenyatta, whose term ended this month, received her credentials. Significantly, it was just four days to one of Kenya’s most closely contested elections.\n\nTake on general election\n\nWith that, she was thrust headlong into the General Election. She admits that she had been researching a lot about Kenyan politics, but a lot was new. Ms Whitman’s conclusion is that the election was “remarkable”.\n\n“Democracy has prevailed here,” she says. “The outcome was ultimately contested, but in an appropriate, non-violent way—right to the Supreme Court that adjudicated and the candidates accepted the results. And I think it was a shining moment for Kenya.”\n\nShe goes on: “Kenyans should be very proud of the process that took place here. It was, I think, a model even for East Africa and all of Africa and, frankly, a model for the world.”\n\nShe was an observer on Election Day and her experience at Nairobi Primary School is stuck in her mind. She marvelled at the calmness and organisation of the voting—though she thought the ballot papers were “very long and many ”.\n\nMs Whitman says that the US had no preferred candidate in the election: “The US was very clear that this was a Kenyan election by Kenyans for Kenyans. We are here only to be supportive if we can be in terms of transparency and as election observers. But we did not have a preferred candidate.”\n\nNonetheless, there appear to have been shuttle diplomacy by Western envoys during the post-election period. On August 18, for example, Ms Whitman was in a team that included Delaware Senator Chris Coons, which separately met with Mr Kenyatta, Kenya Kwanza Alliance’s William Ruto (then President-elect) and Mr Raila Odinga of Azimio La Umoja-One Kenya Coalition Party.\n\nWhat was this all about? She says Mr Coons was the reason the meetings happened.\n\n“As you probably know, Senator Coons has a long history with Africa and a long history in Kenya. He did his first year of college at the University of Nairobi. And he speaks quite fluent Swahili.\n\n“So, he knew all three (Mr Kenyatta, Mr Ruto and Mr Odinga) and he actually arranged these meetings. They (the neetings) were really about checking in with his friends and talking about where we were in the election and encouraging what was already underway—which was a peaceful resolution to the challenge at the Supreme Court,” says Ms Whitman.\n\nBut did the US and other global powers fear Mr Kenyatta would cling to power and frustrate a peaceful transition? The envoy says she never had such doubts, given her interactions with him.\n\n“I would say we were quite confident,” she says. “When I met with President Kenyatta as I presented my credentials, I said, ‘I have every confidence that this election will go as you all hope it will: violence-free, a peaceful transfer of power.’ And that’s exactly what happened. And I, in the US embassy, had confidence that this would go smoothly. And it did.”\n\nVisa backlog\n\nMs Whitman’s management style celebrates competence and teamwork. Early in her tenure, she has had to confront some long-standing challenges at the embassy that she says she is confident she will resolve.\n\nThe backlog in handling visa applications of Kenyans has resulted in long waiting times, and has been top on her agenda after complaints from those who had been forced to reschedule or cancel their travel plans.\n\nAs part of the efforts to streamline operations, the American embassy recently waived interview requirements for some categories of visa renewal applications. She says she recently spent a few hours working with the teams processing the visas and, after some training, helped to take applicants’ fingerprints.\n\n“I’m not trained to do the interviews (like the consular officials) but anyone can do finger-printing,” she says, laughing.\n\nThe embassy now has a new “very experienced” consul-general, she says, and the ambassador hopes that the appointment, plus the recent repeal of a requirement for visa interviews for some categories, will eventually help clear the backlog and improve the US visa application experience.\n\nIf she still sticks to her worldview when she wrote her 2010 book, The Power of Many, she will be slow on parties and showy treats for embassy staff. While emerging tech companies indulged in parties, she writes, eBay was focused on spending only on the necessities and paying its staff well.\n\n“Beyond vetoing fluff and excess, I was determined to make sure eBay remained a lean, efficient company in other ways, too,” she wrote.\n\nSo what drove her as a pioneer woman corporate executive often breaking the proverbial glass ceiling?\n\nBecause of her career choices, Ms Whitman has at times worked in set-ups where she was the only woman in the room, but she is grateful for the mentorship from her mother and her early workplace influences for building in her the spirit to fight on.\n\n“From the earliest day, my mother told my brother, my sister and me: ‘You can do anything you want.’ And I amazingly believed her. There was no reason to believe her, but she was very persuasive and confident. And she said, ‘Don’t let people tell you you can’t do it. You figure it out,’” says Ms Whitman.\n\nShe adds; “I landed the US ambassador job. I’m not a career diplomat. I’ve never done this before. So, at first, you’re thinking, ‘Hmm, how am I going to do this?’ And then you figure it out. And so, my advice to men and women is: Give yourself a little latitude to figure it out.”\n\nAmerica has previously sent some colourful and controversial envoys to Nairobi, so what should Kenya expect during her term? She says democracy and transparency remain important and she will also focus on economic development—particularly small and medium enterprises.\n\n“How to take this digital environment and make it work for small- to medium businesses is a real passion of mine,” she says, saluting President Ruto for also focusing on enterprise in his manifesto.\n\n“What Kenyans have to build on are things like the penetration of M-Pesa. I’m not sure that Kenyans realise how impressive this is. In Silicon Valley, we all knew about M-Pesa and were amazed at the penetration and how it had lifted people out of poverty and now everyone in Kenya is banked,” says Ms Whitman.\n\nHer assessment of Kenya’s technology scene is that it is at its infancy but has tremendous potential.\n\n“I think it’s very vibrant, but maybe at the beginning of the cycle,” she says. “What you need to create an even more vibrant tech scene is some large companies: Safaricom, now Google is here, Microsoft,among others. What they are doing is bringing in young tech workers and training them.”\n\nSuch an environment with many skilled people helps create start-ups.\n\n“Then you need an investment community: venture capital. And venture capital is alive and well in Kenya. In fact, if you adjust for the size of GDP of the country, Kenya has the biggest venture capital sector on the continent of Africa,” she says.\n\nMs Whitman emphasises the importance of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem) for long-term gains.\n\n“You need some very good universities who are training computer scientists, mechanical engineers, civil engineers in Stem. I would encourage the leading universities here to think about investing in training more Stem students,” she says.\n\nMs Whitman, who is often listed as one of the most influential women in the world, particularly points out that “unless girls major in Stem and go through high school with a good maths and science background, you’re not going to have the women to take the jobs in technology.”\n\nFood security\n\nDuring her tenure in Kenya, she says she will also focus on food security. Ms Whitman is perturbed by the humanitarian crisis caused by the drought in north-eastern Kenya and the Horn of Africa that is “perhaps the largest in the world right now”.\n\nShe says she will also put emphasis on conservation.\n\n“What Kenya has done around community conservancies is extraordinary. You know, the national parks, I think, comprise around two to three per cent of Kenyan lands. If you add all the community conservancies, it could go up to 12 per cent of Kenya—and I am being conservative. And, obviously, tourism is a big source of foreign exchange and a big part of the economy,” she says.\n\nSpeaking of the economy, it is widely acknowledged that Kenya-US trade relations are lopsided in favour of the superpower. The trade window facilitated by Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa) has been among the key areas to bridge that gap. It first opened in 2000 and extended in 2015, but stares at an uncertain future when it expires in 2025.\n\n“Kenya has benefitted, I think quite dramatically, under Agoa. They are one of the biggest beneficiaries of Agoa, particularly in apparel exports. We have seen apparel exports from Kenya to the US go up dramatically in the context of Agoa,” she says, hoping that there will be conversations about maintaining this momentum.\n\nInvestment Partnership\n\nThere is also the USA-Kenya Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations that started during the tenure of former President Donald Trump. Ms Whitman says the FTA has been binned by the Biden administration in favour of the United States-Kenya Strategic Trade and Investment Partnership (STIP) launched in July.\n\nWhile Mr Trump wanted to negotiate a bilateral trade deal, the STIP was described as “the new roadmap” to support African regional economic integration.\n\n“When new administrations come in, sometimes policies change. And so, what we now have in place is the United States-Kenya Strategic Trade and Investment Partnership that was negotiated by our United States trade representative and (Trade Cabinet Secretary) Betty Maina in the Kenyan government. And this is an important first step to ultimately perhaps even more cooperation,” says Ms Whitman.\n\nShe adds: “One of the things that I’d very much like to see is exports from Kenya to the US improve significantly. It’s important for Kenya because of the foreign exchange reserves and the opportunity for American companies to import to Kenya.”\n\nDuring Mr Kenyatta’s administration from 2013, and his predecessor Mwai Kibaki since 2003, there has been a rise in Chinese investments and trade with the Asian giant. Chinese firms, mostly state-backed, have been involved in various mega projects, including construction of the Standard Gauge Railway and the Nairobi Expressway. Is the US worried about China’s growing influence?\n\n“Secretary [of State Antony] Blinken was very clear when he was here in October 2021 that we didn’t want to say to Kenyans ‘you can’t do business with China’ but give Kenyans an opportunity to do more business with Americans. And so, we definitely are interested in making sure there is a level playing field for American companies and making sure that American companies understand the opportunity in Kenya,’” she says.\n\nMs Whitman notes: “I was the CEO of a Fortune 50 company. And I think many big American companies don’t understand the opportunity in Kenya. When you sit in America, you are thinking about Asia, Europe, Latin America – because they are so close to us – but the opportunity in Africa and in Kenya is great.”\n\nThe American embassy has also been under fire for its travel advisories over the years. Under Ms Whitman, two that warned American citizens against travelling to Kisumu on key dates around the presidential election—the announcement of the results and the Supreme Court verdict—have stirred debate.\n\n“Our first job as the embassy and [for me] as the US ambassador is to make sure that Americans and embassy personnel are safe. And this is true not only for Kenya but for every country in the world: safety of Americans and embassy personnel is number one. We had no information that you didn’t have, but our second biggest installation outside of Nairobi is Kisumu,” she says, adding that the precaution could have been informed by “some violence in previous elections”.\n\nSays Ms Whitman: “I have no real latitude about whether to issue those warnings or not. They are really required by the United States government in these kinds of circumstances. Fortunately, Kisumu was perfect. There was no violence there, and so we were happy about that.”\n\nUS Supreme Court\n\nShe explains that even though she did not have a lot of latitude on the decision to issue those warnings, “as we go forward, we’ll try to think about these as carefully as we can.”\n\nWe held the interview three months after the US Supreme Court overturned the Roe v Wade judgment, effectively removing many liberties for women on abortion. Will that affect the US government’s funding of reproductive health rights in Kenya? Ms Whitman says a categorical “no”.\n\n“President Biden has been very clear that in the US, he will continue to support women’s rights to choose,” says Ms Whitman. “The State Department and the mission in Nairobi will not change policies on that.”\n\nPresidential ambition?\n\nHaving been previously listed by some publications as one of the people most likely to be America’s first woman president, she is categorical during our interview that she would not consider getting into the race for the White House.\n\n“I ran for governor of California (in 2010). As you know, I lost [to Jerry Brown]. And I sort of did my turn at elective politics. So, you will not see me run again,” she says.\n\nMs Whitman has visited a few places outside Nairobi, most recently Kisumu, but hopes to travel more. And true to her love for the outdoors, she has already been to Ngong Hills and Mt Longonot for a hike. She has also visited the Amboseli National Park and the Maasai Mara.\n\n“But that’s just the beginning of my travel. I want to get out to places beyond Nairobi. Nairobi is very important, but I want to make sure I get out to towns and villages across Kenya.”\n\nWe had to wind up our interview exactly when our scheduled hour with her ran out. She was rushing to address a gathering of women in technology hosted by the embassy.\n\nDorcas Odumbe contributed to this article with additional interview questions\n\n[email protected]",

    "Kenya quashes order on compulsory use of SGR for cargo transport": "By ANTHONY KITIMO More by this Author\n\nTraders can now clear their cargo at the Port of Mombasa and choose the mode of transport to Nairobi and the hinterlands after Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) reverted custom services to the coastal city in line with a presidential decree.\n\nKPA has issued a notice to quash a 2018 notification banning the nomination of cargo to Mombasa and compulsory use of the standard gauge railway (SGR) for ferrying cargo.\n\n“This is, therefore, to notify all shipping lines that importers’ documentation of place of clearance and mode of transport for their goods shall be at their choice,” acting KPA Managing Director John Mwangemi said in the notice on Monday.\n\n“Shipping lines are hereby advised to facilitate importers’ nomination of place of clearance, including port clearance, Kenya Revenue Authority’s licensed container freight stations (CFSs) and KPA’s inland container depots (ICDs). This notice supersedes the notice of 6th June 2018 on similar subject,” KPA said.\n\nShippers’ take\n\nThe Shippers Council of Eastern Africa (SCEA) chief executive Gilbert Lagat said the notice has ended confusion on the implementation of the presidential directive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“This is very clear. We are happy with the directive. The place and choice of mode and place of clearance rest with the shipper. This is what we had been pushing for to allow cargo clearance and delivery to compete on efficiency, predictability and cost-effectiveness,” said Mr Lagat.\n\nHe added, “rail, road, port, CFSs and ICDs will compete on level ground. We expect the cost to respond to market dynamics as it is a win-win for all.”\n\nPresident William Ruto issued a directive a fortnight ago ordering that all cargo clearance be reverted to Mombasa port.\n\nCargo transporters had been protesting the directive by former President Uhuru Kenyatta to ferry their goods to Nairobi or Naivasha via the SGR for onward clearance, saying it had raised the cost of doing business, with the costs passed on to consumers.\n\nKenya Transport Association chairman Newton Wang’oo said SGR should compete with roads on an equal opportunity basis, which will ultimately lower the cost of transport and improve services.\n\n“This is a positive move. We have been fighting against forced railage. Let us looks out for the implementation of the directive on the ground,” said Mr Wang’oo.",
    "What interactive maps and 3D digital models reveal about Mau Mau detention camps in Kenya": "In a new documentary released last month in the UK, Kenyan and British historians describe how Britain secretly used torture against prisoners in Mau Mau detention camps during the anti-colonial uprising movement in the 1950s. One of the Kenyans featured is historian and digital heritage scholar Chao Tayiana, the founder of the African Digital Heritage Project (ADHP), an organization focusing on the use of technology in preserving and sharing African heritage.\n\n“It really flipped the script as to who is uncivilized,” Tayiana says in the film, which reveals details from a secret archive known as the “Hanslope Disclosure” that remained hidden from public view for over 50 years. The archive contained damning evidence on Britain’s use of torture including murder, rape, and forced castrations against Mau Mau prisoners. Surviving veterans of this period are also featured in the film, and describe the appalling conditions they endured in detention.\n\n\n\n“Oral history is treated as second rate compared to written knowledge, and so it hasn’t mattered in many years that veterans and people who lived through this period have been saying that this happened,” Tayiana tells Quartz. “It was only until the disclosure of the archives proving that there was torture that people really started listening.”\n\n\n\nHistory of the Mau Mau uprising\n\nThe Mau Mau was an armed rebellion launched by the Kikuyu people demanding the return of stolen land from white British settlers as well as money for independence. The British declared a State of Emergency in 1952 to counter the uprising, with the executive order to put in detention camps anyone who opposed colonial rule. Unofficial figures estimate that tens of thousands of Kenyans were executed, tortured, or maimed during the crackdown, which lasted until 1960.\n\nHistorians estimate that more than 100 camps were set up during this period, yet remarkably little is known about their history in both Kenyan and British public spaces today.\n\nThe Mau Mau were eventually defeated, but the uprising is regarded as one of the most significant steps towards Kenyan independence in 1963.\n\nDigitizing Britain’s detention camps\n\nSince 2019, Tayiana has been working in collaboration with volunteers and colleagues in Kenya and the UK to document, digitally reconstruct, and curate an exhibition that sheds light on the Mau Mau detention camps that were built by the British in the early 1950s.\n\n“Visual language and imagery is very powerful in informing our understanding of the past but also helping us get a sense of where things are located in time and physically,” says Tayiana. “So [the ADHP] asks how this data can be communicated in multiple ways, through multiple mediums to audiences across the board.”\n\nThe ADHP works with museums, archives, and communities to document African histories through innovative technology that centers human experiences and oral histories. The project has so far created a number of open source digital assets including 3D digital models and interactive maps that show the detention camps were spread out all over the country, and included exile camps, detention camps, work camps and women and juvenile camps.\n\nThese digital reconstructions rely on extensive research and sources including oral and written testimonials, existing plans and 3D scans, as well as some physical remains from the campsites. The goal is to create a better representation of shared history and to make these assets more accessible to more people, regardless of their literacy levels or knowledge of English.\n\n“The biggest knowledge gap regarding that period is really around the human experience,” says Tayiana. “We are aware of the camps, we’re aware they existed, but we don’t really know much about what took place. The human experience is very abstracted from the nationalist story of how the Mau Mau fought and they got independence.”\n\nA ‘lifecycle’ between digital and physical work\n\nDespite the opportunities in using technology to reproduce cultural value and meaning, Tayiana says the ADHP faces limitations with resources and infrastructure to carry out its digitization efforts. Digital reach is also a factor, she says, as many target audiences in Kenya still do not have easy access to digital technologies.\n\n“We ended up reaching a very specific demographic, which is 18 to 34 year olds who are on Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook,” she said. “One of the things we think of is how can this primary audience then reach another secondary audience, so maybe their grandparents or their parents. We try to create a lifecycle between digital work and physical work, because I don’t believe they should be separate.”\n\nTayiana acknowledges that digital reconstructions will never be completely accurate, and she says remaining open to feedback and input is crucial. Next year, the team will begin incorporating more assets and cultural context to the map, beyond the epicenter of the violence in central Kenya. They are also currently working on a physical exhibition in Kenya about the approximately 800 concentrated villages that were set aside for around 1 million women and children during the Mau Mau uprising.\n\nThese villages were managed by British officials and ‘home guards’—armed non-Mau Mau Africans that were falsely branded ‘loyalists’ by colonial rulers. Tayiana says women and children were subject to cruel treatment including forced curfews, and they were not allowed to grow their own food or manage their own land resources.\n\n“The exhibition really centers on what that did to the societal fabric of these villages … and how the officials treated women.”\n\nTayiana says the exhibition will include the physical remains of a trench that was dug around the village, as well as the archives and oral histories collected from survivors.\n\nDocumenting history before it’s too late\n\nTayiana’s work with the ADHP is mirrored by her other initiatives that center human experience and value oral histories. In 2018, she founded the Museum of British Colonialism—a digital platform which facilitates global conversations on Britain’s colonial legacies. She is also the founder of the Open Restitution Africa project which gathers data on current restitution processes across the African continent.\n\nThere is a sense of urgency in much of her work to document these histories before it is too late. This is particularly true for the Mau Mau detention camps, as there are fewer veterans alive today to tell their stories.\n\n“This history is not being taught to the extent to which it should be taught in Kenya,” she said. “There are still a lot of wounds and silences here in the country regarding this period. But what’s interesting about this history, I think, is that there are so many factors that are working against it. And so the very fact that it did make its way to light…is something we really need to pay attention to.”",

On the side of the road, you can buy anything from a samosa to furniture to a puppy. But my favorite thing is that on the side of almost every street, you find a nursery. Hundreds, maybe thousands, of Kenyans commandeer little strips of land, and they grow everything from roses to azaleas to delicate gardenias.\n\nGEORGE JENGA: I'm George Jenga. When you translate Jenga, it comes George builder.\n\nPERALTA: Nearly 20 years ago, unable to get a job, George went into the forests of the outskirts of Nairobi and started collecting seeds. Since then, he's turned this bit of roadside into paradise. He walks me through his garden, a smile on his face. He has learned as much as he can about all of his plants.\n\nJENGA: Like, this one is called Podocarpus falcatus. This one is good for timber.\n\nPERALTA: He picks a hard, round seed.\n\nJENGA: This pod, it germinate within one year and eight months.\n\nPERALTA: Most of the plant sellers in Nairobi sell flowers. They grow quick, and it is what people want, but not George. What George loves are indigenous trees. So he waits years for a pod to turn into a seedling to turn into a tree.\n\nJENGA: Our generation is not for the trees. They are going after quick money. And quick money, you cannot get it while you are in a garden.\n\nPERALTA: George moves fast past his flowers. They're just not his thing. But about trees, he can talk for days.\n\nJENGA: This is Vitex keniensis. In English, it is called Meru oak. This one, it is called Calodendrum capense. The seed has a lot of oil.\n\nPERALTA: For wrinkles, he says. He keeps calling out names and uses. But as we move away from the road, his nursery becomes an oasis. We start hearing birds. He dodges bamboo, skips over rocks, and suddenly, we hit a stream. This is the source of life for his plants.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF WATER FLOWING)\n\nPERALTA: This is the most charming part of Nairobi, that in the middle of all the chaos, there is always beauty. It's a place where you discover that the aphids making your roses brown also attract hummingbirds, so you let them be.\n\nI can see why you like this.\n\nJENGA: You know, a wise scholar said when you treat the nature the well, the nature will reward you. I’ve been rewarded\n\nPERALTA: He's in good health. His kids have gone to school off these plants. And it's not lost on him that as Nairobi becomes a mega city and climate change ravages the Earth, at least hundreds of thousands of trees have passed through his hands. Sometimes, he says, he sees some of his seedlings around town.\n\nJENGA: I walk there. I see a tree. I laugh myself. This has come from my hand.\n\nPERALTA: (Laughter) So that's a good feeling.\n\nJENGA: Yes. I feel...\n\nPERALTA: Yeah.\n\nJENGA: Yes.\n\nPERALTA: Yeah. You're fulfilled.\n\nJENGA: Yes. I have done my part.\n\nPERALTA: He shakes his head. He didn't graduate high school, he tells me, but he has done his part. Eyder Peralta, NPR News, Nairobi.\n\nCopyright © 2022 NPR.

    "Kenya frets about future trade with U.S.": "Kenya frets about future trade with U.S. Presented by\n\nQuick Fix\n\n— Kenya, the only African country engaged in bilateral trade talks with the United States, is worried about losing U.S. duty-free access for its apparel and other goods because the negotiations do not cover tariffs.\n\n— House lawmakers will introduce legislation today to suspend tariffs on base powder, an essential ingredient in infant formula, through Dec. 31 in a move supporters hope will spur domestic formula production and further alleviate the national shortage.\n\n— USTR on Friday outlined a short list of negotiating objectives for the trade pillar of the proposed Indo-Pacific Economic Framework agreement, just two weeks after all 14 participants agreed on joint goals.\n\nIt’s Monday, Sept. 26. Welcome to Morning Trade. Today is a good day to repair a leak in your basement, according to my 1974 Popular Science Homeowners Almanac.

His Commerce Department, however, is continuing to pursue them – possibly to implement when the moratorium expires. If not stopped, these meritless tariffs would slam the brakes on solar deployment, undermining efforts by the President and Congress to promote clean energy jobs and address climate change. Commerce Secretary Raimondo: Please Reject Meritless and Damaging Solar Tariffs.\n\nWant to receive this newsletter every weekday? Subscribe to POLITICO Pro. You’ll also receive daily policy news and other intelligence you need to act on the day’s biggest stories.\n\n\n\nDriving The Day\n\nKENYAN MANUFACTURERS WANT PERMANENT DUTY-FREE ACCESS: The Biden administration has been clear that none of its trade negotiations cover tariffs. That includes talks with the U.K., the EU and the Indo-Pacific region, as well as the Strategic Trade and Investment Partnership talks with Kenya.\n\nIn Kenya’s case, the country already has duty-free access to the United States for most of its goods under the African Growth and Opportunity Act. But the Biden administration has not said yet whether it supports renewal of that legislation, which expires in 2025.\n\nSo, in comments filed with the USTR, the Kenya Association of Manufacturers requested that duty-free access be continued, either as part of a bilateral trade agreement or through renewal of the nearly quarter century old AGOA program.\n\n“With unemployment and under employment challenges in Kenya at a record high, the contribution of AGOA to creating job opportunities cannot be underestimated,” the group said.\n\nThe Corporate Council on Africa, a U.S. business group, also urged continuation of Kenya’s duty-free access, noting the West African country is “the largest AGOA exporter of apparel to the U.S., totaling $449 million in 2021 and accounting for some 50,000 direct jobs.”\n\nBut it’s “important that we have an agreement with Kenya that establishes a broader economic partnership that goes beyond AGOA’s unilateral preferences and addresses more than just tariffs and goods market access,” the CCA added.\n\nAdditional areas should include digital trade and financial services, as well as provisions that promote deeper foreign investment and protect investors from unfair treatment, the group said.\n\nTrade activists at Public Citizen approached the market access question from the other side, arguing that it’s hard to see how a bilateral agreement with the United States would be better for Kenya than a simple renewal of the AGOA program since “history has shown that countries signing trade agreements with the United States have to make major anti-development concessions.”\n\nThe group urged USTR not to negotiate a traditional free trade agreement with Kenya because that would have “catastrophic policy and political repercussions.”\n\nFIRST IN MORNING TRADE: The Bulk Infant Formula to Retail Shelves Act is being proposed by members of the Ways and Means trade subcommittee, including Reps. Suzan DelBene (D-Wash.), Earl Blumenauer(D-Ore.), Drew Ferguson (R-Ga.), Dan Kildee (D-Mich.), John Larson (D-Conn.) and Adrian Smith (R-Neb.).\n\nIn July, those same lawmakers rallied broad bipartisan support for the Formula Act, a bill that temporarily lifted tariffs on imports of finished formula. U.S. formula companies lobbied heavily for base powder to be included in that earlier bill, but the provision was excluded amid concerns expressed by dairy producers.\n\nWhile shelves are better stocked today than over the summer, formula remains difficult for many families to come by. “The legislation I’m introducing today will build on that progress by helping increase domestic formula production,” DelBene said in a statement. “I’m hopeful that this bill can move with the same speed and bipartisan support that the previous legislation had.”\n\nG20 TRADE MINISTERS CLASH OVER RUSSIA: A meeting between trade ministers from the world’s leading economies in Bali, Indonesia, ended without a joint statement Friday after representatives disagreed over whether to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIndonesia was expected instead to issue “a chair’s statement” outlining the six priorities that lower level officials agreed on earlier in the week. Those include WTO reforms, a multilateral approach to industrialization, digital trade and the pandemic response, as well as the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nThe G-20 host issued a press release Friday that did not mention the minister’s failure to agree on a joint statement or include a link to a chair’s statement. G-20 finance ministers also failed to agree on a joint statement when they met in July.\n\nIndonesian softball: The European Union, which released its own readout of the gathering, said most countries agreed the conflict was the primary challenge for international trade and “condemned this gross violation of international law.”\n\nThe U.S., France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Britain objected to the statement produced by Indonesian Trade Minister Zulkifli Hasan since it didn’t include explicit condemnation of Russia, according to international media reports.\n\n\"Of the 27 paragraphs of the joint statement, 26 were agreed, one was not. The paragraph that was not agreed upon was about geopolitical issues. There was no consensus,\" Hasan was quoted as saying.\n\nAgriculture is next: G-20 agriculture ministers will be in Bali later this week to discuss global food security, efforts to boost sustainability and related concerns.\n\nTai heads to Japan: Tai will be in Tokyo Tuesday to attend former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s state funeral. The U.S. delegation is led by Vice President Kamala Harris, who also will visit South Korea on the trip.\n\n\n\nMENENDEZ HOLDS UP MCKALIP AG NOMINATION: Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) has placed a hold on the nomination of Doug McKalip to be USTR’s chief agricultural negotiator until he receives assurances the agency will establish procedures for greater congressional oversight and transparency of U.S. trade policy, a spokesperson for the senator confirmed after Inside U.S. Trade reported the action last week.\n\n“As [Menendez] awaits commitments and specific actions to this end, he opposes confirmation of this nominee as a way to send the clearest signal that he firmly believes Americans deserve honest and transparent trade policy that prioritizes the economic interests of the country and cracks down on waste, fraud, and abuse,” the spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nLong time coming: Menendez was one of six senators in May to sign a letter to Ambassador Katherine Tai that claimed the agency was not upholding its own transparency standards, and failed to properly consult Congress in dealings with the World Trade Organization involving intellectual property and Covid-19 vaccines.\n\nFarm groups impatient: Last week, a coalition of 105 agriculture and food associations and companies sent a letter to Senate leaders urging a swift floor vote on McKalip’s nomination. The Senate Finance Committee voted 27-0 in favor of advancing the long-time government employee’s nomination two weeks ago, with Menendez abstaining.\n\nA BRIEF GLIMPSE OF U.S. IPEF GOALS: A USTR spokesperson called the short outline of the agency’s negotiating objectives \"a vision document that is guiding our conversations with IPEF partners and stakeholders.\" It runs just slightly more than two pages, although USTR said it could be updated at a later date.\n\nIn May 2021, the Biden administration committed to following certain “Guidelines for Consultation and Engagement” developed by the Obama administration in 2015.\n\nThose guidelines say “at least 30 days before initiating negotiations for a trade agreement, USTR will publish a detailed and comprehensive summary of the specific objectives with respect to the negotiations and a description of how the agreement, if successfully concluded, will further those objectives and benefit the United States.”\n\nThe guidelines also say USTR will hold a public hearing on the negotiating objectives. However, a USTR spokesperson said those transparency commitments that Tai reaffirmed do not apply to IPEF since it is an “executive” agreement not subject to congressional approval.\n\n\n\nCANADIAN DAIRY WAITING GAME: It’s been about 120 days since USTR initiated a second dairy dispute with Canada after its first effort failed to force Ottawa to open its market as much as U.S. industry believes it should be under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\n\nBy now, USTR is within its rights to request another dispute settlement panel to hear its complaint since no deal to resolve the disagreement has been announced. However, a USTR spokesperson on Friday provided little information on that. “We’re engaged with Canada on next steps, in close coordination with stakeholders,” the spokesperson said.\n\nBecky Rasdall, vice president for trade policy and international affairs at the International Dairy Foods Association, said it has “been in communication with USTR about the substance of the second round of consultations and are working to support their efforts.”\n\nWhat’s next: Although timing is still uncertain, “we support proceeding with the second dispute when USTR is ready,” Rasdall said.\n\nARE YOU READY FOR SOME TRADE TALK? Unfortunately, we couldn’t get Hank Williams Jr. to kick off the WTO’s Public Forum this week, but I’ll try my best to pump you up about the annual gabfest. I mean, if four days of multi-room discussions on every conceivable trade topic is your idea of heaven, then Geneva is where you want to be this week.\n\nJust imagine being trapped in a building and every door you open is a different Washington International Trade Association event. It’ll be something like that. And to get the ball rolling, WTO Director General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala will sit down Tuesday with CNN’s Business Editor-at-Large Richard Quest for a scene-setting chat.\n\nFor anyone who forgot to book a flight to Switzerland, you can watch select events on the web. For fans of the beautiful game, Okonjo-Iweala also will be talking Tuesday with FIFA President Gianni Infantino. I guess somebody’s ready for some football!

    "Global economy a ‘two-lane highway’, says Kenyan President during UN speech": "Mr. Ruto warned that rising nationalism is undermining collective action and the ability of the international community to guarantee fundamental rights. He argued that, as a consequence, countries of the Global South are calling for global governance to be more democratic and inclusive, as they attempt to get their economies back on track.\n\nBuilding Back Better, from the Bottom\n\nInvoking the oft-heard phrase “Build Back Better”, Mr. Ruto added a new clause, calling for the global economic recovery to take place from the bottom upwards, by including the marginalised working majority in the economic mainstream.\n\n“The bottom billion,” he said, “relentlessly wage their daily battle for survival in a a crowded arena characterised by scarcity of opportunity and a generally precarious existence.”\n\nHe went on to praise the “hustlers” who survive against overwhelming odds, and urged for action to bring them into the mainstream.\n\nReacting to drought and famine\n\nTurning to the climate crisis, Mr. Ruto noted that droughts and heat waves in Kenya, the scale of which has not been seen in decades, have forced the country to put more focus on famine relief, education support, social protection, and health systems. 3.1 million people in the country are food insecure, he said, as water becomes more scarce, and food prices rise.\n\nMr. Ruto recalled that the Stockholm+50 meeting, which commemorated the anniversary of the first UN conference on the human environment in 1972, was co-hosted by Kenya.\n\nThe Kenyan President noted that, at that international meeting, there was consensus from States on the need to act urgently in addressing environmental impacts, yet “little progress has been made in respect of the needful actions”.\n\nKenya, he said, is responding to the climate emergency by investing in climate-resilient agriculture, as part of a 10-year strategy for growth in the agricultural sector, which will “continue to hold the key to the creation of equitable and sustainable growth” for the Kenyan people.\n\nThis sector, as with others including education and health, is increasingly reliant on digital access and, said Mr. Ruto, offer a “viable shortcut to poverty reduction and the promotion of inclusive development”.\n\nThe President called for stronger global partnerships to enhance ICT (information and communication technology) infrastructure in developing countries, in order to bridge the digital divide between the Global South and the rest of the world.\n\nContinued commitment to UN agencies\n\nKenya is the host nation to the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the UN Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), and Mr. Ruto affirmed the “indispensable role” the agencies play in the promotion of environmental sustainability globally, and in developing socially and environmentally sound and sustainable cities.\n\nMr. Ruto announced that his Government has made more land available for the United Nations Office in Nairobi (UNON), to facilitate the upgrading of its complex.\n\nThe Ocean and Blue Economy, declared the President, remain a development priority for Kenya, in the belief that significantly increased investment can end hunger, reduce poverty, create jobs, and spur economic growth.\n\nHe reported that Kenya is reviewing its National Blue Economy Strategy to strengthen community structures – in participatory management of freshwater, coastal and marine resources, and ecosystems – and invited development partnerships to invest in Africa towards building capacity to sustainably utilise marine resources.\n\nWorking towards a national vision of the future\n\nOver the past decade, said Mr. Ruto, Kenya has implementing it’s National Vision 2030, a blueprint to transform the country into a “newly-industrialising, upper-middle-income country providing high quality of life to all its citizen in a clean and secure environment by 2030”.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic forced the Government, he said, to intervene in the economy in new ways, such as the implementation of an Economic Stimulus Programme, a Covid-19 Economic Recovery Strategy and a Covid-19 Social Economic re-engineering Recovery Strategy, all aimed at mitigating the adverse impacts of the pandemic.\n\nMr. Ruto went on to point out that support will be necessary from the international community, without which Kenya risks losing its development gains. He asked for additional liquidity and a better “fiscal space,” to enable Kenya to enhance social investment, support climate change adaptation and mitigation, address security needs and resolve development financing challenges.\n\nIn addition, the President joined other leaders in calling on multilateral lenders to extend pandemic-related debt relief to the worst hit counties, especially those affected by the devastating combination of conflict, climate change and COVID-19. He also urged the G20 group of leading economies to suspend or reschedule debt repayments by middle-income countries during the pandemic recovery period.\n\n‘Reform the Security Council’\n\nSpeaking as the leader of a country that is a non-permanent member of the Security Council, Mr. Ruto declared that Kenya has continued to champion closer cooperation between regional mechanisms and the Security Council as an effective means of achieving international peace and security.\n\n“We are committed to finding a stronger African voice in the Council”, he said, “and achieving a consensus driven, rule-based multilateral system.”\n\nHowever, he also noted that the Security Council needs to be reformed, to make it more democratic: “given the magnitude and variety of challenges the world continues to confront, a more fit-for-purpose United Nations is urgently needed, that possesses the legitimacy and efficacy in dealing with threats to international peace and security.”\n\nMr. Ruto went on to lament the failures of multilateralism, with regard to Africa, remarking that the last time that Africa was the focal point of strong and effective multilateral consensus was during the Berlin Conferences of 1884-1885 [which led to imperial European powers effectively divided up much of Africa between them].\n\n“We have an urgent moral duty to do better”, he continued, “and to right this wrong.”\n\nNevertheless, the President concluded that strengthening multilateralism is the only sustainable path to a peaceful, stable, and prosperous world for all.\n\n“This is the imperative of our time”, he declared, “and the call of this moment. It is time to work on the trust deficit with stronger conviction that none of us is really safe until all of us are safe”.\n\n",
    "Modest rate hikes seen for Nigeria, Kenya; Ghana to hold": "JOHANNESBURG, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Nigeria and Kenya are likely to hike interest rates by a modest 50 basis points in the coming days after months of heavy lifting from other African central banks to try to calm rampant inflation, a Reuters poll found, while Ghana will hold fire.\n\nThis week's benchmark interest rate decisions remain a very close call without any clear majority by analysts.\n\nA scarcity of dollars is fuelling inflation in Ghana and Nigeria, as well as other parts of the continent like Ethiopia, and all are still licking their wounds from waves of rate increases in the United States that have siphoned away greenbacks and weakened domestic currencies.\n\n\"Tightening global financial conditions and continued dollar appreciation will set the tone for upcoming sub-Saharan Africa central bank decisions,\" said Razia Khan at Standard Chartered, who expects action in both Nigeria and Kenya.\n\nFor Nigeria, a median of 10 analysts suggested rates would increase by 50 basis points (bps) to 14.5% on Tuesday. But while four respondents agreed with the median the rest were divided between no change and up to a 150 basis points lift.\n\nThe Central Bank of Kenya has been one of the least active in the continent in an election year that saw William Ruto sworn in as Kenya's fifth president. Rates were expected to be hiked for a second time by 50 bps on Thursday, taking them to 8.0%.\n\nBut again, the outcome was a close call with the breakdown of 11 analysts showing five predicted no change, four saw a hike of 50 bps and two expected a 100 bps increase.\n\nLike in South Africa, inflation has been high in Kenya although not as fast as in west Africa. South Africa increased its repo rate by 75 bps last week and similar hikes are expected in the next two quarters.\n\nA median of nine analysts said rates would be held at 22.0% in Ghana. Five respondents said no change while the others expected a lift of between 100 and 300 bps.\n\nThe Bank of Ghana has hiked rates by 850 bps in the past year but that has not helped stop a slide in its currency which has been one of the worst performing emerging market currency, having lost over half its value this year.\n\n\"We expect inflation to peak in Q4, before starting to recede, while the cedi has started to move sideways in recent weeks,\" said Pieter du Preez of Oxford Economics.\n\nConsumer inflation in Ghana raced to 33.9% in August, its highest since 2001 and in the same month as a 300 basis point hike in interest rates to 22.0%, the largest lending rate increase in the country's history.\n\nKhan said given Ghana's tightening was still feeding into the economy, \"we no longer expect further imminent rate changes\".\n\nGhana's central bank rescheduled its upcoming interest rate decision to Oct. 7 from Sept. 26 to coincide with the end of an International Monetary Fund mission to the country.",

    "Kenya’s Central Bank forecasts economy reboot after peaceful political transition": "By JAMES ANYANZWA More by this Author\n\nThe Central Bank of Kenya is projecting a better performance for the country’s economy, leaving behind months of electioneering and uncertainty that saw it fail in a Eurobond launch earlier in the year.\n\nKenya swore in its new president on September 13, bringing to an end uncertainty around its political future.\n\nNow the banking regulator says the peaceful change in leadership has coincided with stabilising global prices for basic commodities, which could reboot the economy.\n\nCentral Bank Governor Patrick Njoroge told Kenyan MPs this week that the economy is expected to remain “strong” this year despite weaker global growth and economic shocks triggered by the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\n“Economic growth is expected to remain strong in 2022. Prices of palm oil, DAP fertiliser and wheat have moderated,” said Dr Njoroge at an induction session for new MPs.\n\n“The price of oil has moderated but remains volatile,” he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKenya’s economy has been going through lean times. It has seen its forex reserves shrink as food and fuel prices rise, its shilling depreciates and credit to the private sector falls.\n\nThe economy is also saddled with debts, which now stand at $70 billion.\n\nIn June, the government cancelled a $1 billion Eurobond as a result of turbulence in the global financial markets. President William Ruto has scrapped the fuel and maize meal flour subsidy programmes to ease the government’s growing expenditure pressures.\n\nResearchers at Cytonn Investments noted that the government’s increased accumulation of debt has not translated into economic growth, as more than 40 percent of the collected revenues have gone to repay debt.\n\nKenya’s public debt has increased more than five-fold to Ksh8.6 trillion ($71.66 billion) in May 2022 from Ksh1.6 trillion ($13.33 billion) in May 2012.\n\nCytonn noted that the public debt increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 18.2 percent in the last 10 years, compared to an average Gross Domestic Product growth of 3.9 percent over the period.\n\n“The increase in debt is not translating into GDP growth,” Cytonn Investments said in a September 11 market report.\n\nDebt accumulation\n\nMounting debt has put pressure on central bank forex reserves, further eroding the value of the shilling which is swinging at around Ksh120 against the US dollar.\n\n“Kenya’s general business environment continues to be weighed down by the elevated inflationary pressures emanating from supply chain constraints and a depreciating local currency,” Cytonn Investments said.\n\n“The recovery of the private sector business environment in Kenya is largely pegged on how quickly the global economy stabilises and how soon the inflationary pressures ease,” it added.\n\nKenya’s GDP increased by 6.8 percent in the first quarter of 2022, compared to a 2.7 percent growth in the same period last year.\n\nHowever, overall inflation accelerated for six consecutive months to 8.5 percent in August from 8.3 percent in July, largely driven by high fuel and food prices.\n\nDisbursement of loans to key economic sectors declined to 2.5 percent between April and June compared to 4.1 percent in the previous quarter.\n\nBusiness environment\n\nThe elevated credit risk has led to 8.6 percent increase in gross non-performing loans to Ksh514.4 billion ($4.28 billion) in June 2022 from Ksh473.7 billion ($3.94 billion) in March 2022.\n\n“This is largely attributable to the deteriorated business environment as a result of the increased inflationary pressures emanating from imported inflation bill,” CBK said.\n\n“Going forward, we expect the business environment to remain subdued given the persistent supply chain bottlenecks that have seen the cost of inputs continue to rise.”",
    "US Overtakes Uganda in Buying Kenyan Goods": "New figures from Kenya's National Bureau of Statistics show the United States has overtaken Uganda as the largest buyer of Kenyan goods.\n\nThe numbers from Kenya's National Bureau of Statistics show that between January and June 2022, Kenya's exports to the United States totaled 38.8 billion Kenyan shillings — the equivalent of about $321 million.\n\nUganda's imports from Kenya dipped to about $300 million.\n\nAccording to the report, the jump was caused mainly by increased sales of Kenyan clothing apparel to the U.S.\n\nEconomists such as Ken Gichinga say the figures are a sign of Kenya’s deepening bilateral relationship with the U.S., including increased direct flights to New York.\n\n\"Americans have a bigger purchasing power for products in Kenya,\" Gichinga said. \"You find that American investors will find it a very good time to be able to purchase assets and buy things in Kenya because now, the market is in their favor.\"\n\nUganda has been the biggest buyer of Kenyan exports for over a decade. But a Kenyan publication, Business Daily, reports that Uganda's imports from Kenya have dropped as investors set up Ugandan factories to manufacture goods previously imported from Kenya, such as edible oils and cement.\n\nWangari Muikia, a Kenyan economist, said the country's strong relations with the U.S., backed by the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), will likely continue to thrive as the new government of President William Ruto is keen on more American partnerships.\n\nIn his visit to the United Nations General Assembly this week, Ruto met with U.S. State Department officials and pitched for increased business between the two nations.\n\n\"The new government is signaling pushing for greater trade with the U.S., with President Ruto meeting with the U.S. trade officials this week,\" Muikia said. \"Most excitingly in tech, where Kenya's Silicon Savannah is excelling now, a market like the U.S. will open up business for Kenya and the region.\"\n\nKenya is among African nations benefiting from a U.S. shift in foreign policy as it scales up its presence on the continent.

    "How new expressway will further hurt Kenya’s SGR fortunes": "By Business Daily Africa More by this Author\n\nKenya’s Standard Gauge Railway is set to face stiffer competition from the road network after the government revived plans to build an expressway that will run side by side with the railway.\n\nThree firms are now competing for a tender to build the 473-km Nairobi-Mombasa Expressway, which will offer an uninterrupted movement of vehicles between the two cities.\n\nThe Kenya National Highway Authority (KeNHA) says that Korean Overseas Infrastructure and Development Corporation (KIND) is the latest firm to express interest in the multi-billion tender after it submitted a Privately Initiated Investment Proposal (PIIP) for the development of the highway.\n\nThe firm will compete for the tender with American firm Bechtel Executive, which is also eyeing the lucrative multi-billion shilling tender but is now in a joint partnership with a US Capital Investment Company Everstrong Capital.\n\n“The Korean Overseas Infrastructure and Development Corporation (KIND) presented a Pre-Feasibility Studies Report for the development of the Highway based on a PPP model,” said KeNHA director–general Kungu Ndungu.\n\n“Bechtel is also still working on the best Public Private Partnership (PPP) structure for the project. Everstrong Capital) has also expressed interest in developing the Corridor in partnership with Bechtel.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis comes at a time when the SGR is already fighting for a life of its own, following President William Ruto’s order to revert port operations to Mombasa.\n\nThe return of the operations has handed trucking companies a fighting chance to wrestle the cargo business from the SGR since the order now means that importers will have free will to choose between road and railway.\n\nBefore last week’s order, importers were being forced to use the railway following a take or pay deal between the SGR financiers and the Kenyan government. This saw the government move in to shield the railway from the truckers who have the advantage of the last mile and are cheaper compared to the railway line.\n\nBut as SGR prepares to compete the trucks for the cargo business, the new expressway will tilt the competition in favour of trucks since, besides the cost and quick turnaround advantage for short hauls, they will be able to compete on speed as well.\n\nThe expressway has however also faced a number of false starts, as the government shops for the best candidate to complete the works.\n\nThe Business Daily could not immediately establish why the tender to construct the road was attracting new players bearing in mind that American contractor Bechtel had been tapped by the Kenyan government to build the road in 2018.\n\nBut sources familiar with the details say that the state may have fallen out with Bechtel who has always insisted on building the road only if the government will take a loan for the project.\n\nThe firm last year rejected Kenya’s offer to construct the road and recover its costs from charging motorists toll fees settling on a model where the state pays it for building the road.\n\nBechtel argues that the alternative PPP model where the contractor sources funds would cost five times more at $15 billion and take much longer to complete.\n\nBut Transport Cabinet Secretary James Macharia maintained the PPP model, which will see the infrastructure transferred to the State, was a cheaper option for taxpayers.\n\n“We do not want to take more debt if the private sector can do the job. National Treasury team through the PPP unit and their advisers have done the math, and preference is for PPP option,” Mr Macharia said in a past interview with the Business Daily.\n\nThe toll model has been hailed as a solution to the road financing problem since it takes the pressure off a country to accumulate public debt.\n\nMany countries, including the UK, India, Canada, France Nigeria and South Africa, have adopted the toll model to fund their road infrastructure.\n\nToll fees were introduced in Kenya in the late 1980s but were scrapped in the mid-1990s in favour of the roads maintenance levy currently charged at Sh18 per litre of petrol and diesel.\n\nKenya is seeking to maintain the pace of spending on new infrastructure with funding from private backers while reducing borrowings and budget deficits.\n\nKenya will spend Sh1.36 trillion annually in the current financial year that started in July for debt repayment, up from Sh1.15 trillion in the last fiscal period.\n\n[email protected]",
    "Is Kenya ready to reintroduce the Shamba System?": "A view of Mt Elgon Forest. [Caroline Chebet, Standard]\n\nDeputy President Rigathi Gachagua's proposal to revert to the Shamba system has sparked debate on whether Kenya is ready for the re-introduction of the system that was banned twice by different regimes.\n\nSpeaking on Saturday, in Baringo County, Gachagua hinted that the government has plans to allow peasant farmers to carry out farming in forests to boost food production in the country.\n\n\"There was Shamba System where locals could plant maize until the trees grow. This government is yours, we have made an order for Wananchi to be given an opportunity to cultivate in the forest to have more food,\" Gachagua said.\n\nHow the Shamba system worked\n\nThe agroforestry approach started way back in 1910 under tolonial rule to promote sustained and optimum production of food crops while assisting forest conservation. Under the system, agricultural crops are grown together with the forest trees.\n\nDuring the Moi administration, the system was aligned and locals would cooperate with officials from the Kenya Forest Service in matters allocation of land (mostly not more than an acre for each family).\n\nAfter allocation, the had grown after around three years, the beneficiaries would hand back the land to the Kenya Forest officials.\n\nBack then, the main aim was to afforest land where exotic trees had been cut for timber and as well as boost the food supply chain across the country.\n\nAmong the crops that were grown included; maize, beans, groundnuts, potatoes, onions and tomatoes. At the same time, those allocated the land would be allowed to harvest firewood, forest fruits and even keep beehives.\n\nWhy it was successful\n\nFrom the onset, the Shamba System was successful because at its introduction stage, the government through the Kenya Forest docket had designated personnel who worked hand in hand with farmers on a weekly basis.\n\nWith this in place, the farmer could be guided on what to plant and what not to during what season plus kinds of trees to plant and when to harvest.\n\nThe officers were also in charge of plot acquisition hence ensuring that only those with good intentions were vetted and allocated.\n\nHowever, it was later banned under the late Mwai Kibaki;s era, after it emerged that most farmers refused to move out of their allocated plots after the three-year period given elapsed and had cut down the trees.\n\nAnother major reason that led to the Kibaki-led government to abolish the Shamba System was logging, where rogue millers would collaborate with some Kenya Forest Service officials to cut trees for personal benefits.",
    "Kenyan nurse caught in Sh230 billion US fraud scheme took over criminal empire from husband": "By Vincent Achuka More by this Author\n\nTwo Kenyan nurses who defrauded the US government of $100 million (Sh230 billion) through healthcare fraud would have steered clear of trouble had they not continued with a scheme hatched by the husband of one of them, who was apprehended six years ago.\n\nMs Winnie Waruru, 42, of Lowell, Massachusetts, last week pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit healthcare fraud, conspiracy to pay and receive kickbacks, two counts of making false statements and one count of making a false statement in a healthcare matter.\n\n“The charges of healthcare fraud, conspiracy to commit healthcare fraud, money laundering conspiracy and money laundering each provide for a sentence of up to 10 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000 or twice the amount of money involved in the laundering,” said the US Department of Justice after the nurse pleaded guilty.\n\n“The conspiracy to pay kickbacks, make false statements and make a false statement in a healthcare matter each provides for a sentence of up to five years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000,” the department further said.\n\nHer co-defendant, Ms Faith Newton, 52 who is also a Kenyan and a former boss of Ms Waruru’s, denied the charges and is set to undergo full trial, with a possibility of getting a 20-year prison sentence in case she is found guilty.\n\nAll would have been well had Newton not taken over a similar scheme masterminded by her husband, Mr Francis Nderitu Kimaru, which saw the US government lose $43 million back in 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFaith Newton on her own ran a parallel medical scheme which stole $100 million (Sh230billion) after the arrest of her husband.\n\nFake claims\n\nMr Kimaru, who was the owner of Compassionate Homecare Inc, which had branches in Worcester, West Springfield and Lawrence, was arrested on October 1, 2016, after investigators found out that the company had been filing fake claims under the US Medicaid programme.\n\nStarted in 1965, the programme, which currently covers 81 million people, was designed to provide health coverage to children from low-income families, elderly people aged above 65, pregnant women and people with disabilities.\n\nThe programme, which is funded by both the federal and state governments, is administered indirectly through licensed medical providers.\n\nThe providers enrol eligible members of the population who fit the criteria set by the various states and then bill the government for services offered after certification by a licensed physician.\n\nOver the years, however, the programme, which offers a health safety net to low-class Americans at a cost of US$671 billion (Sh156 trillion), has become prone to fraudsters, who siphon billions of dollars through fraudulent claims.\n\nOne of these fraudsters was Mr Kimaru, who was 41 by the time he was arrested in 2016. The flamboyant Mr Kimaru had a fleet of luxury cars and homes spread all over Massachusetts.\n\nIt is not known when Kimaru arrived in the US, or how he met his wife Faith, but they were both registered nurses before they started their own medical facility.\n\nDocuments filed in a Massachusetts court in defence of Mr Kimaru however show that he is “a Kenyan orphan who became a US citizen after years of hard work in the United States”.\n\nDocuments accessed by the Nation’s Investigation Desk show that Compassionate Homecare was registered as a Limited Liability Company on March 16, 2010.\n\nThe company, Registration Number 001024182, operated from Suite 202 on the second floor of the 51 Union Street building in Worcester, Massachusetts.\n\nBoth Ms Faith and Mr Kimaru are registered as the managers of the company, with Mr Kimaru as the bank signatory.\n\nAll was going well for the organisation until the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) was called in after the State of Massachusetts noticed a sharp spike in the costs incurred by the Medicaid programme. That was in 2013, just three years after Compassionate Homecare was formed.\n\nA nine-bedroom palatial mansion that was bought by Faith Newton.\n\nAccording to an audit carried out before the FBI was called in, the State of Massachusetts had recorded an 82 per cent jump in programme costs, which saw it spend an unexplained Sh91 billion.\n\nThe state immediately stopped accepting applications from prospective medical providers, as investigations began on the listed providers.\n\n“More than 80 per cent of the spending growth since 2013 has been driven by 62 companies that started doing business with the state during that time,” said the State of Massachusetts at the beginning of the probe.\n\nThings went haywire for Compassionate Homecare when one of the doctors licensed by the State of Massachusetts complained that the company was seeking authorisation to provide services, through “phony” referral forms, for patients who did not need home health services.\n\nThree-year probe\n\nInvestigators spent the next three years going through paperwork at the company and, in October 2016, were satisfied that they had a case - not just on Compassionate Homecare - but 11 other Medicaid providers as well.\n\nThe investigators discovered that Compassionate Homecare had made millions of dollars by recruiting patients who did not need any health-related services. The firm would, nevertheless, bill the State of Massachusetts for ‘treatment’ offered to these ‘patients’.\n\n“The company routinely and knowingly billed the state for services that had not been authorised by a doctor and, in several instances, altered records to make it look like patients denied care by doctors had been approved,” said investigators.\n\n“Additionally, the company billed the state for care it never provided to people who were already at inpatient facilities while, in some cases, forged doctors’ signatures after the physicians refused to authorise services,” they said.\n\nIn his defence, Mr Kimaru, through lawyer James Boumil Jr, claimed investigators refused to detail the allegations against him, prompting Compassionate Homecare to sue the State of Massachusetts, terming the allegations “utterly preposterous”.\n\nHe said the company had billed out more than $90 million since its inception, making the alleged $1 million claimed as fraudulent only seven per cent of its total earnings.\n\n“If you’re running a company on the basis of massive fraud, who would expect that?” asked the lawyer, adding that his client was a Kenyan orphan who became a US citizen after years of hard work in the US.\n\n“He loves his country, he loves his company,” Mr Boumil said. “He would be the last person in the world to commit a crime.”\n\nThe Department of Justice would, however, hear none of that. Mr Kimaru was immediately placed under arrest on the orders of State of Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who said it was unfortunate that the company stole money that was meant to provide healthcare for the poor.\n\nAlso arrested was the company’s chief operating officer, Wilberto Rodriguez (31) and an administrator, Deborah Giordano, 57. The three were each individually charged with three counts of medical assistance fraud and larceny.\n\n\"Compassionate Homecare either knew that it was submitting false claims for payment to Mass Health or recklessly disregarded its obligation to familiarise itself with the legal requirements, standards and procedures of the Medicaid programme,” the prosecution told the court.\n\n“Based on its unlawful billing, Compassionate Homecare received overpayments from Mass Health of at least $34 million,” said prosecutors.\n\nCornered, the three suspects, who had initially pleaded not guilty, offered to enter into a plea agreement with the US government in 2019. The plea agreement, which took another three years to be ratified due to complications created by Compassionate Homecare filing for bankruptcy in 2020, came into effect on March 29 this year.\n\nIn the agreement, Mr Kimaru and his company agreed to pay back to the American government $6.53 million in exchange for a two-year suspended sentence. He also agreed to pay $85,000 to his former 79 employees, who had been rendered jobless after the discovery of the fraud.\n\n“As recommended by Assistant Attorney General Kaushal V. Rana and Mr Kimaru's lawyer, S. James Boumil Jr, the judge suspended the jail sentence for two years, during which time Mr Kimaru will be on administrative probation,” said the US Department of Justice, following the agreement between the prosecution and the key suspect, Mr Kimaru.\n\n“Home health aides provide critical services to vulnerable populations, and they, like all workers, must be paid their earned wages in full and in accordance with our laws,” added the department in reference to Mr Kimaru’s workers.\n\nOn paper, it looked like a win for the US government. Authorities had managed to recover money stolen by one of the companies entrusted to provide medical assistance to the vulnerable in society.\n\nHowever, unknown to them, Faith Newton, Kimaru’s wife and one of the directors of Compassionate Homecare but who was never arrested as there was no direct link to her involvement in the fraud orchestrated by the company, was also involved in a similar but larger scam of her own.\n\nBy the time they realised this, years later, Ms Newton had stolen three times the $34 million her husband had stolen and laundered it through a network of Kenyans in the US who used the money to buy luxury cars and houses, including a $3.2 million nine-bedroom house.\n\n[email protected]\n\nNEXT: How Kimaru’s wife grew a bigger criminal empire than her husband’s after his arrest using the skills she learnt from him.

    "Why Odinga may not have been Kenya’s ideal leader": "By ANDREW BOMANI More by this Author\n\nRaila Odinga is without a shadow of doubt a colossus on the African continent. Any student of leadership in Africa can’t afford not to study what it is that makes him tick.\n\nAnd a most useful place to begin is Odinga’s voluminous autobiography from 2013 titled The Flame of Freedom, which the former Nigerian head of state, General Olusegon Obasanjo, was so complimentary about in his foreword writing: “Too much of what our children are taught in school about development and government is borrowed from societies that, socially and historically, have backgrounds very different from ours. There has, until now, been a shortage of accessible literature on home-grown leadership responses to uniquely African problems and challenges. That is why I would like to see many more African leaders from all sectors of national public and professional life put their career experiences on record, just as Raila has done.”\n\nAnd before Odinga’s autobiography was a biography by a Nigerian Professor, Babafemi Badejo, titled Raila Odinga: An Enigma in Kenyan Politics.\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary definition of enigma is “a mysterious or puzzling person or thing.”\n\nIt is precisely this intriguing characterisation of Odinga that I more broadly wish to explore in a manner that may well be at odds with what the good professor had in mind.\n\nInstructively, Odinga narrates in his autobiography how he went to extraordinary lengths to assist Nigeria get itself out of the nightmarish rule of General Sani Abacha.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“After the Addis meeting, I returned to Nairobi and gathered MPs, and we agreed to petition the Nigerian government and also the Kenyan government to put pressure on Abacha to release Obasanjo and others, including former president Abiola, who was still in prison. I drafted a petition to the Nigerian government, addressed it to Abacha, and collected the signature of 87 MPs. Some of them and I, along with representatives of the media, walked to the Nigerian high commission in Nairobi, where we handed in our petition, also forwarding copies to the office of the president and the ministry of foreign affairs.\n\nI wrote an article on the Nigerian situation that was published in the local press. In it, I said that what had occurred in Nigeria constituted a major setback to the democratisation in Africa, especially given Nigeria’s size and the strategic position it occupied in African affairs.”\n\nOn this “major setback” to the democratisation in Africa, Odinga deserved many accolades. Odinga would later not spare then-Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe in his intimidation of the MDC.\n\nBut in the interests of consistency, the million-dollar question is why then he chose to turn a blind eye to the horrific civil rights abuses that were occurring in neighbouring Tanzania under John Magufuli.\n\nAs it were, Odinga and Magufuli had a bosom friendship going back to their time as ministers in charge of the roads portfolio. In the years to come, Odinga found it befitting to even invite Magufuli to be one of the foreign guests at his ODM Congress.\n\nTo little surprise, the classically unhinged Magufuli broke all etiquette not only in his dressing but address too such that were it not for President Kibaki’s gentlemanly mien, a diplomatic crisis would have most likely broken out.\n\nAnd Odinga was thrilled upon the nomination in 2015 of Magufuli as a presidential candidate.\n\nWithin no time of Magufuli’s presidency, all the calamitous signs were apparent. An outspoken opposition MP, Tundu Lissu, was actually shot in broad daylight near the parliamentary precincts and had to be evacuated to a Nairobi hospital.\n\nMy forlorn expectation was that Odinga would have comforted the MP and then taken it upon himself to excoriate Magufuli through the Tanzania high commission in Nairobi or say African Union.\n\nThe work of statesmen is to speak out at the hour of calling even when it involves personal friends. For instance, in the lead-up to the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, Nelson Mandela condemned not only Bush but Blair of the UK.\n\nHe specifically said that Blair was “like the foreign minister of the US”. Blair was actually known to be on very good terms with Mandela but still Madiba called him out.\n\nAnd when as well Tanzania held the most farcical polls in its history in 2020, for a man who has cried foul so often, Odinga’s silence was deafening.\n\nI personally made a small appeal in November 2020 for Odinga and other Kenyans of goodwill to raise their voices during our darkest chapter.\n\nAs if this was not enough, it was most alarming how Odinga would classify Magufuli upon his death as someone schooled in the ‘ideals’ of Mwalimu Julius Nyerere.\n\nThe two are worlds apart and just to show their fundamental divergence, Nyerere believed in development that was people-centered above all else whereas Magufuli had his singular mind on transportation infrastructure.\n\nIn 1973, Nyerere wrote: “Every country in Africa can show examples of modern facilities which...are now rotting unused. We have schools, irrigation works, expensive markets and so on by which someone came and tried to ‘bring development to the people’. If real development is to take place, the people have to be involved...for development means the development of the people. Roads, buildings, the increase of crop output are not development; they are only the tools of development.\n\nA new road extends a man’s freedom only if he travels upon it.”\n\nAnd upon Nyerere’s demise in 1999, the former president of the World Bank, James Wolfensohn, aptly captured his essence: “While world economists were debating the importance of capital output ratios, President Nyerere was saying nothing was more important for people than being able to read and write and have access to clean water.”\n\nIt was my earnest wish that Odinga could have found it worthwhile to go through the findings of the report of the South Commission chaired by Nyerere after stepping down as president. It elaborated on freedom in a manner which was completely at variance with the manner of Magufuli’s rule that bore all the hallmarks of fascism. Even Tanzanian women were on the receiving end of humiliating language that was in contrast to Nyerere’s progressive outlook going back to his Makerere University days when he won an award for an essay on women.\n\nTo cap it all, Nyerere during Tanzania’s war with Uganda under Amin, refused any monetary compensation for the release of the Libyan prisoners of wars captured going to strengthen Amin’s forces. Now then consider Magufuli’s remarks in the presence of the World Food Programme representative to Tanzania, ‘that our nation must seek to profit from the fighting nations nearby as even if it is wrong, those people will still fight anyway.’\n\nWhat a shame to humanity it was to have such a Neanderthal in the highest office!\n\nHad Odinga chosen to put Magufuli on the carpet, the international community would certainly have taken serious note.\n\nAnd electorally Odinga would have definitely strengthened his own credentials for president of Kenya. One undeniable challenge that Odinga faced against President Ruto was that he was a man of the past; and that the young voters were less concerned with his history of liberation but rather their own pockets.\n\nThis was true to a point which is why it was of utmost importance that a powerful message be sent to the citizenry that the region is not out of the woods on the democratic front. An unstable neighbour is bad for everyone.\n\nIn sum, the ways of Odinga match perfectly with the enigma epithet. At the heart of it though is a leader of double standards.\n\nTo illustrate the double standards, one has to go back to the Moi succession race of 2002. This was an epoch-making moment for the country that had to be gotten right. Following the 2017 nullification of the presidential election, Odinga’s camp played on the court ruling that the process was a mess. Yet in 2002, a very sound formula was suggested by the late presidential hopeful Hon. Simeon Nyachae for arriving at the name of the candidate to be fronted by the opposition parties against KANU. There had been big divisions before that.\n\nThe formula was given wide berth by Odinga. In addition, Nyachae had also stated in no uncertain terms that his intention if elected was to serve Kenyans for only a single term and hand over then to a younger person.\n\nThat he would be a transitional head of state. Now this year Raila through some of his supporters were preaching that if ‘Baba’ were elected, it would mark a ‘Mandela moment’.\n\nYou only ask yourself then why he didn’t give a chance to Nyachae, who not only came from a minority tribe that would have been very important for the ethnic cohesion of the country, but was also extremely competent such that Kenya would have in my estimation attained dizzying levels of efficiency.\n\nOne can only imagine how meritorious the civil service would have been under Nyachae.\n\nOdinga would totally out of the blue arrogate himself supernatural powers by declaring at a rally ‘Kibaki tosha’ (Kibaki is enough) such that Nyachae’s fate was sealed at that moment. It was a fait accompli in other words.\n\nOn the strength of this, my reason for Odinga pulling the rug from under Nyachae’s feet is that he knew Nyachae was nerves of steel and as a result as president wouldn’t give into his publicity stunts.\n\nIn the final analysis, Raila’s double standards are what made him chicken out of the presidential debate with Ruto.\n\nHe met his match and undoubtedly lost critical votes in the process. It was a blot on one’s escutcheon. Indeed it is not for nothing that a former spokesperson for former UN secretary-general Koffi Annan as well as Odinga himself, Salim Lone, only in July this year observed the following on Ruto before he fell out with Odinga: “I thought he was one of the sharpest, most focused leaders at that time, despite some troubling weaknesses.”",
    "Uhuru Kenyatta failed to turn Kenya into as big an international player as he could – here’s why": "One of the notable achievements of Uhuru Kenyatta’s nine-year tenure as president was that he invigorated Kenya’s foreign policy.\n\nA year after his 2013 inauguration, his government launched a document that outlined Kenya’s diplomatic engagements and foreign relations. It was the country’s first written foreign policy since independence.\n\nIts themes can be distilled into four objectives and practices: regional and continental cooperation; promoting Kenya’s economic interests; revival of pan-Africanism; and an aggressive approach to foreign policy, including a plethora of high-level visits.\n\nIt was indeed a dynamic performance.\n\nNevertheless, in my view, based on the country’s mixed outcomes and foreign policy losses, it’s evident that the Kenyatta government’s foreign policy was not focused, consistent or effectively coordinated. Consequently, it failed to create a regional balance of power favourable to Kenya’s interests.\n\nAnd while the country became more visible globally and actively engaged in international matters, the returns from this visibility have been dismal – save for an increased debt burden.\n\nRegional and continental cooperation\n\nIn the 2014 Kenya Foreign Policy document, Kenyatta affirmed that Kenya would seek to promote sub-regional and regional integration.\n\nIn his inauguration speech in 2013, he said his government would strengthen regional ties through the free movement of people, goods and investment. He underscored the importance of deepening relations with the East African Community and Africa as a whole to:\n\ndeliver on the promise of independence and liberation from our colonial past.\n\nHowever, critics faulted Kenyatta for using a pan-African approach to overcome the initial global isolation and non-receptiveness Kenya faced from traditional allies like Britain and the US. This chilly reception from the UK and US followed Kenyatta’s election as president despite his facing an International Criminal Court (ICC) case.\n\nAs a result, the president’s policy on global politics retracted to operating through the continental body, the African Union.\n\nKenya became an active contributor to the union’s programmes. In 2014, the country gave US$1.1 million to support the African World Heritage Fund.\n\nIn 2015, Kenyatta was elected the chairperson of the African Peer Review Mechanism. This is a voluntary assessment and monitoring system that evaluates and advises African Union member states on their progress in achieving good governance.\n\nMoreover, Kenya was among the countries that contributed troops to the African Union Mission in Somalia.\n\nDespite all this activity, Kenyatta failed to effectively exert influence and drive regional integration to Kenya’s advantage.\n\nPan-Africanism\n\nA notable element in Kenya’s foreign policy under Kenyatta was the renaissance of pan-Africanism. In his first address to the African Union Summit in 2013, he said:\n\nPan-Africanism has sparked a Kenyan renaissance.\n\nThe president said he had received tutelage on pan-Africanism from his father, Jomo Kenyatta, Kenya’s first president.\n\nArguably, this pan-African reinvigoration into Kenya’s foreign policy was motivated by the existential threats of global sanctions that the regime faced. Yet, Kenyatta’s election against the backdrop of the cases at The Hague turned Kenya into an icon of resistance following what was perceived as the unfair targeting of Africa by the ICC.\n\nDuring Kenyatta’s inauguration, Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni praised Kenyans for rejecting western neo-colonialism. This was in reference to calls by diplomats that Kenyans should not elect people with cases to answer at the ICC.\n\nThe African Union convened an extraordinary summit that declared support for Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto, who was also facing charges at The Hague.\n\nEconomic interests\n\nKenyatta’s foreign policy of economic prosperity was pursued and achieved via a triple approach.\n\nFirst was through encouraging trade ties with traditional allies like the UK, US and some countries in western Europe. Second was through a diversification of economic relations to include new markets in the form of a “look east” policy.\n\nThird was through emphasising intra-African trade. Kenya signed trade agreements with states not considered traditional allies, such as Nigeria and Ghana. Additionally, the country quickly signed the African Continental Free Trade Area agreement in March 2018.\n\nBut questions have arisen on whether Kenya has the financial capacity to meet present and future economic obligations.\n\nAssertive foreign policy\n\nKenya hosted a wide range of high-level international meetings. Subjects ranged from climate change to trade. Kenyatta also received high-level delegations reminiscent of former president Daniel Moi’s era. His guests included the pope and leaders of India, Israel, US, UK, China and Japan.\n\nFrom Africa, Kenyatta hosted leaders from Ghana, Ethiopia, Somalia, Uganda and Rwanda, among many others.\n\nBy July 2022, a month to the election that would end his term in office, Kenyatta had made 158 official foreign trips. In contrast, his predecessor Mwai Kibaki made just 33 foreign trips over 10 years of leadership.\n\nThe country’s foreign policy during Kenyatta’s second term, which began in 2017, is what I would describe as aggressive or assertive. The country took advantage of any international opportunity that arose to make its mark.\n\nIn February 2022, Kenya addressed a UN Security Council meeting on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Its envoy to the UN, Martin Kimani, came out strongly in defence of Ukraine. He stated that the Charter of the United Nations was fading due to “the relentless assault of the powerful”. Kimani compared Ukraine’s plight to Africa’s colonial legacy.\n\nKenya’s aggressive foreign policy direction earned Kenya a seat at the UN Security Council as a non-permanent member.\n\nBut this aggressive foreign policy also portrayed Kenya as a nation that “wants everything”. This earned it some opposition regionally. For instance, states like Uganda, Burundi, Djibouti and Tanzania didn’t vote for Kenya in its bid to chair the African Union Commission.\n\nKenyatta should have streamlined his priorities and made his foreign objectives sharper so as not to appear to be a “Jack of all trades” in foreign affairs. Many foreign interests were projected with little coordination; few were accomplished.\n\nIn some cases, the country’s goodwill was squandered in the pursuit of self-interest.\n\nWhat next?\n\nThe post-Kenyatta government needs to fast-track the realisation of East African Community objectives. It needs to support South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo’s active participation in regional integration. The new Ruto regime should also maintain a non-disruptive relationship with Rwanda and Tanzania.\n\nIn the Horn of Africa, Kenya needs to diplomatically endeavour to reduce Ethiopia’s growing influence in the leadership of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development.\n\nUnder Kenyatta, Kenya’s foreign policy practice within the African Union was more “lone ranger”. The Ruto regime will need to forge closer ties with regional powers like Egypt, Nigeria and South Africa to make it easier for Kenya to push through its agenda at the African Union.\n\nIt will also need to renegotiate its foreign debts and re-examine Kenya-China agreements to re-organise debt repayments.",
    "Kenya’s Polisario Snub Reveals Morocco’s Growing Clout in Africa": "",
    "What Next for Kenya?": "On Monday, Kenya’s Supreme Court resoundingly rejected challenges to the August 9 election, affirming the victory of William Ruto and his United Democratic Alliance. Shortly thereafter, outgoing Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta broke his long silence about the electoral outcome. Although Ruto was Kenyatta’s Deputy President, Kenyatta had supported Raila Odinga for the presidency, and his displeasure with the electoral outcome was clear. Addressing Kenyans, he promised a smooth transfer of power, but repeatedly urged citizens to “scrutinize the coherence” of the truth presented by institutions like the judiciary.\n\nIt might have done Kenya’s democracy more good if Kenyatta had couched his vision of civic duty not in suspicion of a judiciary that appears to have made an unbiased decision based on the facts, but rather in a call for greater civic engagement committed to holding new leadership accountable for its actions, regardless of how one voted. The Kenyan election is decided, but the jury is still out on what Ruto’s victory will mean for Kenya’s fight against corruption, which lands second only to the economy on the list of priorities Kenyan citizens identified for Afrobarometer. Ruto cast himself as a champion of the working class interested in fighting “state capture,” but his history suggests he is an unlikely anti-corruption champion. His running mate, Deputy President-elect Rigathi Gachagua, has faced serious corruption charges, and was recently ordered to forfeit nearly $1.7 million dollars in what a court determined were ill-gotten gains. Equally unpredictable is just what a Ruto administration will mean for human rights and the rule of law. It’s worth remembering that the International Criminal Court (ICC) declined to acquit him on charges of crimes against humanity relating to the post-election violence of 2007 and 2008 when the case fell apart largely due to witness tampering.\n\nWhat is no longer in question is the frustration with the status quo on display in Kenya and elsewhere on the continent. Ruto was perceptive in harnessing popular dissatisfaction with Kenyatta’s government, emphasizing Odinga’s close association with the incumbent in this last electoral cycle to characterize himself as an outsider and his ascension from deputy president to president as a breath of fresh air. Across the region, demands for change are diminishing the advantages of incumbency and challenging conventional political wisdom. Even in Angola, a country in which it has long been difficult to distinguish between the ruling party and the state itself, last month’s elections were far closer than any the country has experienced before, despite the substantial capacity of the government to tilt the playing field to its advantage.\n\nAfrica in Transition Michelle Gavin and other experts track political and security developments across sub-Saharan Africa.

But it will be equally important to continue supporting Kenya’s civil society, democratic resilience, and the connective tissue of accountability between the governing and the governed. The disappointing voter turnout numbers in Kenya suggest that many citizens simply did not believe that the electoral outcome mattered much, or that any of their choices offered a compelling vision for the country’s future. But democracies require constant vigilance. Should the new administration find it harder to deliver change than to promise it, it will take an organized and energized public to ensure the Kenyan people retain their capacity to choose leadership that meets the moment.\n\nThis publication is part of the Diamonstein-Spielvogel Project on the Future of Democracy.",

    "Kenya’s new move on SGR to upset China and Uganda": "By Allan Olingo More by this Author\n\nBy ANTHONY KITIMO More by this Author\n\nThis week’s order by Kenyan President William Ruto to revert cargo clearing services to the port of Mombasa could upset China and Uganda, the port’s biggest clients, and trigger anxiety among major players who depend on it.\n\nThe order, issued as President Ruto took office, is set to have far-reaching ramifications.\n\nThe key question is what China’s reaction will be, given that Kenya must still meet its end of the bargain on the standard gauge railway (SGR) cargo operation numbers and debt repayments.\n\nBut more importantly, will be whether port operations’ efficiency that has currently seen goods reach Uganda in a record four days after being offloaded at the Mombasa port will continue. The shortened time was due to the seamless systems that directly fed the SGR, and onwards to the Nairobi Inland Container depot and the Naivasha dry port.\n\nKenya’s move also comes as neighbour Tanzania steps up its efforts to connect the Dar es Salaam port with other East African countries through the Central Corridor.\n\nSpeaking on Tuesday in his first address to the nation after his swearing-in as the fifth president of Kenya, President Ruto defended his move to undo the policy of his predecessor Uhuru Kenyatta.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said his actions were aimed at restoring thousands of jobs that had been lost in the logistics sector in Mombasa when former president Kenyatta issued an order for all cargo coming through the port of Mombasa to be hauled by the SGR, and cleared at either Nairobi or the Naivasha Inland Container Depot (ICD).\n\n“This afternoon, I will be issuing instructions for clearance of all goods and other attendant operational issues to revert to the port of Mombasa. This restores thousands of jobs in the city of Mombasa,” said President Ruto on Tuesday. But even as cargo operations are ordered back to Mombasa, the question now is how Kenya will repay the SGR loan considering that the repayments will more than double in the financial year starting this July, when there will be increased payment of principal sums to the Exim Bank of China for the project.\n\nExim Bank of China funded 90 per cent of the $3.6 billion line from Nairobi to Mombasa.\n\nAlso Read: Mombasa Port: How Kenya’s auditor-general misread China’s Standard Gauge Railway contracts\n\nKenya’s Treasury projects debt repayments to Exim Bank of China will rise to $800 million in the next financial year, a 126.61 per cent surge from the revised $351.7 million budgeted for this year. Redemptions to the Chinese lender will increase to $605.16 million, from $174.98 million this year. Interest obligations will rise 8.55 per cent to $191.88 million, from 176.7 million, according to Treasury data tabled in the National Assembly.\n\nSet volumes\n\nAccording to the take-and-pay agreement, the Kenya Ports Authority undertook to consign to Kenya Railways a set volume of freight and cargo in order to collect adequate funds to pay off the SGR loan.\n\nAccording to the latest data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, in the first six months of this year, SGR recorded a total of $750 million in revenue. Some $610 million was for cargo volumes with revenue for the past five years totalling $4.6 billion. Passenger revenues were $760 million over the same period, an indication that SGR depends on freight to remain afloat.\n\nIn December 2019, then-president Kenyatta flagged off a cargo train from Nairobi to Naivasha, marking the start of operations at the Inland Container Depot. Soon after, he issued an order to evacuate onward cargo to Naivasha.\n\nKenyatta’s administration forced importers to use the SGR to ensure minimum guaranteed business to repay the $3.7 billion debt taken to build it. The directive saw the government transfer goods clearance to Naivasha, and enforced compliance, affecting thousands of workers and companies in the logistics sector in Mombasa.\n\nThe move was met by protests from Uganda and South Sudan, which are the main transit users of Mombasa port. They said then that Naivasha lacked adequate cargo handling facilities, thus making the cost of transport to their respective countries more expensive.\n\nProtests\n\nLong-distance cargo transporters also protested the directive, saying the government’s move would raise the cost of doing business, with the costs passed on to the final consumers of the imported goods. They moved to the High Court to have the mandatory directive rescinded and succeeded, but the government, through the KPA, appealed and the directive stood.\n\nTo date, an appeal challenging orders quashing the directive requiring all cargo to be transported to Nairobi and the hinterland exclusively through the SGR is yet to be determined by the Court of Appeal.\n\nLast November, the appellate court suspended the execution of orders quashing the directive issued by a five-judge bench of the High Court, pending hearing and determination of the appeal filed by the KPA.\n\nKPA argued that the directives were meant to operationalise the take-and-pay agreement, which is key to ensuring the loan for the construction of the SGR is repaid without any hitches.\n\nIn his campaign rallies in the run-up to the presidential election, Dr Ruto harped on the fact that the transfer of port operations to Naivasha was against the agreement made during the conception and construction of the SGR.\n\nPresident Ruto said the Naivasha dry port was put up to benefit a few individuals, and dealt a blow to the economy of Mombasa.\n\nContrary order\n\nBut as the new order to revert cargo clearance to Mombasa takes effect, stakeholders now say it will be a blow to East African countries that use the port, and is contrary to the contract between Kenya and China on how to pay the loan.\n\n“With the latest move by the current government, this means the Naivasha ICD where five EAC countries were last month issued with title deeds by former president Kenyatta, might cease to be lucrative. This means, the investment at the dry port, a facility on more than 1,000 acres, which is estimated to handle two million tonnes of cargo every year, will go to waste,” said Simon Sang, secretary-general of the Dock Workers Union.\n\n“We are asking the government to invest more in Malaba and Busia borders to reduce congestion considering heavy traffic expected in the coming months,” he added.\n\nMost of the cargo handled at the Mombasa port is destined for Uganda, Rwanda, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo, which accounts for 30 percent of imports and exports through there.\n\nLast month, Kenya concluded the issuance of title deeds to five countries -- Burundi, Rwanda, DR Congo, Uganda and South Sudan -- to establish dry ports in Naivasha, despite their earlier reluctance to use the dry port as an alternative to Mombasa.\n\nThen-president Kenyatta hosted the title deeds handing-out ceremony in Naivasha, where a special economic zone is being established. Uganda and South Sudan were offered land at the dry port in 2019, and since then have done little by way of putting up the necessary infrastructure such as cargo handling operations because of lack of a title deed as proof of ownership.\n\nEvacuating cargo\n\nAs the President Ruto directive is implemented, shippers say the seamless connectivity from the vessel to SGR to Nairobi or Naivasha reduced congestion, both at the port and also vehicular traffic along the Northern Corridor.\n\nThe Shippers Council of Eastern Africa (SCEA) chief executive Gilbert Lagat said the SGR idea was to fully connect port and border towns. This would be via both the SGR and metre gauge railway (MGR) to minimise costs.\n\nMr Lagat said the SGR and MGR shortened the time taken to evacuate cargo from Mombasa to Malaba by 62 percent, and costs by 58 percent.\n\n“What importers consider is cost and efficiency. If the consignment reaches on time at the cheapest cost, that is what they will go for. The introduction of the railway is what we have been pushing for as it will give importers an alternative means of hauling their cargo considering bottlenecks associated with the Northern Corridor,” said Mr Lagat.\n\nHe added that the new railway had reduced cases of cargo loss as there is less diversion than is experienced with trucks.\n\nThe order by President Ruto will also derail Kenya Railway Corporation’s move to improve efficiency by connecting Mombasa and Malaba via rail. Starting this January, cargo from Mombasa port destined for Malaba was to be loaded onto the SGR to Naivasha, from where it would be transshipped onto the MGR line at the Naivasha ICD.\n\nFaster by rail\n\nThe freight train and connectivity, if successfully implemented, will take less than 40 hours to ferry cargo from Mombasa to Malaba railway yard compared with by road transport which takes 96 hours. It would also offer a cost reduction to $860 from $2,000 per container charged by road hauliers.\n\nAlso by collecting goods from the Naivasha ICD, importers from neighbouring countries will have reduced the distance covered by road hauliers by more than 400 kilometres.\n\nKenya chose to rehabilitate its 100-year old MGR from Naivasha to Malaba after it abandoned its bid to extend the SGR line to Kisumu, and on to the Ugandan border, after failing to secure a multibillion-shilling loan from China, which had funded the first and second phases of the SGR line.\n\nKenya Railway managing director Philip Mainga had said that the freight train has the capacity to handle 120,000 containers annually.\n\nIn December 2021, KRC gazetted promotional charges to haul cargo from Mombasa to Malaba at $860 for 20-foot container weighing up to 30 tonnes, while that above that cost $960. A 40-foot container above 30 tonnes was charged at $1,100, and those above were charged $1,260 without considering last mile cost. Since 2019, after the introduction of SGR freight train, transporters and container freight owners have been counting losses as all cargo ended up on the freight train to Nairobi and Naivasha.\n\nAs a result, container freight stations, which handled up to 95 percent of the cargo offloaded at Mombasa, were left to manage less than 10 percent of Mombasa-destined cargo.\n\nJob losses\n\nAccording to the Container Freight Stations Association (CFSA), more than 4,000 workers lost their jobs since the launch of the SGR and introduction of the mandatory haulage of cargo by train to Nairobi and Naivasha ICDs.\n\n“We had to let go more than half our workers as businesses struggle. All these job losses have happened at the Mombasa port as a result of the reduction in trucked cargo volumes,” said CFSA chief executive Daniel Nzeki.\n\nKenya Transporters Association condemned the government’s move to force importers to use the SGR saying it does not want to tell the public the hidden costs of using the cargo train to ferry containers.\n\n“It costs $860 including value added tax to transport a 20-foot container to and from Nairobi using a truck but the SGR costs more than $920,” said KTA chairman Newton Wang’oo.\n\nKenya International Forwarding and Warehousing Association chairman Roy Mwanthi echoed Mr Wang’oo’s sentiments, saying they now expect business to return to normal.\n\n“The move by President Ruto is commended and now we want the executive order to be implemented immediately,” said Mr Mwanthi.\n\nHe added that the Naivasha Inland Container depot will remain a futuristic spot, and that “the government facilities should be left open to those willing to use them, and the government should make them efficient”.",
    "Saudi remittances to Kenya double to $187m amid maids abuse": "By CONSTANT MUNDA More by this Author\n\nSaudi Arabia has emerged as the fastest-growing source of remittances, pointing to increasing migration of jobless Kenyan workers despite cases of abuse and cruel treatment of foreign domestic workers in the Middle East nation.\n\nFresh official data — based on cash flows through formal channels — indicate that diaspora remittances from Saudi Arabia have more than doubled in the past two years.\n\nStatistics from the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) show Ksh22.65 billion ($187 million) was sent back home by Kenyans living in Saudi Arabia in the first eight months of the year.\n\nThis ranks the Gulf nation as the third-largest source of remittances for Kenya behind the United Kingdom (Ksh25.4 billion/ $209.8 million) and the United States (Ksh188.8 billion/ $1.5 billion).\n\nThe inflows have grown by three-quarters compared with $107.99 million in the same period last year, and represents a 144.35 percent climb over $77.26 million in 2020— marking the fastest growth over the period.\n\nSaudi Arabia relies on millions of low-paid foreign workers such as housemaids, care-givers, nannies, drivers and security guards, who send money to their families back home every year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore than 30 percent of the oil-rich kingdom’s population of 35 million are migrants, many from Asian and African countries.\n\nBut Saudi Arabia - like other Gulf nations such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman - has long faced criticism from rights groups for its visa-sponsorship system that leaves migrant workers open to abuse and exploitation.\n\nDomestic workers are often kept under lock and key by their employers, forced to work more than 18 hours a day, deprived of food and wages and physically and sexually abused, activists say.\n\nCBK data indicate the remittances from Saudi Arabia are on course to surpass cash wired from the UK, having overtaken South Africa that has been the second-largest source of money transfer from Kenyans working abroad. Foreign Affairs principal secretary Macharia Kamau told MPs that over 100,000 Kenyans engaged in non-domestic work in Saudi Arabia.\n\n“Countries like Saudi Arabia, their traditions around house work are very ‘ancient’ so you find people who suffer terrible beatings and abuse are usually house helps,” Mr Kamau said.\n\n“In that same country where we have over 100,000 Kenyans working in different capacities, hotels, taxis, they have no problem. So we have to ask ourselves if we are exporting the right category of personnel and do they have the right capacity and training to understand that culture.”\n\nVisa-sponsorship rules known as the kafala system in the Gulf countries tie migrant workers to their employer and they cannot change jobs or leave the country without permission.\n\nThis has led to widespread abuse of migrant workers -- from passport confiscation to unpaid wages and excessive work hours, beatings and even rape by male members of the household.\n\nKenyan authorities have come under intense pressure to put in place measures to protect citizens fleeing joblessness in an economy struggling to create jobs for its growing youthful population.\n\nIn the Ksh3.3 trillion ($27.2 billion) budget for this financial year ending June 2023, lawmakers approved a Ksh374 million ($3 million) expenditure to build a safe house in Saudi Arabia’s capital, Riyadh, to give refuge to Kenyan workers facing abuse in that country.\n\nDiaspora remittances from Saudi Arabia hit a monthly record of $26.6 million compared with $16.56 million in the same month last year and $10.43 million in August 2020.\n\nThat has cemented its place as the third-largest source of the cash sent back home by Kenyans abroad, behind the US and the UK whose inflows have been softening on the back of decades-high inflation which has eaten into earnings.\n\nInflows from Kenyans living in the US grew at a slower rate of 12.17 percent in the eight-month period to $1.565 billion, while the UK’s dropped 11.10 percent to Ksh25.44 billion ($210 million).\n\nOverall, remittances grew 11.44 percent year-over-year in the January-August 2022 period to $2.67 billion, consolidating its position as Kenya’s top forex earner ahead of tea exports, tourist receipts and horticultural exports.\n\nPresident William Ruto has pledged to create a ministry to address issues affecting Kenya’s diaspora when he forms government in the coming days.\n\n“The focus has been on remittances, while their fundamental rights as citizens have been neglected,” Dr Ruto said on September 13. “To correct this oversight, I pledge to elevate diaspora issues at a ministry level.”\n\n[email protected]",

    "DARIUS OKOLLA - The Myth That Is Plastic Waste Recycling in Kenya": "Brexit Britain’s dismal plan to export its “immigration problem” to Rwanda through the forced deportation of asylum seekers is in some ways redolent of how, more than a century earlier, Kenya Colony dealt with its “native question”. That centred upon how to control the “natives” in a white European colony.\n\nSome of the same buzzwords can be heard again this time around. Morality, betterment, economics, labour, containment, segregation and deterrence. Africans (and migrants of other ethnicities) must be contained in the equivalent of “native” reserves so that states can better control them. Moving them into reserves (aka migrant hostels, barracks, camps or detention centres) is for their own good. They will learn to give up whatever they were doing and labour for the white man (or in Rwanda’s case, industrious black and brown people). They will learn by example to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, as if they had never worked hard before. They will be mighty grateful for the opportunities offered – or they damn well ought to be. Saviours, of whatever colour, will save the lazy “natives” from themselves – or in the case of cross-Channel migrants, from people smugglers. Morally, it is the right thing to do. Civilisation will rub off on them. But whether the deported migrants will be treated as citizens or subjects in their new “home” remains unclear.\n\nWriting in The Times in April, the then Home Secretary Priti Patel, chief architect of the UK-Rwanda deportation scheme, said, “We can provide legal, safe, orderly and controlled ways for people to better their lives, flee oppression, persecution or conflict and enjoy new opportunities” (emphasis mine). This ignores the fact that forced deportation is itself oppressive, and a form of trafficking. The “best interests” argument was regularly used by colonial administrators, in Kenya and in other British colonies, to justify forced removals and other oppressive measures against Africans, such as the Maasai removals and the Talai resettlement (discussed below).\n\nContinuities in the colonial treatment of mobile Africans, and the modern-day treatment of refugees and asylum seekers (both African and other non-whites), are plain to see. Scholars Hanna Brankamp and Patricia Daley write of labourers, migrants and refugees, then and now: “Colonial biopolitics dictated that nonwhite bodies only move at the behest of capital, colonial authorities, and certainly never of their own volition”. Discussing both colonial migrant labourers and post-colonial refugees and migrants, and historical trajectories of migration control, their term “racialized subjects in need of spatial fixation” is a useful one. They draw parallels between measures of regulation, control and containment that are still in vogue today.\n\nThe role of Brexit\n\nThe goal of ending unfettered immigration to Britain lay at the heart of the Brexit vote in 2016, when a slim majority of British people voted to leave the European Union (EU). Those voters, known as Brexiteers, seem to forget that 47.5 million people did not vote to leave. Though this figure includes 13 million people who did not vote at all, those who voted to stay in the EU are called Remainers. The country formally left the EU in January 2020. But Brexiteers are furious that Brexit has not delivered what they expected, or were promised. In particular, they rage at what they see as out-of-control immigration, and the spectre of “hordes” of young men “of fighting age” from Africa and the Middle East arriving on our beaches. The majority are wrongly assumed to be Muslims, who are believed, in the wake of several terrorist attacks by young Muslim men living in Britain, to pose a terror threat. Immigration, especially by cross-Channel dinghy from France, aided by people smugglers, has soared under successive Tory governments; 28,500 migrants crossed the Channel this way in the past year, treble the figure for the previous 12 months. More than 20,000 people have crossed since the start of 2022. Crossings have continued since the Home Office announced its deportation plan, which indicates that it is not a deterrent. Some 1295 people crossed in one day (22 August), a record for 2022 so far. The fact that the migrants are escorted ashore by Border Force officials, housed in hotels, fed and watered, and “paid” £39 a week, all at taxpayers’ expense, only infuriates Brexiteers more.\n\n“Colonial biopolitics dictated that nonwhite bodies only move at the behest of capital, colonial authorities, and certainly never of their own volition”.\n\nGloating over this fiasco is the divisive figure of Nigel Farage, an éminence grise obsessed with immigration and the EU, who has never managed to get elected to the British parliament, despite seven attempts. He was, nonetheless, the driving force behind Brexit, when leader of the fringe UKIP (UK Independence Party) and Brexit Party. Farage continues to whip up anti-migrant sentiment on right-wing broadcast channels such as GB News, but also in the pages of serious national newspapers. If one person is single-handedly responsible for the anti-migrant rhetoric, it is Farage. Shamefully, the two final candidates who fought to succeed Boris Johnson as Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss, parroted Farage in their frantic attempt to appeal to Tory Party members who chose the new PM. As predicted, Truss won. (The British electorate as a whole was not allowed to vote.) At an earlier stage of the contest, all the candidates said they supported the Rwanda deportation plan – despite the fact that several of them are, like Patel and Sunak, the children of immigrants to the UK. (Sunak’s parents were born in Kenya and Tanganyika, Patel’s are from Uganda.)\n\nFear of a mass invasion by Africans features in much of this rhetoric. Online comments contain hysterical claims that “the whole continent” is headed for Europe. “Most of Africa would prefer to live in Britain”, posted a reader at the Daily Telegraph on 22 June, one example that stands for many. In fact, the top countries of migrants’ origin include non-African countries such as Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Albania, Myanmar and Vietnam.\n\nThe deportation plan can be seen as the culmination of the Tories’ hostile environment policy towards immigrants, which was first introduced ten years ago. In 2012, the then Home Secretary, Theresa May, announced a strategy aimed at tackling “illegal” immigration by making life so unbearable for certain migrants they would voluntarily choose to leave. May herself used the words “a really hostile environment”. (Ironically, she now criticises the Rwanda deportation policy.) However, the opposition Labour Party first coined the expression in 2007. The then Labour immigration minister Liam Byrne referred to the desirability of creating a “hostile environment” in a consultation document that year, although the policy was not implemented. He has angrily denied May’s claims that Labour invented it.\n\nMigration within colonial Kenya\n\nSwitching my focus to Kenya and the deeper historical context of forced migration, many of the internal relocations that took place in colonial Kenya (and the British protectorate that preceded it, before 1920) involved coercing Africans into leaving home to labour for white settlers. They moved seasonally in large numbers. “Squatters had not looked for work; [Lord Delamere] had sent for them, fetching their families and flocks by train”, writes historian John Lonsdale. However, not all displacement was coerced; this denies African and Asian agency, and overlooks all the other reasons why men, and women (often ignored in migration studies), moved as individuals in search of work.\n\nThe deportation plan can be seen as the culmination of the Tories’ hostile environment policy towards immigrants, which was first introduced ten years ago.\n\nNorman Leys (a medical doctor and rights activist) reported how many colonial district officers initially refused to comply with demands from settlers and other private employers to use their influence and procure labourers. “Then an agitation began in Nairobi and in London. As a result of that agitation instructions were sent to district officers that, while no compulsion was to be used, ‘moral suasion’ was to be resorted to, chiefs were to be ‘encouraged’ to persuade their people to leave home to work for Europeans.” Then as now, Anglican bishops issued a statement condemning the plan. “We believe that ideally all labour should be voluntary. We recognise that, at present, this is impossible … [But] we are of the opinion that compulsory labour, so long as it is clearly necessary, should be definitely legalised.”\n\nUnder colonial vagrancy laws, it even became impossible for Africans who were not in employment to move around the country. The raising of the hut and poll tax also “encouraged” (Leys’ word, he was being ironic) Africans to seek wage labour outside their home areas. Settler estates depended on African labour to function, but recruitment proved difficult. Some settlers resorted to “exceptional violence” in order to get labour, in the words of scholars Bruce Berman and John Lonsdale. “The ferocity and unpredictability of the settler assault on the African population threatened to undermine the whole apparatus of colonial control”. The state had to step in to control labour supply, and did so after World War I when mass forced conscription into the Carrier Corps was seen to have been a “success”. (Some success; 95,000 African porters died.) It was a matter of carrots but more often sticks, as this appalling statement exemplifies:\n\nI always treat my natives the same as I treat my children, I try to be kind to them, and to advise and direct them, but when kindness has no effect you have to do the same as they do in the public schools at home and throughout the empire – cane them. (Lt. Col. J.G. Kirkwood, Legislative Council member, Legco debate, 28 November 1941).\n\nThe language of infantilization persists today in the narratives around migrants.\n\nAlthough the state, including the railway, was the largest single employer in the country at this point, thousands of men moved seasonally between the settler estates and African reserves, where their families tended to remain on the land. But over time, whole families moved to live on settler estates as squatters, and were initially allowed to bring their cattle with them. They grew subsistence crops, while women and children also provided labour to settlers during peak harvest and planting times. By 1931, the number of squatters in the highlands had risen to 113,176, the majority Kikuyu. They occupied one million acres of settler land, some of it land that the Maasai had formerly occupied. Although this arrangement brought some benefits for squatters (for one, it allowed them to expand beyond crowded Kikuyuland, creating a toe-hold that lasts to this day), harsh new laws forced African compliance with government. One of the most hated was the Registration of Natives Ordinance of 1915, which forced all males over the age of 15 to carry a form of identity called the kipande.\n\nOver time, settlers became alarmed about the large number of squatter stock on their land, and fearing the diseases that this stock allegedly carried, began forcing squatters and their stock off farms. Resentment at this was among the issues that sowed the seeds of Mau Mau (aka the Land and Freedom Army). “The squatters saw their economic deprivation as linked to their political subordination and it was these two problems that they hoped to eradicate when they took the oath and swore to support the Mau Mau movement,” wrote Tabitha Kanogo in her ground-breaking book Squatters and the Roots of Mau Mau.\n\nMaasai and other forced moves\n\nSome communities were forcibly moved in their thousands, to become internally displaced in other parts of colonial Kenya. The most infamous forced migrations were the Maasai moves following two treaties or “agreements” made between Maasai leaders and British protectorate officials in 1904 and 1911. The moves were ordered to make way for white settlement, first in the central Rift Valley, later in the highlands of Laikipia. Maasai from certain socio-territorial sections (not the Maasai as a whole) were initially moved into two reserves, one in the north, the other in the south on the border with German territory (later Tanganyika and Tanzania). In 1904, the British promised the Maasai they could keep Laikipia for ever. But only seven years later, under pressure from settlers, they broke their pledge and moved the Maasai again, this time at gunpoint, into an enlarged southern reserve in what is now Narok County.\n\nIt is estimated that the Maasai lost up to at least 50 per cent of the territory they had once used, but the figure could be nearer 70 per cent. The losses did not just involve land, but included the loss of good grazing, access to water sources and sacred sites, and the fatal exposure of both humans and livestock to diseases like East Coast fever and malaria, which were unknown in Laikipia in those days. The ripple effects of these events continue to the present day, in agitation by Maasai for the return of lost land or compensation. Neither is likely to materialise, for a variety of reasons.\n\nThe language of infantilization persists today in the narratives around migrants.\n\nFears about Maasai warriors and the assumed threat they posed to Europeans in the early years of colonial rule were remarkably similar to the current rhetoric in Britain, centred on the irrational fear of “hordes of young men of fighting age” arriving on our shores. Not only is their potential (but unproven) violence feared, but also their perceived sexuality – “Lock up your daughters!” is the cry of the anti-migrant Tory right. This is obviously part of a larger racist trope, referred to as the “black peril” in the scholarship on settler colonies, but also prevalent in the USA, especially in the formerly segregated Deep South.\n\nBritish administrators saw the warriors as a dangerous standing army, which could let rip at any moment. In a discussion of the merits of confining the Maasai to reserves, Protectorate Commissioner Sir Charles Eliot (the equivalent of a governor) wrote to the Foreign Office in 1903: “[Maasai] simplicity, loyalty, and soldierlike qualities inspire a sympathy which makes people forget that a race which regards fighting and raiding as the only occupations for a young man of honour can never be anything but a dangerous race.” He also condemned the warriors’ alleged “immorality”. In fact, as other officials who knew the Maasai better than Eliot were constantly telling him, they had never attacked Europeans and posed no danger. “And they are not likely to,” wrote Deputy Commissioner Frederick Jackson, “so long as they are treated fairly”. On the contrary, several administrators sympathetic to the Maasai feared that racist South African settlers in the Rift Valley might attack the Maasai if they were not physically separated. For these and other reasons, they were forced into reserves.\n\nToday, the Maasai are not alone in their grievance with historical injustices. The Talai clan of Kericho County, part of the Kipsigis community, has for years sought reparations for forced resettlement. The British evicted them in 1934-36 from the Kipsigis Reserve to an allegedly mosquito-infested valley at Gwassi near Lake Victoria, where they stayed, under supervision, until the mid-1950s. They claim to have been moved to make way for tea plantations, some of which are still owned by UK-based multinationals. A group of Talai wrote to Prince William (elder son of King Charles III) in May this year seeking an apology and his support for reparations. The letter says: “We inherited the pain, you inherited the profit.” They hoped for sympathy from Will “because Kenya is special to him”. Earlier appeals to the British government appear to have received no reply.\n\nSome communities were forcibly moved in their thousands, to become internally displaced in other parts of colonial Kenya.\n\nHistorians who have researched Talai history, most particularly the role of ritual leaders or orkoiik, say there is in fact no evidence that the Talai were evicted from land that became tea estates. But they were certainly evicted under colonial laws, said one leading scholar, and “unquestionably have a case”. UN human rights rapporteurs investigated the case and found for the Talai in 2021, which the community hailed as a great victory. However, the UN may have “ordered” the British government to apologise and pay compensation, but that does not mean anything will happen. The Tory government has been a tad preoccupied since Prime Minister Boris Johnson was ousted, and a bitter struggle ensued to replace him. And since Prince William has no political power or influence, all he can say is pole sana.\n\nThe Rwanda scheme is becoming more bogged down by the day. It recently emerged that British ministers who backed the plan were warned months ago, by the government’s own advisor, that Rwanda tortures and kills political opponents. The government wants to keep these comments in a Foreign Office report secret, partly in order not to offend Rwanda. Media houses, including the BBC, are challenging this. The doomed flights are postponed until after a judicial review of the policy at the High Court, London, which began on 5 September and is expected to last five days. President Paul Kagame has also thrown a spanner in the works by announcing, after pocketing the £120 million down-payment, that Rwanda will only take 200 migrants – a drop in the ocean. Patel and the Home Office she previously headed (she resigned on Monday 5 September, hours after Truss’s victory) made a major mistake by not specifying, in the MoU with Rwanda, how many migrants Britain planned to deport. Some of us suspect that our government never intended to carry out the policy in the first place. It was simply red meat thrown to Brexit voters.\n\n–\n\nThis article is part of a series on migration and displacement in and from Africa, co-produced by the Elephant and the Heinrich Boll Foundation’s African Migration Hub, which is housed at its new Horn of Africa Office in Nairobi.",
    "Kenya clarifies position on Sahrawi after gaffe": "By AGGREY MUTAMBO More by this Author\n\nKenya says it has not abandoned a decades-old policy in which it supported the African Union’s call for free self-determination of the Sahrawi people.\n\nIn a diplomatic note sent to embassies and representatives offices of international organisations in Nairobi, Kenya walked back on a controversial tweet last week in which President William Ruto appeared to end recognition of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) in favour of an autonomy offer by Morocco.\n\nRead: Kenya pushes Western Sahara issue back on AU agenda\n\nInstead, Foreign Affairs Principal Secretary Macharia Kamau said Nairobi has not departed from supporting the African Union call, as well as mediation programmes under the UN, to have the people of Western Sahara decide their future.\n\n“Kenya’s position on the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic is fully aligned with the decision of the Organization of African Unity (now African Union) to admit SADR to its membership on 22nd August 1982, and the AU Charter which calls for the unquestionable and inalienable right of a people to self-determination.\n\n“Further, the country aligns itself with decisions of subsequent AU Assemblies of Heads of State and Government on SADR,” Kamau said in the note dated September 16.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso read: US stresses support for Morocco over W. Sahara\n\nLast week, a day after President Ruto took office, he tweeted: “Kenya rescinds its recognition of the SADR and initiates steps to wind down the entity’s presence in the country.” This was posted after he had earlier met Sahrawi President Brahim Ghali, who attended his inauguration, and later Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita.\n\nThe tweet was later deleted.\n\nHowever, the President also did say that Kenya supports the United Nations framework “as the exclusive mechanism to find a lasting solution of the dispute over Western Sahara.”\n\nAlso read: UN names new envoy for Western Sahara\n\nThe Foreign Ministry in Kenya told embassies all formal declarations will, in future, be made only through formal diplomatic documents, not social media, in an apparent move to prevent another gaffe.\n\nThe President indicated that relations with Morocco will, nonetheless, be speeded up “in areas of trade, agriculture, health, tourism, energy, among others, for the mutual benefit of our countries.”\n\nThe announcement would have upended a decades-old policy in which African countries generally support the call for a referendum for a region claimed by Morocco as part of its territory.\n\n******\n\nThe SADR has had a seat at the African Union since 1982 and had, for a long time, caused Morocco’s withdrawal from the AU, then known as the Organization of African Unity (OAU) until 2017 when Rabat returned to the bloc.\n\nThe decision means Kenya has joined the US in recognising Morocco against SADR but it is the only African country to do so publicly.\n\nDuring Uhuru Kenyatta’s presidency, Kenya’s policy was to side with SADR. When Kenya’s then Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed ran for the Chairperson of the African Union Commission in 2017, she visited the SADR government in Algeria. That decision is said to have disadvantaged her as Morocco mounted a lobbying against her quest for AU chair.\n\nWestern Sahara has been claimed by Morocco since 1975. And Kenya had argued that the boundaries of Western Sahara as vacated by the Spanish colonialists should be left unchanged.\n\nInitially occupied by the Spanish, the Western Sahara was claimed by both Mauritania and Morocco. Mauritania later dropped its claim, leaving Rabat to call the region as its Southern Provinces.\n\nIn 1979, the UN General Assembly passed Resolution A / RES / 34/37 which provided “the unequal rights of Western Sahara people in their own discretion and liberty, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, the Charter of the Organization of the African Unity and the purposes of the General Assembly.”\n\nThe dispute between the two sides had been floated in the UN systems, including at the International Court of Justice. But a referendum meant to determine the future of the region is yet to be organised as both sides disagree on who should participate.",

Backstory: In July, Kenya’s Asset Recovery Agency (ARA) got a court order to freeze 56 bank accounts which seven companies had used to launder Ksh 7 billion (~ $59.2 million). Of the seven companies, Flutterwave had about Ksh 6.7 billion frozen in 52 accounts from several banks including Guarantee Trust Bank, EcoBank, and Equity Bank. Later in August, the ARA received another order to freeze more accounts belonging to the fintech. The court froze funds worth Ksh 400.6 million ($3.3 million) across three banks including UBA, Access Bank, and Safaricom M-Pesa. And now? Well, about 2,468 investors say their money is part of the money frozen by the ARA in its pursuit of Flutterwave. Spokesperson Morris Ebitimi Joseph explained to Business Daily that they invested in a company called 86 Football Technology—also known as 86FB, 86Z, or 86W. The investors made deposits for an investment scheme that promised better returns which did not come to fruition. Investigations by the investors led them to believe that they had been swindled to the tune of Ksh 1.44 billion ($11 million) by a dubious person via transactions on Flutterwave. Now, they want Kenyan courts to separate Ksh 1.44 billion out of the frozen Ksh 6.7 billion released to them. “I believe that the issuance of an order compelling Guarantee Trust Bank, Equity Bank and Ecobank to deposit the sums excluded in the bank accounts of our advocates, justice shall be served to the 2,468 interested parties who were swindled of their hard-earned money through the scheme,” Ebitimi said. Zoom out: While the Central Bank of Kenya has accused Flutterwave of operating without a license, the fintech has maintained that it submitted an application for licensing back in 2019, citing the country’s notoriously long licensing process. Meanwhile, the ARA’s freeze order is valid only for 90 days as it gears up for its case against Flutterwave which is set to appear in court in November.\n\n\n\nSEND BY FLUTTERWAVE Don’t just send money, send money fast.

Last week, the DStv parent company announced its acquisition of Namola, an on-demand emergency response app. So, more choices for MultiChoice? Yup. MultiChoice South Africa CEO, Nyiko Shiburi, said “Namola is part of our strategy to expand our ecosystem beyond entertainment and to offer a suite of consumer services that meet the needs of our customers.” Namola describes itself as South Africa’s leading response solution “that allows all citizens get help fast”. On the app, users can get access to the public emergency services in South Africa including the police, fire service, ambulance and other community services. Its premium plan, Namola Plus, even allows users opt-in to receive help in emergency situations where they can’t reach or answer their phones. Namola’s individual plan costs R29 (2$) per month, the couples plan is R59 ($3.30), and the family package is R99 ($5.6) monthly. With MultiChoice’s acquisition, Namola will now be available to all DStv users—at extra cost, of course. From October 26, South African users can add the service to their bill. Big picture: MultiChoice has big plans for its future. Other than its recent acquisition of Namola, it also recently launched an internet service called DStv Internet, and it’s planning to launch its own smart TV called DStv Glass. MultiChoice Group CEO, Calvo Mawela, also announced last week that the company is looking to foray into fintech, although we might not be seeing that for a while.\n\n\n\nBAMBOO EXPANDS INTO GHANA Bamboo, one of Nigeria’s leading online brokerage firms, has expanded into Ghana, making it the first trans-national West African brokerage app. Through a partnership with 10th Capital Investments, a licensed Ghanaian firm, the more-than-50,000 users on Bamboo Ghana’s waitlist will now be able to buy and invest in stocks from US companies like Apple Inc and Tesla. When Bamboo raised a $15 million Series A round in January, its CEO announced that Ghana’s market was the company’s next frontier. Nine months and another $17.4 million raise later, the Ghana plans have become a reality. In a statement shared with TechCabal, Bamboo said it recently received a No Objection Letter from Ghana’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate in the country, enabling it to launch successfully. “We believe strongly that all Africans should earn a return on their investments and build intergenerational wealth. That’s why we created Bamboo: we wanted to create an easy and secure way for everyday Africans to invest in the US stock market, and eventually, in all types of asset classes,” said Richmond Bassey, Bamboo CEO and co-founder. Since its 2019 launch, Bamboo and other retail investment apps providing access to foreign securities like Chaka, Trove and Rise have had to deal with harsh regulatory conditions in their home country, Nigeria. In April last year, Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) labelled this category of companies as illegal and warned operators in the capital market to desist from operating with them. This was followed by Nigeria’s central bank describing Bamboo as unlicensed and freezing its bank accounts for a while. Despite the struggles, Bamboo has maintained its resolve to work “very closely with regulators in Nigeria” to ensure mutual satisfaction from both parties. Now in Ghana, Bamboo has committed to working with the country’s SEC on an ongoing basis to develop a standard regulatory framework for the retail investment industry Bamboo is pioneering. Through Bamboo’s US digital investing partner, DriveWealth LLC, the Nigeria-born company assures users that all accounts can claim insurance of up to $500,000 via the US Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). With regulations and insurance in place, Bamboo is ready to make retail investment a norm in Ghana. Albert Asiamah, 10th Capital Investments COO, was effusive about the performance of Bamboo’s product in Nigeria, describing the investment as ideal and beneficial. “We’re thrilled to work with [the Bamboo team] to bring Ghanaians the opportunity to invest in the US and eventually the local stock market. Their impeccable track record in Nigeria, stellar product and educational tools make them an ideal collaborator,” he said. “Together with Bamboo, we’ve been able to provide investors across Africa with affordable access to the US markets. Today, we’re thrilled to extend that same access to the people of Ghana,” said John Shammas, head of technical sales at DriveWealth. “As we continue our international expansion, we look forward to empowering more customers with the tools they need to improve their financial well-being and engage with the markets,” he added.\n\n\n\nSELL MORE WITH PAYSTACK Increase your online sales with a Paystack Storefront – a free, beautiful seller page that helps you bring creative ideas to life. 👉🏾 Learn more at paystack.com/storefront.

In Africa, its importance is extra critical as activities ranging from financial services to social commerce depend on its availability. Yet, internet speeds across many African countries are far below the global average. At 68.9 megabits per second (mbps), South Africa leads the continent in terms of internet speed, though it fell short of the 77.7mbps global average according to Ookla’s Speedtest Global Index. The effects are dire as it restricts young Africans from harnessing more opportunities in the global digital economy where reliable and fast internet remain key. While 3G and 4G internet services are largely available across the continent, they pale in comparison to the speed 5G internet brings. Currently, about 13 nations are testing 5G networks, with over 40 nations yet to lay down a foundation for the creation of 5G spectrums. The impact of the 5G internet is already obvious on the continent. According to Sylwia Kechiche, principal industry analyst, enterprise at Ookla, MTNSouth Africa performed better than its competitors on the continent as a result of the 5G technology. “We can clearly see the impact that 5G has on overall performance as South African operators came first thanks to having 5G networks in place. MTN South Africa was well ahead of the rest of operators, despite facing challenges with load shedding, with a median download speed of 65.95 mbps If we take 5G out of the equation, Safaricom Kenya was the fastest operator among the analyzed operators,” he said. While analysts predict that 5G will add $2.2 trillion to Africa’s economy by 2034, the transition doesn’t seem so smooth. Existing challenges include spectrum regulation clarity, commercial viability, deployment deadlines, and low citizen purchasing power of 5G enabled smartphones and expensive internet. To accelerate adoption of 5G technologies in Africa, African countries must develop clear and comprehensive frameworks for infrastructure deployment, use, regulation, and management. Spectrum pooling should be implemented to optimise the benefits of available spectrum and increase available bandwidths for mobile operators. Furthermore, spectrum trading should be pursued to enable cost-effective and efficient spectrum use to optimise the transfer of spectrum rights to users who require the 5G network spectrum the most, thereby lowering auction spectrum prices.

As a bamboo ambassador in Kenya, she works in land restoration by replanting bamboo, especially by her country's rivers.\n\nShe notes that most people do not understand the technical knowledge that many environmentalists use, and for this reason the bamboo they plant is used in nature trails which, mainly tourists, undertake. Tourism is relevant in this case also because hotels and lodges are built along the rivers and wetlands in Kenya, and these are the stakeholders that they have chosen to use as their partners in their restoration projects.\n\nIn their search for a sustainable solution for houseing, along with Kenya's Ministry of Housing, Wendy's organisation is bringing a new technology through bamboo, which can be used to produce sustainable housing in Kenya.\n\nThere is a lot of land in Africa, but it is hard to raise capita.

    "‘Restoring the river’: why Kenyans are returning to precolonial spirituality": "Wairimu Mukuru started sharing TikTok videos about Kikuyu culture earlier this year. Within months, the 26-year-old had gained more than 60,000 followers and received at least 1m views of her videos, where she talks about her ethnic group’s traditional practices and beliefs on topics such as mental health and sex.\n\nMukuru, a Kikuyu language teacher, is one of a small but growing number of Kenyans from the country’s largest ethnic group, the Agīkūyū, who are trying to revive precolonial cultural and spiritual practices. The belief systems were suppressed and marginalised during British colonial rule in the 19th century, and as Christianity became more entrenched.\n\nWairimu Mukuru started sharing TikTok videos about Kikuyu culture this year. Photograph: TikTok\n\n“Westernisation was entangled with Christianity,” says King’ori wa Kanyi, a member of the Agīkūyū Council of Elders. “A good African convert had to take a European name, dress like a European and visit the clinic instead of the herbalist.”\n\nAbout 85% of Kenyans identify as Christians and the religion has become an entrenched part of the country’s political and cultural fabric, marking naming, birth, marriage and political ceremonies.\n\n“There’s a new kind of Pentecostalism that has consumed much of how we understand ourselves,” says Kamau Wairuri, a socio-political researcher at the Edinburgh University. “Since people are not familiar with other alternatives, those looking to practise a different kind of spirituality might not know where to begin.”\n\nAdherents of Kikuyu spirituality say it is inseparable from their culture and is treated as a way of life. During colonial rule, the community fought to retain their spiritual systems but the practices were labelled as “savage” pagan religions and ultimately pushed to the margins.\n\n“Colonialism destroyed indigenous African religions, labelling them primitive and not good for the modern age,” said Jacob Olupona, a professor of African religious traditions at Harvard divinity school. “With time, Africans stopped seeing something good in their own traditions. Those belief systems became so marginalised that some have become like secret societies.”\n\nToday, less than 2% of Kenyans practise traditional beliefs. But experts say accurate estimates are elusive because many practise indigenous belief systems alongside mainstream religions such as Christianity and Islam.\n\nAlthough the numbers are fairly low across Africa, and many of those who do practise traditional religions are seen as outliers, some Kikuyu elders say that there has been a slow but gradual shift in attitudes within the community.\n\n“Many people are now rejecting European imposed religious and cultural identities,” says Kanyi, adding that among the Agīkūyū, there is a term for the efforts to revive indigenous beliefs, which translates as “restoring the river to its original course”.\n\nKikuyu girls in 1936-37 at a Church of Scotland mission school in Kenya, where they were dressed in European clothes and taught domestic skills. Photograph: Universal Images/Alamy\n\nExperts say interest has grown as a rising number of the African diaspora returned to the continent over the past decade, in search of their ancestral traditions. “It has emboldened those who are practising it at home,” says Olupona.\n\nObservers say renewed reckonings over the legacies of colonialism may also prompt greater interest in precolonial cultural and spiritual practices. Nevertheless, those looking to reclaim their heritage face challenges. Most African spiritual belief systems are an oral tradition and are not recorded in writing.\n\n“There’s a lot that has been washed away,” says Mukuru, who has been exploring the Kikuyu cultural and spiritual history for several years.\n\nIf we lose these religions ... we would have lost an entire civilisation Jacob Olupona\n\nSome accounts on the Agīkūyū way of life were written by the Kikuyu historian Godfrey Muriuki and Louis Leakey, a Kenyan-British archaeologist who lived among the community for most of his life. Mukuru says a lot of the history can also be found in the community’s language, sayings, songs and stories by Kikuyu writers such as Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o.\n\nTraditional religions are also fiercely guarded by community elders and practitioners, say experts, adding that their oral form has allowed religions to evolve and incorporate beliefs from other religions.\n\nBut the efforts to revive traditional beliefs have not been welcomed in all quarters. Some members of the community, especially those over 50, strongly oppose the revival, says Mukuru’s teacher and spiritual guide, Kariithi wa Njenga. Many have embraced Christianity.\n\nKikuyu men and women dancing in traditional dress in Kenya’s former Central province, the Kikuyu heartland. Photograph: Images of Africa Photobank/Alamy\n\nThose who try to re-engage with the traditions, like Mukuru, also face some pressure to adopt it wholesale. She does not agree with some old Kikuyu traditions, such as female genital mutilation, for example. But she says the traditions entail a wide range of beliefs, including many that are progressive.\n\nUnder Kikuyu cultural practice, women had control over agricultural production, the community’s main source of livelihood. Mukuru says she was surprised to discover that the culture was also matrilineal and sexually liberal. “Sensual dances were used as a way to gauge sexual synergy with the opposite sex,” she says.\n\nEnvironmental protection was also an important part of the culture. “Treating animals and plants with respect is a mark of spiritual maturity among the Agīkūyū,” says Kanyi, adding that the community attached spiritual significance to mountains and trees, and observed a mainly plant-based diet.\n\nSuch spiritual practices are only held sacred by the community’s few practitioners. Experts say they have become custodians of an important history and culture. “If we lose these religions, it would be a big loss for the world,” says Olupona. “We would have lost an entire civilisation.”\n\nSign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:\n\nSign up for Global Dispatch – please check your spam folder for the confirmation email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "When Kenya's Treasury had Sh24m cash 111 years ago": "DP Rigathi Gachagua in Kisumu for the National Music Festivals. [DPPS]\n\nWhen the new regime of President William Ruto took office this month, Kenyans’ jaws dropped when they heard that the country’s coffers were empty.\n\nIn the words of Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua, by the time they were sworn in on September 13, the coffers at Central Bank had just Sh93 million.\n\nAlthough experts have tried to explain that this does not necessarily mean the heavily indebted country is broke, the current circumstances bring back memories of where Kenya was at a time like this in September 1911, exactly 111 years ago.\n\nThe state of the economy then was not rosy and although it was not incumbent on politicians then to expose the nakedness of their motherland, the official statement issued then was quite enlightening.\n\nAccording to a statement by the man in charge of Treasury, H A Smallwood, as at September 30, 1911, the East African Protectorate had £322,922 in various accounts. This by the current exchange rate of Sh136 to translates to about Sh43.9 million.\n\nThere was only £177,349 (about Sh24 million) in cash while the government had £1,036 in suspense account amounts which was at the time classified as a liability.\n\nOther liabilities of the protectorate then were listed as £45,362 while nickels and aluminum coinage accounted for £1,870\n\nAlthough the East African Protectorate morphed into the Kenya colony in 1920, and later became a republic in 1963, the country’s economy is not what it was a century ago.\n\nFrom a country whose capital city, Nairobi started off as a tin shack, the economy, going by the Kenya Economic survey 2022 is now valued at Sh12 trillion.\n\nDespite the expansion, the country in some areas is still grappling with adverse effects of drought as happened shortly before the coming of the colonialists.\n\nThe question of where the next meal will come from still dominates homesteads today, just as it did a century ago.\n\nWhile Kenyans in urban areas are crying out to the government to lower the price of unga, in the remote areas millions are thirsting for a few drops of water to quench their thirst and any kind of pasture for their emaciated animals being wiped out by drought at an alarming rate.\n\nThe Lunatic Express (Uganda Railway) has since given birth to Standard Gauge Railway but most of the lines where the old trains used to ferry passengers and goods have since ceased operations.\n\nYet, although so much has changed in 111 years, some regions have been caught in a time warp and Kenya now just like then is in desperate need of injection of capital.",
    "Will U.S.-China Competition Shape Kenya’s Trade Trajectory?": "Kenya’s much anticipated presidential election recently concluded with the Supreme Court confirming President William Ruto’s victory. In the runup to this close contest, Kenya’s political discourse was for once focused on economic and policy concerns. As the new government takes up the reins of administration, trade will feature in the policy solutions to ongoing challenges like rising unemployment rates, Kenya’s large public sector debt, concerns around equitable taxation, and the residual effects of global shocks such as the coronavirus pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war. In charting the direction of the country’s post-election economic policy, trade will be important in various ways: its volume, bridging Kenya’s trade deficit, and the country’s external relations.\n\nA cursory look at Kenya’s international trade reveals some striking patterns (see figure 1). The country’s total merchandise trade volume in 2020 amounted to $21 billion or 21 percent of GDP. More than 16 percent of this total is from trade with China (the country’s top trading partner), followed by the EU ($2.9 billion), India ($1.8 billion), and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) ($1.2 billion). The United States (nearly $1.0 billion) is Kenya’s fifth-largest trade partner. Other major economic partners include Uganda and Tanzania, both in East Africa. These trade relationships with major external partners will shape the new Kenyan government’s policy objectives especially around increasing the productivity of agriculture, manufacturing, and small businesses.\n\nKenya’s international trade is also an area where great power competition could play out. The country’s main exports to the United States, in 2019, were fairly diversified and included woven apparel ($286 million); knit apparel ($168 million); edible fruit and nuts ($55 million); ores, slag, and ash ($52 million); and coffee, tea, and spice ($41 million). This trade was enabled in large part by the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, the preferential market access agreement for countries south of the Sahara. Meanwhile, Kenya imported aircraft ($59 million), plastics ($58 million), machinery ($41 million), and cereals ($30 million) from the United States.\n\nZainab Usman Zainab Usman is a senior fellow and director of the Africa Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, D.C. Her fields of expertise include institutions, economic policy, energy policy, and emerging economies in Africa. More >\n\nThere are ongoing discussions between the United States and Kenya for a free trade agreement as Kenya seeks to become a manufacturing hub for U.S. companies looking to diversify or relocate out of China. In the interim, the two countries signed the U.S.-Kenya Strategic Trade and Investment Partnership (STIP) in July 2022, an agreement that identified areas around which to “develop an ambitious roadmap for enhanced cooperation with the goal of negotiating high-standard commitments in order to achieve economically meaningful outcomes.” The initial areas of collaboration include agriculture; digital trade; micro, small, and medium enterprises; supporting the participation of women, youth, and others in trade; collaboration on standards setting; and trade facilitation and customs procedures.\n\nThe U.S.-Kenya STIP was launched against the backdrop of China’s rapidly rising trade relationship with Kenya. Since 2000, China-Kenya trade has grown nearly thirty-fold, from $106 million to $3.5 billion in 2020. As these trade volumes have grown, so has Kenya’s trade deficit. The country’s total trade deficit as of 2020 stands at around $9.7 billion, and China ($3.3 billion) accounts for about one-third of this imbalance (see figure 2). Between 2015 and 2019, for instance, Kenya’s main exports to China were “titanium and zirconium ores and concentrates” (around 60 percent), vegetable textile fibers (4.9 percent), and petroleum oils (4.7 percent), among others. Its major imports are “electrical machinery and equipment (19 percent); nuclear reactors, boilers, machinery, and mechanical appliances and parts (18 percent); iron and steel (7 percent); and plastics (6 percent).”\n\nClosing this trade deficit is a salient topic that features regularly in diplomatic engagement between the two countries. Indeed, it was one of the announcements at the 2021 Forum on China-Africa Cooperation. In January 2022, China and Kenya also signed six bilateral trade agreements that focused on removing tariffs and other trade and nontrade barriers. These agreements promised access to China’s large market for Kenyan exporters and included protocols to facilitate bilateral trade, especially exports of avocados and aquatic products. In August 2022, Kenya became the first African country to export fresh avocados to China.\n\nAline Abayo Aline Abayo is a James C. Gaither Junior Fellow in the Carnegie Africa Program.\n\nBeyond the United States and China, Kenya has strong and growing trade relations with other major countries. The UAE imports refined petroleum, tea, and meat from Kenya. In July 2022, the UAE and Kenya announced the start of trade negotiations to initiate a comprehensive economic partnership agreement that aims to reduce trade barriers between the two countries. With this agreement, the UAE will invest in Kenya's vital economic sectors, such as tourism and agriculture, and boost non-oil trade and investment. Kenya also signed an economic partnership agreement with the UK in December 2020; the agreement provided quota-free and duty-free market access for all Kenyan products, including manufactured and processed ones. The agreement also guaranteed tariff-free access to Kenya’s market for UK suppliers of machinery, electronics, and technical equipment, among others.\n\nWithin Africa, Kenya is a critical actor driving some aspects of regional integration. With its 2021 GDP of $110.3 billion, it is the largest economy and major driver of rapid integration in the East African Community (EAC). It is no surprise, therefore, that Kenya ranked second on regional integration in Africa. The EAC ranks highest on the Africa Regional Integration Index, with the free movement of people as its most robust dimension. An Afrobarometer survey on East African integration shows that 52 percent of Kenyans approve of the free movement of goods, services, and labor. However, there is still a gap in public awareness and support for this integration.\n\nKenya’s notable progress in securing regional and international trade deals is positioning the country as an important trading economy. It will be crucial for Kenya to balance its overlapping and complicated relationships with the great powers, its trade ties with neighbors in the EAC, and its interest in advancing the African Continental Free Trade Area. As Kenya’s new president takes office, trade policy will be at the heart of the country’s plans to close its trade deficit, generate jobs, increase public revenues, and boost productivity.",

    "Kenya: Anticipatory actions towards General Elections - Operation Update Report - DREF n° MDRKE051, Operation update n° 1 - Kenya": "Summary of major revisions made to emergency plan of action:\n\nThis operation update informs stakeholders on actions undertaken since starting the anticipatory actions on 1st May 2022 through the General Elections held on 9th August 2022, the proclamation of results which took place on 15th August 2022, and subsequent Supreme Court final decision on elections results made on 5th September.\n\nIndeed, after the election results were announced on 15th August, there were cases of localized disturbances in several parts of the country including Mombasa, Kisumu, Wajir, Migori, Garissa, Busia, Kisii, Homa Bay, Siaya, West Pokot, Kakamega, Uasin Gishu, Kericho, Kiambu, and Bungoma. At the same time, 8 elective areas including the gubernatorial elections for Kakamega and Mombasa counties were postponed by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) to 29th August (22 August Nation Media Reports). Furthermore, the presidential results announced on 15th August 2022 were challenged and several petitions were filed at the Supreme Court (Nation) with a decision made by the court on 5th September.\n\nThe localized disturbances resulted in emergency needs which prompted the Kenyan Red Cross Society (KRCS) to respond with First Aid services, mental health, and psychosocial support and increased monitoring of the various political activities reaching 769 people in 12 counties. This Operation Update informs on response actions following the triggering of the majority of indicators in scenario 2 of the EPoA, leading to an increase in KRCS preparedness and response and therefore incurring additional costs. Key revisions in this operation include below:\n\n• KRCS maintaining its volunteers, staff, and logistics on the ground beyond the planned 2 days in EPoA to ensure comprehensive monitoring and coverage of the various events until 30th September.\n\n• Cater costs resulting from extending and adapting the surveillance and assistance to 6 hotspot counties (Garissa, Wajir, Homabay, West Pokot, Kakamega, and Kitui), in addition to 6 initial target counties (Kisumu, Nairobi, Mombasa, Nakuru, Uasin Gishu and Kiambu).\n\n• KRCS has extended preparedness activities including PFA refresher training sessions ambulance prepositioning, maintaining teams on standby, and conducting transect drives in high-risk areas in Kakamega, Kitui, West Pokot, Mombasa, Nakuru, and Meru while awaiting the completion of vote extended and waiting also the Supreme Court ruling on the 5th September and surveillance for additional days after it was completed. In this regard, the below adjustments have been conducted:\n\nRed Cross Action Teams (RCAT): Deployment of first aid volunteers for additional 6 days in 6 targeted counties and 6 additional counties. To cover the pending elections in Kakamega and Mombasa, the time until the court decision. Same 270 volunteers and 30 supervisors deployed for 6 extended days and adapted to the operational imperative: 30 volunteers and 3 supervisors deployed per high-risk counties and 15 volunteers for the other hotspots.\n\nAmbulances and vehicles prepositioned and deployed (2 days prior and 4 days after) as the need arises in the two areas (Kakamega and Mombasa counties) where gubernatorial elections will be held. In total, over the 12 hotspots, 6 ambulances, and 13 vehicles were deployed plus 1 in Nairobi.\n\nConduct monitoring and passive surveillance until the end of the operation in high-risk areas in Kakamega, Kitui, West Pokot (hotspot identified during the response), Mombasa, Nakuru, and Meru (initially targeted areas). This includes maintaining teams on standby to continue undertaking regular transect drives at hotspot areas for direct observations covering investiture and post-investiture until the end of September to respond to any emergency needs.\n\n• Ensure proper closing of the operation by 30th September 2022 with an operational learning session.\n\nA budget increase of CHF 75,428 from the initial allocation of CHF 189,070 is also requested to cover the additional costs incurred from activities listed above within the same timeframe initially allocated (4 months).\n\nA. SITUATION ANALYSIS\n\nDescription of the disaster\n\nKenya held its General Elections on 9 August 2022 as planned. With 14,164,561 registered voters, a low voter turnout was reported with 64.6% Kenyans voting, a dip from the 80% turnout in 2017. Vote counting and verification by the Independent Elections and Commission (IEBC) Board was a protracted process resulting in speculations, misinformation, and disinformation spreading through social media and other platforms. This fuelled public anxiety as the country awaited the announcement of the results of the president with a close call between the two main contending candidates of the opposing coalitional parties. The IEBC announced one of the coalition leaders as the president-elect on 15 August 2022, while four IEBC commissioners disputed the presidential election outcomes citing the opaqueness of the process. On 17 August 2022, one of the other presidential candidates issued an announcement rejecting the declared presidential results by the IEBC.\n\nThe voting day, while generally peaceful in most parts of the country, was also marred by events in some counties such as injuries due to fighting at polling stations, malfunction of the Kenya Integrated Elections Management system (KIEMS) Kits, as reported by nation media and IEBC briefings, resorting to using of manual registers and insecurity concerns in areas such as Eldas, Wajir county where voting was postponed to 10th August (Citizen digital Reports). In addition, violence outbreaks were reported in various counties including Wajir, Kisii, Kisumu, Uasin Gishu, Baringo, Bungoma, Nakuru, Nairobi, Kiambu, Garissa, Kericho, Migori, Homa bay, Machakos, Siaya, West Pokot, Kakamega, Kitui, Bomet, Nyamira, Kajiado, and Busia (Star Newspaper, Nation Media), leading to 16 fatalities and 143 persons injured and receiving first aid services as recorded by the KRCS daily situation reports since the election day. Nation Media), leading to 16 fatalities and 143 persons injured and receiving first aid services as recorded by the KRCS daily situation reports since the election day.\n\nKRCS has been updating its elections situation analysis based on its Contingency Plan and the unfolding situation. Based on the triggering of several indicators, the unfolding scenario in the country is aligned with scenario 2 of the EPoA with localized post-electoral contestations, a contested process, contested IEBC services, isolated incidents of violence, long-awaited declaration of the results and postponement of elections in 8 localities with some found in the targeted hotspot counties identified.\n\nSome of the critical events to note include the voting day, 9th August, which was generally calm across the country, 10th August when different provisional results circulated across media platforms, and which were later directed to stop reporting by the IEBC. Localized violence and disturbances were reported particularly between the 11th and 15th of August in some areas including the hotspot counties of Nakuru, Kisumu, Garissa, Narok, Bomet, Mombasa, and Wajir counties. The declaration of the presidential results on 15th August resulted in a contested IEBC service, process, and rejection of the election results by the losing coalition and 4 of the IEBC commissioners. As a result, a petition challenging the presidential results was filed at the Supreme Court with a verdict rendered on 5th September 2022. Reactions to this decision and the swearing-in ceremony will be observed until 30th September.",
    "Wash-wash: Jitters as Kenya set to know its fate on money laundering controls": "Kenya's broken systems breed wash-wash cons. [Wilberforce Okwiri, Standard]\n\nKenya faces an acid test in the next two months on the status of reforms to strengthen anti-money laundering controls with the global dirty money watchdog expected to release its scorecard for the country.\n\nThe looming report backed by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) will either place or exclude Kenya in an infamous grey list for its efforts or lack of in fighting money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nInclusion in a ‘grey’ watchlist by the Paris-based agency, could risk reputational damage to Kenya which is East Africa’s largest economy and business hub which may hurt foreign investment.\n\nThe agency’s regular reports and assessments usually group countries from the United States to China based on their responses to tackle financial crime.\n\nThe assessments usually highlight a series of failings or successes, including lack of or adequate control of those who handle large sums of money.\n\nThe report is supported by the Eastern and Southern Africa Anti-Money Laundering Group (ESAAMLG) of which Kenya is a member of and whose role is to combat money laundering by implementing the FATF Recommendations.\n\n“Kenya has been undergoing a mutual evaluation led by FATF regional partner ESAAMLG, which is in the final stages and assesses the strengths and weaknesses of Kenya’s anti-money laundering (AML) and counter financing of terrorist (CFT) system,” said the FATF in response to queries by Financial Standard.\n\nBroadly, the result of being added to the grey list is that it will increase the cost of doing business for local companies with foreign trading partners.\n\nFor instance, a Kenyan multinational now doing business in European or American markets would have to provide detailed information on its activities to banks there and its procedures to mitigate possible money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nThe specific implications of this are that global correspondent banks and other intermediary financial institutions involved in transactions with Kenyan entities are likely to demand a higher level of due diligence.\n\nAnalysts said this year’s assessment is crucial at a time Kenya is clamouring to ease decade-old rules for transacting in large cash risking the wrath of the global dirty money watchdog.\n\nPresident William Ruto has said that he wants the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) to relax the rules for reporting transactions beyond Sh1 million.\n\nThe rules fall under the Proceeds Of Crime And Anti-Money Laundering Act (the POCAMLA) which is the key enactment which supports the AML legal framework in Kenya.\n\nThe CBK has been hesitant to implement a similar order given by retired President Uhuru Kenyatta citing money laundering concerns and breach of international obligations.\n\nCBK governor Patrick Njoroge recently reiterated that any fresh review would not lose sight of Kenya’s international obligations adding that Kenya is committed to meeting international standards on anti-money laundering.\n\nDr Njoroge maintained that banks should refer to a history of regular cash transactions in flagging suspicious deals so that they do not subject customers to questions on the source and use of the cash every time they visit banking halls. CBK Governor Patrick Njoroge. [File, Standard]\n\nThis came as the FATF which is said to be watching Kenya on its latest plans refused to be drawn into the possible implications of easing rules on large cash transactions.\n\n“The FATF cannot comment on planned legislation or legislative changes outside of the framework of a mutual evaluation or follow-up process,” said the global agency in response to questions by The Standard.\n\nA previous report welcomed Kenya’s efforts but warned that lawyers and certified public secretaries were not captured as\n\nreporting persons under the POCAMLA obligations.\n\nPresident Ruto recently asked the CBK to implement the order without further delay citing ongoing hindrances to small businesses.\n\n“In our engagements, traders also complained about the onerous burden involved in cash transactions exceeding Sh1million,” he said recently, adding that many traders have reverted to storing money under their mattresses at great risk, which is clearly not the intention of the anti-money laundering regulations.\n\nChapter 231 of the Constitution says the CBK “shall not be under the direction or control of any person or authority in the exercise of its powers or the performance of its functions.”\n\n“While we remain fully committed to mitigating this risk, we believe that there is scope to make compliance less burdensome on genuine business transactions,” he said.\n\n“I have been assured by the Central Bank that work on how to ease this burden without compromising the security of the financial system is underway.”\n\nRetired President Kenyatta last October issued a directive to raise the limit of suspicious cash transactions commercial lenders are required to report under anti-money laundering laws to facilitate cash deals among traders.\n\nUhuru had ordered the immediate raise of the reporting limit for both deposits and withdrawals above the current Sh1 million, without saying what the new figure will be.\n\nLenders earlier said they were waiting for the CBK’s nod to raise the threshold for reporting transactions beyond the Sh1 million.\n\nThe law mandates financial institutions to keep records of cash transactions of more than Sh1 million and report suspicious deals to the FRC. Central Bank of Kenya (CBK). [File, Standard]\n\nInsiders say banks would benefit from the increase in the threshold for reporting but the regulator is hesitant as it would breach some international obligations.\n\nThe CBK issued a circular in 2016 reminding banks not to relent on prudential disclosures. Business people have complained that the cash limit has hindered their ability to carry out smooth transactions.\n\nThe law requires financial institutions to keep records of cash transactions of more than Sh1 million and report suspicious deals to the Financial Reporting Centre (FRC) – the agency operationalised in April 2012 and tasked with identifying and combating money laundering and financing of terrorism.\n\nBusinesses and individuals transacting more than Sh1 million are required to declare to their bankers why the money cannot be deposited or withdrawn through electronic means under the Kenya Electronic Payments and Settlement System and Real-Time Gross Payment System (KEPSS/RTGS).\n\nThe disclosures include the source of the cash, how it will be spent, who are direct and indirect beneficiaries as well as the full identity of the intended beneficiaries.\n\nThe global dirty money watchdog evaluates countries on 40 recommendations that should be in place to combat illicit financial flows.\n\nKenya recently launched its international financial centre in the capital after years of preparation to attract large foreign firms and boost capital flows.\n\nThe Kenyan hub is expected to model Nairobi as a financial district in line with existing financial centres in European, Middle East and the Far East capitals such as London, Dubai and Hong Kong.\n\nDespite Kenya’s relatively developed capital markets, 75 per cent of all business financing in the economy was from the banking sector, while the balance came from the capital markets, the Treasury said earlier, adding that the situation was not ideal.",

PHOTO | DENNIS ONSONGO | NMG\n\nBy OTIATO GUGUYU\n\nMore by this Author\n\nThe share of Kenya’s external debt from commercial lenders declined to 14 percent from 15.5 percent in the year to June 2022, reflecting difficulties the government has faced accessing international credit due to high interest rates.\n\nThe National Treasury cancelled issuance of a Eurobond and syndicated loan early this year due to the current high cost of borrowing, with investors at some point, demanding rates of up to 22 percent to lend to the country.\n\nThat saw commercial loans fall from Sh1.195 trillion to Sh1.181 trillion in the 12-month period, the latest filings by the Controller of Budget show.\n\nLack of access to commercial loans has seen Kenya lean on multilateral lenders such as the IMF and World Bank for support, which has increased their loan portions from Sh1.6 trillion to Sh1.9 trillion or 22.8 per cent of total debt.\n\nThe government has also turned its eyes inwards, pushing up domestic borrowing to Sh4.1 trillion and narrowing the gap with foreign loans from Sh302.4 billion in June last year to Sh2.3 billion at the end of June 2022.\n\n“As of 30th June 2022, the public debt stock stood at Sh8.45 trillion, comprising 50.7 percent due to external lenders and 49.3 percent due to domestic lenders,” said CoB Margaret Nyakango.\n\n“Total expenditure on public debt during fiscal year 2021/2022 amounted to Sh847.15 billion, compared to Sh765.91 billion recorded in 2020/2021. The increase is attributable to increased principal repayments and interest rates for domestic and external loans.”\n\nTreasury Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani said earlier that Eurobonds had become very expensive in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which forced Kenya to reconsider issuing a bond, which was expected to target $1 billion (Sh120 billion)\n\nKenya explored the option of raising a similar amount from a syndicate of banks but that also fell through due to high rates demanded by potential lenders.\n\nThe country has now turned to the IMF and the World Bank which have given Kenya multibillion shilling loans over the last two years, but which have also seen the multilateral lenders influence the country’s economic policy.\n\nIMF had imposed several conditions on Kenya to be able to access the loans in tranches including reforms of State enterprises, special audit on Covid-19 expenditure and wealth declaration of public servants.\n\nFinancing by the concessional lenders is, however, unlikely to be adequate to cover the Sh280 billion expected to come from external sources in the financing of the Sh845 billion budget deficit for the current fiscal year.\n\nThe new administration, therefore, finds itself at risk of crowding out the private sector should it be forced to dive even deeper into the domestic market for loans.\n\nIt also puts pressure on the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) to meet and possibly exceed the collection target for this year. The agency raised a record Sh2.031 trillion in the fiscal year ended June 2022, exceeding its revenue collection target by Sh148.9 billion.\n\n[email protected]",
    "Shock as Jordanian tourists in Kenya turn into beggars": "By Nation. Africa More by this Author\n\nSecurity agents in Mombasa county are holding 40 Jordanian nationals after they were found begging in Mombasa streets in what is suspected to be a foiled human trafficking case.\n\nMombasa residents were on Thursday shocked to see at least the 40 tourists begging along the streets of Old town to raise money for food and transport to allegedly travel to Nairobi.\n\nIn a rare occurrence, the tourists-turned beggars from the Jordanian nationals were spotted at the Marikiti market seeking help as they had run out of money to buy food and relocate to Nairobi.\n\n“They were asking for our help to raise money. We were surprised because we have never seen this before,” said Mohamed Hamisi, an Old Town resident.\n\nAccording to Mr Hamisi, it was a strange experience for the locals to encounter a situation where tourists who the Coast city depends on to raise revenue to turn into beggars, with nowhere to go.\n\nMvita Sub-county Police Commander Mr Maxwell Agoro who confirmed the arrest of the tourists said the foreigners had valid tourist visas but their only undoing was to convert into beggars, which contravenes the terms of their travel documents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe foreigners were arrested after the locals tipped off the police.\n\nMr Agoro said the information they received from the locals was that the foreigners were begging in areas including Mwembe Tayari, Kibokoni and Moi Avenue.\n\nThe foreigners included 19 adults and 21 children.\n\n“Upon finding them the police escorted them to the Central police station for interrogation. They were found to be going against the regulation of the visa by converting themselves to beggars as opposed to being tourists,” he said\n\nThe foreigners are currently being held up at the police station pending further probe.\n\n“Their passports have been forwarded to the immigration for further verification. Determination will be reached after verification of the documents.\n\nMr Agoro added that a preliminary analysis of the documents has revealed that they are valid.\n\n“Although the foreigners have contravened the conditions of the visa,” he added.\n\nSome of the 40 Jordanian nationals were arrested in the Marikiti area of Mombasa for begging despite being in the country with tourist Visas. PHOTO | NMG\n\nMr Agoro further said that the 40 were part of a group of foreigners who were on their way to (Eastleigh) Nairobi but opted to beg before leaving Mombasa.\n\nHe noted that the foreigners will be taken to the immigration office for processing of their documents before any further action is taken.\n\nThe foreigners are currently being interrogated at the Coast Regional Police Headquarters where the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) department has taken over the case.",
    "Kenya's national interests should guide its stand, says former PS": "Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic President Brahim Ghali arrives at Kasarani for President William Ruto's swearing-in. [Boniface Okendo, Standard]\n\nKenya has to choose what is in its best national interest, a former Foreign Affairs permanent secretary says.\n\nThe former PS said since 1981 when the African Union (AU) controversially elevated Polisario to the same level as ANC of South Africa, Algeria has ensured the Western Sahara issue remains on the AU agenda.\n\n“The sibling rivalry between Algeria and Morocco often veers into the ridiculous with a constant closure of borders between the two neighbours. With oil wealth, Algeria is a major contributor to the AU budget in Addis Ababa and therefore invariably sits on the top AU policy-making organs,” said the former PS who sought anonymity given that he is now retired and does not want to be involved formally.\n\nThe diplomatic conundrum is further worsened by the fact that the Arab League, a key regional organisation where the two countries are members, does not recognise Polisario or Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR).\n\nThe Arab League brings together Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordon, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Palestinian Authority, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen.\n\nThe PS said the United Nations policy and resolutions towards Western Sahara are also at variance with the AU position, with the global body supporting a UN-supervised referendum through resolutions already domiciled at the Security Council.\n\nHe said Morocco supported the UN mechanism that recently received a boost from an endorsement by Spain, the former colonial master, and the US while the European Union and the ASEAN do not recognise the SADR.\n\n“The league of Islamic countries does not recognise SADR or Polisario. Only the AU does. The AU position of which Algeria has been the principal advocate gets its inspiration from the AU principles on the right to self-determination and the recognition of colonial borders as inviolable as a foundation for sustainable peace across Africa,” he said.\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently issued a confusing statement that sought to clarify President William Ruto’s statement in reviewing Kenya’s policy on SADR following a meeting with Moroccan Foreign minister.",
    "Kenya eyes Korea fund for export promotion": "Market News Kenya eyes Korea fund for export promotion\n\nTrade CS Betty Maina. FILE PHOTO | NMG\n\nBy LYNET IGADWAH\n\nMore by this Author\n\nKenya is seeking Sh978 million from South Korea to fund its plan to grow exports by linking local producers to new markets and expanding the range of products and services the country sells to external buyers.\n\nThe Ministry of Industrialisation, Enterprise and Trade has made proposals to Korea Trade and investment agency (Kotra) to finance the integrated national export development and promotion strategy (INEDPS), which was launched in 2018 with a view to expand the country’s trade.\n\nThe plan involves identification and expansion of new markets for about 60 percent of manufactured products, in the country’s quest for wealth and job creation through exports.\n\n“Through its value chain approach, the INEDPS strategy links all target export products and services from their productive stage to their identified markets,” said the ministry’s assistant director of trade Musa Okwemba.\n\nThe sectors that have been prioritised for export development under the strategy include manufacturing, Information and Communication Technology (ICT).\n\nDestination markets for Kenya’s exports have remained narrow, with only 13 countries accounting for over 70 percent total exports.\n\nThe product base has equally been narrow, with five broad categories of products accounting for 56 percent of total exports.\n\n[email protected]",
    "Kenya: New battle brewing as Ruto and Raila claim majority in parliament": "President William Ruto’s Kenya Kwanza has named Kikuyu MP Kimani as its House leader. He is to be deputised by his Kilifi North counterpart Owen Baya.\n\nRaila’s Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya coalition has settled on Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi as its majority leader and Kathiani MP Robert Mbui as his deputy.\n\nSpeaking to members in his coalition, President Ruto has maintained that he commands the majority in the National Assembly and Senate. According to him, he has the numbers since his side won the Speaker position in both Houses.\n\n“I have heard them [Odinga’s coalition] try to say they have some numbers. If you cannot even raise a candidate for the Speaker of the Senate what numbers do you really have?” he said to Kenya Kwanza lawmakers during a coalition retreat.\n\nWith Kenya Kwanza MPs during the interrogation of our Manifesto at the ongoing Parliamentary Group meeting in Naivasha, Nakuru County. pic.twitter.com/mDauJgS7FC — William Samoei Ruto, PhD (@WilliamsRuto) September 17, 2022\n\nA week ago, Ruto’s candidate, Moses Wetangula, won the National Assembly Speaker’s race against Raila’s ally Kenneth Marende. In the Senate race, Azimio la Umoja did not participate citing fraud during the election process.\n\nOn the other hand, Martha Karua, who was Raila’s running mate in the August polls, maintains that her coalition is the majority party, and thus deserves to lead the House business.\n\n“We are the largest party in Parliament, we deserve to have the majority leader ,” she told the Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya Coalition parliamentary group meeting.\n\nREAD MORE Kenya: The Martha Karua euphoria that never was\n\nKalonzo Musyoka, another coalition leader, echoed Karua’s sentiments saying: “For the avoidance of doubt the AZIMIO-OKA coalition party is legally and legitimately the majority coalition in the National Assembly.”\n\nEarlier today, we convened Azimio Legislators' meeting with @RailaOdinga. We have the numbers, the energy, the courage and the drive to push for progress in our respective positions. #AzimioPG pic.twitter.com/SlTrhpCqcD — Martha Karua SC (@MarthaKarua) September 16, 2022\n\nBut who has the majority ?\n\nRaila’s coalition, according to the results of the 9 August polls, has a slim majority of 173 seats over Ruto’s coalition that has 164 MPs. There are 12 lawmakers who are independents, in a House that has a total of 349 elected representatives.\n\nHowever, after Ruto was declared winner of the presidential race, lawmakers from Azimio affiliated parties, which include, UDM, PAA, MCC and MDG, defected to Kenya Kwanza and signed a post election agreement.\n\nWith these defections, Ruto’s side now has 175 members, while Raila’s side has 162, even though the signed agreement is not legally binding. According to the Political Parties Act of 2011, a political party can only enter into a new coalition agreement after formally exiting an existing one.\n\nThe fight between the two coalitions is aimed at taking control of Parliamentary business as this is what shapes policies and critical decisions that affect Kenyan citizens in terms of economy, health, education, trade, among others.\n\nWho will solve this stalemate ?\n\nWith both sides standing their ground, Wetangula, who is from Ruto’s coalition, has a duty – as National Assembly Speaker – to determine which side has a majority.\n\nWetangula, who met both leaders, says although he is a member of the Kenya Kwanza coalition, he will arbitrate on the matter fairly.\n\n“I’m an impartial arbiter. I will provide direction on the matter,” he said.\n\nPolitical analyst Brian Wanyama says the Speaker’s decision will be a litmus test to show his skills on how best he can make determinations on delicate matters of national importance as the leader of the legislative army.\n\n“ The Speaker must be wise, Kenyans are watching to see how he will decide,” he tells The Africa Report."
