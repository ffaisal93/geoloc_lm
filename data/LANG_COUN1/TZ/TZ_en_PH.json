    "Powerful Typhoon Leaves 5 Rescuers Dead in North Philippines": "Typhoon Noru left a trail of destruction in northern Philippine provinces on Monday with at least eight people dead, including a group of rescuers who were scrambling to save villagers trapped in floodwaters, officials said.\n\nFive government rescuers drowned in San Miguel town in Bulacan province after their boat overturned when it was hit by a collapsed wall, tossing them into rampaging floodwaters, police and officials said.\n\n\"They were living heroes who were helping save the lives of our countrymen in the calamity,\" Bulacan Gov. Daniel Fernando told DZMM radio network. \"This is really very sad.\"\n\nOfficials and local rescue groups paid tribute to the rescuers on social media. \"They showed bravery and heroism in facing danger despite the perils to their own lives to fulfill their duty of saving other people,\" the Bulacan police force said on Facebook.\n\nThe most powerful typhoon to hit the country this year slammed ashore in eastern Quezon province on Sunday then weakened as it blew out into the South China Sea early Monday toward Vietnam, forecasters said.\n\nThousands evacuate, seek emergency shelter\n\nNearly 80,000 people were moved to emergency shelters, some forcibly, across the main Luzon island, disaster-response officials said.\n\nThree other deaths were reported by police, including a Bulacan villager who drowned after refusing orders to leave his house beside a swollen river. A missing farmer was found dead in a plantation that was hit by a flash flood and an elderly villager died after his house was hit by a landslide. Six fishermen were reported missing in Camarines Norte province, a disaster-response official told a news briefing.\n\nIn Aurora province's hard-hit Dingalan town, more than 6,000 houses were damaged and a newly built evacuation center housing more 200 displaced families was battered by the fierce wind and rain but no injuries were reported, officials said.\n\nAbout 3,000 people were evacuated to safety in metropolitan Manila, which was lashed by fierce wind and rain overnight. Classes and government work were suspended Monday in the capital and outlying provinces as a precaution although the morning skies were sunny.\n\nThe entire northern provinces of Aurora and Nueva Ecija, which were hit by the typhoon, remained without power Monday and repair crews were at work to bring back electricity, Energy Secretary Raphael Lotilla told President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in a televised meeting the president called to assess damage.\n\nMarcos Jr. praised officials for evacuating tens of thousands of people before the typhoon hit, preventing more deaths, but expressed concern at how Noru and another storm that devastated central and southern provinces in December rapidly intensified into super typhoons.\n\n\"Is this climate change?\" Marcos Jr., who took office in June, asked. \"We have kept watched on these storms for a long time but it wasn't like this before... This is something I have to deal with.\"\n\nMarcos Jr. later joined an aerial inspection of typhoon-hit provinces in the rice-growing region, where many villages and stretches of roads remained flooded.\n\nNoru underwent an \"explosive intensification\" over the open Pacific Ocean before it hit the Philippines, Vicente Malano, who heads the country's weather agency, told The Associated Press on Sunday.\n\nFrom sustained winds of 85 kilometers per hour (53 mph) on Saturday, Noru was a super typhoon just 24 hours later with sustained winds of 195 kilometers (121 miles per hour) and gusts of up to 240 kph (149 mph) at its peak late Sunday.\n\nBy Monday noon, Noru had sustained winds of 130 kph (81 mph) and gusts of 160 kph (99 mph) and was moving northwest in the South China Sea toward Vietnam, according to the weather agency.\n\nAbout 20 storms and typhoons batter the Philippines each year. The archipelago also lies in the \"Pacific Ring of Fire,\" a region along most of the Pacific Ocean rim where many volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur, making the Southeast Asian nation one of the world's most disaster-prone.",
    "Personal position and geopolitical posture in the Philippines": "Author: Editorial Board, ANU\n\nAt times during the presidency of Rodrigo Duterte, it seemed that the Philippines’ foreign policy was to not have much of a policy at all.\n\nAfter Duterte’s election in 2016, Manila’s approach towards its most important international relationships was pulled in different directions by personalities, politics, and the tensions between the interests at stake in its relationships with China and the United States. A big variable was the president himself, whose madcap governing style extended to how he handled the management of these two critical partnerships.\n\nThe Philippines wasn’t by any means unique in this regard. What appear to be Southeast Asian states’ finely calculated strategies of hedging and balancing amid great-power competition are, when scrutinised closely on the ground, often a process of trial and error in which policy fights are shaped by domestic economic, and even personal, interests and short political time horizons.\n\nThe Philippines was distinctive in how transparently all this played out, and how important the whims of a personalist leader were in setting the tone for alliance management.\n\nAfter the landslide election of Ferdinand ‘Bongbong’ Marcos Jr in this year’s presidential election, the Philippines is embarking on a reset of foreign policy under a less freewheeling — though no less politically dominant — president. This doesn’t mean that the Marcos approach to foreign affairs is predictable: he largely avoided talking seriously about policy during the election, appealing instead to nostalgia for the airbrushed version of his father’s dictatorship presented during his campaign. Onlookers were left to project their highest hopes and worst fears onto where he might end up.\n\nThese onlookers included policymakers in Washington, where Marcos’ election ‘has been met with cautious optimism…regarding the future of the US–Philippines alliance’, Luke Lischin writes in our lead article this week.\n\nMarcos has talked the talk about bringing the Philippines back into alignment with the United States, signing up to the Biden Administration’s Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) and paying rhetorical tribute to the US ‘special relationship’. Visiting New York for the United Nations General Assembly this week, he touted the Philippines’ potential as an investment destination for American capital and broke a seven-year drought of meetings with US presidents by sitting down with President Biden on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.\n\nBut as Lischin cautions ‘the pro-US rhetoric espoused by the Marcos administration is not a reliable indicator of the President’s commitment to the alliance’. The economic and strategic realities that pulled the Philippines closer to China are still there. And just like its predecessors, ‘the Marcos administration appears willing to sidestep issues of national sovereignty’ — specifically on the question of the South China Sea — ‘in order to strengthen the Philippines’ economic relations with China’\n\nHe concludes that ‘[a]s long as the Marcos administration continues to hedge, it is unlikely that the United States will be able to convince the Philippines to advance geopolitically sensitive projects that are critical to the alliance’.\n\nThe importance that economics has had in drawing China and the Philippines closer — in spite of the dispute over overlapping claims in the South China Sea — only highlights how relatively empty-handed Washington is when it comes to using trade and development to bind Southeast Asian partners closer to it. Washington might counter that the Philippines and similar Asian developing countries are courting trouble by boosting economic ties with China, whose government has proven that it has no compunction about making trade, aid and investment part of its sticks-and-carrots diplomacy.\n\nBut Southeast Asian governments understand that perfectly well, and most have decided that it’s a trade-off they are willing to make. As Manila seeks to re-engage with China on a multibillion-dollar infrastructure financing and construction package, it continues to deprioritise pursuing its legal claims to parts of the South China Sea. Marcos himself says he doesn’t want the dispute to be ‘the defining element of our relationship [with China]’.\n\nBy expanding economic ties with the Philippines and other Southeast Asian countries Washington could help make the trade-offs involved in deepening economic ties to China less acute by giving the region options for investment, aid and export markets. But that means more substantial forms of economic engagement than IPEF heralds, and will have to wait for the political winds to change in the United States.\n\nStill, it’s a more palatable option than waiting for the next most likely thing to get the Philippines to lean back into the US relationship: namely, a crisis provoked by Chinese envelope-pushing in the South China Sea, such as beginning land reclamation on Scarborough Shoal, the disputed but as-yet undeveloped islets lying within the Philippines’ Exclusive Economic Zone.\n\nUltimately, some of the key decisions impacting the Philippines’ relationship with its longstanding treaty ally won’t be made in Manila or Washington, but in Beijing as well.\n\nThe EAF Editorial Board is located in the Crawford School of Public Policy, College of Asia and the Pacific, The Australian National University.",

    "What is forgotten in the U.S.-Philippines friendship": "Listen 8 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nOn the eve of the 50th anniversary of his father’s brutal declaration of martial law, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., arrived in New York for the 77th session of the United Nations General Assembly. As he and President Biden discussed strategy in the South China Sea, a contempt of court order against the younger Marcos — ruling that his family must pay $2 billion to survivors of his father’s 14 years of unilateral rule under martial law — remains unenforced. And as he delivered an invited address to the New York branch of the Asia Society, activists and victims of the elder Marcos regime’s human rights abuses are fighting the historical revisionism that led to the family’s resurgence into national politics.\n\nA friendship and shared history between the two nations has often been the official framing of this binational relationship. On Aug. 5, ahead of the State Department’s official visit to the Philippines, it described the partnership as one between “friends, partners, and allies,” on the basis of “people-to-people” ties, exemplified by the large Filipino community in the United States. But such euphemisms have effectively covered up the brutal realities of what this relationship was founded upon: the colonization of the archipelago by the United States. This erasure continues to shape silences in the relationship, impeding fights for justice and redress across the Pacific.\n\nIn 1896, after more than 330 years of colonization by Spain, native people in the archipelago took up arms against their colonial rulers in what became known as the Philippine Revolution. In 1898, taking advantage of the rapid decline of the Spanish Empire, the United States offered military assistance to revolutionaries in Cuba and the Philippines, with promises to insurgents that it, an expanding world power, would recognize native-led independence movements.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis series of interventions led to the Spanish-American War between April 21 and Aug. 13, 1898, and the decisive American military victory that followed. However, instead of recognizing the newly-declared First Philippine Republic, the United States purchased Spain’s former island colonies in the Treaty of Paris for a total of $20 million. After this betrayal of trust, the leaders of the republic declared war against the United States, their former ally.\n\nWhat followed was brutality that remains largely erased from American historical memory. During the Philippine-American War (1899-1902), an estimated 20,000 Filipino soldiers and 200,000 to 1 million civilians died before the United States declared the conflict over. Even then, from 1902 to the mid-1910s, revolutionary movements proliferated against the new occupying power. As historians have argued, the Philippine-American War may very well not have ended in 1902, but rather took on a new name: counterinsurgency.\n\nIn 1934, amid a wave of anti-Filipino racism on the U.S. West Coast, Congress passed the Tydings-McDuffie Act, which capped migration from the Philippines into the continental United States at 50 people a year, even though the country was under U.S. rule.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn exchange, the Philippines would become a commonwealth, a provisionally self-governing nation for 10 years, before being granted full independence. The following year, in the presence of American and Filipino colleagues, President Franklin D. Roosevelt ratified the 1935 Constitution of the Philippine Commonwealth, modeled after the U.S. Constitution. During World War II, the Japanese occupied the Philippines in 1942, another violent period of colonization declared by an imperial power under the guise of liberation. After evacuating in March 1942, Gen. Douglas MacArthur — who had served as the military adviser to the Commonwealth of the Philippines — invaded the island of Leyte in October 1944. By January 1945, the United States occupied Manila once again, and reclaimed their Southeast Asian military and economic outpost.\n\nThese wartime aims previewed American-Philippine foreign relations in the immediate decades after the war. After World War II, on July 4, 1946, the United States granted independence to the Philippines. But the legacies of prior American involvement in the archipelago did not disappear. Various economic treaties guaranteed that, in exchange for American financial support for postwar redevelopment, the Philippines would allow U.S. companies and citizens rights to the islands’ natural resources, as well as free use of military zones on the archipelago. In effect, despite formal independence, the Philippines remained a neocolony of the United States.\n\nU.S. colonial statecraft gave the juridical precedent for the seizure of power by the Marcoses. On Sept. 23, 1972, Ferdinand Marcos Sr. declared that the Philippines would be subject to martial law. He pointed to Article VII, Section 10 of the 1935 Constitution, which was still in effect. It granted the president — as commander in chief — discretionary powers to declare martial law as a preventive measure against “lawless violence, invasion, insurrection, or rebellion.” These provisions stem from the early American colonization of the Philippines, in which military occupation was at the heart of counterinsurgency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCiting threats to his rule across the political spectrum, Marcos suspended habeas corpus and seized control of Congress, effectively granting himself authoritarian powers in perpetuity. In tandem with martial law, he declared his rule to be a new epoch in Philippine history, which he called the New Society.\n\nThe discretionary powers afforded to Marcos under martial law did not only pertain to governance, but also applied to all aspects of Philippine society. The regime swiftly suspended the free press, imprisoned Marcos’s political opponents and subjected Filipinos to curfews and strict surveillance. Those who were deemed dissidents were subjected to torture and abuse; an estimated 70,000 people were incarcerated and about 3,257 victims “disappeared” through extrajudicial killings.\n\nBy the 1980s, the Marcos regime’s hold on the Philippines began to wane. The president’s health began to decline, and his wife, Imelda Marcos, emerged as the new figurehead. In 1983, the regime’s popularity sharply dropped after the assassination of opposition leader Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino Jr. After several failed coups and impeachments, through mass mobilization, the People Power Revolution of 1986 ousted Marcos and his family from national politics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Manila’s citizens took to streets in support of his opponent, Corazon Aquino, the Marcoses fled the Philippines with the help of their country’s former colonial master, the United States.\n\nAboard a U.S. Air Force C-130, the Marcos family and their cronies fled the Philippines to Anderson Air Force Base in Guam, then found sanctuary in Honolulu, another U.S. outpost in the Pacific. The family took much of their stolen plunder (including jewelry, cash and rare artworks) with them, and their wealth is now estimated to be over $10 billion. Despite litigation, a federal commission to retrieve stolen wealth and a tax bill of $3.9 billion, most of the money has not been recovered.\n\nOver the years, the United States and the Philippines maintained their mutually beneficial relationship as “partners.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Nov. 20, 2001, two months after the fall of the twin towers, President George W. Bush met with then-Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to fortify U.S. military interests in the Philippines. Citing a strong “people-to-people” relationship between Filipino Americans’ love for the United States and the Philippine people’s shared commitment to this trans-Pacific partnership, Arroyo declared: “Long live the Philippines, and long live the friendship between the United States and the Philippines.”\n\nFormer strongman president Rodrigo Duterte, who was publicly anti-American and expressed his disdain for President Barack Obama, found much in common with his admirer, President Donald Trump. In 2020, Duterte voiced his support for his American counterpart, declaring him to be a “good president [who] deserves to be reelected.”\n\nAnd despite the election fraud and intimidation that facilitated Marcos Jr.’s ascension to the presidency — and wide protests calling out the lack of integrity in the electoral process — on May 11 Biden congratulated the new administration on the victory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut we must remember that the basis of the U.S.-Philippine “special relationship” is the erasure of colonial history. That on the 50th anniversary of martial law, the United Nations, the Biden administration and the Asia Society have welcomed an ill-begotten president with open arms, signaling the strength of this historical amnesia — and the troubling future of Philippine politics and civic life.\n\nThe ongoing fight for justice across the Pacific — for the repressed legacies of the American campaign of extermination in the Philippines in the early 20th century, to the survivors of martial law under Ferdinand Marcos Sr., to the victims of extrajudicial killings under Duterte’s so-called “War on Drugs” — takes place on the battleground of historical memory. For the sake of redress and social justice, we must remember.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

    "As Philippines’ Marcos Speaks Before UN, a Few Reminders": "Click to expand Image Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. speaks as the New York Stock Exchange, New York, September 19, 2022. © 2022 AP Photo/Seth Wenig\n\nWhen President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. speaks before the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Wednesday, September 21, expect that he will present the same misleading picture of human rights in the Philippines that he has been hawking to the international community since he won the election in July. Amidst mischaracterizations of the rights situation, there are several things UN member countries should keep in mind.\n\nMarcos’s predecessor, President Rodrigo Duterte, set the human rights bar in the Philippines so low that even if Marcos does nothing, he looks like a more rights-respecting leader. And that’s exactly what he has done so far – nothing – when it comes to improving human rights in the Philippines.\n\nMarcos has not stopped Duterte’s brutal “war on drugs,” which has led to thousands being killed by police, police agents, or unidentified assailants. In fact, instead of ordering the police and other law enforcement agents to stand down, Marcos recently vowed to continue the antidrug campaign. Unsurprisingly, his government has given no indication that accountability for police abuses is forthcoming.\n\nThe Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) has also apparently concluded that serious national investigations and prosecutions of rights violations during the “war on drugs” will not be forthcoming. After a deferral request by the Philippines Department of Justice in November 2021, the ICC suspended its investigation of drug war killings. But in June, the ICC prosecutor requested court permission to resume his office’s investigation.\n\nMarcos has repeatedly stated that he will not cooperate with the ICC and the Philippines will not rejoin the Rome Statute that created the court.\n\nIf Marcos was serious about improving human rights in the country, he would nominate a competent and independent chairperson and commissioners to the currently vacant national Commission on Human Rights. Marcos should also drop the charges and release former Senator Leila de Lima, who was arrested five years ago on bogus charges.\n\nMeanwhile, “drug war” violence rages on, progressive activists and independent journalists remain targets for violence and threats, government disinformation is rampant, and the democratic space in the Philippines is increasingly constrained.\n\nUN members should resist swallowing the sugarcoated banalities about human rights that Marcos can be expected to utter. The human rights situation in the Philippines remains poor, and so far, Marcos has shown no inclination to substantively change it.",
    "UN Rights Office Slams Abuses in Philippines": "Click to expand Image Emily Soriano, holding a picture of her 15-year-old son who was gunned down in Manila in 2016, says she is turning to the International Criminal Court after failing for years to attain justice in the Philippines, June 2022. © 2022 Aaron Favila/AP Photo\n\nThe United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) released a report on September 13 calling on the Philippine government to address serious gaps on human rights, particularly regarding accountability for abuses linked to the “war on drugs.” The report highlighted several achievements of the UN and Philippines joint program on human rights, but underscored that impunity for rights violations and police abuses persists.\n\nThe Office of the High Commissioner said that it “continued to receive allegations of human rights violations by members of the Philippine National Police,” adding that “deaths continue to be reported in anti-illegal drug operations.” Since the “drug war” began in 2016, the government has itself reported that police killed more than 6,200 people in anti-drug operations, while OHCHR previously put the figure at more than 8,600. Domestic human rights groups estimate the “drug war” toll, including killings by unidentified gunmen, at three times the government figure. Virtually all of these killings remain uninvestigated.\n\nThe Office of the High Commissioner also said it “continued to receive reports of killings, arbitrary detention, physical and legal intimidation” against human rights defenders. It said these individuals are often targets of “red-tagging,” the longtime government practice of accusing activists of supporting the communist insurgency, putting them at risk of attack and arbitrary arrest.\n\nThe OHCHR report corroborated human rights groups’ findings that abuses have persisted even since the UN joint program started more than a year ago. Last week, Human Rights Watch submitted a policy paper to members of the UN Human Rights Council supporting a resolution to continue its rights monitoring and reporting mandate on the Philippines.\n\nThe OHCHR cited key obstacles to enforcing the UN joint program, including “limited oversight of human rights investigations, inadequate investigation capacity and inter-agency cooperation, limited forensic capacity and protracted judicial processes.” It also noted “inadequate victim and witness support and protection, and fear of reprisals” that undermine victims’ engagement in the program. Among the office’s recommendations is the need for “further progress on accountability.”\n\nWhat’s clear from the report is that the UN’s work on the Philippines is far from done. The Human Rights Council should adopt OHCHR’s recommendation that the high commissioner’s office continue to monitor and regularly report on the country’s rights situation. There’s no short-term solution to making real progress on accountability and providing justice for people in the Philippines.",
    "Marcos wants to ‘reintroduce’ Philippines": "Marcos wants to ‘reintroduce’ Philippines\n\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. speaks during an interview with The Associated Press, Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, in New York. (AP Photo/Julia\n\nLooking to “reintroduce the Philippines” to the world, new President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has ambitious plans for his nation on the international stage and at home — if, that is, the twin specters of pandemic and climate change can be overcome or at least managed.\n\nAnd if he can surmount the legacies of two people: his predecessor, and his father.\n\nHe also wants to strengthen ties with both the United States and China — a delicate balancing act for the Southeast Asian nation — and, like many of his fellow leaders at the United Nations this week, called on the countries that have caused global warming to help less wealthy nations counteract its effects.\n\nMarcos, swept into office this spring, is already drawing distinctions both subtle and obvious between himself and his voluble predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, who alienated many international partners with his violent approach to fighting drug trafficking and the coarse rhetoric he used to galvanize supporters.\n\nAsked if Duterte went too far with his lethal drug crackdown, Marcos redirected the criticism toward those who carried out the plan.\n\n“His people went too far sometimes,” Marcos told The Associated Press on Friday. “We have seen many cases where policemen, other operatives, some were just shady characters that we didn’t quite know where they came from and who they were working for. But now we’ve gone after them.”\n\nMarcos, 65, sat for a wide-ranging interview in New York on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly’s annual leaders’ meeting. Three months into his administration, he seemed energetic and enthusiastic — and eager to project his vision for the nation beyond its borders.\n\nOn Thursday, he met with U.S. President Joe Biden in a bid to strengthen the sometimes complicated ties that have ebbed and flowed between the two nations since the Philippines spent four decades as an American colony in the early 20th century.\n\n“There have been bits and pieces where they were not perhaps ideal,” Marcos said. “But in the end, that overall trajectory has been to strengthen and strengthen and strengthen our relationship.”\n\nIn addition to Duterte, Marcos also must draw distinctions between himself and the most iconic figure in the Philippines’ public sphere: his late father, whose name he shares. Ferdinand Marcos Sr., hero to some and plundering dictator to others, ruled from the 1960s to the 1980s, including a tumultuous period of martial law and repression. He made the family reputation an indelible part of Filipino history.\n\nAddressing the family legacy directly is something the son has been loath to do, at least explicitly, though he vehemently rejects use of the term “dictator” to describe his father’s rule, To him, the political baggage of his parents is a remnant of the past.\n\n“I did not indulge in any of that political back-and-forth concerning the Marcos family,” he said. “All I spoke about was, ‘What are we going to do to get into a better place?’ And people responded.”\n\nEngaging, he said, would have simply been a retread — and an unnecessary one. “It doesn’t help. It doesn’t change anything,” he said. “So what’s the point?”\n\nThe elder Marcos placed the Philippines under martial law in 1972, a year before his term was to expire. He padlocked Congress and newspaper offices, ordered the arrest of political opponents and activists and ruled by decree. Thousands of Filipinos disappeared under his rule; some have never been accounted for.\n\nWhen it comes to his predecessor, Marcos treads a nuanced political line as well. Distinguishing himself from Duterte’s in-your-face rule can benefit him at home and internationally, but Duterte’s popularity helped catapult him into office, and the former president’s daughter Sara is Marcos’ vice president.\n\nThe extrajudicial killings associated with Duterte’s yearslong crackdown provoked calls that his administration should be investigated from the outside, and he vowed not to rejoin the International Criminal Court — a precept that Marcos agrees with. After all, Marcos asked, why should a country with a functioning legal system be judged from elsewhere?\n\n“We have a judiciary. It’s not perfect,” he said. “I do not understand why we need an outside adjudicator to tell us how to investigate, who to investigate, how to go about it.”\n\nMarcos cast the coronavirus pandemic as many other leaders have — as a balancing act between keeping people safe and making sure life can push forward.\n\n“We took a very extreme position in the Philippines, and we eventually had the longest lockdown in any country in the world,” he said. “That was the choice of the previous government. And now, we are now coming out of it.”\n\nIn recent days, he has both removed a national mandate to wear masks outdoors and extended a “state of calamity” — something he said he didn’t necessarily want to do, but keeping the declaration in place allows more people to continue getting help.\n\n“It’s not very encouraging when people look at your country and they see, ‘Well, it’s under a state of calamity.’ That’s not good for tourists. It’s not good for visitors. It’s not good for business,” Marcos said.\n\nEncouraging ties with China, particularly given Beijing’s aggressive maritime policies, might be a daunting prospect for a nation so closely and historically aligned with the United States. But, Marcos says, it’s possible — and necessary.\n\n“It is a very fine line that we have to tread in the Philippines,” the president said. “We do not subscribe to the old Cold War ‘spheres of influence.’ … So it’s really guided by national interest, number one. And second, the maintenance of peace.”\n\nPeace comes in many flavors. Last week, Marcos traveled to the southern part of the nation — a predominantly Muslim area of a predominantly Catholic country — to express support for a multiyear effort to help a onetime rebel group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, give up their guns and govern their autonomous region effectively.\n\nWhile Moro has come into the government fold, smaller militant groups including the violent Abu Sayyaf have continued to fight the government and wage sporadic attacks, especially in impoverished rural regions with weak law enforcement. Marcos dismissed Abu Sayyaf as a group that no longer has a cause other than “banditry.”\n\n“I don’t believe they are a movement anymore. They are not fighting for anything,” Marcos said. “They are just criminals.”\n\nMarcos did not specify precisely why the Philippines needed to be reintroduced, though the country’s image took a hit from 2016 to 2022 under the Duterte administration.\n\n“The purpose, really, that I have brought to this visit here in New York … has been to try to reintroduce the Philippines to our American friends, both in the private sector and in the public sector,” he said.\n\nAnd after the pandemic truly ends, he said, the nation needs to find a fruitful path and follow it.\n\n“We have to position ourselves. We have to be clever about forecasting, being a bit prescient,” he said.\n\n“We do not want to return to whatever it is we were doing pre-pandemic,” Marcos said. “We want to be able to be involved and be a vital part of the new global economy, of the new global political situation.”",
    "Philippine Protesters Vow to 'Never Forget' Marcos Era Abuses": "Philippine protesters vowed Wednesday to \"never forget\" the human rights abuses under former dictator Ferdinand Marcos as they held rallies to mark 50 years since his imposition of martial law.\n\nAmnesty International estimates thousands of people were killed and tens of thousands tortured and imprisoned after Marcos imposed martial law on September 21, 1972, unleashing security forces on rivals, critics and dissidents.\n\nMarcos's son is now the president of the Philippines, and campaigners have urged him to recognize his family's role in the violence.\n\n\"The Marcoses need to at least acknowledge their role in those dark days,\" said Carlos Conde, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, as activists and victims marked the 50th anniversary.\n\n\"Without truth-telling, without the space for Filipinos to understand and accept what happened during martial law, we can never find closure, we can never move forward.\"\n\nHundreds of protesters, including human rights activists and Christian groups, held peaceful demonstrations across the capital Manila, carrying placards with slogans such as \"never again\" and images of martial law victims.\n\n\"A nation that doesn't remember its history is doomed to repeat it as they say,\" said John Magtibay, a 22-year-old film student protesting at the University of the Philippines.\n\n\"We are beginning to see that now.\"\n\nHalf a century after martial law began, 11,103 people have been officially recognized as victims of torture, killings, enforced disappearances and other abuses.\n\nThey have been compensated with some of the wealth — estimated to be in the billions of dollars — stolen by Marcos and his wife Imelda.\n\nBut human rights groups say there has never been a true reckoning of the abuses -- or those responsible held to account.\n\nMarcos was toppled from power by a bloodless \"people power\" revolt in 1986 and the family was chased into exile.\n\nAfter the patriarch's death in 1989, they returned to the Philippines and began a remarkable political comeback that culminated with Ferdinand Marcos Jr's victory in the May 9 presidential election.\n\n\"The fact that we allowed the Marcoses to re-enter Malacanang is really messed up,\" said Patricia Pobre, a 24-year-old protester, referring to the presidential palace.\n\n‘One of the darkest periods'\n\nHis landslide win was helped by a massive online misinformation campaign that whitewashed abuses and corruption during the dictatorship.\n\nMartial law victims and activists have described the Marcos regime as \"one of the darkest periods\" in the country's history.\n\nThey accuse Marcos Jr and his supporters of distorting the facts about martial law and falsely portraying it as a \"golden age\" for the Philippines.\n\n\"There are young Filipinos who are interested in learning what really happened in spite of many others who were really blinded,\" said former political prisoner Bonnie Ilagan, who spent two years in jail where he was repeatedly tortured.\n\n\"The fight continues. We must never forget.\"\n\nIlagan and others accused Marcos's allies in Congress of slashing budgets and weakening the government agencies responsible for preserving the nation's past.\n\nIn the run-up to Wednesday's anniversary, documentary screenings and exhibitions have been held to educate the public about the horrors of martial law.\n\nBut a left-wing political party said they were forced to scrap a film screening in suburban Manila on Tuesday after five members of the local police intelligence unit showed up and \"harassed\" them and \"shot video.\"\n\nMarcos Jr, who has repeatedly praised his father's rule, last week defended martial law as \"necessary\" to protect the country against communist and Muslim insurgencies.\n\n\"We do recognize the problems that happened, the abuses that occurred like in any war,\" Marcos Jr said.\n\nBut he said critics were \"wrong\" to call his father a \"dictator.\"\n\n\"There's no reason to revise history,\" he said, while suggesting school textbooks need to be rewritten \"only if they're wrong.\"\n\nCristina Palabay of the Karapatan human rights alliance accused Marcos Jr and his administration of peddling \"one lie after another.\"\n\n\"There needs to be institutionalized acknowledgement and great reckoning on the crimes committed by Marcos and his ilk,\" she said.",

Let’s Make It Happen in the Philippines,”he said.\n\nPascual acknowledged the influential role of the US in boosting business confidence in the Philippines.\n\n“The economies of our two countries have strong and synergetic trade and investment relations. The US is our top export market and our fifth import supplier. Our trade in goods consists of high-technology commodities such as semiconductors, integrated circuits, and wiring harnesses, and others,”Pascual said.\n\nHe said investments coming from the US for the first semester of the year have been more diversified compared to the previous year, explaining that approved US investments come from various sectors such as information and communication, and manufacturing industries.",

    "The Philippines: UN human rights report looks to new administration for progress on accountability and reforms": "GENEVA (13 Sept 2022) – Amid continuing reports of human rights violations and abuses in the Philippines, including in the context of anti-drug operations, victims still face challenges in seeking justice, a UN report published today finds.\n\nIn the report, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights acknowledges the Government’s commitment to cooperate with the UN human rights mechanisms, including through an innovative UN joint programme on human rights that is being implemented with Government agencies, the national human rights institution and civil society.\n\nThe Joint Programme, signed in July 2021, provides technical assistance and capacity-building for reforms in six key areas, including: domestic investigative and accountability measures; data gathering on alleged police violations; the establishment of a national mechanism for reporting and follow-up; civic space and engagement with civil society and the Commission on Human Rights; counter-terrorism legislation; and human rights-based approaches to drug control.\n\nThe report, mandated by Human Rights Council resolution 45/33, calls for the new Philippines administration to adopt a transformative approach that looks to rights-based solutions for critical issues, including drug law enforcement and counter- terrorism, and to end divisive rhetoric that puts human rights defenders at risk.\n\nWhile acknowledging some progress in a number of areas, the report notes that considerable challenges remain.\n\n“The Government took some initiatives to advance accountability for human rights violations and abuses… However, access to justice for victims of human rights violations and abuses remained very limited. Institutional and structural shortcomings in law enforcement and the judiciary remained, despite efforts to address some cases,” it says.\n\nSpecifically, the report highlights “limited oversight of human rights investigations, inadequate investigation capacity and inter-agency cooperation, limited forensic capacity and protracted judicial processes”. Inadequate support and protection for victims and witnesses, as well as fear of reprisals, also affects victims’ engagement.\n\nTo address these concerns, the report recommends that the Interagency Review Panel, established by the Department of Justice, should accelerate its review of all killings related to the Government’s anti-drug operations. The Panel should also ensure that relevant findings are acted on promptly, including through internal administrative and criminal processes.\n\nWhile some cases have been investigated, these have so far not resulted in convictions and redress for victims.\n\nThe report calls on the Government to revise drug legislation and policies in line with human rights norms and international guidelines on human rights and drug policy; to revisit the mandatory penalties for drug offences; and to consider the decriminalization of drug possession for personal use.\n\nThe report also recommends that the Government pass proposed legislation on human rights defenders, and implement measures to protect civic space for them to be able to play their legitimate role securely and without reprisals.\n\nCritically, it calls on the Government to take all necessary steps to ensure the continued independence of the Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines, including through a transparent and consultative appointment process for Commissioners in line with the Paris Principles.\n\nThe report calls on the Human Rights Council to support the UN Joint Programme and to continue to monitor the situation closely, including progress on accountability.\n\nENDS",
    "Court Denies Philippine Government Attempt to Declare Communist Party a ‘Terrorist’ Group": "The ruling by Judge Marlo Magdoza-Malagar stated that the New People’s Army used violence as a means rather than an end.\n\nPatriotic Youths group protesters rally to commemorate the 49th anniversary of the New People’s Army, the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines, in Manila, Philippines on March 21, 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA court in the Philippine capital Manila has dismissed a Department of Justice (DOJ) petition seeking to declare the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and its armed wing as “terrorist” groups. In a ruling that was signed on Wednesday, Manila regional trial court Judge Marlo Magdoza-Malagar argued that the CPP and its armed wing, the New People’s Army (NPA), did not fulfill the criteria necessary to make such a designation.\n\nAmong the several lines of reasoning advanced in the ruling, one was that the groups were engaged in a rebellion rather than terrorism. Another was that the use of violence was their means rather than their end.\n\n“While the armed struggle with the violence that necessarily accompanies it is indubitably the approved means to achieve the CPP-NPA’s purpose, means is not synonymous with purpose,” stated the ruling, according to a report by BenarNews. “Armed struggle is only a means to achieve the CPP’s purpose; it is not the purpose of the creation of the CPP.”\n\nThe ruling added that “while both rebellion and terrorism may involve the use of violence, the violence in rebellion is directed against government or any part thereof,” rather than being designed “to sow and create a condition of widespread and extraordinary fear and panic among the populace.”\n\nDiplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.

Just $5 a month.\n\nThe move is a setback for the DOJ, which filed the petition in 2018. If approved, it would have been granted additional powers to rifle through the bank accounts of members and leaders of the CPP-NPA.\n\nIt is a legal victory of equal magnitude for activists and government critics, though a somewhat Pyrrhic one. As the BenarNews report explains, the DOJ’s initial petition cited the Human Security Act of 2007 as a basis – a law that was repealed in 2020 with the Philippines’ adoption of the controversial Anti-Terror Act. The government can still seek to have the groups declared “terrorist” under this new law, even as it appeals this week’s verdict.\n\nBut Magdoza-Malagar’s ruling was significant in setting a precedent that any other ruling will have to take into account. It also raised concerns about “red-tagging,” a practice in which senior officials link political activists to communist insurgents, exposing them to arrest or violent attacks. While not posing an existential threat to the Philippine government, the persistence of the CPP-NPA insurgency has offered officials a convenient way of smearing government critics and discrediting movements for social and economic justice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the advocacy group Human Rights Watch (HRW), the practice of “red-tagging” became much deadlier under President Rodrigo Duterte, who was in office from 2016 until this past June. Duterte created the National Task Force on Ending Local Communist Armed Conflict, staffed with and headed by former military officials. According to HRW, the task force engaged in frequent red-tagging – of activists, critics, and left-wing political leaders – through its social media posts and official pronouncements.\n\nThis week’s court ruling described red-tagging as a “pernicious practice” that endangered government critics, and called on the government to show “respect for the right to dissent, to due process, and to the rule of law.”",

    "Philippines: Strong UN Human Rights Council Action Needed": "Click to expand Image Progressive groups protest during the inauguration of Ferdinand Marcos Jr. as president of the Philippines, in Manila, June 30, 2022. © 2022 Sipa via AP Images\n\n(Geneva) – The United Nations Human Rights Council should adopt a strong resolution addressing the dire human rights situation in the Philippines during its 51st session, which starts September 12, 2022, Human Rights Watch said today.\n\nIn a policy paper submitted to UN member states, Human Rights Watch said that extrajudicial killings in the Philippine government’s “war on drugs” still occur on a regular basis. Dahas, a program of the Third World Studies Center of the University of the Philippines, has reported 72 drug-related killings after President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. took office on June 30. Official government figures indicate that the police killed 71 people since August 2021, bringing the total number of killings reported by the police between July 2016 and May 2022 to 6,252. President Marcos has not repudiated abuses in the “drug war,” which he said he would continue.\n\n“UN member states should not be fooled by the baseless claims from the new Philippine government that the rights situation has suddenly improved,” said Lucy McKernan, Geneva director at Human Rights Watch. “Continued UN scrutiny of the Philippines is vitally important because ‘drug war’ killings are still common and police impunity for rights violations remains the norm.”\n\nThe Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) calculated in its report to the Council that the death toll was at least 8,663. Domestic human rights groups and the government appointed Philippines Commission on Human Rights state that the real figure of “drug war” killings is possibly triple the number reported in the OHCHR report.\n\nSince the “drug war” began in July 2016 under former President Rodrigo Duterte, the authorities have investigated very few killings implicating the police or alleged government agents. Only 12 police officers have been indicted and only one case, the video-recorded murder of 17-year-old Kian delos Santos in August 2017, resulted in the conviction of police officers.\n\nThe prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) was authorized in late 2021 to investigate alleged crimes against humanity in the “drug war.” In November, the ICC paused the investigation after the Justice Department provided information to the court claiming that the department was conducting a serious independent review of 52 cases involving the police. In June, the ICC prosecutor asked the court to allow his inquiry to continue because the Justice Department review was insufficient and failed to satisfy the requirements to defer the ICC investigation.\n\nOther grave abuses are also continuing, including harassment and extrajudicial killings of activists, environmentalists, journalists, and other human rights defenders, Human Rights Watch said. A long-running “red-tagging” campaign, in which government officials accuse people of links to the armed communist insurgency, further constricts fundamental freedoms and puts those targeted at grave risk of assault or arrest.\n\nPresident Marcos should take immediate steps to improve the human rights situation, Human Rights Watch said. He should release former Senator Leila de Lima, who has been held in police detention for more than six years on spurious drug charges. And he should appoint independent human rights experts as commissioners to the government Commission on Human Rights so that it can investigate and help prosecute human rights violations.\n\nIn 2020, the Human Rights Council passed a resolution that created the UN Joint Program to improve the capacity of Philippine institutions to protect human rights. But more than a year into the three-year program, it is still grappling with organizational and administrative issues, including government actions to thwart the participation of civil society organizations.\n\nUN member states at the Human Rights Council should recognize that the persistence of the human rights crisis in the Philippines makes it important to adopt a strong resolution during the 51st session, Human Rights Watch said. The resolution should create expanded human rights monitoring mechanisms and continue the UN Joint Program. The resolution should explicitly request continued reporting by the OHCHR on the situation in the country.\n\nSuch a resolution should call on President Marcos to unequivocally end the “war on drugs” and to prioritize accountability for unlawful killings and other abuses. It should urge the government to form a “truth commission” that will gather testimony from witnesses and victims and their families and make recommendations for achieving justice and ensuring payment of reparations.\n\nThe resolution should also call for stopping the practice of “red-tagging” activists and critics of the government, and halting the harassment of journalists and online activists with threats of arrests or criminal libel cases. It should also urge Marcos to release de Lima, to name independent human rights experts to the Commission on Human Rights, and to facilitate the full participation of civil society organizations in the UN Joint Program.\n\n“UN member states should make sure they don’t drop the ball on the Philippines and instead strengthen the Human Rights Council’s efforts to improve human rights in the country,” McKernan said. “Filipinos who suffered the most during the Duterte administration are looking to the Human Rights Council to help them achieve justice for themselves and their loved ones.”\n\n\n\nTo read the policy paper submitted to the member-states of the UN Human Rights Council ahead of the Council's 51st session, please click here.",

Vendor from Marikina Pulic market said cannot control because of low supplies caused by delivery problem.\n\nMANILA, Philippines — Domestic economic growth is expected to leave more room for the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas to continue normalizing monetary policy amid a projected global recession and persisting headwinds, according to a Fitch unit.\n\nIn an emailed commentary on Monday, Fitch Solutions noted their upgraded projection of 6.6% gross domestic product this year will allow the BSP to keep raising its key policy rate.\n\n“We believe that the Philippines' strong economic recovery will provide more room for the BSP to normalise its monetary policy,” the Fitch unit said.\n\nThe central bank kicked off its tightening cycle in May, believing the domestic economy would require less support because of eased pandemic curbs. This has led to an improvement in household spending in past months that was muted in the past two years due to strict quarantine measures.\n\nThat said, the domestic economy’s reopening left consumer prices and services skyrocketing to their highest pace since the pandemic, due in part to ramped-up demand and expensive fuel prices.\n\nInterest rates currently stood at 4.25% after the BSP’s hike last September 22.\n\nThe BSP’s rate hikes since May were done to tame rising inflation.\n\nFitch Solution’s revised GDP projection is higher than the 5.7% recorded last year, considering external headwinds on growth according to Fitch Solutions.\n\n“While we expect growth to likely slow in H222 due to an array of economic headwinds stemming from a softening global economic outlook, tightening monetary conditions, and elevated energy prices, the 2022 economic performance would still be a substantial improvement over the 5.6% recorded in 2021,” the Fitch unit said.\n\nThe BSP explained last week that growth will not be hampered as a result of the rate hikes, since demand is firming up already.\n\nBanks use the BSP’s policy rate, which was slashed at the onset of the pandemic to encourage credit growth, as a benchmark when they lend to consumers and businesses.",
    "Hailing the Philippines as a Pioneer in Children’s Participation, Experts of the Committee on the Rights of the Child Also Ask about Levels of Violence in the Country": "The Committee on the Rights of the Child today concluded its consideration of the fifth and sixth combined periodic report of the Philippines under the Convention of the Rights of the Child. Committee Experts commended the State as a pioneer in child participation, and also asked about the high levels of violence to which children were exposed, particularly in the war on drugs.\n\nCommittee Experts said the Philippines was a pioneer when it came to children’s participation, which was very positive. What was being done to ensure that children were truly involved in all matters relating to them? Could more information be provided on child participation when it came to addressing climate change? Committee Experts also noted that violence against children was a big issue, with over 80 per cent of children being exposed to violence in the home and elsewhere. The review of the plan to combat violence against children showed that violence had increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. What else did the review show? What measures had been taken to provide support and psychological assistance to orphaned children? What measures had been taken to protect the victims and child witnesses of violence, particularly in the war on drugs?\n\nIntroducing the report, Angelo M. Tapales, Executive Director, Council for the Welfare of Children and head of the delegation, said three nationwide children's consultations had been conducted in 2022. The Guidebook on Child Participation in the Philippines was enhanced and used to standardise the conduct of those consultations. Furthermore, the 2017-2022 National Strategic Plan on Child Participation in the Philippines had been developed to strengthen the promotion of child participation in the family, community, school, media, and other institutions. The Magna Carta of Children, a comprehensive children’s human rights law, was envisioned to be enacted in 2025, and would usher in the creation of the Philippine Commission on Children and the Child Ombudsman. In the administration of juvenile justice, several policies were formulated and adopted, including a Protocol and Process flow chart for handling children involved in dangerous drugs. The Philippines was pleased to present milestones and share best practices in the dialogue and looked forward to the Committee’s constructive observations and recommendations.\n\nIn closing remarks, Clarence Nelson, Committee Expert and Taskforce Coordinator for the Philippines, thanked the delegation for the frank exchange of information and ideas. The Committee was happy that the State was making progress in its legislation and hoped that would continue.\n\nMr. Tapales said the Philippines had come a long way regarding children’s rights protection, but knew that more could be done. The observations of the Committee regarding the issues facing the children in the country would all be taken to heart, and the Government would take all necessary steps to address those concerns.\n\nThe delegation of the Philippines consisted of representatives from the Council for the Welfare of Children; the Presidential Human Rights Committee Secretariat; the Philippine Commission on Women; the Juvenile Justice and Welfare Council; the Regional Trial Court Branch, The Court of Appeals; the Department of Social Welfare and Development; the Department of Justice; the Department of Health; the Department of Foreign Affairs; the Office of the Court Administrator; the Philippine National Police; the Presidential Human Rights Commission Secretariat; and the Permanent Mission of the Philippines to the United Nations Office at Geneva.\n\nThe Committee will issue the concluding observations on the report of Viet Nam at the end of its ninety-first session on 23 September. Those, and other documents relating to the Committee’s work, including reports submitted by States parties, will be available on the session’s webpage.\n\nSummaries of the public meetings of the Committee can be found here, while webcasts of the public meetings can be found here. The programme of work of the Committee’s ninety-first session and other documents related to the session can be found here.\n\nThe Committee will next meet in public at 3 p.m. this afternoon to consider the combined third to sixth periodic report of Kuwait (CRC/C/KWT/3-6).\n\nReport\n\nThe Committee has before it the combined fifth and sixth periodic reports of the Philippines (CRC/C/PHL/5-6).\n\nPresentation of Report\n\nANGELO M. TAPALES, Executive Director, Council for the Welfare of Children and head of the delegation, greeted the Committee on behalf of the 44 million Filipino children. Innovative mechanisms had been established to mitigate the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children. Those included the activated hotline numbers and online complaint desks for reporting and responding to incidents of violence against children, and the first long-term Basic Education Development Plan 2030. Laws enacted at the height of the pandemic included a law prohibiting online sexual abuse or exploitation of children, and the proliferation of exploitation materials; the law prohibiting child marriage in the Philippines; and the expanded anti-Trafficking in Persons Act, among others. Those new laws enhanced the 29 child-rights protection laws enacted during the period of reporting.\n\nThree nationwide children's consultations had been conducted in 2022. The Guidebook on Child Participation in the Philippines was enhanced and used to standardise the conduct of those consultations. Furthermore, the 2017-2022 National Strategic Plan on Child Participation in the Philippines had been developed to strengthen the promotion of child participation in the family, community, school, media, and other institutions. The Magna Carta of Children, a comprehensive children’s human rights law, was envisioned to be enacted in 2025, and would usher in the creation of the Philippine Commission on Children and the Child Ombudsman.\n\nMr. Tapales said that the State rendered Government services more inclusive and gender-responsive through several facets, including by strengthening the system for prevention, early identification, referral and intervention in developmental delays and disabilities in early childhood. In 2017, a gender-responsive education policy had been developed, to protect children from discrimination, among other goals. The Government had also rolled out a “budget tagging system” for children, which determined the budget allocation of local government units dedicated to programmes for children. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government also addressed issues regarding children’s health and child abuse through the development of the “Health, Nutrition and Child Protection Referral Pathway,” which provided a basic guide on the flow of reporting and referral of cases of child abuse and health concerns during the pandemic.\n\nIn the administration of juvenile justice, the State had established a Comprehensive National Juvenile Intervention Programme, which served as a roadmap to ensure the full implementation of the juvenile justice and welfare law. Several policies were formulated and adopted, including a Protocol and Process flow chart for handling children involved in dangerous drugs. The judiciary also introduced innovations to render courts more child-friendly, to protect children from trauma when providing testimonies. Judges and court personnel, as well as prosecutors, public defenders, and law enforcement officers undertook continuous child and gender-sensitivity training by the Philippine Judicial Academy.\n\nThe Philippines’ continuing advocacy on child rights protection was translated into policies and programmes pursued under the Philippine Human Rights Plan. The plan directed the implementation of child responsive programmes; a legislative agenda on children’s participation and welfare; an effective mechanism for inter-agency coordination; and a functional monitoring, evaluation, and reporting system. The Philippines was pleased to present milestones and share best practices in the dialogue and looked forward to the Committee’s constructive observations and recommendations.\n\nQuestions by Committee Experts\n\nCLARENCE NELSON, Committee Expert and Taskforce Coordinator for the Philippines, said the Committee was pleased to hear about progress made in passing legislation, especially regarding child marriage and online abuse. The report discussed 29 laws in total; what measures were being taken to implement those laws? Was the anti-corporal punishment bill going to be resubmitted to Parliament? Could the delegation comment on the intent to reduce the age of criminal responsibility? Why was there a differentiation between the punishment for the rape of girls and the rape of boys? Would a new national action plan be drawn up at the expiration of the current one this year? How transparent were the accountability and spending processes of the Government? General corruption was a matter of concern; what happened to the Anti-Corruption Commission? Were there other anti-corruption measures used to combat that problem? The Committee welcomed efforts the Philippines had made to improve its data collection system. Did the Government have access to disaggregated data? What measures were taken to combat the drop in reporting which had occurred after the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\nViolence against children was a big issue, with over 80 per cent of children being exposed to violence in the home and elsewhere. The review of the plan to combat violence against children showed that violence had increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. What else did the review show? The plan did not address areas including online violence; could the delegation comment on that? When would the plan be rolled out on a national basis? There was a low reporting rate for violence in the Philippines, including for sexual violence and abuse. What was being done about that? Why were low-level cases being actively pursued within the courts? Had a national preventative mechanism against torture been established, and were there any special processes for addressing child victims? Were helplines available throughout the Philippines?\n\nHYND AYOUBI IDRISSI, Committee Vice Chair and Taskforce Member, said Filipino legislation aligned the definition of the child with the provisions of the Convention. Could the delegation inform the Committee on specific measures to ensure the law on child marriage was effectively implemented across the country? Marginalised groups faced substantial discrimination across the country. What measures were planned to combat de facto discrimination? What had been undertaken by the State party to train those working with and for children, to ensure the best interests of the child were a fundamental principle? The Committee was alarmed about the murders of children, the use of children for military purposes, and extra-judicial executions. The war on drugs had seen many children killed, or left traumatised, abandoned, or orphaned. What was being planned to prosecute all those involved in those executions? What measures had been taken to provide support and psychological assistance to orphaned children? What measures had been taken to protect the victims and child witnesses of violence, particularly in the war on drugs? The Philippines was a pioneer when it came to children’s participation, which was very positive. What was being done to ensure that children were truly involved in all matters relating to them?\n\nThe Committee hailed the Philippines for efforts in guaranteeing birth registration, particularly within populations of concern. The Committee also welcomed the Philippines’ accession in 2022 to the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness. However, there was a large proportion of children who had not been registered and were at risk of statelessness; in 2021, over 128,000 children were at risk of being stateless. What measures had been taken to continue efforts toward birth registration? What had been done to protect those children from statelessness?\n\nBENYAM DAWIT MEZMUR, Committee Expert and Taskforce Member, asked to what extent the socio-economic agenda targeted children? What were the criteria for accessing benefits and what was their impact? The number of Filipinos working overseas resulted in over 3 million children being left behind; could the delegation comment on that? Could information be provided on the regulatory framework for institutions? What efforts had been made towards de-institutionalisation? How had the Foster Care Act of 2012 been implemented? Could the delegation clarify the term “foundlings” used in the report? What was the balance between international adoption and domestic adoption?\n\nResponses by the Delegation\n\nThe delegation said the law on “foundlings” specifically defined a foundling as an abandoned child or infant with unknown parentage. By Filipino law, that was someone under the age of 18. It was a priority for the Philippines to implement measures to address the root causes of the rising number of adolescent pregnancies. The Government was undertaking several activities to address that issue, including the promotion of quality sexuality education, access to reproductive health services and protective services against violence and abuse. A registry was available which listed all persons with disabilities, including children. Children with physical disability accounted for the highest percentage of children with disabilities in the country. Benefit packages were in place for children with disabilities.\n\nThere had been an increase in the number of convictions for trafficking cases, and 600 child victims had secured justice against their traffickers. A taskforce had been created against trafficking, an offence which the Philippines was committed to addressing. There were existing mechanisms to investigate corruption in the Philippines, including the Ombudsman and an office within the President’s Office tasked with investigating corruption. An inter-agency committee had been created to investigate cases of judicial killings. Since 2019, there had been efforts made to use video interviews, to avoid re-traumatising victims. A hotline was available for people to report cases of trafficking in persons. The hotline was available 24/7 throughout the Philippines. Reports could also be made through e-mail and Facebook.\n\nThe delegation said that no bill or law had ever been approved to lower the age of criminal responsibility in the Philippines. The funding of rehabilitation facilities went through strict processes for qualifying the beneficiaries.\n\nThe Philippines was implementing conditional cash transfers, benefitting over 2 million children. The programme included family development sessions, which discussed the prevention of child abuse, as well as youth development sessions. The de-institutionalisation of each child was planned when he or she entered an institution, to ensure their families would be prepared for their reintegration into society. Through family development sessions, the Government partnered with the local civil register for the registration of children, particularly for children living in indigenous communities. Any abandoned children would be cared for by the State; being placed in institutions was a last resort and a family environment was always preferred. There were case workers appointed to oversee the needs of every child who was abandoned.\n\nThe Philippines law enforcement agency fostered collaboration with other international agencies when it came to the prosecution of online abuse of children. This had resulted in 71 convictions and the rescue of 666 minor victims, from 2016 to present. Out of the 71 convictions, 10 were foreign nationals. Video evidence was used to prevent the re-traumatisation of the child victim.\n\nWhen it came to incarcerated mothers, a policy was in place which ensured that children were not separated from their mothers before they were six months old. The infant and the mother would also be given protection within the facility. Before a child was separated from his or her mother, it was ensured that they were given sufficient time to bond. From 2016–2019, the Child Rights Center of the Commission on Human Rights had conducted a series of research studies and youth home visits. It received complaints and queries and released press statements on child rights issues and reports. Since July 2019, four bills had been filed and were pending in Congress. The draft Charter of the Commission on Human Rights had undergone consultation with stakeholders, and its passage would be advocated for in Congress. Students were allowed to attend schools wearing clothes which expressed their gender identity.\n\nQuestions by Committee Experts\n\nCLARENCE NELSON, Committee Expert and Taskforce Coordinator for the Philippines, asked about the helplines; were these used for reports of sexual abuse or domestic violence against children? Were they staffed by professionally competent people?\n\nHYND AYOUBI IDRISSI, Committee Vice Chair and Taskforce Member, said lesbian, bisexual, gay, transgender, and intersex children faced discrimination in schools on a daily basis. What measures were in place to allow them to report that in a confidential manner without fear of reprisals from other children?\n\nCLARENCE NELSON, Committee Expert and Taskforce Coordinator for the Philippines, asked if there had been a mid-term review of the national strategic plan for children with disabilities? How was disability defined? Were families with children with disabilities supported by the State? Were there specialised paediatricians for children with disabilities? Reports had been received regarding cases of sexual violence against deaf girls and those who were visually impaired, which were not properly investigated due to the absence of sign language interpreters. What was the State’s position regarding sign language interpreters generally? What happened when these individuals went to the police about such instances?\n\nBENYAM DAWIT MEZMUR, Committee Expert and Taskforce Member, asked about progress made on child mortality since 2016; what interventions had helped to reduce numbers? The State should be congratulated on the “Mandatory Children and Infants Immunization Act.” What was the impact of that act? What were some of the challenges faced in reaching every child? The reproductive health of adolescents was one of the issues which needed to be highlighted. What was the status of the State party regarding safe abortion? What had the State party done as a measure to address the challenges identified in regard to HIV/AIDS? Was there discussion in the State party around developing a comprehensive child mental health policy?\n\nANN MARIE SKELTON, Committee Expert and Taskforce Member, said education was an area where the Philippines had done a commendable amount of work, however there was still a dropout rate which needed to be lowered. What was being done to close those gaps? What was being done to include marginalised children such as those in street situations? What was being done to address the lack of educational resources in rural areas? Why was there a problem in those areas? Could more information be provided about the supplementary feeding programme to increase enrolment in early childhood education? What else was been done to increase enrolment, particularly in rural areas? What ideas had been developed to create more spaces to play for children?\n\nHow did the Philippines deal with asylum seeking, refugee and migrant children? How were these children received and cared for? How was age uncertainty of these children dealt with? The Committee noted that certain types of child labour were banned. What measures were taken to reintegrate children back into school, or what was done if they had never been in school? What was being done to communicate to children and families that the short-term gains of child labour did not pan out in the long term? Was the work of labour inspectors effective in the informal sector? The figures on children in street situations were confusing. What was the true situation of street children in the country?\n\nThe Philippines was to be commended for adopting several anti-trafficking acts, however it remained prevalent. Was a new strategic action plan being developed? What had been learnt from the previous period? There were areas where the sale of children was occurring to pay off debts; what was being done about that? Ms. Skelton commended the Philippines for adopting measures for the special protection of children in armed conflict, however children were still at risk. Was the State considering joining the Third Optional Protocol?\n\nResponses by the Delegation\n\nThe delegation said that a law had been drafted to minimise online sexual abuse and exploitation. The Government was optimistic that would make a difference; the enactment of the law cast a wider net, enabling more perpetrators to be brought to justice. Under the amended law on trafficking, there were support services for victims and their families. The law mandating stronger convictions against rape and sexual abuse had also raised the age of sexual consent to 16 years of age. The Philippine Commission on Children would operationally replace the Council for the Welfare of Children and would be attached to the Office to the President, serving as the primary convener for all bodies working on children’s rights. The passing of the “Magna Carta” on children would create the Commission. The Philippines published budget documents regularly and was strengthening children’s participation in Governmental processes through a series of consultations. The Council for the Welfare of Children was developing a statistical and monitoring framework which would serve as a database for children and would establish a 24-hour hotline to address children’s concerns.\n\nDespite the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government had developed training manuals to support services related to HIV, child protection, mental health, and other issues. The Philippines was creating a plan of action to end violence against children. The Council for the Welfare of Children in 2020 began conducting coaching and mentoring with local Government units on the plan to end violence against children. A gender-responsive policy was issued in 2017 to protect children from all forms of discrimination. The policy covered indigenous children, lesbian, gay, transgender children, and those in conflict with the law. Children’s participation was being honoured in the Philippines, and a 2021 guidebook on that topic had been created. There was a child representative on the Council for the Welfare of Children and on regional and subcommittees for the Council.\n\nThere were more than 60 hotlines operating in the Philippines to protect women and children against violence. All staff were specially trained to work with cases featuring violence, abuse, and exploitation. A national strategic plan for children with disabilities aimed to enable an environment where those children could fully enjoy their rights and reach their full potential. There had been no mid-term reviews conducted as such, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a review would be conducted one year prior to the plan’s culmination. There was a downward trend of child labour in the Philippines, with the number of children participating in child labour halved from 2007 to 2020. The Government took strategic measures to eliminate child labour, including through providing livelihood assistance to parents of children who were participating in child labour.\n\nThe number 4,000 was not the total number of children in street situations; it was the total number of street children served by the Philippines Department of Social Welfare and Development Programme. In 2022, there were more than 246,000 street children in the country. Efforts were being made to manage those numbers and rescue the children and integrate them back into society. Under the revised penal code in the Philippines, abortion was prohibited and penalised. However, jurisprudence dating from 1961 stated that in the case of a medical necessity, abortion could be performed.\n\nThe delegation said that a process was in place to ensure that learners with disabilities were identified, and to facilitate their inclusion in the education system. Various programmes were in place to discourage students from dropping out of school. The alternative learning system and alternative delivery modes were flexible learning options which were helpful for learners at risk of dropping out, and those with special needs. When the Philippines ratified the Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict, it made a commitment that the minimum age of recruitment to the armed forces was 18 years.\n\nThe delegation said the Government did not “red-tag” anyone (meaning to mark individuals with accusations) particularly children who had been recruited, and who were innocent victims. Parents had learned that children in certain schools were being forced to use weapons and that their children’s academic records were unavailable. The institutions were not schools for children, but training for combatants. The Government had no choice but to close those schools, in line with its commitments under the Optional Protocol. Until such time that the third Optional Protocol on a communications procedure was shielded from abuse, the Philippines was not inclined to ratify it.\n\nA 24/7 hotline had been established to address cases of violence against women and children, and social media accounts had been set up to receive complaints. The Philippines had established a centre targeting online exploitation of children; it was able to obtain information from other countries and Interpol, as well as through local sources. It was the first centre in Southeast Asia where local and international authorities gathered to aid such investigations. Many federal law enforcement officials including from the Netherlands and Australia were able to refer cases to the centre. In 2020, a review had been conducted of the law criminalising violence against women and children. The data showed a downward trend in terms of abuse, and it could be assumed that it was due to improved services and service providers. The State would conduct a full assessment of that law and would review the efforts of duty bearers at all levels, with findings to be drawn up to enhance the law. A law on safe spaces mandated that all schools needed to create a committee tasked with receiving cases of harassment in a way which ensured the protection of the plaintiff.\n\nTampering with the civil registry was punishable by imprisonment of up to 12 years. According to legislation, compared to sexual assault, rape was severely penalised as it might lead to unwanted procreation. Efforts continued toward comprehensive birth registration for children who in the context of displacement due to armed conflict were unregistered. There were rules for determining the status of refugees and stateless persons. The Philippines institutionalised protection services for stateless persons, asylum seekers and refugees, to ensure they had access to social services.\n\nThe sale of children was already penalised under the anti-trafficking in persons law. Child marriage was also punishable under the State’s new law which prohibited that practice. The Philippines had aided six countries in their prosecution of child pornography cases. There had been instances where a perpetrator was prosecuted in the country where they were located, and the Philippines authorities assisted by providing evidence. The definition in the Philippines of children with disabilities was based on United Nations conventions, and covered those who had long-term physical and sensory impairments.\n\nInfant and child health outcomes showed improvements over the past two decades. The infant mortality rate showed a slow decline, and the Philippines was striving to reach its target rate of just 12 deaths per 1000 live births by 2030. The Philippines was on track to reach its target for anaemia reduction, and the prevalence of Vitamin A deficiency among children had been dramatically reduced between 2015-2019. The government had implemented “catch-up immunisation campaigns” and introduced “Vaccination Wednesdays” to encourage an uptick in immunisation rates. A vaccination playbook was issued to local government, to strengthen immunisation programmes across all localities. The Government was prioritising amending the vaccination law, giving it a penal provision to make vaccination mandatory. The Philippines had achieved its target of vaccinating 70 per cent of the 12 to 17-year-old age group against COVID-19.\n\nThe implementation of a supplementary feeding programme consisted of hot meals being served during children’s snack-time, over a period of 120 days. More than 600,000 indigenous households benefitted from funding provided by the Government.\n\nQuestions by Committee Experts\n\nCLARENCE NELSON, Committee Expert and Taskforce Coordinator for the Philippines, noted that four out of five Filipino children grew up exposed to violence; that was very concerning. When did the State intend to finalise the plan against violence against children and roll it out nationally?\n\nANN MARIE SKELTON, Committee Expert and Taskforce Member, noted that schools had been closed for two years during the COVID-19 pandemic, which was one of the longest closures in the world. What had been learned from that, and would things be done differently next time? “Rescuing” street children was not necessarily the right approach; the Committee’s general comment 21 on children in street situations provided guidance in that regard. The risk of reprisals and confidentiality rules could not be a barrier to finding out what was happening to children in detention; protocols needed to be created around visits to such children. Children must not be criminalised, yet United Nations verified information stated that 24 children were still being detained in 2021 for their association with armed groups. Was there any improvement that could be made in that difficult area of work?\n\nA Committee Expert asked what activities were being undertaken against measles? Was there a mechanism for early detection of children with disabilities?\n\nA Committee Expert asked about corporal punishment; it was positive that a law would be adopted on that issue. When would the law be enacted? What was the State’s vision when it came to children with disabilities? Were all its plans compatible with a human-rights based vision for children with disabilities? Were mechanisms in place to evaluate the effectiveness of the plans?\n\nHYND AYOUBI IDRISSI, Committee Vice Chair and Taskforce Member, asked for more information about children of Indonesian descent and Japanese descent.\n\nA Committee Expert asked about the number of children deprived of liberty, the length of their detention and the reasons for their detention? Had the national preventative mechanism visited the places where children were deprived of liberty? Which plans were there to improve their conditions of detention? What were the complaint mechanisms in place for children in detention? Did each child entering the justice system have access to a lawyer?\n\nBENYAM DAWIT MEZMUR, Committee Expert and Taskforce Member, said Philippines featured on the global hunger index; how were children targeted by services to address chronic food insecurity? Could more information be provided on child participation when it came to addressing climate change? Could more details be provided on alternative solutions to addressing drug addiction and dependency?\n\nA Committee Expert asked about the issue of delays in court proceedings; could updated information be provided on that, and on legal aid? What were the opportunities for children living on small islands to participate at the national level?\n\nResponses by the Delegation\n\nThe delegation said that many persons of Japanese descent were not able to acquire Japanese citizenship. The Government had established a national justice management system which captured case data from children as soon as they came into contact with the justice system. Any form of deprivation of liberty for children should be done as a measure of last resort.\n\nThere were a lot of things which needed to be done to respond to the needs of children with disabilities. In 2021, the State, in partnership with the United Nations Children’s Fund, had initiated a study which looked at the extra costs of raising children with disabilities in the Philippines. A series of consultations were underway with organizations of persons with disabilities. Children with disabilities were only referred to institutions if it was in their best interest.\n\nCurrently, there were nearly 1,700 paediatricians in the Philippines. Physical therapists were responsible for screening children early on and referring them to specialists. There were more than 74,000 children on the registry of persons with disabilities. Screening had been expanded from six to 28 disorders. Around 8 per cent of newborns were screened as of 2021, which assisted in early detection of children with disabilities. Tuberculosis remained prevalent in the Philippines, and children and the elderly were disproportionally affected. To address that, the Government included tuberculosis protocols in its guidelines for primary care providers.\n\nClosing statements\n\nCLARENCE NELSON, Committee Expert and Taskforce Coordinator for the Philippines, thanked the delegation for the frank exchange of information and ideas. The Committee was happy that the State was making progress in its legislation and hoped that would continue. Mr. Nelson wished the delegation safe travels back to the Philippines.\n\nANGELO M. TAPALES, Executive Director, Council for the Welfare of Children and head of the delegation, said the Government was committed to upholding its treaty obligations, particularly regarding the Convention. The Philippines had come a long way regarding children’s rights protection, but knew that more could be done. The observations of the Committee regarding the issues facing the children in the country would all be taken to heart, and the Government would take all necessary steps to address those concerns.\n\nMIKIKO OTANI, Committee Chairperson, thanked the delegation for the dialogue and extended the best wishes of the Committee to the children of the Philippines.\n\nLink: https://www.ungeneva.org/en/news-media/meeting-summary/2022/09/hailing-philippines-pioneer-childrens-participation-experts\n\n___________\n\nProduced by the United Nations Information Service in Geneva for use of the information media;\n\nnot an official record.

    "U.S., Philippines Conclude Training on Countering Threat Networks": "Manila, September 26, 2022—On September 23, the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) concluded a two-year series of exchanges to enhance the capacity of Filipino military, police, and maritime personnel to identify, analyze, and counter criminal and terrorist networks that threaten peace and security in the Philippines.\n\nOver the course of six analytic workshops and subject matter expert exchanges, the Counter Threat Network (CTN) operational exchange and capacity building program gathered intelligence personnel from the Armed Forces Philippines (AFP), the Philippine National Police (PNP), and the National Coast Watch Center (NCWC) to exchange knowledge and best practices on understanding and engaging networks of violent extremist organizations, insurgent groups, and criminal entities. Participants also gained information on threat network analysis, threat visualization, critical capabilities analysis, and producing actionable intelligence reports.\n\nThese efforts are part of a broader security cooperation agreement established to enhance the integration of intelligence and operations against threat networks in a multidomain environment.\n\n“Part of the CTN series that was most significant is the collaboration and operational exchange of the AFP, PNP and NCWC personnel. With this activity, participants were able to establish networks and exchange knowledge and skills in achieving a common goal,” stated NCWC Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Jeffrey Abasolo.\n\n“We are proud of the participants’ accomplishments in gaining a diverse set of analytic and critical thinking approaches to counter these complex networks,” DTRA Partner Engagement Division Educational Strategies Lead Mila Nieves said. “They are well prepared to pass these skills on to their counterparts.”\n\nAccording to DTRA Partner Engagement Division Chief Steve Greene, this latest exchange represents another example of the partnership between the U.S. Department of Defense and its counterparts in the Philippines. “After six different workshops and over one hundred student interactions, we can say that we have shared a mutually beneficial learning experience where both countries have gained from the interaction and improved their ability to operate together to prevent and reduce threats. We look forward to continued opportunities for collaboration.”\n\n###\n\nAbout the Defense Threat Reduction Agency\n\nDTRA enables the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. government, and international partners to counter and deter weapons of mass destruction and emerging threats.\n\nAbout the National Coast Watch Center\n\nNCWS was established in September 2011 pursuant to Executive Order No. 57 series of 2011 as a central interagency mechanism for a coordinated and coherent approach on maritime issues and maritime security operations towards enhancing governance in the country’s maritime domain.",

    "A Deep-Dive Into The 2022 Fleet Of Philippine Airlines": "With just 75 aircraft, the fleet of Philippine Airlines connects the Philippines to the Middle East, North America, and the Asia Pacific Region.\n\nThe flag carrier of the Philippines, Philippine Airlines, has an important role in connecting people to its country while also providing important air services between the various islands of the Philippine Archipelago. Today, we examine its fleet of 75 aircraft, where they're flying, and how this fleet is much smaller than it used to be.\n\nThe Philippine Airlines fleet at a glance\n\nA quick overview of the Philippine Airlines fleet shows us the following types and quantities:\n\n11x De Havilland Canada DHC-8-400\n\n13x Airbus A320-200\n\n22x Airbus A321-200\n\n8x Airbus A321neo\n\n9x Airbus A330-300\n\n2x Airbus A350-900\n\n11x Boeing 777-300ER\n\nThese figures also include aircraft operating under the carrier's regional subsidiary, PAL Express. This division is responsible for operating some of the carrier's Airbus A320s and A321s, as well as all the DHC Dash 8s.\n\nAdditionally, anyone who is familiar with the historical operations of the airline will see that the carrier's larger jets are absent. The carrier once flew big jets like the Airbus A340-300 and Boeing 747-400. Unfortunately, for big jet-lovers, the airline retired the former in 2018 and the latter in 2014.\n\nThe airline's fleet size over time. Photo: AeroTransport Data Bank (ATDB.aero)\n\nGet the latest aviation news straight to your inbox: Sign up for our newsletters today.\n\nIsland-hopping turboprops\n\nWhen it comes to the 11 De Havilland Canada Dash 8-400s, these PAL Express-operated turboprops connect smaller airports with bigger destinations like Manila and Cebu. With an average age of six years, these birds aren't too old. And if we dig deeper, we can see that a single Dash 8-400 is severely impacting the fleet's average age, as the aircraft registered RP-C3036 is about twenty-two and a half years old. This aircraft is currently parked, while the other 10 jets are listed as operational. The youngest of these turboprops are a little less than three years of age.\n\nWith the exception of RP-C3036, which has 76 seats, all other Dash 8-400s are fitted with a single class layout of 86 economy seats.\n\nThe airline's Dash 8 fleet is mostly used for island hopping across the Philippines archipelago. Photo: John Andrei Policarpio via Wikimedia Commons\n\nShort and medium-range narrowbody jets\n\nFor slightly higher-capacity operations and services that require more range than the Dash 8s are capable of, Philippine Airlines relies on its A320 and A321 narrowbodies.\n\nThe A320 fleet is mainly operated by PAL Express, which means these jets fly mainly domestic services within the Philippines. Meanwhile, the longer fuselage and longer-range A321s operate a mix of domestic and international routes.\n\nWhen it comes to international service, the A321s serve cities in the region such as:\n\nBangkok\n\nGuam\n\nKuala Lumpur\n\nPhnom Penh\n\nSingapore\n\nAirbus narrowbodies comprise the majority of the airline's fleet. Photo: Steven Agre via Wikimedia Commons\n\nHowever, both the A321-200s and A321neos are also tasked with some longer-range services, including flights to:\n\nBrisbane\n\nBusan\n\nHong Kong\n\nNagoya\n\nOsaka\n\nPort Moresby\n\nSeoul\n\nTokyo (Haneda and Narita)\n\nWhen it comes to age, the A320-200s are the oldest, with an average of 13 years. The A321-200s are a bit younger, with an average of about eight years. Meanwhile, the next-generation A321neos average just under four years of age.\n\nThe A321neo is the newest type in the Philippine Airlines fleet. Photo: Airbus\n\nThe Airbus A330-300\n\nNaturally, Philippine Airlines' collection of widebody aircraft serves the airline's longest routes. According to current FlightRadar24.com data, the carrier's destinations in the Middle East (Dammam, Doha, Dubai, and Riyadh) are served by some of its nine Airbus A330-300s. This fleet has an average age of just over eight and a half years and is configured with three classes - business, premium economy, and economy.\n\nThe Airbus A330 is also deployed on a series of rather interesting transpacific services. The first is the airline's Manila to Los Angeles service via Honolulu, which currently has flight numbers PR100/101 and PR113. The second is a Manila to Los Angeles service via Seoul, which operates as PR112. Digging a little deeper, it looks like PR112/113 sees an A330 fly from Manila to Seoul, then from Seoul to Los Angeles, then from Los Angeles to Manila via Honolulu. It's quite an interesting mix of stopovers, with Los Angeles to Seoul being offered as its own bookable fifth-freedom service.\n\nA shrunken A350 fleet?\n\nConfigured with 30 seats in business, 24 in premium economy, and 241 seats in economy, the A350-900s flying for Philippine Airlines are noticeably more premium-heavy than the A330s. This makes sense, considering the fact that the type is the carrier's newest and most modern widebody aircraft. While the airline now has just two A350s, this wasn't always the case.\n\nIndeed, anyone who has followed the Philippine Airlines fleet over the years will notice that the carrier once had six Airbus A350-900s. Considering the fact that this is a new and efficient type, a reduction in this particular fleet is more on the rare side - with LATAM and South African Airways being two other examples of carriers that have given up their A350s.\n\nIn the case of Philippine Airlines, the reduction of the A350 fleet by four jets was carried out due to the airline making its way through the bankruptcy process. This was done in the hopes of simplifying its operations and lowering expenditures. The four jets went to German airline Lufthansa, with that airline now operating 21 A350-900s.\n\nIn 2021, we reported that the airline also had plans to reduce its Boeing 777 fleet. Interestingly, however, it appears that the airline held on to these widebodies, with all 10 still listed as part of the carrier's fleet. At the same time, three of the 10 777s are currently listed as parked.\n\nDespite the smaller fleet, it looks like the decision to restructure and give up the A350s has paid off. Indeed, the past August saw Philippine Airlines post what it called \"record profits.\" The airline declared $1.1 billion in revenues for the first six months of 2022, which it says is a 258% improvement from the same period in 2021.\n\nThe Airbus A350-900 is the airline's flagship widebody. Photo: Airbus\n\nThe Boeing 777-300ER\n\nConfigured with just two classes, the Boeing 777-300ERs flying for Philippine Airlines have 42 seats in business class and 328 in the economy cabin. These high-capacity widebodies average just over eight and a half years and fly some of the airline's longest routes along with the A350s. Services include:\n\nNew York\n\nSan Francisco\n\nToronto\n\nand Vancouver\n\nInterestingly, in 2019, the airline was in discussions with Boeing to acquire two new Boeing 777X aircraft. The US planemaker was reported to be pushing the 777X as a replacement for two of the carrier's older 777-300ER aircraft. Since we reported on that plan in 2019, nothing has really developed further. The most likely reason for this lack of change are the events of 2020 and the negative financial impact it had on the carrier. The airline's oldest 777s are about 13 years old. While they are nowhere near factory fresh, the two jets at this age could probably operate reliably for at least a few more years - especially if well-maintained. This will work well for the carrier, as Boeing is still a few more years away from the 777X entering commercial passenger service. But do you think Philippine Airlines should eventually update its 777-300ER fleet to the 777-9? Or should it modernize with Airbus A350s instead?\n\nThe airline has 10 Boeing 777s which average just over eight and a half years.

While easing border restrictions and pent-up travel demand have helped greatly, the airline would face a new headwind due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nOn April 1st of this year, Philippine Airlines announced that it would be taking the precautionary measure of avoiding Russian airspace due to concerns related to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. The result of this circumvention of airspace results in a one-hour refueling stop and an overall longer routing and travel time over the Pacific. The jets departing New York JFK and Toronto Pearson both stopover at Vancouver International Airport to \"top up\" before the long flight across the Pacific. The carrier used to fly a fifth freedom service between Vancouver and New York, but this was discontinued in 2018.\n\nFlying east out of Manila, the carrier's PR126 and PR118 services continue to operate nonstop, from Manila to New York JFK, and nonstop from Manila to Toronto respectively. Due to prevailing winds, flights in this direction don't need to make a refueling stop in order to avoid Russian airspace. Philippines media outlet Journal News notes that the airline \"seeks the understanding of passengers for this necessary step, as safety and operational integrity remain the cornerstone of PAL operations.\" The airline says that it will revert to nonstop JFK-MNL and Toronto-MNL services as soon as operational issues are resolved.\n\nThe airline's Manila to JFK service ranks as the 8th longest route in the world this October, with a distance of 8,520 miles (13,712 km) and a block time of 16 hours and 15 minutes.\n\nFlying westward, aircraft departing Toronto and New York must refuel in Vancouver to avoid Russian airspace. Photo: GCMap.com\n\nSo there is your deep dive into the fleet of Philippine Airlines. The carrier's current list of long-haul, transcontinental destinations is much smaller than other flag carriers, but its very clear that the airline shines when it comes to domestic and regional connectivity, using its fleets of Dash 8 turboprops and A320 family aircraft.\n\nHave you flown with Philippine Airlines before?

    "The Philippines and Israel: a history of agricultural exchange and cooperation": "The Philippines and Israel have a long history of friendship. During the Second World War, the Philippine government offered refuge to approximately 1,300 Jewish refugees fleeing the Nazi persecution of Jews in Europe. It was further deepened in 1947 when the Philippines supported the establishment of the State of Israel, being the only country in Asia to do so. These are the main historical pillars of Israel-Philippine relations, which paved the way for more partnerships between the two countries.\n\nL-R TAU President Dr. Max. P. Guillermo, Mayor Erlon C. Agustin of the Municipality of Camiling, and Ambassador Ilan Fluss. (Embassy of Israel in the Philippines)\n\nThe government of Israel has been working with the Philippines in several capacities including agriculture under the Center for International Development Cooperation (MASHAV), through the Center for International Agricultural Development Cooperation (CINADCO), and the Philippine- Israel Center for Agricultural Training (PICAT).\n\nFormer projects include working with the Bureau of Plant Industry (BPI) to introduce Israeli technology focusing on the microproduction of avocados, vegetables, and high value crops and later a program of collaborating was established with select state universities on training and upgrading the extension services to farmers.\n\n“What we are trying to do now is to create a partnership with the Department of Agriculture looking at the first stage in the areas of training and extension services through some of the centers of the Agriculture Training Institute (ATI),” Israeli Ambassador to the Philippines, His Excellency (H.E.) Ilan Fluss said.\n\nThe Embassy is in the process of planning and discussing how it can meet the needs of its Filipino partners in a more meaningful way, including conducting training and consultation, distributing Israeli agricultural technology, and sending both young farmers and industry experts to Israel for intensive and short training programs respectively.\n\n“We are trying to… support in areas that we believe we have expertise [in] and we can contribute [to],” he added. “Obviously, things have to be adjusted to the climatic conditions here… but… for me, the most important element to the partnership is approaching agriculture in a different way.”\n\nAside from introducing Israeli agriculture techniques and technology, the Embassy also aims to prove to Filipino farmers that working in agriculture can be profitable, even lucrative.\n\n“Agriculture, quite often, is seen here, especially by the smallholder farmers, as subsistence farming. Now, in Israel, subsistence farming would not exist. It’s a market economy, and the farmer has to make money. How do you make money? By improving your output and minimizing your input. Less expenses, maximum income,” H.E. Fluss said. “…what I’m trying to do is to share this approach, to share some of the best practices, and to share those technologies.”\n\nAn Israeli consultant giving advice on hydroponics. (Embassy of Israel in the Philippines)\n\nOngoing MASHAV programs\n\nThe Israeli embassy, through its many linkages in government and private sectors in the Philippines, have several programs currently ongoing under MASHAV.\n\nOne of its most popular ones is the Israeli Agricultural internship program, conducted in cooperation with the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) with support and oversight from the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Agriculture, which focuses on capacity building and the promotion of food security.\n\nAbout 500 young farmers or fresh agriculture graduates are sent to Israel annually. The paid internship lasts 11 months and includes both classroom and fieldwork. Participants are given the chance to experience how an Israeli farm works, from cultivation to marketing to pivoting according to changing times. “…the idea is… after they come back… to the Philippines… they change their mindset because they have been working with Israeli farmers, [which means] understanding that agriculture is sophisticated [and] has… to create an income.”\n\nThe agencies involved are currently trying to strengthen the reintegration of Israeli agriculture scholars in the country, which can be challenging as a number of students either use their training to get agriculture jobs overseas, or end up not working in the sector altogether. “…we would like to make sure that this program is contributing to the challenge here in the Philippines,” H.E. Fluss said.\n\nThe Embassy is also working with several state universities, including the Agricultural University of Tarlac, which is being provided with greenhouses, hydroponics setups, and training. “…the idea is really to do something localized and to help local farmers learn this approach.”\n\nAnother academic partner is Central Luzon State University (CLSU), who is working with MASHAV on an open field drip irrigation project. CLSU is also home to the Shalom Club, a global organization that all MASHAV scholars automatically belong to.\n\nH.E. Flusss at the1Bataan Agri Inno-Tech Center. (Embassy of Israel to the Philippines)\n\nPublic private partnerships\n\nThe Embassy values its linkages through both government and private sectors. “I work for (the) government, but at (the) end of the day… if you want something that will continue long term, I believe we have to put a lot of effort into the private sector, which is there to make money,” H.E. Fluss said. “…since we’re talking about the markets [and] the economy, we have to… work with the local private sector or with government or with cooperatives, but… working in an economic way for profit. And for that reason, I believe that PPP is very important because at the end of the day, you work together.”\n\nHe cited the 1Bataan Agri Inno-Tech Center (1Bataan AITC), a public private partnership between the province of Bataan and an Israeli agriculture company. The company is currently working with smallholder rice farmers using Israeli technology such as water pumps and drip irrigation to help them make more money by planting vegetables during the dry season, when rice cannot be cultivated.\n\n“We come from the Middle East. We have challenges of being in a drought-prone area… But with climate change and global warming, it’s becoming a global issue, so [it] makes sense in general to move to drip irrigation, but you have to make [relevant] calculations,” he said. “…The dry season is a long season, and in six months, you can get so many vegetables out of your land… So they’re working with the farmers exactly doing that.”\n\nThe partnership includes helping farmers surmount challenges such as finding direct markets for their harvests. “…it’s a whole concept changing in a way. How do… these smallholder farmers practice agriculture while not reducing and not affecting the production of rice, which is very important to the country, [while] …adding …high value crops which will bring an income to the farmer.”\n\nThe Ambassador recounted his recent visit to the 1Bataan AITC site: “I met some of the farmer who are into this project and it was amazing to see how proud they were because they’re doing something new, something different, and they’re also able to make some money. So for me, it is by showing to the public that they can do it differently.”\n\nHelping boost food security\n\nIsrael is known worldwide as a hub for innovation, including in the field of agriculture. It is in this regard that the Ambassador has been personally requested by the President of the Philippines to help the country’s agriculture sector.\n\n“Food security is a very important socioeconomic issue, so I’m very happy that we talked about it. We’re now working with the Department of Agriculture to identify where we should come in and what exactly to introduce,” H.E. Fluss shared.\n\n“At the same time, I’m also working with the private sector… What we’re trying to do is to [facilitate] introductions between Israeli private sector and the Philippine private sector and I can tell you that this is going very well.”\n\nThe Ambassador offered two examples of how Israeli technology has, or can be adapted to the Philippine culture and climate.\n\nFirst was a cacao project undertaken with a private company looking to expand the production of the traditional Criollo variety. “We don’t grow cacao in Israel, but we have expertise in the approach in some of the practices and when we enter into projects, we use experts from the agriculture sector but there are many elements to it,” the Ambassador explained.\n\nThe Filipino partner was introduced to an Israeli company that worked as a consultant, “introducing practices.., I would say the Israeli way, from checking the soil… to irrigation, [grafting procedures, and pest control].…”\n\nThe trees aren’t production ready yet, but according to the Filipino partner, “it looks very promising.”\n\nIsrael is also excited to be introducing their dairy technology to the Philippines. Israeli cows are the top milk producers in the world, with each cow producing an average of 30 liters a day, a far cry from the Philippines’ average of 9-11 liters a day. “We have dairy farms in the desert in Israel, so it’s about managing the climate, managing the cow.., the feed, and everything else, so I believe that if we introduce dairy farming, including technologies and the management system, then we’ll see a lot of milk and cheese which will be produced locally here in the Philippines.”\n\nSuch technologies, if properly applied, have the potential to positively impact the local dairy industry, which currently produces only 1% of the country’s needs.\n\nThe Embassy of Israel in the Philippines is looking forward to sharing Israeli dairy technology. (Embassy of Israel in the Philippines)\n\nChanging minds, changing lives\n\nMore important than the exposure to new technology is the hope for a change in mindset. The easiest way to encourage this is through proof of concept. “I believe that when you have successful agriculture, it will change mindsets,” H.E. Fluss said. “When farmers will start making money… they will upgrade their standard of living. They will be able to afford better living (conditions), better food, and they will be able to send their kids to be educated.”\n\nThe Ambassador emphasizes the need to tailor both technology and mindset to local climate and customs, as well as make the most of linkages between both public and private organizations. “…As a person who is working in creating bridges between Israel and the Philippines… It’s very important for me to always emphasize that I’m introducing Israeli practices. I’m introducing Israeli technologies and Israeli mindset. Now, the challenge is… what you take out of it and what can be implemented in the Philippines. And for this, I must work in a partnership… so I need a very good strong local partner who will guide me… and this is why development is a big challenge.”\n\nWhat H.E. Fluss hopes to achieve cooperation and progress. “My vision is to see bridges of innovation and technology between Israel and the Philippines… including in agriculture… [To bring] Israeli innovation… Israeli technologies… the Israeli mindset, and then… adjusting to local… needs… and implementing it in the Philippines. And I would like to say that… by the end of my term and beyond, you’ll be able to see that the farmers are… making money [and are]… using this income for the benefit of their standard of living [and] for the education of their children… This is what I would really like to see.”\n\nRead more about farming and gardening at agriculture.com.ph",

    "Philippines, world leaders urged to ramp up climate action after 'Karding' onslaught": "Philippines, world leaders urged to ramp up climate action after 'Karding' onslaught\n\nA resident carries belongings while evacuating from his submerged home in the aftermath of Super Typhoon Noru in San Ildefonso, Bulacan province on September 26, 2022.\n\nMANILA, Philippines — The onslaught of Super Typhoon Karding (Noru) is a reminder that the Philippine government and the world leaders need to act fast to fight climate change and mitigate its impacts, groups said Monday.\n\nKarding, the strongest tropical cyclone to hit the country this year, ravaged the agricultural region of Central Luzon as it toppled trees and power lines and flooded low-lying communities.\n\nRelated Stories PAGASA modernization brings hope for better weather forecasting\n\nThe Philippines, one of the most vulnerable countries to the impacts of climate change, is affected by an average of 20 cyclones a year. Scientists warn that storms are becoming more intense as the planet continues to heat up because of human-induced climate change.\n\n“Super Typhoon Karding is another grim reminder that the climate crisis is here and now, and that national and world leaders need to step up in terms of proactive action to mitigate and prepare for its impacts,” said Jon Bonifacio, national coordinator of Kalikasan People’s Network for the Environment.\n\nHe also stressed the need to rehabilitate and conserve natural barriers such as the Sierra Madre mountain range. Sierra Madre, the longest mountain range in the Philippines and the site of nearly half of the country’s surviving old-growth forest, historically serves as a buffer against storms that develop in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nSierra Madre remains under heavy threat of illegal logging, mining activities, and development projects.\n\n“In this light, destructive projects such as the Kaliwa-Kanan Dam and attacks on conservation areas like Masungi Georeserve are direct threats to the lives of millions of Filipinos, and the Marcos administration, if it is sincere in its promise of climate action, should put a stop to this,” Bonifacio said.\n\nClimate emergency, loss and damage\n\nAksyon Klima Pilipinas, a civil society network for climate action, called on the national and local governments to declare a climate emergency, and mobilize more resources and support to scale up adaptation and mitigation programs nationwide.\n\nThe climate emergency declaration, according to the group, should reduce the country’s reliance on planet-warming fossil fuels, uphold climate justice, and ramp up actions to avoid and minimize loss and damage.\n\nLoss and damage refers to the costs that nations are already facing because of a warming world. According to the Department of Finance, climate-related hazards have caused P506.1 billion in losses and damage to the country from 2010 to 2020.\n\nAKP stressed that loss and damage should be part of the agenda in COP27 climate talks in Egypt this November. Developed nations blocked the establishment of a funding facility that will help vulnerable countries like the Philippines and instead opted to initiate a dialogue on the topic in future talks.\n\n“With every super typhoon or another extreme weather event striking the nation comes more loss and damage, some of which can never be recovered, and the cries of the earth and the poor that grow louder and louder,” it said.\n\nRE-powered future\n\nThe Power for People Coalition reiterated its call for the Philippines to be fully powered by renewable energy as the country reels from the impacts of Karding.\n\n“We know the climate emergency is happening because the world continues to use fossil fuels like coal and natural gas, despite warnings aired for decades that it would lead the world to disaster,” said Gerry Arances, convenor of P4P.\n\n“Yet despite our country being a punching bag for supertyphoons, successive governments, including the current Marcos administration, continue to expand the use of fossil fuels for our country. How many more supertyphoons must hit us before our government wakes up to facts? It’s time to act, and act quickly,” he added.\n\nThe Philippines generates 76.1% of its power from coal and natural gas. While the Marcos administration has made a shift to RE sources a priority, his government is pushing for the development of natural gas — or fossil gas — that groups said may hamper a genuine transition to clean energy.\n\nGreenpeace Philippine Lea Guerrero also said the Philippines should lead the call to hold the world’s biggest climate polluting business accountable and prioritize long-term, coherent plans for climate action.\n\n“If the climate crisis is our new normal, it's time to ask ourselves if this is something we want to merely accept and endure year in and year out—or if we want to call for accountability from those most responsible for carbon emissions, particularly fossil fuel companies,” she said.",

    "Jailing of former senator raises fears over corrosion of democracy in the Philippines": "Jailing of former senator raises fears over corrosion of democracy in the Philippines\n\nThe case of a jailed former senator who had spoken out against then-President Rodrigo Duterte highlights concerns about democracy in the Philippines.\n\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\n\nAs we look at the state of democracy around the world, let's turn to the Philippines. A human rights defender there has been jailed for years, raising fears that the country's democratic guardrails have corroded. Supporters of the jailed former senator say she was framed in retaliation for exposing unlawful killings during the war on drugs initiative of then-President Rodrigo Duterte. NPR's Julie McCarthy reports.\n\nJULIE MCCARTHY, BYLINE: Leila de Lima, the country's justice secretary from 2010 to 2015, turned 63 in late August - her sixth consecutive birthday marked in jail. Prosecutors, initially under former President Duterte, alleged that, as justice chief, de Lima conspired to receive payments from imprisoned drug lords. And in return, she tolerated their lucrative drug trade in the country's central prison. Her supporters are having none of it.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Chanting) Leila de Lima...\n\nUNIDENTIFIED GROUP: (Chanting) Happy birthday.\n\nMCCARTHY: Two dozen well-wishers greeted de Lima August 26 as she left one of the two trial courts hearing the criminal cases against her - cases that have been shaken by recanting witnesses. As de Lima headed back to jail, supporters shouted, free her, fake evidence and happy birthday. When asked her birthday wish, the one-time senator brightly replied...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nLEILA DE LIMA: Always freedom and vindication - soon.\n\nMCCARTHY: But if anything, de Lima's case demonstrates the glacial pace of justice in the Philippines. After nearly six years, there is no conviction or exoneration. Graft charges still loom. De Lima defense attorney, Dino de Leon, says the government manufactured cases against de Lima using coerced testimony from convicted felons with an axe to grind. He says, eight years ago, de Lima actually raided the country's maximum-security prison as justice secretary, dismantling the luxurious accommodations of drug baron inmates. By the time she was elected to the Senate in 2016, opponents were accusing de Lima of coddling drug lords, a charge she refuted on the floor of the Senate.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nDE LIMA: This is not only an attack against me, but against any senator who dares to be outspoken.\n\nMCCARTHY: She then pivoted to abuses of Duterte's national war on drugs as it was getting underway.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nDE LIMA: We cannot wage the war against drugs with blood. We will only be trading drug addiction with another, more malevolent kind of addiction. And this is the compulsion for more killing - killings that have now included even the innocent.\n\nMCCARTHY: The Philippines' DEA says 6,252 Filipinos have been killed in police narcotics operations since 2016. Rights groups say the number is at least four times that. De Lima first crossed swords with Duterte when she investigated then-Mayor Duterte for extrajudicial killings in Davao City, where alleged death squads targeted petty criminals and drug addicts. When de Lima launched a Senate investigation against Duterte's nationwide drug war in 2016, colleagues sidelined her. Duterte quipped at the time, de Lima wanted to implicate me, but it is she who will go to jail if her alleged links to the drug trade are actually proven.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nRODRIGO DUTERTE: If those connections are true, she will rot in jail. She will rot in jail. It's no bail.\n\nMCCARTHY: Drug offenses are nonbailable in the Philippines. De Lima penned a handwritten statement for NPR, delivered through her staff. She says she has lost her freedom because of vengeance, demonstrating, she says, how democracy can be dismantled in a bat of an eye. She continues - my case is a clear example of Duterte's willingness to commit a crime or to allow a crime to be committed, she says, in order to silence a critic. The office of the president, she writes, was being treated like a monarchical institution.\n\nSOCORRO REYES: It only shows how effective - how powerful government propaganda can be.\n\nMCCARTHY: That's Socorro Reyes, member of the Free Leila Committee and de Lima's professor at university. Reyes says the Philippines reflects the unseemly tactics of a global assault on liberal democratic values. The compliant House of Representatives even threatened to release a sex video ostensibly featuring the senator.\n\nREYES: It's the height of what you can do to a woman. So what we did is we started boasting, I am the woman in the video. I am the woman in the sex video, and I'm ready to appear.\n\nMCCARTHY: The House had no video show. Reyes says de Lima spent nearly her entire Senate term isolated in jail - no internet, cell phone or computer, few visitors besides the stray cats she's befriended. She still managed to handwrite influential legislation supporting the poor and elderly, says colleague Senator Koko Pimentel. Though de Lima lost reelection in May, I asked Pimentel...\n\nDoes she have something to teach the Senate, the Congress, elected officials?\n\nKOKO PIMENTEL: Of course, a lot - you know that you have to have principles in life, and it's not easy. You will be tested, and sometimes you will be persecuted for these principles.\n\nMCCARTHY: Political lecturer Arjan Aguirre of Ateneo de Manila University insists that Duterte carried out a political vendetta against de Lima. But Aguirre says she's an illustration of how Duterte targeted critics selectively so Filipinos would not perceive a threat to their democracy overall.\n\nARJAN AGUIRRE: They still think that we are in a democratic society, and Rodrigo Roa Duterte's, you know, trying his best to save us from an oligarchic rule.\n\nMCCARTHY: Legal observers say, closing in on six years, the de Lima affair may look more like arbitrary detention. Defense lawyer de Leon says one case has been dismissed. Two key witnesses retracted their stories in a second case. And in a third case, the evidence relies mainly on statements from convicted felons. De Leon says the defense might be able to show the government used the power of the state to invent allegations.\n\nDINO DE LEON: And actually using its machinery just to persecute an innocent person. But that has to be proven.\n\nMCCARTHY: A group of U.S. senators wants the new president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., to right what they call the injustices of his predecessor and clear de Lima of any wrongdoing. Massachusetts Democrat, Senator Ed Markey, recently led a delegation to Camp Crame inside the national police headquarters to visit the woman he calls a prisoner of conscience. Before, Duterte barred U.S. lawmakers from seeing de Lima, and so Markey said the visit offered a sign of progress. And while releasing de Lima could burnish the country's battered human rights image, Aguirre cautions that freeing her may not be on Manila's agenda.\n\nAGUIRRE: They will do more calculations, and my understanding there is that they will stick to the status quo. They will not release Senator Leila de Lima soon - soon.\n\nMCCARTHY: The presidential palace told NPR that it would leave the case to the trial court. The Justice Department said it would rely on the sound discretion of the court and did not respond to queries about its plans.

    "IKEA considering more stores in the Philippines": "SWEDISH furniture retailer IKEA is looking to establish more stores in the Philippines to address growing local demand and as part of its expansion efforts.\n\nGeorg Platzer, IKEA Philippines store manager, said that the retailer is studying more stores in Metro Manila in addition to its first branch in the country. IKEA Philippines opened the doors to its Pasay City store on Nov. 25 last year.\n\n“We need to have a second, and maybe even a third store in Metro Manila to cover the needs of the many consumers coming. No timing yet, no place yet but definitely on the expansion, it is on the drawing table,” Mr. Platzer said in an interview at the sidelines of a seminar in Pasay City last week.\n\n“The Pasay City store is the beginning for IKEA in the Philippines and there’s a future of more stores to come. It is just a matter of time. Because it is a big market, it is a growing market and in one moment, this store will be even too small to host so many people,” he added.\n\nIn terms of IKEA’s expansion outside of Metro Manila, Mr. Platzer said that the idea is “far from the pipeline.”\n\n“IKEA needs a certain amount of visitation. We live from visitation. We need a lot of visitors. Outside of Metro Manila, there [are] not enough people. And, if there [are] enough people, they need to travel a long way to come to IKEA. So, that would be a hindrance. We can think about cities like Cebu and maybe Davao, but I think that’s about it,” Mr. Platzer said.\n\nHowever, Mr. Platzer said that IKEA Philippines plans to add more “fulfillment areas” to serve more consumers buying online. The areas are where customers can pick up the products they purchased online.\n\n“We are about to stretch our fulfillment areas… In the future, we are going to serve more of the islands. Customers hopefully from Iloilo and Leyte can order online,” Mr. Platzer said.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Platzer said that IKEA Philippines had raised the prices of some of its products due to the depreciation of the Philippine peso versus the US dollar. He did not provide specific figures or products that had price increases.\n\nOn Sept. 23, the peso dropped to a new all-time low of P58.50 versus the greenback.\n\n“It’s a drama for us. The US dollar is too strong because we pay everything in dollars. We buy our goods in US dollars and that is not good,” Mr. Platzer said.\n\n“We always try to keep the prices as low as possible, and we still do. We still believe we have the lowest possible price in the country for this quality. But the whole currency challenge globally, the war in Europe with Russia and Ukraine, all these challenges have an impact on the supply chain and the prices,” he added. — Revin Mikhael D. Ochave",
    "Bangsamoro Peace and the U.S.-Philippines Alliance": "The election in May of Ferdinand Marcos Jr. as the 17th president of the Philippines presents an opportunity to reset U.S.-Philippines relations after six rocky years while President Rodrigo Duterte held the office. After Marcos’s sweeping election victory, President Biden called to congratulate him and then dispatched a series of U.S. officials to Manila, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken . Any concerns that the Marcos family’s corruption and lingering legal issues in the United States would hold up relations have been pushed aside due to the enormous interests the United States has in a functioning U.S.-Philippines alliance.\n\nDuring this honeymoon period, the Biden administration has prioritized reaffirming commitments under the Mutual Defense Treaty and Visiting Forces Agreement, which are fundamental to U.S.-Philippines defense cooperation and were often uncertain during Duterte’s tenure due to the former president’s hostility toward the United States and his attempts to deepen relations with Beijing. For the United States, the Marcos administration’s approach has been a breath of fresh air and has given U.S. officials hope that the United States will have reliable access to Philippines military facilities and that defense cooperation will increase in the coming years.\n\nHowever, the United States should be clear-eyed about the spectrum of threats that Manila sees. While the Philippines harbors deep concerns about China in the South China Sea, it is internal threats to the country’s stability that remain Manila’s priority and the overwhelming focus of its armed forces, often to the frustration of its U.S. alliance partners. But the reality is that until the Philippines is at peace internally — most importantly in Mindanao — Manila will be unable to focus adequately on the issues at the top of Washington’s agenda.\n\nFortunately, a hopeful but fragile peace process is underway in Mindanao. The initiative has the greatest potential in living memory to deliver a lasting peace, which would eliminate key drivers of poverty, instability, and violent extremism — and, strategically, would remove a major domestic demand on the Philippines’ security forces. While the United States has been engaged in a counterterrorism mission in Mindanao for more than two decades, it has not dedicated time and resources to peace efforts, despite strong interest from local parties. It’s time it did. Supporting a sustainable peace in the country’s south is an opportunity for strengthening the U.S.-Philippines alliance that is almost entirely divorced from high-level politics but would do much to shift Manila’s priorities.\n\nAn Opportunity for Peace in the Bangsamoro\n\nAfter decades of bloody conflict and cycles of failed peace efforts that spawned violent extremist breakaway groups in their aftermath, a peace deal between the Philippines government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) led to the establishment in 2019 of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), often referred to locally as “the Bangsamoro.” The BARMM’s approximately 5 million citizens are overwhelmingly Muslim, and its establishment marks the most significant endeavor since the arrival of the Spanish over 400 years ago for an autonomous polity in the Philippines’ Muslim heartland. However, while the peace process holds promise, it remains fragile.\n\nThe Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA), a body jointly appointed in 2019 by the MILF and the central government, to govern the BARMM until its first elections in May 2022, was faced with an unenviable task: build a government from scratch on the archipelago’s most impoverished and conflict-ridden island, amid the coronavirus pandemic. By March 2021, it was clear that the two-track peace process — in which the first track was working toward establishing the new, autonomous government and the second on demobilizing and disarming more than 40,000 MILF combatants — would not meet its objectives within the three-year transition period. With less than a year remaining in the original transition period, President Duterte signed into law a three-year extension of the transition period on October 28, 2021.\n\nDespite now having until May 2025 to complete the transition and prepare for the BARMM’s first elections, the pressure on the BTA, as well as the national government and their international partners, has intensified. Expectations are high because the current moment represents a historic opportunity to finally achieve a sustainable peace in a region where wars have killed more than 100,000 Filipinos and traumatized generations. In the BARMM, impatience and high expectations among the population are putting pressure on local authorities. These pressures have created divisions within the MILF that threaten not only to fracture the group, and with it the MILF-dominated BTA, but also to fuel outbreaks of violence that could derail peace efforts.\n\nMore broadly, there remains a constant threat of conflict in the region. While clan wars (rido) regularly displace thousands of people each month, unravel the social fabric, and hamper economic development, it is grinding insurgencies by Islamic State-affiliated groups that locals cite as the greatest violent threat to the peace process.\n\nAll of the Islamic State’s affiliates in the Philippines operate in the BARMM. The most prominent of these is the Dawlah group in Lanao del Sur that was responsible for the 2017 Marawi Siege and is led by Abu Zacharia, who is reportedly the current emir of Islamic State East Asia (ISEA) province. Other affiliates include a faction of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) in Maguindanao and splinter groups in the Sulu archipelago that broke away from the Abu Sayyaf Group. By almost all accounts, these violent extremist groups are less active and more fragmented than they were when the Islamic State declared its East Asia province several years ago, thanks to constant operations by the Philippines military and local populations trying to give peace a chance. Nonetheless, these groups are eager to spoil the governance transition and are constantly seeking openings to gain legitimacy as the BTA faces challenges in its efforts to establish an administration that delivers gains for the population.\n\nThe U.S. Interests in Peace\n\nWhile peace in the Bangsamoro is fragile, there are more reasons to be optimistic than pessimistic about its prospects. High expectations across the BARMM’s communities reflect their hopes that the BTA will deliver on promises of basic services, security and improved economic conditions. It is also clear that the BTA has tried to learn from the first three years of the transition and institutionalize those lessons to improve its performance in the time remaining. Concerns that there would be tensions between the Marcos administration and the MILF’s ministers in the BTA appear to have been assuaged, at least for now, with the BTA’s appointment of new ministers in August and the president’s public support for peace efforts.\n\nTo date, U.S. government support for the peace efforts in the Bangsamoro have been extremely limited. U.S. government officials are rarely seen in the BARMM, in contrast to representatives of U.N. agencies and the governments of Japan, Australia, and European countries, which have invested heavily in the peace process. In our meetings with senior members of the BTA in recent months, many wondered aloud about why the United States has not been engaged despite a clear U.S. interest in peace and the United States’ unique, though troubled colonial history in Mindanao. Local authorities are also interested in working with Washington on account of the U.S. government’s stature in Manila, which is greater than that of other international partners, and see it as a potentially influential interlocutor.\n\nThe United States could also gain from increased involvement in the peace process. Support for the transition in the works in the Bangsamoro could serve U.S. foreign policy interests in the region in two important ways. First, achieving peace would help address the root causes of why the United States has been engaged in a counterterrorism mission in Mindanao since 9/11. In 2003, when there was no viable peace process in place, the U.S. government asked the U.S. Institute of Peace to help facilitate a peace initiative, but it has not been engaged in such an endeavor since.\n\nSecond, a sustainable peace in the southern Philippines would remove a major domestic demand on the Philippines military’s resources and would allow it to reorient its policy focus toward external security. From the Pentagon’s perspective, the continued investment in ground forces and counterinsurgency is frustrating given the obvious maritime threats that the Philippines face from China. Until there is confidence in a sustainable peace, this dynamic will persist.\n\nA Crucial Three Year\n\nWith time ticking down before the deadline for the BTA to cede power to an elected government, the window of opportunity to ensure a successful transition and a sustainable peace is closing. Whether the BTA can confidently hand over power and complete the demobilization of MILF combatants will be key measures of success. With Islamic State-affiliated spoilers waiting in the wings and undermining the process, success is far from certain.\n\nThis three-year window presents an opportunity for the United States to engage. The BTA and key Bangsamoro civil society organizations are urgently seeking international training and advice on best practices for conflict prevention, reconciliation, peace messaging, returnee reintegration and peacebuilding approaches to preventing and countering violent extremism. The BTA also suffers from a basic lack of data on the attitudes and circumstances of the people of the BARMM, which has led to poorly informed public policy. The United States can help provide resources and expertise to help facilitate this transition.\n\nPerhaps more than important than this support, though, is the sense among stakeholders that international involvement will encourage the national government in Manila to continue to prioritize the peace process. At critical junctures, Duterte, the Philippines’ first president from Mindanao, expended political capital to support the peace process; there is less hope that the Marcos government would do the same. In close coordination with Japanese, Australian, European and U.N. partners that are already deeply committed, the United States has the potential to decisively tip the balance in the direction of peace — and at the same time make the Philippines a more stable and capable alliance partner.\n\nHaroro J.

    "Advantage LCA Tejas? Philippines Grounds Korean FA-50 Fighters; Both Jets Are Competing For Malaysian & Egyptian Contracts": "Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) have been hogging the limelight as many air forces around the world turn to these efficient and maneuverable jets. Out of the LCAs currently dominating the market, the South Korean FA-50 has emerged as a clear winner.\n\nThe Ministry of National Defense of Poland recently signed two contracts to purchase 48 FA-50 light attack aircraft from South Korea. The first 12 aircraft are slated for delivery next year, while the remaining 36 will be delivered between 2025 and 2028.\n\nHowever, even as the FA-50 fighter jets are winning hearts and contracts worldwide, an existing customer has made some new and unprecedented revelations about this combat aircraft.\n\nNews reports suggested earlier this month that there is a shortage of spare parts for the Philippines Air Force to operate the squadron of FA-50 fighter jets acquired from South Korea.\n\nIn response to these reports making the rounds, the Philippine Air Force (PAF) informed last week that its non-operational FA-50PH light jet fighters were undergoing mandatory scheduled maintenance. In simpler words, they have been grounded.\n\nThis has left the PAF with a reduced fleet size as there are just three operational FA-50PH fighters in its inventory.\n\n“While it is true that we have FA-50 aircraft that are currently on non-operational status, most of them are just ongoing scheduled maintenance which is mandatory precautionary checks, and they will be back in the air soon,” said Air Force spokesperson Col. Ma Consuelo Castillo, in a message to the Philippine News Agency.\n\nEarlier, EurAsian Times reported that South Korea appeared to be ahead in the race to supply fighter jets to Malaysia, with Chinese media indicating that the country is poised to sign an export contract for 18 FA-50s for $1 billion.\n\nWhile experts have contended that the news is speculative, the aircraft has emerged as a clear challenger to India’s LCA Tejas. The bid for 18 Light Combat Aircraft for the Malaysian Air Force has been down to two contenders: the Indian LCA Tejas by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and the Korean FA-50.\n\nThe wind was in favor of Tejas, with India offering a package deal to Malaysia; the FA-50’s rise as the popular global choice has come as a shocker to the Indian authorities. It’s not yet clear which fighter jet will roar over the Malaysian skies.\n\nThe FA-50 aircraft is also being pitched to Egypt, another country where India has been looking to sell LCA Tejas. To aid that effort, the manufacturer of Tejas, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), has also offered to set up production facilities in Egypt.\n\nBesides Poland and potentially Malaysia, FA-50 fighters have been sold to the Philippines and Iraq. The rise of FA-50 light combat aircraft that has made others in the market, including Tejas, run for their money warrants a close examination of the South Korean fighter jet.\n\nSouth Korea’s FA-50 Fighter Jet\n\nThe FA-50 Fighting Eagle is a supersonic light attack aircraft developed by KAI and Lockheed Martin. It is a multirole fighter variant of the ‘T-50’ line of aircraft, which comprises supersonic trainers, light combat aircraft, and multirole fighters.\n\nThe aircraft has a 4.5-ton weapons payload capacity and could be equipped with armament including the AIM-9 Sidewinder, AGM-65 Maverick, GBU-38/B, CBU-105 Sensor Fused Weapon, Mk-82 LDGP bombs, and Cluster Bomb Units.\n\nThe fighter plane also has an internal 20mm Gatling gun with three barrels and an LAU-3/A 19-tube 2.75′′ rocket launcher that can shoot folding-fin aerial rockets (FFAR). An afterburner-equipped GE F404 turbofan engine with a 17,700 lbf output powers the FA-50.\n\nIraq signed a contract with Korean Aerospace Industries in December 2013 to deliver 24 FA-50 derivative T-50IQ aircraft over 20 years, with additional equipment and pilot training.\n\nIn 2014, South Korea signed a $420 million contract with the Philippines to sell 12 light attack FA-50 fighters. The fighter was employed for the first time against ISIS-affiliated militants during the Battle of Marawi in the Philippines that began in 2017.\n\nMore recently, the Colombian Air Force chose a mix of 20 TA-50 and FA-50 Golden Eagles as its newest jet fighters and trainers in April 2022, followed by Poland signing a contract recently.\n\nWith Egypt and Malaysia emerging as potential customers for the FA-50, India’s Tejas is set for a tough fight.\n\nLight attack fighters have hogged the limelight as their modest size results in a low radar signature. Target acquisition is challenging due to the difficulty in spotting these fighter jets by radars. This gives them a better chance of spotting the heavy aircraft and firing the first shot.\n\nBoth LCA Tejas and KAI’s FA-50 fall under the category, and both aircraft have their share of advantages over the other.\n\nSince the LCA Tejas is eyeing the South East Asia market as its primary customer, it is expected to face a severe challenge from the Korean aircraft, which is already in use with some countries, making regional integration a favorable prospect for the FA-50.\n\nIn contrast, the HAL Tejas’ open architecture computer systems can incorporate both Russian and Western armaments, providing an edge to the Indian-made light fighter in markets that buy from both markets.\n\nEarlier, the UAE had shown interest in Tejas LCA in 2018. However, in February, the UAE Defense Ministry announced it was buying L-15 training and combat aircraft from China. The UAE also reportedly expressed interest in the TA-5O aircraft produced by South Korea.",
    "Ian’s future remains murky; Cat 4 Noru hits the Philippines": "The long-term future of Tropical Storm Ian still remains frustratingly obscure, as computer models forecasting its track remain obstinately in disagreement. Rapid intensification of Ian into a major category 3 or 4 hurricane remains highly probable, but whether or not the storm will impact the heavily populated west-central coast of Florida – or the less populated Big Bend and Panhandle areas – remains a mystery.\n\nAt 2 p.m. EDT Sunday, Ian was 265 miles south-southeast of Grand Cayman, with top winds of 50 mph, headed west-northwest at 12 mph. Ian was bringing heavy rain showers to Jamaica and eastern Cuba, as seen on Cayman Islands radar. Satellite imagery early Sunday afternoon showed that the symmetry, organization, and intensity of the storm’s heavy thunderstorms were steadily increasing. Ian had the look of a storm well on its way to becoming a hurricane, and it may now have a vertically aligned core that will allow it to rapidly intensify.\n\nIntensity forecast for Ian\n\nIan has nearly ideal conditions for intensification through Monday night: very warm water of 30 degrees Celsius (86°F) with a high heat content, light wind shear, excellent outflow channels aloft, and a moist atmosphere (a mid-level relative humidity of 70%). However, data from the Hurricane Hunters on Sunday morning showed that Ian’s vortex was still not aligned in the vertical, with the upper-level center displaced from the surface center. A tilted configuration does not allow for much intensification, but satellite imagery from Sunday afternoon suggests that Ian had solved this problem.\n\nIntensification is predicted on Monday, when Ian will be passing by the Cayman Islands and approaching western Cuba. Crossing Cuba is likely to interrupt the intensification process only briefly, as the few hours Ian spends over Cuba will not significantly disrupt its core. Ian is likely to resume intensification over the warm waters of the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday.\n\nThe 11 a.m. EDT Sunday National Hurricane Center forecast for Ian was aggressive, explicitly predicting rapid intensification. Beginning at 8 p.m. EDT Sunday, when Ian will be south of Jamaica, NHC predicts Ian will go from a tropical storm with 65-mph winds to a category 2 hurricane with 105-mph winds in 24 hours, exceeding the minimum definition of rapid intensification (a 35-mph increase in winds in 24 hours).\n\nBut by Wednesday conditions for intensification will become marginal, as a southwesterly flow of upper-level winds to the west of Ian brings an increase in wind shear; the 12Z Sunday run of the SHIPS model predicted a moderate 15-20 knots of wind shear would affect Ian on Wednesday, when the storm is expected to be to the west of Tampa. With dry air to the west of Ian at that time, the higher wind shear and drier air may cause a weakening of the storm. Wind shear will continue to increase as Ian heads farther north, and many of the models predict rapid weakening just before landfall on Thursday or Friday, if landfall occurs in the Florida Panhandle. However, Ian would be able to push a storm surge to the coast greater than its winds at landfall might suggest, as we have seen with several landfalling hurricanes in the Gulf. Examples include Katrina in 2005 (category 3 at landfall) and Ike in 2008 (category 2 at landfall).\n\nNHC currently has Ian topping out as a category 4 hurricane with 130 mph winds Tuesday night through Wednesday morning, when it will be to the west of Key West, Florida. The 12Z Sunday run of the DTOPS model gave a 93% chance that Ian would intensify by 75 mph in 72 hours. The top two intensity models for making 4- and 5-days forecast in 2021, the HMON and the HWRF, predicted with their 12Z Sunday runs that Ian would reach category 4 or 5 strength with 140-160 mph winds on Wednesday.\n\nSee more It's not often that our office is called upon to assist with tropical operations. The @NHC_Atlantic has asked several offices in the PacNW to release extra weather balloons in order to help them forecast for Tropical Cyclone Ian. #Hurricane #HurricaneSeason2022 pic.twitter.com/Rgu7fdo9Ej — NWS Medford (@NWSMedford) September 25, 2022\n\nTrack forecast for Ian\n\nThe spread in model track solutions for Ian continues to be unusually large, despite the continuous surveillance of the Hurricane Hunters and a doubling of the number of upper-air balloon soundings preformed at over 40 U.S. locations beginning on Saturday. One trend of note, though: The models have stopped shifting westward with their solutions, reducing the odds that a landfall will occur west of the Florida Panhandle, and increasing the odds that Tampa Bay will see severe impacts. The 12 Sunday runs of two of our top track models, the European and UKMET, were particularly concerning, showing a landfall near or to the south of Tampa Bay.\n\nFigure 1. A “superensemble” plot valid at 8 pm. EDT Wednesday, September 28, showing the tracks from four different global models and their ensembles. Model runs were performed at 0Z Sunday, September 25, 2022. Since the time this plot was created, the 12Z Sunday run of the GFS model made an eastward shift, closer to the other models. (Image credit: Tomer Burg)\n\nThe location of Ian’s landfall in Florida will depend upon the strength and orientation of the trough of low pressure pulling the storm northwards, and there are significant model differences on this point. So far, for the limited amount of time Ian has existed, the GFS model has out-performed all the other models – and the official NHC forecast – but that is no guarantee that the model is making good long-term forecasts for Ian: The GFS was the poorest-performing top-six model for 4- and 5-day forecasts for Hurricane Fiona (Figure 3). Now is a good time to remember that hurricanes stray outside the boundary of the “cone of uncertainty” about one-third of the time.\n\nSee more Here is the last few runs of the GFS forecast model. It's slowly coming east towards the European model. Lets see if other 12z models follow as well. pic.twitter.com/CKMrHJGfTh — Nicholas Isabella (@NycStormChaser) September 25, 2022\n\nFigure 2. Track error (in km) for 1- to 5-day forecasts made for Hurricane Fiona, September 14-24, 2022. There was no clearly superior model, and the official NHC forecast was noticeably better than any model for 4- and 5-day forecasts. Data taken from Brian Tang’s website.\n\nWhich model should you trust?\n\nFor those puzzling over the various hurricane computer forecast models to figure out which one to believe, the best answer is: Don’t believe any of them. Put your trust in the National Hurricane Center, or NHC, forecast.\n\nAlthough an individual model may outperform the official NHC forecast in some situations, the 2021 National Hurricane Center Forecast Verification Report documents that overall, it is very difficult for any one model to consistently beat the NHC forecasts for track and for intensity.\n\nIn 2021, the official NHC track forecasts for Atlantic storms were tough to beat, and none of the individual models outperformed the official forecast at any time period, when compared to a “no-skill” model called CLIPER5 (Figure 2). The CLIPER5 model (which combines the word “climatology” and “persistence” to show the nature of the forecasts it makes) is tough to outperform at short-term forecasts, since a hurricane will tend to keep moving in the same direction and at the same speed as at its initial point (this is called persistence). For that reason, the skill curve in Figure 1 shows relatively low skill for NHC forecasts for short-term forecasts out to one day; skill increases for forecasts between one and three days, when persistence tends not to be a good forecast (hurricanes generally don’t move in a straight line at a constant speed for days on end). Beyond three-day forecasts, NHC forecast skill starts to drop off, as the CLIPER5 model starts weighting its forecasts using climatology, which becomes tougher to beat at long ranges.\n\nThe GFS model was the best model in 2021, followed by the European model. The HWRF, HMON, COAMPS-TC, and CMC models did respectably for forecasts up to 72 hours; at longer time periods, the CMC and COAMPS-TC models performed poorly. The official 2021 NHC Atlantic track forecasts tended to have a northeast bias of 7-21 miles for one- to three-day forecasts (i.e., the official forecast tended to fall to the northeast of the verifying position).\n\nFigure 3. Skill of the top computer model forecasts of Atlantic named storms in 2021, compared to a “no skill” model called CLIPER5 that uses only climatology and persistence to make a hurricane track forecast (persistence assumes that a storm will tend to keep going in the direction and at the same speed that it is currently going).

(Image credit: NOAA/RAMMB/Colorado State University)\n\nTyphoon Noru shocks the Philippines with a Cat 4 landfall\n\nTyphoon Noru put on a spectacular, unexpected, and extremely dangerous rapid intensification feat in the waters just east of the Philippines on Saturday, becoming one of the fastest-intensifying cyclones in modern Earth history. Noru’s peak 1-minute wind strength, as gauged by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), increased from 50 mph (medium tropical-storm strength) at 2 p.m. EDT Friday to 155 mph (top end of the category 4 range) at 2 p.m. EDT Saturday. According to Jasper Deng, who manages tropical cyclone information at Wikipedia, this increase of 105 mph in 24 hours is the fifth largest in global records, topped only by Hurricane Patricia in the eastern Pacific in 2015 (120 mph), Typhoon Hagibis in the northwestern Pacific in 2019 (115 mph), Tropical Cyclone Ambali in the South Indian in 2019 (115 mph), and Tropical Cyclone Ernie in the South Indian in 2017 (110 mph). All of these record-intensifying tropical cyclones occurred in the past seven years. Warmer oceans from human-caused climate change greatly boost the odds of extreme rapid intensification events like these (see Jeff Masters’ 2020 post on such trends in the Atlantic).\n\nSee more #Noru is going to steal the crown from #Hinnamnor per JTWC's latest forecast and threaten central Philippines as a (mid-tier) Category 5 typhoon. pic.twitter.com/j9At33Ag01 — Minghao Zhou (@Minghao_Zhou) September 24, 2022\n\nNoru made landfall on the Philippines’ Luzon Island about 35 miles northeast of the capital of Manila shortly before 12Z (8 a.m. EDT) Sunday. At 12Z, the JTWC rated Noru as a category 4 typhoon with 130 mph winds – a decrease in winds of 20 mph compared to six hours earlier, at 6Z. Noru was on a west- to west-northwest track late Sunday local time that would take it about 30 miles north of Manila. This is unusually close for a strong typhoon to be passing to the city, whose metropolitan area has a population over 21 million: The database of storms from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) lists only six major (category 3 and stronger) typhoons that have passed within 50 miles of Manila. Noru’s small size may allow it to pass far enough north of Manila to limit winds there to tropical storm strength, but this heavily populated area should be prepared for potentially severe impacts from the typhoon.\n\nSee more Incredible storm surge in Polillo, Quezon, Philippines which was hit by the eyewall of #KardingPH / #Noru.pic.twitter.com/TiSH4di3br — Ben Noll (@BenNollWeather) September 25, 2022\n\nNoru will emerge into the South China Sea after spending about eight hours crossing over Luzon, whose rugged terrain of Luzon is expected to disrupt the typhoon to category 1 status. Re-intensification into a category 3 storm is expected by Tuesday night (U.S. EDT), when Noru will make landfall in central Vietnam.\n\nNoru is Earth’s second Cat 5 storm so far in 2022. The first was Super Typhoon Hinnamnor, which peaked with 160 mph winds at 8 a.m. EDT Tuesday, August 30, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). This year is running behind the usual pace for Cat 5s: The 1990-2021 average is 5.3 Cat 5s per year, according to ratings by the National Hurricane Center and Joint Typhoon Warning Center.\n\nTropical Storm Gaston dying near the Azores in central Atlantic\n\nTropical Storm Gaston, with sustained winds of 50 mph at 11 a.m. EDT Sunday, is expected to become post-tropical on Monday as it heads west at 12 mph away from the Azores Islands.\n\nTropical Storm Hermine dies in far eastern Atlantic\n\nTropical Storm Hermine became a post-tropical cyclone in the waters 580 miles north-northeast of the Cabo Verde Islands on Sunday morning. Hermine’s remnants are predicted to bring total rainfall amounts of 3 – 6 inches to the Canary Islands through Monday.\n\nOne other wave to watch: 99L\n\nA tropical wave in the central Atlantic, several hundred miles west of the Cabo Verde Islands, was designated Invest 99L by NHC. The wave is in a dry environment (mid-level relative humidity of 50%), but sea surface temperatures are warm and wind shear is moderate, which could allow some slow development. Satellite imagery showed that 99L had developed a broad surface circulation, but had a limited amount of disorganized heavy thunderstorm activity. The wave has only limited model support for development as it wanders mostly northwest at less than 5 mph, far from any land areas. In its 2 p.m. EDT Sunday Tropical Weather Outlook, NHC gave 99L 2-day and 5-day development odds of 20% and 30%, respectively.\n\nFigure 5. Potential storm surge flooding in Tampa Bay from a category 1 hurricane. (Image credit: The National Hurricane Center Storm Surge Risk Maps)\n\nSunday evening update: Increasing risk of a damaging storm surge in Tampa Bay\n\nWhile the exact track and intensity of Ian as it approaches Florida will determine whether or not Tampa Bay receives a damaging storm surge, the current NHC cone of uncertainty – combined with the current intensity forecast – gives Tampa Bay a high chance of receiving a damaging storm surge, characteristic of a category 1 hurricane or stronger. The National Hurricane Center Storm Surge Risk Maps are helpful to see the levels of inundation one might expect for various Saffir-Simpson category hurricanes, and they paint an alarming picture of how vulnerable the Tampa Bay region is (Figure 5). For a category 1 hurricane, the map shows that Pinellas County – home to St. Petersburg, and over one million people – may become completely cut off from the mainland. Portions of all four connecting bridges, as well as the main highway leading north – U.S. Highway 19 – will potentially be under as much as six feet of water. These evacuation routes would likely be cut off well before a hurricane arrives.\n\nFigure 6.

    "Philippines: 'Communist' book bans raise new censorship fears": "Independent authors and book publishers in the Philippines are coming under pressure for alleged ties to the country's Communist Party and for criticizing the government.\n\nIn August, the Commission on the Filipino Language (KWF) issued a memorandum calling for the removal of books containing \"subversive, anti-Marcos and anti-Duterte contents\" from public libraries.\n\nThe statement refers to former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, and his successor, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., both of whom have pursued hard-line policies towards the media.\n\nThe KWF statement alleged its own chairman, Arthur Casanova, had approved the books without its consent, saying it publishes books focused on \"linguistics, grammar and ethnography.\"\n\nThe board of commissioners called Casanova's actions \"illegal\" and an \"attack on the government.\" It added Casanova should be held responsible for \"wasting taxpayers' money and inciting rebellion.\"\n\nCasanova responded, warning that labeling books \"subversive\" is a \"dangerous accusation which may already be stepping on the boundaries of freedom of expression and academic freedom.\"\n\nIn another case, a recent video posted on a pro-Marcos YouTube channel by Lorraine Badoy, the former head of a task force to end \"Communist insurgency,\" tagged more than a dozen books by Filipino authors as anti-government because they included references written by the Communist Party of the Philippines.\n\nThe channel, SMNI News, has over 1.2 million subscribers.\n\nIn response, concerned citizens have taken to Twitter under the #HandsOffOurLibraries hashtag and set up a website documenting a \"book censorship spree\" across different provinces.\n\nDexter Cayanes, one of the authors who was red-tagged, said it he is falling victim to \"certain political interests.\"\n\nFamous banned books over the decades Accused of blasphemy Salman Rushdie has faced death threats for \"The Satanic Verses,\" banned in several countries for its blasphemous portrayal of the Prophet Muhammad. On August 12, 2022, 24-year-old suspect Hadi Matar stabbed Rushdie multiple times just before he gave a public lecture in New York. Matar, who said Rushdie \"was someone who attacked Islam,\" has pleaded not guilty for assault and attempted murder.\n\nFamous banned books over the decades Germany's Oscar nominee \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" by Erich Maria Remarque is an unvarnished look at life on the German front during World War I, as told by 20-year-old protagonist, Paul Baumer. Seen by many critics as a key anti-war book, it was banned and burned under the Nazi regime in Germany. The first German-language film adaptation of the book is now a best international film contender for the 2023 Oscars.\n\nFamous banned books over the decades A book about book burning This 1953 dystopian novel by Ray Bradbury tells of an American society of the future where books are outlawed — and burnt if discovered. In the 1990s one US school district refused for the use of the word \"goddamn.\" It has also been challenged on the basis of \"questionable themes\" like censorship, repression and religion. It is often regarded as one of Bradbury's best works.\n\nFamous banned books over the decades When animals shouldn't speak George Orwell's \"Animal Farm\" features a group of farm animals who rebel against their human farmer, hoping to create a society where they can be equal, free, and happy. It was a swipe at corruption in the former Soviet Union, and was banned there until the 1980s. Schools in the United Arab Emirates also banned it in 2002 for depicting a talking pig, an animal considered unclean in Islam.\n\nFamous banned books over the decades 'The Book That Should Not Be Read' Despite its global acclaim and success that saw both children and adults devouring the entire \"Harry Potter\" series written by British author J.K.Rowling, the books have been targeted for removal from American school libraries as they dealt with ghosts, cults and witchcraft.\n\nFamous banned books over the decades An anti-family children's book \"And Tango makes Three\" is based on the true story of two male penguins in a New York zoo who raise a chick together. Pro-family organisations and individuals in the US criticized it and called for its censorship for being \"anti-ethnic\" and \"anti-family\" to \"unsuited to age group.\" In Singapore, where homosexuality is illegal, it was first pulled from libraries but later moved to 'adult' sections.\n\nFamous banned books over the decades Not banned in the US In Vladimir Nabokov's 1955 novel \"Lolita\" is about a middle-aged college professor who is obsessed with a twelve-year-old daughter whom he sexually exploits. In today's plain language, he's a pedophile. Unsurprisingly, it was banned as obscene over different periods in France, England, Argentina and New Zealand. Shockingly, it wasn't banned in the United States, though it was challenged.\n\nFamous banned books over the decades A blanket ban His debut, the 1987 short-story collection \"Stick Out Your Tongue,\" highlighted the brutal Chinese occupation of Tibet. The government condemned the book as “spiritual pollution” and permanently banned Ma's books from the country. Ma himself was banned from China after the publication of his 2013 novel, \"The Dark Road,\" about the impact of the nation’s one-child policy.\n\nFamous banned books over the decades Airing inconvenient truths Said to be the most-challenged book in the US from 2010 to 2019, Publishers Weekly described this YA novel as the “Native American equivalent of 'Angela’s Ashes,' a coming-of-age story so well observed that its very rootedness in one specific culture is also what lends it universality, and so emotionally honest that the humor almost always proves painful.”\n\nFamous banned books over the decades Nobel laureate who will not be silenced Lawyer Shirin Ebadi was one of Iran's first female judges. After the 1979 revolution, she was dismissed from her position. Ebadi opened a legal practice and began defending people who were being persecuted by the authorities. Despite being the first female peace prize laureate from the Islamic world, her memoir \"Iran Awakening\" is banned in her native country for its political content.\n\nFamous banned books over the decades Enforcing racial stereotypes Despite being acknowledged as one of the best American novels ever written, Mark Twain's 1884 novel \"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\" is frequently challenged in the US over its depiction of racial stereotypes. The N-word is used 242 times in the novel, leading one administrator to brand it the “most grotesque example of racism I’ve ever seen in my life.”\n\nFamous banned books over the decades (In)famous ban backtrack Famed Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei's “Dialogue on the Two World Systems” published in 1632 was originally banned by the Catholic Church for suggesting that the earth orbited the sun, and he was accused of heresy back then. It wasn't until 1822 that this ban was lifted and finally in 1992, Pope John Paul II and the the Pontifical Academy of Sciences officially declared that Galileo was right. Author: Brenda Haas\n\n\n\nScale of crackdown 'alarming'\n\nLast year, a Philippine government task force to \"end local Communist armed conflict\" cooperated with the military on the removal of books considered anti-government from libraries in state-run academic institutions.\n\nMost of the books in questiondocumented the Communist insurgency in the Philippines and peace negotiations with the Communist Party.\n\nLa Solidaridad is an iconic, independent bookstore in Manila, which is a popular hang-out for writers and literary enthusiasts. After the task force began its work, the store was vandalized with red paint, ostensibly marking it as part of the \"Communist\" movement in the Philippines.\n\nTonet Jose, who owns and manages La Solidaridad, told DW that while he is not a stranger to state repression of freedom of expression, the magnitude of the government crackdown is alarming.\n\n\"But I still see hope. After the news of the book ban came out, a lot of people came into the store looking to buy copies of the banned titles,\" Jose said.\n\nWhitewashing history of Marcos dictatorship?\n\nEarlier this year, the head of the national intelligence agency accused children's book publisher Adarna House of subtly \"radicalizing\" Filipino youth. Adarna House had bundled a collection of children's storybooks about the martial law era and the brutal dictatorship of the current president's father, Ferdinand Marcos, Sr.\n\nThe curated collection was in response to public demand for books that would educate the younger generation of Filipinos about the crime and corruption during the Philippines' two-decades long military rule.\n\nOn September 21, the Philippines marks the 50th anniversary of the declaration of martial law, an era which lasted from 1972 until 1981 and saw thousands of activists killed or jailed.\n\nSeveral reports have shown that a massive and well-orchestrated disinformation campaign by the Marcoses was crucial in influencing public opinion and securing the presidency for the late dictator's son.\n\nPhilippines whitewashes history as Marcos Jr. takes office\n\nRecently, a pro-Marcos movie was produced portraying the Marcoses as victims of the 1986 peaceful People's Power Revolution that ousted them from power.\n\nDocumentary filmmaker Alyx Arumpac, told DW that filmmaking has the power to influence the opinion wide audiences, and both sides of an issue use the medium to get complex messages across.\n\n\"This type of storytelling can also be an effective tool at countering the myths that the Marcoses have built for themselves,\" Arumpac told DW.\n\n\"Documentary films hold memories and evidence. In that sense, a documentary film serves as a clear record of the past. And that record will stand for decades to come,\" she said.\n\nArumpac's film \"ASWANG\" documented the brutalities of the Duterte Administration's drug war.\n\nIt enjoyed a wide viewing and won accolades worldwide. Arumpac has not been red-tagged but has been barraged by online threats of rape and death since the release of her movie.\n\nA turning point for culture in the Philippines\n\nAuthors, academics and human rights activists warn an entire state machinery is being implemented to target dissent.\n\nCristina Palabay, secretary general of human rights group Karapatan, said in a recent statement that the state-sponsored crackdown on books is an attempt to \"deny the public of much-needed literature and materials encouraging critical thinking and knowledge on Filipino history and language.\"\n\nFaye Cura, founder of independent feminist book publishing collective Gantala Press, told DW that the intensity of the state's attacks is an indication of how much the government is threatened by the a cultural movement fighting against historical revisionism and disinformation.\n\n\"Even more so now, cultural workers must resist all forms of censorship and the silencing of people,\" said Cura.\n\nEdited by: Wesley Rahn",

It was last located over the coastal waters of Zambales province in central Luzon and headed to the South China Sea on its way to Vietnam.\n\nNoru, which hit land as a super typhoon, has weakened from the sustained winds of 195km/h and gusts of up to 240km/h recorded on Sunday. Heavy to intense rains are expected over the capital region and agricultural provinces on the main Luzon island until early Monday morning, the local weather bureau said.\n\nMarcos, in a Facebook post, said he has approved the recommendation of the disaster coordinating council to halt government work and school classes in Metro Manila and several regions on Monday.\n\nThe Bankers Association of the Philippines, the Philippine Stock Exchange and the Philippine Dealing System late Sunday announced separately there will be no trading in the foreign exchange, stock and bond markets on Sept 26. The Bureau of the Treasury delayed by a day the regular bills and bonds auctions to Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nAbout 20 cyclones pass through the Philippines each year, causing loss of lives and damage to homes, infrastructure and agriculture.\n\nFarmland that may be affected by the typhoon could reach 1.47 million hectares where 75% of the nation’s standing rice crops are planted, the Department of Agriculture said Sunday, which risks fanning inflation.\n\nIn 2013, Super Typhoon Haiyan killed more than 6,300 in the Southeast Asian nation. In September 2009, Typhoon Ketsana killed more than 460 people and caused 11 billion pesos (US$188 million) of damage to infrastructure and agriculture after dumping a month’s worth of rain on the capital region in a day.\n\nNoru, the 11th tropical cyclone to hit the Philippines this year, could trigger Philippines’ catastrophe bonds, according to Artemis, which monitors catastrophe bonds, insurance-linked securities and weather risk markets.\n\n“Super typhoon Noru’s route across the Philippines will take it close to highly populated areas, with the capital city Manila likely to feel the effects of typhoon strength winds and significant rainfall,” according to Artemis. “At such intense wind speeds, super typhoon Noru is a significant threat to the Philippines, in damage and loss of life terms.”\n\nPreemptive evacuation were made in provinces that will be on the typhoon’s path particularly in coastal and disaster prone areas, according to local media including ABS-CBN and the Philippine Daily Inquirer.\n\nAs early as noon Sunday, more than 2,500 people were stranded in various ports as sea travel was halted, the Philippine Coast Guard said. More than 40 domestic and five international flights were cancelled on Sunday, the Manila International Airport Authority said.\n\nAyala Land Inc, one of the nation’s biggest developers, shut its shopping malls early and allowed shoppers to wait out the storm inside the facility for safety. SM Prime Holdings Inc, the largest shopping mall operator, said free wifi and charging stations will be provided to customers.\n\nThe weather bureau warned of “at times torrential rains” in Metro Manila and over two dozen provinces through early afternoon Monday. “Widespread flooding and rain-induced landslides are expected, especially in areas that are highly or very highly susceptible to these hazard,” it said.",

    "Philippines sea level rising 3 times faster than world average: Expert": "September 23, 2022\n\nMANILA — The sea level in the Philippines is rising three times faster than the global average, putting many of its coastal villages in peril, according to a climate scientist of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa).\n\nWith 70 percent of the country’s municipalities facing large bodies of water, including the Pacific Ocean, that could spell a “big impact” on those populations, Rosalina de Guzman, chief of the state weather bureau’s climate data section, said on Thursday.\n\n“Based on a report done by Pagasa, we saw that the sea-level rise of the Philippines is rising three times faster compared to the global average,” De Guzman said during the Laging Handa briefing.\n\n“So, this can cause inundation of low-lying areas, especially many of our countrymen who live on the beach,” she said.\n\nThe Philippines has one of the world’s longest coastlines, stretching more than 36,000 kilometers.\n\nWarming temperatures\n\nScientists attribute sea level rise to warming temperatures, which melt the polar ice caps, causing oceans to expand.\n\nIn April, Pagasa climate scientist Dr. Marcelino Villafuerte said the sea level in the Philippine Sea had risen by about 12 centimeters, or about 5 inches, over the past two decades.\n\nDe Guzman did not explain what was causing the phenomenon.\n\nBut according to the World Bank’s climate change portal, regional variations in the rise of sea levels exist “due to natural variability in regional winds and ocean currents, which can occur over periods of days to months or even decades.”\n\nFewer, stronger typhoons\n\nWhile typhoons hitting the country are becoming fewer, those that do make landfall are becoming stronger and a bit more frequent, De Guzman noted.\n\nAn average of 20 tropical cyclones enter the Philippine area of responsibility every year, with about eight or nine crossing the country.\n\n“Based on our data, we have seen that the frequency of typhoons is decreasing a bit and we have seen that for those greater than 170 kilometers per hour, there is a slight change, there is a slight increase,” De Guzman said.\n\nBased on Pagasa projections, she said the country’s temperature will rise by 4 degrees by the end of the 21st century while the intensity of typhoons hitting the country will continue to increase.\n\nTo help address this, she said climate change mitigation should be “fully integrated in the planning process” of the government, including earmarking funds to address the impact of climate change and build resilience among communities in low-lying coastal areas.\n\nDe Guzman also urged the public to “practice energy efficiency” and recycling, including conserving water and using mass transport.\n\nThe World Bank said rising sea levels “create not only stress on the physical coastline, but also on coastal ecosystems.”\n\n“Saltwater intrusions can be contaminating freshwater aquifers, many of which sustain municipal and agricultural water supplies and natural ecosystems. As global temperatures continue to warm, sea level will keep rising for a long time because there is a substantial lag to reaching an equilibrium,” it said. “The magnitude of the rise will depend strongly on the rate of future carbon dioxide emissions and future global warming, and the speed might increasingly depend on the rate of glacier and ice sheet melting,” it added.\n\n‘Greatest threat’\n\nIn April, then President Rodrigo Duterte called on industrialized nations to pay smaller countries like the Philippines reparations for the damage caused by climate change.\n\n“We produce the least but we suffer the most. We are really the one paying for it the most. The pollution produced by other countries, we are the ones who catch it,” he said.\n\nAddressing world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, President Marcos amplified his predecessor’s point, calling climate change the “greatest threat affecting our nations and peoples.”\n\n“The Philippines, for example, is a net carbon sink. We absorb more carbon dioxide than we emit. And yet, we are the fourth most vulnerable country to climate change,” he said on Wednesday (Manila time).\n\n“There is no other problem so global in nature that it requires a united effort, one led by the United Nations. The effects of climate change are uneven and reflect a historical injustice,” Marcos said.\n\nIn response to calls from the leaders of developing nations, including the Philippines, United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres said on Thursday it was time for “meaningful action” on the issue of compensation for damage wrought by the climate crisis. — WITH A REPORT FROM AFP",
    "Canada prefers FTA with Asean over bilateral deal with Philippines": "Canada has expressed preference for a free trade agreement with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) instead of one with the Philippines, dampening the hopes of some groups that a bilateral trade deal between the two countries will be forged.\n\nPeter MacArthur, Canadian ambassador to the Philippines, said this on Tuesday of last week at the sidelines of the press conference during the visit of the north American country’s’ minister of international trade, export promotion, small business and economic development, Mary Ng.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“The focus right now is on the Asean-Canada Free Trade Agreement (FTA),” MacArthur told the Inquirer, referring to the economic agreement which has been under official negotiations since November last year.\n\nEarlier this month, Canadian Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines president Julian Payne said the southeast Asian country should seek a free trade agreement with Canada.\n\nPayne cited it would benefit both countries in terms of tariff reductions.\n\nAsean-Canada trade\n\nHistorically, Asean has forged collective trade deals with different countries in the past and was successful, but such negotiations were often subjected to prolonged deadlocks due to the need for consensus from multiple members.\n\nEven within the Asean itself are informal coalitions of member states with competing and sometimes incompatible agenda.\n\nCiting Canada’s statistics, Asean said that bilateral trade relations between the two parties remained strong despite the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, with the total two-way merchandise trade reaching $19.9 billion during the said year.\n\nBy the end of 2020, the stock of foreign direct investments from Canada to Asean member states stood at $12.5 billion, while the stock of the same from Asean member states to Canada was $1.2 billion.\n\n“The FTA would strengthen Asean-Canada economic relations, connect Asean closer to the global value chains and improve market access for both Asean and Canadian firms,” said Asean Secretary General Dato Lim Jock Hoi in 2021 during the official launch of the negotiations between Canada and the regional bloc.\n\nPhilippine-Canada trade\n\nLast week, Ng highlighted that trade between Canada and the Philippines has grown in the last year, up by more than 30 percent in 2021 totaling about P121.2 billion or 2.8 billion Canadian dollars.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“What this really means in people terms is that trade helps create jobs for both our people, opening up new doors for small businesses and helping each other grow in our economies, which is so important at this time as we are all recovering from COVID-19,” Ng said during a press conference on the last day of her three-day visit.\n\nThe Canadian official also said their government would be providing P519.6 million in funding for the Philippines for three key development areas: climate finance, women empowerment and the Bangsamoro Normalization Trust Fund.\n\nCanada has provided P160.2 billion in development funds to the Philippines since the year 2000.

McKinney School of Law discusses Rodrigo Duterte and the ICC's probe into potential crimes against humanity in the Philippines…\n\nThe new government of Ferdinand Marcos Jr and Sara Duterte is employing tricks and propaganda to entrench impunity and ward off the International Criminal Court’s long-delayed probe of crimes against humanity committed during former president Rodrigo Duterte’s reign of terror.\n\nThe latest of these ploys is the government’s attempt, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), to cripple efforts by ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan to resume his investigation into the murder of an estimated 12,000-30,000 civilians by death squads during Duterte’s so-called “war on drugs.” On September 8, the OSG opposed Khan’s request before the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber I claiming that the thousands of killings do not amount to crimes against humanity.\n\nThis is but the latest tool in the government’s toolbox of labyrinthic maneuvers to delay and defeat the ICC’s investigation and prosecution of Duterte and his top officials for one of the gravest human rights violations in Asia.\n\nOn September 15, 2021, the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber I granted the ICC Office of the Prosecutor’s (OTP) request for authorization to commence a preliminary investigation. Asking to defer the investigation, the government upended the ICC’s efforts on November 10, 2021. The OTP, thus, “temporarily suspended its investigative activities.”\n\nAuthorities know too well that the longer they bar ICC investigators from entering the country and gaining access to evidence, the greater the chances of wiping all traces of the wide scale murders. Victims not only lack the economic and political means to claim justice but face grave reprisals from the powers-that-be as well.\n\nContrary to the OSG’s claims, former president Duterte and Marcos-Duterte’s governments are both unwilling and unable to investigate and prosecute former president Duterte and the leaders of the “death squads” for the widespread and systematic slaughter of civilians.\n\n“Prisoner of conscience”\n\nThe government claims that the country’s legal and judicial processes are soundly working, repudiating then ICC chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda’s determination that crimes against humanity have been committed in violation of the Rome Statute of the ICC. However, this is belied by the prolonged and unconscionable jailing since February 24, 2017 of Senator Leila de Lima. Her only “crime” is to have the principles, integrity, and fortitude to investigate, as then chairperson of the Commission on Human Rights, and later as chairperson of the Senate Committee on Justice and Human Rights, the alleged targeted killings on orders of mayor-turned-president Duterte.\n\nPolitical dynamics\n\nDespite the fact that Duterte’s own daughter sits as vice president, human rights and democratic forces are trying to break Duterte’s impunity and fortify the rule of international human rights law.\n\nInternational criminal lawyers need to examine the political dynamics and context in which the Marcos-Duterte government is employing its latest legal move. International human rights actors need to analyze these dynamics and view them as connected to and as being part of the government’s attempts to avoid justice for crimes against humanity and other vicious forms of continuing human rights violations. This approach will enable the international community to anticipate how the ICC’s stalled investigation will fare in years to come.\n\nEven at the earliest stages of the targeted killings of civilians on a wide scale by then president Duterte, the government was already deploying deceptive and bullying tactics to cover up, deflect and smother criticism and denunciations from Bensouda and the rest of the international community. At one point, Duterte’s army of paid apologists and trolls conjured up wild claims that the slain civilians, who mostly belonged to the poorest of the poor, were allegedly killed by rival drug gangs. They even made the ludicrous claim that drug lords were funding human rights defenders who, despite great risks to themselves, were strongly condemning the cold-blooded murders. The government even falsely claimed that Rappler – whose independent and courageous journalists, including Nobel laureate Maria Ressa, have been fearlessly documenting, investigating, and reporting on the systematic murder of unarmed civilians –was backed by the CIA. They did this in order to obfuscate Duterte’s repeated public calls to kill alleged drug pushers and petty criminals, punctuated with his signature cursing, broadcast on multiple occasions nationwide.\n\nWar on human rights\n\nEventually, Duterte’s murderous frenzy spilled over to the killing of environmental and human rights defenders, including journalists and lawyers, especially after the breakdown of peace negotiations between his government and the National Democratic Front, an underground organization that includes the Communist Party of the Philippines-led New People’s Army.\n\nLawfare became a staple for government apologists, amplified by trolls, who systematically and viciously maligned, intimidated, red-tagged, and harassed independent and principled journalists, human rights and environmental lawyers and defenders, and civil society advocates. The government primarily targeted the constitutionally independent Commission on Human Rights headed by the late Chito Gascon in its smear campaign. Sycophants in congress even attempted to allocate a measly sum of one peso for CHR’s annual budget to ingratiate themselves to Duterte.\n\nMedia campaigns\n\nThe government uses social media in its witch hunt, leading to deadly consequences for those who are red-tagged. Principled and courageous human rights and environmental lawyers and defenders suffer not only from character assassination and political persecution, but also from treacherous ambushes, assassinations, trumped up charges, and unjust imprisonment. Those wrongfully imprisoned and murdered include priests, human rights defenders, lawyers, judges, farmers, workers, indigenous people, and community and trade union organizers.\n\nExpectedly, the Marcos-Duterte duo is resorting to black propaganda to undermine the ICC’s credibility and mandate to investigate and bring Duterte to trial.\n\nIn this age of fake news and government organized disinformation, people need to be vigilant and methodically act on a sustained and long-term basis to raise awareness about the true nature of the the ICC’s mandate.\n\nWitch hunt\n\nOverall, the police forces and military appear to have remained stuck for decades in a cold war ideology and the national security doctrine, ignoring quantum leaps in the development of international human rights law, international humanitarian law, international criminal law, and international environmental law. The police and military mindset seems to rigidly harbor the myopic view that the peaceful exercise of the democratic right to dissent on the part of the people, particularly journalists and political activists, means they are so-called “communists” or “terrorists.” By and large, police and military imply through red-baiting that being vigilant in safeguarding democratic, human and environmental rights makes one a true blue “communist terrorist.”\n\nThe series of killings of red-tagged personalities and alleged communist leaders seems reminiscent of what happened in the aftermath of the 1965 coup wherein the military summarily killed 80,000-1 million alleged members and sympathizers of the Communist Party of Indonesia (Partai Komunis Indonesia, PKI).\n\nConjuring up the “communist” and “terrorist” bogeyman, the government came up with the Anti-Terror Act. Citing the Maoist-oriented New People’s Army insurgents, the government has been shooting from the hip, indiscriminately red-tagging and arresting and jailing unarmed civilians on trumped-up charges. The Anti-Money Laundering Council has been using this law to freeze, without due process of law, the financial accounts of individuals and nongovernmental organizations engaged in grassroots developmental work. To be red-tagged is tantamount to being issued a death warrant by armed state actors, notably the police, military, and their “force multipliers.”\n\nDestroying the rule of law\n\nNothing illustrates this cold war archetype more than the ₱17 billion budget allocated for 2022 by congress to the National Task Force to End the Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC). Defenders of environmental and human rights and democracy, including lawyers and journalists, find themselves at the receiving end of the NTF-ELCAC’s red-tagging assaults, with police and military backing up its nefarious witch hunts. This is a violation of the police and military’s legal obligation to respect, protect, promote, and fulfill the constitutionally guaranteed human rights of these civilians, especially to exercise their right to free speech, press, expression, association, and assembly.\n\nThe government’s red-tagging activities, coupled with multiple assassinations, seem calculated to silence exposés of official corruption and abuse of power. These witch hunters undermine and destroy the country’s democratic institutions and, ultimately, the rule of law.\n\nMilitary and police institutions are among the elements fighting against the ICC’s push to investigate the 12,000-30,000 civilian deaths at the hands of the police, their “force multipliers,” and so-called “vigilantes” believed to be undercover state agents themselves. Aside from police and military institutions, members of Duterte’s own political dynasty, proteges in congress, courts, and executive departments and offices, like the OSG and the Department of Justice, are attempting to thwart the ICC’s attempts to gather evidence of crimes against humanity penalized under the Rome Statute.\n\nDemocratic voices\n\nThankfully, there are factors that can overcome the hurdles that the government puts up to quell attempts to seek accountability for the worst ever crimes committed against civilians in the country’s post-World War II history. These crimes surpass the dark human rights record of Marcos’ own father, the late pillager and despot Ferdinand Marcos Sr during martial law. These crimes are equaled by, if they do not surpass, the atrocities committed by the Spanish guardia civil, by American occupation forces, and by Japanese invaders. These factors include:\n\nthe internationally backed creation, mandate, and operation of the ICC with its track record of strict adherence to the Rome Statute of the ICC, judicial precedents, and its core legal documents\n\nthe existence of victims of crimes against humanity in the country who courageously participated in the ICC pre-trial proceedings despite risks of reprisal from authorities and the abject lack of domestic institutional mechanisms to safeguard, conceal, and protect their identity, location and wellbeing\n\nof crimes against humanity in the country who courageously in the ICC pre-trial proceedings despite risks of reprisal from authorities and the abject lack of domestic institutional mechanisms to safeguard, conceal, and protect their identity, location and wellbeing the existence of principled, independent, courageous and committed lawyers, human rights and environmental defenders, church, and civil society advocates with high level ground and operational expertise, international networks, and capacity for timely documentation and dissemination of human rights alerts\n\nthe existence of independent, principled, courageous and committed investigative journalists, steeped in the adversarial tradition of journalism, such as those belonging to the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines , Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism , and Vera Files , with international presence and networks\n\n, , and , with international presence and networks the existence of the Commission on Human Rights with a proven track record of adherence to the Paris Principles and fundamental tenets of international human rights law, and more specifically, the rights-based approach, with gender, child, ethnic and persons with disability perspectives\n\nwith a proven track record of adherence to the and fundamental tenets of international human rights law, and more specifically, the rights-based approach, with gender, child, ethnic and persons with disability perspectives the existence, though they are in the minority, of progressive state actors in various branches and levels of government, particularly the courts and congress\n\nthe existence of domestic and international human rights organizations, like Amnesty International which has historically documented cases of human rights violations in the Philippines particularly during Marcos’ martial law era\n\nAlthough under siege, and despite high risks to their own life and freedom, these human rights actors unrelentingly engage in various forms of human rights defense, including documentation and evidence-gathering, litigation, advocacy, networking, community organizing, human rights and paralegal training, grassroots capacity-building, and human rights culture-building. It is worth mentioning that, broadly, the human rights community includes torture survivors and freedom fighters from Marcos’ martial law era. They embody and represent the continuum of the human rights community and media’s glorious history and tradition – consecrated in tears and blood – of preserving and fighting for the people’s cherished democratic rights and freedoms.\n\nThe UN Human Rights Council and its special procedures, UN human rights treaty bodies, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and various regional and state actors also play critical roles in exacting accountability for these crimes against humanity. In addition, should they choose to commit to the advancement of their human rights obligations, private corporations – particularly those steeped in environmental and social governance principles and practices – may eventually emerge as another major player.\n\nAnother significant factor is the interconnectedness and real-time communication of our world today.\n\nCritical mass\n\nAll these factors enable human rights actors to cast a spotlight on the government’s lame attempts to hide the impunity with which armed state actors and their so-called “force multipliers” perpetrate their abhorrent “core crimes” under international law. All this helps expose the vicious lies of the government’s propaganda machine, which continued even at the height of the covid-19 pandemic.\n\nHopefully, these human rights forces can help fulfill and realize the ICC’s raison d’être, despite the Marcos-Duterte regime’s persistent attempts to frustrate the ICC mandate to dismantle the wall of impunity. Human rights forces will not capitulate to the government’s legal maneuvers and terror tactics, even as the government has veered toward authoritarianism.\n\nThe convergence of these state, civil society, and international actors inevitably forms a powerful critical mass, provided they mutually, resolutely, and constantly support each other, in a symbiotic way, especially in the face of assaults by enemies of democracy, human rights, and sustainable development.\n\nWe are witnessing in this country, and other parts of the world, the struggle between authoritarian, despotic, and fascist blocs, on the one hand, and democratic, environmental, and human rights forces, on the other.\n\nWith highly perceptive and seasoned ICC prosecutors and judges – particularly ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan – the government’s subterfuge and legal maneuvers will not prevail.\n\nA licensed attorney, Perfecto Caparas serves as a teaching fellow and founding director of the Center for Holistic International Human Rights Law Praxis of the National University of the Union of Myanmar-Burmese American Community Institute.

    "Activists welcome decision to revoke permit for controversial Philippine gold mine": "On Sept. 15, local officials in the southern Philippine municipality of Tampakan revoked the business permit for mining firm Sagittarius Mines, Inc. (SMI), which is seeking to develop a massive copper and gold mine in the area.\n\nLocal officials cited alleged fraud and misrepresentation by the company, noting that it categorized itself as a mineral exploration manufacturer while an assessment found it to be operating as a general engineering contractor.\n\nThe company also recently filed a court petition against the local government, which is seeking to collect 397 million pesos ($6.9 million) in accumulated taxes and surcharges. Local officials deny any link between the tax dispute and the permit revocation.\n\nLocal activists have hailed the revocation of the permit as a victory in a decades-long campaign against the mine.\n\nTAMPAKAN, Philippines — In a move celebrated by anti-mining activists, local officials in the southern Philippine municipality of Tampakan have canceled the business permit for a controversial copper and gold mine, citing alleged fraud and misrepresentation by the operator, Sagittarius Mines, Inc. (SMI).\n\n“The firm does not have a permit anymore from the local government to operate in our jurisdiction. We closed their facility here,” Tampakan Mayor Leonard Escobillo said at a press conference on Sept. 16.\n\nAccording to Escobillo’s order revoking the company’s permit, SMI declared itself a mineral exploration manufacturer in its permit application. But an assessment by the local government found the company to be operating as a general engineering contractor.\n\nIn canceling SMI’s permit, the mayor said he was enforcing the Municipal Tax Code of 2012, which allows local authorities to revoke or deny business permits if the applicant deliberately made false statements in their application.\n\n“There’s nothing personal in this case,” Escobillo told reporters. “We are just doing our obligation, which is to implement our tax ordinance.” According to local officials, the alleged irregularities came to light during a general audit of businesses operating in the municipality.\n\nMongabay sought a comment from SMI but the firm did not respond as of the time this story was published.\n\nWelcome news for activists\n\nLocal activists have hailed the cancellation as a victory in a decades-long fight against SMI’s plans to bring the Tampakan copper and gold mine into production.\n\nTampakan Forum, a coalition of various groups opposing the Tampakan project and spearheaded by the local Catholic Church, expressed jubilation upon learning SMI’s permit was canceled. “The revocation can be considered as another victory towards stopping SMI from operating in the area. We laud the local government unit for this positive move,” said Jerome Millan, director of the Social Action Center of the Diocese of Marbel.\n\nThe Tampakan project is touted as the largest undeveloped copper-gold minefield in Southeast Asia and among the largest of its kind in the world. Based on a company study, the Tampakan project has the potential to yield an average of 375,000 metric tons of copper and 360,000 ounces of gold in concentrate annually throughout the 17-year life of the mine.\n\nThe project area lies within the ancestral domain of the Blaan tribespeople, an estimated 4,000 of whom would be displaced once excavation begins. In addition, anti-mining groups say the project would result in the felling of primary forests and pollution of nearby water sources and irrigation, given its proximity to several major watersheds.\n\n“This is a positive development, especially for the local residents who have been fighting to stop the mining firm from operating in our area,” said Rene Pamplona, a resident of Tampakan municipality and chair of the Alyansa Tigil Mina (Alliance to Stop Mining).\n\nYolanda Esguerra, national coordinator of the Philippine Misereor Partnership, Inc., a network of social development and advocacy groups in the country, called the decision a model for other local officials across the Philippines. “It gives an example for other local government units that they have the power to exercise their authority under the law, to willfully decide on its development direction, protect its people and ecological systems, and assert its governmental autonomy,” she said.\n\nThe notice of revocation of SMI’s permit was served to the company’s offices in Tampakan and in Polomolok, both in South Cotabato province, by the local government on Sept. 15, Escobillo said.\n\nSMI’s core facility, in the village of Liberty, was padlocked as a result of the cancellation of the firm’s business permit, Escobillo said.\n\nThe move came on the heels of a court petition filed by SMI before a local court asking for a review and issuance of a temporary restraining order against the local government’s demand to collect 397 million pesos ($6.9 million) in accumulated taxes and surcharges. The local government was notified of the petition on Sept. 8 and has 30 days to respond.\n\nNena Santos, a lawyer for the Tampakan municipal government, said the revocation of SMI’s permit “has nothing to do” with the tax dispute.\n\nSMI made a false statement in its application for a mayor’s permit, which is why the local government canceled it, with the tax case being an entirely different matter, Santos said at the same press conference\n\n“The company falsely claimed that they are already into manufacturing,” she said, noting the firm has not yet commenced commercial mining operations.\n\nThe mayor said SMI has various avenues for redress under the law and the local ordinance for the lifting of its canceled permit, but did not elaborate.\n\nReversals of fortune\n\nThe revocation of the mayor’s permit is the latest the blows to a mining project that has been mired in controversy since the area’s reserves were confirmed in the 1990s.\n\nThe Tampakan project has been staunchly opposed by the local Catholic Church and environmental groups over concerns for the environment, food security, health, and human rights.\n\nSecurity threats from the communist New People’s Army (NPA) and armed tribesmen also hobbled the Tampakan project. On New Year’s Day 2008, NPA rebels stormed and burned the company’s base camp in the hinterland village of Tablu in Tampakan.\n\nIn 2010, the South Cotabato provincial government imposed a landmark ban on open-pit mining, the method that SMI says is the most viable way to extract the deposits lying near the surface. The ban hampered SMI’s bid to proceed to commercial operation.\n\nThe company has seen some victories as well. In October 2020, the Philippine National Commission on Indigenous Peoples granted the project what’s known as “certification precondition,” confirming that the traditional owners of the project site have consented to the project, and that the company has complied satisfactorily with the process of free, prior and informed consent (FPIC).\n\nWhile anti-mining advocates denounced this development and the process that led to it, there are growing indications that Indigenous resistance to the project, once the backbone of the anti-mining movement, has fractured and faltered.\n\nThen, in May 2022, legislators in South Cotabato lifted the provincial mining ban, removing the decade-old thorn in SMI’s side. However, that reversal of fortune was short-lived: South Cotabato Governor Reynaldo Tamayo Jr. vetoed the measure in June 2022, so the ban on open-pit mining remains in effect across the province.\n\nBanner image: Tampakan government employees close a facility belonging to Sagittarius Mines, Inc. following the revocation of the firm’s permit from the office of the municipal mayor.

    "Typhoon Noru leaves 6 rescuers dead in the northern Philippines": "Updated September 26, 2022 at 5:15 AM ET\n\nMANILA, Philippines — Typhoon Noru blew out of the northern Philippines on Monday, leaving six people dead, knocking down power in two entire provinces, trapping villagers in floods and forcing officials to suspend classes and government work in and around the capital.\n\nThe most powerful typhoon to hit the country this year slammed ashore in Burdeos town in Quezon province before nightfall on Sunday then weakened as it barreled overnight across the main Luzon region, where more than 52,000 people were moved to emergency shelters, some forcibly, officials said.\n\nGov. Daniel Fernando of Bulacan province, north of Manila, said five rescuers, who were using a boat to help residents trapped in floodwaters, were hit by a collapsed wall then apparently drowned in the rampaging waters.\n\n\"They were living heroes who were helping save the lives of our countrymen amid this calamity,\" Fernando told DZMM radio network. \"This is really very sad.\"\n\nPolice said a Bulacan villager drowned after refusing to heed appeals to leave his riverside house. Authorities were separately trying to confirm another death in Burdeos town and a missing farmer in a flooded village in western Zambales province.\n\nIn Aurora province's hard-hit Dingalan town, more than 6,000 houses were damaged and a newly built evacuation center housing more 200 displaced families was battered by the fierce wind and rain but no injuries were reported, officials said.\n\nAbout 3,000 people were evacuated to safety in metropolitan Manila, which was lashed by fierce wind and rain overnight. Classes and government work were suspended Monday in the capital and outlying provinces as a precaution although the morning skies were sunny.\n\nThe entire northern provinces of Aurora and Nueva Ecija, which were hit by the typhoon, remained without power Monday and repair crews were at work to bring back electricity, Energy Secretary Raphael Lotilla told President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in a televised meeting the president called to assess damage and coordinate disaster-response.\n\nAaron Favila / AP / AP Residents give out free food as they wade through a flooded street in their village from Typhoon Noru in San Miguel town, Bulacan province, Philippines on Monday.\n\nMarcos Jr. praised officials for evacuating tens of thousands of people before the typhoon hit, preventing more deaths, but expressed concern at how Noru and another storm that devastated central and southern provinces in December rapidly intensified into super typhoons.\n\n\"Is this climate change?\" Marcos Jr., who took office in June, asked. \"We have kept watched on these storms for a long time but it wasn't like this before... This is something I have to deal with.\"\n\nMarcos Jr. later joined an aerial inspection of typhoon-hit provinces in the rice-growing region, where many villages and stretches of roads remained flooded.\n\nNoru underwent an \"explosive intensification\" over the open Pacific Ocean before it hit the Philippines, Vicente Malano, who heads the country's weather agency, told The Associated Press on Sunday.\n\nFrom sustained winds of 85 kilometers per hour (53 mph) on Saturday, Noru was a super typhoon just 24 hours later with sustained winds of 195 kilometers (121 miles per hour) and gusts of up to 240 kph (149 mph) at its peak late Sunday.\n\nBy Monday noon, Noru had sustained winds of 130 kph (81 mph) and gusts of 160 kph (99 mph) and was moving northwest in the South China Sea toward Vietnam, according to the weather agency.\n\nAbout 20 storms and typhoons batter the Philippines each year. The archipelago also lies in the \"Pacific Ring of Fire,\" a region along most of the Pacific Ocean rim where many volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur, making the Southeast Asian nation one of the world's most disaster-prone.\n\nIn 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones in the world, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million in the central Philippines — well to the south of Noru's path.\n\nCopyright 2022 NPR.
