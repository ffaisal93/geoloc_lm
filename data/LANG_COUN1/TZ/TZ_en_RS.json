    "EU, US question Serbia’s EU commitment after Russia deal": "The European Union and the United States have questioned Serbia’s proclaimed commitment to join Europe’s 27-nation bloc after Belgrade signed an agreement with Moscow pledging long-term “consultations” on foreign policy matters amid Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\nSerbia’s officials signed the deal on Friday in New York with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, where most Western delegations shunned Russia’s top diplomat over the country’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nSerbian Minister of Foreign Affairs Nikola Selakovic signed the document dubbed a “plan on consultations”. He said the plan envisages consultations on bilateral and multilateral activities, though there was nothing on security policies in it. Serbian opposition parties criticised the document.\n\nSerbia’s foreign ministry has sought to downplay the importance of the signed agreement, saying it is a “technical” one and relates to bilateral ties and not security issues.\n\nAlthough Serbia said it supports Ukraine’s territorial integrity, its right-wing government has repeatedly refused to join Western sanctions against Slavic ally Russia. Aligning foreign policies with the EU is one of the main conditions for joining the bloc, but Serbia has increasingly defied calls to do so.\n\nThe news of the deal triggered harsh criticism from both EU and US officials.\n\nEuropean Commission spokesman Peter Stano warned on Monday that Serbia’s relations with Russia cannot be “business as usual” under the current circumstances when Moscow is violating the UN Charter with its armed forces committing atrocities in Ukraine.\n\n“It’s a very clear sign of their intention to strengthen their ties, to further strengthen relations between Serbia and Russia and this is raising serious questions,” he said. “We are taking this very seriously and we are following this up.”\n\nUS Ambassador to Serbia Christopher R Hill said “further alignment with Russia is a step in the wrong direction and contrary to Serbia’s stated European aspirations”.\n\n“The United States believes that no country should be expanding cooperation with Russia while it continues its war of aggression against Ukraine,” Hill said in a statement to The Associated Press news agency.\n\n“News of this agreement signed with Russia was surprising and stands in stark contrast with other constructive meetings in New York with Serbian officials.”\n\nUnder the 10-year rule of Serbian populist leader Aleksandar Vucic, a former ultranationalist, Serbia has been steadily sliding away from its proclaimed EU goals and establishing close political ties with Russia.\n\nIvana Stradner, adviser for the Washington, DC-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said on Twitter that the consultations between Belgrade and Moscow are “one more of Vucic’s balancing game between Washington and Moscow“.\n\n“Did he also tell them about the NATO exercise next week?” Stradner said.",
    "Serbia: Soft fruits in the focus": "A delegation of seven Dutch companies from the soft fruit sector visited Serbia for a three-day visit last week. During the first two days of the visit, several Serbian raspberry, strawberry, and blueberry growers received their Dutch counterparts to walk through their production process and discuss potential improvements with their colleagues from the Netherlands. The visit also highlighted some of the recent developments in Serbian berry production.\n\n\n\nA panel at the Berry Business Forum in Belgrade.

    "UNDP confirms geothermal resource in Belgrade, Serbia": "UNDP confirms geothermal resource in Belgrade, Serbia\n\nThe Houses of Parliament of Serbia, Belgrade (source: flickr/ Ujka Kevin, creative commons)\n\nCarlo Cariaga 26 Sep 2022\n\nA site done by the UNDP together with the Ministry of Mining and Energy has confirmed a geothermal resource on the locations of the SIV 3 and Palace of Serbia buildings in Belgrade.\n\nThe United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in partnership with the Ministry of Mining and Energy in Serbia and in cooperation with the Administration for Joint Services of the Republic Bodies and the Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB) have completed a geothermal resource research on the site of the SIV 3 building in Belgrade, Serbia. A similar study has also began on the location of the Palace of Serbia.\n\nPreliminary results indicate that there is a geothermal resource in both locations with potential to supply power to the two buildings. This will then be followed by a Building Energy Rehabilitation Feasibility Study that will consider the scope, type, and manner of use of the geothermal resource. The planned geothermal resource research will be completed by November 2022.\n\nThese surveys are part of “Energy Efficiency in Central Government Buildings,” a EUR 40-million multi-year programme that aims to improve the energy efficiency in central government buildings. The geothermal resource research conducted at the Palace of Serbia was made possible owing to financial support from the West Balkans Investment Framework (WBIF) and CEB trust funds financed by the Slovak Republic and the Kingdom of Spain, while the same study at the SIV 3 building was financed from grants provided by the Government of the Slovak Republic via the UNDP fund.\n\nThe application of geothermal power to provide for some of the energy needs of SIV 3 and Palace of Serbia buildings would help reduce the buildings’ primary power consumption, cut down CO2 emissions, and enable energy-related savings that can be used to improve working conditions for the staff. It would also address the rising need for introducing newer and cleaner energy sources, and contribute to the green transition of the Serbian economy and society.\n\nSource: UNDP",

    "Serbia: Prospect of EU membership in exchange for giving up Kosovo?": "Long-stalled Serbia–Kosovo dialogue, sponsored by the EU, could be unblocked next year if claims that there is a new EU plan, published in some regional media, are officially confirmed.\n\nTalks on normalising relations between the two countries remain stagnant, and out of the handful of agreements signed, even less have been implemented. Over 11 years of talks, the recognition of Kosovo by Serbia has never been on the table.\n\nKosovo website, Albanian Post, reported that a new plan had been drafted on normalising relations after the engagement of German and French envoys.\n\nAccording to the website, the plan envisages Belgrade accepting, without formally recognising, Kosovo’s independence, getting some financial benefits and the prospect of EU membership in return.\n\nThe same source said that in 10 years when the next batch of EU candidates are likely to join the union, a formal agreement on mutual recognition would be reached and activated before the whole region ascends.\n\nThat would entail recognition of Kosovo’s independence by the five EU countries that have not done so (Greece, Slovakia, Spain, Romania, and Cyprus), while Serbia would get “huge financial aid” and be recognised as the “leading power in the region”.\n\nWhile the plan’s authenticity remains officially unconfirmed, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic recently said he has “read this paper but, knowing what was going to happen, refused to receive it” from the EU special envoy for the dialogue, Miroslav Lajcak, as he visited Belgrade.\n\n“I am experienced enough to know I was not to take that paper.”\n\nDuring a debate on Kosovo in the Serbian parliament, Vucic said that during his term in office, i.e. in the next four and a half years, the former Serbian province that declared independence in 2008 would not be recognised, nor would it join the U.N.\n\nSeveral days later, at the promotion of the youngest generation of Serbian Armed Forces officers in downtown Belgrade, Vucic said that “we will not give Kosovo or any other span of our fatherland to anyone.”\n\n“Those who are threatening Serbia have never understood how great our resolve and determination is to guard what is ours,” said Vucic, without specifying who was threatening Belgrade and why he felt the need to reiterate that it would not relinquish Kosovo.\n\nWhat also piqued public curiosity was that in a patriotic song performed during a break in the programme, the lyric about Kosovo as “the soul of Serbia” was replaced with the line “to all the heroes of Serbia”.\n\nThe song’s author said the Kosovo bit was removed at the request of the Ministry of Defence, which the ministry later denied, saying there were different versions of the same song.\n\nThe plan – a consequence of EU’s more intense engagement\n\nAlbanian Post wrote that the plan is “a new framework” stemming from the direct involvement of French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in the dialogue after the EU leadership apparently concluded that “Kosovo and Serbia will never be able to solve the problem on their own”.\n\nTo soften the blow – as Kosovo remains a highly sensitive issue in Serbia – in the first decade of the agreement’s implementation, Belgrade would not have to recognise it but just accept independence.\n\nThat would be enough for the plan’s authors, given that the issue of Serbia’s accession to the EU will not be on the agenda for some time.\n\nHowever, this would entail Belgrade having to refrain from lobbying for the derecognition of Kosovo’s independence, as well as from opposing Pristina’s accession to international organisations.\n\nThat would enable Kosovo to join the Council of Europe, in the second phase, Interpol and UNESCO, then NATO and the EU, and finally the United Nations.\n\nThat UN membership would apparently be the most problematic because it does not depend solely on Belgrade but also on the position of Russia, as Moscow continues to express readiness to veto any such initiative.\n\nFor its part, Pristina would agree to enable forming the Association of Serb Municipalities at the end of the 10-year period, right before mutual recognition. The association would see the creation of a Serb structure in Kosovo, backed by Belgrade, something Pristina says goes against its constitution and has failed elsewhere, i.e. Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nThe plan allegedly also envisages a precise sequence of events in case Belgrade or Pristina do not accept the document, but those details have not been published.\n\nNo clear confirmation of the document’s authenticity\n\nAlthough nearly all the parties mentioned in the article, aside from Pristina, have commented on the alleged document, its authenticity has never been confirmed or denied.\n\nMedia in Pristina, however, say that Kosovo journalist Baton Haxhiu, known for his close ties with Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama, is behind the article and the website. That is why the document is believed to be authentic.\n\nThe EU has declined to comment on the document, but political pundits have noticed that neither the document’s content nor authenticity has been denied.\n\nThe EU spokesman for foreign affairs and security policy, Peter Stano, has said that as a rule, the EU does not comment on alleged documents published by the media.\n\nAsked about the alleged document, US Ambassador to Serbia Christopher Hill said his country backed the EU in its efforts to achieve a solution in the Belgrade–Pristina dialogue because that problem had been going on for too long and had to be solved.\n\nAnalysts without a clear position on options for implementing the supposed plan\n\nThere is no consensus among political analysts on both sides as to whether the document is authentic but even less so on whether its implementation is feasible, even though they all agree that for the first time in many years, there is a certain readiness in the international community to get the ball rolling.\n\nBelgrade-based political analyst Dusan Janjic believes there are multiple documents in circulation. Vucic said that the West was preparing “a new reinforcement” for Kosovo precisely because he had seen one of those papers.\n\n“The US is insisting on a new format, and this document definitely exists. The timing mentioned in that document completely fits the methodology of operation of the US administration,” said Janjic.\n\nHe said that if the document were not accepted and should the conflict continue, Washington would apply “plan B”, which entailed conflict management and destabilisation controlled by the US, after which Washington would impose a solution on both parties.\n\nFormer Serbian Minister for Kosovo, Slobodan Samardzic, said the published document is not a working platform for a solution but rather a means of ramping up pressure on Belgrade.\n\n“This is pressure based on a paper. This is a new phase on the same subject. There is nothing new, but what will happen if that story continues is new,” said Samardzic.\n\nOn the other hand, Kosovo’s former deputy foreign minister, Valon Murtezaj, believes the plan stands a slim chance of success because of, as he put it, “the destructiveness of Serbia,” which he considers “an unreliable party.”\n\nAccording to him, one should not wait an entire decade for Kosovo’s recognition because Belgrade would use that period to lobby against Kosovo abroad.\n\nFormer Kosovo diplomat Lulzim Peci found some provisions of the supposed plan highly controversial and suspicious, particularly the suggestion that Serbia would be acknowledged as the political and economic leader.\n\n“That terminology does not exist in contemporary legal acts because it entails the legalisation of hegemony and violation of the principle of international law of the equality of states… It looks more like a text for pleasing the sick egos of regional leaders who think they can become masters in others’ homes,” said Peci.\n\nPerhaps the story’s most mysterious segment is Pristina’s behaviour, which has stayed completely silent on the subject. However, Prime Minister Albin Kurti is known as an advocate of Kosovo’s instant recognition as a condition for any talks with Belgrade.\n\nAnalysts believe this might indicate that the international community has sent him a signal that this is a serious plan and that it would not be politically wise for him to reject it even if it does not entirely suit him.\n\n[Edited by Zoran Radosavljevic/Alice Taylor]",

    "ILUS Confirms Its First Investment Project in Serbia": "NEW YORK, NY, Sept. 26, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NewMediaWire -- ILUS International Inc (OTC: ILUS) is a Mergers and Acquisitions company focused on acquiring and growing public safety and industrial companies across the globe. Following decisive meetings with the Development Agency of Serbia and City of Čačak Municipality, the subsidies for the first ILUS investment project in Serbia have been secured and the mobilization plan finalized.\n\n\n\n“Our city is proud to welcome ILUS International for a long-term partnership which is creating thousands of jobs over the next ten years and strengthening the economy in our region. We are pleased that such innovative products will be manufactured in our region by our local people and exported to all parts of the world,” said Mayor of Čačak, Milun Todorovic.\n\nFor its first investment project in Serbia, ILUS has secured upwards of $8 million in government subsidies for ILUS EV Technologies. A further five planned investment projects are included in the company’s approved Phase One business plan for the region, each resulting in their own substantial government subsidies.\n\nAs part of the planned Phase One rollout in Serbia, ILUS has secured a large site on the outskirts of Čačak and also has the option to secure manufacturing facilities in Kragujevac and Jagodina. The planned Phase Two project is considered by ILUS as a separate project entirely, involving the privatization of a large government site.\n\nILUS is now preparing for its machinery and equipment to arrive in Serbia. This will include setting up the production lines for E-Raptor commercial electric utility vehicle manufacturing and OEM manufacturing. Simultaneously, ILUS’ urban mining company, Replay Solutions, will be shipping its plant machinery to Serbia as part of another investment project which will be announced separately. This alone is a substantial undertaking as the list of heavy machinery includes a PCB (Printed Circuit Board) Crusher and Shredder, Electrostatic Separator, Airflow Separator, Pulse Dust Collector, Chemical Refining equipment and Copper Wire Recycling System. Serbia is also expected to be ILUS’ main production hub for vehicles and equipment outside of the United States. The planned investment projects are expected to boost the economy of the region and provide significant revenue for the ILUS subsidiaries, whilst creating employment for hundreds of Serbians over the next three years and thousands over the next five to ten years.\n\n“We are pleased to confirm commencement of our first of several projects in Serbia, whereby we have secured extraordinary benefits to boost our global manufacturing capability. Indeed, further sites are being discussed with the Serbian government and huge contracts are being negotiated for our subsidiaries in Southern and Eastern Europe, such as the Serbian governments need to replace more than 300 firefighting vehicles so that they meet EURO 6 emissions regulations. Our mobilization in Serbia forms part of our greater conglomerate plan to control large scale manufacturing capability in the United States, Europe, and the Middle East,” said ILUS Managing Director, John-Paul Backwell.\n\nThe Serbian city of Čačak is widely regarded as a European innovation hub and was originally chosen by ILUS for its first phase of European production because of its support for manufacturing companies as well as its excellent geographic position with efficient connection to the rest of Europe. Serbia has an attractive automotive and industrial manufacturing industry with highly regarded free zones and government incentives. Many of the world’s largest vehicle brands and automotive industry suppliers have manufacturing facilities in Serbia. Serbia’s low construction, labour, and energy costs compared with other European countries, combined with its pan-European highway network, has led many global conglomerates to have major operations in the country.\n\n“We have formed a favourable and long-term partnership with the Serbian government which gives us the large-scale manufacturing capability that we require for our existing operating companies and for our planned acquisitions which range across the emergency response, defense, and renewable energy sectors. This is only the first project with much larger deals on the horizon in the region. I am proud of what our team has achieved and what this means for the ILUS conglomerate we are building,” said ILUS CEO, Nick Link.\n\nFor further information on the companies please see the ILUS communication channels.\n\nWebsite: https://ilus-group.com\n\nTwitter: ILUS_INTL\n\nEmail: IR@Ilus-Group.com\n\nSource: ILUS\n\nRelated Links\n\nhttps://ilus-group.com\n\nForward-Looking Statement\n\nCertain information set forth in this press release contains \"forward-looking information\", including \"future-oriented financial information\" and \"financial outlook\", under applicable securities laws (collectively referred to herein as forward-looking statements).

    "Serbia's Conservatives Seek Textbook Ban Over 'LGBT Ideology'": "BELGRADE -- Staunch religious and political conservatives have teamed up to challenge Serbia's recently revamped school curriculum over descriptions of gender and sexual identity, sparking a formal review that could result in a textbook ban.\n\nFrom biology to history and sociology, the Serbian Orthodox Church and a fringe right-wing party have demanded the replacement of textbooks they say \"promote LGBT ideology.\"\n\nAs a result, Serbia's education minister is awaiting a recommendation from the National Education Council on the scientific soundness of the materials but also on whether it serves the \"national interest\" to present such ideas to schoolchildren.\n\nEducators and members of Serbia's beleaguered lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community warn that it's part of an accelerating trend of official surrender to the clergy and nationalists seeking to censor and \"dehumanize\" entire segments of the population.\n\nMoreover, they question what \"LGBT ideology\" even means. \"They want to dehumanize us with that phrase,\" Ana Petrovic, a queer woman who lives in Belgrade, told RFE/RL's Balkan Service.\n\n\"It's loud right-wing propaganda that causes us great harm and behind which there's no genuine argument hidden,\" said Petrovic, who works for the Da Se Zna NGO, which provides psychological and legal support to the LGBT community. \"In reality, we are how we are, and we're citizens of this country.\"\n\nOther critics say the textbook challenge is part of a battle to preserve a church-state divide in the face of an \"increasingly extensive clericalization\" that threatens to leave whole generations ill-prepared for life in a rapidly changing world.\n\n'Not Propagated By God'\n\nThe textbook controversy gained steam as Serbian opposition arose this summer to an international parade to express LGBT pride that was scheduled to take place in Belgrade as part of EuroPride week on September 12-18.\n\nOn September 11, with members of his clergy in lockstep with the anti-Pride protests, Serbian Orthodox Patriarch Porfirije appealed publicly for the withdrawal of an eighth-grade biology textbook.\n\nHe said the book, introduced a year earlier under sweeping curricular reforms mandated in 2017, \"imposes an unacceptable LGBT ideology.\" Porfirije said Orthodox Christians \"cannot accept the imposition of new social norms that were not propagated by God.\"\n\nA week later, the leader of a right-wing party rooted in Christianity and nationalism that returned to parliament in April thanks in part to a coalition with monarchists, expanded the complaint, adding seven other textbooks approved by the Education Ministry for primary- and secondary-school students.\n\nDoors party leader Bosko Obradovic cited \"controversial LGBT content\" in five biology textbooks for eighth-graders, an eighth-grade history book, a fourth-grade sociology textbook, and a high-school manual on civic education.\n\nHe alleged that \"the LGBT movement is trying to impose its ideology on the education system, even though that ideology is completely unscientific and unconstitutional.\"\n\nMoreover, Obradovic said, its efforts were targeting students \"in the most sensitive period of maturation.\"\n\nHe requested an urgent session of parliament's Education Committee and pledged to introduce legislation banning \"promotion of homosexual propaganda and transgenderism to minors.\"\n\nOne of the biology textbooks in question explains the difference between sex and gender, and describes sexual orientation and gender identity. Gender \"can be independent of the sex assigned to [a person] at birth,\" the book says, adding, \"An individual alone can determine [their] gender identity.\"\n\nThe history textbook describes LGBT social movements as activists seeking the improvement of the situation for LGBT individuals \"who are often socially exposed to widespread discrimination.\"\n\nWhose 'National Interest'?\n\nEducation Minister Branko Ruzic responded to Porfirije's initiative by citing \"public controversy\" to order a new assessment of the syllabus involving the eighth-grade biology textbook.\n\nHe tasked the National Education Council with evaluating \"whether the program is in accordance with scientific theories\" and \"whether the national interest is reflected in them, and whether this is in the best interest of education\" for Serbia's children.\n\nThe council is currently seeking expert opinion ahead of an extraordinary session to agree on nonbinding conclusions for the minister.\n\nRuzic unfortunately \"succumbed to the influence of those who should not question the curriculum, especially when it comes to natural, exact sciences that are based on data and research,\" Biljana Stojkovic, a professor of biology at the University of Belgrade who participated in the development of the new biology curriculum, told RFE/RL's Balkan Service.\n\nShe says the syllabus sticks to facts and that \"national interest\" has no place in scientific education since there's no \"Serbian biology, physics, or chemistry.\"\n\nStojkovic, who was a presidential candidate for a green coalition in this year's presidential election won by incumbent Aleksandar Vucic and has publicly opposed religion in public education, says she regards the attacks on the syllabus as \"censorship.\"\n\nForcing biology teachers \"not to talk about what scientific knowledge is...will be met with great resistance from the biological profession,\" she said.\n\nSerbia's 2018 law on textbooks prescribes that textbook publishers present a curriculum adopted by the education minister. The curriculum is recommended by the National Education Council based on a proposal from the Institute for the Improvement of Education, which operates under the ministry.\n\nThe curriculums and textbooks currently under attack by conservatives were introduced ahead of the 2021-22 academic year.\n\nThe Education Ministry declined to respond to RFE/RL queries on the textbook issue.\n\nThe Institute for the Improvement of Education told RFE/RL's Balkan Service that the curriculum it proposed in 2019 was in line with accepted theories and facts, as well as with the legislatively mandated goals of education. There were no problems in the approval process for the related textbooks and the biology textbook in question has been in use for a year, the institute added.\n\n\"It wasn't done 'overnight,' it was a team of experts\" who created the curriculum, Stojkovic said. \"Schoolteachers were involved, too. The plan and program were fundamentally changed with the aim of modernizing them so you can apply the knowledge from biology in understanding the world around you.\"\n\nShe blamed the current criticisms on \"retrograde structures whose goal is to hide this scientific knowledge\" and \"deny children the knowledge that certain minority groups exist in our society at all.\"\n\nBowing to the calls for banning the textbooks would be tantamount to \"the capitulation of the state to increasingly strong clerical and nationalist currents,\" she said.\n\n'Used To It Since We Were Little'\n\nCritics, including the European Parliament, earlier this year expressed alarm over perceived Serbian concessions to Orthodox Church efforts emanating from Moscow to portray Russia as a guardian of traditional family values in the Balkans, thus strengthening ties there as Moscow faces increased isolation over its ongoing invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn a resolution warning of \"foreign interference\" in EU democratic processes in March, European lawmakers expressed concern about alleged \"attempts by the Orthodox Church in countries such as Serbia, Montenegro, and Bosnia-Herzegovina, especially in its entity Republika Srpska, to promote Russia as a protector of traditional family values and fortify relations between state and church.\"\n\nAround 85 percent of Serbia's population described itself as Christian Orthodox in the country's last census, in 2011.\n\nPresident Vucic has done little to discourage the Serbian Orthodox Church's frequent forays into politics at home and in neighboring Montenegro and Bosnia. He has maintained close ties to Moscow and endorsed a \"Slavic brotherhood\" uniting Russians and Serbs throughout the region.\n\nIn an online Appeal For A Secular State, published on September 19, 200 prominent Serbs called for official pushback against an \"increasingly extensive clericalization of the state.\"\n\nOrganized by longtime opposition leader Zoran Vuletic and his liberal Civic Democratic Forum (GDF) party, it blames the imposition of religious notions in education for the spread of \"denial of science, conspiracy theories, and mythomania\" that risks \"raising whole generations in the spirit of the most conservative obscurantism, unable to live in the modern world and keep pace with their surroundings.\"\n\nThere are also fears that a Serbian ban on the teaching of issues around sexual orientation, gender identity, and LGBT activism could foreshadow prohibitions on gay \"propaganda\" like those introduced in Russia nearly a decade ago and in Hungary last year.

    "Kosovo-Serbia Tensions Are Reminder of Fragile Security, Unresolved Issues": "An agreement between Serbia and Kosovo, mediated over the weekend by the European Union and the U.S., settled a dispute over identity documents, but tensions over the matter, as well as license plates for ethnic Serbs in the north of Kosovo, are a reminder of the fragile stability in the region.\n\nCitizens can now move freely between the countries with their national ID cards. Until now, Kosovo citizens were given temporary Serbian documents when traveling to Serbia. In the latest deal, Kosovo agreed not to introduce entry/exit documents for Serbian ID holders.\n\nThe European Union's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, hailed the agreement.\n\n\"This is a European solution. We congratulate both leaders on this decision & their leadership,\" he said on Twitter.\n\n\"The United States supports this agreement and sees it as an important step forward towards normalized relations, centered on mutual recognition,\" a State Department spokesperson told VOA on Monday.\n\nBut analysts say it is precisely Serbia’s refusal to recognize the sovereignty of its former province that lies at the crux of the problems between the countries.\n\nDavid Kanin, adjunct professor of international relations at Johns Hopkins University and a former CIA senior analyst, told VOA, \"There's only one problem between Serbia and Kosovo, and that is the status of Kosovo.\" He said that problems such as ID cards and license plates are \"simply part of that issue.\"\n\nFrank Wisner, a retired U.S. ambassador who served as the U.S. special envoy to U.N.-backed talks between the countries, told VOA that the U.S. is steadfast in its support for Kosovo's independence from Serbia, which it declared in 2008.\n\n\"The United States has been foursquare behind Kosovo in consolidating that independence and achieving the widest possible recognition, but most particularly recognition by Serbia. That has not happened,\" he said, adding that it is not likely to happen soon.\n\nKosovo sees the latest agreement as one step on the road to mutual recognition, with Prime Minister Albin Kurti saying full reciprocity on other issues will be imposed, if an agreement to that end is not reached.\n\n\"We want there to be normalization to be achieved through an internationally and legally binding agreement for the complete normalization of relations with mutual recognition at the center,\" he said one day after the deal on ID cards was achieved.\n\nBut Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said that allowing border crossing with Kosovo ID cards is done for practical reasons and \"cannot be interpreted as recognition of Kosovo's independence.\"\n\nThe European Union is leading the dialogue between the countries. Five of its own members do not recognize Kosovo, and Kanin says that that puts Serbia in a comfortable position.\n\n\"On the Kosovo side, on the other hand, they can't do anything to force through their sovereignty because the context in which they are operating prevents their sovereignty from being universally recognized, because that context includes five members of the EU who do not recognize Kosovo as a country,\" he said.\n\nThe European Union has told both countries their EU aspirations hinge on normalizing relations.\n\nRoadblocks in Kosovo\n\nThe latest round of high-level diplomacy followed tensions in late July in a part of northern Kosovo where ethnic Serbs are in the majority, after Kosovo's government announced it would begin requiring Serbian document holders entering Kosovo to obtain temporary Kosovo-issued IDs, just as Kosovo citizens entering Serbia have had to do for over a decade.\n\nKosovo also said it would begin requiring ethnic Serbs living in Kosovo to use Kosovo license plates for their cars, instead of Serbian ones. Some local Serbs responded by blocking roads, prompting NATO to warn against escalation.\n\n\"Should stability be jeopardized KFOR stands ready to intervene and will take any measures that are necessary to ensure a safe and secure environment and freedom of movement for all the people of Kosovo,\" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said, referring to the 3,770-troop peacekeeping force in Kosovo.\n\nRoads were opened after Kurti agreed to postpone implementation of the plan for ID cards and license plates until September 1, but the flare-up was a reminder that security is fragile in a region where old disagreements are not settled and memories of the 1998-99 Kosovo war remain fresh. Kosovo still plans to implement the license plate requirement on September 1.\n\nBetween EU and Moscow\n\nSince the July flare-up, Moscow has repeatedly expressed its support for Serbia. The countries have historical ties. Serbia – like Kosovo and other Western Balkans countries – aspires to become an EU member, but unlike them it has not imposed sanctions on Russia.\n\nLast week its minister of interior, Alexandar Vulin, met in Moscow with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Referring to Western sanctions, Vulin said Belgrade \"will never engage in anti-Russian hysteria.\"\n\n“Serbia is the only state in Europe that didn’t introduce sanctions and was not part of the anti-Russian hysteria,” he told Lavrov.\n\nSerbia, however, has joined the U.N. resolution condemning Russia's invasion. In a Reuters interview on Monday, Vucic said that his country is the stage for a proxy war between East and West.\n\n\"You have a proxy war of big powers going on in Serbia through political players, the nongovernmental sector on both sides, the media and various social organizations, and you can see it every day, in every way,\" he said, speaking to Reuters at his office in Belgrade.\n\nKanin says Vucic is comfortable sitting on two stools.\n\n\"Serbia is not going along with Western policy in total,\" he said. \"They've gone along with certain things, [such as] the U.N. vote. There have been certain areas in which Vucic has leaned toward the Western stool. In certain situations, he leans toward the Russian stool.\"\n\nNext steps\n\nThere is no agreement yet on the license plates for local Serbs in Kosovo's North, and on Wednesday, Serbia's Vucic said he does not believe that a solution is possible.\n\n\"From September 1, [Kosovo] will ... try to force Serbs to change car plates, and I don't think they will have a big success\" Vucic told reporters.\n\nHowever, Major General Ferenc Kajari, the commander of NATO's peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, sought to dispel fears about a conflict. \"We are monitoring the situation ... and we don’t see even an indication of any preparation for a war,\" he told Reuters.\n\nThe U.S. envoy for the Western Balkans, Gabriel Escobar, has called on the parties to continue the dialogue and to implement all the agreements that they have agreed on, including one on a Community of Serb Municipalities in the North of Kosovo. Kurti is against such a monoethnic body with executive powers within the country.\n\nWhether one believes that incremental progress will ultimately yield mutual recognition or that agreements on practical matters are beneficial for their own sake, Kosovo and Serbia are bound to face their disagreements.\n\nWisner said full resolution is the ultimate goal, \"but you can only get there step by step.\"\n\n“It also falls to the two governments in Belgrade and Pristina to find steps short of a full resolution that will bring good sense to the region and allow practical solutions to practical problems and give time a chance to make a difference on the overall question of recognition.”\n\nBesim Abazi and Milan Nesic contributed to this report.

    "Serbian president questions double standards over territorial integrity": "Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic on Wednesday questioned double standards practiced by certain countries over the territorial integrity and sovereignty of states.\n\n\n\nNonuse of force and the peaceful resolution of disputes are the pillars of world stability. But they must be accompanied by principles such as nonselective observance of the UN Charter, implementation of mandatory UN Security Council resolutions and the basic principles of the applicable international law, he told the General Debate of the 77th session of the UN General Assembly.\n\n\n\nSerbia did not violate the territorial integrity of a single sovereign state. Yet, the fact did not prevent NATO from attacking Serbia without a decision by the UN Security Council, Vucic said.\n\n\n\nSecurity Council Resolution 1244, which confirmed and guaranteed partial sovereignty and full territorial integrity of Serbia, did not prevent many Western countries from unilaterally recognizing the independence of Kosovo, and from violating the territorial integrity of Serbia, he said.\n\n\n\nRegardless of the fact that Serbia still feels the consequences of the gross violation of the basic provisions of international law, Serbia does not give up on the foundational principles of the UN, said Vucic.\n\n\n\n\"We shall keep advocating the consistent observance of the principle of inviolability of borders, respect for sovereignty and integrity of all other UN member states,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"Despite such a position of ours, many in this room have issues with respecting the territorial integrity of Serbia. You wonder why? Because they have the power in their hands, and in their eyes, we are small and weak.\"\n\n\n\nSerbia believes that it is imperative that current challenges must not deepen world divisions in any way, and that polarization at the global level should make room for principles of multilateralism, he said.\n\n\n\nSerbia strongly supports inclusive, networked and efficient multilateralism as the best tool for responding to the most urgent challenges facing mankind, he said. \"Multilateralism, collective actions and common responsibility are ­irreplaceable elements of our discussions so far. But allow me to underline that the starting point for such constructive engagement is solidarity,\" Vucic said.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "Air Serbia Seeks Additional US Destinations": "Air Serbia hopes to expand in the United States by serving new destinations and agreeing to a new codeshare agreement.\n\nNext year, Air Serbia is planning to inaugurate service to Chicago, but it is already eyeing additional destinations in the United States.\n\nGet the latest aviation news straight to your inbox: Sign up for our newsletters today.\n\nAmerican expansion\n\nAir Serbia's CEO Jiri Marek shared some insight into the airlines' expansion plans to the United States with Aero Telegraph,\n\n“We’re looking at other destinations in the US. But again, our main strategy is to target cities that have year-round potential. We do not want to increase seasonality, which is already high in our region. That's one of the reasons we favour Chicago over Toronto, for example, because the Canadian city is not only extremely seasonal, but also extremely unidirectional. At the beginning of the season the flights are full in one direction, and at the end of the season in the other direction.\"\n\nThe busiest unserved United States routes from Belgrade, excluding Chicago, are Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Las Vegas, Denver, Phoenix, Detroit, Atlanta, Boston, Washington, Tampa, Houston, and Orlando.\n\nAir Serbia owes a lot of its success to the Serbian government which subsidizes and owns much of the airline. Photo: Air Serbia\n\nThe Serbian carrier already plans to have daily service to New York next summer in addition to two weekly frequencies to Chicago and hopes to agree to a codeshare with a major United States airline. Air Serbia has previously attempted to form a codeshare agreement with American carriers but was unsuccessful.\n\n“We currently have interline agreements that work quite well. But we are working on reaching the next level, which is codeshare cooperation with one of the major airlines in the United States. We are in the final stages of negotiations and believe we can announce this before the end of the year.” - Marek\n\nRecent Air Serbia news\n\nEarly this week, Air Serbia announced that it was counting on 2022 to be a profitable year. Newly appointed CEO Jiri Marek said,\n\n“We are a smaller regional airline and want to grow with the market in a profitable and sustainable way. In 2021 we significantly improved our operational performance and even reduced our loss. This year we are aiming to be profitable, and we will continue to be on that path in the future as well. We want it to stay like that. Air Serbia will continue to be the leading regional carrier in the Balkan region, and we would like to keep our market share between 50 to 55 percent in Belgrade.”\n\nBefore 2020, Air Serbia recorded profits every year from 2014-2020. But had it not been for government subsidies, Air Serbia would have suffered significant losses. The value of the airline's subsidies is unknown, as well as the subsidies offered by the government to over 50 organizations.\n\nEtihad used to have an ownership stake in Air Serbia, but it recently withdrew. Photo: Air Serbia\n\nLess than two years ago, Air Serbia received a capital injection of $100 million, but how the money was used is unknown. The injection increased the Government’s stake in the airline from 51% to 82%, which happened as Etihad withdrew from Air Serbia. As the Serbian government and Air Serbia are tightly linked, Air Serbia has been able to grow significantly. Marek added,\n\n“Air Serbia played a significant role during the pandemic, helping the Serbian government with repatriation flights, with delivering medical aid and so on. And I think we proved that not only connectivity but also significant economic benefits are a result of our operation.”\n\nThe Serbian airline hopes that this year’s return to profit will begin a trend of long-term profitability.\n\nDo you think that Air Serbia will be able to reach a codeshare with an American carrier anytime soon? If so, which one? Let us know in the comments below.\n\nSource: aerotelegraph.com",
    "Serbia added to human rights watch list over Europride, freedom of assembly": "Serbia was added on Thursday to the CIVICUS Monitor’s International Human Rights Watch List with the rating of ‘obstructed’ due to the prohibition of EuroPride by the police with the backing of President Aleksander Vucic and other human rights violations.\n\nThe EuroPride march, which was banned by the authorities despite pleas from the EU, MEPs and international organisations, went ahead but resulted in the assault and hospitalisation of some LGBTI protestors and the arrest of tens of right-wing counter-protesters.\n\nNotable were discriminatory comments from politicians and figures from the Orthodox Church during the run-up to the event, as were counterprotests brandishing placards of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s face.\n\nThousands march in Belgrade against EuroPride Thousands of religious and right-wing activists marched through Serbia’s capital on Sunday, calling for authorities to ban EuroPride, which is scheduled for next weekend despite being cancelled by the government.\n\n“This ban is a continuation of the practice of banning peaceful assemblies because of violent counter-assemblies. All persons who called for or committed violence before and during EuroPride must be held responsible for their actions. This would be a starting point for authorities to show that they are fully committed to protecting the right to peaceful assembly and battling discrimination against the LGBTQI+ community,” said Uroš Jovanović, from the Gradjanske inicijative.\n\nCIVICUS, a group of over 10,000 international civil society organisations who publish their watchlist every quarter, highlighted Serbia due to attacks on LGBTI activists and journalists at the EuroPride march, protests on environmental issues have faced restrictions, and ecological defenders face judicial harassment through SLAPPs.\n\nActivists condemn right-wing violence at Belgrade EuroPride Almost ninety people were arrested by police while activists reported assaults from those countering the EuroPride march which saw over 10,000 people march despite a police ban with government backing. Thousands of activists took to the streets in the Serbian capital …\n\nThe organisation details several examples of attacks on the LGBTI community, including 15 in three years on a local centre with not a single arrest.\n\nTheir statement continues that the country is an example where “there have been significant increases in attacks against the right to free speech, the right to protest and the right to freedom of association. It is joined on the watchlist by Guatemala, Sri Lanka, Guinea and Zimbabwe.\n\nThere are 42 countries in the world with the obstructed rating. This rating is typically given to countries where civic space is heavily contested by power holders, who impose a combination of legal and practical constraints on the full enjoyment of fundamental rights.\n\n“Respect for civic freedoms is a key requirement for Serbia’s accession to the European Union. If the Serbian government is serious about joining the EU, it must urgently commit to respecting civic freedoms and halt all attacks on LGBTQI+ rights, journalists, environmental defenders and civil society. In addition, the EU must closely monitor developments on civic freedoms in the country, said Aarti Narsee, Civic Space Researcher Europe, CIVICUS.",

    "Serbia: Authorities must repeal “shameful” ban on Euro Pride walk": "Ahead of tomorrow’s planned Euro Pride walk in Belgrade which has been banned by Serbian authorities, Eve Geddie, Amnesty International’s Director at the European Institutions Office said:\n\n\n\n“The decision by Serbian authorities to ban Euro Pride for purported security reasons is shameful. Instead of giving in to hateful rhetoric towards and threats against LGBTI people, authorities must take all necessary measures to provide adequate protection for the participants and enable them to enjoy their rights without fear of harassment, intimidation or violence.\n\n\n\n“By allowing the walk to proceed, Serbia will cement its place as the first country in the Western Balkans to host Euro Pride in a region where LGBTI people experience daily discrimination and frequent violence. The authorities should lift the ban and allow the Euro Pride walk to go ahead unhindered.”\n\n\n\nBackground\n\n\n\nIn 2020, Belgrade nominated itself to host the Euro Pride. However, in August 2022, President Aleksandar Vučić, announced that the Pride walk would not be allowed to proceed. Organizers have said that the walk will take place despite the ban.\n\n\n\nOn 10 September, President Vučić said that the Ministry of Interior would make a decision 96 hours before the planned event.\n\n\n\nOn 13 September, the Ministry of Interior decided that neither the Pride walk, nor a planned counterprotest, could go ahead citing security issues, including “danger of violence, destruction of property, and other forms of disruption of public order on a larger scale”.\n\n\n\nOn 14 September, the organizers filed a complaint to the Administrative Court requesting it to overturn the Ministry’s decision. This is still pending.\n\n\n\nEarlier today, organizers submitted another formal request to the Ministry of Interior with a proposed shorter route for the walk.

    "Proxy war between East and West in Serbia, President Vucic says": "Serbia wants to join the European Union while keeping strong relations with its gas supplier Russia and key investor China.\n\nThe East and West are engaged in a proxy war in Serbia, President Aleksandar Vucic has said, as Belgrade seeks to maintain its ambition to join the EU while keeping its relations with Russia and China.\n\nVucic’s remarks on Monday come a day after protesters at a rally in Belgrade against a gay pride march waved Russian flags and carried posters of Russia’s President Vladimir Putin.\n\n“I cannot say that it [the protest] was a proxy attack because there were many ordinary people there … But whether there is a proxy conflict in Serbia … there is one, no doubt about that, East and West,” he said.\n\nSerbia has been a candidate to join its single-biggest trade partner and investor, the European Union, since 2012. It is militarily neutral but maintains ties with NATO and has purchased weapons from its member states.\n\nHowever, the Balkan nation is almost entirely dependent on Russian gas and has also bought weapons from Russia. China is a key investor, mainly in mining and infrastructure.\n\nAlthough Serbia condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine at the United Nations, it refused to join sanctions against Moscow. Beijing and Moscow support Serbia’s opposition to the independence of Kosovo, Belgrade’s former southern province, over which it fought a 1998-99 war.\n\n“We are trying to survive … with as few wounds and scars as possible,” said Vucic, a former nationalist who later embraced pro-European policies.\n\nKosovo-Serbia tensions\n\nBefore Serbia joins the EU, it must mend ties with Kosovo, which declared its independence from Serbia in 2008.\n\nEU-sponsored talks have been slow and often marred by tensions, the latest of which erupted this summer over the issue of car number plates and identity documents for minority Serbs, mainly living in Kosovo’s north.\n\nIndependent Kosovo is recognised by the United States and all but five EU members but not by Belgrade and other states, including Serbia’s allies Russia and China.\n\nAlthough Serbia and Kosovo agreed to settle the dispute over identification documents, authorities in Pristina said local Serbs must switch their car number plates from Serbian to Kosovo ones within two months of September 1.\n\n‘Anti-Russian hysteria’\n\nVucic said he did not believe authorities in Pristina wanted “a serious conversation or a serious dialogue”, but they believed they could impose their plans with support from the West.\n\n“I trust that those countries which are … protecting the so-called independence of Kosovo … will convince the Pristina regime not to play [with] a conflict in the region, which is certainly full of problems,” he said.\n\nThe Serbian president said more talks and shuttle diplomacy by EU and US envoys aimed at resolving the car number plates issue are expected in the coming weeks.\n\nLast week, Serbia’s Interior Minister Aleksandar Vulin met Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow, highlighting Belgrade’s refusal to join Western sanctions against Russia over its war in Ukraine.\n\nLavrov during their meeting said, “Serbia is the only state in Europe that didn’t introduce sanctions and was not part of the anti-Russian hysteria”.",
    "Serbian PM says willing to compromise during first Kosovo visit": "Compromise needed for ‘normalisation of ties between Belgrade and Pristina’, Ana Brnabic says.\n\nSerbia’s Ana Brnabic has expressed willingness to compromise during her first visit to Kosovo since becoming prime minister almost five years ago, a day after Germany and France appealed to Serbia and Kosovo to resolve a flare-up in tension.\n\nUnrest among Serbs in northern Kosovo over demands for them to use Kosovo documents has raised fears of conflict between the two countries, more than two decades after NATO bombed Serbia to end repression of Kosovo’s Albanian majority.\n\nSerbia does not recognise Kosovo’s independence and about 3,700 NATO peacekeepers still patrol to prevent violence between the Albanian and Serb communities.\n\nDozens of US-NATO troops stepped up patrols in northern Kosovo at the start of the month to preserve calm after the government in Pristina set a two-month deadline for Serbs in the area, which borders Serbia, to switch to Kosovo licence plates.\n\nEarlier attempts to introduce Kosovo licence plates in Serb-dominated northern Kosovo led to clashes between police and local Serbs, who erected roadblocks. The barricades were dismantled only when NATO peacekeepers stepped in to oversee the process and Kosovo agreed to postpone the licensing demand.\n\nDuring her first visit to Kosovo since she took over as prime minister in 2017, Brnabic said: “Compromise in the interest of peace and stability – definitely yes.”\n\nIn the ethnically divided city of Mitrovica, about 1,000 local Serbs greeted Brnabic, waving Serbian flags and holding signs that read “We have only one prime minister” and “Welcome to Serbia, holy land of Kosovo”.\n\n“I sincerely hope that the temporary institutions in Pristina become genuinely committed to dialogue and finding a certain compromise needed for long-term normalisation of ties between Belgrade and Pristina,” said Brnabic during a news conference, referring to Kosovo authorities.\n\n“That is something we need – not just for our European integration – but for ourselves,” she said.\n\nSerbia has been a candidate to join the European Union since 2012. However, most experts doubt the country stands a chance of entering the bloc until Belgrade hammers out a deal to normalise ties with Kosovo.\n\nBrnabic’s delegation travelled with a heavy security detail, while NATO troops were stationed along the main roads in the area and a helicopter circled overhead.\n\nDuring her one-day Kosovo tour, the 46-year-old was set to visit educational facilities, a Serbian Orthodox monastery, and chat with local farmers.\n\nIn another show of willingness to mend relations, Kosovo ministers visited areas in southern Serbia where Albanians are in the majority.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron, wrote to Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti on Sunday saying normal ties between Kosovo and Serbia are “of crucial importance” to the region.\n\n“Recent tensions have shown that constructive steps forward are urgently needed, both on the practical and the political level,” Scholz and Macron wrote in the letter, which was published by both Vucic’s and Kurti’s offices.\n\nTalks between Kosovo and Serbia under the auspices of the EU and US envoys have so far failed to solve the licence plates issue, although Belgrade and Pristina reached a deal on the use of personal identity documents.\n\nSerbs account for 5 percent of the 1.8 million people in Kosovo and Serbia accuses Kosovo of trampling on their rights, a charge denied by Pristina.\n\nKosovo is recognised by some 100 countries, including the United States and all but five EU members, but not by a number of other states, notably Russia and China.",

The Serbs’ last three matches in the knockout phase were all thrillers, they ousted Italy in a shootout in the quarters, beat Hungary again with penalties in the semis, then nailed against Spain, scoring the winner two minutes from time.\n\nIn the final, Spain took the lead and Serbs needed almost six minutes to score their first but then added one more to go ahead 2-1 after eight minutes. Soon they doubled the gap and still held on for 4-2 deep into the third but the Spaniards levelled the score in 47 seconds while the Serbs’ captain Vasilije Martinovic got his second exclusion. Still, his team-mates didn’t panic, and Nikola Kojic netted an action goal in the very last second of the first half for 5-4.\n\nAgain, the Serbs managed to reset the two-goal difference twice, however, Spain could come back to even again, two man-up goals in two minutes were enough to make it 7-7, while the Serbs missed two extras still in this period.\n\nNot in the fourth, though, Aleksandar Kovacevic put away a 6 on 5 after a minute, however, despite missing their next man-up, Spain could equalise, Gerard Gil sent the ball home from action for 8-8. With 5:23 to go, Serbia took a time-out, but the man-up play didn’t work; still, a save also denied the Spaniards in their extra. A bit later, with 3:24 on the clock, the Serbian head coach Uros Stevanovic got a red card (not for the first time in his career, though his impulsiveness is definitely one of the keys to his teams’ successes) – that just boosted his players’ morale who killed back-to-back man-downs and then Martinovic, still in the water, sent a brilliant bouncer from the wing under the bar in an extra, with 2:03 on the clock for 9-8.\n\n𝗟𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝗻𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 🤩🇷🇸 The future of Serbian Water Polo 👏 #ecwppodgorica2022 pic.twitter.com/hUzw4lz6kv — LEN – European Aquatics (@LENaquatics) September 26, 2022\n\nIt was Spain’s turn, but even after a time-out they were unable to overplay the super-intensive defence of the Serbs and the goalie could make an easy catch to deny them in the fourth straight man-down. The Spaniards had one more possession, managed to launch a counter-like attack but the finish was poor from the left side, and together with the ball their chances also flew away.\n\nThe Serbs kept the ball in the last half a minute and could start the big celebrations together with many supporters coming over to the neighbourhood – they claimed their 4th title (as Serbia), while Spain had to settle for the silver medal for the 6th time.\n\n𝗦𝗲𝗿𝗯𝗶𝗮 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗱𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗶𝘁! 🔥 🇷🇸 Serbia win #ecwppodgorica2022 gold after victory over Spain! pic.twitter.com/saQ4LkqjI0 — LEN – European Aquatics (@LENaquatics) September 25, 2022\n\nIn the bronze medal match, Hungary earned some consolation with a hard-fought win over Greece.

    "Serbia: Rescind Pride Ban, Guarantee Participant Protection": "Click to expand Image Participants attend the Euro Pride 2019 gay pride parade in Vienna, Austria on June 15, 2019. © JOE KLAMAR/AFP via Getty Images\n\nUpdate: On September 17, EuroPride 2022 went ahead, after EuroPride organizers notified authorities of a new route and received guarantees from the Prime Minister on Saturday morning that the March could go ahead safely. More than 5,000 police and military officers were deployed across Belgrade and 64 counter-protestors were arrested, according to Serbian authorities. At least seven LGBT people were attacked after the march, which victims reported to police. Thousands of participants walked from the Constitutional Court in Belgrade to a nearby park, along a much shorter route than originally planned. They were joined by the Council of Europe Human Rights Commissioner, Dunja Mijatović, the European Commissioner for Equality, Helena Dalli, Members of the European Parliament, and dozens of diplomats as well as other European and international leaders, marching in solidarity and in support of the rights to freedom of assembly and expression.\n\n(Berlin) – The Serbian government should immediately rescind its ban on EuroPride events scheduled for Belgrade in September 2022, Human Rights Watch said today. Instead, the authorities should work with organizers to ensure adequate safety for participants.\n\nOn August 27, President Aleksandar Vucic announced that the government is cancelling EuroPride, a regional event promoting equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people that Serbia was poised to host from September 12 to 18, with a march on September 17. Vucic acknowledged that the move is a “violation of minority rights,” but justified his decision because of threats from right wing groups to disrupt the event and rising border tensions with Kosovo. Prime Minister Ana Brnabic, a lesbian who is the first woman to hold the position, supported the cancellation, saying, “the first inviolable thing is to ensure peace and stability in the country.”\n\n“The Serbian government’s decision to cancel EuroPride is a shameful surrender to, and implicit sanctioning of, bigotry and threats of unlawful violence,” said Graeme Reid, director of the LGBT rights program at Human Rights Watch. “Street protests by far-right groups and religious entities have already taken place. Now Serbia has an obligation to also ensure the safety and dignity of EuroPride participants.”\n\nThe government announcement followed a demonstration by thousands of people on August 27 in Belgrade opposing the Europride events, with slogans such as, “save our children and our family.”\n\nOrganizers have indicated that they have not received formal notification of a ban and intend to hold the event as planned. “President Vucic cannot cancel someone else’s event,” said Kristine Garina, president of the European Pride Organizers Association. “EuroPride is not cancelled, and will not be cancelled. During the bidding process for EuroPride 2022, Prime Minister Brnabic promised the full support of the Serbian government … and we expect that promise to be honored,”\n\nThe co-chair of the European Parliament’s LGBTI InterGroup has indicated that she will attend regardless of Vucic’s cancellation. Serbian civil society groups indicated at the end of August that they plan to appeal any ban in court. Vucic has responded to criticism by saying, without sharing details, that the government will enforce the ban: “If a gathering is banned, then it will be banned. There will be no games with state decisions.”\n\nThe Serbian government, after banning Pride events between 2011 and 2013, has allowed parades in Belgrade since 2014, which have been peaceful. Serbian authorities’ justification for cancelling EuroPride 2022 bears a striking resemblance to Russia’s arguments, for banning marches by LGBT people on grounds that they could lead to violent clashes with counterdemonstrators. The European Court of Human Rights struck down that argument in Alekseyev v. Russia in 2010 as a violation of the right to peaceful assembly.\n\nIn rejecting the Russian government's argument, the court reiterated that there is “no ambiguity” about “the right of individuals to openly identify themselves as gay, lesbian or any other sexual minority, and to promote their rights and freedoms, in particular by exercising their freedom of peaceful assembly.” The court emphasized that by refusing LGBT rights activists the right to peaceful assembly, “the authorities effectively endorsed the intentions of persons and organizations that clearly and deliberately intended to disrupt a peaceful demonstration in breach of the law and public order.”\n\nRather than banning demonstrations because third parties threaten public order, the authorities should be fulfilling their duty to ensure that police protect peaceful demonstrators exercising their right to freedom of assembly, Human Rights Watch said. Based on human rights jurisprudence regarding pride marches, law enforcement authorities should remember they are there to protect those participating in the event.\n\nAs a member of the Council of Europe, Serbia should adhere to the Council’s standards to combat discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity, including that member states should ensure everyone’s freedom of peaceful assembly without any discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity. The Council of Europe standards also say governments should not misuse legal and administrative provisions to impose restrictions on freedom of expression and peaceful assembly on grounds of public health, public morality, and public order.\n\nArticle 21 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Serbia ratified in 2001, explicitly protects the right to peaceful assembly. In a 2016 report, the UN special rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association specified that, “The State’s failure to protect participants in a peaceful rally against violent, fundamentalist counter-protesters, for example, constitutes a violation of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly.” The special rapporteur said that the government “has a positive duty to protect those exercising their right to peaceful assembly, even if they are promoting unpopular positions (e.g., rights for LGBTI persons or those of a minority religion).”\n\nIn a 2022 report, the rapporteur emphasized that “Protests have been particularly important in facilitating participation of otherwise excluded groups such as … LGBTQI+ persons and other marginalized communities and victims’ groups … Where States adopt securitized, hostile approaches to protests, rather than welcoming them as an important part of democratic life, the result is often to deepen underlying crises.”\n\n“Instead of opportunistically pandering to anti-rights groups, Serbian authorities should work with EuroPride organizers to make the event safe and guarantee the right to peaceful assembly,” Reid said. “Threats against LGBT people’s dignity and rights should receive a serious reaction from the government. Cancelling a regional event is the wrong move.”",
    "EU, US Question Serbia’s EU Commitment After Russia Deal": "By: Associated Press\n\n-\n\nThe European Union and the U.S. on Monday questioned Serbia’s proclaimed commitment to join Europe’s 27-nation bloc after Belgrade signed an agreement with Moscow pledging long-term “consultations” on foreign policy matters amid Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\nSerbia’s officials signed the deal last week in New York with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, where most Western delegations shunned Russia’s top diplomat over the country’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nUnder the 10-year rule of Serbian populist President Aleksandar Vucic, a former ultranationalist, Serbia has been steadily sliding away from its proclaimed EU goals and establishing close political ties with Russia.\n\nSerbia’s foreign ministry has sought to downplay the importance of the signed agreement, saying it’s a “technical” one and relates to bilateral ties and not security issues.\n\nAlthough Serbia said it supports Ukraine’s territorial integrity, its right-wing government has repeatedly refused to join Western sanctions against Slavic ally Russia. Aligning foreign policies with the EU is one of the main preconditions for joining the 27-nation bloc, but Serbia has increasingly defied calls to do so.\n\n﻿The news of the deal triggered harsh criticism from both EU and U.S. officials.\n\nEuropean Commission spokesman Peter Stano warned on Monday that Serbia’s relations with Russia can’t be “business as usual” when Moscow is violating the U.N. Charter with its armed forces committing atrocities in Ukraine.\n\n“It’s a very clear sign of their intention to strengthen their ties, to further strengthen relations between Serbia and Russia and this is raising serious questions,” he said. “We are taking this very seriously and we are following this up.”\n\nU.S. Ambassador Christopher R. Hill said “further alignment with Russia is a step in the wrong direction and contrary to Serbia’s stated European aspirations.”\n\n“The United States believes that no country should be expanding cooperation with Russia while it continues its war of aggression against Ukraine,” Hill said in a statement to The Associated Press. “News of this agreement signed with Russia was surprising and stands in stark contrast with other constructive meetings in New York with Serbian officials.”\n\n\n\n",

    "Serbia signs foreign policy document with Russia amid escalation of Ukraine war": "Members of the European Parliament warned Serbia on September 25 that Belgrade’s signing of a consultation plan with the Russian foreign ministry puts its EU accession progress at risk.\n\nThe consultation plan for the years 2023-2024 was signed by the Serbian and Russian foreign ministries on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York on September 24, at a point when Russia appears to be making a serious escalation of the war in Ukraine.\n\nThis weekend, referendums are taking place in Russian occupied parts of Ukraine on whether to become part of the Russian Federation. The conduct of the referendums, with some voters reportedly forced to polling stations at gunpoint, leaves little doubt that the decision has already been made to annex the territories. This follows Russian President Vladimir Putin’s announcement of partial mobilisation in Russia on September 21.\n\nAs an EU candidate country, Serbia has already come in for criticism from EU officials and European politicians for its refusal to impose sanctions on Russia, in line with EU foreign policy. Pre-war, Belgrade pursued a successful ‘four pillar’ foreign policy, balancing its relations with the EU, the US, Russia and China, but this has become hard to maintain after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February.\n\nThe European Parliament's rapporteur on Serbia Vladimir Bilcik wrote in response to the signing of the agreement: “As a keen supporter of any steps towards a European Serbia, I find the news of planned consultations between Serbia & Russia a major blow to accession process in the Western Balkans. Let’s be clear: Russia is mobilising to attack EU candidate state Ukraine, Russia is attacking EU enlargement!”\n\nEuropean Parliament rapporteur for Kosovo Viola von Cramon also competed on the development on Twitter, linking it to Serbia’s EU accession process.\n\n“This is a serious scandal. In the midst of raging war, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Serbia signs the plan on future collaboration with the Russian aggressor. Or maybe it’s just a signal for us to freeze the EU accession talks as entering the EU does not go through Moscow,” she wrote.\n\nThe consolation plan was signed by the foreign ministers of Russia and Serbia, Sergei Lavrov and Nikola Selakovic.\n\nAt a press conference on September 25, Selakovic appeared to downplay the importance of the document, calling it a “technical matter” and pointing out that such documents have been signed since 1996.\n\nSerbia conflicted\n\nIn a sign of the conflicts within Serbia over its relations with Russia and the West, Selakovic told the same press conference that Belgrade cannot accept the results of the referendum in the Ukrainian regions.\n\n“[I]t would be completely contrary to our national interests, our policy of preserving territorial integrity and sovereignty and commitment to the principle of inviolability of borders,” he said — a reference to Serbia’s own situation related to Kosovo’s unilateral declaration of independence.\n\nThere is speculation that the signing of the consultation plan with the Russia foreign ministry was intended to send a signal that Serbia is not moving decisively towards the West, despite its decision not to recognise the referendums in Ukraine.\n\nSerbia also sent a message about the priority it places on EU accession last weekend when it hosted the EuroPride 2002 parade in the face of strong opposition from the Serbian Orthodox Church and conservative groups linked to Russia.\n\nHowever, there remains a strong pro-Russian contingent in Serbia.\n\nInterior Minister Aleksandar Vulin, one of the more pro-Russian members of the Serbian cabinet, responded to Bilčik on September 25. “[T]he territorial integrity of Serbia is being attacked by 22 member states of the European Union, recognizing the fake state of Kosovo. Let's face it, this is a big blow to Serbia's European path,” said Vulin, as quoted by N1.\n\n“[T]o be clear, Serbia chooses its friends, and its enemies make themselves known,” he added.\n\nVulin has previously clashed with Energy and Mining Minister Zorana Mihajlovic, when the latter criticised Lavrov after Vulin’s visit to Moscow in August. Mihajlovic has accused the Russian foreign minister of “abusing” Serbia’s decision not to impose sanctions on Russia by falsely claiming Serbia supports Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMeanwhile, Misa Vacic, the leader of the far-right nationalist Serbian Right party, is one of the international observers for the referendums in occupied Ukraine. Vacic is currently in Volgograd where he is observing the vote at refugee camps housing people who have fled Ukraine but are still allowed to vote in the referendum, Russian and Serbian media reported.\n\nDuring his visit, Vacic reportedly presented the deputy governor of the Volgograd region with a T-shirt bearing the image of convicted war criminal Ratko Mladic.",

In late 2020, the Serbian government recapitalised the airline to the amount of 100 million euros and took an additional 31% stake in the company. “We are grateful to the Government of the Republic of Serbia for providing support to the national airline to overcome business obstacles caused by the coronavirus pandemic”, the carrier noted. Air Serbia has previously said it plans to end this year break even or with a small profit. It reported a loss of 77 million euros during the pandemic-stricken 2020, which was decreased to a loss of 21.3 million euros last year.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommenting on the airline’s ownership structure, Air Serbia’s CEO, Jiri Marek, recently said, “Air Serbia has played an important role during the pandemic, supporting the Serbian government with repatriation flights, as well as the uplift of medical equipment and so on. I think we've proven that our operations do not only contribute to connectivity, but also bring significant economic benefits. We believe the government wants a strong national carrier that continues to grow. There are various models in the industry with different participation structures and different levels of state participation. Even combinations of private and state shareholding is possible. It is up to the Serbian government to find the most suitable model”.",

Putin followed up on his mobilization order on September 24 by imposing harsher penalties against Russians who willingly surrendered to Ukrainian forces or refused orders to mobilize.\n\nRussian officials have said that up to 300,000 reserve forces will be called up and that only those with relevant combat and service experience will be drafted to fight. However, Russian media reports have surfaced saying that men who have never been in the military or who are past draft age are being called up, and foreign media have reported that the real goal is to mobilize more than 1 million soldiers, which the Kremlin denies.\n\nWestern officials say that Russia has suffered 70,000 to 80,000 casualties, accounting for both deaths and injuries, since it launched its unprovoked war in Ukraine in February.\n\nThe mobilization to replenish those losses has seen men across Russia sent to register and to reports of Russian citizens attempting to flee the country.\n\nSeveral military enlistment centers and other administrative buildings in the country have been targeted in arson attacks in recent days, and on September 26 a military commissioner was shot by an apparent recruit at an enlistment center in Siberia.\n\nMedia reports say the 25-year-old shooter had been called to report to the office in the city of Ust-Ilimsk for mobilization that day.\n\nThe draft has also led to rare complaints by pro-Kremlin voices.\n\nMargarita Simonyan, the editor in chief of the state-backed media outlet RT, wrote on her Telegram channel on September 24 that while it had been announced that only people up to the age of 35 would be recruited, \"summonses are going to 40-year-olds.\"\n\n\"They're infuriating people, as if on purpose, as if out of spite,\" Simonyan said of the authorities behind the draft.\n\nThe same day, the head of the Russian president's Human Rights Council, Valery Fadeyev, called on Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu to put a halt to the manner with which many draft boards in the country were proceeding.\n\nOn September 25, two of Russia's most senior lawmakers weighed in on the growing controversy.\n\nIn a Telegram post, Valentina Matviyenko, chairwoman of Russia's Federation Council, said that she was aware of reports that men who should be ineligible for the draft are being called up.\n\n\"Such excesses are absolutely unacceptable.

    "Serbia seeks fighter it might choose MiG-35 or JF-17 Block 3": "BELGRADE ($1=121.06 Serbian Dinars) — The Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Serbia is in the process of renewing its armament. Serbian sources say the time has come for a new Serbian fighter jet. Serbia has already bought Pantsir-S1 mobile air defense systems, the Chinese FK-3 anti-aircraft surface-to-air missile system, and the Chinese CH-92A reconnaissance and attack drones.\n\nPhoto credit: Pan.bg\n\nSerbian pilots are impressed by the Russian fighter MiG-35 4++ generation. As BulgarianMilitary.com previously wrote, the MiG-35 is one of the most successful Russian fighters, in no way inferior to its competitors in the same class. However, Russia is gradually abandoning the project, and if it does not find a customer soon, the MiG-35 will be forgotten, like many other Russian weapons.\n\nThe MiG-35 will be rejected by Belgrade. The reasons will not be the operational capabilities of the aircraft or the characteristics. The reasons will be political, local analysts comment. According to them, the fear that Washington will attack such a decision by Belgrade with economic sanctions under the CAATSA law will dissuade the Serbs. The possibility of this happening leans more towards one hundred percent.\n\nSome Serbian experts immediately turned their attention to another alternative. Of course, it is not an American opportunity, but a Chinese one. China’s JF-17 Bok 3. As already mentioned, Serbia buys from China. Sources close to Serbian political circles in Belgrade believe that the JF-17 Bok 3 will be not only a compromise but also a successful solution to the Serbian fighter jet crisis. Currently, the Serbian Air Force operates only 14 units of obsolete MiG-29s.\n\nPhoto credit: Pakistan Air Force\n\nWhy the JF-17 Bok III? The JF-17 Bok III is a 4th generation fighter but is equipped with 5th generation avionics and weapons. The operational costs of the fighter are low and this will also influence the decision. Also, the JF-17 Block III uses technology from the J-20 stealth fighter.\n\nSerbian experts comment that in case of possible prolonged air attacks, a Chinese fighter is an optimal option. The airframe of the JF-17 is capable of maintaining a high level of readiness. Aircraft maintenance is also kept to a minimum. Last but not least, it is expected that if Serbia buys the JF-17 it will receive it with its full armament. I.e. Belgrade will acquire high-class air-to-air missiles.\n\nSerbia may decide to turn to France and try to acquire Rafael. But, JF-17 and MiG-29 have a common engine. I.e. Belgrade may decide not to retire its MiG-29 fleet, but to augment it with JF-17s. However, this means that the Serbian budget will be increased more than expected because the MiG-29 will need a heavy modernization.\n\n***\n\nFollow us everywhere and at any time.

    "Serbia: International Conference on Human Resources Management": "Belgrade\n\nThe adoption of the Law on Employees in Autonomous Provinces and Local Self-Government Units in 2016 established the basic principles of professional service system for employees working in the bodies of autonomous provinces and local self-governments in Serbia. This laid the foundations for the introduction of a modern human resources management system.\n\nThe Centre of Expertise for Good Governance of the Council of Europe has provided support to the modernisation of human resources management at local level in Serbia during the last decade. In the framework of the Programme “Human Resources Management in Local Self-Government – phase 2”, it organised an International Conference on Human Resources Management, on 20 September 2022 in Belgrade. The main results achieved in Human Resources Management within the ongoing Public Administration Reform in Serbia were presented.\n\nOpening speeches were delivered by Ms Nadia Ćuk, Deputy Head of the Council of Europe Office in Belgrade, Ms Alina Tatarenko, Head of the Democratic Governance Division, Council of Europe, Mr Martin Klaucke, Head of Operation II, Delegation of the European Union to the Republic of Serbia, Ms Sanja Putnik, Assistant Minister, Ministry of Public Administration and Local Self-Government and Mr Nikola Tarbuk, Secretary General, Standing Conference of Towns and Municipalities.\n\nConference participants were introduced to the new Human Resources Management Toolkit of the Council of Europe, which includes indications regarding the creation of job descriptions, the recruitment procedure, evaluation and performance management and the inclusion of a gender perspective in a modern HRM system. Mr Jonathan Barber, the Council of Europe expert, said that it can be an extremely practical document for improving HRM in local administrations. This is of particular importance because the local administration is the level of government which is closer to the citizens. For them to have trust in and be satisfied with the services provided by the public administration, it is necessary to constantly improve competences and capacities of the municipal employees.\n\nFor this reason, fifty municipalities and cities applied for and received support from the Council of Europe Programme through the \"support packages\". This experience is also valuable for other municipalities in Serbia: ultimately, the joint aim of all partners is to modernise the management of human resources in the country, and to improve governance at local level in accordance with the European values and standards.\n\nThe Programme “Human Resources Management in Local Self-Government – Phase 2” is a joint project financed by the European Union and the Council of Europe and implemented by the Council of Europe in Serbia, in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Administration and Local Self-Government and the Standing Conference of Towns and Municipalities.",
    "Serbia’s Move to Cancel EuroPride Shows How Vučić Plays Off West Against Russia and His Base": "The Serbian government is moving to cancel a long-planned parade in Belgrade this Saturday as part of the annual pan-European EuroPride celebration, hosted in a different European city each year, after thousands of religious conservatives marched on Sept. 11 to, as they put it, protect Serbian “traditional values.” President Alexander Vučić’s decision last month to cancel the weeklong celebration and the Serbian police announcement on Sept. 13 that it was banning Saturday’s parade may be part of his strategy of constantly playing the West and Serbian moderates off against Moscow and his domestic right-wing base. The EuroPride decisions and events, for example, should be seen within the context of Vučić’s decisions around the same time to accede to an agreement brokered by the European Union and the United States over border ID disputes with Kosovo.\n\nVučić’s decision to cancel EuroPride stands in contrast to Serbia’s historic role as one of the most pro-LGBTQ countries in the Balkans. Serbian activists have been organizing marches since 2001, and in 2014, Vučić took steps to back these activists by authorizing and mobilizing police to protect marchers from the threat of violent right-wing protestors. This official backing lent the marches an air of legitimacy, and Pride events in Serbia have since drawn activists from all over the region, including members of the European Union Parliament and the Western diplomatic corps. Pride marches have been violence-free since 2014 and became normalized.\n\nThat yielded Belgrade Pride sufficient political backing by European LGBTQ groups and the Serbian government in support of Belgrade Pride’s bid to host European Pride (EuroPride) in 2022. It marks the first time a Slavic country has hosted European Pride and a major step forward by Serbia in support of European LGBTQ human rights.\n\nWhy then take this step to cancel EuroPride, one that is sure to upset the leadership of many Western governments and human rights organizations, even as Vučić continues to give at least lip service to the country’s aspirations for EU membership? The move illustrates how Vučić’s power rests largely on his ability to balance the West and Russia, in turn mollifying and extracting concessions and promises from each as they fear that Serbia will fall under the other side’s influence.\n\nThis constant game is evident in everything Vučić does. He refused to join EU sanctions against Russia in the spring, but in June declared — as he frequently does — that joining the EU is in Serbia’s best interest. On the same day he announced the cancelation of the EuroPride event, Aug. 27, he also said he would propose that openly lesbian Prime Minister Ana Brnabić be re-elected by Serbia’s National Assembly to an unprecedented third term heading his Cabinet. She has since been re-elected. This balancing act has allowed Vučić to negotiate, among other things, favorable arms deals with Moscow, while bringing in significant economic aid from the EU.\n\nAs a young member of Serbia’s Parliament in 1995, Vučić in a now-infamous speech during the war in neighboring Bosnia, vowed to Serbia’s parliament that “For every Serb killed, we will kill 100 Muslims.” Within a few years, he joined Slobodan Milošević’s government, serving as minister of information during the 1998-1999 war in Kosovo.\n\nToday’s older Vučić is more pragmatic, a man who demonstrates allegiance to Moscow but understands well that he needs the West for Serbia’s — and his own — financial survival, via EU accession and the generous economic support that comes with it. Over the duration of his leadership, Vučić has toned down his rhetoric to a certain extent and pledged to bring Serbia closer to the EU, but still regularly takes steps that seem more aligned with the Kremlin than with Brussels.\n\nThe intersection of the EuroPride events with the Serbia-Kosovo border dispute was typical. On Aug. 27, the same day Vučić sought to cancel EuroPride, he not only endorsed Brnabić as prime minister again but also reached an EU and U.S.-brokered agreement with Kosovo to resolve their dispute over identification for border crossings. The accord would undoubtedly have angered the Kremlin, which has been among the outliers globally in rejecting recognition of Kosovo’s sovereignty since it declared independence from Serbia in 2008. The day before Vučić’s accord with Kosovo, on Aug. 26, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Europe and Eurasia Gabriel Escobar had declared that it was time to forget the narrative that “Kosovo is Serbia” and start saying that “Kosovo and Serbia are actually Europe.” Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova quickly responded , “Never.”\n\nMoscow, of course, also has long made its own phobias clear on issues related to LGBTQ rights. In 2013, for instance, Putin’s regime escalated its campaign against LGBTQ Russians with ”gay propaganda” laws that prohibited information for minors on LGBTQ issues, essentially a dog whistle against gays and lesbians and homosexuality. Such onerous laws are bolstered by the Russian government’s close relationship with the Russian Orthodox Church, which the Kremlin has long wielded as an instrument of foreign meddling and sowing of chaos, including in the Balkans.\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church maintains close relations with the Serbian Orthodox Church, which organized last weekend’s right-wing protest in Belgrade, according to the Associated Press, and both churches are known to maintain close ties with their respective governments. Both churches seek to safeguard what they perceive as the “traditional values” of their respective societies, so it was no surprise when Serbian Patriarch Porfirije supported the Serbian government’s decision to cancel EuroPride, which he said was not in accordance with traditional Serbian values – “the pillars on which our identity has been built for centuries.” Porfirije’s stance mirrors that of the Russian Orthodox Church, which for years has been a vocal opponent of holding public Pride events in Russia. In fact, last weekend’s right-wing Belgrade protest even featured Russian flags and portraits of Putin, the AP reported.\n\nIt’s clear the decisions by Vučić’s government against EuroPride mark just the latest iteration of his manipulative balancing act between the West and more moderate forces in Serbia on the one hand and Russia and his far-right base on the other. The West must ensure that his strategy of playing these sides off against each other, to the detriment of the EU values that Serbia must embrace to gain membership, backfires, and understand the complex games Vučić is playing. Make no mistake: Unrestrained, Vučić’s anti-Western and anti-human rights decisions will only become more extreme.\n\nIMAGE: Orthodox Christian believers hold icons as part of a joint “prayer for salvation of Serbia” on September, 11, 2022, during a rally “for marriage and family” in Belgrade called by the Serbian Orthodox Church against an upcoming EuroPride event. Thousands of demonstrators protested against the upcoming pan-European EuroPride celebration in the Serbian capital Belgrade on September 11, 2022, days before the gathering of the LGBTQ community was set to be held. Tensions have been simmering in the capital with pride organisers vowing to carry on with the gathering scheduled for September 17, 2022, after the Serbian government pulled its support for the event.

    "Serbia to get 500-million-euro loan for Belgrade-Niš railway line": "2013, Wikimedia Commons/Gogo303, Based on Pan-European corridors.svg\n\nSerbia will in all likelihood secure a loan of 500 million euros from the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in order to upgrade the railway line connecting Belgrade to Niš. Once this upgrade is completed, freight and passenger trains will be able to run at a speed of 200 kilometres per hour from Niš up till Novi Sad, north of Belgrade.\n\nThe loan has already passed the ‘concept review’ stage and is currently under ‘structure review’, as the EBRD describes it. Once all the lights are green, the project can go ahead. The approval deadline is 30 November.\n\nCorridor X\n\nWhile the railway section is only 228 kilometres long, it forms a relevant link for rail freight across Europe. This is because it lies at the heart of the so-called Corridor X, which runs from Salzburg in Austria to Thessaloniki in Greece, and via a second branch from Budapest in Hungary to Istanbul in Turkey. These two branches form the shape of an X, and the lines intersect in the middle of Serbia – on the Belgrade-Niš line.\n\nThe aim of the modernisation works is to enable a speed increase to up to 200 kilometres per hour. At such a speed, the journey would be covered in 1 hour and 15 minutes, whereas the current travel time between Belgrade and Niš is 5,5 hours. The works will be carried out by SRI, a joint stock company established as the sole national railway infrastructure asset management company of Serbia.\n\nEuropean interest\n\nAlthough there are parts of Corridor X that are financed by China, and in the past also by Russia, the EU is taking a clear stance with the financing of the central part of the network. As one European Commission official put it several months ago, it is in the EU’s key interest to pursue its enlargement policy more effectively. In that view, the construction of critical infrastructure is central to the Western Balkans.\n\nThis article first appeared on RailFreight.com.\n\nFurther reading:",

    "Chinese Influence in Serbia": "This report is a part of #CCPinCEE, a series of reports published by the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) analyzing Chinese influence efforts and operations across the nations of Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nGoals and objectives of CCP malign influence\n\nThe rise of Chinese influence in Serbia began in 2009, when the two countries agreed to cooperate on economic matters and technological and infrastructure development. A subsequent formal “partnership” was declared in 2016. ) China is also a strong presence in Serbian politics, as well as digitalization and security. But the environmental impact of its high-profile projects has begun to make it the target of protests, locally and nationally.\n\nSerbia has become a “poster child” for Chinese influence. Belgrade and Beijing present cooperation as beneficial and friendly, and political leaders talk of ‘’brotherhood’’ and a “steel friendship,” an allusion to China’s 2016 purchase of a Serbian steel mill. The ruling political majority’s championing of China has gotten results: Polls show that 83% of Serbian citizens see China as a friendly country and 77% view its impact on Serbia as positive.\n\nChinese influence in Serbia is spread through various means, directly through the activities of the Chinese government, or more visibly in tandem with domestic politicians. While it is not simple to categorize a wide set of tools, the most conspicuous and successful have been economic cooperation between Serbia and China, activities of the Chinese Embassy, bilateral visits, “mask and vaccine diplomacy,” and cooperation with Serbian media. Other, less prominent, arenas of influence are culture, sports, and technology.\n\nThe main avenue of Chinese influence in Serbia is preferential loans by Chinese banks to fund infrastructure projects, for which Serbian politicians portray China as a white knight. These deals are often opaque, with no public explanation of how or why Chinese companies are chosen to work on them. Since 2009, Serbia and China have agreed on infrastructure projects worth more than $7.5 bn, financially tying Serbia to China for more than a decade. The total amount of the loan agreements and certain aspects of the contracts raise the specter of corruption, especially because the average costs of the projects are higher than in similar cases elsewhere in Europe. In addition to the infrastructure loans, China has significantly upped its investment in Serbia over the past decade, topping $2.2 bn since 2009. While that is a fraction of the 17 bn-plus euros that EU countries have poured into Serbia in the same period, making the bloc the largest investor, China became Serbia’s largest single country investor in 2021, putting in more than 700 million euros. The short-term economic benefits of the Chinese capital influx are indisputable, but the potential long-term consequences are questionable. Chinese investments have been mostly in export-oriented industries, meaning that most of the profits will go to Chinese companies and that Serbia’s take will be limited. There are also serious concerns about labor practices and the environmental impacts of these projects.\n\nThe Chinese Embassy plays a significant role in promoting Chinese influence in Serbia. Ambassador Chen Bo meets regularly with top Serbian officials, including President Aleksandar Vučić. Her statements emphasize the role of China and Chinese companies in Serbia’s economic development, echoing a narrative pushed by domestic officials. She is also on hand at construction sites when Chinese projects are presented as a boon to Serbian infrastructure and regularly attends press conferences when Chinese projects are announced or promoted. In addition to the work of the Chinese Embassy, officials from Beijing regularly visit Belgrade.\n\nEfforts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic further cemented China’s influence. As it did elsewhere, Beijing reached out to politicians, who in Serbia were much more receptive than their counterparts in some other countries. Chinese-Serbian amity reached new highs during the pandemic, including among the general public, in turn opening up new possibilities for the spread of Chinese influence.\n\nWhile Chinese influence in Serbian media is hard to identify, there are key examples of Chinese interference. China Radio International has its own Serbian outlet as well as Serbian radio stations that broadcast content from CRI. But the second, more important feature, is the promotion of the pro-CCP media in Serbia. Chinese funding of media in Serbia is not as visible as its content’s reach, direct influence comes from promotional op-eds and articles that appear in some mainstream outlets. It is fair to say that the media play a significant role in creating a nation of “China lovers,” but the reasoning is twofold: direct Chinese media interference and close political relations with the ruling majority in Serbia.\n\nSources: The World Factbook 2022, (Washington, DC: Central Intelligence Agency, 2020), https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/; World Bank, The World Bank Group, 2022, https://www.worldbank.org/en/home; “Parliamentary friendship group – China,” National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia, Retrieved June 21, 2022, http://www.parlament.gov.rs/national-assembly/composition/parliamentary-friendship-groups/parliamentary-friendship-groups.308.499.html\n\nReach of influence measures\n\nInfrastructure projects by Chinese companies, backed by loans from Chinese banks, are the foundation of China’s popularity. Serbian politicians hail them as crucial to the country’s infrastructure and economic development, saving jobs in factories and companies that were failing before being purchased by Chinese companies. The hype escalated during the COVID-19 crisis, when Vučić said China was the only country that could help Serbia in the fight against the pandemic, initially dismissing the very notion of European solidarity. With ceremonial receptions organized for the arrival of medical aid from China, Chinese “mask diplomacy” gained a lot of traction in Serbia.\n\nWhile the assistance was initially presented as a donation, Serbian politicians later admitted that Serbia had also purchased medical equipment from China. Exactly how much equipment, and at what cost, has been designated a state secret. Nor has the government disclosed the details of its acquisition of several million vaccines from Pfizer/BioNtech, AstraZeneca, Sputnik V, and Sinopharm, except to say that Sinopharm was the largest provider. This opacity has received no pushback from the opposition or the international community. While the exact funding has not been disclosed, Beijing has been portrayed as the most ardent supporter of Serbia and its citizens in the immunization process, in a win for its “vaccine diplomacy” in the Western Balkans’s largest country.\n\nTarget audiences and populations\n\nChina’s influence has risen across Serbian society. Polls show all age groups, urban and rural and regardless of gender, hold a positive view of the country. That is largely thanks to the political relationship between China and Serbia, which has helped make China Serbia’s largest trading partner; the breadth of relations between China and Serbia, in health, economic development, media, culture, and elsewhere; and the power that the dominant Serbian Progressive Party holds in the political system.\n\nUntil recently, China has not been a target for political parties outside the ruling majority, mainly because the leaders of the opposition were in power when the initial China-Serbia agreements were signed. Still, some in the opposition have begun to call out the environmental toll on areas where Chinese companies operate, and local activists have begun to confront China over its labor and environmental practices. Chinese influence in Serbia is hard to counteract, given its backing by the Serbian government, but local activists, nongovernmental organizations, and now some parts of the opposition are trying.\n\nPhoto: A dumper truck travels along a trail in the open copper pit in the Serbian town of Bor, June 8, 2013. Credit: REUTERS/Marko Djurica\n\nConclusion\n\nOver the past decade, Serbia has become a hub of Chinese influence in the Western Balkans, eager for economic cooperation via credit agreements for infrastructure projects and foreign direct investment. All the while, Serbia’s political elite, led by Vučić, have been cheerleaders for these deals. The Chinese have also used the COVID-19 pandemic to advance their interests in Serbia by distributing medical assistance and vaccines. While the rise of Chinese influence remains unchallenged by domestic political actors, it has faced resistance from some in the political opposition, as well as the environmental groups due to Chinese companies’ harmful practices in Serbia. Still, China remains one of the most popular partners for the Serbian government as well as a key partner for Serbian economic development.\n\nIn summation, China has significantly extended its presence in Slovenia over the last few years. However, while Beijing’s increased economic weight has brought more opportunities to exert political clout, its influence has been relatively modest. With a relatively small media and social media presence, Chinese actors have steered away from overtly aggressive diplomacy and have treaded softly. Chinese pressure usually becomes obvious only when Beijing pushes back on specific issues it sees as harmful to China’s national image and interests. The Chinese acquisition of Gorenje is increasingly seen as a success story, and Huawei has managed to capture the Slovenian market and to win the trust of key decision-makers. At the same time, fear of China’s economic retaliation has discouraged a more united political front in support of Taiwan. Yet, to the surprise of many, Chinese ambitions to invest in Slovenia’s strategic infrastructure have been watered down. Evidently, the Slovenian government has in general put political considerations over China’s economic appeal, which will in any event continue to serve as the main axis in Slovenia’s overall China policy orientation.",

(AP Photo/Mark Baker)\n\nSYDNEY (AP) — Bec Allen was instrumental in Australia’s 69-54 win over Serbia scoring 16 points on Sunday in the World Cup.\n\nBut her status for the rest of the tournament is in question after getting hurt in the fourth quarter.\n\nAllen was diving for a loose ball in front of the Australia bench when she took a knee to her midsection. She was down on the court for a few minutes before she was helped off by team trainers. She was later taken in a wheelchair to the back with about 20 seconds left in the game.\n\n“We’ll have to wait for the doctor and see,” Australia coach Sandy Brondello said. “It would be really unfortunate as she’s played really well for us and she’s a key member of our team.”\n\nAustralia (2-1) avenged a loss to Serbia earlier in the year in a World Cup qualifier.\n\nIn other games on Sunday, France beat Mali 74-59 and Canada topped Japan 70-56.\n\nThe Opals jumped out to a 18-10 lead after one quarter which delighted the pro-Australian crowd of 9,329 fans. Lauren Jackson scored five points in the period and the team played stellar defense, forcing Serbia into four shotclock violations.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAustralia still led by eight at the half and started to pull away in the third quarter. Sami Whitcomb, who added 10 points, had to briefly leave the game in the third quarter when she took a shot to the bridge of her nose, opening up a cut. She sat out for a few minutes while medics stopped the bleeding before returning.\n\nSerbia never really threatened the rest of the way.\n\nYvonne Anderson scored 16 points to lead Serbia (1-2).\n\nCANADA 70, JAPAN 56\n\nBridget Carleton scored 19 points and Shay Colley added 13 to help Canada stay perfect in pool play and advance to the quarterfinals.\n\nCanada (3-0) led 28-25 in the second quarter before scoring the final 13 points of the half to blow the game open. Colley had five points during the game-changing run.\n\nEvery time Japan (1-2) tried to make a run in the second half, Canada would have an answer.\n\nJapan, which won the silver medal at the Tokyo Olympics last year, is in danger of missing the quarterfinals.\n\nMaki Takada scored 11 to lead Japan.\n\nFRANCE 74, MALI 59\n\nGabby Williams scored 14 points and Alexia Chartereau added 12 to help France beat Mali.\n\nFrance (2-1) got off to a slow start, trailing 21-17 after the first quarter. Mali led 29-26 midway through the second period before the French closed the half on a 16-3 run.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMali (0-3) was able to get within 65-57 midway through the fourth quarter before Williams found Sarah Michel for a 3-pointer and France led by double-digits the rest of the way. Williams also had seven rebounds and six assists.\n\n“They played really tough tonight,” Williams said. “It wasn’t as pretty a win as you wanted. They played really hard, but I’m proud of my team.”\n\nSika Kone led Mali (0-3) with 18 points and 18 rebounds, one short of the World Cup record held by three players, including U.S. great Katrina McClain.\n\n___\n\nMore AP women’s basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/womens-basketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"
