    "Four arrested over alleged plot to kidnap Belgian justice minister": "Police in the Netherlands have arrested four suspects over what Belgium’s justice minister described as a plan to kidnap him.\n\nVincent Van Quickenborne, who is also the mayor of the city of Kortrijk in western Flanders, appeared to blame a “drug mafia” in a video message run by state broadcaster RTBF.\n\nAddressing an audience at a local ball, he said that in a phone call on Thursday, a federal prosecutor had warned him of a kidnap plan targeting him.\n\nOn Saturday Van Quickenborne said: “I will be placed under strict security for the time being and will not be able to participate in some planned activities in the coming days. It’s not pleasant, but understandable.\n\n“Let me be clear: the people behind this are achieving the opposite of what they aim for. It strengthens me in the belief that we need to keep fighting. The criminals feel trapped. That feeling is right. Because we will continue to fight organised crime, with more manpower and resources than before.\n\n“In our democratic rule of law we will never fold to violence. Never.”\n\nFederal prosecutors said on Saturday that police had beefed up security for Van Quickenborne, citing a serious “threat”. They said three people had been detained in the Netherlands and that Belgian authorities were seeking their extradition.\n\nA spokesman for the Dutch prosecutor’s office in the Hague said the trio, all Dutch, were aged 20, 29 and 48. On Sunday, a judicial source said a fourth suspect had been arrested in the Netherlands.\n\nBelgian prime minister Alexander De Croo tweeted on Saturday that the threat to Quickenborne was “totally unacceptable. But it must be clear: we will not be intimidated by anyone. The work continues.”\n\nFollowing a report in the Flemish daily Het Laatste Nieuws, the source confirmed to AFP that an automatic weapon had been found in a vehicle spotted near the minister’s home in Kortrijk. Belgian news outlet VRT reported that the vehicle contained Kalashnikovs, other firearms and two bottles of petrol.\n\nThe prosecutor’s office said it had been informed last week of a “possible threat”, which led to an investigation. It would not provide further details.",
    "Belgium: heat rising over cost of living": "Thousands of Belgian workers will join a trade union rally in Brussels today, to defend their purchasing power.\n\nBack on the streets—workers on the June 20th march in Brussels (CSC)\n\nSome 64 per cent of Belgians are afraid of not being able to pay their energy bills, according to a poll published on Monday by some of the country’s most important news networks. Faced with this surge in prices and the fear of not being able to cope financially, most Belgians say they have changed their behaviour. Nearly eight out of ten are using less electricity, gas, water or heating fuel, the poll indicates.\n\nAt current tariffs, the average Belgian family will have to pay an annual bill of €10,000 for gas and electricity. That’s ten times more than last year. These calculations by the country’s energy economists are very similar to those in neighbouring countries and indeed all over Europe.\n\nProfits explosion\n\nThis dramatic erosion of citizens’ purchasing power stands in stark contrast to the explosion of the profits of multinational companies in Belgium, as elsewhere. Just two figures to illustrate this: Total made an extraordinary profit of €10 billion in the first of semester 2022, Engie €5 billion.\n\nAs the veteran economist Joseph Stiglitz stresses, energy companies ‘didn’t do anything to deserve’ this windfall: ‘All that is going on is a redistribution from consumers to rich fossil fuel companies.’ And with other European countries such as Spain and Italy—even the market-fundamentalist United Kingdom—having already introduced windfall taxes, Belgian unions call on their public authorities to tax, heavily and urgently, the super-profits of the energy industrial groups and other companies present in the country.\n\nCommon European action will be key, and the European Trade Union Confederation has advanced a six-point-plan, calling for price caps and reform of the European energy market, among other things. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development also supports windfall taxes and the European Commission proposed last week a $140 billion tax on energy companies.\n\nBelgian unions also advocate action during the autumn for a balanced increase in the country’s minimum social-security benefits. Without social security more than 40 per cent of Belgian citizens would live below the national poverty line. Automatic indexation helps, as for Belgian wages: social-security benefits are increased when the cost-of-living index adds 2 per cent. But even with social security and automatic indexation, not everybody reaches the threshold for a life in dignity.\n\nThat’s why targeted proposals have been made by the unions on social security and its 2023 budget. The unions’ aim is also to maintain the insurance character of social security and attention should be paid to the calculation ceilings on pensions, among other benefits.\n\nWage law\n\nUnions reinforce their call on the government to repeal the wage law tightly limiting negotiated wage increases and to restore the freedom to negotiate—the motive behind earlier mobilisations. At the beginning of 2022, the Belgian unions launched a petition for the government to reform the law. More than 87,000 citizens signed it and in June 80,000 demonstrators took to the streets to make their voices heard.\n\nThese actions have borne fruit: on June 29th the Belgian parliament gave a hearing to three unions on the subject of the law on wages. Energy prices continue to soar, but the 1996 law prevents a fair increase in wages, especially in companies with high profits.\n\n\n\nWe need your support\n\nSocial Europe is an independent publisher and we believe in freely available content.

    "Belgium in Brief: All hail Belgium's cycling king": "At just 22 years old, Remco Evenepoel hasn't had an easy ride. Two years ago he came close to losing his career (and life) before it properly started as he crashed and fell almost 10 metres from a bridge into a ravine.\n\nYet after a difficult comeback season in 2021, the young star has put to bed any doubts about his ability as he won the cycling World Championship in Australia yesterday. If this weren't impressive enough, Evenepoel (from Aalst, just to the west of Brussels) had already won the three-week Vuelta a España earlier this month.\n\nThe World Championships offer an almost unique spectacle as teams are composed by nation rather than the trade team they ride for. Unlike in other sports, where there might be multiple opportunities each year to play for your national side, road cycling has very few races where you compete as a team with compatriots.\n\nThis unusual arrangement can become all the more challenging as riders who normally are arch-rivals find themselves riding side by side. Unlike team sports, in cycling there is really only one winner. The tension was visible in last year's World Championship, which had the additional hype of taking place in Flanders.\n\nBelgium was dreaming of a home winner and the man for the job was the celebrated Wout Van Aert – one of the top one-day racers in the world and probably the number one last year. Yet even before the race, Evenepoel faced very public criticism for riding selfishly and there were fears that a team rift could ruin Belgium's winning chances. The youngster himself had found occasion to vent his frustrations which did little to endear him to the media.\n\nBut after such a stellar 2022 season, the precocious Belgian can expect a rapprochement with the press. From us at The Brussels Times, congrats Remco!\n\nDid you watch the worlds?

    "Nations League: Denmark stun France while Van Dijk sinks Belgium": "Nations League holders France lost 2-0 to Denmark in their final Group A game but salvaged their place in the top tier at the end of a dismal campaign on Sunday.\n\nDidier Deschamps’ side, who will face Denmark in the World Cup in November, finished third in the Nations League standings with five points from six games after Kasper Dolberg and Andreas Skov Olsen scored first-half goals for the hosts. Austria were relegated to League B after a 3-1 defeat at home to Croatia left them bottom of the group on four points.\n\nCroatia qualified for the final four with 13 points, one ahead of Denmark, who burst into life against France after being dominated in the first 20 minutes. World champions France, who had several first-choice players out injured including Paul Pogba, Karim Benzema and Hugo Lloris, were a far cry from their best and Deschamps will be crossing fingers that all have recovered for the tournament in Qatar.\n\n“We had a lot of chances, but we were not aggressive enough and made several technical mistakes,” Deschamps said. “We had a young team and they don’t have the experience of a high level. Tonight was a reality check. I’m not worried for the World Cup because we’ll get most of our injured players back in time. We don’t however think we’re stronger than the others and we know it’s going to be a big fight.”\n\nCroatia, who needed victory to assure top spot, went ahead through Luka Modric but were pegged back three minutes later. The points were sealed when Marko Livaja headed home at the back post after a cross from Ivan Perisic, before Dejan Lovren was left free by the home defenders to score with a header from Lovro Majer’s cross.\n\nFrance coach Didier Deschamps said he was not worried about their form going into the World Cup Photograph: Fabian Bimmer/Reuters\n\nCaptain Virgil van Dijk netted a second-half winner as the Netherlands beat Belgium 1-0 on Sunday to ensure top spot in their Nations League group and a place in next year’s finals tournament. Van Dijk powered home a header from a corner in the 73rd minute at the Amsterdam Arena to ensure the Dutch finished runaway winners in League A Group Four.\n\nThey finished with 16 points, six more than Belgium who had a chance to leapfrog their neighbours, and take first place, but needed to win by three goals or more on Sunday to do so.\n\nIn Group C1, the Faroe Islands stunned Turkey with a 2-1 home win, although Turkey will still be promoted to League B as group winners, with the Faroes in third place.",

    "Report: England MU18s 2-1 Belgium": "A well-worked move saw Belgium create their best chance of breaking the deadlock ten minutes before the interval when Manchester City stopper True Grant, son of former Derby, Burnley, and Manchester United goalkeeper Lee, had to make a fine save to keep the scores level.\n\nBut the Young Lions responded well after the break and came out of the blocks refreshed in the second half – having two efforts in two minutes.\n\nThe first chance in particular showed England’s ability to move the ball incisively and with purpose. Ndala, who switched to the left flank to get at the Belgium defence, picked out Arsenal’s Amario Cozier-Duberry on the right but he could only shoot straight at the goalkeeper.\n\nA fast-paced beginning to the second half continued when Belgium had a huge chance to take the lead, but Fofana was unable to stretch enough to make clean contact from six yards after the ball was flashed in low from the left by Idumbo Muzambo.\n\nA frantic five minutes then ensued, with Grant having to make a crucial double save – first low to his right and then high to his left as England were put on the backfoot.\n\nAnd after 68 minutes, an unfortunate breakdown in communication between Grant and captain Josh Feeney (pictured above) led to the defender heading backwards over his oncoming goalkeeper and into an empty net to give Belgium the lead.\n\nBut England didn’t let their heads drop and were back level three minutes later as Cozier-Duberry linked up cleverly with Jamie Donley to break into the box and smash the ball home from a tight angle.\n\nGrant, quickly becoming the standout performer on the day, again had to be on his toes to produce another superb stop, this time from point blank range, and again from a low ball across the face of goal from the Belgian left which was stabbed goalward.\n\nIt was to prove crucual, as ten minutes from time substitute Dominic Ballard, scorer of both goals on Friday, got the winner for England as he poked home past Belgium ‘keeper Tom Poitoux.\n\nThe Little Red Devils’ second-half showing was chalk and cheese from their first, but they had two final opportunities to snatch a draw. Firstly, a good run by Enock Agyei saw the ball cut back to Roméo Monticelli on the edge of box but the substitute couldn’t find the net.\n\n\n\nA series of hopeful long balls forward were largely dealt with by the Young Lions, as Belgium looked for one last chance to salvage something.\n\nThat chance came with the final action of the match on 94 minutes, as a Belgian cross from the right was headed on target and destined for the bottom corner, only for Grant to ‘save’ his best until last, as he got down to his left once more and ensured the hard-fought win was England’s.\n\nEngland: 1 True Grant (Manchester City), 2 Jacob Wright (Manchester City), 3 Lino Sousa (Arsenal), 4 Kobbie Mainoo (Manchester United), 5 Tyler Fredricson (Manchester United), 6 Josh Feeney (Aston Villa) (c), 7 Joel Ndala (Manchester City), 8 Jobe Bellingham (Birmingham City), 9 Jamie Donley (Tottenham Hotspur), 10 Nico O’Reilly (Manchester City), 11 Amario Cozier-Duberry (Arsenal).\n\nSubstitutions: 14 Bobby Clark (Liverpool) on for O’Reilly (45’), 21 Kane Taylor (Manchester City) on for Sousa (45’), William Alves (Leicester City) on for Ndala (60’), 23 Sai Sachdev (Sheffield United) on for Wright (60’), 20 Dominic Ballard (Southampton) on for Donley (74’), 16 Leo Castledine (Chelsea) on for Bellingham (77’), 12 Alfie Dorrington (Tottenham Hotspur) on for Fredricson (77’), 15 Harry Whitwell (West Bromwich Albion) on for Mainoo (89’), 18 Samuel Rak-Sakyi (Chelsea) on for Cozier-Duberry (89’), 19 Max Alleyne (Manchester City) on for Feeney (89’).\n\nSubstitutes not used: 13.

    "Belgium’s diamonds lose shine amid Russia sanctions talk": "Press play to listen to this article Voiced by Amazon Polly\n\nANTWERP, Belgium — Russian diamonds are on Europe’s radar once again — as is Belgium’s fraught role in the industry.\n\nDespite six rounds of sweeping European Union sanctions against Moscow, Russian diamonds have remained a shining absence from the embargo list.\n\nTheir omission is due in part to Belgium’s prominent role in the diamond industry. Antwerp has, for generations, served as the main hub for diamonds arriving in Europe — including from Russia.\n\nBut that may change. Russia’s pledge to ramp up its military campaign in Ukraine has prompted the EU to accelerate work on a new sanctions package. And several diplomats said Belgium’s hesitance about a Russian diamond ban is increasingly untenable.\n\nPublicly, Belgium has pledged not to block diamond sanctions. It has also expressed concerns that such a move may harm EU economies more than Russia’s purse. Privately, Belgian diplomats have successfully lobbied EU officials to keep the precious stones off the sanctions list, according to numerous diplomats familiar with the sanctions discussions.\n\n“This position is becoming more difficult,” said an EU diplomat.\n\nThe result is that Belgium — and its unyielding support of an industry long linked to autocrats, dictators and conflict zones — is once again in an uncomfortable spotlight. The EU has already sanctioned Russian gold and other luxury goods. And now those long pushing for diamond sanctions, including the Baltic states, Poland and the Netherlands, are trying to pounce.\n\n“We’ve been pushing for sanctions on Russian diamonds for months,” said another EU diplomat.\n\nDiamond divergence\n\nRough Russian diamonds currently account for 30 percent of the global trade in the precious stone. And the U.S. Treasury Department estimates that diamonds are one of Russia’s top-10, non-energy exports, totaling over $4.5 billion in 2021.\n\nYet even amid the war, Belgian leaders have not distanced themselves from the country’s diamond industry. Just last week, Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo was in Antwerp expressing his support at an industry conference. He has repeatedly argued that any diamond ban would hurt Europe more than Moscow.\n\n“For six centuries, Antwerp has proven that it always manages to remain resilient and innovative in turbulent times,” he said in a speech that didn’t mention Russia.\n\nDiamond industry leaders in Antwerp remain confident, even after the renewed debate on sanctions started this week.\n\nOther countries have taken a different approach.\n\n“For six centuries, Antwerp has proven that it always manages to remain resilient and innovative in turbulent times,” said Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo | Paul O'Driscoll/Getty Images\n\nThe U.S. barred the import of “non-industrial” diamonds from Russia shortly after the invasion. It also sanctioned Sergei Sergeevich Ivanov, the chief executive of Russia’s largest diamond mining firm, Alrosa, and his father, Sergei Borisovich Ivanov, a former chief of staff to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe EU has not followed suit.\n\nRoland Papp, who follows illicit financial flows for Transparency International, said the EU was demonstrating “moral hypocrisy” on the subject.\n\n“Over the summer the EU added Russian gold to the sanctions list, it is not too late to add diamonds,” he said.\n\nIn July, the anti-corruption NGO wrote to EU officials urging them to include diamonds in its Russian sanctions regime. Papp said the EU did not respond to the letter.\n\nTom Neys, a spokesperson for the Antwerp World Diamond Center, argued that the diamond business, already under huge pressure from regulators and consumers, organically responds to consumer demands, which currently include ethical and sustainable practices.\n\n“We have invested for 20 years in making the diamond trade more transparent,” said Neys in an interview with POLITICO at the Antwerp conference. “Are we really going to throw that all away to reward Dubai, which is already opening its doors for Russian oligarchs?” he added.\n\nThese arguments have left Ukrainian officials fuming. In April, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy lashed out at Belgian lawmakers in a video appearance before the country’s parliament.\n\n\"There are those for whom Russian diamonds, sometimes sold in Antwerp, are more important,” he said.\n\nA historic bond\n\nAnti-money laundering, tax regulation and greater transparency haven’t come naturally to Antwerp’s diamond traders.\n\nSince the late 1990s, Belgium’s diamond industry has been linked to civil war, armed struggle and corruption across Africa. The world’s first-ever trial against a smuggler of “blood diamonds” from Sierra Leone was held in Antwerp in 2004.\n\nBelgium’s government has long faced criticism for looking the other way.\n\nIn 2008, Human Rights Watch wrote to Belgium’s then-Deputy Prime Minister Didier Reynders, now the EU’s justice commissioner, urging Brussels to crack down on Zimbabwe’s diamond smuggling and the human-rights abuses that accompanied it.\n\nBut NGOs later accused Belgium of doing the opposite and lobbying the EU to lift sanctions on Zimbabwe’s major diamond producer, which it did in 2013, providing a boost for the country’s despotic ruler, Robert Mugabe.\n\nSimilarly, a group of Antwerp-based politicians in the early 2010s known as the “diamond club” were accused of dictating government policy and laws to benefit the industry.\n\nWhen it comes to Russia, then-Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel, now the European Council president, was another advocate for Antwerp’s diamond scene. In January 2018, Michel met Dmitry Medvedev, then Russian premier, in Moscow to discuss business opportunities.\n\n“Our investment cooperation has not come to a standstill,” Michel said at the time, referencing recent EU sanctions on Russia over its annexation of Crimea. “Russian companies have long been working in Antwerp.”\n\nMichel and Reynders declined to comment.\n\nRussia divides diamond industry\n\nSanctions aside, the diamond industry has also split over how to address Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\nSince 2002, the so-called Kimberley Process has been a United Nations-endorsed certification scheme designed to assure consumers and traders that the diamonds they buy are not fuelling wars in Angola, Sierra Leone, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nBut critics say the Kimberley Process fails to address current conflicts, like Russia’s war in Ukraine. Still, Bruce Cleaver, the chief executive of De Beers, told POLITICO his company supports reforming the Kimberley Process instead of eliminating it.\n\n“We think it's an important building block in maintaining consumer confidence that the diamonds they're buying are not conflict diamonds or [had] child labor involved in them,” he said.\n\nReform may be impossible, though. Papp, of Transparency International, said pro-Russian members are resisting pressure to expand the Kimberley Process’s narrow conflict definition, which only covers diamonds financing rebellions seeking to overthrow legitimate governments.\n\nIndeed, at a Kimberley Process meeting in June, members like China, Belarus and the Central African Republic, stopped any debate on the topic.\n\nHans Merket, who covers natural resources for the Antwerp-based IPIS think tank, said the Kimberley Process is struggling to protect consumers from fears they are funding Russia’s conflict in Ukraine.\n\n“It runs the risk of becoming increasingly irrelevant,” he said.\n\nBarbara Moens contributed reporting.",
    "Tanzania’s avocados fetch Sh10,000 apiece in Belgium": "By Bethsheba Wambura More by this Author\n\nDar es Salaam. Tanzania’s avocados fetch premium price in Europe with one fruit selling for more than Sh10,000 in Belgian markets.\n\nThis was said by Tanzania’s ambassador to Belgium, Jestas Nyamanga who encouraged local farmers to sell their avocados to European markets due to the lucrative prices that they fetch\n\n“One avocado is sold for €4 which is more than Sh10, 000 while at home (Tanzania) you can buy avocado at price of Sh500 or Sh1, 000, so now you can see if you export it here you can get a huge profit,\" the envoy said.\n\nAlso Read: Avocados are the new green gold in Tanzania\n\n\n\nPopular avocado varieties produced in Tanzania are Hass, Fuerte, Pinkerton, and, to some extent, Puebla, however the Hass variety is the most popular in European markets.\n\nThe diplomat was speaking live while addressing the journalist through a virtual meeting from Brussels Belgium.\n\nCommercial production of avocados is dominated by Rungwe Avocado Company Ltd and Africado Ltd, which is based in Siha District, Kilimanjaro region. The two companies jointly produce more than 5,000 tonnes per year.\n\nThe rest of the growers are smallholder farmers who own a couple to hundreds of avocado trees around their homesteads and in distant farms.\n\nAlso Read: Tanzania to build Sh3 billion avocado processing plants\n\nThe Tanzania Horticultural Association (TAHA) estimates that the country’s avocado exports reached 11,237 tonnes, or 510 containers worth $33 million in 2021. This is 12.6 percent more compared to 2020 sales.\n\nAccording to the Tanzania Private Sector Foundation (TPSF), in 2018 Tanzania exported 7,551 tons with a total value of USD 8.5 million to Europe, Africa, and Asia.\n\nTAHA projects that Tanzania will export 15,000 tonnes in 2023, thus generating $45 million in foreign currency.\n\nApart from Belgium, other markets with large untapped export potential include Japan, Switzerland, Spain, Germany, the United Arab Emirates, and China, while the potential to export avocado to Africa remains very small.\n\nTanzania’s prominent avocado-producing regions are Mbeya, Njombe, Songwe, and Iringa in the southwest, as well as in Kilimanjaro, Arusha, and Tanga in the northeast of the country, where coffee and tea were once the predominant crop.\n\nAccording to the diplomat, between January and May, 2022 Tanzania’s export to Belgium reached €81.6 million whereas Belgium’s exports to Tanzania stood at €75.2million during the same period.\n\nHowever, he said there is opportunity for this year Tanzania export to Belgium to exceed last year’s volumes which was only €85 million.",
    "Ghent is Belgium’s unsung capital of cool": "Listen 14 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nThe sun beat down on Ghent. It was the hottest day I could remember ever spending in Belgium, and it was a relief to be on the water. I paddled the canoe through the confluence of the Lys and Scheldt rivers. The voices of sunbathers carried from the quay, where moored houseboats bobbed beneath gabled houses and planters popping with pink flowers. But I didn’t dwell on Ghent’s undeniable charm. Instead, I watched the water … until I saw it up ahead, partially submerged: a plastic bottle, riding the currents on its way to the North Sea. I extended my trash-grabber and snatched it.\n\nOver the years, I keep returning to Belgium’s second city. Once I made a pilgrimage to see a world-famous masterpiece, Van Eyck’s “Adoration of the Mystic Lamb,” also called the Ghent Altarpiece. (It’s also known as the most stolen painting in history, but more on that later.) The city’s energy was so irresistible that I’d returned to survey the happening restaurant scene with a friend from Brussels. On each successive trip, I’ve been amazed that Ghent — just about half an hour by train from Bruges and Brussels, and about an hour from Antwerp — isn’t overrun with tourists. Most recently, I wanted to dive into Ghent’s green ethos. Beyond its cool vibe, the city has been making waves for its sustainability initiatives and eco-minded tourism strategy.\n\nSo I boarded a boat by DOKano. The idea behind this nonprofit: Rent a canoe for the price of a bucket of trash that you retrieve yourself from Ghent’s waterways. (A donation is also welcome.) What started in 2017 as the brainchild of five parents at school pickup has morphed into an organization that’s popular with both locals and visitors. DOKano also offers team-building outings and educational excursions with school groups, who are encouraged to sort the trash before nominating the “catch of the day.” Some of the more curious finds? A toy monkey, sneakers and perfectly usable heart-shaped luggage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“DOKano’s mission is to take action with as many people as possible to create plastic-free waters,” says co-founder Hans Marly. “The goal is to remove litter while raising public awareness of the problem.”\n\nThe plight of plastic in our environment can be depressing. For me, going canoeing with DOKano was a means of exploring the beautiful waterways while doing something proactive. “Projects like this are positive for both tourists and locals and reflect the city’s goals,” says Deputy Mayor Bram Van Braeckevelt. “We aim to keep tourism in Ghent sustainable — to find a balance with the city’s livability, to invest in projects that provide a return to the local community, to take measures to avoid overtourism in the future.”\n\nThe rebellious noose bearers\n\nGhent’s vibrant spirit and political engagement stem from its history. The story is told with flair at STAM, the Ghent City Museum, whose very architecture — an amalgam of restored medieval cloisters and contemporary glass — reflects the modern city itself. Back around 630, a wandering French missionary named Amandus arrived to proselytize the local population, building a church that later became St. Bavo’s Abbey. Ghent grew into a medieval powerhouse thanks to the cloth trade. In the oldest written description of Ghent (1154), geographer al-Sharif al-Idrisi waxed poetic in Arabic: “It is a beautiful, flourishing city with many stately homes and grand vistas. It possesses gardens, orchards and fields that provide a continual harvest.”\n\nIn the Middle Ages, Ghent was the second-largest city in northern Europe after Paris. This prosperous trade hub even boasted its own army, with which it challenged the Counts of Flanders and Dukes of Burgundy. Over time, the creation of craft guilds — each demanding political participation — encouraged diplomacy and the exchange of ideas.\n\n“Ghent has always had a rebellious streak,” says Luk Darras, a former Belgian ambassador who has lived here for 17 years, referring to an infamous 16th-century episode. Charles V, the future Holy Roman Emperor, was born in Ghent but later squashed a revolt, forcing the locals to parade through the streets wearing hangman’s nooses around their necks in punishment. To this day, Ghentians are called “stroppendragers” (or noose bearers), and you can find a noose proudly depicted on a local beer label.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, the population numbers more than 265,000 people of about 160 nationalities, with approximately an additional 85,000 university students arriving each autumn. “It brings an injection of youthful energy,” says Mieke Thienpont, a professional guide and president of the Ghent Guides association.\n\n“The city is very much alive,” Darras says. “It’s friendly and dynamic — open to industry and change — and also socially engaged.”\n\nGhent’s heritage is reason enough to travel here. There’s the formidable Castle of the Counts, the 15th-century Great Butchers’ Hall, the UNESCO-listed belfry lording over it all. Founded in 1235, the Beguinage of Our Lady at Hoyen — also a UNESCO site — once housed religious women in a unique, self-sustaining community. Guildhalls with ornately sculpted facades flank the quays of Graslei and Korenlei. The Museum of Fine Arts (MSK), considered Belgium’s oldest museum, is celebrating its 225th anniversary with a rich program. And back to the aforementioned Ghent Altarpiece, of which Darras says is “the one painting you have to see in your life,” a visitor center inside St. Bavo’s Cathedral brings the newly restored work to life through an augmented-reality experience that’s an immersion in the Van Eyck brothers’ world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut besides all this cultural wealth, it’s the energy and ambiance that keep luring me back. As I walked Ghent’s cobblestoned streets, I fed off the laughter from the busy cafes, the rush of commuting bikes, a flamenco concert at ENTR, where I nursed a local Lousberg beer. Admiring the city’s prolific street art, I met local legend Klaas Van der Linden as he painted a wall on Graffiti Street. His works are all over Ghent; for example, the astonishing “Lost at Sea” is an enormous self-portrait in exuberant color. He has a master’s degree in arts, though he learned spray-paint techniques on the streets, and his paintings are exhibited in shows across Europe. A crowd had gathered to snap photos, and Van der Linden was gregarious, inviting some passersby to check out his studio: a medieval cellar with vaulted ceilings that’s quintessentially Ghent.\n\nIt’s this authenticity that the city champions (and promotes through measures such as the “Walk Local” campaign, showing where famous residents hang out to entice visitors away from the city’s Instagrammable historical center). “Ghent is so much more than just a selfie,” Van Braeckevelt says. “We invite people to bring their pajamas and stay overnight — to feel the city’s vibe like Ghentians.”\n\nWhen I checked into the Yalo Urban Boutique Hotel, opened in 2021, I found a buzzing hangout with great energy. It draws locals for coffee and co-working in the morning (the coffee is by a neighborhood roastery called Vandekerckhove), after-work cocktails in the bar (try “Lucifer’s Kiss,” with jalapeño-infused Pisco), and dinner in the glass-roofed atrium (served by friendly waiters wearing white Puma sneakers). A soon-to-open rooftop will no doubt attract the cool crowd for DJ sets with a panoramic view. There’s a real focus on design here, along with sustainability. As Belgium’s second hotel with Green Globe certification, its eco-friendly measures include solar-heated water, upcycled glasses by Belgian company IWAS and kitchen ingredients sourced from local farms.\n\nRevolutionary creativity\n\nA playground for artists, Ghent is fertile ground for experimental ideas, particularly in sustainability. Most recently, the city’s tourism recovery plan, launched in 2021 with a green focus, was the result of diplomacy and compromise. To determine the future of tourism, local residents were engaged alongside business managers in citywide debates.\n\nOther examples abound. The Ghent Light Plan was launched in 2007 as a means of illuminating the city’s monuments and buildings at night in a dazzling yet energy-efficient way. Cycling culture is pervasive, boosted by infrastructure (such as bike parking garages) and city incentives. A low-emission zone was established in January 2020 to keep polluting cars out of the city center. In fact, many locals have ditched their cars in exchange for bikes or community car-sharing services. Ghent was the first Belgian city to launch Fairbnb, the sustainable vacation rental platform that reinvests 50 percent of its revenue in local communities. But perhaps the biggest example of pioneering initiatives: In 2009, Ghent witnessed the launch of “Thursday Veggie Day,” now a global phenomenon that encourages people to skip meat for a day to help fight climate change. Ghent is today a vegetarian capital with a variety of restaurants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We couldn’t have launched anywhere else but Ghent,” says Paul Florizoone, who founded the trendsetting Greenway brand 26 years ago. Before vegetarianism went mainstream, Greenway innovated with meat alternatives, and today, alongside its three restaurants in Belgium, it offers a range of retail products, such as sausage made from locally grown cauliflower and cordon bleu from celeriac. Newer to the scene is Epiphany’s Kitchen, a lively spot named Belgium’s best vegan restaurant by BE Vegan in 2021. You won’t find avocado toast on the menu. The dishes are the result of creative kitchen experimentation — such as the pizza crust made from crushed yuca root — which you can taste among flickering candles and a riot of flowers. Everything is made in-house. “It was a success since the beginning, and I didn’t initially market it as vegan,” explains owner Epiphany Vanderhaeghen. “I wanted to invite people into my world to experience it.”\n\nOn my last night, I sat at the bar at Publiek, a Michelin-starred restaurant with a real cool factor. Chef Olly Ceulenaere is a champion of the Flemish terroir, reputed for exalting local products (whether that be endives, Bintje potatoes or North Sea fish) in refined cuisine that’s also accessible. Appetizing smells wafted from the open kitchen while I slurped an oyster topped with berry-infused granitas, washed down with a rhubarb and raspberry beer. The ambiance is fun and relaxed — the non-harried waiters open to chatting — and it struck me that, with its laid-back style, the restaurant captures the spirit of Ghent. Tipped off by the waiter, I tried the Dame Blanche, a dessert that’s not on the menu. It’s a seemingly simple classic: vanilla ice cream made fresh when you order, accompanied by warm choux pastry and cups of melted chocolate and whipped cream. But it’s sublime because of the quality of the ingredients.\n\n“I want people to have a good time,” Ceulenaere says. “I run the restaurant to be a place where I would want to eat.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was late when I left the restaurant. But the buildings were aglow, the streets humming with cyclists on their way home from a night out. I resolved to return for one of the city’s epic festivals; during the Ghent Light Festival, the gilded dragon that’s perched atop the belfry even spits fire — a fitting mascot for such a spirited place. A light rain began to fall as I followed De Reep, the same waterway I had earlier traversed by canoe. Then the skies above Ghent crackled with the electricity of a thunderstorm.\n\nWinston Nicklin is a writer based in Paris. Her website is marywinstonnicklin.com.

    "Dutch coach Van Gaal insists side will beat Belgium": "Louis van Gaal insisted the Netherlands would beat neighbours Belgium on Sunday to secure top spot in their Nations League group and go into the World Cup unbeaten since he took over as coach.\n\nThe Dutch have a three-point lead at the head of League A Group Four and will win the group as long as they avoid a heavy defeat to Belgium at the Amsterdam Arena on Sunday.\n\n“We’re going to win tomorrow. Better to go to the World Cup undefeated than to lose the last game. That’s what I told the boys,” Van Gaal told a news conference on Saturday.\n\nBelgium, who lost 4-1 to the Dutch in Brussels in June, must win by three goals to snatch top place and advance to next June’s finals tournament.\n\n“If that happens, it will be deserved,” said Van Gaal.\n\n“But I believe in my players and that they will win it. That’s how I prepare them. I don’t expect an upset. My players are always focused and that’s why I always tell them the line-up two days in advance so that they can focus.”\n\nThe Netherlands coach said he did not expect much different from Belgium. “We’ve analysed them and I see a team that always plays with the same concept of the game. I can’t see that Belgium is suddenly doing something different.”\n\nBut he said he was pleased that the Dutch would get a tough test in their last international before the World Cup in Qatar, where they are in Group A with the hosts, Ecuador and Senegal.\n\n“I prefer to play against these kinds of opponents. I am incredibly happy because there are players of the highest quality playing for Belgium,” he said.\n\n“I’ve often said that I think Kevin De Bruyne is fantastic. He dictates the game and also scores goals. How are we going to tackle that? And how do my players react? That is going to be good to see.\n\n“And then there’s the rivalry,” he added. “I think it’s fantastic to play against the Belgians. I’ve mentioned De Bruyne, but they have more. But then so have we.”\n\nIf the Dutch win on Sunday, it will be Van Gaal’s 37th victory in 58 matches in charge and equal Dick Advocaat’s record as the Dutch coach with the most successes.\n\nVan Gaal, 71, has not lost in 14 games since returning for a third spell as Dutch coach last year.",
    "Iran-Belgium prisoner swap: Belgian court to decide on controversial exchange treaty": "\"It's been more than 203 days since I last saw my best friend,\" said Olivier Van Steirtegem as he runs his fingers swiftly across his piano in his home in Brussels, playing a mesmerizing jazz tune. It's a tribute to his friend, Olivier Vandecasteele, who was arrested on February 24 by Iranian authorities on charges of spying.\n\n\"This song I'm playing is 'John Boy' by Brad Mehldau. It was the last one Olivier and I listened to together, before he was arrested by Iran,\" Van Steirtegem, 42, who is the owner of an office furniture store, told DW. \"He is now in complete isolation in a cell and in a poor psychological state. He isn't eating well, has an infection and has lost a lot of weight.\"\n\nVandecasteele, a 41-year-old humanitarian aid worker, had been living and working in Iran since 2015. He had been exploring options to move out of the country and eventually start a new project.\n\n\"But the Iranian authorities had different plans for him,\" said Van Steirtegem.\n\nOlivier Van Steirtegem, right, has started a petition asking the Belgian government to take action to free his friend\n\nFlipping through an album of pictures together, he remembered the fateful day in February when he got the phone call about Vandecasteele's arrest.\n\n\"The neighbors said he was in his apartment in Tehran and was waiting for a pizza delivery. But when his doorbell rang, instead of the pizza delivery person, Iranian authorities forced themselves into his flat and arrested him,\" Van Steirtegem said.\n\n'We are sending a message that we are weak'\n\nIn order to get him released, on July 21, the Belgian government ratified a prisoner exchange treaty with Iran. According to the treaty, Iranians imprisoned in Belgium, would be allowed to serve their sentence in Iran and vice versa.\n\nBut the treaty has been slammed by some members of the Belgian parliament, including some Iranian dissidents, critics of the regime in Teheran, as well as human rights groups who fear that this would lead to the release of Assadollah Assadi — an Iranian diplomat who has been serving a 20-year prison sentence in Belgium for trying to plot a bomb attack on a rally organized by rivals of the Iranian regime, in France in 2018.\n\nThey also say that the accord will give Iran a free pass to continue engaging in terrorism and taking people hostage in Iran and around the world.\n\nBelgian court to decide on prisoner swap deal with Iran\n\n\"If Belgium appeases the regime in Iran in this manner, we are sending across a message that we are weak and are ready to give them what they want,\" Darya Safai an Iranian-Belgian Member of the Belgian Parliament, from the Flemish nationalists party, told DW.\n\n\"I have been imprisoned in Iran myself for fighting for women's rights. I completely understand what Olivier's family is going through. But this is not the only isolated case. There are other European hostages in Iran and we need a better solution to ensure they're all released,\" she said.\n\n'Not fair to keep an innocent man in jail'\n\nVandecasteele was arrested and imprisoned in Iran on espionage charges which the Belgian government says are baseless\n\nBesides Vandecasteele, Swedish-Iranian academic Ahmadreza Dijalali and French tourist Benjamin Briere are some of the other Western nationals being held hostage in Iran.\n\nOut of 131 Belgian parliamentatians, 79 voted in favor of the prisoner-exchange treaty, while 41 rejected it and 11 abstained from voting.\n\nBelgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo acknowledged that it was a tough decision, but said it was not \"blackmail\" and Belgium had to consider the pleas of Vandecasteele's family.\n\n\"What do you say to his family, that we will let him rot in his cell?\" he said in response to criticisms of the treaty.\n\nAccording to AFP, a lawyer representing the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), an Iranian opposition group in exile, said the Brussels appeal court had agreed to cross-examine the case before allowing the swap.\n\nThe court is legally challenging the Belgian government's decision at a hearing that began on September 19.\n\n'Negotiate with force'\n\nPrisoner swaps often takes place between autocracies and democracies where the latter is keen to bring their citizens back home, and the former is keen to use this tactic to achieve their political goals.\n\nExchanges can take place by either exchanging people held captive, or by exchanging money as in the case of British Iranian aid worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, where the UK transferred money to Iran in order to guarantee her release.\n\nBut Belgian parliamentarian Safai believes that prisoner swaps don't work with Iran, and the only true way to negotiate with the country is with force.\n\n\"That is the only language that the Ayatollahs understand. So solutions in the form of sanctions could work better. It is important for the West to take a united stance in confronting Iran. That's the only way that you can ensure security in Europe and stop the process of Iran taking people hostage,\" she told DW.\n\nA man protests outside the Antwerp Criminal Court, during the trial of Iranian diplomat Assadollah Assadi, who was sentenced to prison in Belgium last year for his role in a bomb plot.\n\nAt a press conference in Brussels last week organized by the NCRI, John Bercow, a former British politician who was speaker of the House of Commons, shared a similar view and highlighted that such a prison swap would not prove fruitful in the long run.\n\n\"If you give the beast what the beast wants, then the beast will repeatedly follow the same tactics. We have to look at the wider picture and not just focus on isolated cases,\" he said.\n\nVan Steirtegem understands the complexity of this case since it involves swapping an innocent person in exchange for a terrorist. But he believes it is the only way to get his friend released.\n\n\"I might be biased but I think right now, Olivier needs all the support from the Belgian government. This will also give Belgians the impression that their government cares for innocent people like Olivier,\" he said.\n\nVan Steirtegem has also started a petition asking the Belgian government to enable the prompt release of his friend. More than 25,000 people have signed it so far.\n\nCould the Iranian nuclear deal provide an opportunity?\n\nWhile a final decision is still pending from the court, Roxane Farmanfarmaian, a British lecturer in international politics at the University of Cambridge specializing in Iran, told DW that the Iran nuclear talks could also provide an opportunity for the West to negotiate with the Islamic republic.\n\n\"The Americans have advised Belgium not to proceed with this prison swap since they wish to add on to the nuclear negotiations a larger swap of prisoners, which would involve prisoners from a number of European countries as well as Americans,” she told DW.\n\nThree members of US Congress — Randy K.Weber, Louie Gohmert and Brian Fitzpatrick — have sent a letter to the Belgian prime minister asking him to oppose the treaty.\n\n\"I think Belgium feels as though the time is right and there is no guarantee that the negotiations with the nuclear deal will go through. So they don't want to wait and make their citizens in Tehran wait until something on a larger international scale takes place,\" Farmanfarmaian added.\n\nIrrespective of how the law and politics shape the future of the treaty, Van Steirtegem has not lost hope.\n\n\"I know it is going to be a long fight, but I hope to get a call from the government telling me, okay, listen, everything has been cleared and Olivier will be back before Christmas,\" he said.\n\n\"That's what his family and I are looking forward to right now,\" he added.\n\nEdited by: Sonia Phalnikar",

    "Belgium Business Confidence Plunged in September": "By Maria Martinez\n\nBusiness confidence in Belgium fell sharply in September, declining for the fifth consecutive month amid higher energy prices and weaker demand.\n\nThe business confidence index fell to minus 11.8 in September from minus 5.8 in August, data from the National Bank of Belgium showed Monday. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal expected the indicator to come in at minus 8.8.\n\nThe acute deterioration in the business climate is affecting all sectors of activity covered by the survey, with the exception of the building industry, with the indicator remaining virtually stable, the Bank of Belgium said.\n\nThe loss of confidence was particularly abrupt in the retail sector, with its indicator falling to minus 24.1 in September from minus 11.9 in August. Demand forecasts collapsed and those for orders placed with suppliers fell again.\n\nDemand forecasts in the manufacturing industry were considerably weaker as well. The indicator for this sector declined to minus 13.9 from minus 7.2 in the previous month.\n\nThe economic climate in the services sector is also suffering from much more unfavorable forecasts concerning both firms' own activity and general market demand. The indicator for the sector deteriorated to minus 4.5 in September from 2.1 in August.\n\nIn the building industry, the indicator remained more or less stable, falling to minus 6.0 from minus 5.6, with demand forecasts even improving. However, business leaders were less optimistic about the level of their order books.\n\nWrite to Maria Martinez at maria.martinez@wsj.com",

    "Migrant smugglers using private aircrafts grounded in Belgium and Italy": "Supported by Eurojust and Europol, judicial and law enforcement authorities in Austria, Belgium, Germany, France, Italy and the United States dismantled a criminal network involved in migrant smuggling, document fraud and money laundering.\n\n© Belgian authorities\n\nUp to EUR 20 000 for a place in private aircraft\n\nThe migrants, mainly Iraqi and Iranian of Kurdish origin, boarded private aircrafts in Türkiye carrying false diplomatic passports. However, the official destinations of the trips (usually the Caribbean) were never reached. During the stopovers at different European airports, including in Austria, France and Germany, the migrants left the plane, disposed of their false passports and systematically applied for asylum. The suspects charged up to EUR 20 000 per smuggled person.\n\nIt is believed that, between October and December 2020, at least five smuggling operations took place in five different European countries. In addition, several plans were made to carry out other smuggling operations. In addition to migrant smuggling and forging identity documents, the organised crime group is also suspected of issuing false checks and scamming airlines in an attempt to build its own fleet. The suspects also allegedly defrauded hotels by not paying the invoices.\n\nThe action day on 13 September led to:\n\n5 arrests (2 in Belgium and 3 in Italy)\n\n7 house searches (1 in Belgium and 6 in Italy)\n\nSeizures of 2 aircrafts, EUR 80 000 EUR cash, 1 high–end car, electronic equipment and equipment to forge ID documents (card printers, stamps, holograms and white plastic cards)\n\nEUR 173 000 EUR frozen in Italy\n\nEurojust supported the authorities involved with the setting up and funding of a joint investigation team (JIT) in June 2021. The Agency also hosted four coordination meetings to facilitate judicial cooperation and provide support for the coordinated investigative efforts.\n\nEuropol prioritised the case at an early stage, assigning a dedicated analyst and specialist to support the national investigations to identify the members of the criminal network and to dismantle it. Europol facilitated the operational information exchange and provided analytical and financial support. On the action day, Europol activated a Virtual Command Post to facilitate the information exchange in real time. Europol also deployed three analysts – one to Belgium and two to Italy – to cross-check operational information against Europol’s databases and thus provided further investigative leads to the participating national law enforcement authorities.\n\nLaw enforcement authorities involved:\n\nAustria : Criminal Intelligence Service Austria (Bundeskriminalamt), Provincial CID of Tyrol (Landeskriminalamt Tirol) and Schwechat City Command of the Federal Police (Stadtpolizeikommando Schwechat)\n\n: Criminal Intelligence Service Austria (Bundeskriminalamt), Provincial CID of Tyrol (Landeskriminalamt Tirol) and Schwechat City Command of the Federal Police (Stadtpolizeikommando Schwechat) Belgium : Belgian Federal Police (Federale Politie, Police Fédérale), Aviation Police Wevelgem\n\n: Belgian Federal Police (Federale Politie, Police Fédérale), Aviation Police Wevelgem France : French Border Police (OCRIEST/Police Aux Frontières)\n\n: French Border Police (OCRIEST/Police Aux Frontières) Germany : German Federal Police Munich Airport\n\n: German Federal Police Munich Airport Italy : National Police (Polizia di Stato: Servizio Centrale Operativo, Squadra Mobile di Bari e Roma, Servizio di Polizia Scientifica and Ufficio di Polizia di Frontiera di Bari)\n\n: National Police (Polizia di Stato: Servizio Centrale Operativo, Squadra Mobile di Bari e Roma, Servizio di Polizia Scientifica and Ufficio di Polizia di Frontiera di Bari) United States: U.S. Homeland Security Investigations, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Diplomatic Security Service.\n\nJudicial authorities involved:",

A bio-rotor functions as a water purification plant. A bicycle path has also been built. These facilities are intended to help the company reach its target to emit approximately 30% less CO2 by 2030; by 2040, it wants to have reduced its climate gas emissions by 90%.\n\nDPD BeLux now has two international hubs – one in Oirschot in the Netherlands, which serves Northern Europe and the UK, and the new hub in Vilvoorde, which supports Belgium. In Belgium and Luxembourg, DPD BeLux now has one hub and eight depots from which a fleet of over 1,000 vehicles operates. The company provides work for around 1,500 families.\n\nRichard de Haas, CEO of DPD BeLux, said, “Our ambition is to become the international reference for sustainable parcel delivery. We will put even more emphasis on international growth, innovation and the transformation required by the current market. The figures show that e-commerce continues to grow and that the potential of the Belgian and Luxembourg market is significant. During the Covid-19 pandemic, thanks to our strengths in the B2C [business-to-consumer] segment, we had additional opportunities and made our mark on the market. With the new depots and our new hub, we are absolutely ready for the future.”\n\nHans Bonte, the Mayor of Vilvoorde, added, “As a city, we are extremely pleased with the arrival of DPD BeLux. As an important player in the ‘new economy’, the company is fully committed to sustainability and climate-friendly entrepreneurship. Without exaggeration, the new hub can be considered a leader for many other companies in our region. Moreover, the company is a boon to our labor market. On the one hand, Vilvoorde has an exceptionally high number of hard-to-fill vacancies. On the other hand, the city has a high level of structural unemployment among relatively unskilled people. This opportunity makes the situation a win-win situation. In any case, the city council is ready to determine, together with the VDAB [the Flemish Service for Employment and Vocational Training]and DPD, how we can mutually combine our efforts.”",

    "Belgium’s Catholic Church: shrinking but still influential": "The Catholic Church in Belgium is dominating headlines this week, after bishops issued a text for the blessing of same-sex couples.\n\nBut it’s not only this week that the country has garnered attention in Catholic circles — Belgian Catholicism has long enjoyed considerable influence within the worldwide Church, especially since the Second Vatican Council.\n\nAnd yet Belgium only ranks in 28th place on the list of countries with the largest Catholic populations, behind the Dominican Republic and Kenya.\n\nSo why does the country continue to drive Catholic news? The Pillar takes a look.\n\nCardinal Suenens. Polla ta deina via Wikimedia (CC BY-SA 4.0).\n\nA cardinal, the Council, and co-responsibility\n\nBelgium is not an easy country to understand. For centuries, this strategic strip of land was the “battlefield of Europe.” The nation, which declared its independence from the Netherlands in 1830, is composed of two major ethnic groups: the majority Flemish people, who speak a Dutch dialect, and the minority French-speaking Walloons.\n\nBelgium has a population of 11.5 million and borders the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and France. Its capital, Brussels, is the center of the European Union, a political and economic alliance of 27 member states. The country is relatively prosperous, but outsiders often regard it as deeply culturally divided and its government as dysfunctional, dubbing it “the world’s most successful failed state.”\n\nBelgium also has a bleak colonial legacy: King Leopold II had a reign of terror in the Congo Free State from 1885 to 1908 (inspiring Joseph Conrad’s novel “Heart of Darkness.”) As late as 1958, Belgium hosted a “human zoo,” featuring Congolese men, women and children.\n\nIt is often said there are no famous Belgians, but in fact the country has produced storied saints such as St. John Berchmans and St. Damien of Molokai.\n\nShortly after Belgium gained independence, an important center of Catholic scholarship was established in the city of Leuven/Louvain. (The city’s Catholic university split in the 1960s along linguistic lines, leading to the collapse of the Belgian government.)\n\nThe Belgian Church’s academic prowess proved influential when Pope John XXIII summoned the world’s bishops to Rome for an Ecumenical Council in 1962. Belgian theologians and bishops contributed vigorously to Vatican II’s sessions, none more so than Cardinal Leo Jozef Suenens.\n\nAccording to his New York Times obituary, Suenens helped to influence the Council’s direction when he sent a critique of its preparatory documents to the pope. With John XXIII’s support, the cardinal presented an alternative vision at the Council’s first session. The pope then appointed Suenens to a commission that streamlined the Council’s agenda. Paul VI later named him one of the Council’s four moderators.\n\nThe New York Times described Suenens as a champion of the “modernization of the garb and life style of Catholic nuns, expansion of the laity’s responsibilities, ordination of married men to serve as deacons, mandatory retirement for bishops and renewed ties with other branches of Christianity and with Judaism.”\n\nA few years after Vatican II, Suenens published a widely discussed book arguing that the Vatican was backsliding on the Council’s commitment to “co-responsibility of the laity.”\n\nA funeral Mass in Transinne, Belgium. Lucyin via Wikimedia (CC BY-SA 4.0).\n\nGood works, small congregations\n\nThe annual report produced by the Belgian Church is a colorful, glossy publication running to 100 pages. With its quirky pictures of young people and pages highlighting charitable works, the report suggests that Belgian Catholicism is alive and well.\n\nBut midway through, there is a statistical section. And there, the picture begins to darken. The report notes that 1,261 people asked to be removed from baptismal registers in 2020. That year, 33 parishes were closed and 17 churches fell into disuse (with two given to other Christian communities.)\n\nThere were just four priestly ordinations in the country, while three diocesan priests left the ministry. More than half of Belgium’s remaining diocesan priests are over 75 years of age.\n\nUnderstandably, the report does not give Mass attendance figures, as churches were closed for much of the pandemic year. But the previous year’s report recorded that a total of 241,029 people attended Mass on the third Sunday of October in 2019.\n\nSo around 3.6% of Belgium’s baptized Catholics attended Mass on an average Sunday. Compare that to 1967 — at the height of Suenens’ influence — when 42.9% of the country’s Catholics were present at Sunday Mass.\n\nIn short, the statistics suggest that, despite its good works, the Church in Belgium is suffering severe attrition.\n\nArchbishop André-Joseph Léonard in February 2012. Marek Blahuš via Wikimedia (CC BY-SA 3.0).\n\nThe battle for Brussels\n\nCardinal Suenens was the first churchman to lead the Archdiocese of Mechelen-Brussels (which was known as the Archdiocese of Mechelen until 1961). He was succeeded in 1979 by another influential prelate, Cardinal Godfried Danneels.\n\nA leader of the European Church’s liberal wing, Danneels took part in meetings of the St. Gallen Group, an informal circle of prelates who believed that the reforming spirit of the Second Vatican Council had been stifled.\n\nDanneels’ reputation was tarnished in 2010 by a leaked audio recording, in which he urged a young man not to publicly accuse his uncle, Bishop Roger Vangheluwe of Bruges, of sexually abusing him.\n\nThe disclosure was followed by an independent report which recorded 475 abuse complaints against clergy and church workers from the 1950s to the 1980s. The abuse crisis severely dented Belgian Catholicism’s reputation and strained relations between Belgian authorities and the Vatican.\n\nDanneels took part in the 2013 conclave that elected Pope Francis, appearing alongside the new pope on the loggia overlooking St. Peter’s Square. The pope named him a participant in the 2015 family synod in Rome.\n\nDanneels had retired as archbishop of Mechelen-Brussels in 2010. He was succeeded by the conservative Archbishop André-Joseph Léonard, marking a clear break in the see’s progressivist tradition.\n\nLéonard’s appointment was so controversial that Archbishop Karl-Josef Rauber, the former apostolic nuncio to Belgium, took the rare step of denouncing it. The Vatican diplomat said publicly that he would have preferred Danneels’ successor be an auxiliary bishop of Mechelen-Brussels.\n\nPope Francis accepted Léonard’s resignation, after a turbulent tenure, shortly after his 75th birthday in 2015. The pope chose Bishop Jozef De Kesel — a former auxiliary bishop under Danneels — as Léonard’s successor and soon made him a cardinal. In 2015, he also gave Rauber the red hat.\n\nThis year, Pope Francis named another Belgian to the College of Cardinals: Bishop Lucas Van Looy. But the 80-year-old emeritus bishop of Ghent asked to be withdrawn from consideration following criticism that he had failed to provide sufficient support for abuse victims.\n\nCardinal Jozef De Kesel. Philcotof via Wikimedia (CC BY-SA 4.0).\n\nContinuity or change?\n\nPope Francis’ intervention in 2015 helped to restore progressivist continuity in the Archdiocese of Mechelen-Brussels, Belgium’s primatial see. It is not surprising that its current incumbent, Cardinal De Kesel, was the driving force behind the Flemish bishops’ document allowing for blessings of same-sex couples.\n\nThe pope has not yet responded to the text, which appears to challenge last year’s declaration by the Vatican’s doctrinal department that the Church has no power to bless same-sex unions. He may never comment publicly on the document. But he will soon face a choice that will indicate his thoughts.\n\nDe Kesel, the Primate of Belgium and president of the Belgian bishops’ conference, submitted his resignation as archbishop of Mechelen-Brussels on his 75th birthday in June.\n\nThe weekly newspaper Katholiek Nieuwsblad reported that it was “an open secret” that De Kesel was not “pushing for further extension of his episcopate in Mechelen-Brussels.”\n\n“He was diagnosed with colon cancer in spring 2020 and the treatment and an operation in summer 2020 have taken their toll. The cardinal has recovered but remains weakened,” it said.\n\nThe paper speculated that De Kesel would remain in post “at least until the ad limina visit of the Belgian bishops,” scheduled for Nov. 21-26.\n\nIt seems that the pope must decide imminently whether to select De Kesel’s successor from among the Flemish bishops who collectively endorsed the new document or to go outside their circle.\n\nHis choice will send an important signal about the future of Belgian Catholicism.",

    "Is pedigree important when buying a dog in Belgium?": "Credit: Eric Lalmand/Belga.\n\nWhen you make the decision to get a dog, you quickly realise that the budget can be variable depending on the pedigree of the dog.\n\nIn Belgium, the Royal Society of Saint Hubert is responsible for improving the quality of dog breeding in this country. Founded in 1882, the society awards 25,000 pedigrees per year and controls the work of 2500 amateur and professional breeders.\n\nA year after its foundation, the society opened the Livre des Origines Saint-Hubert or L.O.S.H, the directory of all purebred dogs born in Belgium and the year of its their registry as a pedigree breed. It is the only officially recognised dog directory in Belgium.\n\nBut what exactly is a pedigree?\n\nThe pedigree L.O.S.H. is, in a way, the birth certificate of a dog and its identity card; it attests to the ancestry of the dog over three registered generations, becoming essentially a purebred family tree.\n\nThe purity of the ancestry remains the unique guarantee of the preservation of the natural qualities both physical and behavioural of the breed fixed by conscientious breeding.\n\nBad selections can sometimes lead to the appearance of defects that jeopardise the quality of the canine breed. To date, L.O.S.H. pedigree dogs represent less than 20% of the approximately 1,500,000 dogs in Belgium.\n\nRelated News\n\nBut in the world of breeding, the pedigree makes it possible not only to guarantee the acquisition of a dog in the best conditions but also the well-being of the breeding, registered breeders can only produce two litters over two years from the same dog.\n\nBeware the dog\n\nWhile the pedigree gives information on the origins of the dog, and on its ancestry, it does not constitute a certificate of good health and does not give you a guarantee on the behaviour of the dog.\n\nHaving a dog with pedigree is never more than a guarantee of reproduction. If the goal is bringing a balanced, good-natured dog into the family, the pedigree is not the Holy Grail.\n\nShelters in particular are full of dogs awaiting adoption, while some small family breeders that do not necessarily deliver the pedigree will be able to give you puppies raised in good conditions, which are well socialised, identified and vaccinated as the legislation requires.\n\nThe choice of the dog will be based above all on the expectations of the family and this stage of reflection is very important; how much time you have for the dog, the space you can offer it, and the composition of the family are crucial elements to consider when you select the type of dog for your home.\n\nOnce you are fixed on these criteria, you are free to choose the sector that suits you: a recognised breeding, a family breeding, or a refuge.\n\nAdditional tips\n\nKeep in mind that one or two visits to the future puppy are essential to get an idea of its environment, and the hygiene of the place. Do not forget that the sale of animals via social networks is currently totally prohibited.\n\nFinally, do not hesitate to take advice from your future veterinarian or your assigned veterinarian if you already have one. The selection of the puppy is a very important decision that will bind you to it for many years.",

    "Belgium in Brief: Should strikes be a fundamental right?": "Credit: Belga\n\nSo often portrayed as a nuisance, strikes are disruptive by nature but also a vital tool to protect worker conditions. Whilst politicians and loyal media are quick to write them off as collective action going too far, they are almost always a final resort only used when diplomatic efforts have been exhausted.\n\nStrikes can also serve as a reminder of how vital some sectors are to keeping civil life running smoothly. We rarely pay any attention to public services until they stop working. For all the reasons given not to tax company profits (think of claims that it stifles innovation), strikes shine a light on who really keeps the machines running.\n\nWhen was the last time you saw business executives go on strike? The Irish bank strikes of the '60s and '70s provide an isolated example of the financial sector taking this form of action. Yet the strikes had little effect on the nation's economic activity and daily life continued.\n\nNonetheless, industrial action can be a vital lever to bring meaningful change to the lives of those we depend on most. And yet a new EU directive could undermine or remove this fundamental right by outlawing strikes when they might hinder the functioning of the single market in certain emergency situations.\n\nThough lawmakers deny that this is the intention, the proposed Single Market Emergency Instrument has conspicuously left out the text that enshrines the right to strike in law. Trade Unions have been quick to point out the omission and have urged the European Commission to amend the text to ensure that fundamental rights are not sacrificed to commercial interests.\n\nWith trade unions in Belgium holding the third national strike this year over the lack of government measures to tackle the cost of living crisis, public opinion about strikes might be split.\n\nShould industrial action be a fundamental right or should we impose conditions?

    "Projects in Walloon, Belgium point to a future of biomass as an energy source": "The cost of energy is historically high in Belgium and, to add to the problem, fossil fuels are becoming scarcer as we consume them. To adapt, farmers in Wallonia are developing more sustainable and local alternatives, reported Brussels Times One alternative to fossil fuels is biomethanation which consists of the degradation of biomass, such as manure from a livestock farm or organic waste from an agri-food plant. The biomass is heated in a tank to become biogas, which is composed of 60% methane and 40% carbon dioxide. This biogas is then purified in order to isolate methane as energy.Simply put, organic matter is recycled to transform it into a source of energy, such as heating systems and compressed natural gas (or CNG, fuel for motor vehicles.)Farmers are able to use the organic matter produced by their livestock to transform it into biomethane (renewable natural gas) to heat farm buildings or sell CNG.The first Walloon biomethanation site was inaugurated in 2020 in Fleurus, Hainaut, and already produces 100,000 tons of output each year.This idea of \"energy community\" also appeals to those on the side of public authorities, such as the municipality of Dour in the province of Hainaut, which hopes to use the biomass from their citizens to produce gas by 2024.The equivalent of one ton of organic waste from households in the municipality would be converted into a product that will either be gas for the network or made into CNG for vehicles.Wallonia has a high potential of 8.7 Tw/h in terms of biomethane and other studies even suggest the figure could go up to 15 Tw/h. This would represent 10% of the annual gas consumption in Belgium.Many believe this alternative energy source has a future in Belgium, even if the costs of installing the equipment necessary for the process are high and will require investors, private or public.",
    "Belgium Tourism Gradually Recovering From COVID-19 Damages": "Belgian residents are travelling more often compared to the period when the spread of the Coronavirus and its new variants reached its peak, according to the recent report provided by Travel and Tour.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThis means that the tourism sector in Belgium is marking a notable improvement, despite the fact that some transformed patterns in travelling and tourism can be noticed among Belgians, SchengenVisaInfo.com reports.\n\nDue to the spread of the Coronavirus and its new strains, government in the majority of countries worldwide kept in place strict entry rules and imposed travel bans in order to contain the virus’ further spread; however, the easing of the restrictions by authorities in Belgium as well as those in countries worldwide has led to an increase in the travel demand and also has notably improved the tourism sector.\n\nIn this regard, the CEO of Tourism Flanders, Peter De Wilde, stressed that he has seen how many difficulties tourist entrepreneurs faced, being subject to significant difficulties during the pandemic, but still, despite all odds, they never gave up and are now experiencing a lot of passengers from home as well as those from other countries to appreciate all the resources that make Flanders such as an exclusive tourist destination.\n\nRecently, the Belgian statistical office, StatBel, said that the number of overnight stays spent in Belgian tourist accommodations rose to 3,871,283 in April this year.\n\nIn addition, the same revealed that the majority of overnight stays were in hotels, or 41 per cent, followed by holiday homes as well as apartments (20 per cent) and holiday centres and villages (14 per cent).\n\nStateBel figures reveal that the number of overnight stays in April this year increased by a total of 120 per cent compared to the same period last year’s figures and by 8,614 per cent compared to April 2020, still below in comparison to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nIn the recent report provided by Antwerp airport, it was confirmed that nearly 81,705 passengers travelled through this airport in Belgium in the second quarter of this year.\n\n“Business travel and private aviation at Antwerp Airport are also flourishing.

    "Teleworkers more than double in four years in Belgium": "Teleworking is growing in Belgium and impacts mobility habits, FPS Mobility and Transport explained in a press release published on Monday based on a survey of 1,250 Belgian workers between June and July this year.\n\nIn four years, the share of teleworkers has more than doubled. In 2018, 17% of Belgians were teleworking at least one day a week compared to 32% today, a trend that has primarily been driven by COVID-19 measures, the press release stated.\n\nBrussels residents telework the most regularly, with 43% of respondents teleworking at least once a week, compared to 28% in Wallonia and 33% in Flanders.\n\nOn the mobility side, the survey notes that, in 2022, 35 million kilometres travelled each day were avoided thanks to teleworking, of which 14 million kilometres would have been done by car. Results also highlighted that the proportion of teleworkers increased based on the distance between their homes and workplace.\n\nOver 50% of responders who live farther than 50 km from their workplace telework at least once a week.\n\nTeleworking has also changed the modes of transport workers use, shifting to more sustainable modes of transport like cycling and riding trains which are more prevalent (61%) among teleworkers than non-teleworkers (40%).\n\nAnother positive aspect of mobility is that teleworking allows for the distribution of trips throughout the day or the week. Trips for shopping and services increase on teleworking days (28%) or are made during the week and the day rather than in the evening, during weekends or holidays (32%).\n\nTeleworking has allowed for a reduction in the number of vehicles on the road, which has a direct impact on road safety. According to estimates by the Vias Institute, in 2021, with teleworking, the number of traffic fatalities was reduced by 35, the number of severe injuries by 242, and more than 3,000 accidents leading to death or injuries have also been avoided.\n\nThe FPS aims to continue to promote teleworking to achieve the objectives of a 50% reduction in road deaths by 2030 and zero deaths by 2050 set in the “All for Zero” road safety plan.\n\n(Anne-Sophie Gayet | EURACTIV.com)",

    "Bishops in Belgium authorize prayer for committed gay couples": "BRUSSELS (CNS) — The Flemish-speaking bishops of Belgium have appointed a contact person for ministry to and with gay Catholics and have authorized prayer for committed gay couples on the condition it is clear that it is not equivalent to a wedding blessing.\n\nThe document, “Being pastorally close to homosexual persons: For a welcoming church that excludes no one,” was dated Sept. 20 and posted on the website of the Belgian bishops.\n\nThe Flemish bishops include Cardinal Josef De Kesel of Mechelen-Brussels, Bishop Johan Bonny of Antwerp, Bishop Lodewijk Aerts of Bruges, Bishop Lode Van Hecke of Ghent and Bishop Patrick Hoogmartens of Hasselt.\n\nThe document concludes with a sample “Prayer for love and faithfulness.”\n\n“During pastoral meetings,” the bishops said, “the request is often made for a moment of prayer to ask that God bless and make endure their commitment of love and fidelity.”\n\nThe “concrete content and form” of the prayer “is best discussed by those involved and a pastoral leader,” the bishops said. The prayer should take place “in all simplicity” and “the difference should remain clear between that and what the church understands by a sacramental marriage.”\n\nThe sample “moment of prayer” in the document included a Scripture reading and words by the couple expressing their desire for God to strengthen their union and help them be always faithful to each other.\n\nIt also included the possibility of a “prayer of the community” that “God’s grace may work in them to care for each another and for the broader community in which they live” and would end with a blessing, although the document did not specify whether it was a general blessing for everyone present or a blessing of the couple.\n\nThe then-Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, in a March 2021 response to questions, said the Catholic Church “does not have, and cannot have, the power to bless” same-sex unions.\n\n“It is not licit to impart a blessing on relationships, or partnerships, even stable, that involve sexual activity outside of marriage” between a man and a woman “as is the case of the unions between persons of the same sex,” the congregation said, adding that Pope Francis approved the response.\n\nTo bless same-sex unions would serve “to approve and encourage a choice and a way of life that cannot be recognized as objectively ordered to the revealed plans of God,” the doctrinal office said.\n\nThe Vatican press office had no comment when asked about the Belgian bishops’ statement Sept. 20.\n\nThe Flemish bishops said their pastoral approach in ministry to and with gay Catholics is one of “encounter and conversation.”\n\n“Believers who are in a stable homosexual relationship desire respect and appreciation,” they said. “It hurts when they feel that they do not belong or are excluded.”\n\nThe church in Belgian, the bishops said, has been trying for years “to create a climate of respect, recognition and integration” and to welcome the participation in church life of LGBTQ Catholics. To give that commitment a more formal pastoral structure, they said, they have appointed Willy Bombeek to lead a special office within the Interdiocesan Family Pastoral Service and have asked each diocese to make a similar appointment.\n\n“Let’s be clear: We are not talking about marriage. It’s not a marriage. In the Catholic tradition, marriage is between a man and a woman,” Bombeek told Catholic News Service in Rome Sept. 21. “But the Flemish bishops sensed that there was a need, that in the community — from the Catholic LGBT community and their families — that there was a need for a recognition of their union.”\n\nGay and lesbian couples can marry civilly in Belgium, he said, but many Catholic couples also wanted a moment of prayer with their families in a Catholic church or chapel to pray for God’s grace.\n\n“The bishops listened,” he said.\n\nThe sample text of a prayer for “love and fidelity,” Bombeek said, asks that God “may bless and confirm their commitment” to each other.\n\n“It is explicitly not a marriage,” he said. “We are not in conflict with the Vatican. We are loyal.”\n\n“I have received so many notes from gay people,” he said. They welcome the document as “a message of hope” and an affirmation that they are children of God and members of the Catholic community.\n\nGeert De Kerpel, spokesperson for the Flemish bishops, also told CNS Sept. 21 that the document was not issued “in defiance” of the Vatican’s doctrinal office. “I have told that to the many journalists who contacted me again and again, but apparently in vain with most of them.”\n\n– – –\n\nContributing to this story was Cindy Wooden in Rome.",
    "Special Village to Be Built in Belgium for Ukrainian Refugees": "The city of Ghent in Belgium has announced that it will start building a village for Ukrainian refugees who settled in the country because of the war.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAccording to Ghent city authorities, the project is planned to be implemented in the first quarter of 2023, SchengenVisaInfo.com reports.\n\nThe data provided by the United Nations Agency Refugee revealed that from the beginning of the war in Ukraine on February 24 until August 16, more than 52,000 Ukrainians arrived in Belgium. Meanwhile, according to the Ghent city government, only 332 refugees were registered in Ghent, to whom local residents gave shelter.\n\nIn this regard, the city government has emphasized that this is the reason for starting the construction of a special village closer to the city’s outskirts so that it could easily accommodate many people.\n\nAt the same time, it was reported by the city authorities that the construction process is planned to start already in September and to prepare at least 200 housing units to accommodate 600 people.\n\nMoreover, the Flemish government will be an active part regarding organizational, financial and construction issues so that the solution to the problem is effective and fast.\n\nPreviously, Belgium, Italy, and Luxembourg have received an additional €433.79 million from the European Commission for supporting people fleeing the war in Ukraine, their employment, and health care.\n\nAs the EU Commission explains, Belgium, with the amount of €33.4 million from the European Social Fund (ESF), would increase orientation, counselling, and employment support.\n\nIn addition, in May, the EU Commission announced that refugees from Ukraine who have moved to Belgium now and have temporary protection are allowed access to the labour market and various social benefits.\n\nThe Commission also pointed out that refugees must undertake essential administrative procedures, including opening a bank account.\n\nAccording to the Commission, in May, about 30,000 refugees from Ukraine were registered at the Federal Agency for the Reception of Asylum Seekers (Fedasil) in Belgium. Meanwhile, the data showed that more than 40 per cent of those refugees are minors, and 37 per cent are of school age.\n\nSeveral EU countries are facing with shortage of accommodation for Ukrainian refugees due to their large influx. In Germany, the authorities have announced that childcare centres, schools, and health care have expressed concern about this situation.\n\nCommenting on this situation, the head of the Landkreistag (Association of Districts), Reinhard Sager, has also added that many districts in Germany have already reached the limits of their capacity to accept more refugees coming from Ukraine.",

    "Belgium calls for price cap on all gas EU imports, not only from Russia": "Gas is switched on a gas cooking range in a private home in Sint-Pieters-Leeuw, Belgium February 15, 2022. REUTERS/Yves Herman\n\nBRUSSELS, Sept 8 (Reuters) - European consumers need a cap on wholesale gas prices rather than just a \"political\" one on Russian imports, Belgium's Energy Minister Tinne Van der Straeten told Reuters on Thursday.\n\nSpeaking ahead of emergency European Union talks aimed at lowering runaway energy prices on Friday, Van der Straeten said Belgium wants an EU-wide, dynamic price cap on exchange traded gas linked to Asian markets to ensure security of supplies.\n\nThe price cap on Russian pipeline gas imports, proposed by the EU executive ahead of Friday's ministerial talks, has so far had a mixed reception among the bloc's 27 nations. read more\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nEuropean power prices have risen sharply up since economies began to emerge from the COVID-19 crisis last year, with the increase fuelled by Russia cutting gas supplies in retaliation for Western sanctions imposed over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"Our intention first and foremost is to bring prices down. A cap on only Russian gas won't bring prices down,\" Van der Straeten said. \"A cap on just Russian gas is purely political.\"\n\n\"There is not that much Russian gas coming to Europe, so I don't see the added value of that,\" the Green Belgian politician said, adding that Spain, Poland and Luxembourg were in favour of a cap, while Germany had reservations.\n\n\"We have to intervene at wholesale market level... so that it can have effect on energy bills,\" she said, adding the cap should be monitored closely and have a back-up mechanism in place for when global LNG prices break the EU ceiling.\n\nThe Netherlands, traditionally against market interventions, backed the narrower, Russia-only option.\n\nVan der Straeten said energy ministers should give clear guidance to the European Commission to act to cut energy prices, and that the cap could then take effect in a matter of days.\n\n\"It's absolutely our intention to have this (in place) before winter heating really starts,\" she said, adding the measure to bring down prices should take effect in October.\n\nShe said joint EU gas purchases must be brought forward and that the bloc needed an energy market price reform that would split electricity produced from gas from that coming from non-fossil sources like nuclear power or renewables.\n\nFor the time being, tapping into windfall profits made by energy companies - as proposed by the Commission - was acceptable as it would give EU countries money for direct support for those struggling with high energy bills.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nReporting by Gabriela Baczynska; Editing by Carmel Crimmins and Alexander Smith\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

    "Belgium’s secret princess, Delphine, reveals why she took her royal father, former King Albert to court": "Two years after she was named as a princess of Belgium, Delphine of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha insists that the title has not gone to her head.\n\n“Princes and kings never impressed me,” she says. “I never, ever dreamed of becoming a princess. But I knew that if I didn’t do something, I was always going to be known as the bastard.”\n\nDelphine is finally speaking out after winning her legal case against her father, Belgium’s former king, Albert II, who refused to admit that the “secret princess” was the result of his 18-year, extramarital affair with her mother.\n\nIt was only in January 2020, after a court-ordered DNA test proved he was her biological father, that Albert – who had abdicated the throne by then – acknowledged Delphine as his love child. A few months later, she was formally accorded the right to the title of princess and a royal surname: Delphine Boël became Delphine of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.\n\nThe 54-year-old artist, who studied at Chelsea College of Arts in London, is candid about her long ordeal to be recognised as the king’s daughter.\n\nFrom an early age, Delphine knew who her biological father was. Albert, who she nicknamed “papillon”, or butterfly, was a constant presence in her childhood, even taking her on holiday.\n\nHer mother, Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps, was married to industrialist Jacques Boël. Albert was seen as a playboy prince but was married to Paola, a glamorous Italian aristocrat. Albert’s elder brother, Baudouin, was king at the time of the affair.\n\n“My mother thought she couldn’t have children,” Delphine says. “She had nine miscarriages with Jacques. And then she started seeing Albert. She was separated from Jacques but still officially married to him.” The outside world did not know the truth, even after Albert was crowned King in 1993.\n\nThe story only became publicly known in 1999. “And then it all went bonkers,” Delphine says. At the time, she was in London, where she had spent most of her life. “I suddenly found myself a bit like in the movie Notting Hill, with paparazzi all over.”\n\nShe initially remained in contact with Albert, who reassured her that it would blow over. But in 2001, his tone changed: he told Delphine he wasn’t her father and broke off their contact, leaving her in a state of shock.\n\nIt was only a few years later, when Delphine had children of her own, that she began to question her father’s behaviour. “I started to think, ‘This is not normal.’ I also wondered whether this would carry on, and what would happen to my children. What’s going to happen to them when they’re older? Are they always going to question who their mother’s father was?”\n\nBelgium’s Princess Delphine with her family, Oscar O’Hare and Josephine O’Hare, at the wedding service of Princess Maria Laura of Belgium and William Isvy at the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula in Brussels (Photo: Johanna Geron/Reuters)\n\nShe eventually launched a legal action to secure her recognition in 2012, but it dragged on for years. Albert continued to deny his paternity, but when he stepped down from the Belgian throne in 2013 in favour of his son, Philippe, he lost his legal immunity. In 2019, a court eventually ordered him to provide a DNA sample, or face a fine of €5,000 (£4400) for every day that he refused.\n\nAfter the test came back positive, Albert grudgingly admitted he was Delphine’s father. A later court ruling granted her the same rights and titles as her father’s legitimate children – while her children were recognised as princess and prince with the style of Their Royal Highness. “Sometimes in life, you have to go through the muck,” she says. “Sometimes, there will be horrible moments. But you need to get through them.”\n\nShe also takes pride in breaking taboos about children born out of wedlock, who now outnumber those from married couples in Belgium. “Or if you have a bastard child, or if you have children from a first marriage that you don’t want to hear anything about anymore,” she adds.\n\nDelphine is adamant that she wants to continue her day job as an artist. “I’m very happy that I have had a whole career behind me. That was also very important for me to prove myself before anything like this could ever happen,” she says. Next month, she has an exhibition in Saint-Tropez featuring massive paintings with slogans such as ‘Everything is going to be fine’, wrapped in heavy gold picture frames.\n\nPrincess Delphine with one of her artworks in a photo taken by her husband, Jim O’Hare (PHOTO: Jim O’Hare)\n\nShe has also used her platform to support her favourite causes, including the Make-A-Wish Foundation, which was her chosen charity last year when she took part in a celebrity edition of Belgium’s Dancing with the Stars TV show. And she is championing young Belgian fashion designers by wearing their clothes in her official appearances. “I like the idea of being able to help,” she said. “I like the idea that I can put Belgian talents in the limelight because we have a lot of amazing fashion designers, shoemakers, hat makers, bag makers.”\n\nBut for all the pain of her break with Albert, and the long legal battles, Delphine jumped at the offer of reconciliation. King Philippe – who attended the Queen’s funeral in London – made the first move at the end of 2020, inviting Delphine to join him for lunch at the palace.\n\nThen, a few days later, Albert and Paola invited her to the Belvédère Castle, the royal couple’s official residence just outside Brussels. Was this awkward? “No, it wasn’t at all,” she says. “It’s as if we had never parted, which is very, very strange.”\n\nThat led to meetings with the rest of the family. Again, Delphine says it was not nearly as tricky as one might imagine. “When you are really related, something happens and it’s natural,” she says. “The whole family is trying. We don’t see each other every five minutes. I’m busy, they’re busy. Some people think that we sit around all the time and drink tea. It’s not like that. But little by little, we are getting to know one another.”"
