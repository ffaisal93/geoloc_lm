    "Regional Development in Finland and Lithuania: a Study Visit": "Helsinki, Finland\n\nStrengthening regional democracy is important for the overall multi-level good democratic governance. The Finnish regional development, also currently in the process of reform and supported by another Council of Europe - EU project, has been an inspiration for the Lithuanian authorities.\n\nThat is why, in the framework of the CoE - EU joint project \"Establishment of legal institutional and financial framework at regional county level capacity building to enhance quality of regional public administration in Lithuania”, the Centre of Expertise is organising a study visit to Finland for representatives of the Lithuanian Regional Development Councils and other relevant stakeholders.\n\nThe participants will discuss and learn from the Finnish experience how to optimise the strategic planning at the regional level. They will meet with Finnish authorities such as the Ministry of Finance, newly established Wellbeing Services Counties, representatives of the City of Helsinki, Helsinki-Uusimaa Regional Council and the Finnish Association of Local and Regional Authorities, to exchange on the good practices on regional governance in the host country. The meetings will touch upon different topics, such as:\n\nthe institutional set-up of the regions and their programming and planning process,\n\npolitically accountable regional structures and the coordination of different bodies in the Regional Council in the context of their competences,\n\nthe role of and mechanisms for inclusion of social and economic partners in the new regions,\n\nthe need/s that ignited the reform of the Finnish regional governance system,\n\nthe fiscal decentralisation system in the context of regional / municipal governance and foreseen changes thereto,\n\noperation of joint municipal offices and current challenges in their strategic planning: eco-friendly solutions, physical planning, the municipal role in promoting local economy.\n\nThe study visit will be organised in cooperation with the Lithuanian Association of Local Authorities – implementing partner in the project.",
    "Lithuania has already sent 50 M113 armored vehicles to Ukraine – minister": "VILNIUS – A total of fifty M113 armored personnel carriers donated by Lithuania have already reached Ukraine, but further military support will have to be discussed with NATO allies, Defense Minister Arvydas Anusauskas said on Monday.\n\n\"As to military assistance to Ukraine, Lithuania has supported and will continue to support it,\" Anusauskas told reporters after the State Defense Council's meeting.\n\n\"Our armored vehicles arrived in Ukraine (...) just three days ago, and now 50 M113s have already been handed over to Ukraine,\" he said.\n\nThe president-chaired State Defense Council did not discuss military support to Ukraine, the minister said, adding that the meeting focused on the situation in the region, including Russia's military mobilization and possible asylum requests from Russian citizens.\n\nAccording to Anusauskas, Lithuania will consider further possible support to Ukraine in consultation with its NATO partners, because the country has to meet its commitments to the Alliance and ensure the security of the troops it is hosting.\n\n\"Our armed forces are NATO's armed forces and our capability is also important for our allies who are here,\" the minister said. \"This is why every time we consider a reduction of our capability (...), we have to discuss with our allies how we are going to compensate for this.\"\n\n\"There are many issues that cannot be resolved very quickly,\" he added.\n\nTo make up for the lost capability, Lithuania expects an earlier arrival of Joint Light Tactical Vehicles (JLTVs) under its contract with the United States, according to Anusauskas.\n\n\"Another 50 (JLTVs) will apparently arrive in November, in addition to the 50 that came last year,\" he said. \"We'd like this to happen faster; not everything always goes according to our wishes, but there are always those conversations.\"\n\nEarlier on Monday, the 15min news website reported, citing three sources, that Kyiv has asked Vilnius to hand over to Ukraine part of its German-made PzH 2000 self-propelled howitzers, a Norwegian NASAMS air defense system and more US-made M113 armored vehicles.\n\nWhen asked to comment on the news report, Anusauskas said that Lithuania \"has not considered such things\".\n\nAccording to the minister, the PzH 2000 and NASAMS are \"systems that have a critical role for Lithuania's defense\", and the NASAMS system is the only one protecting the Siauliai air base and is \"critical in the overall NATO context\".\n\nLithuania lags well behind all neighboring countries in terms of its heavy artillery capability, he said.\n\n\"We have the only self-propelled howitzer battalion that has reached its full capacity, which is 18 units. Our neighboring countries, our northern neighbors, unfortunately, have much greater capabilities,\" Anusauskas said.\n\n\"Lithuania is lagging behind in this area, and I stress that this is not a capability that we have a lot of, somewhere in reserve,\" he added.\n\nIn addition to the M113s, Lithuania has handed over 105 mm howitzers and heavy mortars to Ukraine. Anusauskas stressed that these weapons had been part of the capabilities used by the Lithuanian Armed Forces, rather than a reserve.\n\n\"What makes us different from other countries is that we, seeing Ukraine's need, give them part of our capabilities,\" the minister said. \"We emptied the warehouses a long time ago. It is difficult to define the limit (of what we can give); it depends on the situation in Ukraine.\"\n\n\"But we are discussing all things,\" he said, reiterating, however, that sending German howitzers and NASAMS systems to Ukraine is not under consideration right now.",
    "Lithuania's InterMin proposes to terminate bilateral agreements with Belarus": "VILNIUS – Lithuanian Interior Minister Agne Bilotaite attended a meeting of the country's State Defense Council on Monday and proposed to terminate bilateral international agreements and inter-institutional agreements with Belarus in the areas under the Interior Ministry's control.\n\n\"The Belarusian regime continues to use migrants as a tool of political pressure, and Belarusian officials, through their active actions, contribute to the organization of the illegal migration crisis and destruction of the physical barrier. Since Belarus is violating the principles of international law and fails to comply with bilateral agreements, they are meaningless and we propose to terminate them\", the interior minister said in a statement released by her ministry.\n\nThe existing bilateral international agreements with Belarus are losing their meaningfulness, given continuous geopolitical threats in the region and the fact that Belarus, as an ally of Russia, continues its orchestrated hybrid aggression against Lithuania on the bilateral border, the minister said.\n\nThe Belarusian regime's hybrid pressure on the protection of the state border will continue unabated, and the risk of major border incidents is also possible, the ministry says. Therefore, the support of the Lithuanian army and other state institutions will continue to be necessary to protect the state border.\n\nSince the restoration of its independence, Lithuania has signed a number of bilateral agreements with Belarus on cooperation in the areas under the Interior Ministry's control, as well as several inter-institutional agreements, but their practical implementation has not been taking place for some time already, the ministry pointed out.\n\nEarlier, Lithuania suspended the implementation of European Commission-funded cross-border cooperation programs with Belarus and Russia.",
    "One in five people in Lithuania is at risk of poverty": "In Lithuania the at–risk–of–poverty rate last year was 20% and one in five people in Lithuania was at risk of poverty, informs public broadcaster LRT, referring to the Lithuanian Statistics Department.\n\n«Compared to 2020, the at–risk–of–poverty rate has decreased by 0.9% and by 2.9% over four years,» said Inga Masiulaitytė–Šukevič, Deputy Director of the Lithuanian Statistics Department.\n\nLast year, the poverty risk threshold was 483 euros per month for a single person and 1 015 euros for a family of two adults and two children under 14. At–risk–of–poverty rate was 17.4% in urban areas and 25.4% in rural areas.\n\nThe highest rate was recorded in the 65+ age group, at almost 36%.\n\nHowever, the highest poverty risk level was found in households consisting of a single mother or a single father with children, at least one of whom was under 25 years old. Among those employed, 7.5% were below the poverty risk threshold, compared to 50% of those unemployed.\n\nAccording to Masiulaitytė–Šukevič, the absolute poverty rate in the country was almost 4%.\n\nMoreover, 36.4% of the population lived in households that would not be able to meet the 380–euro contingency from their own resources. Around 9% of households were unable to eat meat, fish, or equivalent vegetarian food at least every other day. Also, 33.5% of households could not spend at least one week of their holidays away from home.\n\n«Children at risk of poverty were not only forced to restrict their leisure needs due to lack of funds but were also undernourished, and a large proportion had to make do with second-hand clothes,» Masiulaitytė–Šukevič said.",

    "Lithuania Deepens Relations With Taiwan Amid China Tensions": "Lithuania’s new representative office in Taiwan has begun operations although it has yet to physically open its doors due to delays, according to media reports.\n\nLithuania’s representative to Taiwan had only recently finished quarantine procedures and was still preparing the new trade office, local media reported on Tuesday. A similar report by Reuters cited a Taiwanese diplomat saying the new office was still being “fitted out.”\n\nTaiwanese media earlier reported that the new office would open on September 12, but the date came and went without an official announcement. Both Lithuania’s and Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs declined to specify a date when the office would formally open its doors following inquiries from VOA.\n\n'Like-minded partners'\n\nThe Baltic state said last year it would open the office to cement its growing ties with Taiwan even as both sides risk attracting the ire of China.\n\nLithuania, a nation of around 2.7 million, has emerged as one of Taiwan’s most unlikely yet outspoken allies in Europe as it pursues a “values-first” foreign policy. The two sides, which both transitioned to democracy in the 1990s, have been pulled closed together by shared commonalities like an authoritarian past and ongoing threats from powerful neighbors Russia and China.\n\nIn a sign of their growing ties, the 28-person visiting delegation led by Vice Minister of Economy and Innovation Karolis Žemaitis is the latest in a wave of Lithuanian delegations to visit this year alone.\n\n“Lithuania and Taiwan want to build connections because we feel as like-minded partners that share the same democracy, rule of law and human rights values,” Rasa Juknevičienė, a Lithuanian representative in the European Parliament, wrote to VOA in response to written questions. “We have a right and intention to deepen cooperation.”\n\nThe European Union is one of Taiwan’s largest trading partners, and many countries have turned to Taiwan for its advanced manufacturing capability and renowned semiconductor industry. The EU and other member states, such as Germany and France, also have trade missions or offices in Taipei, although they have been quieter in their support for Taiwan, observers say.\n\nChina regards Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy, as its province and treats any public engagement with its government in Taipei as a political rebuke. In the past it has been swift to punish Lithuania for its open support of Taiwan, most recently sanctioning Lithuania’s deputy transport minister for visiting Taipei in August. Late last year, Beijing also downgraded its relationship with Lithuania and banned imports after Taiwan opened a de facto embassy in its capital city.\n\nMarc Cheng, executive director of the European Union Centre in Taiwan, told VOA that China may not respond immediately to the new trade office as it faces domestic concerns. Beijing needs stability ahead of the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party next month, he said.\n\nZsuzsa Anna Ferenczy, a former political advisor at the European Parliament and assistant professor at Taiwan’s National Dong Hwa University, also said Beijing might be running out of options for now.\n\n“I don’t think there’s anything more China can do against Lithuania with economic coercion,” Ferenczy told VOA, although she did not rule out that China could retaliate against Taiwan.\n\nEurope alarmed\n\nChina’s treatment of Lithuania has alarmed Europe at a time when many countries are viewing Beijing with more wariness, not the least because of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s close relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nXi met with Putin shortly before the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics and some analysts believe he asked Putin to delay his invasion of Ukraine until after the games ended.\n\nPost-invasion, Chinese companies have helped prop up Russia’s economy by supplying it with much-needed goods and services in the face of Western sanctions and a mass exodus by multinational brands. China has also stepped in to help Russia evade Western sanctions by buying its oil, offering it a crucial economic lifeline.\n\nIn Lithuania, a former Soviet republic, an “anti-China” stance can be “synonymous with support for Ukraine,” said Una Aleksandra Bērziņa-Čerenkova head of the Asia program at the Latvian Institute of International Affairs, although some in Lithuania's business community are less enthralled by potential business opportunities in Taiwan.\n\nOther European countries are wary of China’s expansion into the Indian and Pacific Oceans, experts say, notably naval powers like France and the Netherlands. But EU heavyweight Germany has also expressed concern. Experts like Rafal Ulatowski at the University of Warsaw’s Faculty of Political Science and International Science said they must now balance their deep economic ties with long-term political fears, according to a recent interview with the U.K. think tank Chatham House.\n\nWary of China, interested in Taiwan\n\nA growing wariness of China and its intentions has been accompanied by a newfound interest in Taiwan in some parts of the Baltics, Central and Eastern Europe — like the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Latvia and Estonia — where Chinese investment remains limited.\n\nTaiwan, though a much smaller market than China, can still offer its trade partners access to its advanced manufacturing capability and world-renowned semiconductor industry. It is also a major buyer of European exports like wind turbines, telecom equipment, and chemicals, according to the EU website.\n\nThe shift, however subtle, has not gone unnoticed by Beijing. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has accused Lithuania of “colluding with Taiwan independence separatist forces” in the past. In response to emailed questions, China’s Embassy in Brussels directed VOA to a statement where Beijing urged Lithuania not “to be taken advantage of by Taiwan independence separatist forces” and damage bilateral relations.\n\nChina’s Ambassador to France Lu Shaye recently wrote in the Global Times, a Chinese state news outlet, that it has become “politically correct” for European countries to follow in the footsteps of the U.S. by adopting an “anti-China” foreign policy. He also said European politicians have “stepped up efforts in playing the Taiwan card to chase their own interests, attract public attention and gamble for votes.”\n\nIvana Karásková, a China research fellow and a project coordinator at the Czech Republic’s Association for International Affairs, said that concerns about China are trumped by war in Ukraine — for now.\n\n“Overall, on the EU level, after the human rights issues, sanctions, COVID-19 and last but not least, the forging of Sino-Russian alliance in February, there is not much of an aptitude to look for a positive agenda with China,” Karásková said by email, adding that even positive cooperation on climate change has been sidelined by Europe’s current energy crisis.\n\n“That said, the EU would prefer to deal with Russia and China separately and not fighting ‘two theatres’ at the same time,” she said.\n\nEditor's note: The story has been updated to include a response from China’s Embassy in Brussels.",
    "Week in Lithuania: Seimas approves zero VAT on heating for two seasons, a proposal on new minimum wage tabled": "Last week, President Nausėda missed Ukraine war theme in UN chief’s speech, Lithuanian, and Polish soldiers’ joint grave found.\n\nCourt rules on BKT expansion deal\n\nLithuania’s Constitutional Court ruled on Thursday, 22 September, that the legal provision the country’s government applied in 2019 and barred Birių Krovinių Terminalas (Bulk Cargo Terminal, BKT), co–owned by businessman Igor Udovickij and Belarusian fertiliser producer Belaruskalij, from acquiring shares in Nemuno Terminalas, a stevedoring company owned by the Udovickij family, and expanding BKT does not run counter to the country’s Constitution.\n\nBKT lodged an individual appeal with the Constitutional Court after the Supreme Administrative Court of Lithuania ruled against BKT’s request in March 2021.\n\nIn its complaint, BKT asked the Constitutional Court to rule whether the provision of the Law on the Protection of Objects of Importance to Ensuring National Security regarding an investor’s relations with foreign institutions, natural or legal persons are in line with the Article of the Constitution, stating that Lithuania’s economy shall be based on the right of private ownership, freedom of individual economic activity and initiative.\n\nOrthodox Church criticises official’s visit to Patriarch of Constantinople\n\nLithuanian Orthodox Church has criticised a recent meeting of Deputy Foreign Minister Mantas Adomėnas with the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople Bartholomew I, describing it as «acting behind the back».\n\nAdomėnas attended the meeting, which took place in Istanbul on Monday, 19 September, together with Galina Vaščenkaitė, adviser to the Lithuanian prime minister, and Ambassador of Lithuania in Ankara Ričardas Degutis.\n\nAdomėnas would neither confirm nor deny that the meeting also touched upon a possible restoration of canonical subordination to Constantinople.\n\nThe Orthodox Churches of Latvia, Estonia and Moldova are the only Orthodox Churches within the canonical jurisdiction of the Moscow Patriarchate that already have the kind of autonomy that is being sought by the Lithuanian Orthodox Church.\n\nSeimas approves zero VAT on heating for two seasons\n\nLithuanian lawmakers on Thursday, 23 September, backed government’s proposal to introduce a zero VAT rate on district heating for two more winter seasons after 111 MPs voted in favour and nine abstained. As some MPs were concerned that the rate will apply to district heating only, Prime Minister Ingrida Šimonytė pointed out that the state’s electricity and gas price compensation this year is higher than any VAT rate.\n\nThe difference between the gas price paid by consumers and the market price is about four times, she said.\n\nAccording to the Finance Ministry, the state budget would lose around 54 million euros in revenue in the 2022–2023 heating season because of the VAT relief and would further lose 57 million euros in the 2023–2024 season, provided that prices remain at the same level as in the first half of 2023.\n\nSeimas slaps temporary ban on Russian, Belarusian TV, radio broadcasts\n\nThe Lithuanian parliament, the Seimas, on Thursday, 22 September, slapped a temporary ban on Russian and Belarusian TV and radio broadcasts in Lithuania. This was done due to the state of emergency in Lithuania now being limited to zones along the country’s borders with Russia and Belarus instead of its entire territory. A respective legislative amendment was passed in a vote of 113 to zero with four abstentions.\n\nThe amendment to the Law on the Provision of Information to the Public imposes a temporary ban on rebroadcasting and online distribution of radio, TV or individual broadcasts by entities established, directly or indirectly owned, controlled or financed by Russia and Belarus. The provision will remain in effect until 16 October, 2024.\n\nLithuania to decide case–by–case on humanitarian visas for Russians\n\nLithuania said it would assess each application individually following Riga’s announcement that it will not issue humanitarian visas to Russians avoiding mobilisation. Lithuania’s Foreign Ministry said Lithuania «does not have the objective and capacity to issue humanitarian visas to all Russian citizens who apply for them». Moreover, it said, Lithuania will continue to coordinate its response with regional partners and the European Union. As the Kremlin’s war in Ukraine continues for almost eight months, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a partial mobilization in the country on Wednesday, 21 September.\n\nProposal on new minimum wage tabled\n\nLithuania’s ministers of finance and social security and labour confirmed officially that their respective ministries propose to increase the minimum monthly wage by 15%, and the non-taxable income threshold – by almost 16% from January 1, 2003. Finance Minister Gintarė Skaistė said on Wednesday, 21 September, that her mini0stry proposed to increase the maximum applicable non-taxable income threshold by 85 euros, i.e. to 625 euros, from 540 euros, which means an increase of 15.7%. According to the proposals, the minimum monthly wage would be increased by 110 euros, to 840 euros (before tax), while the non–taxable income threshold would be raised by 85 euros, to 625 euros.\n\nLithuania reports 1 707 new COVID-19 cases, no deaths\n\nLithuania recorded 1 707 new coronavirus infections and no deaths from COVID-19 over Tuesday, September 20, official statistics showed on Wednesday, September 21. Of the new cases, 1 249 were primary, 447 were secondary and 11 were tertiary. The number of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 now stands at 162, including 12 ICU cases. The daily number of new coronavirus cases remains well below the peak of over 14 000 reached in early February.\n\nSome 70%of the Lithuanian population have received at least one coronavirus vaccine jab so far.\n\nPresident misses war in Ukraine in UN chief’s speech\n\nLithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda sain Tuesday, 20 September, he missed the «Ukraine theme» in UN Secretary–General Antonio Guterres’ speech as he opened the UN General Assembly on Tuesday.\n\nIn Nausėda’s own words, the war in Ukraine is a necessary topic to discuss as by attacking Ukraine in February, Russian violated the world order that until then was based on respecting agreements, the president said.\n\nLater on Tuesday, 20 September, Nausėda delivered his speech in which he focused on Ukraine, saying that Russia’s propagated war narrative prevails in some parts of the world and needs to be changed.\n\nLithuanian, Polish soldiers’ joint grave found\n\nA joint grave of Lithuanian and Polish soldiers has been found near the village of Lazdėnai near Elektrėnai, some 30 km west of Vilnius, the local municipality said on Tuesday, 20 September.\n\nA team of archaeologists found the remains of 14 people, according to the Office of Search and Identification of the Polish Institute of National Remembrance, which is carrying out excavation in the area.\n\nThe soldiers are believed to have died during the Lithuanian–Polish military conflict of 1919–1920.

    "Telia Lietuva 5G network covered 80 percent of Lithuania’s population": "English Lithuanian\n\nTelecommunications company Telia Lietuva received the permission from the Lithuanian Communications Regulatory Authority (CRA) to provide commercial fifth-generation mobile networks services. 5G is immediately operational with 1,100 base stations in the 700 MHz band and 110 base stations in the 3.5 GHz band. Telia Lietuva 5G network reached more than half of the country's territory and 80 percent of its population.\n\nLithuania is one of the leaders in the European telecommunications market but until now the country did not have 5G diamond in its crown. However, the situation changes, as about 65 percent of Lithuania’s territory and 80 percent of the population will have Telia Lietuva 5G signal starting from today. The company activated this service immediately after receiving CRA's permission to use 700 MHz and 3.5 GHz frequencies that was acquired in two auctions for EUR 30 million for a twenty-year period.\n\n\"We were the first in Lithuania to launch all digital technologies - 2G, 3G, 4G, and now 5G. We have been preparing for this start for 4 years and have invested over EUR 100 million in the upgrade of our entire network. Although Lithuania is one of the last \"pagans\" in Europe in terms of the commercial 5G networks, we will show that we can become one of the leaders in the development of 5G roll-out. This is especially important for Lithuanian businesses, as 5G technology will provide enormous growth potential and level of competitiveness. I am convinced that more digital life is what the future’s world needs - smarter, more sustainable and I honestly believe, better,” said Dan Stomberg, CEO of Telia Lietuva.\n\nIntensive development of 5G base stations is planned throughout 2023. The focus will be on the northeastern Lithuania, where all base stations are planned to be updated with Ericsson network equipment. By mid-summer 2023, Telia Lietuva 5G connection will cover 99 percent of Lithuania's territory.\n\n5G devices and plans\n\nTelia Lietuva customers can use the 5G networks without any additional fees - all they need is a “5G payment” plan and a device that supports 5G in Lithuania. Among the 5G-enabled smartphones, the most popular are those from Apple, Samsung, Xiaomi, OnePlus and other smart devices. Detailed list of 5G supporting devices and 5G coverage map can be find at any time at Telia Lietuva website.\n\nFor the mobile device to connect to the 5G connection in the specified areas of its operation, it may be necessary to update the phone's operating system to the latest version. The device will then automatically connect to the network and the 5G icon will appear on the screen.\n\n5G badge is the same, features are different\n\n5G communication operating in Lithuania uses 3.5 GHz and 700 MHz frequencies. Devices in the 3.5 GHz frequency coverage area will be able to reach speeds of up to 2 gigabits per second (2 Gbps). Where 3.5 GHz can't reach, devices will automatically use the wide coverage 5G connection in the 700 MHz frequency band. Its speed will be like fast 4G, but it will have much more capacity and with much lower latency.\n\nTelia Lietuva first will enable the fastest 5G network running on 3.5 GHz frequencies in densely populated areas where huge amounts of data are moving, where there is no fiber optic cable yet, where high speed is required.\n\nTelia Lietuva was testing 5G technology in Lithuania since 2018 and has been providing commercial 5G services in Vilnius using 2100 MHz frequency band since January of 2022.",
    "Repeated pushbacks cause mental and physical suffering for people crossing Lithuanian border - Lithuania": "Asylum seekers and migrants, including families with young children, are being subjected to repeated pushbacks between the borders of Lithuania and Belarus with little to no access to basic needs or fair asylum procedures.\n\nMédecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is appalled by the medical and humanitarian impact of Lithuania’s hostile migration policies towards people on the move, as well as the use of inhumane practices such as pushbacks in response to people seeking safety.\n\nThere have been numerous instances of Lithuanian authorities forcibly returning migrants and refugees to Belarus, resulting in the breach of their rights. The Lithuanian State Border Guard Service (SBGS) publicly claims to have carried out thousands of pushbacks at the border since the start of the year.\n\n“It is unacceptable that the Lithuanian government is trying to normalise this mistreatment and denial of rights in response to the movement of people who have fled their countries out of desperation, in search of safety and a better life,” says Georgina Brown, MSF country manager in Lithuania.\n\n“People on the move in Lithuania are entitled to dignified and humane treatment, including safety and international protection,” she says. “And yet we know that many people trying to enter Lithuania are being denied all of this and instead find themselves stranded, isolated, and abused.”\n\nSome people have told our teams that they have been repeatedly pushed back and forth across the border over days, or even weeks.\n\n“For 30 days, we didn’t settle in one place. We went back and forth around 10 times between Belarus and Lithuania during that time,” says Cassandra*, a mother who was pushed back and forth by authorities between both countries over 30 days.\n\n“The guards kept moving us in and out, in and out, and back and forth,” she says. “Once we were captured, we were given some tinned food which was expired and dry. I couldn’t even eat that, as I kept it for my children.”\n\n“Then they would put us back in cars and take us back to the border,” continues Cassandra. “It was a cat and mouse situation. I was traumatised and I just wished to go anywhere there was shelter so it would put an end to our suffering.”\n\nSuch repeat pushbacks compound the distress and trauma faced by migrants and asylum seekers at the borders of the European Union.\n\n“People who already faced several traumas such as sexual violence and torture in their country of origin are now faced with the new trauma of violent pushbacks,” says Heidi Berg, MSF psychologist in Lithuania.\n\n“They feel as though they are being hunted and chased across the border again and again,” she says. “This leaves them feeling dehumanised and with an even higher level of stress and anxiety.”\n\nFear of being detected and pushed back is also leading people on the move in Lithuania to try and cross isolated areas with no access to basic needs and medical aid.\n\nMSF teams in Lithuania have treated people for skin and lower limb conditions developed after walking long distances through forests and swamps, as well as exhausted families and individuals who have slept exposed to the elements, often without adequate clothing and footwear.\n\nOur teams are aware of people who have contracted gastrointestinal illnesses after being forced to eat berries and plants and drink swamp water out of hunger, thirst and desperation.\n\nCassandra* tells of her family’s experience being pushed back and forth by authorities between Belarus and Lithuania for over 30 days...\n\n“The Belarusian border guards forced us to enter Lithuania. We told them ‘we don’t want to go any more’, but they came with full gear and weapons, intimidating us. Their faces were covered. They put us in cars and drove us for two to three hours near to the border with Lithuania.\n\nOnce in Lithuania, we were in areas where there are CCTV cameras. We waved to the cameras as we knew the guards could see us on the screens and they turned up in less than three minutes.\n\nThey took photos of us with our passports and then confiscated them along with our mobile phones. They put us in a car and took us back to the border crossing. Then they opened the door (the official border crossing) and let us walk back to Belarus.\n\nWe managed to return to Minsk. In the second attempt, we took a route to Poland, but we were caught by the border guards and beaten up in a very violent manner. My 19-year-old son was physically attacked. Even my husband, who is in his fifties, was kicked and punched.\n\nOne time we were pushed back to Belarus. We were so shattered, it was raining heavily, we couldn’t attempt to move any further. We had no more energy, so we stayed in that spot. We lit a fire and slept there until the next morning. My husband was desperately calling out for help from everywhere to reach us, as we were in a dire condition.\n\nOur family were all together first. In our last attempt to cross, we had to split our family. Me and three of my children and our adopted adult son found a taxi and asked the driver to report us to the border guards, because my daughter needed medical help. My husband and two of my other children, a 10-year-old girl and a 12-year-old boy, remained in the forest, where they were stranded for a week until they managed to get back to Belarus.\n\nThe next day two people from an NGO spoke with us and then we were sent to a camp in Lithuania. We were initially put in an area that looked like a prison with high fences and barbed wire. Then we were moved to a bigger place with more space to walk, but we still can’t go out of the camp.\n\nIt has been a very traumatic situation. We didn’t expect any of this to happen to us – we wanted protection. But we’ve been subjected to a horrible journey and now my family is split. Half of my family is in Belarus – my husband, my 10-year-old daughter and 12-year-old boy. My other children are here with me.\n\nI am devastated and I cannot bear being split from my children. We Facetime every day. My daughter cries, we both cry, and we desperately want to be reunited.”\n\nAs winter approaches, we are alarmed about even more serious consequences for the physical and mental health of people subjected to such mistreatment.\n\nLithuania’s hostile migration policies are yet another example of an EU member state deliberately creating unsafe conditions for people to seek asylum at its borders.\n\nPeople will continue to make desperate journeys to where they believe they can seek international protection, safety and a better future, regardless of the risks or lack of welcome they may face, and despite the lack of safe and legal routes.\n\nThe Lithuanian government must not continue with such abusive responses to vulnerable people seeking safety at its borders.\n\n“People have fled conflict, persecution, and danger with little more than the clothes on their back in search of international protection,” says Brown.\n\n“As winter approaches and temperatures fall, Lithuanian authorities must urgently cease these cruel practices and respond to the needs of those trying to enter the country with humanity,” she says.\n\n*Name changed to protect identity",
    "New CEB grant to Lithuania to support children with disabilities fleeing Ukraine - Lithuania": "PARIS – The Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB) and the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour of Lithuania have signed a grant worth almost €419,000 from CEB’s Migrant and Refugee Fund (MRF) to improve living and educational conditions for children with disabilities fleeing the war in Ukraine. This brings the total amount of MRF grants approved in response to the Ukraine crisis to approximately €6.4 million.\n\nThe grant will finance the renovation and equipping of the Social Care Centre Vija in the city of Kaunas, including the construction of an outdoor children’s playground, purchase of a bus and the operational costs through the end of 2023.\n\n“This project is very important for us because it aims to support the most vulnerable population fleeing the war in Ukraine – children with disabilities,” said CEB Governor Carlo Monticelli. “We are pleased to continue cooperating with the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour of Lithuania to help Ukrainian refugees as well as their hosting communities.”\n\nAround 37 per cent of all refugees from Ukraine are children. As of September 2022, Lithuania welcomed 1,094 unaccompanied minors, mostly from orphanages in Ukraine.\n\nYet, Lithuania is not fully equipped to receive unaccompanied minors with disabilities of very young age. Although the authorities have started capacity building as part of the European Union’s Resettlement and Relocation Scheme for Asylum Seekers, the country’s social care institutions lack the services and infrastructure suitable for receiving infants and preschool children.\n\n“The Council of Europe Development Bank is allocating funds to Lithuania for the second time. Thanks to these funds, we will be able to take better care of Ukrainians fleeing the war, especially children,” said Monika Navickięnė, Lithuania’s Minister of Social Affairs and Labour. “Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, we have received several groups of unaccompanied minors, including children with disabilities. I hope that the funds allocated to Lithuania will increase our country’s opportunities to implement a more sustainable policy of reception and asylum.”\n\nThe minister emphasized that given the drastic change in the situation of migration flows in Lithuania and the country’s geopolitical situation, it is necessary to invest in the development of new accommodation places, adapt existing facilities and improve the quality of reception conditions for refugees.\n\nOut of 88 social care institutions for children in Lithuania, only five provide social care services for children with disabilities and accommodate about 80 children. The Vija Social Care Centre is already hosting 35 Ukrainian children with disabilities in partially adapted premises. The children are aged between nine months and four years, and they came from an orphanage in the Kharkiv region.\n\nIt is expected that with the help of CEB’s grant additional 30 to 40 places at the Vija Social Centre could be created.\n\nThe signed grant is the second one from the MRF that the CEB has approved to the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour of Lithuania to help support refugees from Ukraine. In May 2022, the Bank approved almost €500,000 for the renovation and extension of accommodation facilities of the Refugee Reception Center in the Kaunas region. The implementation of this grant is expected to be completed by the end of 2022, creating 120 accommodation places for refugees.\n\n* * *\n\nMore on CEB’s response to Ukraine refugee crisis: CEB and Ukraine refugees | CEB (coebank.org)\n\nAbout the Migrant and Refugee Fund: Migrant and Refugee Fund (MRF) | CEB (coebank.org)",
    "Lithuania topples last Soviet monuments": "Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, the revolutionary Bolshevik and founder of the Soviet Union, died in 1924 but remained omnipresent decades after his death. Carved in stone and cast in iron, he stood larger than life in the most prominent places of cities all over Lithuania.\n\nBut with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, his cult of personality was over. As elsewhere in formerly communist countries, Lenin sculptures and those of other dictators were taken down from their pedestals and removed from sight.\n\n\"After the rapid demolition of many monuments in the early 1990s and the renaming of streets and squares, the issue of monuments then fell into obscurity for a long time,\" said Arunas Bubnys, the director of the Genocide and Resistance Research Center in Vilnius.\n\nBut with the start of the Russian war in Ukraine on February 24, resentment against the former Soviet Union and current Russian policies has once again increased. People in Lithuania are afraid of being attacked by Putin's troops.\n\nIn the small town of Merkine, the statue of a Soviet soldier was removed from its pedestal in May\n\nMemories of the occupation of Lithuania, which began in 1940 — a product of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union — are newly present. Ultimately, the occupation ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union. But until 1953, mass deportations took place, particularly to Siberia.\n\nThe ambivalent history of the country also includes the fact that many antisemitic Lithuanians participated in the murder of around 200,000 Jews during the German occupation from 1941 to 1944. The Genocide and Resistance Research Center, led by the historian and archivist Bubnys, covers Lithuanian antisemitism, but also focuses on resistance to the Soviet regime.\n\nLithuanian paramilitary groups prepare\n\nThis scientific center includes the Museum of Occupations and Freedom Fights, where Soviet secret services tortured and murdered prisoners in the building in the middle of Vilnius. The Nazis also used the building for the same purpose during their temporary occupation during World War II.\n\nThe exhibitions focus on Lithuania's oppression, which lasted nearly 50 years, when the country, like all Baltic states, was a Soviet republic. During this time, hundreds of thousands of Lithuanians ended up in prisons and labor camps for political reasons, or were killed outright.\n\nSculptures removed from cemeteries\n\nWhen Lithuania won its independence in 1991, it quickly rid itself of most of its prominent Soviet propaganda heritage: statues of Lenin and monuments with tanks and soldiers. In some places, however, Soviet monuments remained. But thanks to the ongoing war in Ukraine, there are now plans to remove remaining symbols like the red star, and the hammer and sickle, said Bubnys. Sculptures in cemeteries are also being removed.\n\nThis memorial to Soviet soldiers at the Antakalnis cemetery in Vilnius is scheduled to be removed in September\n\nBut Violeta Davoliute, a professor at the Institute of International Relations and Political Science at Vilnius University, thinks this could be problematic. She wants to see an unemotional debate on how to deal with symbols from the past. \"Is it just a wreath or are there other symbols? If they don't symbolize Soviet military power, then they should be left standing,\" she said.\n\nIn the small town of Merkine, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) southwest of Vilnius, the decision was different — there, those in charge decided to remove a 2-meter high statue of a Russian solider from its pedestal back in May. Davoliute would have preferred to leave it in place. Such statues would be good for documentation purposes, she argues. \"You could use the statue to try to explain and present complicated history.\"\n\nGvidas Rutkauskas is also against removing all Soviet traces in Lithuania — yet he could have every reason to want their removal. He was born in Siberia, where his parents had been deported. Nevertheless, the chairman of the Lithuanian Union of Political Prisoners and Deportees is against disposing of all communist relics.\n\nGvidas Rutkauskas doesn't agree with removing everything from the past — 'after all, it's part of our history'\n\nAccepting history\n\nRutkauskas believes it isn't necessary to remove everything from the past — \"after all, it's part of our history,\" he told DW. Future generations should know what came before them. But he left no doubt as to when a line would be crossed for him. \"If there is a Soviet tank or symbols with the Soviet star on an important square in a city, then they should be removed,\" he said.\n\nHowever, due to the threat posed to Lithuania by the war in Ukraine, the argument for removal has solidified — most are in favor of removing all evidence of communism. Liucija Verveckiene of The (Post)Soviet Memory Studies Center, TSPMI, however, noticed the shift in opinion before the war. According to her, 2014 was a turning point.\n\nAt that time, Russia annexed Crimea, and since then, pro-Russian separatists and regular Ukrainian troops have been fighting in eastern Ukraine. This changed the debate about removing Soviet relics from public space, she said.\n\nThe Russian annexation of the Crimean peninsula changed Lithuanians' attitudes, said Liucija Verveckiene\n\nAnother question is how to deal with personalities from arts and culture who were said to be close to the Soviet leadership. As an example, the historian mentions Lithuanian writer Petras Cvirka, who died in 1947, and who, as a communist, supported Soviet policies. The monument erected in his honor in Vilnius was removed in November 2021.\n\nThe novellas, short stories and children's books by the controversial author have been translated into English, Chinese and many Eastern European languages. Verveckiene considers his case to be exemplary when it comes to the difficult question of what is meant by collaboration with the former Soviet regime. Cvirka did not harm anyone personally, but he did support the Soviet system.\n\nReunion with Marx and Stalin in Grutas Park\n\nIf one day all traces of communism disappear from Lithuania's streets, squares and cemeteries, those interested in the communist past could still visit Grutas Park in the country's south. Since the turn of the millennium, unwanted sculptures have been collected on the park's extensive grounds — works depicting Lenin, the dictator and mass murderer Josef Stalin, the head of the secret service Feliks Dzierzynski, German philosopher Karl Marx, and many others.\n\nThis statue of Josef Stalin stands alongside other discarded monuments in Grutas Park, southern Lithuania\n\nCurrently, 87 monuments stand among fir, pine and birch trees. Barbed wire entanglements and watchtowers can also be seen, as they were common in Siberian penal camps. For the older visitors to the park, there are photo boards with information about the origin of the sculptures and when they were removed. For the younger guests, there is a children's playground. In neighboring meadows, goats graze and ostriches strut.\n\nCritics consider the privately run open-air museum to be a mix of Disneyland and a house of horrors. Historian Davoliute from Vilnius University, on the other hand, is more positive. On her first visit to Grutas Park, she and her colleagues viewed the sculptures in a \"humorous light.\"\n\nThe researcher said this kind of presentation can seem to be trivialize, especially to foreign visitors. For the people of Lithuania, on the other hand, the Soviet monuments gathered in Grutas Park made it easier to look at their past. \"You can also laugh about it,\" she explained.\n\nThis article was originally written in German.\n\nWhile you're here: DW editors round up what is happening in Germany and the world in regular e-mail newsletters.

    "Lithuania: Discriminatory detention practices compound people’s trauma - Lithuania": "The mental health of vulnerable migrants and asylum seekers is sharply deteriorating due to prolonged detention in Lithuania, the international medical humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said today. The flawed migration practices and legal processes of the Lithuanian authorities discriminate against people of certain nationalities, who are being held in continued detention. MSF denounces prolonged detention and systemic discrimination in Lithuania, and is calling for the immediate implementation of humane alternatives that equitably meet the needs of vulnerable and traumatized people.\n\n“Many of the people detained have survived deeply traumatic experiences,” said Georgina Brown, MSF country manager in Lithuania. “But, instead of responding to their needs, the Lithuanian authorities are worsening their mental suffering by detaining them and holding them in limbo. These men, women, and children are uncertain of their future, terrified of being forcibly returned to the danger they have fled, and imprisoned without freedom, autonomy, or adequate protection. People’s resilience will diminish, and their suffering will only grow exponentially. Appallingly, we know that some nationalities are more likely to have this detention extended than others, creating a hierarchy of suffering that the Lithuanian authorities should be deeply ashamed of.”\n\nApproximately 700 people are detained in Kybartai, Pabrade, Rukla, and Naujininkai Foreigner Registration Centers (FRCs) in Lithuania, after having crossed the border from Belarus in 2021. Many of them have severe vulnerabilities and have experienced highly traumatizing events. Detention only compounds people’s suffering.\n\nMSF has seen that certain nationalities are significantly more likely to have their detention extended, remain detained after their detention order has expired, or have the limited freedom of movement they may have been granted revoked. For example, out of 184 people being held in Kybartai FRC during August 2022, Nigerians make up 16 percent of the total population, but 28 percent of the 65 people who had their detention extended. Six percent of detainees are Indian, but 15 percent of the 65 who have had their detention extension are Indian. Additionally, Russian and Belarusian asylum seekers who recently arrived in the FRC were not subject to detention at all, and have all been granted limited freedom of movement.\n\nSince January 2022, MSF has provided mental health care to people detained in Lithuania. Our teams also provided primary health care until May 2022. However, mental health support cannot address the root cause of people’s suffering. Between January and March 2022, more than 70 percent of patients highlighted detention as the main cause of their need for support.\n\n“I am so desperate, I tried to hurt myself because I want to [get] out from this prison,” a man detained in an FRC in Lithuania told MSF. “Many times, I really decided to be ready to kill myself. You are hurting, you are embarrassed, you are abused. And so, this is prison. I was desperate. I was so depressed. But I can’t because we need more courage. I am not too broken.”\n\nMSF sees this distress echoed in other FRCs across Lithuania, including some where data is almost impossible to gather. We are receiving numerous reports from some of the FRCs that some nationalities, including Nigerians and Congolese, are more likely than others to be subject to discriminatory migration practices. These include continued detention after the expiration of their detention order without a court-issued extension, and having their limited freedom of movement revoked, returning them to detention.\n\nAround the world, MSF has seen how hostile migration policies and practices—such as arbitrary and prolonged detention—deny people their rights to seek safety and compound their distress. MSF is calling for the practice of prolonged and extended detention to end immediately, and for the implementation of an equitable asylum system that respects the dignity, health, and human rights of all people seeking safety in Lithuania.",

In addition, the measures aim to ensure that Russian citizens do not pose a threat to Lithuania’s public order, national security, international relations, or public health, as stated in the Schengen Border Code.\n\nExplaining the country’s decision, the Minister of Internal Affairs Agnė Bilotaitė said that they are forced to take these measures as they cannot risk the safety of the residents. Additionally, she said that a large number of Russians continue to support the war in Ukraine and emphasised that it is important to protect national security.\n\n“It is likely that among the Russian citizens who support the war in Ukraine, there are individuals who can intentionally harm the security of our country, so our message is very clear – while taking care of the safety of our people, we will use all available measures to strengthen security, one of them – during the state of emergency, we will apply stricter border controls to Russian citizens verification procedures,” the statement of Bilotaitė reads.\n\nThe Ministry further pointed out that the resolution of the government confirms that only some special categories of Russian citizens are permitted entry to the country.\n\nCurrently, Lithuania permits entry only to persons performing international transport, Russian diplomats transiting through the country, persons holding a residence permit issued by an EU state, Russians holding a long-term national visa, as well as those whose purpose of entry is for special humanitarian reasons.\n\nPreviously, SchengenVisaInfo.com reported that Lithuania, as well as Estonia, Latvia, and Poland, will stop issuing visas for Russians and ban them from entering from September 19.\n\nSuch a decision was announced by the foreign ministers of all the above-mentioned countries through a joint statement.\n\n“Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland have agreed on a common regional approach and hereby express their political will and firm intention to introduce temporary national measures for Russian citizens holding EU visas,” a part of the statement reads.\n\nEditor’s Pick:",
    "The inside guide to Kaunas, Lithuania's Capital of Culture for 2022": "As joint European Capital of Culture in 2022, Lithuania’s second city is finally getting the plaudits it deserves. Like the capital, Vilnius, it has a relaxed Old Town, a ruined riverside castle, and buzzing bars and restaurants, but Kaunas’s unique appeal lies in its concentration of interwar architecture in its New Town. Much of it was built between 1919 and 1939, when the city briefly served as Lithuania’s capital, and there are hopes its modernist district will be approved for UNESCO World Heritage status next year.\n\nBefore you take in the architecture, however, head to the farmers’ market, which sets up beside the castle every Saturday. Many of its stalls sell just one speciality, be it gherkins, dark rye bread, woodland honey, skilandis (smoked pork sausage) or sakotis, the sweet, traditional ‘tree cake’ cooked on a spit. Nearby, on Jonavos gatve street, the two-storey Wise Old Man mural, which appeared in 2013, was one of the first efforts to revitalise tired public spaces with street art. New murals are constantly being added to the city — you can pick up the Wallographer’s Notes map from the tourist office to create a personalised walking tour.\n\nTethering the Old Town to the New Town, Laisvės Alėja (Freedom Avenue) is a mile-long boulevard flanked by linden trees, terrace bars and art deco buildings. Make a beeline for Spurginė, a stuck-in-time 1960s doughnut bar with a countertop loaded with pillowy fried spurgine doughnuts. Go for one of the savoury options, stuffed with minced pork, or indulge in a sweet variety filled with apple jam or chocolate.\n\nFreedom Avenue is also home to Lithuania’s best craft brewery, Genys. Try a beer flight on the terrace, in the shadow of the neo-Byzantine dome of St Michael The Archangel Church, built in the 1890s when Kaunas was part of the Tsarist Russian empire.

    "Lithuania to Officially Extend State of Emergency at Its Borders With Belarus & Russia": "The Lithuania authorities have announced that the country has officially decided to extend the state of emergency along the entire border section with Belarus and the Kaliningrad region of Russia.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAnnouncing the news, the Ministry of Interior of Lithuania said that the proposal had been approved by the government, and the state emergency will be extended until December 16, 2022, SchengenVisaInfo.com reports.\n\nUnder the current draft, the state of emergency would remain in place until September 16. However, taking into account the current situation, the Lithuanian government decided to prolong it until the end of the year.\n\nEarlier this week, when the Lithuanian Ministry of Interior proposed that the country extends the state of emergency along its border with Belarus and the Kaliningrad region, the Minister of Internal Affairs, Agnė Bilotaitė, said that such a measure is necessary to ensure the security of Lithuanian society.\n\n“The insecure and unstable geopolitical situation creates conditions for the Russian and Belarusian authorities to carry out hybrid attacks and various kinds of provocations against Lithuania. In response to this, we must apply the necessary security measures to counter potential threats,” Bilotaitė stated.\n\nIn addition, the Minister pointed out that such a measure is needed in order to stop any other form of hybrid attacks from Belarus and Russia against Lithuania. According to the Minister, migrants have been used as a form of hybrid attack against Lithuania and emphasised that the country will not permit entry to around 6,000 of them this year.\n\n“Almost 6,000 migrants will not be allowed into Lithuania this year. Belarusian officials damage the physical barrier installed on the Lithuanian border with Belarus, organize the transport of illegal migrants to the state border and direct them to the territory of Lithuania,” the statement of the Ministry reads.\n\nApart from the above-mentioned, it was noted that the state borders would continue to be protected under an enhanced regime.\n\nMoreover, the Ministry said that a stricter regime would continue to apply for nationals of Russia and Belarus applying for visas. Lithuania already restricted the issuance of visas for nationals of these two countries earlier this year. However, certain exemptions apply in cases where the Ministry of Foreign Affairs mediates.\n\nOther EU countries are also expected to soon introduce stricter rules against citizens of Russia.

    "Lithuania: Poles fight for Polish-language classes": "The Polish community in Old Trakai near Vilnius, Lithuania, continues to be threatened by the reorganisation and destruction of Polish educational establishments. As reported by TVP Wilno, the local government of the Trakai region has decided to transform the only Polish-language group in the kindergarten in Old Trakai from 2 to 4 years old into a mixed Polish-Lithuanian group.\n\nThe Polish group in the kindergarten can be fully formed, as there are currently 13 children in it, 7 currently attending the kindergarten and 6 from new applications. Meanwhile, the local government is proposing to move these 6 new children to the Andrzej Stelmachowski Primary School in Stare Trakai, where there is neither space nor conditions for the admission of 6 children from the age of 2.\n\n\n\n“The situation is, frankly, uncomfortable and even frightening. We face problems every day, fighting for our rights as a national minority,” said Maria Puch, a councillor in the Trakai District Self-Government.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Polish schools also struggling\n\nsource: TVP WIlno, Kurier Wileński\n\nThe management and parent committees of schools in Lithuania are not giving up the fight for Polish education in the country.The Polish community declares to continue the fight also for two Polish schools in the Trakai region threatened with liquidation: Longin Komołowski Secondary School in Polukun and Andrzej Stelmachowski Primary School in Stare Trakai, which the Trakai district authorities intend to demote to the role of branches of other educational establishments.Regarding the school in Polukun, a court halted two decisions of the local government - that of April 8, concerning the reorganisation plan (it court pointed out irregularities in the planning process for this reorganisation), and that of April 28, concerning the reorganisation, i.e. the downgrading of these schools to the level of branches.Earlier, the authorities said that without a sufficient number of pupils, the school would be in danger of losing its legal status and becoming a branch of the Henryk Sienkiewicz Middle School in Lentvaris.Moreover, due to further legal implications concerning the organisation of classes with regard to the number of pupils, the authorities decided to postpone consideration of the matter until the next meeting, which is scheduled to take place on September 29.",
    "Lithuania completes 502 kilometre border barrier with Belarus - Baltic News Network - News from Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia": "Linas Jegelevičius for BNN\n\nThe construction of a fence consisting of raze wire and stretching approximately 502 kilometres along Lithuania’s border with Belarus has been completed, EPSO–G, Lithuania’s state–owned energy group responsible for the project, has announced.\n\nAlthough the Lithuanian authorities praised the landmark accomplishment, which is believed to significantly enhance security of the border, it comes amid a new surge of undocumented migrants at it.\n\nVSAT, Lithuania’s Border Protection Service, told BNN that, lately, the numbers of migrants have edged upward starkly. Over Wednesday, 31 August, border guards deterred 123 migrants attempting to cross into the country from Belarus illegally, VSAT said on Thursday, 1 September.\n\nThe largest number of migrants so far was recorded last Saturday, 27 August, when border guards turned away 125 persons.\n\nLithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Šimonytė praised the project’s completion and admitted it was «technically impossible» to erect physical barriers along the entire frontier, which crosses lakes, rivers and swamps.\n\nLithuania’s harsh migrant policy has led to accusations that it is carrying out illegal pushbacks.\n\nThe PM acknowledged it is a «challenge» (for Lithuania) to follow international law on irregular migrants, saying her country has «lots of work to do».\n\nLaurynas Kasčiūnas, a Conservative MP and head of the influential parliamentary committee on national security and defence, said this on the announcement: «Indeed, we clearly see a new wave (of undocumented migrants), one with the participation of Russia. The majority of the people have arrived here through Russia…In fact, some of them are trying to cross the border multiple times, but they fail. The benefit of the barrier is undeniable,» he insisted though.\n\nIn total, more than 13 600 of them have not been admitted from Belarus to Lithuania since 3 August of last year, when VSAT was entitled to turn illegal migrants away, it said. Last year, almost 4 200 people arrived illegally from Belarus to Lithuania.\n\nHowever, far from all are happy with the barrier. Some say it can trigger a direct gunfire–involving exchange between Lithuanian and Belarusian border patrols, others point out that the barrier can be tampered, while environmentalists caution that the hindrance can trap, hurt and kill animals and birds.\n\nRemigijus Žemaitaitis, an opposition parliamentarian, says no border barrier is impenetrable unless it is like the China Wall.\n\n«You can fly over it, you can dig underneath. Look, North Korea has built a massive border wall, yet still we hear that some just overcome it…If we see the efficiency of the Lithuanian barrier at just, say, around 30% it will be a very good result…Unfortunately, the ruling party [Conservatives, officially the Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats, HU–LCD] use the emergency to cover its inefficiency and deficiencies,» he told BNN.\n\nAs reported by BNN, there have been at least several hints by PM Šimonytė of necessity to shake up the Cabinet, but the premier has never followed up on the intent, citing the contingencies – the migrant influx and war in Ukraine.\n\nBesides, the opposition MP notes that the border barrier will likely turn into a silent killer of birds and animals.\n\n«I think it is just a matter of time when all the environmental NGOs will start clamouring, but for many birds and animals it will be just too late,» the lawmaker noted.\n\nHe says that the ruling Conservatives first chastised Hungary fiercely for building its own wall and now has built its own.\n\nAn attempt to tamper the barrier on the border has already drawn attention of the country’s President’s office.\n\nKestutis Budrys, the Lithuanian president’s senior adviser on national security affairs, has slammed tampering of the fence by Belarus’ officers as provocations.\n\n«One thing is to lead migrants to the border and push them, but tampering with the physical barrier, which we see now, is a different thing,» he told the Žinių Radijas news radio on Tuesday, 30 August.\n\nBudrys stressed that Lithuania found itself in «a very dangerous zone» due to such circumstances as Belarus’ officers were being sent to another country to tamper with physical assets and protective facilities.\n\n«We find ourselves on a very thin verge and dangerous verge, how we will qualify such actions… These are provocations, at the very minimum,» he pointed out.\n\nAs a reminder, about two years ago, Vilnius decided to build the physical barrier in a bid to stave off irregular migration from the neighbouring country.\n\nYet Vilnius has received much criticism over its treatment of irregular migrants on the border and those admitted in the migrant detention facilities.\n\nThe international non–governmental organisation Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has condemned this week Lithuania’s practices with regard to irregular migrants, saying they are subjected to «systemic discrimination» at foreigner registration centres.\n\nAccording to the organisation, vulnerable migrants are held in prolonged detention in Lithuania and experience an alarming deterioration in their mental health.\n\nAccording to MSF, Lithuania’s asylum practices and legal processes are flawed as they are further discriminating against certain nationalities.\n\nAs reported, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled earlier this year that Lithuania’s legislation that does not allow migrants to apply for asylum and gets them detained simply for entering the country irregularly runs counter to European directives.\n\nResponding to recent criticism from Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) over Lithuania’s treatment of irregular migrants, Interior Minister Agnė Bilotaitė says they are now allowed to leave their accommodation facilities and have access to basic services such as healthcare.",

Fewer trains are reportedly being considered this winter as a way to save energy, meaning those that do run will be very busy",

    "Lithuania: An inside look into how it has become a global GovTech leader (Sponsored)": "For several years now, Lithuania has been making huge progress in the GovTech sector – using technology to enhance government and public service. Thanks to successful collaboration between the government and startups, Lithuania has a pool of innovative pilot solutions currently underway.\n\nSo, why has this small country taken the leadership role in the digital public sector space so seriously?\n\nIt might be a recent phenomenon that Lithuania has propelled itself forward in leading the GovTech space, but the drive for cooperation between government and startups has been part of Lithuania’s DNA for a very long time. Let’s wind the clock back to the 14th century. Back then, Duke Gediminas of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania wrote letters to global medieval “entrepreneurs”, inviting them to relocate to Lithuania and to develop their business here. Of course, at that time the solutions were nowhere near digital, but it’s a historical fun fact that perfectly reflects how Lithuania was (and still is!) ready to welcome everyone who wants to do their business here.\n\nFast forward several hundred years later. Lithuania made another call for a global innovation community, but this time – in a digital sphere.\n\nLithuania 2000\n\nThirty years ago, Lithuania announced a vision: Lithuania 2000. Years before the trends of co-creation picked up in other countries, Lithuania 2000 invited the world’s largest tech companies to join forces in developing Lithuania’s digital state. This became the foundation for public sector services and its IT infrastructure.\n\nLeading the GovTech movement\n\nToday, Lithuania is renowned to have a strong digital foundation. Lithuania’s proactive approach to accelerate, not just regulate innovation, has led to the emergence of different sandboxes for mobility, energy, financial and other types of solutions. However, the pace of technological innovation and the needs of citizens are rapidly changing.\n\nTo address this, in 2019 Lithuania took a strategic step to become one of the leaders in the global GovTech movement. The country’s desire for experimentation, an openness to unexpected ideas and unusual partnerships, and, a proactive approach to emerging opportunities all led to the creation of GovTech Lab.\n\nThe team working in the public sector is focused on encouraging collaboration between entrepreneurs and the government.\n\nLast year, Lithuania’s commitment to experimentation at scale resulted in over 50 public sector experiments that successfully piloted startup solutions. With the help of the national GovTech programme, GovTech Lab accelerated next-level co-creation between innovators and the public sector. Startups and innovative companies received monetary prizes and contracts of up to €53k to develop each GovTech pilot. This incentive encouraged startups and innovative companies to take on social, environmental, and other problems that societies usually face.\n\nThe advantage of this practice is that startups then can reach out to governments all around the world and try to apply their solutions globally!\n\n“We believe in collaboration between innovators and the government because it often leads to unexpected results. Usually, one side has more expertise in the content part, the problems that society faces field, the other one – in IT, innovation field. Connecting these two sides helps to broaden everyone’s perspective, create more evidence-based solutions that respond better to the needs of citizens,” said Arune Matelyte, the Manager of GovTech Lab. “We also continuously consult other countries in the creation of GovTech labs, so that more opportunities would open up not only for governments to solve their problems in an innovative way, but also for startups as well – so they could find clients easier and scale their solutions globally.”\n\nTo be a part of Lithuania’s GovTech movement and don’t miss out on the latest GovTech news, follow GovTech Lab Lithuania’s newsletter.\n\nGovTech Lab Lithuania is a project funded by the European Regional Development Fund.

Granholm and the Minister of Energy of Lithuania Dainius Kreivys signed a historic agreement on enhanced cooperation to help achieve Lithuania’s goals of energy security and the transition to a climate-neutral energy sector. The result of a long-standing cooperation between the two countries in energy policy, this first such Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) aims to better prepare Lithuania’s energy sector to meet climate change-related threats.\n\n“The U.S. Department of Energy truly values a strong and consistent partnership with Lithuania, and this MoU further solidifies our collaboration with European allies at this critically important moment in history,” said Secretary Granholm. “We are excited for Lithuania to take advantage of our National Lab expertise to chart their own course towards clean energy and energy independence. This work, like our Net Zero World initiative with a number of other countries, will provide a roadmap to growing thousands of clean energy jobs and strengthening our economies.”\n\n“This agreement, signed together with the Secretary Granholm, is not the beginning of energy cooperation between Lithuania and the United States, but the outcome consistent and intensive cooperation lasting for a several years. It represents a shared commitment by both countries to continue to work closely together to achieve the same energy policy goals, one of the most important of which is the historic and inevitable transformation of our energy sectors. Lithuania has ambitious goals for the next three decades to become not only a fully energy-independent and self-sufficient country generating energy for its own needs from renewable sources, but also a net exporting country in the region. Over the next few decades, the energy sector will become an even more complex organism that will require special protection and resilience to external factors. Therefore, we have agreed to work together to strengthen the resilience of the energy sector to cyber threats and climate change factors,” said Minister Kreivys.\n\nThe MoU provides for specific areas of cooperation related to strengthening Lithuania’s energy sector in cyber security, as well as Lithuania’s goal of transitioning to a 100% renewable energy sector by 2050.\n\nLithuania’s Ministry of Energy and other organizations will work with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory to develop a plan to modernize the country’s electricity system infrastructure modelled after the Los Angeles 100% Renewable Energy Study (LA100). Lithuania will be the first country in the world to implement this model in order to achieve a transition of the Lithuanian energy sector to 100% renewable energy by 2050.

    "Lithuania sees uptick in bankruptcies, but will it turn into a tide? - Baltic News Network - News from Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia": "Linas Jegelevičius for BNN\n\nAs autumn sets in, so does gloom in Lithuanians’ mood – many are bracing for difficult months ahead. Perhaps unprecedentedly nerve-racking and purse–pinched.\n\n«Our sewing company is winding down its activities. The German businessman, who owns it, explained us bluntly the deterioration of Lithuania’s relations with China over Taiwan and now the war in Ukraine are just too much for the company to bear. We relied heavily on exports of Chinese threads and the war in Lithuania’s relative proximity scares the owner,» Edita, a garment designer in the Vilnius-based company, told BNN.\n\nClothing manufacturers’ revenues are still on decline – as much as 12% from the start of the COVID pandemic in 2020, according to the analysis of the Creditinfo Lietuva credit bureau.\n\nFabric manufacturing companies are faring a bit better, but both sectors continue to shrink in terms of employment. Although the number of clothing manufacturing companies in Lithuania increased slightly from 1 285 (2019) to 1 341 (2021), the number of employees in this sector decreased by 12 percent during this period – from 1 4803 in early 2020 to 13 068 in late 2021.\n\nDue to the impact of the pandemic, the income of this sector also fell by almost 12% – from 396 million euros in 2019 to 350 million euros in 2021.\n\n«The garment sewing business has lost steam. Lithuanian workforce has become too expensive and then you have the pandemic and the war spillovers,» Edita underscored to BNN.\n\nOnce Edita is out of job by turn of the year, she has no idea what she will do next. Her husband works for a state institution, but his salary is less than one thousand euros.\n\n«The prices are exorbitant. Just for the preparation of our two sons for the new school year, we spent over 300 euros. If the state does not extend its hand, we may end up in trouble,» the Vilnius resident confessed.\n\nWith electricity and gas prices rising to new record highs, the country’s all industries are facing huge challenges. Trying to shun losses, some companies, like «Solteras» in Panevėžys in the northeast of Lithuania, are already stopping perlite production and consider moving to Poland as a solution.\n\n«Solteras» director Dainius Spirikavičius says that a critical limit has been reached.\n\n«Costs are such that our production loses competitiveness. Gas and electricity have increased in price about ten times. We used to pay up to 20 000 euros per month for gas and electricity, now the bills are about 200 000. We have no other way but to stop the activity,» he told Lithuanian media.\n\nMany trouble-stricken companies, like «Solteras», handle the emergencies on their own. But some other industry sectors ring alarm bells – if the government does not come at the rescue now, it can be too late soon.\n\nGytis Kauzonas, director of the Lithuanian Poultry Association (LPA), has warned this week that this winter will be critical, as the sheer majority of the poultry industry companies will default on energy bills. He says it is impossible to stop the production because of the millions of live birds in the country’s farms.\n\nLPA requests state support: 0.09 euro cents per kilogram of a broiler and 0.9 euro cents per egg. Another request it has for the liberal-conservative government is to simplify the requirements for state support – after the pandemic years, the financial results many poultry farms see are very poor, he claims.\n\n«This support is needed because egg farmers are being pressured to switch to free-range hens and the entire sector would need over 60 million euros for this. For broilers, it would be about three million euros per year. In addition, subsidies are needed today to offset energy costs. The business is unable to pay all the bills alone and is in a trap,» the LPA head underlined.\n\nHe says the poultry sector in Lithuania is disappearing and without state support, the sector may not survive next year, as the price of gas went up ten times, electricity – three times.\n\nBusiness representatives warn that if the government does not take measures to curb the prices of energy resources, mass layoffs and corporate bankruptcies will begin.\n\nIn fact, they have already begun – in the last six months, 1.7 times more Lithuanian companies operating in Lithuania started bankruptcy procedures than in the same period last year, say the latest bankruptcy statistics published by the Lithuanian Department of Statistics.\n\nAccording to its data, in the first half–year of 2022, 312 companies initiated bankruptcy in the second quarter. Of them, 274 started the procedures in the second quarter.\n\nYet the largest number of companies for which bankruptcy proceedings were initiated operated in the construction sector: in the first half of this year, bankruptcy proceedings were initiated for 137 construction companies, and in 2021 in the same period – 57.\n\nThe number of initiated bankruptcies has almost doubled in the economic entities providing wholesale and retail trade, motor vehicle, and motorcycle repair services: 135 companies announced initiated bankruptcy during this half–year, compared to 64 in the same period last year.\n\nSimilar and statistics of establishments providing accommodation and catering services. This year, in the first half of the year, the bankruptcy procedure was initiated for 61 companies, last year – for 33 companies during the same period.\n\nThe situation is also difficult in the field of processing production: 53 companies working in this field announced and initiated bankruptcy in the first half of the year, compared to 35 during the same period last year.\n\nAccording to the data of the Lithuanian Statistics Department, the largest number of bankruptcies initiated in the past six months are in the counties of three large cities: 271 in Vilnius county, 121 in Kaunas, and 83 in Klaipėda.\n\nEconomists and organizations protecting business interests are talking loudly that if struggling businesses do not receive state aid, the number of bankrupt companies will only increase, but the general economic situation is not yet as dramatic as it was before the 2008 crisis.\n\nMeanwhile, Swedbank economist Nerijus Mačiulis claims that the increase in the number of bankruptcies should not be surprising. There are at least several reasons for this. In particular, after the end of the pandemic and the end of state support, some companies were unable or unwilling to recover. However, it is more likely that this year some companies were tripped up by the greatly increased energy costs. As the average price of electricity has increased by almost ten times, companies that are highly dependent on it and have not signed long-term fixed price contracts have found themselves in an unenviable situation.\n\nAnother reason, especially concerning the second quarter of this year, bankruptcies could already be initiated by companies whose activities were too dependent on trade relations with Russia, he says.\n\nHowever, according to the economist, with the exception of isolated problematic cases, the overall situation is not dramatic: in the second quarter of this year, more than 50,000 jobs were created. new jobs, the number of unemployed is the lowest in the last 15 years, and the average salary increased by almost 15% this year.\n\n«It is likely that we will see an increase in the number of bankruptcies in the coming years due to declining global demand, the continuing European energy crisis, and problems in Eastern markets. The unemployment rate may increase by one percentage point in the next few years, a slight contraction of the economy lasting several quarters is also likely, but the probability of a deep crisis remains low,» says N. Mačiulis.",

    "Lithuania raises army alert level after Russia's military call-up": "By EUobserver\n\nLithuania on Wednesday increased alert levels of its army \"to prevent any provocations from Russia,\" the country's defence minister Arvydas Anusauskas wrote on Facebook, after Moscow announced on the same day a partial military mobilisation for the war in Ukraine. \"As Russia's military mobilisation will also be carried out in the Kaliningrad region, our neighbourhood, Lithuania cannot merely watch,\" he said, asking that support for Ukraine be increased.",
    "Lithuania's former president Grybauskaite a favourite in the upcoming presidential elections - Baltic News Network - News from Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia": "Linas Jegelevičius for BNN\n\nA new poll gauging Lithuanians’ affinity with potential candidates for the 2024 presidential election raised some eyebrows. Gitanas Nausėda, the incumbent president, is outstripped by Dalia Grybauskaite, the country former head–of–state.\n\nAnd neither the ruling party, the Homeland Union–ithuanian Christian Democrats (TS–LKD) nor the largest opposition party, the Farmers and Greens Union see their potential candidate in the new survey by Spinter Tyrimai, the pollster.\n\nIt shows that 17.2% of the country’s voters would opt for Grybauskaitė, and 15.6% would give their votes to Nausėda.\n\n«The results must be a bitter pill to Nausėda. One sees he is up to his eyeballs in dealing with the situation in Ukraine, the major economic challenges stemming from record-high inflation, yet he lags. It is clear that, for swaths of voters, he is not their candidate. He clearly falls out of favour with the majority of TS–LKD supporters,» Vytautas Dumbliauskas, associate professor of Mykolas Romeris University in Vilnius, told BNN.\n\nGrybauskaitė served as the eighth President of Lithuania from 2009 until 2019.\n\nBefore that, Grybauskaitė served as Minister of Finance, as well as European Commissioner for Financial Programming and the Budget from 2004 to 2009.\n\nIn foreign press, she was often referred to as the «Iron Lady» or the «Steel Magnolia».\n\nIn the survey, incumbent Prime Minister Ingrida Šimonytė came in third with 8.4%, followed by Ignas Vėgėlė, ex–chairman of the Lithuanian Bar Association, who grabbed headlines during the COVID pandemic for his resistance to lengthy quarantine in the country, with 6 percent, and ex-Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis racked up 5.6%.\n\nNotably, Šimonytė already participated in the presidential election in 2019 – Nausėda received 66 percent of all votes and Šimonytė – 33%.\n\n«I really doubt if she wades in the same river again. Albeit the government has received a boost from the war (in Ukraine), her popularity is unimpressive, to put it mildly. And the economic problems the country is faced with will be just worsening her electoral hopes, if there are any,» the analyst said.\n\nFurther down the line in the poll was a journalist and public figure Andrius Tapinas with 3.7%, Vilija Blinkevičiūtė, leader of the opposition Social Democratic Party, with 3.4%, and Defence Minister Arvydas Anušauskas with 3.2%.\n\nTapinas garnered much attention for spearheading a campaign to buy a Bayraktar TB2 military drone for Ukraine, which was successfully completed.\n\nThere are rumours in Lithuania that the Conservatives, who are struggling to find a proper candidate for the election, might talk Tapinas into becoming their presidential hopeful.\n\n«Not having their own candidate (in the presidential election) would be very damaging to the party. Its chairman, Gabrielius Landsbergis, who is the grandson of Vytautas Landsbergis, the patriarch of independent Lithuania, is hugely unpopular with voters. Obviously, he knows it well,» Dumbliauskas emphasised.\n\nAccording to him, Blinkevičiūtė, leader of the social democrats, feels «cozy» in Brussels, where she is an euro parliamentarian, and, perhaps, does not fancy idea of squaring off with the others.\n\nOther proposed candidates received less than three percent of votes in the survey.\n\nAs President Gitanas Nausėda rolled recently over the presidency’s three–year benchmark, many Lithuanian analysts say jokingly that his second term is «inevitable».\n\n«I’d give him [Nausėda] a strong mark on the 10–mark scale, perhaps 8.»\n\nThe president’s popularity speaks for him. His accomplishments certainly outweigh those minor setbacks he has seen so far,» Andžej Pukšto, associate professor of Kaunas Vytautas Magnus University, has told BNN.\n\nAnd the international geopolitical turbulences – and especially the war – are carrying him strongly. «When it comes to the front of foreign policy, especially dealing with the other heads-of-state as far as the war is concerned, the president was «extremely capable and leading the effort», the analyst said.\n\nSpeaking of just this week alone, Nausėda has not left the front-page headlines for most of it. On Monday, 19 September, he attended the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II, the longest-serving monarch in British history. But on Tuesday, 20 September, he was already in New York, addressing the 77th session of the General Assembly of the United Nations (UNGA).\n\nIn his speech Nauseda said that Russia’s actions in Ukraine have led to the danger of a nuclear disaster in Europe. He also called on international community to distinguish between the aggressor and the victim of aggression.\n\n«These past few months have also revealed the danger of a looming nuclear disaster in Europe. The deployment of Russian military personnel and weaponry at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant is alarming and totally unacceptable… A nuclear power plant should never be used as a military base!» the Lithuanian leader stressed.\n\nLithuanian analysts note that the war has helped Nausėda to iron out disagreements with the ruling party, TS–LKD.\n\nBut will the president keep insisting on reshuffling the government amid the war? And looking forward, will Nausėda walk to victory in 2024 hands–down?\n\n«From today’s perspective he is a clear front–runner. As of now, I do not see any suitable candidates able to contest him. But they may crop up later. Not sure if they can provide a stronger punch however,» Pukšto says.\n\nMeanwhile, Dumbliauskas admits that Nausėda is «very good» on the war, but, domestically, he struggles to find «his electorate», he says. «He has been criticising the government harshly, so he cannot rely on the HU-LCD voters. He is lacking support in the parliament, Seimas,» analyst said.\n\nYet with no serious contenders around, the president can feel safe and comfortably. For now.",
    "PACE rejects all Lithuanian candidates for European Court of Human Rights": "The three candidates selected by the Lithuanian Justice Ministry were Professor Lyra Jakuleviciene of Mykolas Romeris University, Judge Aiste Rackauskaite-Burneikiene of Vilnius City District Court and Judge Gediminas Sagatys of the Lithuanian Supreme Court.\n\n\"We have been informed of a rejection of the list at this stage,\" Justice Minister Ewelina Dobrowolska said.\n\nShe said there were doubts about one candidate, but did not disclose why all three nominations for the post of ECHR judge had been rejected, noting that this information was not public.\n\nAccording to information available to LNK, the candidates were rejected due to an inadequate national selection procedure.\n\nHowever, it is said unofficially that PACE might have found the educational background of the minister, who heads the task group selecting the final candidates, to be a problem.\n\nAccording to Dobrowolska, the selection process, where the three candidates had to be chosen from only six applicants, lacked competition and publicity.\n\nThe minister says the selection procedure will be changed and a new call for applications will be launched next month.\n\nThe term of office of Egidijus Kuris, Lithuania's current ECHR judge, is set to end on October 31.",
    "Evan Fournier and France prevailed over Lithuania": "2022-09-03T19:40:57+00:00\n\n2022-09-03T19:40:57+00:00\n\n2022-09-03T21:21:09+00:00.\n\nFrance managed to close the game the right way and beat Lithuania in the “Group of Death”\n\nBy Eurohoops team/ info@eurohoops.net\n\nIn one more big game in the “Group of Death”, France bounced back from losing to Germany by beating Lithuania 77-73.

They gave me confidence. Finally started playing basketball in this EuroBasket.”\n\n﻿\n\nThomas Heurtel scored four of his five points on this stretch plus one steal, while Terry Tarpey who had in total eight points, was crucial in defense and also made a key steal. Lithuania didn’t give up and thanks to Rokas Jokubaitis made it a two-point game (74-72) with 14 seconds left.\n\nFournier was fouled and he made one of two free throws (75-72). Ignas Brazdeikis got the rebound from the second missed shot and was also fouled. However, Brazdeikis made the first shot and missed the second on purpose, Rudy Gobert got the rebound, was fouled and the game was over with their center making both free throws.\n\n“It was a very good game, with an incredible crowd, the Lithuanians are amazing and they made the game special”, admitted French coach Vincent Collet since the game was sold out with a lot of Lithuanian fans giving their own memorable performance in the stands.\n\n“We made just nine turnovers and that was huge plus we got 11 steals and this was the main key”, he added. “We didn’t start the tournament well, but our reaction was memorable”.\n\n“It was a tough loss, back to back after losing to Slovenia”, said Brazdeikis. “We still have to keep our heads up, nothing changed on the mission, we are here to win and we can turn this around”.\n\n“We have to still fight for the title”, added coach Kazys Maksvytis.\n\nJonas Valanciunas with 15 points and eight rebounds was Lithuania’s top scorer, Jokubaitis added 14 points and Marius Grigonis had 13, but left the game injured in the closing minutes.\n\n﻿\n\nPhoto Credit: FIBA.BASKETBALL"
