    "Chile: Improve productivity, social protection and boost revenues for a sustainable recovery, says OECD": "23/09/2022 - Chile has achieved an impressive recovery from the COVID-19 crisis, but the pandemic has hampered past progress in reducing poverty and social disparities.\n\n\n\n\n\nChile needs structural reforms to boost productivity, social protection and tax revenues, while tackling short-term challenges such as high inflation, according to a new OECD report.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latest OECD Economic Survey of Chile welcomes progress on significant reforms including a universal basic pension and plans for a fairer tax system which can generate higher revenues. Measures to drive higher productivity, improve competitiveness, get more Chileans into quality jobs and to improve social protection coverage should also be a priority, the Survey says.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Chile is taking important steps towards strengthening its tax base and is closing gaps in social protection,” OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann said, presenting the Survey in Santiago alongside Minister of Finance Mario Marcel. “Complementary reforms to raise productivity and investment would help to generate stronger growth, more jobs and deliver additional income to enable Chile to invest further in economic and social progress.”\n\n\n\n\n\nChile’s solid institutions and prudent management of public finances enabled a strong fiscal response to the pandemic and a vigorous recovery. The Chilean economy grew by 11.9% in 2021, far outpacing OECD and regional peers. The Survey projects growth slowing to 1.9% in 2022 as global growth slows and inflation, now at a 30-year high, curtails purchasing power. Thanks to a swift monetary policy response, inflation should return to target in early 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nChile’s tax revenues at just 21% of GDP are very low by international standards, with close to a third of the workforce in informal jobs with only a fifth of Chileans paying personal income tax. The Survey welcomes a planned reform which would bring the tax intake closer to the Latin American and OECD averages of 28% and 34% respectively. Greater tax revenues would help strengthen the resilience of public finances and importantly help finance rising social needs.\n\n\n\n\n\nChile’s longer-term growth outlook will depend on its ability to address structural growth bottlenecks including weak competition and low investment in research and development to promote innovation.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter many years of convergence, Chile’s income and productivity gap to advanced economies is again widening. The Survey recommends simplifying cumbersome regulations and licensing procedures which hold back new firm entry and investment, increasing investment in new technologies and expanding access to high-quality education.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is also scope to diversify Chile’s exports, still dominated by the mining industry, and to improve trade facilitation and the efficiency of border procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\nChile has one of Latin America’s most comprehensive social protection systems, but the pandemic highlighted gaps in coverage, particularly for informal workers. Enhancing social protection coverage for all, including via pensions, access to health services and basic income support, can help to reduce these gaps. The Survey recommends raising pension levels while applying progressive contribution rates and unifying social assistance programmes to achieve a wider coverage. Future social benefit reforms should also pay particular attention to how they affect the incentives for creating formal jobs.\n\n\n\n\n\nChile is making significant progress on sustainable energy, with renewable sources now accounting for 47% of electricity generation as solar and wind energy have gained importance. Looking ahead, Chile has a much higher potential in renewable energy generation, far exceeding domestic needs.\n\nSee an overview of the Survey with key findings, charts and summaries in English and Spanish (this link can be included in media articles)\n\nFor further information, journalists are invited to contact Catherine Bremer in the OECD Media Office (+33 1 45 24 80 97).\n\nWorking with over 100 countries, the OECD is a global policy forum that promotes policies to preserve individual liberty and improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.",

    "Chile’s Rejection of the New Constitution Is a Sign of Democratic Maturity": "When Chile experienced mass protests in late 2019, many feared the country could be pulled into the vortex of polarization and political instability that Latin American countries often experience after large-scale upheaval. After millions of angry Brazilians took to the street in 2013, for example, the country entered a period of extreme polarization that contributed to the emergence of an antiestablishment president with authoritarian tendencies. In the same way, the traumatic instability in the aftermath of the 2019 elections in Bolivia deepened polarization further. Neither Brazil nor Bolivia have been able to address the root causes that led to public discontent and could very well experience similar bouts of public protests in the future.\n\nChile, on the other hand, has sought an alternative tonic to discontent, embarking on a risky but courageous path to rewrite the constitution in an effort to better address the many challenges the country faces, ranging from profound inequality, a lack of social mobility, and insufficient public services. After a remarkably broad and inclusive debate about the best path forward, voters approved, in October 2020, the creation of a constituent assembly, which included reserved seats for Indigenous candidates and, in a global first, gender parity. In what perhaps proved to be the most controversial element, the largest bloc of the 155 members of the constituent assembly were independents, most of whom had very limited political experience.\n\nOliver Stuenkel Oliver Stuenkel is an associate professor at the School of International Relations at Fundação Getulio Vargas (FGV) in São Paulo, Brazil. He is also a nonresident scholar affiliated with the Democracy, Conflict, and Governance Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. More > @OliverStuenkel\n\nIn retrospect, the strong presence of politically inexperienced independents and the large number of leftists in the special assembly—a reflection of the strong rejection of the center-right government under Sebastián Piñera—was crucial to explain why the constituent assembly presented, after months of deliberations, a constitution that was largely described as unwieldy and “utopian” and that could put at risk the country’s many achievements, particularly in the economic realm, over the past decades. It included numerous rights—such as to “neurodiversity” and “digital disconnection”—that were seen as bizarre by many Chileans. Ignoring the fact that most Chilean voters identify as centrists, members of the constituent assembly turned out to be overconfident that citizens would approve their draft: indeed, over the past centuries, the vast majority of constitutional plebiscites approved the texts put up for the vote. Most voters likely approved of the constitution’s progressive character, but its vagueness, sheer length—with 388 articles and 57 transitional clauses—and the legal insecurity it would have produced explain why it was soundly rejected in the constitutional plebiscite on September 4. Those who dislike the old constitution from Augusto Pinochet’s era but also had concerns about the new version were encouraged to vote “no” after leftist President Gabriel Boric signaled that he’d be open to discuss an alternative version if the draft presented by the constituent assembly were rejected.\n\nWhile critics may be right to point out that Chile wasted three precious years during which investors naturally adopt a more cautious approach, uncertain about what kind of constitution the country would eventually adopt, the public debates since the wave of protests in 2019 also produced tangible gains and led to broad consensus in areas such as Indigenous rights and women’s rights. At the same time, perhaps most encouragingly, the result—a rebuke for Boric’s support for the “approve” campaign—did not produce animosity or polarization. The president, who had publicly supported the document prior to the plebiscite, recognized the need for “a constitution that unites the country.”\n\nBoric and members of Chile’s Senate and National Congress now face two significant challenges: First, they need to articulate a process to come up with a new constitutional draft that is seen as legitimate by the population. Second, they must move quickly to avoid a situation where citizens and international investors lose patience, negatively affecting the country’s growth prospects at a time when the economic uncertainty in China has put pressure on the global price of copper, of which Chile is the world’s largest producer.\n\nThe chances are relatively high that a new draft will be a better one than the current one. It is unlikely that Chile’s president and legislators will repeat the mistakes made during the first constitutional process. “It will be a ‘woke’ text, but not a state-centric text,” predicts Patrício Navia, a Chilean professor of political science. Provided that he is right, Chile stands a chance to build a constitutional framework that attends popular demands for greater rights without affecting the country’s stellar reputation among international investors.\n\nSignificant risks, of course, remain. Despite Chile’s democratic maturity, political polarization deepened since the wave of protests that shook the country in 2019. During the weeks prior to the plebiscite, fake news flooded social media in the country, including false information that the new constitution would allow abortions up to the ninth month of pregnancy and would abolish private property. Similar tactics may affect public opinion about the next drafting process, too. According to Marta Lagos of Latinobarómetro, a polling organization, August 2022 was “the dirtiest and most violent month of electoral campaigning that Chile has had since 1989.”\n\nFor an agreement to materialize, the extremes will have to be willing to negotiate. Numerous politicians on the right campaigned against a new constitution, arguing that the old one was just fine. Far-left leaders, most of whom supported the utopian draft rejected by voters on September 4, will have to accept settling for more moderate change. Boric, whose coalition includes both centrists and members of the Communist Party, will have to ensure that the topic does not lead to government infighting. If he succeeds, Chile’s reaction to the mass protests in late 2019 remains, despite the failed first attempt, a potential model for the region, where numerous countries remain stuck in a seemingly endless cycle of rage and regret.",

    "Chile baloney": "What a lot of baloney Will Lilley writes in saying Allende ‘brought it upon himself’ when he was overthrown in a military coup by the brutal General Pinochet, backed by Henry Kissinger and the CIA in Chile, 1973.\n\nAllende was the first socialist president to be elected democratically through the ballot box in South America. That is, he and his colleagues played the game of the ruling class, the colonial powers of the US, France, the UK, and Australia. And won the election fair and square. Thisy represented the expressed ardent desire of the majority of the Chilean people to distribute the wealth of their country much more fairly amongst the people. That did not sit well with the wealthy elite and American corporations used to ripping off Chile. So they backed Pinochet and the CIA’s coup against Allende. The ‘communistas’ had to be destroyed, rooted out like they were vermin, for fear Allende’s example, like the Sandinista revolution and ‘Poder Popular’ (People Power) in Nicaragua a decade later, would spread to other impoverished nations of South and Central America, and other poor nations of the world.\n\nI was in Chile making a film in 1985 and I had firsthand experience of the murderous nature of Pinochet’s secret police who detained and tortured; they even used Alsatian dogs trained to rape women political prisoners. After the coup in ’73, Pinochet and his feared secret police rounded up ‘leftists’ like me (and many others in our Byron community) and tortured and ‘disappeared’ them. These were artists, writers, journalists, Montessori school teachers, architects, actors, and musicians who dared to want a better world for themselves and their kids. The murdered ‘leftists’ children, like the Stolen Generation here, were adopted out to childless Chilean army officers and the wealthy elite, never told who their real parents were.\n\nWill Lilley, in the ‘democracy’ (!) we live with here in Australia, you are free to peddle your sympathies for murderous fascists like Pinochet, Kissinger, Soeharto in Murdoch’s rags – he’ll believe you. He’s part of the mega-rich and ruling elite of the world. But please, don’t defile The Echo’s pages with your re-writing of history and denigrating the struggle and sacrifice of their lives by the Chilean people – a process they are still actively engaged in today with re-writing Pinochet’s Constitution.\n\nDavid Bradbury, Wilsons Creek\n\n♦ Read Damian Kassabgi’s response here.",
    "‘My Imaginary Country’ Review: Chile in Revolt": "The most powerful images in “My Imaginary Country” are of the demonstrations in the streets of Santiago, Chile, that began in October 2019. Hundreds of thousands of Chileans took to the streets, at first to protest a subway fare increase, and eventually to demand sweeping changes to the nation’s economic and political order. They were met with tear gas, baton charges and plastic bullets aimed at their eyes. Some fought back with cobblestones chiseled from the street, which they hurled at the police.\n\nTo watch scenes like that in a documentary film — or, for that matter, on social media — is to experience a strong sense of déjà vu. What happened in Santiago in 2019 and 2020 feels like an echo of similar uprisings around the world; in Tehran in 2009 (and again this week); in Arab capitals like Tunis, Damascus and Cairo in 2011; in Kyiv in 2014; in Paris at the height of the Yellow Vest movement in 2018. Those episodes aren’t identical, but each represents the eruption of long-simmering dissatisfaction with a status quo that seems stubbornly indifferent to the grievances of the people.\n\nAccompanying the exhilaration that these pictures might bring is a sense of foreboding. In almost every case, these rebellions ended in defeat, disappointment, stalemate or worse. The buoyant democratic promise of Tahrir Square in Cairo has been smothered by a decade of military dictatorship. Ukrainian democracy, seemingly victorious after the Maidan “revolution of dignity,” has since faced internal and external threats, most recently from Vladimir Putin’s army.",
    "In Chile's desert lie vast reserves of lithium — key for electric car batteries": "ATACAMA DESERT, Chile — In the middle of the desert in northern Chile, massive pools of Caribbean blue water sit next to what appear to be snowdrifts.\n\nBut this is a lithium mine.\n\nThe pools are filled with salty groundwater that contains lithium. It's a key component in the rechargeable lithium-ion batteries for electric cars, solar panels and other green technologies.\n\n\"It's really, really a beautiful place,\" says Marcelo Valdebenito, a public relations officer for Albemarle Corp., the Charlotte, N.C.-based chemical company that operates the mine. \"This is the lithium that powers the world.\"\n\nIndeed, the world is hungry for the silvery-white metal. The International Energy Agency is projecting a more than 40-fold increase in demand for lithium by 2040. Lithium prices have hit record highs this year.\n\nDespite growing concerns about the environmental impact of lithium extraction, skyrocketing demand is good news for mining companies in Chile. The South American country is the second-largest lithium producer after Australia. And Argentina, Bolivia and Chile are known as the \"lithium triangle,\" together holding more than half of the world's proven lithium reserves.\n\nAnnual production at the Albemarle mine has increased from 22,000 tons to 84,000 tons since 2016, says Ignacio Mehech, the company's country manager in Chile.\n\n\"We are growing as the demand is growing and today we are a much bigger company,\" Mehech told NPR, adding that the company now has 1,000 employees in Chile, up from 250 five years ago.\n\nSouth America could power up\n\nEven so, the region's lithium output is just a fraction of what it could be, leading to fears of an eventual bottleneck in world supplies.\n\nBolivian President Luis Arce has pledged to make his country \"the world capital of lithium\" and supply 40% of global demand for the metal by 2030. But due to technological challenges and community resistance, as well as heavy state intervention in the economy, the industry has been slow to develop. Production in Bolivia remains negligible.\n\nEconomic turmoil has kept Argentina from opening more mines.\n\nMeanwhile, Chile has high taxes and strict mining regulations, says Mehech. The red tape for production permits involves securing approval from the nation's nuclear energy commission since the metal can be used in nuclear power and weapons.\n\n\"It is very difficult and that's why you don't see more lithium companies in Chile,\" Mehech says of Albemarle, which he says is one of just two companies producing lithium in Chile.\n\nMining raises environmental concerns\n\nBut some Chileans prefer a go-slow approach.\n\nThey include microbiologist Cristina Dorador, who has spent years studying the salt flats of the Atacama Desert. She says lithium mines extract huge amounts of groundwater. Ten-times saltier than seawater, this brine is then placed in enormous evaporation pools. After 18 months, the resulting 6% lithium solution is then turned into a white lithium powder and exported for use in batteries.\n\nDorador says removing so much groundwater will inevitably make the Atacama Desert — home to Chile's lithium mines — hotter and drier. She recently co-authored an investigation linking lithium mining to an 11% reduction in the local flamingo population over the past decade.\n\n\"With so much pressure from the world to produce more lithium,\" she says, \"the price is going to be paid by Chile's environment.\"\n\nWhy not make the batteries, too?\n\nAnother critic is Andrés Díaz, who directs the Center for Energy and Sustainable Development at Diego Portales University in Santiago, the Chilean capital. Instead of just lithium, he thinks Chile should produce and export higher-valued lithium-ion batteries that the country currently imports from Asia at a steep cost.\n\nTo move in that direction, Albemarle signed an agreement with the Chilean government to spend $300 million on research and development here by 2043.\n\n\"For us, it doesn't make any sense to export lithium and then buy from other countries batteries with a material that we produced at the very beginning,\" Díaz says.\n\nMehech acknowledges that lithium mining uses a lot of groundwater but claims the tradeoff is worth it. He points out that the amount of water required to produce enough lithium for an electric car battery is about the same amount needed to produce a half pound of beef or 11 avocados.\n\nThe avocados, he says, will last for just a few days, \"but a lithium battery lasts for 10 years and then you can recycle it.\"\n\nCopyright 2022 NPR.

    "Chile: Referendum presents unique opportunity to recognise the right to housing in new Constitution": "GENEVA (2 September 2022) – Chile’s referendum for a new constitution on Sunday will provide an opportunity to recognise the right to adequate housing in its domestic legal order, a UN expert said today.\n\n“The referendum gives Chile a unique opportunity to join the increasing number of countries that have given legal recognition to the right to adequate housing in their constitutions,” said Balakrishnan Rajagopal, UN Special Rapporteur on the right to adequate housing.\n\nOn Sunday 4 September, the people of Chile will vote in a historic referendum on a new constitution that will replace the current document which was drawn up during Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship.\n\nThe Special Rapporteur has consistently advocated that States give full legal recognition of the right to adequate housing – a fundamental right enshrined in UN human rights treaties Chile has ratified.\n\n“In 2018 my predecessor recommended that Chile include an explicit reference to the right to adequate housing in its Constitution and make the right justiciable along with other economic, social and cultural rights. Similarly, the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has urged Chile to guarantee the comprehensive recognition and necessary legal protection of economic, social and cultural rights in the new text of the Constitution,” Rajagopal recalled.\n\n“Most recently the UN Guidelines on the Implementation of the Right to Adequate Housing have called on all States to recognise the right to adequate housing as an enforceable right through applicable constitutional and legal provisions,” the expert said.",
    "‘It’s a miracle’: Gran Abuelo in Chile could be world’s oldest living tree": "In a secluded valley in southern Chile, a lone alerce tree stands above the canopy of an ancient forest.\n\nGreen shoots sprout from the crevices in its thick, dark trunks, huddled like the pipes of a great cathedral organ, and water streams down its lichen-streaked bark on to the forest floor from bulbous knots in the wood.\n\n“It was like a waterfall of green, a great presence before me,” remembers the climate scientist Jonathan Barichivich, 41, of the first time he encountered the Gran Abuelo, or “great-grandfather”, tree as a child.\n\nBarichivich grew up in Alerce Costero national park, 500 miles (800km) south of the capital, Santiago. It is home to hundreds of alerces, Fitzroya cupressoides, slow-growing conifers native to the cold, wet valleys of the southern Andes.\n\n“I never thought about how old the Gran Abuelo could be,” he said. “Records don’t really interest me.” However, Barichivich’s groundbreaking study has shown the 100ft (30-metre) giant could be the world’s oldest living tree.\n\nIn January 2020, he visited the Gran Abuelo with his mentor and friend, the dendrochronologist Antonio Lara, to take a core sample from the trunk.\n\nThey were able to reach only 40% into the tree as its centre is likely to be rotten, making a complete core unattainable. Yet that sample yielded a finding of about 2,400 years.\n\nUndeterred, Barichivich set about devising a model that could estimate the Gran Abuelo’s age. Taking the known ages of other alerces in the forest and factoring in climate and natural variation, he calibrated a model that simulated a range of possible ages, producing an astounding estimate of 5,484 years old.\n\nThat would make it more than six centuries senior to Methuselah, a bristlecone pine in eastern California recognised as the world’s oldest non-clonal tree – a plant that does not share a common root system. Some clonal trees live longer, such as Sweden’s Old Tjikko, a Norway spruce thought to be 9,558 years old.\n\nBarichivich takes a core sample from a tree stump. Photograph: Salomón Henríquez\n\nBarichivich believes there is an 80% chance the tree has lived for more than 5,000 years – but some colleagues have poured scorn on the findings. They assert that complete, countable tree ring cores are the only true way of determining age.\n\nThe climate scientist hopes to publish his research early next year. He will continue to refine his model but waves away the “colonialism” present in the field.\n\nThe Gran Abuelo isn’t just old, it’s a time capsule with a message about the future Jonathan Barichivich\n\n“Some colleagues are sceptical and cannot understand why we have revealed the finding before formally publishing it,” he said. “But this is post-normal science. We have very little time to act – we cannot wait one or two years, it could already be too late.”\n\nBarichivich believes ancient trees may help experts understand how forests interact with the climate.\n\n“The Gran Abuelo isn’t just old, it’s a time capsule with a message about the future,” he said. “We have a 5,000-year record of life in this tree alone, and we can see the response of an ancient being to the changes we have made to the planet.”\n\nIn January, Barichivich, who works at the Laboratory for Climate and Environment Sciences and Environment in Paris, won a €1.5m European Research Council starting grant he describes as the “holy grail” for a scientist.\n\n\n\nHe has embarked on a five-year project to assess the future capacity of forests to capture carbon, hoping to add tree-ring data from thousands of sites around the world into climate simulations for the first time.\n\n\n\nMore than a third of the planet’s vegetated surface is covered by forests, capturing carbon dioxide during photosynthesis, but current models are only able to make estimates for 20 or 30 years into the future.\n\n\n\nBy adding data for xylogenesis, the formation of wood, Barichivich believes he could provide 100-year predictions for climate change – and revolutionise our ability to understand and mitigate its effects.\n\n“If tree rings are a book, then for 40 years everyone’s just been looking at the cover,” he said.\n\n‘Bit by bit, the tree is dying’\n\nBarichivich poses with Gran Abuelo. The climate scientist has embarked on a five-year project to assess the future capacity of forests to capture carbon. Photograph: Salomón Henríquez/the Guardian\n\nIn an office surrounded by varnished samples, fragile cores and wood shavings, Barichivich’s mentor Antonio Lara, 66, has spent his career working to reconstruct temperature, precipitation and watershed levels throughout history.\n\n\n\nLara, a professor at the Faculty of Forest Sciences and Natural Resources at Chile’s Austral University in the southern city of Valdivia, has been able to prove that alerces can absorb carbon from the atmosphere and trap it for between 1,500 and 2,000 years in standing dead trees. Buried alerce trunks can hold carbon for more than 4,000 years.\n\nHe has also pinpointed exact climatic events by translating tree rings into numbers, which can then be read like a barcode. “The great-grandfather tree is a miracle for three reasons – that it grew, that it survived, and then that it was found by Jonathan’s grandfather,” Lara said.\n\n\n\nIn the mid-1940s, Barichivich’s grandfather, Aníbal Henríquez, arrived from the southern city of Lautaro to work for the forestry companies felling the lahuan, as the alerces are known in the Indigenous language Mapudungun, his native tongue.\n\nHe went on to become the park’s first warden, but many giant alerce trees had already fallen victim to loggers before Chile made it illegal to cut them down in 1976.\n\nAlerce shingle was used as currency by local populations throughout the 1700s and 1800s and the wood was commonly used in construction. The famous Unesco-protected wooden churches on the island of Chiloé are built from alerce trunks.\n\n\n\nHenríquez happened upon Gran Abuelo while out on a patrol in the early 1970s. Although he was reluctant to disclose the find at first, word soon got out and people began to arrive: now, more than 10,000 tourists trek down to the small wooden viewing platform next to the tree each summer.\n\nAlerce shingle was used as currency by local populations throughout the 1700s and 1800s.

After 29 other trees were vandalised by tourists, Chile’s national forestry corporation, which manages the country’s national parks, closed the trail indefinitely.\n\n\n\nBarichivich hopes that by showing that Gran Abuelo is the world’s oldest tree, he could raise the alarm about the urgency with which we must protect the natural world. While the scope of his research is far broader, Barichivich insists the national park in which he grew up is where he belongs.\n\n\n\nWhen he was eight years old, his grandfather disappeared on a routine patrol out in the snow. His body was found two days later. Another uncle, also a park ranger, later died in the park.\n\n\n\n“It seems like it’s a family tradition,” Barichivich said. “The same fate probably awaits me, dying with my boots on out in the forest. But first I want to unlock its secrets.”",
    "Proposed new rules regarding foreign tax credits in Chile": "Chile has a unilateral and a bilateral foreign tax mechanism.\n\nThe unilateral tax credit mechanism is applicable for countries that have not signed a double tax treaty with Chile. It applies only to certain kinds of foreign-sourced income and is limited to a maximum rate of 35%.\n\nThe bilateral tax credit mechanism applies to foreign-sourced income earned from a country with which Chile has a double tax treaty. It applies to all kinds of income included in the treaty and is also limited to a maximum rate of 35%.\n\nSince the corporate income tax rate is 27%, if the foreign tax credit exceeds this amount, the difference up to 35% can be used against final taxes (surtax in the case of Chilean individuals and additional withholding tax in the case of foreigners earning Chilean-sourced income).\n\nAlso, if a foreign investment is held through different layers abroad, Chilean tax law allows the use of foreign tax credits, even if the corporate taxes are paid by entities indirectly held abroad, as long as the distributing entity is domiciled in the same country and it holds directly or indirectly an equity interest of more than 10%.\n\nUnder a tax change in 2020, if the corporate income tax is paid in a third country, different from the distributing country, corporate income taxes paid can also be used as a credit in Chile, as long as the distributing entity holds directly or indirectly an equity interest of more than 10% and the third country has an enforceable double tax treaty with Chile or an exchange of information agreement.\n\nThe bill\n\nIn March 2022, Gabriel Boric became the Chilean president. In his presidential programme, he announced a very ambitious tax reform that was presented before the Congress on July 7 2022.\n\nAmong the proposed amendments, the bill states that the current maximum foreign tax credit of 35% should be reduced to 27% and should only be applicable to corporate income tax and not to final taxes. Also, the indirect tax credit mechanism is proposed to be fully repealed.\n\nIf this is approved, in the author’s opinion, foreign investment and using Chile as a business platform will become less attractive, since the amount of foreign tax credits will be significantly lower, increasing the Chilean tax burden.",

    "Blog: Chile's Boric wasted an opportunity for Palestine at the UN General Assembly": "Chilean President Gabriel Boric may currently be the most outspoken leader in Latin America on Palestinian rights and Israeli violations. However, his rhetoric leaves much to be desired. It, in turn, raises questions about how Chile – the country with the largest Palestinian community in the region – can differentiate itself from other countries to become a model to follow, rather than following international consensus over the two-state compromise and Israel's security narrative.\n\nIn his first address to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), Boric spoke about Palestine's right to freedom and sovereignty while mangling his message by including a false equivalence with Israel that eliminates the colonial context. \"[Palestinian people] should yield to their inalienable right to establish their own free and sovereign state. In the same way, [let's] guarantee Israel's legitimate right to live within secure and internationally recognised borders,\" Boric asserted.\n\nBoric's speech was pronounced \"politically correct\", while noting that Chile's stance has always advocated for the recognition of Palestinian people's rights and Israel's rights while promoting the two-state compromise, like the rest of the international community. In which case, Boric's activist stances as president are unlikely to leave any impact on Chilean diplomacy. Under Boric, the Chilean government is advocating for the same stance that his predecessor Sebastian Pinera adhered to, which is a bonus for Israel, despite the grievances Israeli media aired upon Boric's electoral victory.\n\nREAD: The EU should stop exploiting Palestinian NGOs\n\nDays before his UNGA speech, Boric postponed accepting the credentials of the new Israeli ambassador to Chile, Gil Artzyeli, in response to the Israeli forces' killing of 17-year-old Palestinian Odai Trad Salah in Kufr Dan near Jenin. However, his stance, which made headline news in major media outlets worldwide, was diminished by the UNGA speech that attempted equivalence between the coloniser and the colonised while simplifying, to the point of obliteration, the reason why Palestinians are deprived of a state, possibly permanently.\n\nBoric is not unaware of the Palestinian plight as a result of Zionist colonisation. Neither is he oblivious to the fact that Palestinians and the indigenous people of Chile – the Mapuche – have suffered similar forms of aggression because of governments criminalising their struggle for land reclamation and political autonomy. Yet, it is possible that, as president, Boric's activist stances will be mellowed by diplomatic requirements, such as abiding by the two-state compromise, which has failed Palestinians and become defunct in all but international rhetoric.\n\nPrior to the presidency, Boric stood out as one of the most vocal activists in Chile. As president, Boric is navigating a complex reality that includes the legacy of Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship and ties to Israel during that period, as well as the country's reliance on securing military and surveillance equipment from Palestine's oppressors.\n\nTo cast Israel and legitimacy together is an aberration, particularly when using such descriptions to balance advocating for Palestinian rights. Boric wasted an opportunity at his first UNGA speech to call out Israel's colonial violence and how it invalidates legitimacy. It is not up to the international community to guarantee Israel's existence, but Boric knows that Chile can play a pivotal role in ensuring that the international community gravitates towards the legitimacy of the Palestinian people's political demands.\n\nREAD: Chile President refuses Israeli ambassador's credentials over Israel's killing of Palestinians\n\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Monitor.",

    "Human mobility in Chile: Coordination and response of UNHCR, partners and donors during 2021 - Chile": "PROLOGUE\n\nThe last two years of the pandemic have been devastating. Border closures increased the departure of people from countries where they suffer persecution, intolerance or human rights violations. In fact, just considering Venezuela, there are already 6 million human beings who left their home in search of a safer place to restart their lives.\n\nThe risks have been dramatic. During the journey, many of them faced conditions that put their lives in check, such as extreme climates, complex geographies, in addition to human trafficking and trafficking criminal networks. In addition, the increase in xenophobia is added as an unfortunate consequence of this situation.\n\nThis scenario has challenged us to strengthen international cooperation and intensify our capacity to respond to this crisis, because poverty and inequality have increased in the region, affecting the most vulnerable people, such as refugees. Thousands of them continue to rely on humanitarian aid to eat and sleep, while access to education and health are a privilege for many families.\n\nThat is why fostering effective local integration becomes one of the biggest challenges to offer long-term solutions that guarantee health, education, housing, among other essential services for refugee and migrant people.\n\nThe world is living in complex times and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the displacement generated by the armed conflict is an unfortunate example that justifies the existence of agencies such as UNHCR to protect people. In addition to this situation that marked the beginning of 2022, in Latin America we continue to face the COVID-19 pandemic and the largest exodus in the history of our region.\n\nFor our Southern Cone region, and especially for our Regional Office covering Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay, obstacles to access to territory and refugee status determination procedures were of great concern in 2021. In this regard, UNHCR advocated to the governments to maintain entry exceptions for people in need of protection, in addition to resuming asylum procedures and implementing alternative options for refugee and migrant people to virtually register their applications or adopt remote interview modalities, among other exceptions.We also work in coordination with civil society, government human rights institutions and public defenders to ensure access in specific cases identified by the office. We made strategic progress with specialized partners who have identified cases, provided support and intervened with the authorities in order to guarantee access to territory and refugee status determination procedures.\n\nSince 2020, thanks to the impact of UNHCR, Uruguay has maintained entry exceptions to authorize access to the territory of people in need of international protection and guaranteed access to the determination of refugee status, RSD procedure, which it does not happened in the other countries. In addition, UNHCR supported the Permanent Secretariat of the National Refugee Commission (CORE) in the development of an abbreviated procedure to analyse and resolve the asylum applications of Venezuelans, which was approved and implemented. The CORE recognized 189 Venezuelan nationals during 2021.\n\nFollowing UNHCR’s advocacy and proposals, Argentina adopted a protocol for conducting remote refugee status determination interviews.In the case of Paraguay, it continued to apply a prima facie approach to Venezuelans and other nationalities, recognising 2,148 Venezuelans and 653 Cubans during 2021.And in Chile, thanks to the support of our donors and the excellent coordination work with our partners, important advances were made that you will know in the next pages.Thus, we can proudly say that the Southern Cone reached great achievements.\n\nIn 2021, together, Argentina, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay, supported more than 15,000 people with health consultations; more than 12,000 with non-food items; 5,000 people with shelter and temporary accommodation; and more than 13,500 with cash assistance. More than 21,500 people were able to obtain counselling and 28,000 were provided with legal assistance. And a particularly relevant fact for our operation: we support more than 200 victims of the scourge of gender violence. Numbers are important because they give a true dimension to the work in the territory, although even more important are the people behind the numbers.\n\nBut we still have a big task ahead of us. The emergency is not over and the work, especially with the host communities, is more necessary than ever. To meet all these needs, we must continue to work as a team. That is why I invite and motivate all the actors of society so that we do not lower our arms. The world is giving us a great lesson and responding with a gesture of humanity and solidarity is the great door to continue saving lives.PROLOGUE / JUAN CARLOS MURILLOUNHCR /HUMAN MOBILITY IN CHILE",

Her refrigerator was old and unreliable, and she never knew if the temperature was cool enough to store the drug.\n\nNot only was the fridge imperilling her insulin supplies, it was also causing her food to rot, driving up her electricity bills, and hurting the environment.\n\nCordero, who lives in Santiago, the capital of Chile, does not have a lot of money to spend on appliances. But thanks to United for Efficiency (U4E), a United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)-led initiative backed by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), she was able to secure a new, energy-efficient refrigerator.\n\n“It gives me so much joy to have a new fridge. I’ve never had a new one before; now I can keep my insulin fresh,” said Cordero, who added the fridge costs about US$7 a month to operate, down from US$30 for her old one.\n\nIn 2018, U4E established a programme in Chile, with support from Fundación Chile, the Ministry of Energy and private companies such as Hisense, Samsung and Whirlpool, to help consumers access new, energy-efficient refrigerators.",
    "Diplomatic spat after Chile leader snubs new Israeli ambassador": "Chilean President Boric postponed meeting with Israeli envoy following Israeli army killing of Palestinian boy on the same day.\n\nA diplomatic tussle intensified after Chile’s president put off accepting the credentials of Israel’s new ambassador to Santiago over the killing in the occupied West Bank of a Palestinian teenager.\n\nIn response, Israel’s foreign ministry summoned Chilean ambassador Jorge Carvajal for what it called a reprimand at a meeting where, it said, “Israel’s response will be made clear.”\n\nThe dispute began on Thursday when Chilean foreign minister Antonia Urrejola informed newly appointed Israeli ambassador Gil Artzyeli that Chilean President Gabriel Boric was postponing a meeting to accept his credentials until October.\n\n“That’s because today is a sensitive day because of the death of a minor,” a spokesperson from Chile’s ministry of foreign affairs said in a text message, referring to the death of Odai Trad Salah, the 17-year-old Palestinian boy that day.\n\nSalah was shot in the head by Israeli forces in the village of Kufr Dan near the occupied West Bank city of Jenin, becoming the 149th Palestinian to be killed by Israel this year.\n\nIsrael assailed the snub on Friday with its foreign ministry labelling it “puzzling and unprecedented behaviour” and adding in its statement: “This seriously harms the relations between the two countries.”\n\n1/2 Israel views with severity the puzzling & unprecedented behavior of Chile.

In a television interview last year, Boric, who became Chile’s president in March, was asked if he maintained his earlier stated opinion that Israel is a “genocidal and murderous” state.\n\n“I maintain it,” he answered.\n\nIn 2019, Chile’s Jewish community sent Boric a jar of honey to celebrate the Jewish New Year.

    "MARAD working with Chile to improve security at ports": "In addressing port security in Guyana, Minister of Public Works Juan Edghill has said regulations, training and enhanced inspections of vessels must be balanced to avoid wasted investment.\n\nThe Minister was speaking at the opening of a port security workshop on Monday, when he expounded on illegalities at the country’s entry ports and said this is an issue that the government is continuously trying to tackle.\n\nThe workshop focuses on Port Security and was facilitated after discussions between the Public Works Minister and the Chile Ambassador to Guyana Juan Manuel Pino Vasquez.\n\nThe booming oil sector has created opportunities for Guyana. However, it has also created a new avenue for illegal activities, especially at the border. With this in mind, the Minister said port security needs to be of paramount importance.\n\n“We don’t have people who are properly oriented and trained and equipped with particular world views and perspective to ensure the safety and security of our nations’ sake, it will be a waste of investments,” the Public Works Minister said.\n\nTherefore, he added, “Our government must balance its investment in hardware as well as in human resource development, capacity building institutional strengthening and it is in that collaborative spirit that we engaged Chile in a continuing engagement of the developing of our human resource capacity and strengthening our institution.”\n\nFurther, Edghill said there will be newer monitoring systems in place to ensure that the staff working at ports are not turning a blind eye. One such initiative is part of discussions the Minister is having with MARAD.\n\n“There are a number of new initiatives that we are wondering and deliberating on. And one of the key initiatives that they (MARAD) are talking to me about is ensuring that the people who work at all of our ports are not just cleared by their employer but also cleared by MARAD.”\n\n“We have to prevent the movement of illegal goods through our port…We are working on ensuring that we see everything that happens in all our ports by putting in the necessary infrastructure. We have to ensure that the people who work there are not facilitating illegalities,” he explained.\n\nThe Minister also noted that in order to become better, Guyana must embrace international best practices. As such he expressed gratitude to the government of Chile for extending training of practices used in Chile to Guyanese.",

One of the problems with the current constitution is the inclusion of private sector involvement in education, pensions and health care.\n\nDemocracy was eventually restored in 1990, yet no Constitution had since been created to reflect the change in government.\n\nTherefore, in a 2020 referendum, roughly 80% of Chileans voted in favor of drafting a new Constitution — yet the latest one was apparently not the best fit for the country, .said by many to be too progressive.\n\nThe constitution draft included 388 articles focused on reforming issues such as legalizing abortion, gender parity in government offices, abolishing Chile’s senate, establishing autonomous Indigenous territories, improving educational rights, housing and pensions as well as the right to universal health care and new environmental protections that would limit the copper industry.\n\nAt this year’s referendum to adopt or reject the new Constitution, 62% of Chileans voted against, describing it as too progressive and too dramatic of a shift that the nation could not withstand at the moment.\n\nAs the latest constitution was rejected, the majority of Chileans still call for an updated, progressive constitution, just one that reflects more of the values of the country.\n\nEducational reform takes center stage at protests\n\nAnita Serrano Bezan, a 22-year-old trainee teacher from Chile, , explains that her experiences working as an online teacher during the COVID-19 pandemic have revealed many problems within the Chilean education system.\n\nSome of the biggest issues within the system include socioeconomic inequality, technological gaps, and gender discrimination.\n\nAccording to Bazán, “In my time working and studying in Chilean schools, I have observed that teachers tend to reserve the most challenging math and science activities for boys, which discourages girls from seeking leadership roles in these fields,” said Bazán.\n\nIn correlation, statistics show women are underrepresented among STEM graduates and professionals — only one in three researchers in Chile being women.\n\nSocioeconomic status is also a big concern in the education sector. According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, tuition fees for public schools in Chile are among the highest in the world with only six out of 10 Chilean families able to pay the high cost of education.\n\nSocioeconomic status in education is deepening further with the presence of online education, as technological gaps such as internet access provide less of a chance for families across Chile to receive necessary education.\n\nA survey conducted in 2021 found that 73% of Chileans had difficulties using online education during the pandemic and that a large digital divide exists between urban and rural areas, with 60% of Chile’s rural population lacking internet access in contrast to 40.9% of the rural populations that do have access.\n\nHowever, educational reform is just one of the issues citizens of Chile want to be addressed. With the latest constitution already in the trash — one that had taken years to draft — it appears that none of them will be addressed until Chilean lawmakers manage to draft a constitution that is progressive but not too progressive, and which implies change – but not too much, and not too quickly.",

    "Chile rejects its new constitution": "Chile rejects its new constitution\n\nChile has voted a resounding NO to a proposed constitution that would have put a focus on social issues and gender parity, enshrine rights for the indigenous population, and address climate change.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nIn Chile, a special assembly has spent the past two years writing a new constitution, and it was supposed to replace the current one that dates back to the country's military dictatorship. But yesterday, voters soundly rejected the new constitution in a referendum and then celebrated in the streets of Santiago.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF CAR HORNS HONKING, CHEERING)\n\nMARTIN: NPR's John Otis is just back from a reporting trip to Chile, and he joins us now. Good morning, John.\n\nJOHN OTIS, BYLINE: Good morning. It's good to be here.\n\nMARTIN: So people clearly excited. Tell us what this rejection means.\n\nOTIS: Well, the rejection means a huge blow for Chile's president, Gabriel Boric. He was a really big supporter of this new constitution. But nearly 62% of Chileans voted against it, compared to just 38% in favor. In fact, the outcome became so clear so quickly that the campaign for approval conceded defeat less than two hours after the polls closed.\n\nMARTIN: Wow. I mean, they clearly didn't have the right political temperature on how this was going to go over with voters. Why was it so controversial, this new constitution?\n\nOTIS: You know, some have called it the world's most progressive constitution. For example, it would have vastly expanded rights for Indigenous groups and created more protections for the environment. It would have made - it would have mandated universal health care, as well as the right to decent housing, education and pensions, and it calls for gender parity in government and legalized abortion. But Chile is actually quite a conservative place. Married couples couldn't even get divorced in Chile until 2004.\n\nSome of this new constitution might have hurt the economy because, for example, stricter environmental rules might have put the brakes on the copper and lithium mining industries. It would have meant higher taxes to pay for a lot of these new government benefits included in the constitution. There was also a disinformation campaign that spread lies about it. And finally, you know, the best constitutions are usually short and to the point, but this one was really long. It had 388 articles, and it was - just ended up being too much for voters to digest.\n\nMARTIN: Yeah. So if you could just step back for a moment, explain what was behind this movement to draft a new constitution in the first place?\n\nOTIS: Well, there were two reasons. First, anti-government protests back in 2019 nearly brought down Chile's government. To calm the waters and to address protesters' concerns about poverty and inequality, a special assembly began writing a new constitution. The other reason is that the current one was written back in 1980. That's when dictator Augusto Pinochet ruled Chile. Democracy was restored in 1990. And when most countries go through such momentous political changes, they write new rules of the game, new governing guidelines, but Chile never really got around to that until now.\n\nMARTIN: So, I mean, what happens? Is the effort to change the constitution dead at this point?\n\nOTIS: It's not dead. President Boric went on Chilean TV last night and claimed that the effort to forge a new constitution isn't over. Let's take a listen.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT GABRIEL BORIC: (Speaking Spanish).\n\nOTIS: So Boric is saying here that he plans to meet with Congress and civil society in the coming days to try to start this process all over again. This was expected because in spite of last night's rejection, polls show that Chileans don't like their Pinochet-era constitution either. But Boric has said whoever drafts the next version of the constitution, they're going to have to come up with something that unites Chileans rather than divides them, like this one did.\n\nMARTIN: John Otis reporting for NPR.

    "For the time being, the left wing-vision for Chile has not come true": "Jubilant media and policy analysts were ready to celebrate the “world’s most progressive constitution”, but more than 60% of Chile’s citizens voted against it. The draft was overambitious and included regulations for twoo topics.\n\nIt was supposed to be brilliant, but Chile‘s people did not approve the new constitution in the referendum of 4 September. Its proponents had hoped it would become the crowning glory of a reform process that had started three years ago. The new constitution was supposed to be socially more equitable, more modern and more environment friendly.\n\nThe reform process started with a wave of protests against poverty and inequality in 2019. In a referendum in 2020, 80% of voters opted for drafting a new constitution (at the time, , Javier A. Cisterna Figueroa assessed matters on www.dandc.eu). The current constitution dates back to 1980 and is a legacy of the Pinochet dictatorship, emphasising its authoritarian attitudes and free-market orthodoxy.\n\nIn May 2021, a constitutional assembly (Convención) was elected. In December. Gabriel Boric, a young leftist, won the presidential election. He took office in March as the successor of conservative leader Sebastián Piñera (siehe comment by Javier A. Cisterna Figueroa on www.dandc.eu). This summer, the convention published its draft constitution. It contained explicit rights to healthcare, shelter, education, elderly care, internet access as well as clean air and water. It foresaw specific rights for indigenous peoples and included protections for animals and ecosystems.\n\nThe voters did not appreciate it. For several reasons, over 60% voted “no”.\n\nMany controversial issues\n\nFirst of all, the draft text was very long and excessively detailed. It included 388 articles covering a host of issues, including, for example, healthy nutrition, gender parity in public institutions and an individual’s sexual orientation. Some of these points were quite contentious.\n\nOpponents of the draft took advantage of related controversies in their “rechazo” (rejection) campaign. Web-based disinformation helped them spread fears. The state would nationalise people’s private properties, it was falsely argued, and a communist dictatorship was said to be preprogrammed.\n\nOn the other hand, many voters indeed disagreed with specific points of the draft constitution. There is no consensus on whether there should be a right to abortion , for example. Some institutional changes, including the abolition of the Senate, were controversial as well.\n\nA crisis of trust\n\nIt equally mattered that the Convención itself was not beyond criticism. Polls showed that, in many people’s eyes, its legitimacy was dented due to various scandals. Right-wing agitation further contributed to undermining public trust.\n\nUltimately, the referendum was thus about party politics. The opposition campaigned to reject the proposal, whereas the government endorsed it. Instead of focusing on long-term principles, debate increasingly revolve around day-to-day politics.\n\nA constitution, however, differs from a political party’s platform. In as few words and clauses as possible, it should define basic values and spell out how a nation will govern itself, how laws will be passed and how the law courts will operate. What the Convención proposed, by contrast, rather resembled the demands spelled out in a left-wing party’s election manifesto.\n\nThe constitutional process will go on. The Senate has already approved a roadmap. It starts with the election of a new constitutional assembly, which will have the opportunity to do a better job, focusing less on detailed regulations concerning a multitude of issues and paying more attention to all citizens feeling represented. The advice of an expert board is expected to enhance the credibility of decisions, moreover. A crucial point is that the opposition must not be able to systematically cast doubt on the entire process once more.\n\nEva-Maria Verfürth is a freelance author.

    "Chile's new constitution is put to the test at a vote": "Chile's new constitution is put to the test at a vote\n\nChile is debating a new constitution, to replace the one written during the country's 17-year-military dictatorship. Now it'll be ratified - or rejected - by voters in a September 4th referendum.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nThree years ago, anti-government demonstrations swept across Chile. They have now led to big change for the country on the Pacific coast of South America. A special assembly has written an entirely new constitution which must be ratified or rejected. NPR's John Otis is there.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED SINGER: (Singing in non-English language).\n\nJOHN OTIS, BYLINE: Folk musicians fire up the crowd here in the Chilean capital of Santiago. Hundreds have gathered to show their support for a new constitution. It would replace the old one that was written during the country's military dictatorship that lasted for 17 years.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish).\n\n(CHEERING)\n\nOTIS: It was a brutal period. In fact, this event is taking place just outside the national soccer stadium. It was turned into a concentration camp in 1973 when General Augusto Pinochet seized power and began arresting his opponents.\n\nANDRES SOLIMANO: Many people was killed here. They used torture, disappearance. It has a very sad history.\n\nOTIS: That's Andres Solimano, who at the time of the coup was in high school and saw several of his classmates arrested. Even though Chile is now a democracy, he points out that Chile's constitution was written during the dictatorship.\n\nSOLIMANO: Thirty-two years after the end of the Pinochet regime in 1990, we still have that constitution. So it's very much a due constitutional change.\n\nOTIS: There are other reasons why Chileans want to reset the rules for their nation.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish).\n\nOTIS: Despite years of economic growth, there's a large gap between rich and poor. That, plus low wages and rising costs for transportation, health care and education, led to violent protests in 2019.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST)\n\nOTIS: About 30 protesters were killed, and hundreds were injured. To calm the waters, the government agreed to a constitutional rewrite. Last year, Chileans elected a special assembly that spent 12 months drafting the new Magna Carta.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nOTIS: I pick up a copy at a kiosk in front of the presidential palace. It's long, with nearly 400 articles. Some strengthen women's rights, including the right to abortion. Others call for more protection for the environment and Indigenous groups and for better access to housing, education and pensions. But to guarantee more rights, Chile's left-wing government, which has been in power since March, will have to spend more, says political analyst Claudio Fuentes.\n\nSo all this is going to cost a lot of money.\n\nCLAUDIO FUENTES: For sure. And then the question will be taxes.\n\nOTIS: Indeed, the specter of higher taxes and more state intervention in the economy has turned off many Chileans, including retired police officer Hector Yanez.\n\nHECTOR YANEZ: (Speaking Spanish).\n\nOTIS: He says the current constitution opened the door for the best period of economic growth in Chile's history. There's also been a major TV campaign to convince Chileans to vote against ratification on September 4.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Speaking Spanish).\n\nOTIS: This TV spot claims, falsely, that the new constitution will provide more rights to criminals than to their victims. The negative messaging seems to be working. Recent polls show more Chileans plan to reject the new constitution than ratify it. If so, it would be a blow to President Gabriel Boric.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT GABRIEL BORIC: (Speaking Spanish).\n\nOTIS: In a recent interview on Chilean TV, Boric said he found it hard to imagine that the no-vote would prevail.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBORIC: (Speaking Spanish).\n\nOTIS: But if it does, Boric said, this isn't the end. Instead, he said, Chileans would go back to square one and start the constitutional rewrite process all over again.\n\nJohn Otis, NPR News, Santiago, Chile.\n\nCopyright © 2022 NPR.

    "What's next for Chile after voters rejected a new constitution": "What's next for Chile after voters rejected a new constitution\n\nNPR's Ari Shapiro speaks with Antonia Laborde, a reporter for El País in Santiago de Chile after voters in the country rejected a new constitution. Now the country must consider a new path forward.\n\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\n\nNow that voters in Chile have rejected a new constitution, where does the country go from here? The proposal was full of progressive ideals - universal health care, Indigenous rights, abortion protections. And voters shot it down on Sunday by a margin of more than 20 points. Antonia Laborde is a correspondent in Santiago for El Pais, and she's here to talk about the path forward. Welcome.\n\nANTONIA LABORDE: Hello. Thank you for inviting me.\n\nSHAPIRO: President Gabriel Boric is already talking about a process that would lead to another constitutional proposal. And today he announced a new cabinet. How does he believe a second attempt to pass a new constitution would go differently from the first?\n\nLABORDE: Well, President Boric has called the leaders of the political parties and Congress to define how they will continue the constitutional process that he obviously supports. But it will be the Congress that defines the rules of this new game. Now, Boric may stand out a bit and focus more on governing. Surely we will see the president more focused on security and economic issues now.\n\nSHAPIRO: I'm curious what voters are telling you. When you talk to Chileans, what do they tell you about their reasons for rejecting the new constitution?\n\nLABORDE: Well, I heard the most enlightening thing in a town called San Pedro de Melipilla. This was the municipality of the metropolitan region that had participated the least in the entry referendum in October 2020. On that occasion, the vote was voluntary. And the people had to answer whether or not they want any constitution. On Sunday, the vote was mandatory. I can say two things here. There was a huge lack of information. They knew little, and what they knew was often not true. And second, for many, it was a referendum on the management of Boric, not the constitutional proposal.\n\nSHAPIRO: Two years ago, four out of five Chilean voters wanted to scrap the old constitution. So do you see a contradiction between that vote and this one? Is there a way to move forward and bridge those two realities?\n\nLABORDE: Well, in my point of view, since the riot of 2019, the political class is much more polarized than the citizens. People took the streets massively to protest against the inequalities in this country. Later, they may simply choose to change the Constitution. For me, the division is in the elite and not in the streets. The people want changes, but they simply felt that the constitutional proposal didn't suit them.\n\nSHAPIRO: How big of a factor was misinformation?\n\nLABORDE: Well, it was undoubtedly an election marred by fake news. The people against the proposal say that the new constitution will eliminate the flag, that it will be possible to abort up to nine months of pregnancy. Another recurring falsehood was been the private property will be confiscated under the new constitution. You know that we're living in times when social media campaigns are full of fake news, and it's very difficult to stop them. But save that, I think that it's important to clarify that the 3 million-plus voters who reject the proposal can't be attributed to fake news alone only.\n\nSHAPIRO: Yeah. This was a major blow to President Boric. Is he the man to lead the country into its next chapter? Do you think he can recover from this?\n\nLABORDE: Well, I think that this is an opportunity for Gabriel Boric. He can become the president who leaves behind a new constitution. So we may see decisions that are not very popular for the hardest left but more helpful for agreements. So we will see.\n\nSHAPIRO: That's Antonia Laborde, a journalist based in Santiago reporting for El Pais. Thank you very much.\n\nLABORDE: Thank you.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SLUM VILLAGE SONG, \"FALL IN LOVE\")\n\nCopyright © 2022 NPR. All rights reserved.

    "Chile looks to increase seafood consumption in the Northeast and Midwest through a partnership with Giant Eagle": "Through the \"Chile on Board\" campaign, which will run until November 9th, the country will be able to promote two of its most important products: salmon and mussels.\n\nPHILADELPHIA, Sept. 26, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- ProChile, the institution in charge of promoting Chilean exports, set up a partnership with Giant Eagle, a leading food, fuel, and pharmacy retailer, to boost seafood consumption in the Northeast and Midwest regions.\n\nThe \"Chile on Board\" campaign will run until November 9th in Giant Eagle stores throughout Indiana, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. The initiative will focus on two of the most relevant Chilean products at the international level: salmon and mussels.\n\n\"Seafood is a common product on both coasts of the United States, but not so much in the hinterland of the country. With this campaign, we want the consumers unfamiliar with these foods to get to know those that Chile can offer and their benefits,\" said Alexander Grabois, representative of the ProChile commercial office in Philadelphia.\n\nGrabois explained that \"thanks to Chile's geography and vast water from the Pacific Ocean, the Chilean seafood industry offers a great variety of food that is remarkable in terms of freshness and quality.\"\n\n\"Giant Eagle is proud to partner with ProChile,\" said Giant Eagle Director of Seafood Rich Castle. \"We will be running a sales contest sponsored by ProChile, with the winning Team Members earning an educational and fun trip to Chile salmon and mussel farms. The winning Seafood Team Leaders will experience the pristine marine environment and sustainable efforts that will allow them to educate our guests about salmon and mussel farming in Chile.\"\n\nThe U.S., the leading market for salmon\n\nGrabois explained that, in the case of salmon, Chile is the second-largest exporter in the world and that the United States is the leading market for this product. \"Given the conditions of the southernmost sea in the world, the Chilean salmon has unparallel characteristics in terms of freshness,\" he said.\n\nAccording to him, \"Chilean salmon is a food with a high content of protein and unique flavor that provides a highly nutritious, healthy, and sustainable diet. Besides, it is easy to cook and quite versatile.\"\n\nFood innocuousness and sustainability are other features of this product. \"More than 70% of the salmon companies in Chile are certified for their good practices,\" he added.\n\nThe ProChile representative stressed that \"this industry plays a key role in the development of the South of Chile, not only due to the jobs that are created —70 thousand people work in this sector— but also due to the innovations of the goods and services that are exported to the rest of the world.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Chilean mussel is a high-quality product that is 100% natural, hatched in the cleanest and coldest South Pacific waters that come from Antarctica. \"It is a healthy, nutritious, and delicious product that represents the best of the Chilean shellfish,\" said Pedro Ovalle, president of the Commercial Committee at AmiChile, the mussel farmers association.\n\n\"Just like salmon, most companies that produce mussels have innocuousness and sustainability certification,\" added Ovalle. He also highlighted that \"the U.S. market leads the industry's export growth, with a 3.7% annual rise between January and July of 2022, compared with a 12.7% drop in global terms.\"\n\nGrabois invited people who live in Indiana, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia to visit the nearest Giant Eagle to learn about the more than 30 available products, among them fresh salmon, frozen salmon, Coho salmon, ready-to-eat salmon, dressed salmon, stuffed salmon, and mussels.\n\n\"Both salmon and mussels can be cooked and eaten with other Chilean products that are very well-known worldwide, such as olive oil, wine, and fruits,\" said the ProChile representative.\n\nAbout ProChile:\n\nProChile is an institution of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that promotes the sale of Chilean goods and services worldwide.\n\nThrough a network of more than 50 international offices and 16 offices in different regions of Chile, teams of specialized professionals work to strengthen the country's position in international markets, spread opportunities to invest in Chile, and promote tourism. ProChile has 11 offices in North America that provide top-level information to Chilean importers and exporters to generate ties and detect new opportunities.\n\nFor more information: www.prochile.gob.cl\n\nAbout Giant Eagle:\n\nGiant Eagle, Inc., ranked among the top 40 on Forbes magazine's largest private corporations list, is one of the nation's largest food retailers and distributors with approximately $10 billion in annual sales. Founded in 1931, Giant Eagle, Inc. has grown to be a leading food, fuel, and pharmacy retailer in the region with more than 470 stores throughout western Pennsylvania, Ohio, northern West Virginia, Maryland, and Indiana.\n\nSOURCE ProChile",

    "Misinformation abounds as Chile prepares to vote on new constitution": "Chile is heading towards a historic plebiscite on a new constitution to replace the document drawn up during Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship, but the vote will take place amid a climate of uncertainty driven by a storm of falsehoods and divisive campaigns.\n\nFor weeks, television advertising spots, street canvassers and social media campaigns have attempted to sway opinion towards the two options which will appear on the ballot this Sunday: “approve” or “reject”.\n\n“We’re inundated with a tsunami of information,” said former advertising executive Eugenio García, 69, “Nowadays, it’s hard to tell what’s true, false, biased or malicious.”\n\nGarcía helped craft the campaign calling on Chileans to say no to eight more years of Pinochet’s rule in a previous plebiscite in the spring of 1988. They did so by a narrow margin.\n\n“There are similarities between then and now in that they want to change the moral fabric of the country,” said García, “But what is at stake this time is actually far greater – it is part of a global change.”\n\nOver 12 months, a democratically elected gender-equal convention, representing a vast range of agendas and political stances, worked to draft the new constitution.\n\nThe result of the process, presented in July, is a remarkably progressive document enshrining gender equality and Indigenous rights, expanding social protections and guaranteeing environmental protection.\n\nHowever, criticism has been levelled at its shake-up of the political system, which detractors argue was not the cause of the country’s discontent. Others have labelled the proposed constitution a “wishlist” of rights that will be hard to put into practice.\n\nPolling has consistently suggested that Chileans will reject the proposal in the referendum, in which everybody aged 18 or over must vote.\n\nBut if the constitution is approved, it will replace the 1980 document which, despite significant reforms, retains the ideological fingerprints of the Pinochet dictatorship under which it was drafted without democratic input.\n\nMapuche Indigenous people hold flags of approval of the new constitution in Temuco, Chile, this month. Photograph: Mario Quilodran/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAn insidious trend of misinformation has weighed heavily on the process since October 2020, when Chileans voted overwhelmingly in favour of drafting a new constitution.\n\n“With the first plebiscite there was a boom of misinformation,” said Valentina Matus, the editor of Contexto Factual.\n\n“Even though there wasn’t anything written yet, they were already saying that you could have your house taken away,” remembered Matus.\n\nDuring a televised campaign in 2021, a rightwing party falsely claimed that the new constitution would change Chile’s national anthem, flag – and even the name of the country.\n\nOnline, the daily swirl of false announcements and misleading interpretations of the text have made fact-checking difficult.\n\n“There are constant examples of statements that I don’t consider outright lies, but rather exaggerations,” said Eduardo Arriagada, an adjunct professor at the Pontifical Catholic University’s communications faculty in Santiago.\n\n“Constitutions don’t usually give details, they give broad definitions and allow for a range of scenarios for the law to sort out later, but that leaves them open to interpretation.”\n\nPredictably, the most emotive topics have been foregrounded.\n\nIn May, Senator Felipe Kast claimed that under the new constitution, abortion would be permitted up to the ninth month of a pregnancy. The text enshrines reproductive rights, but explicitly leaves the details up to the law.\n\nAnother recurring falsehood has been that private property could be confiscated under the new constitution.\n\nAmong the more outlandish claims, a website whose design mimicked that of the constitutional convention claimed that deprivatising the country’s water rights would outlaw the sale of bottled water and bags of ice for summer barbecues.\n\nIn response to a wave of false social media posts, one congressman even presented a bill in late July that would sanction sharing fake news about the constitution with a fine of around 33m pesos (£31,000).\n\n“From day one, the campaign against the new constitution manipulated what I said and sowed lies,” said Elisa Loncón, who represented the Indigenous Mapuche people in the convention and was elected its first president.\n\n“What they want is to silence and minimise us. All of the Mapuche women in the convention were subject to these attacks.”\n\nPeople demonstrate against the draft of the new constitution in Santiago at the weekend. Photograph: Martin Bernetti/AFP/Getty Images\n\nConfidence in the process was also rocked by scandal when a delegate was dishonourably excluded from the convention in September last year.\n\nA newspaper investigation revealed that Rodrigo Rojas Vade had falsely claimed to suffer from a rare form of leukaemia – the premise for his election as a campaigner for serious illnesses – and eventually resigned his seat.\n\nMore recently, activists on the fringe right have copied the tactics of the far-right leaders Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro, attacking Chile’s electoral service and hinting that they may not accept the result of the referendum.\n\nDespite the campaign, few seriously doubt the integrity of Chile’s electoral process. In its 2022 country report on Chile, the Freedom House NGO gave Chilean democracy a rating of 94 out of 100 – the second highest in Latin America – concluding that “Chile’s electoral framework is robust and generally well implemented”.\n\nBut efforts to allow Chileans to make an informed choice on Sunday have often met with resistance.\n\n“With misinformation getting there first, it’s hard to make sure the truth or fact-checking has the same reach,” said Matus.\n\n“Lies about emotional subjects will always outrun efforts to debunk them.”",
    "Chile loses FIFA appeal in World Cup case with Ecuador": "FIFA dismissed Chile’s argument that Ecuador player Castillo was Colombian and ineligible to play at the World Cup.\n\nChile has lost its appeal to the world governing body challenging Ecuador’s place at the upcoming football World Cup in Qatar.\n\nFIFA on Friday dismissed Chile’s argument that Ecuadorian player Byron Castillo was actually Colombian and ineligible to play in World Cup qualifying games. Castillo played in eight qualifiers for Ecuador.\n\nThe organisation said its appeal judges “deemed that on the basis of the documents presented, the player was to be considered as holding permanent Ecuadorian nationality in accordance” with football’s legal statutes.\n\nThe verdict, which upholds a FIFA disciplinary ruling from June, has kept Chile out of the tournament and Ecuador on track to face Qatar in the opening game of the World Cup in Doha on November 20.\n\nHowever, Chile’s legal challenge can continue.\n\nThe Chilean football federation can now appeal against FIFA’s verdict to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Lausanne, Switzerland. CAS, sport’s highest court, can organise an urgent hearing and give a ruling in the nine weeks left until the World Cup begins.\n\nChile claimed to have evidence proving Castillo is Colombian and should never have played for Ecuador.\n\nChile prepared its case after the World Cup draw was made on April 1, and after FIFA and Qatari organisers sold thousands of tickets and accommodation rooms to Ecuador fans.\n\nFIFA Appeal Committee passes decision on eligibility of player Byron David Castillo Segura ▶️ https://t.co/PLMHOL0ARb pic.twitter.com/2bXTvD9jCL — FIFA Media (@fifamedia) September 16, 2022\n\nHad Ecuador forfeited all eight games Castillo played, Chile would have risen to the fourth automatic qualification place in the South American qualifying group. Ecuador would have dropped out of contention.\n\nFIFA’s legal statutes include a section on national team eligibility when a state government has granted citizenship to players.\n\n“Any person holding a permanent nationality that is not dependent on residence in a certain country is eligible to play for the representative teams of the association of that country,” according to the statutes.\n\nThe FIFA appeals committee rarely overturns a ruling by the football body’s disciplinary committee. Chile has filed complaints against an opponent’s player in back-to-back World Cup qualifying programmes.",

Mikaela Åhlin-Kottulinksy and four-time World Rallycross king Johan Kristoffersson got their Chile weekend off to a strong start by topping qualifying and, although they were second in the heat, they won their semi-final. Loeb and Gutiérréz won their semi too, seemingly ensuring the title protagonists would face off as usual in the final. But disaster struck for Rosberg, when a software glitch meant RXR missed the deadline to make the grid for the climax – the first time in two seasons that the inaugural champion team hadn’t raced in the final.\n\nThat meant Chip Ganassi Racing made a surprise last-minute appearance as first reserve, joining Acciona Sainz and Abt Cupra – plus McLaren which had qualified by winning the so-called (and as it turned out suitably-named) ‘Crazy Race’.",

    "The explicable non-death of neoliberalism in Chile": "The rejection of the new constitution in a referendum has deep historical traces.\n\nIdeological soulmates: the leader of the military junta, Augusto Pinochet, and the United States secretary of state, Henry Kissinger, in 1976 (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de Chile, CC-BY-2.0)\n\nOn September 4th, Chileans voted against a draft constitution elaborated by elected members of the public, after social unrest in 2019 had forced the then centre-right government to start a constitutional process. While more than 80 per cent had voted in favour of the process in October 2020, two years later the emerging proposal was rejected by almost a two-thirds majority.\n\nTrying to make sense of this puzzling outcome, many analyses have invoked the ‘radicality’ of the text with regard to the right to abortion or indigenous rights, its ‘leftist’ character and the hope for a subsequent ‘do-over’. While all these analyses explain parts of the puzzle, we should focus on the profiles of those who voted for rejection to see the bigger picture.\n\nLogically, the no vote consisted of right-wing voters who did not change opinion from 2020 to 2022, voters who changed their votes in the interim and first-time voters. The first group is analytically not very interesting. The two other types of votes can be explained, respectively, by the roots of the constitutional draft in social movements and the ultimate success of neoliberal ideology in Chile.\n\nSocial movements\n\nThe constitutional process was heavily carried by social movements. This had crucial implications.\n\nFirst, it probably deformed the 2020 vote of approval. That vote was not obligatory, so many who voted in favour of the constituent process in 2020 were individuals who had been mobilised in the unrest of the previous year.\n\nSecondly, many of the members of the Constitutional Assembly were representative of those social movements: feminists, indigenous activists, environmentalists, animal-rights supporters and so on. Their respective agendas found their way into the constitutional draft.\n\nThis gave the proposal a maximalist content, especially with regard to fundamental rights, while neglecting technicalities of political organisation. It included more than 100 rights—many fuzzy and conceptually unclear—ranging from abortion to autonomy for indigenous people and for ‘neuro-different persons’. With many of those rights hotly debated in Chilean society, the proposal provided a raft of pick-and-choose arguments in favour of rejection.\n\nThirdly, the maximalism of the text alienated the centre left. This political sector, which led Chile out of the dictatorship, had been frustrated with the process from the beginning and could not get its candidates into the constitutional assembly. Ricardo Lagos, a former president and still an important centre-left figure, called the draft ‘extremely partisan’.\n\nAt the same time, a new, centre-left social movement called the ‘yellows’ discussed the possibility of rejection while continuing the fight for a new constitution. This effectively gave many who had voted for a constitutional process in 2020 but were unhappy with the draft an unwritten third option in 2022—the ‘do-over’.\n\n\n\nWe need your support\n\nSocial Europe is an independent publisher and we believe in freely available content.

Become a Social Europe Member\n\n\n\nNeoliberal subjection\n\nThis leaves us to explain the rejection of the draft among first-time voters. Those who only voted now because the referendum was obligatory tend to be ‘apolitical’. Their disenchantment would not be with the left or the right, but the state. A common anecdotal narrative was: ‘I come from a poor background. The state has never done anything for me or my family; everything we have, we have because we work very hard. I don’t want the state to take my house away; I don’t want my family to pay taxes on our second home—which we constructed all by ourselves without the help of anyone. And I don’t want to pay for the lazy ones, who don’t do anything and just want social benefits.’\n\nSuch statements are the epitome of subjection to neoliberal doctrine. But then Chile is the country, arguably, in which neoliberalism—the ideology that advocates market fundamentalism and hostility to government for the public good—was born. Already in the 1970s, when ‘Thatcherism’ and later Tony Blair’s ‘third way’ were yet to emerge in Britain, the Latin American country went through a profound change which would determine its fate for decades.\n\nWhen Salvador Allende’s socialist government was overthrown in a military coup backed by the United States in September 1973, Augusto Pinochet, the head of the military junta which then governed Chile until 1990, implemented a neoliberal experiment, supported and advanced by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.\n\nThis political project was long in the making: in the late 1950s, a select group of young economists had gone to the University of Chicago to be trained in orthodox economic policies. These they were to implement—in line with a book called El Ladrillo (‘the brick’), completed weeks before the coup—upon their return.\n\nThe project made the Pinochet regime a forerunner of marketisation and privatisation in Latin America—in healthcare, education, pensions, housing and so on. A deep connection was politically constructed between the establishment of a deregulated market and the authoritarian regime. Paradoxically, this required that a huge bureaucratic apparatus be set up, while the state left welfare to markets. The return to democracy (under the centre left) continued the ‘Chilean way’ and led Chile to became a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 2010.\n\nBroken social contract\n\nWhat happened nearly half a century on is the almost logical continuation of the neoliberal laboratory. When a state has abrogated responsibility for the wellbeing of its citizens and those citizens have internalised the rationale that everyone is the architect of their own future, the social contract breaks down.\n\nThere is no (legitimate) state any more—only an administrative organ. There are no longer citizens. What remain are individuals, wolves among wolves, distrustful of each other, void of feelings of solidarity, void of hope for change.\n\nNeoliberalism has bequeathed what Emile Durkheim called anomie. In such a society devoid of bonds, any attempt at a new social contract—such as this constitutional process—must almost necessarily fail.",

    "Chile’s Millennial President Is a New Kind of Leftist Leader": "Gabriel Boric climbs into the back of the gigantic black SUV waiting outside his house. It’s a cold morning in mid-August—winter in Santiago—and the Chilean President is enveloped in a slightly-too-long gray coat, making him look even younger than his 36 years. As the car rolls through city streets, windows down, pedestrians spot him on his way to work and let out whoops or an affectionate “Presi!” Boric laughs and waves, but then bows his head to nervously scan the front pages of Chile’s newspapers.\n\nThere’s plenty to be nervous about. Since taking office in March, Chile’s youngest-ever leader has been shepherding his country through a moment of historic uncertainty. For decades, Chile was touted as Latin America’s economic success story, with a business-friendly, small-government model creating relative wealth, and political stability, for its 19 million inhabitants. That narrative, however, concealed a long-simmering anger among many ordinary Chileans who, with little government support and expensive private services, struggle to make ends meet. In 2019, anger erupted: a small subway-fare hike set off massive, messy, months-long protests over inequality. Then politicians agreed to replace Chile’s constitution, a dictatorship-era document that underpins its market-driven economic system.\n\nRead More: Read the Transcript of TIME’s Interview With Chile’s President Gabriel Boric\n\nBoric, Chile’s most left-wing leader in half a century, owes his presidency to that upheaval. He was elected in December 2021, promising to lead Chile’s transition into the fairer country demanded by protesters. Five months into his term, it’s crunch time: in a Sept. 4 referendum, Chileans will vote on whether to approve a new constitution that offers sweeping progressive reforms, from a new health system to tighter controls on the mining industry. Supporters, including Boric, say it would make Chile a more democratic country and guarantee equality for marginalized groups; opponents say it would destroy the economy.\n\nAnd so the millennial President finds himself guiding his country through a kind of midlife crisis. “It’s a lot of responsibility, for sure,” Boric says after arriving at his bright, cluttered office in La Moneda, Chile’s presidential palace. “But I wake up every morning excited to keep working on this.”\n\nPhotograph by Luján Agusti for TIME\n\nBoric’s rise is part of a regional shift to the left. After a decade of right-wing domination, leftists have recently won power in five of Latin America’s six largest economies, many on platforms to fight inequality. The largest, Brazil, may join them after October elections.\n\nBut Boric is also something new. An older generation of Latin American leftists, including many still active today, have often made troubling sacrifices—disregarding the environment, democracy, or human rights—in pursuit of a socialist society. Boric says those issues are a core part of his progressive ideology. And although he became famous in Chile in his 20s as a shaggy-haired, radical student leader, today’s Boric is no firebrand—even if some may want him to be. “I think that as a society we should aspire to forms of organization that go beyond capitalism, but it’s not like I can say, ‘Capitalism ends today,’” Boric says, rapping the table with his knuckles, in a brief imitation of more militant figures.\n\nIn person, Boric is warm and quick to laugh, but he’s not relaxed. There’s an intensity buzzing beneath the surface. Over the course of several hours with TIME in La Moneda, he sometimes carries a pen and paper to take notes, listening with a furrowed brow. When he hears criticism, he scrunches up his face as if chewing on a hard math problem. Sometimes he agrees. “You have to keep doubting yourself, and listening to others, or you’ll forget why you’re here,” he says, in a rapid tumble of Chilean Spanish. “Sometimes that means going a little more slowly. I always say: we’re going slowly because we’re going far.”\n\nHow far depends on the Sept. 4 vote. Some Chileans have a growing sense that Boric is letting their country go off the rails: inflation is at a 28-year high, the peso’s value at an all-time low, and violent crime is surging. Boric’s approval rating stands at 38%, and polls now suggest that a majority of voters plan to reject the new constitution—a major blow to his agenda. Whatever happens, the world is watching the young President. “If Boric succeeds, I think it will have tremendous influence beyond Chile’s borders,” says Brian Winter, editor in chief of Americas Quarterly. “It will show that a new kind of leftist leader is possible.”\n\nBoric checks his phone in the corridor of La Moneda presidential palace on Aug. 12. Luján Agusti for TIME\n\nBoric grew up in Punta Arenas, a city of roughly 116,000 in remote southern Patagonia, where the wind blows so fiercely that streets have railings to stop people falling. The eldest of three boys, Boric was more bookish than his brothers, spending hours as a child reading novels brought home from work trips by his father, a Chilean engineer of Croatian descent—hence the pronunciation Bor-itch. Adventure stories were his favorite: tales of charming pirates, and children battling monsters.\n\nBut when he was 12 he came across a fantastical story that didn’t make sense to him. It was 1998, and Augusto Pinochet, the dictator who ruled Chile for 17 years, had just been arrested in London. Boric saw a group of women protesting on the news: they said Pinochet had made their relatives disappear. How could he make someone disappear, Boric wondered, if he wasn’t a magician?\n\nRead more: Chile Is Trying To Shed the Last Remnants of Its Pinochet-Era Dictatorship\n\nHe traded novels for history books to find the answer: in 1973, Chile’s military, led by Pinochet, had violently overthrown the country’s democratically elected Marxist President, Salvador Allende, installing a right-wing regime in his place. Pinochet was aided by the Nixon Administration, which was set on halting the spread of left-wing ideology during the Cold War. By the time Chile’s dictatorship ended in 1990, it had tortured and imprisoned nearly 30,000 opponents and executed 2,279. A further 1,162 victims would never be found.\n\nLearning about Pinochet sparked Boric’s political interest in his teens. He soon discovered other ways in which Chile’s dark past still loomed over its present. Pinochet, with the help of a group of right-wing U.S. economists, had turned his country into a laboratory for neoliberalism—a philosophy that sees free-market capitalism as the solution to all of society’s problems. (Decades later, during his election campaign, Boric would pledge that “if Chile was the cradle of neoliberalism, it’ll also be its grave.”) Pinochet shrank the role of the Chilean state, favoring private enterprise in the provision of education, health care, pensions, and even water.\n\nChile’s system has since lifted millions out of poverty. From 2000 to 2017, the share of Chileans living on less than $5.50 a day fell from 30% to 6.4%, per the World Bank. “That was important. But at the same time we were building a really unequal society,” Boric says. The cost of living has surged, and services exist in a two-tier system, where only those with money can access quality. For instance, 6 in 10 Chilean students pay to attend high school; Boric and his brothers were among them. “When I knew the history, I understood that the privileges that you have in a society as unequal as Chile are sustained by the fact that others don’t have them. It made me really angry.”\n\nHe expressed his anger as many teenagers do: he wore grungy pants and a lumberjack shirt, and grew out “the little facial hair I could,” he says. He got into punk and rock music: Pearl Jam, Metallica, Tool, Chile’s Los Prisioneros, and Argentina’s Charly García. (He still listens to music “almost constantly” and says rock dominates his playlists, despite the reputation he gained as a “Swiftie” when he tweeted support for Taylor Swift, after meeting her Chilean fan base: “They adopted me. I like Red, Folklore, ‘Cardigan.’ But it’s not the style of music I’m most into.”) Over meals, Boric would debate politics with his centrist father, and share “mediocre” poems he had written.\n\nBoric also found ways to act on his feelings. In 2000, at 14, he helped relaunch Punta Arenas’ high school student union, at a time when Chile was experiencing a revitalization of the student movement. A once potent political force, it had been repressed by Pinochet before petering out in the 1990s in a period of relative political apathy. Boric’s generation brought it roaring back. At 20, while studying law at the University of Chile in Santiago, he joined months of marches and building occupations by school and college students, demanding a fairer education system.\n\nBoric in 2012 with student leaders, including future official spokesperson Camila Vallejo, right. Fernando Lavoz—NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\nBoric became well known in 2011, when he was 25. That year, during another mass mobilization of hundreds of thousands of students, he was elected leader of Chile’s national federation of student unions. After his victory, an excited Boric told reporters that young people were tired of “the government and the political class, who want to commercialize all aspects of our lives.” A movement was coming, he said, “which would transform not only education, but the entire country.”\n\nThat movement had a few victories over the next few years. In 2013, four prominent figures from the student movement, including Boric, won seats in Congress, which was then made up of 158 legislators. But change was frustratingly slow, even under center-left President Michelle Bachelet (2014 to 2018). That’s partly because of Chile’s rigid constitution, written under Pinochet in 1980. Though it doesn’t explicitly endorse neoliberalism, it acts as a kind of ideological straitjacket by making many legislative changes dependent on approval by a constitutional court and a large majority in Congress. Those are hard to come by, thanks to an electoral system designed to produce stalemates. In 1979, the constitution’s writer said he aimed to “restrain whoever is governing” so that “if our adversaries get into power, they’ll be forced to take actions not so different to the ones we’d want.”\n\nFor a long time it seemed nothing could blast through that stagnation. Then, from October to December of 2019, roughly 3 million Chileans—some 16% of the population—took to the streets, led by students and other young people. The protests were sometimes violent; city centers were smashed up and set alight, and police responded brutally. Around 30 people died and hundreds were imprisoned by the government of right-wing President Sebastián Piñera. The period is now known as the social explosion.\n\nRead More: I Was Shot and Lost My Sight for Protesting Inequality in Chile. We Need to Keep Demanding Justice\n\nBoric, then in his second term as a Congressman, joined some of the protests, sharing many of the organizers’ concerns. But he was no longer the activist of his 20s. “We couldn’t just be agitators,” he says. “We had to offer an alternative, something to channel the conflict in some direction.”\n\nThat thinking led Boric, in November 2019, to champion an agreement with Piñera and other politicians to hold a referendum on whether or not to launch a project to replace the Pinochet-era constitution. It was controversial: left-wing politicians largely rejected the deal, fearing a constitutional process led by Piñera, a 72-year-old billionaire, would be designed to prevent real change, and represent a betrayal of the imprisoned protesters. In December 2019, a group of young protesters attacked Boric, emptying beer cans over his head while he sat on a park bench in Santiago. “You sold us out,” they shouted. In a video of the incident, Boric remains still. “I was reflecting in that moment,” he recalls. “They were accusing me of something that I didn’t believe I had done. And I still don’t. But it was hard, and it wasn’t the only time.”\n\nFor many, though, Boric’s willingness to work with political rivals legitimized him as a viable leader. Chile held that first referendum in October 2020, with 78% of voters opting to replace the constitution. Then the time came to replace Piñera as well, at scheduled 2021 presidential elections. In a surprise result in July 2021, a left-wing electoral coalition chose Boric as its candidate, over a Communist Party politician who had opposed the deal. In December, at the second round of the presidential election, Boric won 56% of the vote—a lead of 12 percentage points over José Antonio Kast, a far-right lawmaker with ties to the Pinochet regime.\n\nStephania Escobar, a handicraft seller at a central Santiago market in her 50s, was among those who voted for Boric. “It’s a big collective task we have on our hands. But he’s like a bridge,” she says, “a bridge to the changes we want to make.”\n\nWhen asked to describe their new President, many Chileans speaking to TIME use the word cercano (close) because Boric’s political style is less formal than most. He talks openly, for example, about his struggles with obsessive-compulsive disorder, which led him to check into a psychiatric clinic in 2018, and which still manifests in small gestures he makes at public events. He speaks candidly with TIME about gaining weight during his campaign, prompting him to start boxing in the mornings before work.\n\nRead More: Chile’s Protest Reflect Our Unequal Times\n\nBoric also lives physically closer to ordinary Chileans. The country has no official presidential residence, and previous leaders, largely elected in their 60s and 70s, have favored posh neighborhoods to the north of Santiago. After his election, Boric and his partner Irina Karamanos—a 32-year-old feminist activist he began dating in 2019—moved into a modest house in Yungay, a central neighborhood. Their neighbors are families and students living in subdivided, run-down buildings, and crime rates are high. The President’s team grumbles that he insists on walking to buy bread nearby, causing a minor security headache. Boric has also tried to make his office more approachable. He reopened a public square outside La Moneda that was previously cordoned off, and speaks with crowds gathered there most days.\n\nSome of it can feel a little contrived. But Tomás Boric, 29, the President’s youngest brother, says the down-to-earth image reflects what he saw growing up. “Most people spoke to me like a kid, but Gabriel never did,” he says. “He listened to me. He gave me his time. He does that for everyone.”\n\nBoric celebrates his victory with supporters on election night on Dec. 19. Felipe Figueroa—SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images\n\nBoric now finds himself at the helm of a bold social experiment. For decades, Latin America’s vast gap between rich and poor—one of the largest in the world—has stunted economies and fostered disruption: rapid swings from right to left, guerrilla wars, strongmen, coups, and corruption. In Chile, many hope that rewriting the constitution could address inequality in a uniquely democratic way—and perhaps serve as an example for other nations. “I feel so lucky to have been born at this time,” says Ericka Ñanco. Elected to Congress in November at age 29 to represent the southern Araucanía region, she is one of the youngest members of Boric’s coalition. “In other eras, the dreams of young people were crushed. Now we have the opportunity to change things.”\n\nThe new constitution was drafted by an assembly of 155 representatives, chosen at a special election in May 2021: 77 are women, and 17 are from Chile’s Indigenous communities, proportional to their 13% share of the population. Proponents of the new constitution say it imagines a better country, one that balances economic development with workers’ rights, environmental protections, and gender equality. It particularly emphasizes the rights of marginalized groups, including the autonomy of the Indigenous peoples, who were not even recognized in Pinochet’s constitution, over their own cultures, land, and institutions. The document calls for drastic changes to Chile’s political structures, as well as new national health care and education systems (private operators would remain, but with more oversight). In August, an international group of prominent progressive economists said the draft “prepares Chile for a new century of equitable growth.”\n\nNot everyone is sure of that outcome. Winter of Americas Quarterly says “the hope is that Chile is able to achieve developed world status in the next 10 or 20 years,” if it can reduce inequality, a major barrier to development. “I think that’s very much on the table. But the fear is that Chile will lose what made it an imperfect success story over the last 30 years.” That is, it could trade its stable market-driven economy for the stagnant, inflation-prone chaos of its neighbor Argentina, hurting poor as well as rich Chileans.\n\nRead More: Gabriel Boric: The Leftist Millennial Who Could Lead One of Latin America’s Wealthiest and Most Unequal Countries\n\nFor Kenneth Bunker, a Chilean pollster, the new constitution has too many flaws to accept. He sees it as a mishmash of the 155 assembly members’ diverse priorities. “It over-regulates so much that there will be a lot of fights about enacting it.” There are also specific concerns: a plan to abolish the Senate, for example, would leave many pieces of legislation subject to only one chamber’s approval, undermining Chile’s consensus-based political culture. Conservatives are also worried about the breadth of proposed spending: the Economist dubbed the document “a fiscally irresponsible left-wing wish list.” Some in Chile argue the document does not accurately reflect the wishes of the general population because turnout for the elections for the constitutional assembly was only 43%. More than half of the representatives chosen came from left or center-left blocs. Many others were progressive-leaning independents, while less than a third came from the right, according to Chilean media.\n\nBoric accepts that some parts of the text need more clarity before they become the law of the land. “There are always things that could be improved, and we’re having that debate,” he says. “But it’s a big step forward for Chile.” He is urging voters to approve it, promising Congress will reform the document after it passes.\n\nIt’s unclear if that will happen. Alongside legitimate debate, opponents of the new constitution have mounted a powerful misinformation campaign on social media and in paper leaflets. Among the false claims circulating are that the draft would abolish Chile’s police force, ban the sale of bottled water, allow abortion at any stage of pregnancy, and outlaw private property. Given the actual text runs to 170 pages of academic language, many voters are relying on others to interpret it for them. The most ardent opponents claim that adopting it would be Chile’s first step toward becoming the new Venezuela—whose socialist economy has imploded over the past decade—and that Boric is enthusiastically leading them down that path.\n\nIt may be true that Chile’s Communist Party makes up a fifth of Boric’s coalition in the lower house of Congress. But the President himself belongs to the more center-left Social Convergence Party, and his aspirations lie closer to European-style social democracy. “I don’t see a state controlling everything like in the socialisms of the 20th century, which failed,” he says. “We have to take ownership of that failure.”\n\nDeeply marked by the memory of the Pinochet regime, Boric is outspoken about violations of democracy and human rights—whether they come from the right or left. He has criticized far-left leaders in Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua who have embraced authoritarianism—a break from older leftists in the region, who tend to keep quiet about abuses on their own side. That attitude frustrates Boric, he says with a sigh. “I can’t get outraged when rights are violated in Palestine but not in Nicaragua, because when the defense of human rights is partial, it loses legitimacy. In Chile, we’re going to do things differently.”\n\nThe president peeks out from the balcony of the presidential house, Palacio de la Moneda, Aug. 12—the same one he used for his speech on the day of his inauguration as president. Luján Agusti for TIME\n\nWalking around the extravagantly upholstered furniture and high-ceilinged corridors of La Moneda, a museum-like colonial building where Presidents have worked since the 1800s, Boric can look a little out of place. He could be a hipster barista, with his trendy beard and tattoos peeking out of his shirt, or maybe a young -professor— a studious type who reels off suggested reading lists on request.\n\nMany Chileans seem happy to have a young President. But Boric is also battling a perception that he and his team, which includes several former student activists, are inexperienced. Some episodes feel like minor misfires: in rethinking the role of First Lady, Boric’s girlfriend briefly renamed her office “Irina Karamanos’ Cabinet,” leading to claims that she was personalizing the institution. Some feel ridiculous: right-wing media attacked Boric for leaving his fly down at an official meeting. (“Now I’m always worried when I’m getting out of the car,” he says.)\n\nBut Boric has also made some serious U-turns. In April, bowing to pressure from his left, he proposed allowing Chileans to withdraw money from their pension pots, despite having expressed fears that such moves worsen inflation. (The plan was rejected by Congress.) “He seems to draw a line in the sand. And then something happens and he has to follow others back over it,” says Bunker.\n\nThe most serious stumble so far has been on security. As a Congressman, Boric condemned Piñera’s decision to deploy the military to Araucanía, where small separatist groups from the Indigenous Mapuche community are engaged in a violent conflict with forestry companies. Security forces have killed several Mapuche people in high-profile cases. But in April, Boric remilitarized the region’s roads. The apparent about-face left the impression that Boric’s team doesn’t know what it’s doing, according to Salvador Millaleo, a Mapuche lawyer. “They did not prepare enough,” he says. “They underestimated both the importance and complexity of this issue.”\n\nBoric says his government “may have been a bit headstrong” in its initial approach to the conflict. “I am still convinced that the state of emergency is not the solution,” he says. But, he adds, “I am the President of all Chileans. So sometimes I have to do things I don’t like.” He pauses and, speaking slowly, disagrees that his U-turns indicate a failure of leadership. “Changing your position isn’t a weakness, as long as it’s coherent with your principles. I’m more concerned about people who can never change their mind.”\n\nBoric is hoping Chileans have not changed their minds about rewriting the constitution, though. If voters approve the new draft on Sept. 4, the national transformation Boric wants will begin in earnest: Congress will embark on a years-long project to draft new legislation. If they reject it, as polls suggest they will, Boric says the huge mandate from the October 2020 referendum will still apply: Chile would start again from scratch, holding elections for a fresh constitutional assembly to write a new draft. If that happens, parts of his agenda may be left in limbo.\n\nBut Boric says there’s still a lot he can do for Chile in the meantime. His government has pushed through a 17% minimum wage hike, and recently announced a bill to cut the workweek from 45 to 40 hours. In July, they unveiled a major tax reform to raise levies on high earners, capital gains, and mining companies. And after Congress approved a climate law in March, Boric’s Environment Minister, a climate scientist, has begun drawing up Chile’s plan to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\nRead more: An Indigenous Rights Leader Is Trying to Rewrite Chile’s Constitution to Put its Ecosystems First\n\nBoric also has wide discretion over foreign policy. He says he wants to refocus regional relationships away from 20th century ideological alliances, toward cooperation on climate action. A key aim is to band Latin America together “under one voice” to pressure richer countries to cut their emissions faster. That could include “making the exports of raw materials or clean energy conditional on changes in consumption behavior in more developed countries,” he says. (Chile holds major reserves of copper and lithium, essential for renewable technologies like electric cars.) He wants to attend October’s U.N. climate conference in Egypt to begin those discussions, he says. “Everyone has a responsibility, but some are more responsible than others. And we have to demand they meet theirs.”\n\nWhen Boric was preparing for his presidential portrait in the run-up to his inauguration in March, he and his team looked at those of all his predecessors. Each one seems to fit their era: 19th century colonial liberators in their military uniforms; early 20th century land barons in refined bow ties. Then Allende in 1970, slouching in a chair: unaware of what would happen to his government three years later. Next, Pinochet, another military man, severe and confident of his hold over Chile. Finally, the slick-suited statesmen—and woman—of the neoliberal era.\n\nBoric was sure of one thing: he wouldn’t wear a tie. He had long eschewed them, causing a minor sensation in the Chilean press. The dress code for leaders has changed over the centuries, he says, from “French kings in high heels and stockings” to “Barack Obama sitting on top of his desk.” He’s pretty confident that in 20 years, more Presidents will have nixed the tie. “I’m part of a transition here.”\n\nHe ended up with a photo in which he looks a little stiff, standing in front of the Pacific Ocean. It’s impossible to know what teleological meanings people will draw from it in a few decades. Is this the President defeated by a referendum a few months into his term? The one who blew up Chile’s economy and lost control of its security? Or the one who transformed his country and created a new model for Latin America’s left? On this, Boric is less willing to make predictions. “You can’t worry about how history will unfold,” he says. “If you do, you’ll get dizzy.”\n\n— With reporting by Solcyre Burga and Anisha Kohli/New York\n\nWrite to Ciara Nugent at ciara.nugent@time.com.",

[+] Escondida is the biggest in the world. (Photo by Oliver Llaneza Hesse/Construction Photography/Avalon/Getty Images) Getty Images\n\nChile is a nation that is incredibly rich in natural resources. In particular, it is rich in two minerals that are most needed by renewable energy and electric vehicles: Copper and lithium.\n\nChile has long been the world’s largest producer and exporter of copper, the super-conductive metal that is integral to pretty much every device, gadget, appliance and means of transportation that creates, uses or moves electricity. Other than oil, copper is perhaps the single most important mineral resource that enables our modern way of life. In 2021, Chile produced 2-1/2 times as much copper as Peru, the second leading global producer.\n\nAlong with Bolivia and Argentina, Chile is also one of three South American nations whose borders intersect in the highly-elevated salt flats basins known as “the lithium triangle,” the world’s largest resource of brine-based lithium. Like copper, lithium is ubiquitous in our lives, although few humans are actually aware of its presence.\n\nA general view of Laguna Colorada located in the Eduardo Abaroa Andean National Fauna Reserve in the ... [+] highlands of San Luis, near the border with Chile, in the Uyuni salt flats, Bolivia on October 7, 2009. The Uyuni salt flats are estimated to contain 10 billion tons of salt - of which 25,000 tons are extracted every year - as well as 100 million tons of lithium, making it one of the largest global reserves of this mineral, according to state officials at the Bolivian Mining Corporation (COMIBOL). The salt flats are a major tourist attraction in Bolivia, with around 60 thousand tourists visiting them every year, where one can find various types of flamingos, giant cacti, geysers, hot springs, volcanoes and colorful ponds. AFP PHOTO/Martin Bernetti - MORE IN IMAGE FORUM (Photo credit should read MARTIN BERNETTI/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images\n\nMost prominently, lithium is used in the lithium-ion batteries we all use in our daily lives, and which are the battery of choice for electric vehicles, and currently dominant in the realm of providing storage backup for wind and solar power.\n\nThis energy transition literally cannot happen without cheap and plentiful supplies of these two critical minerals. As governments of the west attempt to subsidize wind, solar and EVs into critical mass, demand for these two minerals is projected to explode in the coming decades. Copper demand is expected to at least double by 2035, according to an S&P Global study, while the International Energy Agency projects lithium demand to escalate by an almost unimaginable 4,000% by 2040.\n\nThus, in a very significant way, Chile’s energy future is everyone’s energy future.\n\nBut that energy future is about to become quite murky as Chileans prepare to approve a new national constitution on September 4. The draft document is 178 pages long - 7 times the length of the U.S. constitution - and contains 11 chapters and 388 articles. It is a radical shift from Chile’s existing constitution, one so extreme that it has been described by The Economist as “a “fiscally irresponsible left-wing wish list.”\n\nOf particular interest in the draft constitution where mining for copper and extraction of lithium are concerned is Article 145, which reads as follows:\n\nMineral Statute\n\nArticle 145.\n\n1. The State has absolute, exclusive, inalienable and imprescriptible dominion over all mines and mineral substances, metallic, non-metallic, and deposits of fossil substances and hydrocarbons existing in the national territory, with the exception of surface clays, without prejudice to the ownership of the land on which they are located.\n\n2. The exploration, exploitation and use of these substances shall be subject to a regulation that considers their finite, non-renewable nature, intergenerational public interest and environmental protection.\n\nWhile the constitutional convention that drafted the document debated inclusion of an overt nationalization of the country’s mineral extraction industries, it ultimately rejected the proposal. But some observers are concerned that this mineral statute, along with other provisions in the draft, are designed to facilitate the implementation of a de facto nationalization led by current President Gabriel Boric, who has advocated for such a move.\n\nWhile current Chilean law provides for all subsurface minerals to be owned by the government, the mining and extraction of these mineral resources are conducted under concessions made during the presidency of Augusto Pinochet to giant mining companies like Rio Tinto and BHP, along with state-owned mining company CODELCO. A full nationalization of the industry would almost certainly result in disruptions that would inhibit the ability of Chile to grow its mineral production to meet the needs of the energy transition.\n\nRecent polling data indicates Sunday’s referendum vote is likely to fail. But as we have seen in the U.S., the U.K. and elsewhere in recent years, polling data has a disturbing tendency to be wrong.\n\nLike it or not, Chile’s energy future is everyone’s energy future. Sunday’s vote is a key event to the future progression of this energy transition.",

    "Venezuelan Migrants and Refugees Defy Deadly Desert Conditions on Their Journey to Chile - Chile": "Colchane, 29 August 2022 – Jhonny, 26, along with his wife, Cribsel, 19 and six months pregnant, sit with their two children at a migrant reception centre. Sunburned and gasping for breath, the 3,700-meter-high altitude and freezing climatic conditions have noticeably taken their toll on this young family of four.\n\nThe family trekked for five hours from Bolivia to Chile. Since first leaving Venezuela on foot two months and some 5,000-odd kilometers ago, they have gone through five border crossings. \"It was the first time we experienced cold weather. This part has been the toughest,\" Jhonny says with split lips and cracked feet. \"We were not prepared with winter coats or blankets.\"\n\nThe construction worker lost his job in Venezuela and simply covering basic necessities became impossible for the family of four. They decided to leave their hometown of Aragua with just USD 450 and a backpack of essentials to venture upon the long walk across the Andean highlands, first crossing into Colombia, and later Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia, sleeping on the streets throughout most of their journey.\n\nTheir story is far from an isolated case. Often in small groups, exhausted people are on the move along one of the most extensive migration routes in the world, mainly embarking on foot with periodic intervals by bus, taxi and other forms of transport. For Venezuelans travelling to Chile, the last hurdle is the grueling Atacama Desert, the driest and highest plateau in the world at nearly 4,000 meters above sea level and with temperatures dropping below minus 10 degrees Celsius.\n\nMany migrants and refugees travel irregularly across these routes, confronting dangers such as robbery and the risk of sexual exploitation and abuse by criminal groups. According to Medical Legal Services, seven people have died since the beginning of 2022, either due to exposure to extreme conditions or due to health complications stemming from pre-existing medical conditions exacerbated by the inhospitable terrain of the Atacama Desert.\n\nNear the Chilean town of Colchane, and upon crossing the shared border with Bolivia at dawn, Jhonny’s family, alongside other migrants, are relieved to find much-needed life-saving humanitarian assistance. They arrive hungry, and suffering from hypothermia, dehydration, and altitude sickness.\n\nAs of July 2022, there were approximately 127,000 migrants who entered Chile through irregular crossing, according to estimates by Chilean authorities. Many enter Chile every day through Colchane, a small village of less than 500 residents, of whom 85 per cent are indigenous. Many are often driven by the desire to reunify with their family members and to contribute to host communities.\n\n“Our goal is to work and do something constructive. I want people to think of me as a Venezuelan who has something positive to give. This will help change the perception they have about us,” Jhonny adds.\n\nExtreme winter conditions increase hardship\n\nAfter several trying months since first arriving in Chile, Francisco and his family have had to grapple with low-temperature conditions living on the streets of the City of Iquique, a drastic difference from the tropical conditions in their hometown. The family of five now finds refuge at a temporary shelter financed and managed by the International Organization for Migration (IOM).\n\n“We were sleeping under a blanket, embracing each other for warmth, that was moreover covered in ice. We had to use our bags as pillows to prevent robbery during the night.”\n\nMaria, 18, has finally achieved a degree of stability after giving birth to a healthy baby boy in Chile. She now has a place to live in Iquique and is among hundreds receiving humanitarian assistance from IOM in the form of cash vouchers, hundreds of which have been distributed to vulnerable families to provide them with means to buy food, hygiene products, and warm clothing.\n\nAcross Chile, IOM has stepped up its presence and the delivery of humanitarian assistance to respond to the direct needs of migrants and refugees arriving to the country.\n\n“We are distributing food, water, medical care, shelter and basic relief items such as blankets and winter clothes provided by NGOs,” said Susan Saavedra, IOM Project Assistant in Colchane. Furthermore, IOM has deployed a medical team to carry out first-aid care, an intervention that benefits migrants and host communities.\n\nSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, IOM in Chile has had field staff stationed in Colchane to allow for the rapid coordination and implementation of humanitarian assistance.\n\nIn coordination with authorities and civil society organizations, IOM has put in place the necessary infrastructure to temporarily house the migrant population in transit, and attend to their pressing humanitarian needs. Since 2014, more than 6,8 million Venezuelans have left their country; around 450,000 live in Chile.\n\nSeeking a lifeline\n\nJaneth Perez, 36, never thought she would one day have to leave her beloved home. Back in her native Venezuela, she was a Math and Physics high school teacher, but the financial situation forced her to leave her life and profession behind. She began the long road to Chile, alone, and with the hopes of finding a new beginning.\n\nFollowing an arduous 11-day journey by bus, she recently arrived in Chile and is determined to get to the port city of Valparaiso, approximately 2,000 kilometers south of the Bolivian-Chilean border, in order to reunite with her sister and start a new life working at a supermarket.\n\n“With this new job I will be able to provide for my 15-year-old son and mother, whom I left behind in my hometown of Barinas. I am so grateful for this new opportunity and a new beginning,” she said, reaching Chile exhausted after a final ten-hour passage by foot.\n\nDespite all these challenges, Janeth and many others are grateful for the opportunity to be able to work and support their families, both in Chile and back home in Venezuela. She dreams of regularizing her status, validating her university diploma and working as a teacher, her passion.\n\n“The future I imagine is one where I can once again teach in order to earn enough money to buy a house and go back home with my son and mother to live together in peace.”\n\nThis story was written by Gema Cortés, IOM Media and Communications Unit, Office of the Special Envoy for the Regional Response to the Venezuelan Situation.",
    "Argentina and Chile Deter Costly Fruit Fly Outbreaks with Help of Nuclear Technology": "In 2019, twenty-four years after Chile declared itself Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly) free, the country experienced one of its largest outbreaks — costing the economy approximately US$ 5 million. Worried about future outbreaks, which are caused by the movement of people and fruit from countries where the medfly is present, in 2020 Chile’s Agricultural and Livestock Service (SAG), in collaboration with Argentina’s National Food Safety and Quality Service (SENASA), the IAEA and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), decided to apply the sterile insect technique (SIT) as a preventive measure.\n\nIn the north of the country, at Arica, Chile is producing sterile flies to be released over areas at risk of outbreaks in the Metropolitan Region of Santiago. These locally produced sterile flies are complemented with imported medflies from a facility in Argentina. By mating with the wild female population, the sterile insects reduce the number of offspring, resulting in rapid gradual elimination. When used as preventive measures, they eliminate emerging population as soon as they arise.\n\n“By using the SIT for prevention, we’ve successfully reduced the number of outbreaks and reduced the use of environmentally harmful conventional methods such as chemical applications by 60 per cent,” said Jocelyn Elena Yevenes Flores, Head of the Fruit Flies Sub-department at SAG.\n\nIn Argentina, SIT has been applied as a preventive strategy since 2005. Today, the preventive releases of sterile flies in the country is done over 34,700 hectares of land, including in fruit fly pest free areas of Mendoza and Patagonia. Between 1,500 to 4,500 sterile males are released per hectare two to three times per week. These flies are mass-reared and sterilized at the Santa Rosa facility of the Agricultural Health and Quality Institute (ISCAMEN)’s located in Mendoza.\n\nThe facility is the largest Mediterranean fruit fly mass rearing facility in South America, with a production capacity of 700 million sterile male flies per week. Moreover, a Fly Emergence and Release Facility, located in south of the Mendoza Province, has a capacity to process 500 million sterile flies per week — a strategic link in supplying sterile flies needed in Mendoza and Patagonia.",

    "Urfa Chile Makes Everything Better, Including This Chocolate Bar": "This is Highly Recommend, a column dedicated to what people in the food industry are obsessed with eating, drinking, and buying right now.\n\nDried chiles were a staple in my household, and my mother always kept three kinds in our pantry: pul biber (flaked chile), kırmızı toz biber (powdered chile), and Urfa biber. The latter, also known as Urfa chile, is my absolute favorite of the three. It’s a souvenir I bring back in bulk whenever I visit my family in Turkey, and I use it on almost everything: Turkish-style poached eggs, fresh salads and mezze, and even leftover pizza. Grown in the hills surrounding Urfa in southeastern Turkey, it’s a purplish-black spice that packs a smoky kick and subtle sweetness, adding serious depth and nuance to any dish or snack—including my favorite Spring & Mulberry chocolate bar.\n\nThere are a lot of fancy chocolates on the market, but Spring & Mulberry is the one I always keep stocked in my snack cabinet. Made with 72% cacao and sweetened only with dates, Spring & Mulberry’s chocolate bars comes in five flavors: Pure Dark Chocolate; Mixed Berry; Medjool Date, Pecan, and Himalayan Salt; Lavender, Bee Pollen, and Rose Petal; and—my go-to—Mango, Urfa Chili, Black Lime.\n\nEach chocolate bar is visually striking, with flecks of smoky Urfa chili flakes from Spicewalla and succulent mango slices pressed into the bar like mosaic tiles. The first time I picked one up at dinner party shop Big Night in Brooklyn, I thought, “Maybe it’ll taste like chocolate-covered dried mangoes.” But when I snapped a piece off and popped it into my mouth, it summoned a bewitching savory sweetness followed by a delightful kick, unlocking a core memory. That one bite transported me right back to my mother's kitchen, where I could always smell the spice in the air.\n\nThanks to the generous amount of dried fruit, the chocolate bar itself is pretty hefty. While I have eaten a whole bar in a single sitting, two squares are usually more than enough to satisfy if I’m in need of a chocolate pick-me-up. The combination of the chocolate and mango tastes heavenly, but it’s the Urfa chili flakes that seal the deal for me. With each bite, I’m reminded of my summers in Turkey—even if I’m just sitting on the couch with my partner in Newark.",
    "US Secretary of State to visit Chile in early October and meet with president Boric": "US Secretary of State to visit Chile in early October and meet with president Boric\n\n22nd Thursday, September 2022 - 10:05 UTC Full article\n\nThe purpose is to continue working on the agenda addressed last June by presidents, Gabriel Boric and Joe Biden.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken will be visiting Chile on 4/5 October as part of a tour of South American Pacific countries including Peru and Colombia, according to Chilean foreign ministry sources. The purpose is to continue working on the agenda addressed last June by presidents, Gabriel Boric and Joe Biden.\n\nThe issues to be addressed are under consideration, but anyhow a meeting of Blinken with president Boric is scheduled to continue with issues that were on the table during the June Biden/Boric summit in Los Angeles, California.\n\nFour are the main areas from an Inter-American perspective to be addressed, economic issues, of particular significance for the Chilean president; issues related to the migratory situation, with the objective of reaching some kind or regional accord; likewise transition towards clean, green energies, and corruption.\n\nHowever Blinken visit will be followed by another in November, of a high level technical delegation, to deal with bilateral issues, something which has not taken place in the last two years, pointed out Chilean foreign ministry sources.\n\nThe visit of the head of US diplomacy has been facilitated by the Chilean ambassador in Washington, Juan Gabriel Valdes, an expert in US affairs and who is expected in Santiago to make the arrangements for Blinken's visit",
    "Qatar aim to bounce back against Chile": "By Sports Reporter/ Doha\n\n• After today’s match, Sanchez and his men will return home for a brief period\n\nAfter a disappointing loss to Canada last week, Qatar will be hoping to put up a better show when they take on Chile in the international friendly in Vienna today.\n\nFelix Sanchez’s men, who are camping in Europe for the last four months as they prepare for their World debut at home, were outplayed by fellow World Cup qualifiers Canada last Friday.\n\nToday, the Maroons will run into a much tougher opponent Chile at 8pm at the Viola Park in Vienna. This will be the final opportunity for Sanchez to finalise his 26-member squad for the World Cup, and by the looks of it the Spaniard has a lot more to worry about.\n\nAgainst Canada, Qatar employed a deep defensive line and offered little in attack as they struggled to impose themselves, conceding both goals within the opening 13 minutes. Lack of intense match practice was apparent on Qatar players’ performance as they have sat out of Qatar Stars league matches back home.\n\nThe squad remains too light with lack of quality on the bench making it impossible for Sanchez to try new players. On Friday, the defence was disorganised from the opening minute as Qatar’s weakness in defending crosses in the box was laid bare as it did during the European qualifiers earlier this year.\n\nHaving spent tens of billions of dollars preparing for the first World Cup in an Arab nation, Qatar is desperate to see the national side get past the first round where they are grouped with Netherlands, Senegal and Ecuador.\n\nBefore the match against Canada, the Maroons have played few behind-the-door friendly matches against clubs and second string national teams as their preparations have been kept a well-guarded secret. After their match against Chile, Sanchez and his men briefly return home. The players will be given three days’ rest before they will hold an open training session in front of fans and media for five days at the Jassim Bin Hamad Stadium. Qatar then will return to isolation in Spain for more training.\n\nToday, Qatar will get a sterner test against Chile with the South Americans still reeling from the shock of missing out on World Cup qualification. Chile will miss a second straight tournament after enduring a torrid qualification campaign, where La Roja finished five points adrift of the playoff place and seven points off automatic qualification.\n\nChile, who went down to Morocco on Friday, are looking to get out of the rut having gone winless in their last six games and also failing to find the net in each one of those matches. Chile – who are 13 places above Qatar in the world rankings – have quality players all over the pitch with the likes of Alexis Sanchez, Arturo Vidal and Gary Medel in their line-up.\n\nMarcelino Nunez is in contention to come into the midfield, while Francisco Serralta and Gabriel Suazo may also be brought into the starting lineup. Ben Brereton Diaz is expected to keep his place in the frontline, with the forward looking to add to the four goals that he has scored at international level.\n\nDefender Daniel Gutierrez said Chile was looking to put their poor performances behind. “This match is extremely important. It will help us improve ourselves mentally and physically. It will be an intense duel tomorrow. We must become strong and keep up the pace,” Gutierrez said.\n\nAfter the defeat against Morocco, Alexis Sanchez was a disappointed man. “We weren’t moving the ball fairly to our midfielders. We have to put in better performance against Qatar. It is a challenge for everyone,” he said.\n\n\n\nQatar’s players at a training session in Vienna yesterday.",
    "Even Chile’s drought-hit communities rejected ‘ecological’ constitution": "Vilches is a spokesperson for Modatima, where she has been involved for more than 10 years. Once her work with the Constitutional Convention was over, she spent two months campaigning throughout the region, but it wasn’t enough.\n\nShe welcomes us into her house after dark, and a large yellow moon overlooks the hill. She is still drafting the statements she was asked to make by some newspapers. “The sad thing is that now that Reject has won, they say that there is no water problem,” Vilches laments. “This is the idea they are installing, that water ownership is not a problem. But it is.” It is unavoidable in the landscape of Petorca, where the intense green of the avocado crops ends in sharp, straight lines, flanked by earthy hills, merely dotted with bushes.\n\nSara Larraín, director of the NGO Chile Sustentable, agrees. “A contingent [of the electorate] that had not been participating in politics, that traditionally does not participate and is not interested in political participation, took part. It is a section that is much more sensitive to media campaign messages, and which also had little chance of knowing the content,” she says.\n\nMany who were disconnected throughout the process were forced to vote on a constitution they did not know or to which they did not feel politically connected\n\nAccording to an analysis by Plataforma Telar, disinformation accompanied the constitutional rewrite from the beginning of the process, although the volume of false information, especially on social networks, increased considerably in the final leg of the campaign.\n\n“When Petorca rejects the water solution in the constitution, or the communities with the largest indigenous population reject the recovery of land for indigenous peoples, it reveals that there is a lack of information, due to a disinformation campaign,” says Sara Larraín.\n\nThe environmental sphere, in Chile and abroad, showed great support for the “ecological” constitution, but it was rejected in the territories where it matters most. As in Petorca, in the towns of Quintero, Puchuncaví, Coronel and Tocopilla – other areas of concerted socio-environmental conflicts in Chile – the Reject option prevailed by a large majority.\n\n“These are territories that associated environmental issues with the Constitutional Convention. The issue is that the constitutional process addressed many other issues beyond the environment, and this perhaps touched another nerve and other sensibilities that begin to explain the result,” says Felipe Irarrázaval, a researcher at the Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies (COES) in Santiago.\n\nThere were other issues that weighed on the campaign, says Irarrázaval, such as housing – and associated fears generated – and the political system. “The lesson for the environmental world,” he says, “is that they have to have an agenda for these groups that will eventually vote in a possible new plebiscite. Broad political agendas and greater sensitivity.”\n\nThe next steps\n\nWith the text of the Constitutional Convention rejected, the 1980 Constitution remains in force – a legacy of Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship that enshrines water as a tradable commodity in the market. Gabriel Boric’s government is pushing to begin the process anew, with a new convention and another plebiscite. The decision, however, rests in the hands of the country’s congress.\n\nWhether or not this new process is realised, in Petorca, the struggle for the right to water will continue, and is likely to remain the primary issue for its inhabitants.\n\nThis is the warning of Veronica Vilches, leader of the Rural Drinking Water Committee of San José de Cabildo. She is a water defender who has denounced the theft of water by large agricultural companies, in collusion with local and national politicians.\n\n“They have threatened me, they have burned my car, the police have come to my house to say that I was stealing water for my community and Amnesty International had to intervene, but there is no need to panic,” explains Veronica, who a few months ago received a third death threat. “We have to continue on this path, so that the province of Petorca will one day have water with the three Cs: calidad, cantidad y continuidad.”"
