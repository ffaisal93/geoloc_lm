    "Portugal's mysterious 'birthing stones'": "The wind whipped across my face as I stood on the edge of a vast plateau in remote northern Portugal. Lavender-blue haze stretched across the horizon, and I could just make out the outline of a steep waterfall as it cascaded down the mountain below. Delicate yellow flowers created swathes of colour in the otherwise murky landscape. Looking down on the mountains spread out before me like an undulating carpet, I felt as if I was standing at the edge of the world, and I could see why these were called the Montanhas Mágicas (Magic Mountains).\n\nI was in the Arouca Unesco Global Geopark, an open-air geological museum that has long been an attraction for the scientific community due to the sheer number of geological marvels it contains: 41 separate geosites in total. These include some of the world's biggest trilobite fossils – arthropods that lived more than 500 million years ago – as well as geological fault lines and otherworldly rock formations sculpted by water over millions of years.\n\nBut I had not come to see any of these – admittedly interesting – natural exhibits. I had come for something even more fascinating: one of the world's most baffling geological phenomena.\n\nPulling myself away from the mountain view, I continued towards my destination: the tiny village of Castanheira. Nestled into the side of the Freita Mountain (one of the Magic Mountains located within the geopark), the village is home to the Pedras Parideiras, or \"Birthing Stones\" in English – 300-million-year-old rocks that seem to \"give birth\" to smaller \"baby\" stones. They are unlike any other rock on the planet.",

(AP Photo/Luca Bruno, File)\n\nMADRID (AP) — Coach Luis Enrique tried to stay optimistic about Spain’s chances of advancing in the Nations League following a disappointing home loss to Switzerland.\n\nAfter all, La Roja can still secure a spot in the finals with a win in Portugal on Tuesday.\n\n“We see it as a final,” Luis Enrique said Monday, two days after the 2-1 loss to Switzerland dropped Spain from first to second in Group A2 ahead of the decisive match in Braga. “It’s positive to arrive in the last round with a possibility to win the group.”\n\nBut beating Portugal isn’t something Spain has been able to do recently. The Iberian neighbors have drawn their last four matches including friendlies, and Spain has not won at Portugal in nearly two decades.\n\nIts last victory against Portugal came in a penalty shootout in the semifinals of the 2012 European Championship, and before that it won in the round of 16 of the 2010 World Cup in a match where Portugal complained of an offside on David Villa’s winning goal in the second half.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn Portugal, Spain is winless since a 3-0 victory in a friendly in 2003, when Fernando Torres made his national debut with Spain, and not long after Cristiano Ronaldo began playing for Portugal.\n\n“It’s all part of soccer. We have three recent matches in which we played well but didn’t win and they ended in draws,” Luis Enrique said.\n\nThe teams have drawn four straight since coach Fernando Santos took over Portugal after the 2014 World Cup, including a thrilling 3-3 game to open their campaigns in the group stage of the 2018 World Cup.\n\n“We just have to focus on winning rather than reaching the final four,” Santos said on Monday. “I want the players to face Spain on their merit, as they do all opponents. Do that and we will always be closer to getting where we want to go.”\n\nSpain needs the victory after seeing its 22-game unbeaten run at home ended by Switzerland on Saturday. Portugal won 4-0 at the Czech Republic to take first place and earn a chance to advance with a draw on Tuesday.\n\nOnly the group winners advance to the final four next June. Portugal has 10 points, two more than Spain. Switzerland has six points, two more than the Czech Republic ahead of their match in Switzerland to try to avoid relegation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSpain is looking for its second consecutive appearance in the final four after finishing runner-up to France last year. At that time, it also needed a last-day victory to advance to the final four, and it did it by shocking Germany 6-0 at home.\n\nLuis Enrique said he didn’t expect many changes in the squad for the match against Portugal despite the loss on Saturday, though he admitted the team had to improve its defending of set pieces, which is how Switzerland scored both of its goals.\n\nPortugal, the winner of the inaugural edition of the Nations League in 2019, may see the return of forward João Félix, who was not available for the match against the Czech Republic because of an injury. He rejoined his teammates in training on Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nTales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni",
    "Braga’s Push to Break the Big Three Hegemony in Portugal": "Braga’s Push to Break the Big Three Hegemony in Portugal\n\nWidely considered to be the fourth club in a country dominated by ‘The Big Three’, SC Braga might just be on the cusp of breaking the hegemony in Portuguese football. Their excellent start to 2022-23 certainly has fans on the edge of their seats…\n\nSC Braga, under the tutelage of their new manager Artur Jorge, have started the season in spectacular form, both domestically and in European competition. Since drawing on the opening day of the Primeira Liga season at home to Sporting CP, Braga have gone on to win every single match – six in league, two in UEFA Europa League, scoring goals aplenty and attracting plaudits both in Portugal and across Europe for their breathtaking performances.\n\nPortugal’s Fourth Club\n\nBraga, particularly in the 21st century, have established themselves as Portugal’s fourth club. A club which strives to fight at the top of Portuguese football, battling to break through the glass ceiling to reach Os Tres Grandes or The Big Three, consisting of SL Benfica, FC Porto and Sporting CP. The last time they finished in the top three wasn’t too long ago, finishing third in 2019-20; a season where they took advantage of a Sporting CP that were seemingly in free-fall both off and on the pitch.\n\nBack in 2009-10, Braga recorded their best league campaign, finishing second under Domingos Paciência, picking up a fantastic 71 points and losing just three games all season. A year later, Braga managed to reach the UEFA Europa League final in Dublin, eventually losing to FC Porto 1-0 before Paciência was nabbed by Sporting CP in the summer. By and large though, Braga are usually found sitting just outside the top three, occupying fourth position. In fact, they’ve finished fourth in seven of the last 10 Portuguese top-flight seasons.\n\n2011 UEFA Europa League Final between Braga and Porto\n\nTheir electric start to 2022-23, however, has indicated that they may well be gunning to add another top-three finish to their record books. A key difference (and incentive) to note between the last time they went one further than the top three and finished second, is that due to Portugal’s coefficient ranking, Braga had to play UEFA Champions League qualifiers the following campaign in order to secure group stage football. This season however, a second-place finish would guarantee group stage football in Europe’s elite footballing competition, and third place would see them enter the qualifying rounds.\n\nNew Manager, New Ideas\n\nWhen Carlos Carvalhal, a manager who led Braga to a Taça de Portugal victory, consecutive fourth place finishes and to the UEFA Europa League quarter-finals, left the club at the end of last season to “embrace a new project”, Braga didn’t look to replace him with a manager of similar profile and experience, but instead opted to hand the reigns to one of their own, in the form of Artur Jorge.\n\nJorge, an ex-Braga player, has spent the majority of his coaching career working at the club in one capacity or another, whether it be as working as manager of Braga B, with the club’s U23 side or working with the youth teams at the club’s academy, as well as experiencing a month in charge of the first team as caretaker manager in 2020.\n\nThis season, Jorge has moved Braga away from the 3-4-3/3-4-2-1 formation that they often utilised under Carvalhal and before that, Rúben Amorim. The Braga boss has instead opted for a more traditional 4-4-2, allowing Simon Banza and either Abel Ruiz or Vitinha to work off one another up top.\n\nInterestingly, Artur Jorge’s approach this season hasn’t been to try and emulate Benfica, Porto and Sporting, instead they’re playing their own brand of more direct football, and it’s working.\n\nBraga have had the joint most shots (19) and scored the most goals (5) from high turnovers in Portugal so far this season. They don’t press as high up the pitch as the big three, but they time their press to perfection and only seem to press the opponent in their defensive third when they think that they’ll get a shooting opportunity from doing so.\n\nField tilt is a metric to show the territorial dominance between teams. Put simply, it measures the share of possession a team has in a game, considering only touches or passes in the attacking third. It can be useful when trying to understand which team is more dominant in games, rather than looking at overall possession, mainly as it looks at how teams are able to get the ball into areas that matter.\n\n\n\nWhen we look at the field tilt numbers in the Primeira Liga this season, the stark difference between Braga and the big three becomes even clearer. Benfica are currently averaging 84.6%, Sporting CP 77.1% and FC Porto slightly less with 71.9%, Braga however are currently averaging only 57.5%, taking fewer touches in the opposition third and completing fewer passes in the opposition third, yet they lead the league for goals scored (23).\n\nAs the graphic above shows, Braga are averaging less passes per sequence than the big three. In fact, Braga’s 3.4 passes per open play sequence actually means they are currently closer to promoted Casa Pia and Rio Ave (3.1 and 3.0 pps respectively) in that regard than to Benfica and Sporting (4.4 and 4.3 pps).\n\nThis directness from Braga starts at the first whistle and is a key reason why they’ve often started games on the front foot. 26.% of Braga’s goals so far this season in the Primeira Liga have been scored inside the first 15 minutes. In the match against Famalicão, Braga effectively killed the game off after 18 minutes, scoring twice and then managing the game brilliantly, allowing Famalicão to have possession in safe areas and then intelligently choosing when to hunt the ball back without leaving themselves exposed.\n\nAs the numbers indicate, Braga’s efficiency so far this season has been a key reason for their success. In front of goal, they have been ruthless. In the space of just over two weeks, Braga beat Famalicão 3-0, Marítimo 5-0 and Arouca 6-0 – 14 goals from 28 shots on target, meaning half their shots on target were hitting the back of the net.\n\nSC Braga players have scored 23 goals (excluding own goals) from an expected goals total of just 15.1 – a league-high overperformance of 7.9.\n\nOf course, it helps considerably when your top players are creating chances and firing on all cylinders when in front of goal. In Braga’s case, Ricardo Horta and Simon Banza, as well as several others, have started the season in emphatic fashion for Artur Jorge’s side.\n\nBanza’s exploits last season at Famalicão (18 goals and seven assists) were enough for Braga to bring him to the Estádio Municipal and give the Frenchman a platform to perform at the top end of the table and so far, he hasn’t disappointed. In his first five games of the season, he scored five goals and provided one assist for Braga.\n\nAnother talented forward that Braga have at their disposal is the exciting 22-year-old striker Vitinha, who himself has three goals and one assist in just six starts. Vitinha is generally very involved in the game for a traditional striker, averaging a healthy 31.7 touches per game, putting in 1.6 tackles per game and making 1.1 clearances per game. It was Vitinha’s smart rebound against Bundesliga leaders Union Berlin which gave Braga all three points away from home in the UEFA Europa League, a goal that epitomised his striker’s instinct.\n\nWhilst Braga will be delighted at both Banza and the rest of the teams’ goalscoring exploits, they will undoubtedly be aware that their potency in front of goal will not last forever. Their xG overperformance of 7.9 is probably not sustainable in the long term, thus they will be expecting a bit of a crash in front of goal soon. For further comparison, the biggest overperformance of xG across the whole of last season in Portugal was 5.3 by Tondela, while Benfica followed with 3.7 goals more than their xG total.\n\nKeeping Hold of Ricardo Horta\n\nIt’s impossible to talk about Braga’s superb start to the season without analysing their key man, the club’s all-time top scorer, the magnificent Ricardo Horta.\n\nThroughout the transfer window, Horta was the subject of a very publicised transfer saga linking him with a move to Lisbon giants SL Benfica, with The Eagles’ president Rui Costa admitting on several occasions that the club were very keen on signing the 28-year-old Portugal international. The interest in him was expected, Horta was hot off scoring 23 goals and providing 10 assists across all competitions, seeing him named in the Liga Portugal Team of the Season.\n\nUndoubtedly one of the best players in the division, it seemed almost inevitable at times that Horta would depart, and Braga would have to pick up the pieces to begin a search for a solution to the gaping hole their most influential player exiting would leave behind.\n\nHowever, when the transfer window slammed shut, Horta was still a Braga player. The club and its passionate supporters breathed a collective sigh of relief.\n\nIf you thought for a moment that this very public courting of Horta would in any way affect his morale and his performances going forward for Braga, you would be sorely mistaken. He has started the season in simply electric form. Some players can either create chances or take chances, Horta does both consistently with equal efficiency. His 56 attacking sequence involvements puts him second in the league behind Enzo Fernandéz, but what is remarkable about Horta’s numbers is how evenly distributed they are, 16 involvements in the build-up to shot, 18 chances created, and 22 shots shows that Horta isn’t currently excelling in just one particular area, but instead he’s doing it across the board. In terms of solely chances created, no player has created more than Horta so far this season (20) and only two players have created more from open play than he has (16).\n\nHorta’s consistency and efficiency when creating and taking chances means he is currently the league leader for combined goals and assists with seven, consisting of four goals (second most in the league) and three assists (most in the league).\n\nHis importance to Braga becomes even more obvious when his numbers are compared to the rest of his Braga team-mates. He is their key man and if they are to remain on their upward trajectory and potentially fight for a top three position, keeping Horta fit and firing will undoubtedly be key.\n\nA Brilliant Start, but That’s All It Is\n\nArtur Jorge’s side displayed character and heart on the opening day against Sporting, coming back from behind three times to take a well-earned point. Another test came in the form of their Minho rivals Vitória SC. This was a big test for Braga, who at this point had won three successive matches without conceding a goal but wary that on derby day, form can go out of the proverbial window. The result? Braga won 1-0 courtesy of a Vítor Tormena winner in the eighth minute of second-half stoppage time, which was nearly the final act of the match, with their rivals barely having time to kick-off. The best possible way to beat your fiercest rivals and maintain your winning streak.\n\nFast forward a few weeks to today and Braga remain unbeaten both domestically and in Europe, but they will not be getting carried away. A brilliant start is great, but it’s exactly that, a start. Their next match after the international break is a huge test of their credentials, a trip to the Estádio do Dragão to face defending champions FC Porto.\n\nSérgio Conceição’s men come into this one in poor form and lacking confidence, having won just twice in their last six matches in all competitions. On one hand, Braga will feel like it’s a great time to take on the Dragons, but on the other hand, this is a Porto side that will need no motivation, who know that defeat on the day will see them fall six points behind Braga.\n\nIf Braga are serious about usurping one of the big three, if only for this season, then it is in matches like this one that their credentials will really be examined. Lose and it’s not the end of the world, win and Braga fans will be in dreamland for yet another week.\n\nEnjoy this? Subscribe to our newsletter to receive five stories each Friday.",

    "Fernandes unleashed! Portugal winners, losers and ratings as Man Utd star makes up for Ronaldo disasterclass": "Winner: Bruno Fernandes\n\nWhat a performance! Truly unleashed by the midfield duo behind him, Fernandes roamed to all the right spots with Portugal in possession, posing constant danger with his movement and passing vision.\n\nRonaldo wasted two would-be assists in the first half, but no worries, Fernandes scored himself after a dart towards goal that Mario Rui picked out with a well-timed cross and contributed to the build-up on Dalot's opener, before assisting him for another goal in the second half.\n\nWinner: Diogo Dalot\n\nA second strong showing from a Manchester United player here, and one that cements his place as a starting line-up contender who could allow Joao Cancelo to play on the left side.\n\nDalot did the hard work on his first goal, carrying the ball from the midfield into the attacking third before making a smart run into the box to finish Leao's cut-back pass. His second strike was even better. He dribbled neatly in traffic onto his left foot and swung a long shot around the goalkeeper.\n\nPortugal's big hope at the World Cup is for their individual dynamism to create chances against even the strongest of defences.

He then assisted Dalot after a sprint to collect the ball before it rolled past the byline.\n\nYes, he was sloppy at times, and yes, Jota did score off the bench.

    "Portugal on a budget – Lonely Planet": "Portugal once had a sterling reputation as one of Europe’s most affordable destinations. Although prices have been on the rise in recent years (thanks in part to the nation’s growing popularity), you can still travel inexpensively here.\n\nMake the most out of every adventure with help from our weekly newsletter delivered to your inbox.\n\nPortugal’s parks and nature reserves are all free to visit, as is the wide array of trails and greenways. Starting the day with a bica (espresso) and a creamy pastel de nata (custard tart) will only set you back a few euros. The country also has many free museums and inexpensive attractions, from medieval architecture to cutting-edge contemporary art. If you’re thrifty, you can get by on as little as 50 euros a day.\n\nHere are some other key ways to cut costs while traveling in Portugal.\n\nFigure out the cheapest way to reach Portugal\n\nPortugal has international airports in Lisbon, Porto and Faro. Be sure to check prices at each before booking, as you may find better deals arriving in one or the other. If you’re considering combining a trip to Portugal with Spain, you might find cheaper rates flying into Madrid or even Sevilla, which is a two-hour train ride away from Tavira in southern Portugal.\n\nTake public transportation from the airport\n\nWhether you arrive in Lisbon, Porto or Faro, you can start your trip right by foregoing a pricey taxi ride and taking a bus or the metro to your destination. Handy metro service runs to city centers from Lisbon (red line) or Porto (violet line E). Faro’s airport has a quality bus service operated by Vamus Algarve. The Aerobus runs into Faro and also to Albufeira, Portimão and Lagos.\n\nInstead of using a rental car, opt to take the train or bus © Andrei Bortnikau / Alamy Stock Photo\n\nDitch the car and get around by train or bus\n\nThe high cost of rental cars coupled with soaring fuel prices can make for a pricey trip to Portugal. You can save money and lower your carbon footprint by traveling the country by train and bus. Portugal’s rail line connects major cities from Valença in the north down to Faro in the south, running through Porto, Coimbra and Lisbon. Portugal’s bus network helps fill in the gaps and connects smaller towns.\n\nTicket prices are reasonable. For instance, the second-class train fare from Lisbon to Lagos (a 4.5-hour journey) is around €25, which is not much more than the price you’d pay on tolls alone by taking the A2 to get there.\n\nVisit from October to April to save on lodging\n\nIn spring and autumn, you’ll generally find pleasant weather in Portugal, with blooming wildflowers in March and April and changing leaves in October in some parts of the country. You’ll also notice thinner crowds and lower rates when it comes to accommodation. Prices are typically around 25% off high season rates.\n\nYou can save even more by visiting from November to February. This is the cheapest time of the year to visit Portugal, and many hotels slash their rates by 50% or more. Just be sure to pack for the weather adequately. Bring a rain jacket, scarf and warm layers for Porto and other destinations in the north. In the south, you’ll still find plenty of sunshine in the Algarve, with mild temperatures for outdoor activities like hiking and biking.\n\nMake lunch your biggest meal\n\nMany restaurants in Portugal offer good-value lunch specials. Always ask if there's a menu do dia (fixed menu) or prato do dia (daily special). Even high-end restaurants typically have lower-priced lunch menus.\n\nIn the evening, you can forego conventional dining for a picnic in the park, at a viewpoint or overlooking the seaside. A loaf of fresh bread, cheese, olives and a bottle of wine makes the perfect accompaniment to watching the sunset.\n\nConsider staying in a hostel\n\nPortugal has many of Europe’s most stylish hostels, some of which are set in historic buildings and feature upscale amenities like roof terraces, art-filled lounges or swimming pools. Rates start at around €22 per night ­– big savings over a traditional hotel. Many hostels also offer budget-friendly activities, like free walking tours or pub crawls and free or low-cost rentals of bikes, surfboards and other gear. Some even host communal dinners, which are a great way to meet other people while saving money in the process.\n\nEven beach destinations like the Algarve have fabulous deals © wundervisuals / Getty Images\n\nPlan your itinerary around less expensive destinations\n\nDon’t rule out visiting Portugal’s most appealing cities. Places like Lisbon and Porto have a wide range of accommodations, and you can find excellent prices if you’re willing to stay outside the center (or in a more centrally located hostel). You can also find inexpensive activities (free museums, neighborhood exploring), and you won’t spend much on transportation.\n\nThe Algarve also has good deals if you know where to look. If you don’t want to stay in a hostel, you’ll find some of the best prices in Faro and Portimão. The Algarve is also among the best places for budget-friendly activities: scenic walks along headland trails above the beach and frolicking in the waves won’t cost you anything.\n\nDine in a tasca, adega and other local haunts\n\nNo matter where you roam, you can eat well in Portugal without breaking the bank if you know where to look. Among the key places to seek out is the tasca, an old-fashioned eatery (often with a loyal local following) that serves up excellent daily specials (which are not always listed on the menu) as well as classic staples like bacalhau (codfish) dished up many different ways. Slightly more convivial are adegas, usually decorated with wine casks and serving up hearty, inexpensive meals along with carafes of very affordable wine.\n\nPicnicking with ingredients from a local market is a must in Portugal – and also a cheaper alternative to a restaurant © T.W. van Urk / Shutterstock\n\nBecome a picnic expert\n\nSprinkled throughout Portugal, you’ll find mercados (markets), where you can browse for cheeses, charcuterie, baked goods and other fare. When no market is near, head to the nearest supermarket, where you can also score Portuguese produce at rock-bottom prices. With a bit of strategic planning, you can make a fun day out of your food shopping and sightseeing, stopping at a scenic spot for a picnic along the way.\n\nPlan your days around free and low-cost activities\n\nSome of the best things to do in Portugal won’t set you back much. A trip on a tram around Lisbon or Porto offers a great view of dynamic neighborhoods without the cost or hassle of taking a guided tour. Many churches are free to visit, as are parks and miradouros (viewpoints). Be sure to budget in downtime at cafes, where you can linger over inexpensive drinks while making plans for the day or evening ahead.\n\nIn the Algarve, you can design a day of beach hopping, followed by sunset viewing at one of the region's fabled overlooks (like the Cabo de São Vicente). You can also explore the islands of the eastern Algarve, reachable by inexpensive ferries from Faro, Olhão and Tavira.\n\nAt some restaurants in Portugal, a glass of wine can cost as much as a bottle of water © Alexander Spatari / Getty Images\n\nOrder the house wine\n\nPortugal has some excellent, affordable wines you can enjoy over dinner by ordering the house wine (vinho da casa). You can order by the glass or a carafe (jarro), ranging in size from 0.25 liters (around two glasses) to 0.75 liters. At many family-run eateries, a glass of house wine costs about the same as a bottle of water.\n\nTake a walk\n\nMountains and rugged coastlines make a memorable backdrop to one of Portugal’s greatest free outings: hitting the trail. You can plan your whole trip around a famous multi-day walk – like the Rota Vicentina that passes along sea cliffs and over deserted beaches on Portugal’s southwest coast. Or you can base near one of Portugal’s nature reserves and go on a day hike over craggy hillsides, beneath medieval ruins and through old stone villages – all features you’ll find in the Parque Nacional Peneda-Gerês in Portugal’s northeast.\n\nDaily costs\n\nHostel room: €22-35\n\nBasic room for two: €50-80\n\nSelf-catering apartment (including Airbnb): from €80\n\nLisbon metro ticket: €1.50\n\nMeia de leite (café latte): €2-3\n\nBifana (pork cutlet sandwich): €3-5\n\nDinner for two: from €30\n\nBeer at the bar: €2-4.50",
    "Americans Moving To Europe: Portugal Still Top Place For Expats Despite Restrictions": "Portugal, a favorite among expats getty\n\nHousing prices, political divisions, high cost of living, the rise of remote work, crime rates in some U.S. cities, a strong dollar now at parity with the euro for the first time in more than 20 years — these are among the reasons experts mention to explain the wave of Americans relocating to Europe, or planning to do so in the near future.\n\nSome have other, more personal reasons such as love for the European way of life, the food, wine, a job or following family members who have already moved to the old continent.\n\nIn a recent article entitled “Americans Who Can’t Afford Homes Are Moving to Europe Instead,” Bloomberg writes that the traditional trends of retirees and the wealthy as the prime American buyers of real estate in Europe have changed: “Relatively cheap housing — particularly in smaller cities and towns — and the rise of remote work have made the continent alluring to a wider range of people, including those who are younger and find themselves priced out of the housing market at home.”\n\nMORE FROM FORBES Why Are Vienna And Six Other European Cities The Best In The World To Live In?\n\nAmericans’ high demand for houses in Europe\n\nDigital nomad working from a beach terrace getty\n\nInternational real estate businesses release data every day showing a growing interest from American buyers, particularly concerning Portugal, Greece, Italy and Spain, among others, that offer special deals for golden visas, digital-nomad visas, green visas and lower-cost housing.\n\nIn the past few years, Portugal appears at the top of most of the lists of places recommended for expats and retired people to enjoy a good life and its golden visa program is one of the most popular in the world. The number of Americans living in Portugal rose 45% in 2021 from the previous year, according to government data.\n\nIn Spain, also a popular destination and hosting the largest American population in Europe, the number of U.S.-born residents rose 13% between 2019 and 2021 and demand continues to rise.\n\nSotheby’s International Realty has said that requests from Americans looking to move to Greece rose 40% in the April-to-June period this year compared to a year earlier. Ditto, Paris. In the rest of France, Greece, Spain and Italy, U.S. demand for houses is the highest in recent years.\n\nMORE FROM FORBES Ready To Move To Europe?

There are so many semi-abandoned small towns in Europe, with local officials searching for creative ways to revitalize their populations and economies — and with plenty of empty small houses, villas and even palaces to offer — that the number of international real state agencies and househunters working in the “€1 real estate market” market has multiplied.\n\nMORE FROM FORBES Ready To Move To Europe?

With the new changes in effect since last January the required Golden Visa minimum investment increased to €500,000.\n\nThe same as in Spain where the investment is at €500,000.\n\nThe golden visa also permits freedom of movement throughout the 27 E.U. countries,\n\nSo far this year, Portugal has collected €397.7 million through its golden visa program, SchengenVisaInfo.com reports.

Cities like Lisbon and Porto, highly popular among golden-visa investors, as well as the most developed coastal areas, are now out of reach in a bid to push foreign investors towards low-residency regions.\n\nThe properties qualifying for Golden Visa have to be located in the Autonomous Regions of the Azores and Madeira or in the interior territories,\n\nStill, as the numbers above show, the Portuguese visa-for-investment program keeps growing, particularly among American investors. “The U.S. has overtaken China as top source of applicants for Portugal’s Golden Visa,” the Portugal News explains.\n\nMORE FROM FORBES Want Property In Europe? €1 Houses, Digital Nomad Visas, Cash And Other Enticing Offers\n\n“With about 5% rental income per year and capital appreciation of up to 4% a year, residential units in the interior of Portugal are still an attractive proposition,” World Finance reports.\n\nGreece, another favorite among expats and digital nomads, has announced it will implement changes in its visa-for-investment program, the main alteration a doubling of the minimum amount of investment required to €500,000.\n\nThe measure, according to local media, was made among other reasons to help free up more affordable housing for Greece nationals.\n\nThe changes are expected to take place early in 2023.",

Plate invited the Government of Portugal to support Indonesia to become a member of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Council for the 2023-2026 period, representing the Asia-Pacific region.\"We know that Portugal is part of the European Union (EU), (so we have a meeting with Portugal since) we need allies from the members of EU (to support our candidacy),” the Indonesian minister remarked in a press release on Sunday during Plate's working visit to Portugal.Plate affirmed that his invitation was welcomed by the representative of the Government of Portugal, and there was a high potential for the country to support Indonesia at the ITU Council member election, especially considering the sound relations between both nations.\"Hopefully, they will support us. Considering his gestures and commitments, Minister Mario (Campolargo) highly supports our candidacy,” Plate said after meeting with Portuguese Secretary of State for Digitalization and Modernization of Administration Affairs Mario Campolargo to discuss cooperation potentials in the digital sector.Furthermore, he stated that by becoming the ITU Council member, Indonesia would be able to propose more fair use of telecommunication and information technology, such as the satellite orbit slots and communication device spectrum arrangements, for all countries, including for developed, developing, and least developed nations.Indonesia has pushed for three agendas in its candidacy: capacity building, women's empowerment, as well as connecting the unconnected.In addition to the candidacy as the ITU Council member, Indonesia strives to gather support for the candidacy of an Indonesian telecommunication expert, Meiditomo Sutyarjoko, as a member of the ITU Radio Regulation Board (RRB).Hence, since mid-2022, the Communication and Informatics Ministry had been actively garnering support for the success of the candidacies.Numerous bilateral meetings were conducted with various representatives from several countries, such as Germany, Japan, and Portugal, to bolster international support for Indonesia’s candidacy.The attempt is expected to garner many votes for Indonesia at the ITU Council member election that will be held in coincidence with the implementation of the ITU Plenipotentiary Conference 2022 in Bucharest, Romania, from September 26 to October 14, 2022.",

    "Portugal’s Next Great Beach Vacation Destination: Ericeira": "The new Aethos Ericeira hotel Francisco Nogueira\n\nTo be fair, Portugal’s Ericeira, about an hour northwest of Lisbon, isn’t exactly some brand new discovery. It’s been on the radar for a while now—at least for surfers. Its waves are more accessible than the gigantic ones up the coast at Nazaré, but reliably interesting for a range of skill levels, which is why it’s Europe’s only “surf reserve.” But while the town itself retains a lot of the charm of the fishing village that it once was, its services have tended toward hostels, surf schools and cafés serving açaí and quinoa bowls.\n\nThat changed this summer with the opening of two new five-star hotels in the general surroundings of the town—not walking distance but within easy reach if you come with a car. (Call them Ericeir-ish.) Surfers are still more than welcome of course, but they also offer quite a lot to people who don’t care about chasing waves. And, joining with the existing hotel You and the Sea, they’re set to change the appeal and perception of Ericeira.\n\nTo be sure, Ericeira is unlikely to become the new Comporta, at least not anytime soon. But now it’s turning into a place that promises its own brand of slow travel. It’s a destination for people who appreciate nature (not just beaches), stylish design, quality materials and good food, but without the glamour or the need to see and be seen.\n\nImmerso Francisco Nogueira\n\nThe first hotel to change the perception and position of Ericeira is Immerso (as in “immersion in nature”), which opened earlier, and which is built into a hillside to help it blend into its surroundings and to ensure that each of the 37 rooms has an excellent ocean view, especially at sunset. In fact, the television is to the side of the bed, making it a bit awkward to watch—the idea is to look straight ahead, out the window, instead.\n\nThe design, by Portuguese architect Tiago Silva Dias and designers Alexandra Almeida d’Eca (one of the founders of the hotel) and Bárbara Neto, is simple, with concrete floors, woven rugs in natural colors, organic shapes, artisan furnishings and textures from the land and sea. They worked a number of artists on items for the rooms, indoor lounge, long terrace and pool deck and fire pit.\n\nThe spa is more ambitious than it needs to be, with heat and wet areas, three treatment rooms and a menu of services based on the vegan, natural skincare brand Vinoble Cosmetics. The massage list ranges from Japanese shiatsu to hot stones to Ayurveda.\n\nEmme restaurant at Immerso Francisco Nogueira\n\nThe restaurant, Emme, also takes its cues from the hotel owners’ conscious, local and natural philosophy. Dogma aside, its quite good, with a brief but tasty menu, a lively relaxed dining room and snappy service. The consulting chef is Alexandre Silva, who holds a Michelin star at his Lisbon restaurant Loco and earned a reputation for his excellent cooking with fire at Lisbon’s Fogo and the Alentejo’s Craveiral FarmTable.\n\nExecuted here by resident chef Paulo Pedro (ex-Fortaleza do Guincho), the menu is strong on local fish and seafood—the trio of oysters is an excellent starter, and the simple main courses are tasty—with some vegetables from the organic kitchen garden and saline-tasting plants from the sea mixed in. The spread for the breakfast buffet is well above average. When it opens later this autumn, Emme on Fire will be an outdoor, communal dining experience based on food cooked over an open fire—what they’re calling a “medievally festive” experience.\n\nBy coincidence, Immerso was joined last week by Aethos Ericeira, an unrelated hotel that also happens to prioritize consciousness, nature, community, wellness and design. On top of a 130-foot-high cliff in a nature reserve, it has spectacular natural light and lovely views over the Atlantic. It’s part of the the Aethos group (after the Greek “ethos,” or characteristic spirit of a culture), a collection of members clubs and boutique hotels in Europe that was founded by a pair of international serial entrepreneurs who want to create a “global family of conscious explorers.”\n\nThe lounge at Aethos Ericeira Francisco Nogueira\n\nAt the Ericeira hotel, which was designed by the Barcelona studio Astet and Portuguese architect Luís Pedra Silva, that means 50 suites and rooms that blend natural tones, materials and textures with the clean lines and soft simplicity of modernist design. The premium rooms have glorious views over the ocean, sometimes with private terraces.\n\nAt the restaurant, Onda (“wave”), chef Afonso Blazquez and his team focus on shareable, sustainable fish and seafood from the surrounding coast, with plenty of vegetables in the mix. The dinner menu includes dishes like asparagus with fresh green curry, bergamot gel and sourdough croutons, and squid “noodles” with pickled mushrooms and dashi. The oysters here are excellent as well.\n\nIn line with the Aethos philosophy, there’s a strong wellness component, including a spa that uses organic products from Sweden’s Under the Skin brand, a gym with expert trainers, yoga classes with world-class instructors, a meditation deck overlooking the Atlantic and a stone-trimmed saltwater pool. But this Ericeira—and surfing checks quite a few of those same wellness boxes. (I dare you to think about anything other than surfing when you’re doing it.)\n\nA guest room at Aethos Ericeira Francisco Nogueira\n\nAnd Aethos being a five-star hotel, it has its own luxury take on the sport. It has a dedicated surf concierge, onsite storage facilities for boards and wetsuits, and onsite rentals. It also has a relationship with Joana Andrade, Portugal’s first female big wave surfer and champion several times over. She also started Portugal’s first female surf school in 1998, and continues to coach professionals as well as beginners.\n\nAethos guests of any skill level can book a private session with her and accomplish quite a lot in terms of skills and especially confidence in a short time. It’s a luxury version of surfing for sure, and also very much in line with the new direction of Ericeira.",

    "Legislative Changes Regarding Visas And Residence Permits In Portugal": "A new visa is created which allows entry into Portugal for people who intend to come here to seek work.\n\nIts aim is to (i) create the conditions to implement the Agreement on Mobility between the Member States of the CPLP of 17 July 2021, (ii) amend Law 23/2007 of 4 July, which approves the legal rules for the entry, stay, exit and expulsion of foreigners from Portuguese territory; (iii) amend Law 27/2008 of 30 June, which establishes the conditions and procedures for granting asylum or subsidiary protection, and the status of asylum seekers, refugees and subsidiary protection; (iv) implement into the Portuguese legal system the provisions of Law 27/2008 of 30 June, which establishes the conditions and procedures for granting asylum and subsidiary protection; and (iv) incorporate into Portuguese law Regulations (EU) 2018/1860, 2018/1861 and 2018/1862 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 November 2018, on the establishment, operation and use of the Schengen Information System. This law came into force on 26 August 2022 and its main points are:\n\n1. Visa for seeking work in Portugal\n\nA new visa is created for a period of 120 days, which can be extended for a further 60 days, which allows entry into Portugal for people who intend to come here to seek work. This visa will enable its holder to enter and remain in Portugal to seek work provided they comply with certain requirements. It authorises the holder to work as a dependent worker until the expiry of the visa or until a residence permit is granted. The visa for job seekers includes an appointment date with the SEF (Foreigners and Borders Service), within the 120 days referred to above. After the establishment and formalisation of the employment relationship within that period, it entitles the holder to apply for a temporary residence permit, provided that he or she fulfils the general conditions for it to be granted. An employment relationship must be established by the end of the maximum limit of validity of the visa to seek work and the subsequent process of document regularisation must have been started. If this does not happen, the holder of the visa will have to leave the country and can only reapply for a new visa for this purpose one year after the expiry of the previous visa.\n\n2. Temporary stay and residence visa for \"digital nomads\"\n\nThis law also establishes the possibility of granting a residence visa to employees and self-employed professionals to work remotely. These visas can be issued to individuals or companies with their domicile or registered office outside Portugal. The employment relationship or provision of services relationship, as appropriate, must be demonstrated.\n\n3. Issuance of residence pre-authorisation and consequent automatic allocation of provisional NIF, NISS and SNS numbers based on the residence permit.\n\nUnder this law, a residence pre-authorisation is issued upon the granting of the residence visa. This pre-authorisation contains information regarding the obtaining of the residence permit and the provisional allocation of the NIF (tax identification number), NISS (Social Security number) and SNS (National Health Service number).\n\n4. Elimination of quotas in the visa to work as an employee\n\nThe new law also abolishes the quota rules for residence visas for work as an employee. This rule had not been applied for around 3 years as a result of the State Budget Law.\n\n5. Creation of the Residence Permit for citizens from the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP):\n\nUnder the Agreement on Mobility between the Member States of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries concluded in Luanda on 17 July 2021 (CPLP Agreement), special conditions for granting visas to nationals of CPLP Member States are introduced:\n\nThe SEF's prior opinion is no longer necessary, and the offices responsible for issuing the visa will consult the Schengen Information System (SIS) databases directly and immediately.\n\nA refusal to issue a visa may only occur if there is an indication of a prohibition on entry and stay in the SIS, or if the citizen is a minor and does not have authorisation to travel.\n\nThe issuance of the visa is automatically communicated to the SEF.\n\n6. Residence Visa for family members of a holder of a temporary residence visa to accompany the holder\n\nAnother significant innovation in this law relates to the creation of a new temporary stay visa to allow the family of the holder of a temporary stay visa to accompany that holder. This visa may be requested simultaneously and will make it easier for family members of citizens who intend to establish themselves in Portugal to accompany them.\n\nIn the Expression of Interest in working as an employee or as a self-employed professional, it is now also possible to identify the members of the family of that person who are in Portugal. These family members will then benefit from the presumption of legal entry of the applicant, if applicable.\n\n7. Duration of residence permits\n\nWith this law, the general rule of validity of the residence permits is now:\n\nGeneral rule: Issued for an initial period (concession) of 2 years, renewable for periods of 3 years. This was already the position set out in the 2020 State Budget, and it has now become definitive.In turn, there are exceptions:\n\ni) Residence Permit for Investment (\"ARI\" or \"Golden Visa\") is issued for an initial period of 2 years, renewable for equal periods (the 3-year renewal rule does not apply).\n\nii) Residence Permit for Higher Education is now issued initially for 3 years and renewable for equal periods, and if the programme has a shorter duration, it will be issued for the duration of the programme.\n\niii) Residence Permit for Researchers is initially valid for 2 years, renewable for equal periods or for the duration of the hosting agreement if this is less than 2 years.\n\niv) Residence Permit for Interns is initially valid for six months, for the duration of the internship programme, plus a period of three months, if this is less than six months, or for 2 years in the case of a long-term internship. In this case, it may be renewed once for the remaining period of the internship programme.\n\nv) Travel permits for refugees will now be issued for periods of 5 years (instead of 1 year, as was previously the case), subject to renewals associated with any future renewal of the residence permit. The authenticity control will now be identical to that of the Portuguese electronic passport.",

Here’s one from a more leftfield team, promising unique country-in-the-city ambiance: Hotel das Amoreiras, on one of the most photogenic squares in the (already pretty ready for its close-up) enclave of Príncipe Real. Pedro Oliveira and Alicia Valero brought experience in private banking and luxury marketing respectively to their dream of opening a very small, special hotel.

In June, Immerso opened here, bringing a high-bar hospitality that privileges wellness and local experiences (artisan visits and, yes, surf lessons) to the enclave. Now it’s the turn of Aethos, a hotel/nomadic traveller-private members’ club concept based in Milan that also has small boutique hotels in Umbria and Corsica (and will soon add Lisbon and Mallorca to the portfolio as well).\n\nThe ocean suite at Aethos © Przemyslaw Nieciecki\n\nOnda restaurant at Aethos © Przemyslaw Nieciecki\n\nThe 46 rooms and four suites at Aethos Ericeira hover cliffside in a sleek three-storey building some 40m above the ocean.

It’s where Miguel and Sofia Charters recently opened Pa.te.os – four discrete houses, immersed in cork and arbutus groves a couple of miles inland from the Atlantic. Like an extremely understated compound, they group loosely in 80 hectares of land – separate, private, but not distant from each other.\n\nA living area in one of the Pa.te.os houses © Francisco Nogueira\n\nThe sublime is in the palette and materials: Manuel Aires Mateus, the Portuguese architect of the moment (though he’s been that for a decade now) has invented incredible care into materials and palette. All is sand or pearl, caramel or bone: the warm tones of the earth, stone and wood that were the only materials deployed in Pa.te.os’ creation.

My congratulations are more for the Portuguese people, who in a serene, exemplary, and calm way elected you and the PS to be at the head of the country's destiny,\" pointed out the Mozambican head of state.\n\nFor his part, the Portuguese Prime Minister reaffirmed \"Portugal's full commitment to continue working with Mozambique, both in facing the difficulties and also to be able to contribute so that Mozambique may take full advantage of all its potentialities.\n\n\"And I think that this summit, as we already have a new strategic program, as we already have a new framework program in the area of defense, opens up prospects for us to take a very important leap forward in the traditional areas of sovereignty, health, education and especially in the diversification of the economy, not only in those areas as important as energy, but also in agriculture, which are areas of great potential for the future of Mozambique,\" he stressed.\n\n\"Thank you very much, Mr. President, for the opportunity to work together again,\" said António Costa, who also noted the hospitality with which he was received in Maputo.\n\nThe head of the Portuguese government said it is \"always a great pleasure\" to return to the city where his father was born, considering it is like finding in Maputo a bit of his roots.\n\nCosta congratulated Mozambique for \"its recent election, unanimously, as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council\", considering that the vote \"was total, 192 votes, an absolutely extraordinary result\".\n\nRecalling that the last summit between the two countries was in 2019, in Lisbon, the prime minister pointed out that \"it was a very promising moment for Mozambique, it was a very short time away from taking a new step in the consolidation of peace.\"\n\n\"I wanted to congratulate, as the whole process of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration has been going on, the progress that Mozambique has meanwhile registered from the economic point of view, the fact that today the International Monetary Fund has reopened financing to Mozambique,\" he said, also highlighting \"the advances it has had in the fight against terrorism in the north.\"\n\nThe prime minister also stressed \"the great understanding that President [Nyusi] expressed for the postponement\" of this summit, which was scheduled for mid-July, \"in view of the serious fire risk that Portugal would experience that week.\n\nAntónio Costa's official visit to Mozambique started today, with a tribute ceremony at the Monument to Mozambican Heroes, and ends on Friday.",

    "Portugal awaits assessment of two lithium mines before launching auction": "Demonstrators protest against lithium mines in downtown Lisbon, Portugal September 21, 2019. The placards read \"Lithium Not\". REUTERS/Rafael Marchante\n\nLISBON, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Portugal will not commit to setting a new date for a long-awaited auction of lithium mining licences as it awaits the conclusion of ongoing environmental impact studies at two sites, Energy Secretary Joao Galamba said on Wednesday.\n\nThe southern European nation, which has 60,000 tonnes of known lithium reserves, is central to Europe's bid to secure more of the battery value chain and cut reliance on imports.

    "Australians Choose Portugal’s Golden Visa as Europe’s Favorite Program": "Wealthy internationals from Australia have turned their eyes to Portugal’s Golden Visa Program, considering it a great opportunity to acquire residency in this European country.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nPortugal’s Golden Visa scheme, allows internationals to acquire residency in this country if they invest at least €500,000 while they also can benefit from the visa exemption thus being eligible to travel to all the Schengen zone countries without being required to apply for a visa at first, SchengenVisaInfo.com reports.\n\n“We have seen a surge in Australian investors taking advantage of this and purchasing the quality homes on offer. Through the program, investors and their dependents can obtain a Portuguese passport after five years without relocating to Portugal,” CEO Ideal Homes Portugal, Chris White, pointed out in this regard.\n\nFollowing the Residency by Investment Program (RIP), applicants are required to spend at least seven days in the dist year and 14 in subsequent years.\n\nIn this regard, White added that this means people can be granted citizenship without actually living in this country, stressing that this is different to many other countries worldwide.\n\n“With its warm climate, stunning beaches, fine cuisine and laid-back lifestyle, Portugal is one of the most attractive countries for overseas investors looking to live, work or retire in the EU. Savvy investors realize that the market is likely to get hotter and are jumping in now,” White pointed out.\n\nInternational interest in Portugal’s Golden Visa program has marked a significant increase in recent years.\n\nBesides, recently, SchengenVisaInfo.com reported that the interest of United States nationals in Portugal’s Golden Visa had increased notably. The number of applications filed by US natonals for Portugal’s Golden Visa Scheme surpassed those from China nationals in the first six months of 2022 accounting for the largest country of origin for applications for Portugal’s Residency by Investment Programs.\n\nThe Golden Visa Program of Portugal was introduced back in 2012 and since then has been among the most famous programs of this kind in Europe.\n\nAccording to the data provided by Portugal’s Immigration and Border Service, from a total of 649 successful residencies by investment applications filed in the first half of this year, 124 applications, or 19 per cent, were from the United States, and only 105 were from China. At the same time, in 2014, in the second year of this program, applicants from China obtained 1,200 Golden Visas or 81 per cent of the total awarded this year.\n\nEven though the program attracts a large number of internationals and makes a significant contribution to the economic sector, it has been criticized for being involved in unlawful affairs, while authorities in EU countries have continuously called the countries that run such schemes to terminate them.",
    "Health authorities working with community stakeholders to control Monkeypox in Portugal": "During 3–12 May 2022, 2 sexual health clinics in Lisbon, Portugal were concerned to see a small number of patients presenting with unusual genital lesions, rashes and systemic symptoms including fever and swollen lymph nodes.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Margarida Tavares is Director of the National Programme for Sexually Transmitted Infections and HIV Infection and an infectious diseases consultant at Centro Hospitalar Universitário de São João, in Porto and remembers how they were at a loss to explain the disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n“At that time, it wasn’t clear what was causing these symptoms, but the correlation of having a number of similar cases within the same period of time made us question what was happening, and report them so that we could hopefully get some answers.”\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentification of monkeypox\n\n\n\n\n\nWithout being able to give a diagnosis, the National Reference Laboratory logged the unexplained cases on the EpiPulse online portal – a tool set up by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) through which European public health authorities and global partners can collect, analyse, share and monitor infectious disease data.\n\n\n\n\n\nThree days later, the United Kingdom reported 4 laboratory-confirmed monkeypox infections, which allowed the Lisbon authorities to “join the dots” and get confirmation that they were also dealing with a monkeypox outbreak.\n\nResponding to the outbreak and involving civil society\n\n\n\nAs soon as the first case was confirmed as monkeypox virus, a rapid response team was set up on 17 May, consisting of sub-teams responsible for key response pillars (including coordination, clinical management, laboratory analysis, vaccination, epidemiological surveillance and risk communication).\n\n\n\n\n\nRight from the start, this team began a close dialogue with community-based organizations working with men who have sex with men (MSM), as it was in this group that the vast majority of cases were being found. The team also liaised with sexually transmitted infection (STI)/HIV testing and care centres, as well as venues, such as bars and sex-on-premises businesses, to consult them on key messages around monkeypox and the best approach for communicating them, particularly in the run-up to the upcoming Pride events Marcha do Orgulho on 18 June and Arraial Lisboa Pride on 25 June.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Together, the Pride events attract up to 100 000 participants, and are the highlight of the city’s LGBTQI+ calendar. They offered us a perfect opportunity to identify feasible and clear messages, to spread the word about monkeypox to those at most risk from infection, and to provide information on the symptoms to look out for, ways to avoid it and what to do about it if you catch it,” explained Ricardo Fuertes, a psychologist working at the National Programme and liaison with the community.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time that messages were being disseminated at Pride events, testing venues and hospitals readied to receive patients concerned about their symptoms in other parts of the city and the country.\n\n\n\nEvent organizers being part of the solution\n\n\n\nOrganizers of the two Pride events, together with Grupo de Ativistas em Tratamentos (GAT), a community-based organization that carries out counselling and testing for HIV and other STIs, were also involved in the design and distribution of informative materials, including a pocket-sized, bilingual guide (in Portuguese and English) that used images of a prickly gherkin to draw attention to the lesions and rashes characteristic of monkeypox. In addition, the organizers were provided with briefing information for staff, and were involved in the production of educational videos that were shown on large public screens at one of the events.\n\n\n\nRapid responses in coordination with the community\n\n\n\nThe health authorities in Portugal made the most of existing contacts and networks of community services and representatives – relationships developed in response to HIV and their work with MSM, migrants and sex workers – to respond quickly. Community representatives were consulted before announcements to the national media, and venues such as bars and saunas were engaged and encouraged to put up information posters.\n\n\n\n\n\n“This alliance between health authorities, event organizers, community organizations and venues was crucial to our response,” says Dr Tavares. “And over time, this alliance has expanded as we realized we needed to include other subgroups, such as chemsex networks, and new geographic areas, such as Porto.”\n\n\n\n\n\nGAT and the national health authority worked together to set up a monkeypox helpline to answer questions around disease infection, transmission and vaccination, as well as where to get tested in case of suspected infection.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Tavares and Ricardo Fuertes believe that being pragmatic about the prevention measures being recommended and targeting the most at-risk groups, without stigmatizing or blaming have been important factors in getting people to take notice of their messages and in the success of their campaign. While Portugal continues to see monkeypox cases reported, the country was one of the first to show signs of stabilizing transmission. Now, the work is to focus on bringing case numbers down further, and stopping the outbreak entirely.\n\n\n\nPreparing for a national vaccination programme\n\n\n\nSimilar steps to those described above are now being taken in preparation for the roll-out of a national preventive vaccination programme. Community partners and venue owners have once again been consulted on many of the practical considerations needed for this, including deciding on the appropriate eligibility criteria for vaccination, the location of vaccination points and the way that information will be communicated to reach those at most at risk.\n\n\n\n\n\nGAT’s CheckpointLX, a screening centre for HIV and other STIs, is playing a key role in these plans and has already been designated as one of the 3 vaccination points for monkeypox in the Lisbon metropolitan area due to its close links to the most at risk MSM communities. With vaccines as a new tool in the response for Portugal, the continued engagement and involvement of the affected community in all its interventions will be the key to ending the outbreak in the country.",
    "This Coastal Town in Portugal Is a Hidden Gem — With Scenic Beaches, Beautiful Architecture, and Few Crowds": "When you hear about Portugal, popular cities like Lisbon and Porto or the beautiful beaches of the Algarve region likely come up. However, the country known for its spectacular seafood, award-winning wines, and milder temperatures is also full of natural, cultural, and historical wonders.\n\nLocated under an hour from Lisbon, Azenhas do Mar is a stunning coastal town with just about 800 inhabitants. It's situated on top of a cliff by the sea, with white houses that exude a Greek feel.\n\nHenrique Feliciano Photography/Getty Images\n\nBefore entering the village, stop at the lookout opposite to observe the Portuguese jewel. If the day is warm and the sea calm, it can be a tempting invitation to bathe in the natural pool at the base of the rocky wall, allegedly carved in the mid-20th century. When the tide is high, the pool becomes invisible, and you'll see only the waves crashing against the immense cliff.\n\nthenorthernmonkey/Getty Images\n\nThe origin of the village is not fully known, but it is linked to the several water mills called azenhas, which gave the place its name; it is speculated the first water mills here were from the Arab occupation period. The local tradition had agriculture, milling, fishing, and shellfish gathering as its main activities, and its development as a seaside resort only happened in the mid-1930s, when the Sintra tramway was inaugurated. If you're in the historical center (Sintra), a trip to Azenhas will take between 15 and 20 minutes by bus; it's also possible to visit the famous Cabo da Roca, the westernmost point in continental Europe, on the same day.\n\nAndré Aram\n\nIn addition to admiring the scenery, visitors can taste regional delicacies during their trip. Next to the ocean pool lies a popular restaurant set into the rock with several seating options, one of them open with a view of the sea. Besides the beach, it's fascinating to walk around the village, observing the buildings that follow a \"soft Portuguese\" trend, a local architectural style.\n\nOverall, Azenhas do Mar is a picturesque place, ideal for relaxing, enjoying the beautiful vistas, appreciating the silence, and visiting without haste. It's even possible to stay overnight in one of the houses in the village, available on specific sites for seasonal rentals.\n\nAndré Aram\n\nThe Azenhas do Mar landscape is like a postcard, still unknown to many foreigners and popular among the Portuguese, so much so that it has served as inspiration for renowned writers like José Saramago, winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature. The place is perfect for a relaxing getaway, to feel and listen to the energy of the sea, away from the crowds.",

The action is likely to proceed peacefully though isolated clashes with security services cannot be ruled out.\n\nAdvice\n\nAvoid the demonstration as a routine security precaution and to mitigate associated disruptions. Heed instructions from security services and leave the area at the first sign of a confrontation. Check for disruptions and allow extra time for travel in the affected area the evening of Sept. 5.",
    "Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal comments show Erik ten Hag has a Manchester United weapon to use": "Get the latest on new manager Erik ten Hag, transfers and United team news delivered straight to your inbox every day for free\n\nThey are the type of numbers that seem inconceivable at first glance. Then you remember we are talking about one of the greatest players in the history of the game.\n\nBy the time the World Cup comes around in two months, Cristiano Ronaldo will be on the cusp of 200 caps for his beloved Portugal — not to mention more than 100 goals. When it comes to representing his country, there is no question of his importance to the side, even though he is less than five months out from turning 38.\n\nWhile all is rosy on the international front, the superstar has been in the headlines for the wrong type of reasons. Namely, the summer-long saga involving his future at Manchester United.\n\nRead more: Neves gives Ronaldo verdict amid United speculation\n\nThe whole episode did not cover him in any glory and understandably a portion of United fans are keen for him to be shipped off in January if possible. Many wanted him gone as soon as it was made aware he wished to leave in the summer. Whatever the reasons behind it, it didn't happen and he's stayed put.\n\nThat is not to say he cannot play his part this season and, who knows, maybe even further beyond that.\n\nErik ten Hag has so far been content to use Ronaldo sporadically, with just one league start since he walked in the door (albeit there was the caveat of him missing pre-season due to a personal issue).\n\nBut given the fixture congestion that lies ahead, the Dutchman will surely be banking on being able to call upon Ronaldo on a more consistent basis as the season goes on. At 37, he does not have the luxury of being able to wait around months. He needs game time to build fitness for the World Cup, and if that means Europa League matches or Nations League assignments for his country then so be it.\n\nSome have questioned his commitment to the cause but you only have to look at his stance when it comes to Portugal duty. Ronaldo rarely, if ever, shirks call-ups and a measure of his desire to continue playing at the highest level was evident with his latest comments. He was asked whether the upcoming World Cup in Qatar was likely to be his swansong with his country and his answer was unequivocally clear.\n\n\"It has been a long road, but I would like to say that my road is not over yet. (You're going to have to) take a little more road from me,\" said Ronaldo.\n\n\"I hope to be part of the federation (team) for a few more years. I still feel motivated; my ambition is high. I'm in a team with young people. I want to be part of this World Cup and the European too; I'm going to assume that right away.\"\n\nHis longevity, in terms of consistently performing at the highest levels in the sport, may never be witnessed again.\n\nWhile he may not be the player United had first time around, or even the one we saw last year, you should never rule him out. The fire is clearly still burning deep within.\n\nREAD NEXT:",

    "Portugal Preparing 10 GW Offshore Wind Auction for 2023": "Portugal will offer 10 GW of capacity through the country’s first offshore wind auction expected to take place in 2023, according to Portugal’s Environment Minister Duarte Cordeiro.\n\nPortugal had originally planned to offer between 6 GW and 8 GW of offshore wind capacity in the first auction.\n\nRelated Article Posted: 3 months ago Portugal Postpones First Offshore Wind Auction, Doubles Capacity Target Posted: 3 months ago\n\nThe increase in the capacity target is part of the Portuguese government’s plan to speed up the country’s energy transition.\n\nThis is the second capacity increase for the country’s debut offshore wind auction. Portugal had initially planned to hold the first auction in 2022 and offer up to 4 GW of capacity in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n”We have already launched the working group to prepare the 10-gigawatt offshore Eolic tender so that we can increase our capacity to increase renewable energy for this type of industry,” Minister Cordeiro was quoted as saying by O Jornal Economico.\n\nBack in 2017, the Portuguese Government approved the Industrial Strategy for Ocean Renewable Energies (EI-ERO), with an aim of developing the country’s offshore wind potential, according to which the potential for offshore wind installation in Portugal is much more significant for floating turbines (40 GW), than for fixed ones (1.4 to 3.5 GW).\n\nAccording to estimations from the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC), the Ocean Renewable Energy Action Coalition (OREAC), and the World Bank’s Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP), Portugal’s offshore wind technical potential is 131 GW: 117 GW for floating wind and 14 GW for bottom-fixed.\n\nPortugal already has a floating wind farm up and running, the 25 MW Windfloat Atlantic, which has been operational since July 2020. The project features three MHI Vestas 8.4 MW turbines mounted on Principle Power’s semi-submersible floating foundations.\n\nFollow offshoreWIND.biz on:",

The challenge was to create a wellness and mindfulness center based on the idea of community life at Serra da Estrela Nature Park, a UNESCO Global Geopark site and Portugal’s oldest and largest conservation area. The chosen property already included a number of preexisting buildings, which allowed developing the project despite the many constraints that limit any intervention in a conservation area.\n\nThe New Life Portugal wanted to make the most of the property’s excellent conditions to offer meditation, yoga, counselling, coaching, fitness, nature and mindfulness activities. So, the various facilities were designed with the goal of establishing a close relationship between the views and the surrounding nature and the concept of wellness, maximizing it.\n\nThe traditional buildings of the old “quintas” were transformed into accommodation units, while the program for the community facilities was the theme for designing contemporary buildings. Transforming the ruins implied their expansion, focused on the use of cork – a natural material that has optimal thermal insulation characteristics and an excellent aesthetic potential – to mark the difference between the old and the new.\n\nThe refurbishment of the 10 preexisting ruins allowed creating 4 residential clusters with a total of 49 private ensuite units, customized in order to guarantee a balanced combination of privacy and community life. The community facilities include a multifunctional community center, a meditation hall and a therapy center, in addition to the reception building.\n\nThe multifunctional community center, focused on relaxing and unwinding, is the social hub of the community, comprising a dining hall, a lounge area, a gym (which is also used for workshops, yoga sessions and meetings), an outdoor heated swimming pool, a sauna and a massage room.\n\nThe stunning meditation hall offers panoramic views over the valley. It is located at one of the highest sites of the property and creates the perfect atmosphere for meditation, yoga and mindfulness activities by making the most of the beauty of Serra da Estrela.\n\nThe therapy center comprises a number of rooms for one-on-one counselling and life coaching sessions, among other therapeutic activities, ensuring the necessary tranquility and comfort for restorative healing. This combination of modernity and traditional Portuguese architecture and materials, that fosters a strong communion with Nature, invites guests to feel a sense of openness in their search for balance between body and mind.",
