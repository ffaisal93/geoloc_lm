(David Mareuil/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nHarris and Kishida Affirm ‘Ironclad Commitment’ to Counter CCP Aggression in Taiwan Strait\n\nDuring a Sept. 26 meeting between U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in Tokyo, the two leaders affirmed their nations’ support for one another and condemned Chinese communist aggression in the Taiwan Strait.\n\n“The Vice President underscored that the U.S.–Japan Alliance is the cornerstone of peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific, and they discussed efforts to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific,” the White House said in a statement.\n\nHarris is in Japan this week to lead the U.S. delegation for the state funeral of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who was assassinated in July.\n\nAbe was widely regarded as one of the foremost champions of the U.S.–Japan alliance. He was hailed as a defender of democracy for his efforts to design and implement the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue between Japan, the United States, Australia, and India—colloquially referred to as the “Quad.”\n\n“The Vice President praised former Prime Minister Abe as a champion of the U.S.–Japan Alliance and a free and open Indo-Pacific, and affirmed the United States’ commitment to continue building on that legacy,” the White House statement reads.\n\nThe White House statement noted that Harris affirmed the U.S. “ironclad commitment” to maintain Japan’s national defense and to counter “China’s aggressive and irresponsible provocations in the Taiwan Strait.”\n\nHarris to Lead Regional Mission\n\n\n\nHarris’s visit to Japan comes a week after President Joe Biden said the United States would militarily defend Taiwan from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which rules China as a single-party state.\n\nThe statement outraged the CCP, which maintains a “One China” principle that alleges that Taiwan is a breakaway province of China. The regime has vowed to unite the island with the mainland by any means necessary, and it has repeatedly threatened to use military force to achieve this goal.\n\nTaiwan is a self-governing democracy and has never been controlled by the CCP.\n\nThe United States maintains a “One China” policy, which formally recognizes but doesn’t endorse the CCP’s “One China” principle. Despite having no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, the United States is legally bound to provide the island nation with the arms necessary to defend itself.\n\nAlthough the CCP may claim that Biden’s statement was controversial, Japan has long committed its troops to the defense of Taiwan from a CCP invasion and is working to place special units on an island near Taiwan for that eventuality.\n\nJapan’s Maritime Self-Defense Force submarine and a U.S. Navy destroyer are pictured in their first joint anti-submarine drill in the South China Sea on Nov. 16, 2021. (The Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force)\n\nWhite House aides said Harris would work to build a unified approach with Japan to counter the CCP’s challenges in the region.\n\nTaiwan Conflict Would Be ‘Devastating’\n\nThe Harris–Kishida meeting also comes just days after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with his CCP counterpart, Wang Yi, on the sidelines of a U.N. summit in New York.\n\n“The Secretary made crystal clear that, in accordance with our long-standing one-China policy, which again has not changed, the maintenance of peace and stability across the Strait is absolutely, vitally important,” a White House official said of the meeting.\n\nBlinken expanded on the issue during a Sep. 25 interview on “60 Minutes.”\n\n“China has acted increasingly aggressively when it comes to Taiwan,” Blinken said, according to CBS News. “That poses a threat to peace and stability in the entire region.”\n\nHe also said a conflict between the CCP and Taiwan would be “devastating” and have global ramifications because of the two nations’ vital importance to the global economy, particularly in the production of semiconductor chips.\n\nTo that end, Blinken said the United States was reacting to the CCP’s unilateral effort to change the status quo regarding Taiwan, something that both nations have pledged to not do.\n\n“We had a conversation about our different approaches to Taiwan, and I reiterated what the president has said, and what he’s said clearly and consistently,” Blinken said.\n\n“Our continued adherence to the One China Policy, our determination that the differences [between the CCP and Taiwan] be resolved peacefully, our insistence that peace and stability be maintained in the Taiwan Straits, and our deep concern that China was taking actions to try to change that status quo. That’s what the issue is.”",
    "China says it’s willing to work with Australia to resolve differences": "The Australian government wants China to lift trade sanctions on billions of dollars of Australian exports, including wine, coal, barley and beef. It is also concerned about the welfare of two citizens, journalist Cheng Lei and writer Yang Hengjun, who have been jailed on espionage charges.\n\nIn her maiden speech at the General Assembly, Senator Wong warned against tensions tipping into conflict in the Indo-Pacific, in a reference to China’s growing military assertiveness in the region.\n\nSenator Wong told the assembly that a conflict such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine should not be repeated in this region, which is central to global prosperity and security.\n\nShe also repeated calls from the international community for Beijing to use its “no limits friendship” with Moscow to put pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine, which has upended energy and food markets globally and shows no sign of slowing.\n\n“We cannot accept a situation where large countries determine the fate of smaller countries,” she said.\n\n“That is why Russia’s illegal, immoral invasion of Ukraine cannot be normalised and it cannot be minimised. Russia’s attack on Ukraine is an attack on all smaller countries.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe tone of Mr Wang’s public comments on the Australia-China meeting was more conciliatory than after their first talks in July, where he criticised the former Morrison government for treating China as a threat.\n\nMr Wang said Senator Wong had said Australia hoped the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries would be an opportunity to communicate frankly with China.\n\n‘Very wrong, dangerous signals’\n\n“Australia respects the international legal system based on the UN Charter, adheres to the one-China policy and does not support Taiwan independence,” Mr Wang said.\n\nAustralia’s version of the one-China policy means it acknowledges Beijing’s view that Taiwan is a province of China and does not recognise Taiwan as a sovereign nation, but it does not necessarily support that claim. However, the policy allows for unofficial contact with Taiwan.\n\nChina, meanwhile, accused the United States of sending “very wrong, dangerous signals” on Taiwan after the US Secretary of State told Mr Wang on Friday that the maintenance of peace and stability over Taiwan was vitally important.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaiwan was the focus of the 90-minute, “direct and honest” talks between Antony Blinken and Mr Wang in a flurry of diplomatic activity on the margins of the General Assembly in New York.\n\n“For our part, the secretary made crystal clear that, in accordance with our long-standing one-China policy, which again has not changed, the maintenance of peace and stability across the Strait is absolutely, vitally important,” a senior US administration official told reporters.\n\nChina’s foreign ministry, in a statement on the meeting, said the United States was sending “very wrong, dangerous signals” on Taiwan, and the more rampant Taiwan’s independence activity was, the less likely the chance of a peaceful settlement.\n\n“The Taiwan issue is an internal Chinese matter, and the United States has no right to interfere in what method will be used to resolve it,” the ministry cited Mr Wang as saying.\n\nTensions over Taiwan have soared after a visit there in August by US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, which was followed by large-scale Chinese military drills, as well as a pledge by US President Joe Biden to defend the democratically governed island.\n\nWith Reuters",
    "Fréttablaðið Carries an Article by Chinese Ambassador to Iceland He Rulong Entitled \"Taiwan Has Always Been Part of China\"": "On August 31, the famous Icelandic newspaper Fréttablaðið carried an article by Ambassador He Rulong entitled \"Taiwan Has Always Been Part of China\". The full text is as follows:\n\nIn disregard of China's strong opposition and serious representations, Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi visited China's Taiwan region, triggering a new round of tensions across the Taiwan Strait and throwing the Taiwan question into global spotlight once again. Recently, I have noted that Icelandic media carried some articles on Taiwan, and some of my Icelandic friends had also asked me about my views on the Taiwan question at various events. I therefore feel the need to write this piece to shed some lights on the question of Taiwan with the hope that my Icelandic friends will understand this question in a more objective and comprehensive way.\n\nFirst, Taiwan has belonged to China since ancient times.\n\nThe earliest record of Taiwan is found in Seaboard Geographic Gazetteer compiled in the year 230 by Shen Ying of the State of Wu during the Three Kingdoms Period (220-280). Starting from the Song (960-1279) and Yuan (1270-1368) dynasties, the imperial central governments of China all set up administrative bodies to exercise jurisdiction over Penghu and Taiwan. In 1895, Japan launched a war of aggression against China and began its colonization over Taiwan. After the end of World War II, China regained Taiwan both in law and in fact: in 1943, the governments of China, the United States, the United Kingdom issued the Cairo Declaration. In 1945, China, the United States, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union signed the Potsdam Proclamation, and also in 1945, Japan signed the Japanese Instrument of Surrender. All of these documents stated that all the territories Japan had stolen from China, such as Northeast China, Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, should be restored to China. On October 1, 1949, the People's Republic of China (PRC) was founded, replacing the Republic of China, and the Central People's Government became the only legal government representing the whole of China. As a result of the civil war in China between 1945 and 1949 and the interference of external forces, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have fallen into a state of prolonged political antagonism, but Taiwan's status as part of China's territory has never changed. As an Icelandic friend said on Vísindavefnum, \"Both the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the Kuomintang agree that Taiwan is a province of China, and the debate is actually about which regime has the right to rule China as a whole\".\n\nSecond, the one-China principle has been widely recognized by the international community.\n\nAt its 26th session in October 1971, thanks to the support of most countries including Iceland, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 2758 which spelled out that China has one single seat in the UN, and there is no such thing as \"two Chinas\" or \"one China, one Taiwan\". At the UN, Taiwan is referred to as \"Taiwan, Province of China\". On August 3, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres once again reiterated that the UN's position on the Taiwan question is very clear: The UN abides by Resolution 2758 on the one-China principle adopted in 1971. One principle governing PRC's establishment of diplomatic relations with a foreign country is that it recognizes the government of the PRC as the sole legal government representing the whole of China, and severs or refrains from establishing diplomatic relations with the Taiwan authorities. At present, 181 countries including Iceland have established diplomatic relations with China on the basis of the one-China principle. The Joint Communique on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations Between China and Iceland also clearly stipulates the one-China principle. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Iceland recently reiterated that \"Like the vast majority of countries in the world, Iceland has recognized one and undivided China.\" (Eins og langflest ríki heims hefur Ísland viðurkennt eitt og óskipt Kína.)\n\nThird, who is the real \"saboteur of peace\" in the Taiwan Strait?\n\nSince the Democratic Progressive Party came to power in 2016, it has continued to promote \"incremental independence\", push forward \"de-sinicization\", and sought every means to create \"two Chinas\" and \"one China, one Taiwan\" on various occasions. The United States claims to follow its one-China policy and does not support the \"independence of Taiwan\". But some forces in the United States run counter to the one-China policy in their actual deeds, blatantly insert the so-called \"Taiwan Relations Act\" and the \"Six Assurances\" unilaterally concocted by the US side into the statement of the one-China policy of the United States, and constantly distort, obscure and hollow out the one-China principle. China has always been opposed to this. The witness of the development of US-China Relations, former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said, \"it's essential that the principle of one China be maintained, and the US should not by subterfuge or a gradual process develop something of a two-China solution\". Former Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating said, \"A visit by Pelosi would be unprecedented—foolish, dangerous and unnecessary\". However, on 2 August, in disregard of China's strong opposition and serious representations, Nancy Pelosi visited China's Taiwan region, which seriously violates the commitments made by the US side and infringes upon China's sovereignty. China could not sit idly by and watch, and was forced to take necessary countermeasures.\n\nAn Icelander who once lived in China wrote in his article with Fréttablaðið, \"during years of living in China, I have met so many Chinese with different views on various issues, but nothing unites the Chinese people more than the Taiwan question\". A relative of mine who is over 70 years old told me that he is willing to go to the battlefield if there is a fight for the reunification of the motherland. This reflects a shared commitment of the 1.4 billion Chinese people in resolutely safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity. Pelosi's visit to Taiwan actually served to get the Chinese people more united and determined to realize the reunification of the motherland. A reunited China will bring more opportunities for development to all countries and will create more positive momentum for prosperity and stability in the Asia-Pacific and the wider world.\n\nShould you be interested in the historical ins and outs of the Taiwan question and China's basic policies, please refer to the white paper entitled \"The Taiwan Question and China's Reunification in the New Era\" published by the Chinese government on August 10.",
    "‘We are Chinese’: meet the Taiwanese who want to embrace Beijing rule": "At a Cantonese restaurant in Taipei, Harry Chen and four old friends are shouting at each other over a Lazy Susan, stopping occasionally to toast each other with Scottish whiskey or translate their argument into English.\n\nAll are retired men in their 70s – the sons of Chinese nationalist soldiers – and were born or grew up in Taiwan during its brutal decades of martial law.\n\nThey are the demographic considered most likely to support the “unification” of Taiwan with China. And they do – mostly. But the issue is complicated: Taiwan functions domestically as an entirely independent country, with its own democratically elected government, currency, military and vibrant civil society.\n\nHowever, the Chinese Communist party (CCP) believes it is a province of China that must be “reunified” with the mainland – peacefully by preference, but by force if necessary.\n\nDespite threats and intimidation by Beijing and its military, Taiwan’s resistance to unification only grows stronger. More and more people are also identifying themselves as exclusively Taiwanese, not exclusively Chinese or both. More are showing support for independence.\n\nRetired businessman Harry Chen believes Taiwan is part of China and would be better off if it agreed to be a Chinese province. Photograph: Helen Davidson/The Observer\n\nBut this month a poll in Taiwan found almost 12% of respondents still support unification. Other surveys have shown that figure to be about 5%-10%. The number has declined over the years but a stubborn segment saying yes to “one China” suggests a sizeable group of people in Taiwan are not being pushed towards independence like so many of their compatriots. Some analysts also say this group could be enough to vote hardline pro-China candidates – some of whom also have connections to organised crime - into local government.\n\nGiven the military drills and the threats to Taiwan, and the deteriorating freedoms and rights inside China, it is a fair question to ask why anyone in Taiwan would want to go back to life under authoritarian rule, decades after they left it behind.\n\n“People’s understanding of unification has changed quite a lot over the decades,” said Jeremy Huai-Che Chiang, a Taipei-based analyst.\n\nNowadays, people in Taiwan tend to view the prospect of unification through the prism of Hong Kong. There is little trust for President Xi Jinping’s promises – reiterated in a recent white paper – that they would retain anything close to the freedom and autonomy they have now.\n\nTaiwanese politics is famously combative and starkly divided, operating in an almost equally partisan local media environment. The ruling Democratic Progressive party is accused by China of being secessionist and by critics of exacerbating tensions by courting global support.\n\nThe nationalist Kuomintang (KMT), the main opposition party, has an ageing base and is struggling to regain popularity while staying true to its roots. It has not been helped by a faction that Dafydd Fell, director of the Centre of Taiwan Studies at Soas University of London, said is “taking quite a strong pro-unification line”.\n\nThey are also being outflanked by fringe pro-unification parties, including some linked to the Bamboo Union alleged crime syndicate.\n\nThese fringe groups, often seen protesting or harassing pro-Taiwan delegates and events, have “disproportionate” airtime considering their almost non-existent vote, but they know how to mobilise, and some are mysteriously well-funded, says Fell.\n\nPro-unification people are generally thought to be concentrated among older generations, are probably KMT voters and are typically men. Chiang said there are still some young proponents, including a Chinese nationalist minority, but they are often just “defeatist” and believe Taiwan would lose a conflict and should cut its losses now.\n\nFell outlines other influences on unification supporters, including rising nationalism and CCP propaganda and disinformation. Some supporters are driven by cynicism about divisive Taiwanese party politics and are nostalgic for the strong leadership of the CCP or martial law.There are those who have benefited economically from closer ties with China, and who “are just trying to stay out of politics … and find that kind of PRC nationalism quite annoying”, while some have spent decades in China, the US and Taiwan, and have decided they support and trust the CCP.\n\nChen is at the more hardline end. He said life for everyone would be better if Taiwan just accepted it was a Chinese province and its democratic government peacefully accepted the benefits of China’s economic strength and global power. “What normal people want in life is good living, peace and happiness,” he said. “People who want independence, that’s bullshit – they’re lying to themselves.”\n\nHe spoke of a stability in Taiwan that has disappeared since the 1980s democratisation. He cited the decline of the US, the growing wealth divide and Boris Johnson generally as evidence that western democracy does not work.\n\nMany other factors and variations are also at the Taipei restaurant table. All five men identify as Chinese and believe Taiwan is part of China, citing history, ethnicity, culture and language. Two men, including Chen, are ardent supporters of Xi and the CCP. They welcome a takeover and believe life will be better for all, so Taiwan’s government should just accept it. Another said he would support unification under the CCP but not while Xi is leader, and is very worried about a Chinese invasion. Another wants unification but not under the CCP, while the fifth doesn’t think much of any option but hates the DPP most of all.\n\nPerhaps for this group of friends, the term “pro-unification” is not as accurate as “anti-independence”.\n\nXi has pledged to annex Taiwan, and the white paper said this could not be left to future generations. Taiwan’s resistance is growing, as is international support for its plight and what annexation might mean for the region. The easiest option is to maintain the status quo, but for everyone at the Taipei dinner table, the idea that Beijing could ever just decide to back off and let Taiwan be is unfathomable. “Impossible,” Chen said. “This is the mission of the Chinese. Why would they change?”\n\nAdditional reporting by Chi Hui Lin",
    "Blinken Calls for ‘Peace and Stability’ With Taiwan in Meeting With CCP Counterpart": "US Secretary of State Antony Blinken meets Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi during a meeting in Nusa Dua, Bali, Indonesia July 9, 2022. (Stefani Reynolds/Pool via Reuters)\n\nBlinken Calls for ‘Peace and Stability’ With Taiwan in Meeting With CCP Counterpart\n\nSenior diplomats from the United States and China met on Sep. 23 on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York City.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi shook hands but did not respond to questions from the media as they sat down for talks.\n\nBlinken told Wang that the maintenance of peace and stability on the issue of Taiwan was vital to the relationship between the two nations.\n\nA senior U.S. official told reporters that Taiwan was the focus of the meeting.\n\n“For our part, the Secretary made crystal clear, that in accordance with our long-standing one-China policy, which again has not changed, the maintenance of peace and stability across the Strait is absolutely, vitally important,” the official said.\n\nThe meeting took place despite a truncating of Blinken’s schedule, following the announcement that his father, Donald, had died the night before at the age of 96.\n\nIt also followed an exceptionally contentious week in Sino-American relations following the release of a “60 Minutes” interview in which President Joe Biden stated that U.S. forces would defend Taiwan from an invasion by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).\n\nTaiwan in Focus\n\nThe CCP, which rules China as a single-party state, claims that Taiwan is a breakaway province of China that must be united with the mainland. Its leadership has repeatedly said that it is willing to use military force to achieve this goal, and has previously threatened to start a war over the issue.\n\nTaiwan has been a self-governing democracy since 1949, however, and has never been controlled by the CCP.\n\nFormally, the United States recognizes, but does not endorse, the CCP’s position, and the two sides have long agreed that neither side should attempt to unilaterally change the status quo.\n\nConcerning the issue of whether the United States would defend Taiwan from a unilateral attempt from China, the nation has historically adhered to a policy of so-called “strategic ambiguity,” in which it neither confirms nor denies whether it would intervene militarily.\n\nBiden’s recent comments, the fourth such occasion on which the president said the United States would defend Taiwan from CCP aggression, appear to go against that doctrine. The White House has stated repeatedly, however, that there is no change to the United States’ commitment not to unilaterally change the status quo.\n\nPrior to the meeting, the State Department released a statement saying that Blinken’s meeting with Wang was part of Washington’s ongoing efforts to “maintain open lines of communication and manage competition responsibly.”\n\nWhen Wang addressed the U.N. with a speech earlier in the day, however, he accused the United States of provoking China into an “all-out confrontation” and compared Taiwan’s independence to a “gray rhino charging toward us that must be stopped resolutely.”\n\nU.S. leadership appeared unphased by the commentary and, immediately before his meeting with Wang, Blinken met his counterparts from the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, an international strategic forum consisting of the United States, Australia, India, and Japan.\n\nLikewise, Blinken met with leaders of the Partners in the Blue Pacific, an economic and diplomatic working group for Pacific Island nations that Chinese state-owned media has accused of being an American anti-China “clique.”\n\n“We’re deeply committed to the Pacific and have built enduring partnerships here,” Blinken said at a meeting of the Partners earlier in the day.\n\n“All of us have longstanding historical, geographical, and cultural connections to the Pacific and ties between our peoples that go back quite literally generations.”\n\nReuters contributed to this report",
    "Australia refused to endorse China’s claim to Taiwan in 1972 because it foresaw a time like this": "Journalists and policy analysts should spend more time reading history. If they did, they would be better placed to challenge the diplomats and politicians who casually requisition the past in order to lay claim to the present.\n\nWe might also find our way towards policy prescriptions with real meat, as opposed to the all-too-common superficialities that substitute true engagement with historical context for little more than a doff and a wink at times gone by. Wisdom is in the files.\n\nCertainly, when it comes to Australia’s relationship with China today, Cold War history seems more relevant than ever. That history is being used to insist on policy positions that are (allegedly) obligatory or self-evidently in our self-interest. Such claims cannot be properly scrutinised without close examination of the primary sources. And, funnily enough, when we do so, we find conspicuous and useful parallels with the broader strategic quandary in which Australia finds itself during the 2020s.\n\nIn his recent address to the National Press Club, China’s ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, drew some familiar lines in the sand about his government’s position on the status of Taiwan: the island was, he said, ‘a province of China’ and Australia should ‘take the one-China principle seriously’ if it hoped to have a half-decent relationship with its northern giant. Quoting the joint communiqué of December 1972 that had established diplomatic relations between Australia and China, he insisted that Australia had formally acceded to Beijing’s position on Taiwan—and that Prime Minister Anthony Albanese’s government simply had to do the honourable (and wise) thing, and fall into step with successive Australian governments that had stood by the original agreement. No one at the Press Club questioned the ambassador about his interpretation.\n\nBut did Australia, in fact, endorse the claim that Taiwan is an integral part of Chinese territory when it shook hands with China 50 years ago?\n\nAs usual, some of Beijing’s Australian groupies rushed to play the game of stacks-on that happens every time China lectures its southern minnow on its dangerous temerity. Former diplomat Gregory Clark has written that China’s ‘taking over Taiwan [is] a right granted by every nation recognising Beijing, including the US and Australia’. Others have asserted that the 1972 agreement merely acknowledged China’s stance on Taiwan, but did not agree to it, and have appealed to the wording of the communiqué, but gone no further. (The pertinent sentence reads: ‘The Australian Government recognises the Government of the People’s Republic of China as the sole legal government of China [and] acknowledges the position of the Chinese Government that Taiwan is a province of the People’s Republic of China..)\n\nFormerly classified Australian documents—reproduced in an official documents volume of 2002 commemorating the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations—show clearly that Australia refused to sign a document endorsing China’s claim to Taiwan, and that it did so quite deliberately. Indeed, the sentence about Taiwan was the subject of considerable haggling and disagreement between the two sides during what was an otherwise amiable negotiating process.\n\nThe documents volume is available online, as it has been for many years (without the useful editorial commentary that appears only in the hardcopy), yet few who talk at length about the bilateral relationship appear to have read it.\n\nThe emergence of differences over Taiwan in late 1972 is all the more striking in view of the public statements made by Gough Whitlam, who was first elected prime minister in November of that year and was in a rush to establish relations with Beijing as part of a helter-skelter program of policy change. In July 1972, for example, he had said: ‘There is only one China. Peking is the capital of one China. Taiwan is a province of one China.’\n\nBut when it came to a formal agreement, he proved more cautious and cagey. The instructions given to the Australian diplomat charged with negotiating the joint communiqué were that he should seek Chinese agreement to a formula in which Australia ‘takes note’ of China’s position that Taiwan was ‘an inalienable part of the territory of the People’s Republic of China’. The Department of Foreign Affairs had explained to Whitlam that the formula was one of ‘several … which various countries have used, all of them falling short of endorsing Peking’s claim to Taiwan’, and was intended to demonstrate that Australia ‘neither challenges nor endorses’ the PRC’s position.\n\nThe Chinese immediately responded with their own proposed text—Australia ‘recognises that Taiwan is a province of China’—which Foreign Affairs had forecast as an ‘extreme position’ that the Chinese were likely to advance in an attempt to take advantage of Whitlam’s desire to establish diplomatic relations forthwith. The department advised him to reject such a ploy because the Chinese would ‘be given the impression that we can be dragooned into accepting Chinese positions’. Other important domestic and foreign policy considerations were also said to be at play—among them, a potential view among Southeast Asian neighbours that Australia was content to be pushed around by China. And then there was United States, which, though seeking rapprochement with China, had made clear to its allies that it viewed approval of the PRC’s claim over Taiwan to be a concession too far.\n\nThe Australian negotiator therefore refused categorically to accept the Beijing’s formula, telling his Chinese counterpart, ‘Australia should not be asked … to accept explicitly the Chinese position … Some middle ground had to be found.’ There was, he remarked, ‘no further compromise to propose’ on the question of an outright endorsement—a statement that proved ‘sufficient to draw from the Chinese Ambassador a further proposal’ on Taiwan, in a form of words that eventually found its way into the final communiqué.\n\nEven so, the Australians tried hard to push the Chinese back to the earlier formula (‘takes note’), arguing, with Whitlam’s approval, that Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai had agreed to such wording when Whitlam had discussed the matter with him as leader of the opposition during a visit to China in July 1971.\n\nThis time, it was the Chinese who dug in their heels. The Chinese envoy agreed that such a formula had been discussed, but denied that Zhou had approved it—and later insisted that there could be no compromise on Australia’s ‘acknowledging’ the position of China in relation to Taiwan. When asked why, he retorted that there were ‘many such reasons but he had no authority to reveal them’.\n\nThe reasons seem to have been precisely those that have animated Ambassador Xiao. The Chinese hoped to hold on to a modicum of ambiguity in order to be able to claim that Australia had recognised Taiwan to be part of China. According to Foreign Affairs, ‘the Chinese characters used for “acknowledging” are the same as those used elsewhere in the communique for “recognising”’. In other words, the interchangeability of the two words conferred on the Taiwan sentence a whiff of Australian endorsement, given that the communiqué also referred to Australia’s recognition of the PRC government as the sole legal government China.\n\nBut the Australians were quick to explain to other governments how they viewed the agreement. Whitlam signed off on a message that was intended to show ‘that we stood up to China on the Taiwan issue and achieved a satisfactory result’. Nine governments—most of them in Asia—were told that the ‘principal point at issue’ during negotiations was the status of Taiwan, and Australia had ‘argued hard’ for the ‘takes note’ formula, but was satisfied with the final result because ‘“Acknowledges” is very similar to “takes note”’.\n\nThe intensity of Australia’s wrangling over one sentence of the communiqué raises the question of why such strenuous efforts were made over a minor element of a much larger relationship. Aside from a general desire to resist Chinese bullying, what were the strategic concerns that informed Australia’s determination to neither challenge nor endorse Beijing over Taiwan?\n\nIn their first and most wide-ranging submission to Whitlam on the matter, Foreign Affairs officials tried to cast their minds forward to a day when great-power conflict over Taiwan might place Australia in an unenviable position:\n\n[C]omplete Governmental endorsement of Peking’s claim in a formal communique … would make it very difficult for Australia to protest against any future move by Peking—unlikely as this seems at present—to recover by force of arms an island we had recognised as being part of China’s sovereign territory. Equally, such endorsement would make it very difficult to find a ground for not condemning any counteraction that might be taken by the United States under its Security Treaty with [Taiwan].\n\nXiao and his government have made plain that the threat of force has moved well beyond ‘unlikely’, giving added weight to another concern of Foreign Affairs—namely, that Taiwan’s position was not so different from Australia’s: ‘Unqualified endorsement of Peking’s claim could also give substance to charges that Australia had “abandoned” Taiwan, a country with a population a little larger than our own.’\n\nThe question implied in 1972 seems yet more germane in 2022: if a great power can ride roughshod over others without our raising so much as a whimper, why should we expect anybody to come to our aid in a time of trouble?",
    "PART I: Small island, huge impact - historical facts and truths about Taiwan": "By DAI QINGLI\n\nChinese ambassador to The Bahamas\n\nUS House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s recent visit to Taiwan was provocative, reckless and dangerous. The visit, which was the culmination of misguided US moves to challenge China’s core national interests, left the political foundations of China-US relations shaken and drew an expectedly strong reaction from China.\n\nThe visit also revealed a routine lack of historical knowledge and respect for other people’s feelings among the American political elite.\n\nUnderstanding the history of the Taiwan question, its cardinal importance to the 1.4 billion people in China, and its centrality to the most consequential bilateral relationship in the world today is crucial for deciphering current developments in objective and balanced ways.\n\nWe will now go back in time and examine the origins of the Taiwan question and the one-China principle, trace their evolution in the context of China-U.S. relations and cross-Strait interactions, and assess where the situation is headed in a three-part series in these pages.\n\nOne country, one people\n\nTaiwan is the largest island of China, known as the “treasured island of the motherland”. It lies on the western edge of the Pacific Ocean and faces Fujian Province to the west through the Taiwan Strait, the narrowest point of which is only 80 miles, with some of the outlying islets of Taiwan just a few miles from the coast of Fujian.\n\nThe Taiwan Strait is part of a busy international shipping lane. Almost all the maritime traffic to and from China’s eastern coast and the Sea of Japan pass through it.\n\nThe island covers an area of 36,000 square kilometers, slightly bigger than Belgium and smaller than Switzerland, and has a population of 23 million.\n\nThe people of Taiwan are descended from the same Chinese ancestry and cultural roots as those on the mainland. Ninty-eight percent of Taiwanese are Han Chinese speaking the same language as their brothers and sisters on the mainland, and they speak the dialect of southern Fujian. People across the Taiwan-Strait learn from the same ancient Chinese classics and celebrate the same festivals.\n\nThe mainland is now Taiwan’s largest trading partner, and Taiwan the mainland’s eighth largest trading partner and third largest source of imports. In 2021, according to data by Taiwan, its exports to the mainland accounted for nearly 30% of Taiwan’s total exports, and its investment in the mainland over 30% of its total off-island investment.\n\nMore than 150,000 Taiwan residents live on the mainland today. They increasingly enjoy the same treatments as their mainland compatriots, including having social security accounts. The year 2019 saw 9 million visits made between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.\n\nLost and regained\n\nTaiwan has been part of China since ancient times. A large number of historical records document the development of Taiwan by the Chinese people in earlier periods. One of the earliest references was found in Seaboard Geographic Gazetteer compiled in 230 AD by scholar Shen Ying of the State of Wu.\n\nThe royal court of the Sui Dynasty (581-619 AD) had on three occasions sent troops to Taiwan, called Liuqiu at that time. Since the Song (960-1279 AD) and Yuan (1270-1368 AD) dynasties, the government of China set up administrative bodies to exercise jurisdiction over Taiwan.\n\nIn 1624, Dutch colonialists invaded and occupied the southern part of Taiwan, only to be expelled in 1662 by General Zheng Chenggong who was hailed as a national hero. The Qing court set up the Taiwan prefecture in 1684 under the jurisdiction of Fujian Province to strengthen its control over the island. In 1885, Taiwan’s status was upgraded to be the 20th province of China.\n\nIn 1895, the Qing court, which was defeated by Japan in a maritime war, was forced to cede Taiwan and the Penghu Islands to Japan. Yet the long suffering Taiwan people were never forgotten. While resisting Japanese aggression, leader of the Communist Party of China Chairman Mao Zedong said to American journalist Nym Wales in May 1937 that China’s goal was to “achieve a final victory in the war that would recover the occupied Chinese territories – and secure the liberation of Taiwan”.\n\nIn December 1943, China, the United States and the United Kingdom, as allied powers during WWII, issued the Cairo Declaration which stated that “It was the purpose of the three allies that all the territories Japan had stolen from China, such as Northeast China, Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, should be restored to China”. The Potsdam Proclamation signed by the three countries in July 1945 reiterated: “The terms of the Cairo Declaration shall be carried out.”\n\nIn September of the same year, Japan signed the instrument of surrender. In October the Chinese government announced that it was resuming the exercise of sovereignty over Taiwan, and the ceremony to accept Japan’s surrender in Taiwan Province of the China war theater of the allied powers was held in Taibei (Taipei).\n\nFrom that day on, China had recovered Taiwan de jure and de facto.\n\nOn October 1, 1949, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) was founded, becoming the successor to the Republic of China (ROC, 1912-1949). As a natural result, the government of the PRC should enjoy and exercise China’s full sovereignty, which includes its sovereignty over Taiwan.\n\nDespite the protracted political stand-off across the Taiwan Strait, the sovereignty and territory of China have never been divided, and Taiwan’s status as part of China’s territory has never changed.\n\nSeparation\n\nTaiwan became an issue as the result of China’s civil war and foreign interference.\n\nDuring the war of resistance against Japanese aggression (1931-1945), the Communist Party of China formed a united front with the then ruling Party the Kuomintang to fight Japanese imperialists. After victory over Japan, the Kuomintang headed by Chiang Kai-shek, turned their guns on the Communists and launched an all-out civil war.\n\nChiang thought victory was in the bag, as his army was more than three times bigger than the Communists’ and he had American backing of money, weapons and advisers. Yet his regime had long lost the support of the Chinese people due to its utter corruption and ineptitude. The government of the “Republic of China” in Nanjing was thus overthrown and the People’s Republic of China was proclaimed in October 1949.\n\nChiang retreated to Taiwan and created the division across the Taiwan Strait that has persisted to this day.\n\nThe US adopted a policy of isolation and containment of the newly established People’s Republic. When the Korean War broke out in June 1950, President Truman ordered the Seventh Fleet into the Taiwan Strait and the U.S. 13th Air Force to set up base in Taiwan. In December 1954 the U.S. further concluded with the Taiwan authorities a so-called mutual defense treaty placing China’s Taiwan under U.S. “protection”. Henceforth Taiwan became a major issue between China and the United States.\n\nBelated justice\n\nAlthough overthrown by the Chinese people and having retreated to Taiwan, the Kuomintang regime has continued to use the designation “Republic of China” and to occupy China’s seat at the United Nations due to the US hostile policy toward New China.\n\nThe Government of the PRC worked tenaciously for many years to build international support for the resumption of its lawful seat at the UN. Finally, at its 26th Session in October 1971, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 2758, which undertook “to restore all its rights to the People’s Republic of China and to recognise the representatives of its Government as the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations, and to expel forthwith the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek from the place which they unlawfully occupy at the United Nations and in all the organisations related to it”.\n\nThis resolution settled once and for all the political, legal and procedural issues of China’s representation in the UN, which covered the whole country, including Taiwan. It also spelled out that China has one single seat in the UN, so there is no such thing as “two Chinas” or “one China, one Taiwan”.\n\nOne China only\n\nOn the day of its founding, the government of the PRC declared to all countries in the world, “This government is the sole legitimate government representing the entire people of the People’s Republic of China. It is ready to establish diplomatic relations with all foreign governments that are willing to abide by the principles of equality, mutual benefit and mutual respect for each other’s territorial integrity and sovereignty.”\n\nTo this day, all China’s diplomatic relationships have been predicated on the recognition of the government of the PRC as the sole legal government representing the whole of China, and on severing or refraining from establishing diplomatic relations with the Taiwan authorities.\n\nUp to now, 181 countries have established diplomatic relations with the PRC on the basis of the one-China principle and they handle relations with Taiwan within the one- China framework, whereby only unofficial economic and cultural links are maintained.\n\nPelosi’s visit to Taiwan has nothing to do with ideology and everything to do with challenging China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\nTaiwan is central to the Chinese people’s conception of national identity and righting an historical wrong. The Chinese people have had painful memories of their country losing territory to invading imperialist powers in all directions since modern times.\n\nIf there’s one thing that unites the 1.4 billion Chinese people, it is the profound yearning for the reunification of China and the firm resolve to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity. The will of 1.4 billion people should never be taken lightly.",
    "The Right Way for China and the United States to Get Along in the New Era": "Speech by State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi\n\nat Asia Society\n\nNew York, September 22, 2022\n\nPresident Kevin Rudd of the Asia Society,\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nIt is good to be back in New York for the U.N. General Assembly, and meet friends again after an interval of three years.\n\nIn the last few years, a lot has happened in the world. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to wreak havoc; the global economy is in danger of a recession; and the Ukraine crisis has persisted and escalated. Issues involving food, energy, industrial and supply chains and climate change have become more acute.\n\nThe past few years have seen China-U.S. relations at a low ebb since the establishment of diplomatic ties. The reality of China-U.S. interdependence is ignored; the history of our win-win cooperation is misrepresented; channels of dialogue and communication are blocked. And the bilateral relationship is being defined and impacted dangerously by so-called strategic competition. This is bringing tremendous uncertainty to the future of our peoples and to countries across the world.\n\nIt is widely held that China-U.S. relations have well exceeded the bilateral scope and carry implications for the whole world. The global community expects China and the U.S. to take the lead, fulfill the responsibility as major countries, keep the bilateral ties stable and advance global cooperation.\n\nSince last year, President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden have had several rounds of strategic communication in flexible ways. President Xi pointed out that whether China and the U.S. can handle their relationship well bears on the future of the world. It is a question of the century to which the two countries must provide a good answer. President Biden said that the U.S.-China relationship is the most consequential relationship in the world, and how this relationship develops will shape the world in the 21st century.\n\nBoth Presidents agree that they should make the China-U.S. relationship work and not mess it up. They both believe the two countries should steer clear of conflict and confrontation. And they both stand for closer bilateral exchanges and cooperation. President Biden stressed many times that the U.S. does not seek a new Cold War with China; it does not aim to change China’s system; the revitalization of its alliances is not against China; the U.S. does not support “Taiwan independence”; and it is not looking for conflict with China. People around the world hope that these important statements are translated into real actions.\n\nIf two fine orchestras are to work together harmoniously, their conductors must first set the same tone, and all the players must follow the same music score. However, what has happened is that the U.S. team seems to have two different sets of music score. Their leader’s political will of a stable bilateral relationship has yet to be translated into logical policies. The Chinese people and people from other countries find this confusing, and would naturally raise questions:\n\nHow will the U.S. deliver on its promise of not aiming to change China’s system, when it has framed a false narrative of “democracy versus authoritarianism”, a narrative that deliberately amplifies an ideological confrontation with China and takes aim at China’s political system, development path and governing party?\n\nHow can a new Cold War be prevented, when the U.S. has, identifying China as the primary rival and the most serious long-term challenge, engaged in all-round containment, sought to encircle China by shaping the strategic environment around it, pressed other countries to pick sides and formed various small circles that exclude China?\n\nHow will the U.S. honor its important statement of not supporting “Taiwan independence” when it has, regardless of China’s strong opposition, allowed its House Speaker to visit Taiwan again after 25 years, kept elevating substantive relations with Taiwan by repeated official exchanges and arms sales including many offensive weapons, and is advancing the deliberation of the “Taiwan Policy Act” that threatens the very foundation of China-U.S. relations underpinned by the three Joint Communiqués?\n\nAnd how to keep the industrial and supply chains between China and the U.S. and of the world stable, when the U.S. prolongs the trade war with China, keeping in place the extra tariffs on US$360 billion of Chinese goods though ruled inconsistent with the WTO rules, and extending the list of Chinese companies under its sanctions to over 1,000 entities and individuals?\n\nThe United States has, on the one hand, made repeated provocations on issues involving China’s core interests and development rights and interests, yet on the other, expressed a desire to keep the bilateral ties stable and prevent conflict and confrontation. This is self-contradictory in both logic and reality.\n\nWhat is the crux of the matter? It boils down to how the United States perceives China, the world and itself. Be it full confrontation or strategic competition, both have deviated from the right course of China-U.S. relations.\n\nSuch deviations are dangerous and come at a high price. Mr. Kevin Rudd described the current China-U.S. relations as in a workshop with exposed wires and cables lying everywhere, water on the floor and sparks flying. Mr. Joseph Nye compared the relations to a sleepwalking syndrome that could stumble into a new Cold War. Should the United States handle its relations with China with a zero-sum mindset and continue to let “political correctness” misguide its China policy, it won’t find solutions to its own problems, but lead China-U.S. relations to conflict and confrontation. The message we must send, loud and clear, is that now is the time to make serious reflections and get back onto the right track!\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThis year marks the 50th anniversary of President Richard Nixon’s visit to China and the 40th anniversary of the August 17 Communiqué. History matters. It made things the way they are today, and helps shape a better future when its value is appreciated.\n\nA few days earlier I paid a visit to Dr. Kissinger. We reviewed how, with twists and turns, China and the U.S. came to common understanding 50 years ago and the wisdom reflected in that episode of history. Since day one of their engagement, China and the United States have been aware that each is dealing with a country very different from oneself. Yet, these differences were no obstacles to us breaking the ice and establishing diplomatic ties, no obstacles to us deepening cooperation based on common interests, still less to us making joint contributions to world peace and prosperity.\n\nLooking ahead to the next fifty years, the sound and stable growth of China-U.S. relations still depends on whether we could put these differences in perspective and, on this basis, get on to pursue our respective and common interests.\n\nRegarding the right way for China and the U.S. to get on with each other, President Xi Jinping has given a clear answer. That is mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation. These three principles are an important conclusion informed by the evolution of China-U.S. relations over the past 50-odd years. They are also the right way for major countries to live with each other in this era.\n\nLet me first talk about mutual respect.\n\nWithout respect, no trust can be built. Without trust, conflict would be a real danger and actual cooperation could not happen. This is an important lesson drawn from past exchanges between our two countries, and also a basic prerequisite for the bilateral ties to return to the right track.\n\nIn the Shanghai Communiqué issued 50 years ago, the two sides agreed that countries, regardless of their social systems, should conduct their relations on the principles of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states, non-aggression against other states, and non-interference in the internal affairs of other states. Fifty years on, this guiding principle is all the more relevant. We now can see clearly that China will not become another United States, and the U.S. cannot mould China to its liking. Neither side is able to take the other down. This means we need to respect each other’s choices.\n\nDefining one’s own choice as democratic and the other’s as authoritarian, and seeing success as changing the other side in one’s own image are neither consistent with the facts, nor realistic.\n\nChina respects the development path chosen by the American people. We welcome an open and confident United States that enjoys growth and progress. The U.S. should also respect Chinese people’s choice of development path, i.e. socialism with Chinese characteristics.\n\nThis path is tried and tested by the Chinese people with a clear logic of history. In modern times, the Chinese people explored relentlessly for a path to save and revitalize the nation. Various models including Western systems were put into practice, but none of them worked when they failed to fit China’s realities. By adapting Marxism to the Chinese conditions and to the traditional Chinese culture, the Communist Party of China (CPC) successfully rallied the Chinese people and led them in a united endeavor to gain national independence and liberation. Eventually, China found a right path toward prosperity and strength.\n\nThis path has opened up bright prospects for China’s modernization. We have built a moderately prosperous society in all respects, eradicated absolute poverty for the first time in the country’s history, and in a span of a few decades, transformed China from a poor and weak nation into the world’s second largest economy. China has fed nearly 20 percent of the world’s population with nine percent of its arable land. It now has a middle-income group that exceeds 400 million. The 1.4 billion Chinese people moving toward modernization and common prosperity will make a miracle come true in the history of development.\n\nThis path has brought true human rights and democracy to the Chinese people. The world’s largest social security network and compulsory education system have been set up. People’s all-round development is put front and center, and everyone stands a chance to reach one’s full potential. By integrating electoral democracy with consultative democracy, and procedural democracy with substantive democracy, we have advanced a whole-process people’s democracy that has won the people’s full support. Leading U.S. opinion polls show that the Chinese people’s approval rate of their government has stayed above 90 percent for several years running.\n\nThat said, we are clear-eyed that much remains to be done in China’s development. China’s per capita GDP has just exceeded US$12,000, and trails 60-plus countries. It ranks below the 70th place on the Human Development Index. These require that we stay focused on our primary task—making development more balanced and adequate and meeting the people’s higher expectation for a better life. While relying on our own efforts in developing the country and the nation, we are also ready to pursue cooperation of mutual benefit with the U.S. and other countries, to foster a favorable external environment for China’s development.\n\nThe Chinese people, with a time-honored civilization of 5,000 years, are confident and self-reliant, and humble and inclusive. China will unswervingly follow its chosen path and direction, and will forge ahead steadily along this path toward greater success. China will continue to draw upon the valuable experience of other countries and achievements of all civilizations, embrace the world with open arms and open its door even wider.\n\nSome worry that China will export its ideology and threaten the values of other countries. This is completely unnecessary. China has no history of preaching to or lecturing others, and has no intention to export its system or path today. As early as 2,500 years ago, by observing the inclusiveness reflected in the laws of the universe and nature, Chinese philosophers came to the conclusion that “Just as all living things grow in harmony without hurting one another, different ways may run forward without interfering with one another.” Living in our times, we should approach differences with a greater largeness of heart than our ancestors, accept differences with an attitude of mutual respect, and actively pursue the state of harmony without uniformity.\n\nNow let me move on to peaceful coexistence.\n\nPartner or rival? Cooperation or confrontation? These are questions of fundamental importance in China-U.S. relations, and no catastrophic mistakes could be made. To hold the bottom line of peace, we must make the right choice.\n\nI wish to tell you clearly that China chooses peace and commits to peaceful development. Our most basic expectation for China-U.S. relations is for the two countries to live with each other in peace.\n\nAs China develops, some people start to project China as a hypothetical enemy, and the so-called “threat inflation” ensues. This is typical excessive anxiety and is completely unnecessary.\n\nExpansion, coercion and hegemony are never in the veins of the Chinese people. On the contrary, the Chinese believe in the ancient wisdom that “a warlike state will eventually perish”, and “a hegemonic state is doomed to fail.”\n\nSix hundred years ago, navigator Zheng He of China’s Ming Dynasty led the most powerful fleets of his times on seven expeditions across continents, earlier than Columbus’ discovery of the new continent. Yet instead of engaging in colonization, killing or robbing, the Chinese brought tea, silk and porcelain.\n\nI once visited a history museum in Istanbul, a meeting place of Western and Eastern cultures. An exhibition hall on the left displayed relics from Turkey’s exchanges with China, mostly silk and porcelain, whereas a room on the right showcased antiques from its exchanges with the West, mainly swords, guns and armor. These exhibitions speak to vastly different stories in history. Equating the ability to develop with an intention for expansion, or predicting China based on the beaten path of traditional powers will both result in serious misjudgment.\n\nToday’s China is built on the heritage of ancient China. For 70-plus years since the founding of the People’s Republic, China has never provoked a conflict, occupied one inch of foreign soil, started a proxy war, or joined any military bloc. China has the best peace record among the world’s major countries. The CPC, China’s governing party, has incorporated peaceful development into its constitution, and China is the only major country that has codified peaceful development in the Constitution. China is committed to not seeking hegemony, expansion, coercion or sphere of influence, and it wants to live in peace with all other countries. This is undoubtedly a big contribution to global strategic stability.\n\nFor China and the U.S. to coexist in peace, we must follow the rules that both sides subscribe to. Bilaterally, they should be the three China-U.S. Joint Communiqués and the important common understandings reached between leaders of the two countries, rather than imposing one’s domestic law on the other. At the international level, they should be the basic norms governing international relations based on the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter — the rules and order established with the tremendous cost borne by the world anti-fascist alliance and the enormous sacrifice made by the over 35 million Chinese casualties. As a founding member of the U.N. and the first country to sign the U.N. Charter, China has no reason, still less the need, to reinvent the wheel. China and the United States have a responsibility to jointly uphold the order and rules. If the United States’ repeated reference to a “rules-based international order” means the above-mentioned rules, China has no objection. But if it means something else on which no broad-based international consensus exists, then the U.S. has no right to impose it on others.\n\nThe biggest obstacle to peaceful coexistence between China and the United States is the Cold War mentality. Just as colonialism faded out in the 20th century, the Cold War mentality has long become an anachronism in the 21st century. Some in the U.S. try to take China down by repeating the containment tactic used on the former Soviet Union, and hope to encircle China through geopolitical maneuvering like the Indo-Pacific strategy. Such attempts will only prove futile, because China is not the former Soviet Union, and the world is not what it used to be. Only after waking up from the Cold-War dream can one view and handle China-U.S. relations in a cool-headed, rational and realistic way.\n\nThird, on win-win cooperation.\n\nNo cooperation can be based on a win-lose format. Win-win cooperation is not only possible, but also a must. This is the true narrative of China-U.S. relations in the past half a century, and it should remain the goal we both pursue.\n\nNo two major countries have closer people-to-people contacts or more interconnected interests than China and the U.S. do. Before COVID-19 struck, there were more than 300 flights between our two countries every week and over five million mutual visits every year. We once had more than 100 dialogue and exchange mechanisms, 50 pairs of sister provinces/states, and 234 sister city relationships. Despite the pandemic and additional U.S. tariffs on Chinese exports, two-way trade last year topped US$750 billion, up by 28.7 percent year on year, and two-way investment reached US$240 billion. Sixty-six percent of American businesses in China reported plans to invest more in China. During this trip, I met with the representatives of the U.S. business community. They shared the view that China-U.S. cooperation has benefited people in both countries and the world and hoped to achieve greater growth in the Chinese market. These solid facts and figures fully demonstrate that the Chinese and American people want cooperation and our cooperation is driven by win-win outcomes.\n\nFor some time now, a few Americans have been saying that win-win cooperation is only a political slogan. We cannot agree with this. As the world’s largest developing and developed countries, China and the United States have a lot to offer each other. We enjoy broad room for cooperation in a wide range of areas covering economy and trade, energy, science and technology, education, and people-to-people and cultural exchanges. We shoulder important responsibilities in addressing global issues like COVID-19, economic recovery, climate change, terrorism, proliferation and regional hotspots. We have also worked together and accomplished big things for the good of the world, including combating terrorism, tackling financial crises, fighting Ebola, and pushing for the Paris Agreement on climate change. An unfailing truth in China-U.S. interactions is that we both stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation. Cooperation is our best choice.\n\nUndeniably, China and the U.S. have competition in areas like economy and trade, and China does not fear such competition. However, we do not agree that China-U.S. relations should be simply defined by competition, because this is not the entirety or the mainstream of this relationship. At the same time, competition should have boundaries and, more importantly, be fair play. It should be conducted in compliance with widely recognized rules, and not be fixated on undercutting the development capability of others and denying them the legitimate rights and interests. We need healthy competition that brings out the best in each other, not vicious competition that aims at each other’s demise.\n\nOne case in point here is what happened to the Chinese company Huawei. Huawei is a 100 percent private enterprise, yet the U.S. has deployed government resources to suppress it around the world, and even warned countries not to use Huawei equipment or face consequences. This is clearly not fair competition. Ideology driven, the U.S. has overstretched the concept of national security, built “small yard, high fence”, clamored for decoupling and cutting supply chains, pushed for “friend-shoring”, conceived the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, and formed the Chip 4 Alliance. This is clearly not healthy competition. Such moves are not helpful to the U.S.’ own development. They will also disrupt global economic cooperation.\n\nChina has developed itself in the course of reform, opening up and integration into the world. China will not and cannot decouple from the rest of the world. In pursuing high quality development and fostering a new development paradigm, China needs closer connections with the world. By shortening its negative list on foreign investment and creating a more enabling business environment, China is providing its global partners with vast cooperation opportunities. And China welcomes greater success of American businesses in the Chinese market.\n\nBased on equality and respect, China is willing to have more and better cooperation with the United States. Secretary of State Antony Blinken proposed, in his China policy speech, six areas for U.S.-China cooperation. In my meeting with Secretary Blinken in Bali, I also produced a list for our cooperation in eight areas. Together, we can make the list of cooperation longer and the pie of cooperation bigger. The Belt and Road Initiative, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, and other public goods proposed by China are open to all parties, including the United States, and China also stands ready for discussions on U.S. initiatives, to bring about win-win outcomes for our two countries and the world at large.\n\nFor cooperation to be win-win, there needs to be necessary conditions and atmosphere. It won’t do if the U.S. undermines China’s core interests and the foundation for bilateral cooperation on the one hand, and on the other, expects China to cooperate unconditionally. Such logic simply doesn’t work. Meanwhile, I wish to emphasize that no matter how China-U.S. relations may evolve, China, as a responsible major country, will remain actively engaged in addressing the many global challenges, fulfill its responsibilities, and make its contribution. We hope the U.S. will do the same.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThe Taiwan question is at the heart of China’s core interests; the one-China principle is the cornerstone of the political foundation for China-U.S. relations; the three China-U.S. Joint Communiqués are the most crucial “guardrails” for our relations. As things stand, the Taiwan question is growing into the biggest risk in China-U.S. relations. Should it be mishandled, it is most likely to devastate our bilateral ties.\n\nBefore any discussion of the Taiwan question, the premise should be made clear: Taiwan is a part of China’s territory; it has never been a country. Effective administrative jurisdiction of Taiwan by the Chinese government dates back hundreds of years. In 1895, Japan launched an invasion against China and forced the then Qing government to cede control of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands (also known as Pescadores Islands). It was an episode of humiliation in the history of the Chinese nation; yet the Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait never ceased their struggle against aggression and separation.\n\nIn 1943, the governments of China, the United States and the United Kingdom issued the Cairo Declaration, which stated in explicit terms that all the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese, such as Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, shall be restored to China. The 1945 Potsdam Declaration signed by the three countries reiterated that “the terms of the Cairo Declaration shall be carried out”. When Japan signed the Instrument of Surrender in September later that year, it pledged to “carry out the provisions of the Potsdam Declaration in good faith”. The aforementioned legally-binding international instruments have fully restored Taiwan to China, both de jure and de facto.\n\nIt is evident that one-China has become part of the post-war international order, and the one-China principle, a universally recognized basic norm of international relations. The U.N. General Assembly Resolution 2758 adopted in 1971 not only resolved once and for all the representation of the whole of China, Taiwan included, within the United Nations, but also eliminated any room for creating “two Chinas” or “one China, one Taiwan” in the international community. Over the past five decades, the U.N. has always referred to Taiwan as “Taiwan, Province of China”: this is Taiwan’s only status in international law. Recognizing and adhering to one-China is also the political prerequisite for all the 181 countries in establishing diplomatic ties with China.\n\nThe U.S. also made unequivocal commitment of recognizing Taiwan as part of China. It is stated in black and white in the 1972 Shanghai Communiqué, the 1978 Communiqué on the establishment of diplomatic relations, and the August 17 Communiqué of 1982, that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China, and the Government of the People’s Republic of China is the sole legal Government of China. Successive U.S. administrations have clearly reaffirmed their commitment to the one-China policy and several U.S. Presidents have stated their opposition to Taiwan “independence”. All these have been kept on record.\n\nHowever, not long after China and the U.S. established diplomatic ties, the U.S. side went back on its word and passed the Taiwan Relations Act, followed by the so-called internal “Six Assurances”, constantly fudging and hollowing out the one-China principle. Both were unilateral moves by the U.S. side. They run counter to the three China-U.S. Joint Communiqués. Hence, they are null and void from the very beginning, and the Chinese government has all along made clear its opposition.\n\nJust as the U.S. will not allow Hawaii to be split away, China has the right to uphold the unification of the country as Taiwan is part of China. Since the Government of the People’s Republic of China is recognized as the sole legal government representing the whole of China, Taiwan should not be allowed to join any international organization with sovereign implications. If one recognizes the one-China principle, one should not engage in any official interactions with Taiwan. The logic here cannot be simpler.\n\nRecently the U.S. has repeatedly referred to the “status quo in the Taiwan Strait”, and even accused China of “changing the status quo”. This is the very opposite of truth. To be frank, it is with U.S. interference and connivance that “Taiwan independence” forces have grown and expanded. They have kept making changes to the fundamental status quo that both sides of the Strait belong to one and the same China, and hence pose the biggest threat to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities have jettisoned the 1992 Consensus which embodies the one-China principle, undermined the hard-earned prospect of peaceful development of cross-Strait relations, and been bent on pursuing “incremental independence”. They have publicly called for Taiwan independence in the party platform, dished out a new “two states theory”, pressed for “de-sinicization” on the island, and stoked antagonism and obstructed exchanges across the Strait. “Taiwan independence”, like a highly destructive “gray rhino” charging toward us, must be resolutely stopped.\n\nOf all the major countries in the world, China is the only one that is yet to realize complete reunification. National reunification is the shared wish and aspiration of all the Chinese sons and daughters. It is also clearly stipulated in China’s Constitution. “Peaceful reunification and One country, Two systems” — this fundamental guideline best meets the overall interests of the Chinese nation including the Taiwan compatriots, and represents the most practicable and inclusive solution to addressing the difference in system between the mainland and Taiwan. Such a solution is peaceful, democratic, of goodwill and benefits both sides.\n\nAlthough the two sides of the Taiwan Strait practise different systems, it is not an obstacle to reunification, still less an excuse for secession. We have always worked with the greatest sincerity and effort to pursue peaceful reunification. But, we will never tolerate any activity aimed at secession. We reserve the option of taking all necessary measures. This position is designed to forestall actions that violate the Anti-Secession Law; it in no way targets the fellow Chinese in Taiwan. Checking separatist activities for “Taiwan independence”, upholding territorial integrity and safeguarding peace in the Taiwan Strait is a sacred right that China exercises in accordance with domestic and international law.\n\nThe Taiwan question arose as a result of weakness and chaos in the nation, and it will be resolved as national rejuvenation becomes a reality. Reunification is the trend of history and the aspiration of the people. The U.S. should choose to stand on the right side of history.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nIn less than a month, the Communist Party of China will convene its 20th National Congress to draw a well-conceived blueprint for China’s development in the next five years and beyond. Since its founding, the CPC has taken happiness of the people and rejuvenation of the nation as its mission, and has also worked to advance progress of humanity and greater good for the world. Keeping to this founding aspiration, we will stand by the common values of humanity of peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, and work with people in all countries to jointly advance the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nPresident Xi Jinping noted that, “The most important event in international relations over the past 50 years was the reopening and development of China-U.S. relations, which has benefited the two countries and the whole world. The most important event in international relations in the coming 50 years will be for China and the U.S. to find the right way to get along.” It is our hope that China and the U.S. will draw on past experience to find inspiration for the present, and gain strength for going forward. Together, let us explore a way to a China-U.S. relationship for the new era and create a better future for both of our countries!\n\nThank you.",
    "Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian’s Regular Press Conference on August 31, 2022": "Han Zheng, Member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, will attend the opening ceremony of the Taiyuan Energy Low Carbon Development Forum 2022 via video link and deliver a keynote speech on September 1.\n\n\n\nPhoenix TV: Principal deputy spokesperson of the US State Department said when answering a question related to the situation across the Taiwan Strait that China has overreacted and has made provocations, whereas the United States’ response has been “measured and responsible”. Do you have any response to this?\n\nZhao Lijian: The context, cause and course of events that led to the current tensions in the Taiwan Strait are crystal clear. The US made the provocation first, and China was compelled to take legitimate countermeasures, which are justified, lawful, necessary and proportionate. It is the US that breached its one-China commitment and undermined China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, yet it accused China of overreacting. It is the US that has frequently sent warships to flex muscles in waters off China’s coast in the name of freedom of navigation, yet it accused China of making provocations. This is confounding right with wrong. China will not accept it, nor will the international community endorse it.\n\nWhat the US needs to do is to stop fudging, hollowing out and distorting the one-China principle, abide by the basic norms in international relations including respecting other countries’ sovereignty and territorial integrity and non-interference in their internal affairs, and return to the three China-US joint communiqués and the one-China principle, instead of shifting responsibilities, blaming the innocent party and attempting to create an even bigger crisis.\n\nMASTV: NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said a few days ago during a visit to Canada that Russia and China’s cooperation in the Arctic is not consistent with NATO members’ interests and that NATO will expand presence in the region. Russian presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov said that Russia considers Stoltenberg’s words on the necessity of NATO’s expanded presence in the Arctic as its intention to confront Russia in this region. What’s your comment?\n\n\n\nZhao Lijian: The words of Mr. Peskov are well put. NATO’s wanton assertion that China-Russia cooperation challenges NATO values and interests once again exposes its attempt to export the Cold War mentality and replicate bloc confrontation. NATO needs to immediately discard its dangerous thinking and approach that could destabilize the world.\n\nThe natural conditions of the Arctic and their changes have a direct impact on China’s natural environment and Chinese people’s work and life. China is closely involved in the trans-regional and global issues in the Arctic such as environmental protection, climate change and sustainable development. This is an undeniable geographical, natural and social reality. China respects the sovereignty, sovereign rights, and jurisdiction of the Arctic States in this region, and actively conducts international cooperation with various parties to protect the environment and promote sustainable development in the Arctic guided by the basic principles of “respect, cooperation, win-win result and sustainability”.\n\nThe Paper: According to reports, famous Japanese entrepreneur and founder of Kyocera Kazuo Inamori passed away in Kyoto on August 24. Mr. Inamori visited China many times and also enjoyed great popularity in China. What is China’s comment on his passing?\n\n\n\nZhao Lijian: The Chinese side mourns for the passing of Mr. Kazuo Inamori and expresses condolences to his family. Mr. Kazuo Inamori was a world-renowned entrepreneur. He made positive contribution to Japan’s economic, scientific and cultural advancement, and the friendly exchange and cooperation between China and Japan. China and Japan share close contact and deeply entwined interests in various areas. We hope all sectors of the two sides can work together, continuously deepen exchange and cooperation, and promote sound and steady development of China-Japan relations.\n\nCCTV: We have learned that Ambassador Xu Jinghu, Special Representative of the Chinese Government on African Affairs, will be leaving office. Who will be assuming the post?\n\n\n\nZhao Lijian: The Chinese government has appointed Ambassador Liu Yuxi to succeed Ambassador Xu Jinghu as the Special Representative of the Chinese Government on African Affairs.\n\nDuring her time in office, Ambassador Xu Jinghu worked diligently to promote China-Africa friendship and practical cooperation in various fields, maintained good communication with various parties in the international community on issues concerning Africa, and made important contributions to developing China-Africa relations and deepening understanding of China-Africa cooperation.\n\nAmbassador Liu Yuxi is a veteran diplomat well-versed in African affairs who once served as the Chinese Ambassador to Togo and the Head of Mission of China to the African Union. He stands ready to establish close working relations with various sides, further deepen exchange and cooperation between China and African countries and regional organizations, and make strong efforts to advance peace and development in Africa and deepen China-Africa friendship.\n\nReuters: Former USSR leader Mikhail Gorbachev passed away yesterday prompting a strong reaction on Chinese social media platforms. News of his passing was the most followed issue on Weibo for example. Does the foreign ministry have any comment?\n\n\n\nZhao Lijian: Mr. Mikhail Gorbachev made positive contribution to the normalization of relations between China and the Soviet Union. We mourn his passing and extend our condolences to his family.\n\nPhoenix TV: Malaysia’s former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said recently that China was a “big market” for Malaysia and ASEAN and maintaining that economic relationship was crucial. He said that China’s philosophy was not to occupy nations and urged ASEAN countries to move closer to China and stay away from others' provocation of China. Do you have any comment?\n\n\n\nZhao Lijian: I have noted relevant reports. I also heard that Mr. Mahathir Mohamad had contracted COVID-19. We wish him a speedy recovery.\n\nSince the establishment of dialogue relations over 30 years ago, China-ASEAN relations have stayed ahead in many areas. The two sides have been standing together in solidarity to fight COVID-19. The economic cooperation and trade has thrived. Security cooperation has been making steady progress. Our cooperation has yielded many good outcomes and highlights. China and ASEAN are each other’s largest trading partners. From January to July this year, two-way trade totaled $544.9 billion, up by 13.1% year-on-year, delivering tangible benefits to the two billion people on both sides. China always advocates developing inclusive partnerships not targeting any third party and opposes forcing other countries to pick sides. Countries outside the region should earnestly respect regional countries’ interests and desire and make the Asia-Pacific a large arena for mutually-beneficial cooperation instead of a wrestling ground for zero-sum rivalry.\n\nReuters: Japan said on Wednesday that it will develop and mass produce a cruise missile and high-velocity ballistic missile as it seeks the ability to strike more distant targets as part of a military expansion aimed at meeting threats from China and Russia. China was mentioned in the procurement plan unveiled in the Ministry of Defense’s annual budget today. Does the foreign ministry have any comment on that?\n\n\n\nZhao Lijian: I answered a relevant question yesterday and you may refer to that.\n\nBeijing Youth Daily: According to reports, Republican Arizona Governor Doug Ducey has arrived in Taiwan, and will meet Tsai Ing-wen and Joseph Wu, participate in activities of the business community and meet with representatives of the semiconductor sector in Taiwan. What is your comment on that?\n\n\n\nZhao Lijian: There is only one China in the world. Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory. China firmly rejects any official interaction between the US and Taiwan in any form and in any name. We urge relevant parties in the US to abide by the one-China principle and the provisions of the three China-US joint communiqués, stop all forms of official contact with Taiwan, and stop sending wrong signals to “Taiwan independence” forces. China will take strong measures to resolutely defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\nBloomberg: The Taiwan Army Chief of Staff has said that the Javelin anti-tank missiles that Taiwan has ordered from the US are now in the production and delivery stage. My first question would be, do you have any comment on this update on the status of the anti-tank missiles? And separately, the Taiwan military has said that it plans to increase an order of the HIMARS rocket system, increasing the number from 11 to 29. That’s according to a report from a news agency in Taiwan. Does the foreign ministry have any comment on this increase in rocket systems?\n\n\n\nZhao Lijian: I noted relevant reports. Let me just say that the Taiwan authorities’ attempt to seek independence by soliciting US support will lead nowhere.\n\nMASTV: In April, US Republican Senator Lindsey Graham openly asked the Taiwan authorities to buy $8 billion worth of Boeing 787 planes during his visit to Taiwan. Recently, news agencies in Taiwan reported that Taiwan’s China Airlines will buy Boeing airplanes which means that the Taiwan authorities lapped up the deal peddled by Graham. Do you have any comment?\n\nZhao Lijian: Certain US politicians use Taiwan visits as a money generator and make an exorbitant ask to the Taiwan authorities. This is hardly news. The DPP authorities have been squandering the hard-earned money of the people in Taiwan and have been reduced to an ATM for US politicians to seek selfish gains.\n\nReuters: Solomon Islands on Tuesday said that it would be suspending entry into its waters for foreign navy ships pending adoption of a new process for approval of port visits. This is an attempt to better police its Exclusive Economic Zones. Does the foreign ministry have any comment on this decision?\n\n\n\nZhao Lijian: Solomon Islands is a sovereign country. It has the right to make its own decisions.\n\nAFP: Today, Michelle Bachelet ends her mandate as the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and she has not yet released the assessment on the human rights conditions in Xinjiang. How does China view her work? Is China satisfied that she hasn’t released the report?\n\n\n\nZhao Lijian: The post of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is very important and comes with great responsibilities. China believes in the importance for anyone in that position to adhere to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, strictly observe the mandate of the UN General Assembly, work under the principles of objectivity, impartiality, non-selectivity and non-politicization, advance all types of human rights in a balanced way, engage in dialogue and cooperation with member states and oppose the wrong practice of politicizing human rights and double standards.\n\nToday, August 31, is Ms. Bachelet’s last day in office. As to the assessment you mentioned, China has made clear its stern position on many occasions. We firmly oppose the release of a so-called assessment on Xinjiang by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The assessment is a pure stunt orchestrated by the US and a handful of other Western countries. We hope the High Commissioner will make the right decision.\n\nReuters: A Taiwanese defense official told reporters at a news briefing that for aircraft and ships that enter Taiwan sea and air territory, the national army, referring to Taiwan national army, will exercise right to self-defense to counterattack without exception. The same defense official said the same right to counterattack Chinese drones would apply. Does the foreign ministry have any comment?\n\n\n\nZhao Lijian: Let me start by saying that Taiwan is a province of China and it does not have a “defense ministry”. The act of the Taiwan authorities to heighten tensions does not mean anything.\n\nBloomberg: I want to ask about a report that came out on Tuesday by US cyber security firm Proofpoint. In that report, the company alleges that a Chinese hacker group that has links to the Chinese government was behind an email fishing campaign that targeted energy projects in the South China Sea among other projects and government agencies. Do you have any comment?\n\n\n\nZhao Lijian: The firm you mentioned has no professionalism or credibility to speak of. Recently, it has frequently collaborated with the US government to systematically spread disinformation on the so-called “China hacking attacks”, serving as the “white gloves” of the US government. We believe the international community has its own judgement on the firm’s real intention.",
    "Chinese Narrative on Taiwan": "Resolving the Taiwan question and realizing China’s complete reunification is a shared aspiration of all the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation. It is indispensable for the realization of China’s rejuvenation. It is also a historic mission of the Communist Party of China (CPC). The CPC, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people have striven for decades to achieve this goal.\n\nThe 18th National Congress of the CPC in 2012 heralded a new era in building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Xi Jinping at the core, the CPC and the Chinese government have adopted new and innovative measures concerning Taiwan. They have continued to chart the course of cross-Straits relations, safeguard peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits, and promote progress towards national reunification. However, in recent years the Taiwan authorities, led by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), have redoubled their efforts to divide the country, and some external forces have tried to exploit Taiwan to contain China, and prevent the Chinese nation from achieving complete reunification, and halt the process of national rejuvenation.\n\nThe CPC has united the Chinese people and led them in fulfilling the First Centenary Goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects as scheduled, and in embarking on a new journey toward the Second Centenary Goal of building China into a modern socialist country.\n\nThe Chinese nation has achieved a historic transformation from standing upright to becoming prosperous and growing in strength, and national rejuvenation is driven by an unstoppable force. This marks a new starting point for reunification.\n\nThe Chinese government has published two previous white papers on Taiwan. One was The Taiwan Question and Reunification of China in August 1993, and the other was The One-China Principle and the Taiwan Issue in February 2000. These two white papers provided a comprehensive and systematic elaboration of the basic principles and policies regarding the resolution of the Taiwan question. This new white paper is being released to reiterate the fact that Taiwan is part of China, to demonstrate the resolve of the CPC and the Chinese people and their commitment to national reunification, and to emphasize the position and policies of the CPC and the Chinese government in the new era.\n\nI. Taiwan Is Part of China – This Is an Indisputable Fact\n\nTaiwan has belonged to China since ancient times. This statement has a sound basis in history and jurisprudence. New archeological discoveries and research findings regularly attest to the profound historical and cultural ties between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits. A large number of historical records and annals document the development of Taiwan by the Chinese people in earlier periods.\n\nThe earliest references to this effect are to be found, among others, in the Seaboard Geographic Gazetteer compiled in the year 230 by Shen Ying of the State of Wu during the Three Kingdoms Period. The royal court of the Sui Dynasty had on three occasions sent troops to Taiwan, called Liuqiu at that time. Starting from the Song and Yuan dynasties, the imperial central governments of China all set up administrative bodies to exercise jurisdiction over Penghu and Taiwan.\n\nIn 1624, Dutch colonialists invaded and occupied the southern part of Taiwan. In 1662, General Zheng Chenggong was hailed as a national hero, led an expedition, and expelled them from the island. Subsequently, the Qing court gradually set up more administrative bodies in Taiwan. In 1684, a Taiwan prefecture administration was set up under the jurisdiction of Fujian Province. In 1885, Taiwan’s status was upgraded and it became the 20th province of China.\n\nIn July 1894, Japan launched a war of aggression against China. In April 1895, the defeated Qing government was forced to cede Taiwan and the Penghu Islands to Japan. During the Chinese People’s War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression (1931-1945), China’s Communists called for the recovery of Taiwan. Talking with American journalist Nym Wales on May 15, 1937, Mao Zedong said that China’s goal was to achieve a final victory in the war – a victory that would recover the occupied Chinese territories in Northeast China and to the south of the Shanhai Pass, and secure the liberation of Taiwan.\n\nOn December 9, 1941, the Chinese government issued a declaration of war against Japan and proclaimed that all treaties, conventions, agreements, and contracts regarding relations between China and Japan had been abrogated and that China would recover Taiwan and the Penghu Islands.\n\nThe Cairo Declaration issued by China, the United States, and the United Kingdom on December 1, 1943, stated that it was the purpose of the three allies that all the territories Japan had stolen from China, such as Northeast China, Taiwan, and the Penghu Islands, should be restored to China.\n\nThe Potsdam Proclamation was signed by China, the United States, and the United Kingdom on July 26, 1945, and was subsequently recognized by the Soviet Union. It reiterated: “The terms of the Cairo Declaration shall be carried out.” In September of the same year, Japan signed the instrument of surrender, in which it promised that it would faithfully fulfill the obligations laid down in the Potsdam Proclamation. On October 25 the Chinese government announced that it was resuming the exercise of sovereignty over Taiwan, and the ceremony to accept Japan’s surrender in Taiwan Province of the China war theater of the Allied powers was held in Taibei (Taipei). From that point forward, China had recovered Taiwan de jure and de facto through a host of documents with international legal effect.\n\nOn October 1, 1949, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) was founded, becoming the successor to the Republic of China (1912-1949), and the Central People’s Government became the only legitimate government of the whole of China. The new government replaced the previous KMT regime in a situation where China, as a subject under international law, did not change and China’s sovereignty and inherent territory did not change. As a natural result, the government of the PRC should enjoy and exercise China’s full sovereignty, which includes its sovereignty over Taiwan.\n\nAs a result of the civil war in China in the late 1940s and the interference of external forces, the two sides of the Taiwan Straits have fallen into a state of protracted political confrontation. But the sovereignty and territory of China have never been divided and will never be divided, and Taiwan’s status as part of China’s territory has never changed and will never be allowed to change.\n\nAt its 26th session in October 1971, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 2758, which undertook “to restore all its rights to the People’s Republic of China and to recognize the representatives of its Government as the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations, and to expel forthwith the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek from the place which they unlawfully occupy at the United Nations and in all the organizations related to it”. This resolution settled once and for all the political, legal, and procedural issues of China’s representation in the UN, and it covered the whole country, including Taiwan. It also spelled out that China has one single seat in the UN, so there is no such thing as “two Chinas” or “one China, one Taiwan”.\n\nThe specialized agencies of the UN later adopted further resolutions restoring the PRC as its lawful seat and expelling the representatives of the Taiwan authorities. One of these is Resolution 25.1 adopted at the 25th World Health Assembly in May 1972. It was clearly stated in the official legal opinions of the Office of Legal Affairs of the UN Secretariat that “the United Nations considers ‘Taiwan’ as a province of China with no separate status”, and the “‘authorities’ in ‘Taipei’ are not considered to… enjoy any form of government status”. At the UN the island is referred to as “Taiwan, Province of China”.\n\nResolution 2758 is a political document encapsulating the one-China principle whose legal authority leaves no room for doubt and has been acknowledged worldwide. Taiwan does not have any ground, reason, or right to join the UN, or any other international organization whose membership is confined to sovereign states.\n\nIn recent years some elements in a small number of countries, the US foremost among them, have colluded with forces in Taiwan, to falsely claim that the resolution did not conclusively resolve the issue of Taiwan’s representation. Puffing up the illegal and invalid Treaty of San Francisco and disregarding the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Proclamation, and other international legal documents, they profess that the status of Taiwan has yet to be determined, and declare their support for “Taiwan’s meaningful participation in the UN system”. What they are actually attempting to do is to alter Taiwan’s status as part of China and create “two Chinas” or “one China, one Taiwan” as part of a political ploy – using Taiwan to contain China. These actions in violation of Resolution 2758 and international law are a serious breach of political commitments made by these countries. They damage China’s sovereignty and dignity and treat the basic principles of international law with contempt. The Chinese government has condemned and expressed its resolute opposition to them.\n\nThe one-China principle represents the universal consensus of the international community; it is consistent with the basic norms of international relations. To date, 181 countries including the United States have established diplomatic relations with the PRC on the basis of the one-China principle. The China-US Joint Communique on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations, published in December 1978, states: “The Government of the United States of America acknowledges the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China.” It also states: “The United States of America recognizes the Government of the People’s Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China. Within this context, the people of the United States will maintain cultural, commercial, and other unofficial relations with the people of Taiwan.”\n\nThe Constitution of the People’s Republic of China, adopted at the Fifth Session of the Fifth National People’s Congress (NPC) in December 1982, stipulates: “Taiwan is part of the sacred territory of the People’s Republic of China. It is the inviolable duty of all Chinese people, including our compatriots in Taiwan, to accomplish the great task of reunifying the motherland.”\n\nThe Anti-Secession Law, adopted at the Third Session of the 10th NPC in March 2005, stipulates: “There is only one China in the world. Both the mainland and Taiwan belong to one China. China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity brook no division. Safeguarding China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity is the common obligation of all Chinese people, the Taiwan compatriots included. Taiwan is part of China. The state shall never allow the ‘Taiwan independence’ secessionist forces to make Taiwan secede from China under any name or by any means.”\n\nThe National Security Law, adopted at the 15th meeting of the Standing Committee of the 12th NPC in July 2015, stipulates: “The sovereignty and territorial integrity of China brook no violation or separation. Safeguarding national sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity is the common duty of all Chinese citizens, including Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan compatriots.”\n\nWe are one of China, and Taiwan is part of China. This is an indisputable fact supported by history and the law. Taiwan has never been a state; its status as part of China is unalterable. Any attempt to distort these facts and dispute or deny the one-China principle will end in failure.\n\nII. Resolute Efforts of the CPC to Realize China’s Complete Reunification\n\nThe CPC has always been dedicated to working for the well-being of the Chinese people and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Soon after its founding in 1921, the CPC set itself the goal of freeing Taiwan from colonial rule, reuniting it with the rest of the country, and liberating the whole nation, including compatriots in Taiwan. It has made a tremendous effort to achieve this goal.\n\nThe CPC is committed to the historic mission of resolving the Taiwan question and realizing China’s complete reunification. Under its resolute leadership, people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits have worked together to de-escalate tension across the Straits. They have set out on a path of peaceful development and made many breakthroughs in improving cross-Straits relations.\n\nAfter the founding of the PRC in 1949, China’s Communists, under the leadership of Mao Zedong, proposed the essential guideline, underlying principle, and basic policy for peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question. The CPC prepared and worked for the liberation of Taiwan, thwarted the Taiwan authorities’ plans to attack the mainland, and foiled attempts to create “two Chinas” and “one China, one Taiwan”. Through their efforts, the lawful seat and rights of the PRC in the United Nations were restored and the one-China principle was subscribed to by the majority of countries, laying important groundwork for peaceful reunification. The CPC central leadership established high-level contact with the Taiwan authorities through proper channels in pursuit of a peaceful solution to the Taiwan question.\n\nFollowing the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee in 1978, with the establishment of diplomatic relations between the PRC and the United States, China’s Communists, led by Deng Xiaoping, defined the fundamental guideline for peaceful reunification in the vital interests of the country and the people and on the basis of the consensus for peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question. The CPC introduced the creative and well-conceived concept of One Country, Two Systems, and applied it first in resolving the questions of Hong Kong and Macao. It took action to ease military confrontation across the Taiwan Straits, restore contact, and open up people-to-people exchanges and cooperation, opening a new chapter in cross-Straits relations.\n\nAfter the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee in 1989, China’s Communists, led by Jiang Zemin, made eight proposals for the development of cross-Straits relations and the peaceful reunification of China. The CPC facilitated agreement across the Straits on the 1992 Consensus, which embodies the one-China principle. It initiated cross-Straits consultations and negotiations, resulting in the first talks between heads of the non-governmental organizations authorized by the two sides of the Straits, and expanded cross-Straits exchanges and cooperation in various fields. The CPC took firm action against separatist activities led by Lee Teng-hui, and struck hard at the separatist forces seeking “Taiwan independence”. It ensured the smooth return of Hong Kong and Macao to China and applied the policy of One Country, Two Systems, which had a constructive impact on the settlement of the Taiwan question.\n\nAfter the 16th CPC National Congress in 2002, China’s Communists, led by Hu Jintao, highlighted the importance of peaceful development of cross-Straits relations. The CPC pushed for the enactment of the Anti-Secession Law to curb separatist activities in Taiwan, hosted the first talks between the leaders of the CPC and the Kuomintang in six decades since 1945, and defeated attempts by Chen Shui-bian to fabricate a legal basis for “independence”. The CPC effected profound changes in moving the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations forward by promoting institutionalized consultations and negotiations that produced fruitful results, establishing overall direct two-way links in mail, business, and transport, and facilitating the signing and implementation of the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement.\n\nAfter the 18th CPC National Congress in 2012, China’s Communists, under the leadership of Xi Jinping, took a holistic approach to cross-Straits relations in keeping with changing circumstances, added substance to the theory on national reunification and the principles and policies concerning Taiwan, and worked to keep cross-Straits relations on the right track. The CPC developed its overall policy for resolving the Taiwan question in the new era and set out the overarching guideline and a program of action.\n\nAt its 19th National Congress in October 2017, the CPC affirmed the basic policy of upholding One Country, Two Systems and promoting national reunification, and emphasized its resolve never to allow any person, any organization, or any political party, at any time or in any form, to separate any part of Chinese territory from China.\n\nIn January 2019, Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee and president of China, addressed a meeting marking the 40th anniversary of the release of the Message to Compatriots in Taiwan. In his speech, Xi Jinping proposed major policies to advance the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations and the peaceful reunification of China in the new era. These are: first, working together to promote China’s rejuvenation and its peaceful reunification; second, seeking a Two Systems solution to the Taiwan question and making innovative efforts toward peaceful reunification; third, abiding by the one-China principle and safeguarding the prospects for peaceful reunification; fourth, further integrating development across the Straits and consolidating the foundations for peaceful reunification; fifth, forging closer bonds of heart and mind between people on both sides of the Straits and strengthening joint commitment to peaceful reunification.\n\nThe CPC and the Chinese government have thereby adopted a series of major measures for charting the course of cross-Straits relations and realizing China’s peaceful reunification:\n\n– The CPC and the Chinese government have facilitated the first meeting and direct dialogue between leaders of the two sides since 1949, raising exchanges and interactions to new heights, opening up a new chapter, and creating new space for cross-Straits relations. This is a new milestone. The departments in charge of cross-Straits affairs on both sides have established regular contact and communication mechanisms on a common political foundation, and the heads of the two departments have exchanged visits and set up hotlines.\n\n– Upholding the one-China principle and the 1992 Consensus, the CPC and the Chinese government have facilitated exchanges between political parties across the Straits, and conducted dialogues, consultations, and in-depth exchanges of views on cross-Straits relations and the future of the Chinese nation with relevant political parties, organizations, and individuals in Taiwan. These efforts have resulted in consensus on multiple issues and promoted a number of joint initiatives exploring the Two Systems solution to the Taiwan question with all sectors of Taiwan society.\n\n– Guided by the conviction that people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits are of the same family, the CPC and the Chinese government has promoted peaceful development of cross-Straits relations and integrated development of the two sides for the benefit of both the mainland and Taiwan. We have also refined the institutional arrangements, policies, and measures to promote cross-Straits exchanges and cooperation, designed to advance the wellbeing of the people of Taiwan. These include the delivery of water from the coastal province of Fujian to Kinmen Island, electronic travel passes for Taiwan residents to enter or leave the mainland, residence permits for Taiwan residents, progressively ensuring that Taiwan compatriots have equal access to public services so as to facilitate their studying, starting businesses, working and living on the mainland, and an ongoing effort to pave the way for Taiwan to benefit first from the mainland’s development opportunities.\n\n– While countering interference and obstruction from separatist forces, the CPC and the Chinese government have called on the people of Taiwan to promote effective and in-depth cooperation and people-to-people exchanges in various fields across the Straits. Having overcome the impact of COVID-19, we have held a number of exchange events such as the Straits Forum and maintained the momentum of cross-Straits exchanges and cooperation.\n\n– Resolute in defending state sovereignty and territorial integrity and opposing separatist activities and external interference, the CPC and the Chinese government have safeguarded peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits and the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation. We have taken lawful action against and effectively deterred separatist forces. We have handled Taiwan’s external exchanges in a sound manner and consolidated the international community’s commitment to the one-China principle.\n\nUnder the guidance of the CPC, great progress has been made in cross-Straits relations over the past seven decades, especially since the estrangement between the two sides was ended. Increased exchanges, broader cooperation, and closer interactions have brought tangible benefits to people across the Straits, especially in Taiwan. This fully demonstrates that cross-Straits amity and cooperation are mutually beneficial.\n\nThe volume of cross-Straits trade was only US$46 million in 1978. It rose to US$328.34 billion in 2021, up by a factor of more than 7,000. The mainland has been Taiwan’s largest export market for the last 21 years, generating a large annual surplus for the island. The mainland is also the largest destination for Taiwan’s off-island investment. By the end of 2021, Taiwan businesses had invested in almost 124,000 projects on the mainland, to a total value of US$71.34 billion.\n\nIn 1987 less than 50,000 visits were made between the two sides; by 2019 this number had soared to about 9 million. In the past three years, affected by COVID-19, online communication has become the main form of people-to-people interactions across the Straits, and the numbers of people participating in and covered by online communication are reaching new highs.\n\nThe CPC has always been the spine of the Chinese nation, exercising strong leadership in realizing national rejuvenation and reunification. Its consistent efforts over the decades to resolve the Taiwan question and achieve complete national reunification are based on the following:\n\nFirst, the one-China principle must be upheld, and no individual or force should be allowed to separate Taiwan from China.\n\nSecond, it is imperative to strive for the well-being of all Chinese people, including those in Taiwan, and to realize the aspirations of all Chinese people for a better life.\n\nThird, we must follow the principles of freeing the mind, seeking truth from facts, maintaining the right political orientation, breaking new ground, and defending the fundamental interests of the nation and the core interests of the state in formulating principles and policies on work related to Taiwan.\n\nFourth, it is necessary to have the courage and skill to fight against any force that attempts to undermine China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity or stands in the way of its reunification.\n\nFifth, extensive unity and solidarity must be upheld to mobilize all factors to fight against any force that would divide the country, and pool strengths to advance national reunification.\n\nIII. China’s Complete Reunification Is a Process That Cannot Be Halted\n\nAgainst a backdrop of profound and complex changes in the domestic and international situation, our cause of complete national reunification is facing new challenges. The CPC and the Chinese government have the strength and the confidence to deal with complexities and overcome risks and threats, and the ability to take great strides forward on the path to national reunification.\n\n1. Complete Reunification Is Critical to National Rejuvenation\n\nThroughout China’s 5,000-year history, national reunification and opposition to the division have remained a common ideal and a shared tradition of the whole nation. In the modern era from the mid-19th century, due to the aggression of Western powers and the decadence of feudal rule, China was gradually reduced to a semi-feudal, semi-colonial society, and went through a period of suffering worse than anything it had previously known. The country endured intense humiliation, the people were subjected to great pain, and the Chinese civilization was plunged into darkness. Japan’s 50-year occupation of Taiwan epitomized this humiliation and inflicted agony on both sides of the Taiwan Straits. Our two sides face each other just across a strip of water, yet we are still far apart. The fact that we have not yet been reunified is a scar left by history on the Chinese nation. We Chinese on both sides should work together to achieve reunification and heal this wound.\n\nNational rejuvenation has been the greatest dream of the Chinese people and the Chinese nation since the modern era began. Only by realizing complete national reunification can the Chinese people on both sides of the Straits cast aside the shadow of civil war and create and enjoy lasting peace. National reunification is the only way to avoid the risk of Taiwan being invaded and occupied again by foreign countries, to foil the attempts of external forces to contain China, and safeguard the sovereignty, security, and development interests of our country. It is the most effective remedy to secessionist attempts to divide our country, and the best means to consolidate Taiwan’s status as part of China and advance national rejuvenation. It will enable us to pool the strengths of the people on both sides, build our common home, safeguard our interests and well-being, and create a brighter future for the Chinese people and the Chinese nation. As Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the great pioneer of China’s revolution, once said, “Unification is the hope of all Chinese nationals. If China can be unified, all Chinese will enjoy a happy life; if it cannot, all will suffer.”\n\nIn exploring the path to rejuvenation and prosperity, China has endured vicissitudes and hardships. “Unification brings strength while division leads to chaos.” This is a law of history. The realization of complete national reunification is driven by the history and culture of the Chinese nation and determined by the momentum towards and circumstances surrounding our national rejuvenation. Never before have we been so close to, confident in, and capable of achieving the goal of national rejuvenation. The same is true when it comes to our goal of complete national reunification. The Taiwan question arose as a result of weakness and chaos in our nation, and it will be resolved as national rejuvenation becomes a reality. When all the Chinese people stick together and work together, we will surely succeed in realizing national reunification on our way to national rejuvenation.\n\n2. National Development and Progress Set the Direction of Cross-Straits Relations\n\nChina’s development and progress are the key factor determining the course of cross-Straits relations and the realization of complete national reunification. In particular, the great achievements over four decades of reform, opening up and modernization have had a profound impact on the historical process of resolving the Taiwan question and realizing complete national reunification. No matter which political party or group is in power in Taiwan, it cannot alter the course of progress in cross-Straits relations or the trend towards national reunification.\n\nInternational Monetary Fund statistics show that in 1980 the GDP of the mainland was about US$303 billion, just over 7 times that of Taiwan, which was about US$42.3 billion; in 2021, the GDP of the mainland was about US$17.46 trillion, more than 22 times that of Taiwan, which was about US$790 billion.\n\nChina’s development and progress, and in particular the steady increases in its economic power, technological strength, and national defense capabilities, are an effective curb against separatist activities and interference from external forces. They also provide broad space and great opportunities for cross-Straits exchanges and cooperation. As more and more compatriots from Taiwan, especially young people, pursue their studies, start businesses, seek jobs, or go to live on the mainland, cross-Straits exchanges, interaction and integration are intensified in all sectors, and the economic ties and personal bonds between the people on both sides run deeper, and our common cultural and national identities grow stronger, leading cross-Straits relations towards reunification.\n\nThe CPC has united the Chinese people and led them in embarking on the new journey of building China into a modern socialist country in all respects. Following the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, the mainland has improved its governance and maintained long-term economic growth; it enjoys a solid material foundation, a wealth of human resources, a huge market, strong resilience in development, and social stability. It, therefore, has many strengths and favorable conditions for further development, and these have become the driving force for reunification.\n\nGrounding its effort in the new development stage, the mainland is committed to applying the new development philosophy, creating a new development dynamic, and promoting high-quality development. As a result, the overall strength and international influence of the mainland will continue to increase, and its influence over and appeal to Taiwanese society will keep growing. We will have a more solid foundation for resolving the Taiwan question and a greater ability to do so. This will give a significant boost to national reunification.\n\n3. Any Attempt by Separatist Forces to Prevent Reunification Is Bound to Fail\n\nTaiwan has been an integral part of China’s territory since ancient times. Moves to separate Taiwan from China represent the serious crime of secession and undermine the common interests of compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Straits and the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation. They will lead nowhere.\n\nThe DPP authorities have adopted a separatist stance and colluded with external forces in successive provocative actions designed to divide the country. They refuse to recognize the one-China principle and distort and deny the 1992 Consensus. They assert that Taiwan and the mainland should not be subordinate to each other, and proclaim a new “two states” theory. On the island, they constantly press for “de-sinicization” and promote “incremental independence”. They incite radical separatists in and outside the DPP to lobby for amendments to their “constitution” and “laws”. They deceive the people of Taiwan, incite hostility against the mainland, and obstruct and undermine cross-Straits exchanges, cooperation, and integrated development. They have steadily built up their military forces with the intention of pursuing “independence” and preventing reunification by force. They join with external forces in trying to sow the seeds of “two Chinas” or “one China, one Taiwan”. The actions of the DPP authorities have resulted in tension in cross-Straits relations, endangering peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits, undermining the prospects, and restricting the space for peaceful reunification. These are obstacles that must be removed in advancing the process of peaceful reunification.\n\nTaiwan belongs to all the Chinese people, including the 23 million Taiwan compatriots. The Chinese people are firm in their resolve and have a deep commitment to safeguarding China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation and this resolve and commitment will frustrate any attempt to divide the country. When Taiwan was invaded by a foreign power more than 100 years ago, China was a poor and weak country. More than 70 years ago, China defeated the invaders and recovered Taiwan. Today, China has grown into the world’s second-largest economy. With significant growth in its political, economic, cultural, technological, and military strength, there is no likelihood that China will allow Taiwan to be separated again. Attempts to reject reunification and split the country are doomed because they will founder against the history and culture of the Chinese nation as well as the resolve and commitment of more than 1.4 billion Chinese people.\n\n4. External Forces Obstructing China’s Complete Reunification Will Surely Be Defeated\n\nExternal interference is a prominent obstacle to China’s reunification. Still lost in delusions of hegemony and trapped in a Cold War mindset, some forces in the US insist on perceiving and portraying China as a major strategic adversary and a serious long-term threat. They do their utmost to undermine and pressurize China, exploiting Taiwan as a convenient tool. The US authorities have stated that they remain committed to the one-China policy and that they do not support “Taiwan independence”. But their actions contradict their words. They are clouding the one-China principle in uncertainty and compromising its integrity. They are contriving “official” exchanges with Taiwan, increasing arms sales, and colluding in the military provocation. To help Taiwan expand its “international space”, they are inducing other countries to interfere in Taiwan affairs, and concocting Taiwan-related bills that infringe upon the sovereignty of China. They are creating confusion around what is black and white, right and wrong. On the one hand, they incite separatist forces to create tension and turmoil in cross-Straits relations. On the other hand, they accuse the mainland of coercion, pressurizing Taiwan, and unilaterally changing the status quo, in order to embolden these forces and create obstacles to China’s peaceful reunification.\n\nThe important principles of respecting state sovereignty and territorial integrity as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations are the cornerstones of modern international law and basic norms of international relations. It is the sacred right of every sovereign state to safeguard national unity and territorial integrity. It goes without saying that the Chinese government is entitled to take all measures necessary to settle the Taiwan question and achieve national reunification, free of external interference.\n\nBehind the smokescreens of “freedom, democracy, and human rights” and “upholding the rules-based international order”, some anti-China forces in the US deliberately distort the nature of the Taiwan question – which is purely an internal matter for China – and try to deny the legitimacy and justification of the Chinese government in safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity. This clearly reveals their intention of using Taiwan to contain China and obstruct China’s reunification, which should be thoroughly exposed and condemned.\n\nThese external forces are using Taiwan as a pawn to undermine China’s development and progress, and obstruct the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. They are doing so at the cost of the interests, well-being, and future of the people of Taiwan rather than for their benefit. They have encouraged and instigated provocative actions by the separatist forces; these have intensified cross-Straits tension and confrontation and undermined peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. This runs counter to the underlying global trends of peace, development, and win-win cooperation, and goes against the wishes of the international community and the aspiration of all peoples.\n\nShortly after the PRC was founded, even though the country itself had to be rebuilt on the ruins of decades of war, China and its people won a resounding victory in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea (1950-1953). We defeated a powerful and well-armed enemy through gallantry and tenacity. In doing so, we safeguarded the security of the newly founded People’s Republic, reestablished the status of China as a major country in the world, and demonstrated our heroic spirit, our lack of fear, and our will to stand up against the abuse of the powerful.\n\nChina is firmly committed to peaceful development. At the same time, it will not flinch under any external interference, nor will it tolerate any infringement upon its sovereignty, security and development interests. Relying on external forces will achieve nothing for Taiwan’s separatists, and using Taiwan to contain China is doomed to fail.\n\nTranquility, development, and a decent life are the expectations of our Taiwan compatriots and the common aspiration of those on both sides of the Taiwan Straits. Under the strong leadership of the CPC, the Chinese people and the Chinese nation have stood upright, won prosperity, and grown in strength. A moderately prosperous society in all respects has been built on the mainland, where a large population once lived in dire poverty. We now have better conditions, more confidence, and greater capabilities. We can complete the historic mission of national reunification so that both sides of the Straits can enjoy a better life. The wheel of history rolls on towards national reunification, and it will not be stopped by any individual or any force.\n\nIV. National Reunification in the New Era\n\nTaking into consideration the overall goal of national rejuvenation in the context of global change on a scale unseen in a century, the CPC and the Chinese government have continued to follow the CPC’s fundamental guidelines on the Taiwan question and implement its principles and policies toward Taiwan, and have made concrete efforts to promote peaceful cross-Straits relations, integrate the development of the two sides, and work towards national reunification.\n\n1. Upholding the Basic Principles of Peaceful Reunification and One Country, Two Systems\n\nNational reunification by peaceful means is the first choice of the CPC and the Chinese government in resolving the Taiwan question, as it best serves the interests of the Chinese nation as a whole, including our compatriots in Taiwan, and it works best for the long-term stability and development of China. We have worked hard to overcome hardships and obstacles to peaceful reunification over the past decades, showing that we cherish and safeguard the greater good of the nation, the wellbeing of our compatriots in Taiwan, and peace on both sides.\n\nThe One Country, Two Systems principle is an important institutional instrument created by the CPC and the Chinese government to enable peaceful reunification. It represents a great achievement of Chinese socialism. Peaceful reunification and One Country, Two Systems are our basic principles for resolving the Taiwan question and the best approach to realizing national reunification. Embodying the Chinese wisdom – we thrive by embracing each other – they take full account of Taiwan’s realities and are conducive to long-term stability in Taiwan after reunification.\n\nWe maintain that after peaceful reunification, Taiwan may continue its current social system and enjoy a high degree of autonomy in accordance with the law. The two social systems will develop side by side for a long time to come. One Country is the precondition and foundation of Two Systems; Two Systems are subordinate to and derive from One Country, and the two are integrated under the one-China principle.\n\nWe will continue working with our compatriots in Taiwan to explore a Two Systems solution to the Taiwan question and increase our efforts toward peaceful reunification. In designing the specifics for implementing One Country, Two Systems, we will give full consideration to the realities in Taiwan and the views and proposals from all walks of life on both sides, and fully accommodate the interests and sentiments of our compatriots in Taiwan.\n\nEver since the One Country, Two Systems principle was proposed, certain political forces have been misrepresenting and distorting its objectives. The DPP and the authorities under its leadership have done everything possible to target the principle with baseless criticisms, and this has led to misunderstandings about its aims in some quarters of Taiwan. It is a fact that since Hong Kong and Macao returned to the motherland and were reincorporated into national governance, they have embarked on a broad path of shared development together with the mainland, and each complements the others’ strengths. The practice of One Country, Two Systems has been a resounding success.\n\nFor a time, Hong Kong faced a period of damaging social unrest caused by anti-China agitators both inside and outside the region. Based on a clear understanding of the situation there, the CPC and the Chinese government upheld the One Country, Two Systems principle, made some appropriate improvements, and took a series of measures that addressed both the symptoms and root causes of the unrest. Order was restored and prosperity returned to Hong Kong. This has laid a solid foundation for the law-based governance of Hong Kong and Macao and the long-term continuation of One Country, Two Systems.\n\nTo realize peaceful reunification, we must acknowledge that the mainland and Taiwan have their own distinct social systems and ideologies. The One Country, Two Systems principle is the most inclusive solution to this problem. It is an approach that is grounded in democratic principles, demonstrates goodwill, seeks peaceful resolution of the Taiwan question, and delivers mutual benefit. The differences in the social system are neither an obstacle to reunification nor a justification for secessionism. We firmly believe that our compatriots in Taiwan will develop a better understanding of the principle and that the Two Systems solution to the Taiwan question will play its full role while compatriots on both sides work together towards peaceful reunification.\n\nPeaceful reunification can only be achieved through consultation and discussion as equals. The long-standing political differences between the two sides are the fundamental obstacles to the steady improvement of cross-Straits relations, but we should not allow this problem to be passed down from one generation to the next. We can phase in flexible forms of consultation and discussion. We are ready to engage with all parties, groups, or individuals in Taiwan in a broad exchange of views aimed at resolving the political differences between the two sides based on the one-China principle and the 1992 Consensus. Representatives will be recommended by all political parties and all sectors of society on both sides, and they will engage in democratic consultations on the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations, integrated development of the two sides, and the peaceful reunification of our country.\n\n2. Promoting Peaceful Cross-Straits Relations and Integrated Development\n\nPeaceful cross-Straits relations and integrated development pave the way for reunification and serve to benefit our people on both sides. Thus, both sides should work together towards this goal. We will extend integrated development, increase exchanges and cooperation, strengthen bonds, and expand common interests in the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations. In this way, we will all identify more closely with the Chinese culture and Chinese nation, and heighten the sense of our shared future. This lays solid foundations for peaceful reunification.\n\nWe will explore an innovative approach to integrated development and take the lead in setting up a pilot zone for integrated cross-Straits development in Fujian Province, advancing integration through better connectivity and more preferential policies, and based on mutual trust and understanding. Both sides should continue to promote connectivity in any area where it is beneficial, including trade and economic cooperation, infrastructure, energy and resources, and industrial standards. We should promote cooperation in culture, education, and health care, and the sharing of social security and public resources. We should support neighboring areas or areas with similar conditions on the two sides in providing equal, universal, and accessible public services. We should take active steps to institutionalize cross-Straits economic cooperation and create a common market for the two sides to strengthen the Chinese economy.\n\nWe will improve the systems and policies to guarantee the well-being of Taiwanese compatriots and ensure that they are treated as equals on the mainland, and we will protect their legitimate rights and interests here in accordance with the law. We will support our fellow Chinese and enterprises from Taiwan in participating in the Belt and Road Initiative, major regional development strategies, and the strategy for coordinated regional development. We will help them integrate into the new development dynamic, participate in high-quality development, share in more development opportunities, and benefit from national socio-economic development.\n\nWe will expand cross-Straits exchanges and cooperation in various fields and overcome any obstacles and obstructions. We will encourage our people on both sides to pass on the best of traditional Chinese culture and ensure that it grows in new and creative ways. We will strengthen communication among the general public and the younger generations on both sides, and encourage more fellow Chinese in Taiwan – young people in particular – to pursue studies, start businesses, seek jobs, or live on the mainland. This will help people on both sides to expand mutual understanding, strengthen mutual trust, consolidate a shared sense of identity, and forge closer bonds of heart and mind.\n\n3. Defeating Separatism and External Interference\n\nSeparatism will plunge Taiwan into the abyss and bring nothing but disaster to the island. To protect the interests of the Chinese nation as a whole, including our compatriots in Taiwan, we must resolutely oppose it and work for peaceful reunification. We are ready to create vast space for peaceful reunification, but we will leave no room for separatist activities in any form.\n\nWe Chinese will decide our own affairs. The Taiwan question is an internal affair that involves China’s core interests and the Chinese people’s national sentiments, and no external interference will be tolerated. Any attempt to use the Taiwan question as a pretext to interfere in China’s internal affairs or obstruct China’s reunification will meet with the resolute opposition of the Chinese people, including our compatriots in Taiwan. No one should underestimate our resolve, will, and ability to defend China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\nWe will work with the greatest sincerity and exert our utmost efforts to achieve peaceful reunification. But we will not renounce the use of force, and we reserve the option of taking all necessary measures. This is to guard against external interference and all separatist activities. In no way does it target our fellow Chinese in Taiwan. Use of force would be the last resort taken under compelling circumstances. We will only be forced to take drastic measures to respond to the provocation of separatist elements or external forces should they ever cross our red lines.\n\nWe will always be ready to respond with the use of force or other necessary means to interfere with external forces or radical action by separatist elements. Our ultimate goal is to ensure the prospects of China’s peaceful reunification and advance this process.\n\nSome forces in the US are making every effort to incite groups inside Taiwan to stir up trouble and use Taiwan as a pawn against China. This has jeopardized peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits, obstructed the Chinese government’s efforts towards peaceful reunification, and undermined the healthy and steady development of China-US relations. Left unchecked, it will continue to escalate tension across the Straits, further disrupt China-US relations, and severely damage the interests of the US itself. The US should abide by the one-China principle, deal with Taiwan-related issues in a prudent and proper manner, stand by its previous commitments, and stop supporting Taiwan separatists.\n\n4. Working with Our Fellow Chinese in Taiwan Towards National Reunification and Rejuvenation\n\nNational reunification is an essential step toward national rejuvenation. The future of Taiwan lies in China’s reunification, and the well-being of the people in Taiwan hinges on the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, an endeavor that bears on the future and destiny of the people on both sides. A united and prosperous China will be a blessing for all Chinese, while a weak and divided China will be a disaster. Only China’s rejuvenation and prosperity can bring lives of plenty and happiness to both sides. But it requires the joint efforts of both sides, as does the complete reunification of the country.\n\nSeparatist propaganda and the unresolved political dispute between the two sides have created misconceptions over cross-Straits relations, problems with national identity, and misgivings over national reunification among some fellow Chinese in Taiwan. Blood is thicker than water, and people on both sides of the Straits share the bond of kinship. We have great patience and tolerance and we will create conditions for closer exchanges and communication between the two sides, increase our compatriots’ knowledge of the mainland and reduce these misconceptions and misgivings, in order to help them resist the manipulation of separatists.\n\nWe will join hands with our fellow Chinese in Taiwan to strive for national reunification and rejuvenation. We hope they will stand on the right side of history, be proud of their Chinese identity, and fully consider the position and role of Taiwan in China’s rejuvenation. We hope they will pursue the greater good of the nation, resolutely oppose separatism and any form of external interference, and make a positive contribution to the just cause of China’s peaceful reunification.\n\nV. Bright Prospects for Peaceful Reunification\n\nOnce peaceful reunification is achieved under One Country, Two Systems, it will lay new foundations for China to make further progress and achieve national rejuvenation. At the same time, it will create huge opportunities for social and economic development in Taiwan and bring tangible benefits to the people of Taiwan.\n\n1. Taiwan Will Have a Vast Space for Development\n\nTaiwan boasts a high level of economic growth, industries with distinctive local features, and robust foreign trade. Its economy is highly complementary to that of the mainland. After reunification, the systems and mechanisms for cross-Straits economic cooperation will be further improved. Backed up by the vast mainland market, Taiwan’s economy will enjoy broader prospects, become more competitive, develop steadier and smoother industrial and supply chains, and display greater vitality in innovation-driven growth. Many problems that have long afflicted Taiwan’s economy and its people can be resolved through integrated cross-Straits development with all possible connections between the two sides. Taiwan’s fiscal revenues can be better employed to improve living standards, bringing real benefits to the people and resolving their difficulties.\n\nTaiwan’s cultural creativity will also enjoy a great boost. Both sides of the Taiwan Strait share the culture and ethos of the Chinese nation. Nourished by the Chinese civilization, Taiwan’s regional culture will flourish and prosper.\n\n2. The Rights and Interests of the People in Taiwan Will Be Fully Protected\n\nProvided that China’s sovereignty, security, and development interests are guaranteed after reunification Taiwan will enjoy a high degree of autonomy as a special administrative region. Taiwan’s social system and its way of life will be fully respected, and the private property, religious beliefs, and lawful rights and interests of the people in Taiwan will be fully protected. All Taiwan compatriots who support the reunification of the country and rejuvenation of the nation will be the masters of the region, contributing to and benefitting from China’s development. With a powerful motherland in support, the people of Taiwan will enjoy greater security and dignity and stand upright and rock-solid in the international community.\n\n3. Both Sides of the Taiwan Straits Will Share the Triumph of National Rejuvenation\n\nThe people of Taiwan are brave, diligent, and patriotic, and have made unremitting efforts to improve themselves. They revere their ancestry and love their homeland. Working together and applying their talents, people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits will create a promising future. After reunification, we Chinese will bridge gaps and differences caused by long-term separation, share a stronger sense of national identity, and stand together as one. After reunification, we can leverage complementary strengths in pursuit of mutual benefit and common development. After reunification, we can join hands to make the Chinese nation stronger and more prosperous, and stand taller among all the nations of the world.\n\nThe people separated by the Taiwan Straits share the same blood and a common destiny. After reunification, China will have greater international influence and appeal, and a stronger ability to shape international public opinion, and the Chinese people will enjoy greater self-esteem, self-confidence, and national pride. In Taiwan and on the mainland the people will share the dignity and triumph of a united China and be proud of being Chinese. We will work together to refine and implement the Two Systems solution to the Taiwan question, improve the institutional arrangements for implementing the One Country, Two Systems policy, and ensure lasting peace and stability in Taiwan.\n\n4. Peaceful Reunification of China Is Conducive to Peace and Development in the Asia-Pacific and the Wider World\n\nPeaceful cross-Straits reunification is of benefit not only to the Chinese nation but to all peoples and the international community as a whole. The reunification of China will not harm the legitimate interests of any other country, including any economic interests they might have in Taiwan. On the contrary, it will bring more development opportunities to all countries; it will create more positive momentum for prosperity and stability in the Asia-Pacific and the rest of the world; it will contribute more to building a global community of shared future, promoting world peace and development, and propelling human progress.\n\nAfter reunification, foreign countries can continue to develop economic and cultural relations with Taiwan. With the approval of the central government of China, they may set up consulates or other official and quasi-official institutions in Taiwan, international organizations and agencies may establish offices, relevant international conventions can be applied, and relevant international conferences can be held there.\n\nConclusion\n\nOver its 5,000-year history, China has created a splendid culture that has shone throughout the world from past times to the present and has made an enormous contribution to human society. After a century of suffering and hardship, the nation has overcome humiliation, emerged from backwardness, and embraced boundless development opportunities. Now, it is striding towards the goal of national rejuvenation.\n\nEmbarking on a new journey in a new era, the CPC and the Chinese government will continue to rally compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Straits, and lead the efforts to answer the call of the times, shoulder historic responsibilities, grasp our fate, and our future in our own hands, and work hard to achieve national reunification and rejuvenation.\n\nThe journey ahead cannot be all smooth sailing. However, as long as we Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Straits devote our ingenuity and energy to the same goal, let there be no doubt – we will tolerate no foreign interference in Taiwan, we will thwart any attempt to divide our country, and we will combine as a mighty force for national reunification and rejuvenation. The historic goal of reuniting our motherland must be realized and will be realized.",
    "Why does China react to US war consignment to Taiwan?": "Beijing [China], September 8 (ANI): After the United States announced USD 1.1 billion worth of military equipment to Taiwan, China came out with a vociferous response.\n\nThe sale of military equipment to Taiwan includes Harpoon and Sidewinder missiles, according to the Defence Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA).\n\nThe US State Department approved an estimated USD 355 million in sales of Harpoon Block II Missiles and related equipment to Taiwan in a bid to modernize the island's defence capabilities and serve US security interests.\n\nThe State Department also approved the sale of Block II Sidewinder Missiles and related equipment at an estimated cost of USD 85.6 million. The possible sale of USD 665.4 million in Surveillance Radar Program support and equipment was also approved.\n\nInsisting that the latest arms sales and are for defensive purposes, the Biden administration said this will not alter the basic military balance in the region.\n\nThis comes amid already heightened tension between Washington and Beijing over House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's Taiwan trip. Pelosi's trip to Taiwan this month triggered a new round of tensions in the region.\n\n\n\nFollowing the visit of the US delegation, Beijing launched large-scale military exercises in the vicinity of the island. China's ruling Chinese Communist Party views Taiwan as part of its territory and vows to \"reunify\" the island with the Chinese mainland.\n\nOver the latest arms sale, China on Wednesday said \"China has always been unequivocally against the US's military contact with Taiwan and arms sales to Taiwan. Taiwan is a province of China. There is no such thing as defence for Taiwan\".\n\n\"US arms sales to China's Taiwan region violate the US's political commitment in the three China-US joint communiques, especially the August 17 Communique. By selling arms to Taiwan, the US is supporting and conniving at \"Taiwan independence\" and creating new factors that could lead to tensions in the Taiwan Strait,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said during a press briefing on September 7.\n\n\"The US side needs to strictly abide by the one-China principle and the provisions of the three China-US joint communiques and stop using Taiwan against China. China will act resolutely in response to acts that undermine China's sovereignty and security and interfere in China's internal affairs.\"\n\nWriting for Geopolitica.info, Valerio Fabbri said China responded to US military supplies to Taiwan with aviation intrusions into Taiwan's ADIZ.\n\n\"Beijing decried the military deliveries as undermining Chinese sovereignty and a violation of the three joint communiques signed by the United States and China, which it interprets as a guarantee by the United States to reduce arms supplies to Taiwan,\" he said.\n\nFabbri said it seems China is trying to display strength, but it is failing miserably at the same.

    "As the US seeks to exploit Taiwan’s market, it speaks with a poisoned beef tongue": "Illustration: Liu Rui/GT\n\nIt was reported on Tuesday that the Taiwan authorities had suspended the import of beef tongues from the US as the shipments were found to be infected with parasites, rendering them a health and safety hazard.The suspension comes amid the overwhelming enthusiasm of separatists in Taiwan to deepen trade and economic ties with the US in a bid to promote separation from China, even accumulating in the \"formal opening\" of trade talks between the US and the island of Taiwan following US house speaker Nancy Pelosi's provocative visit at the beginning of August.However, this incidence shows that the US lavishes its overtures on Taiwan with a forked tongue, and in this case a beef one. America has no interest other than to exploit the island for its own political and commercial interests, using it as a tool against the Chinese mainland. It only shows in turn how Taiwan's regional leader Tsai Ing-wen is willing to sell out the island's best interests in the view to obtaining whatever support and attention from foreign powers she can get.The import of parasite-ridden beef tongues is not the only example of Taiwan overlooking blatant problems in its bid to court the US, or for that matter its allies too. Only last year did the DPP authorities decide to lower the island's food safety standards in order to pave the way for the import of ractopamine pork, which is banned in the European Union, the Chinese mainland and many other countries and regions across the world for its proven side effects of increasing the probability of heart problems. The DPP authorities did so despite overwhelming public opposition to the measure, rigging a referendum in their favor.The intention is quite simple: To import more and more goods from the so-called allies with the aim of literally giving them whatsoever they want in the view of trying to inflate the island's relevance as much as possible. Another example is the fact that Taiwan also greenlighted the import of food from the nuclear-contaminated prefecture and waters of Fukushima, Japan, another set of goods most countries have been avoiding due to blatant health and safety risks associated with its dumping of contaminated wastewater into the sea. The DPP authorities once again have no issues with this, despite the fact that all other regional neighbors, including the Chinese mainland, South Korea, and the Philippines, have lodged strong opposition to the plans.Similarly, if China has a dispute with other countries and implements countermeasures, the island of Taiwan often dives in head first as a publicity stunt to try and deliberately undermine such countermeasures, attempting to ludicrously present themselves as an \"alternative.\" When China stopped buying Australian wine, the island ordered a shipment; when China imposed countermeasures on Lithuania, the island said it would buy its products instead. The island is conducting its trade policies solely on an opportunistic, public relations-driven and reactionary nature that considers nothing in terms of serious policy outcomes.This means any trade talks with the US going forward will not be to Taiwan's benefit at all but will involve one-sided demands from Washington's behalf designed to squarely supplement protectionist policies. Taiwan will be asked to lower more and lower regulations in the bid to import more and more sub-standard quality food from the US. While the US will quite obviously use flowery rhetoric such as \"cooperation on emerging technologies,\" what this really means is to get Taiwan firms to set up manufacturing in the US, which of course will serve to undermine the island's own exports and strategic relevance in the future.Yet none of these little stunts serve to change the larger economic reality in respect to Taiwan and the mainland. China is the world's largest consumer market consisting of 1.4 billion people. Taiwan is but a province of China with less total population than that of Shanghai Municipality. The idea that the island can frame itself as a long-term alternative market by acquiescing to whatever reasonable demands its backers seek, from lowering food standards to buying potentially nuclear contaminated products, is short-termist, ill-conceited and harmful to its own population.In reality, the long-term strategic goal of the US is to exploit the entire Chinese market, not merely the island of Taiwan, which is but a pawn in this game. In doing so, the DPP authorities try to sell its people and the island short with these shoddy policies. The US only speaks with a poisoned tongue in its assurances to Taiwan, a poisoned beef tongue to be exact.The author is a political and historical relations analyst. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",
    "In Taiwan, anxiety - and a little apathy - about China": "1News US Correspondent Anna Burns-Francis discusses the US House Speaker’s controversial visit to the island China claims as their territory.\n\nFred Chin Him-San is living testament to the political and economic transformation of Taiwan, that island that is, for all but name, a country in its own right.\n\nHe spent 12 years in a Taiwanese prison, jailed after he was tortured into confessing to setting off bombs at a bank and a news agency in 1971 – charges that he denies to this day.\n\nAt that time, Taiwan was under authoritarian rule and martial law, the legacy of its split from China in 1949, at the end of the civil war. The Communists took control of the mainland, while the Nationalists set themselves up in Taiwan, which had until that time been a province of China.\n\nIt was the start of a split that has only widened over the past 70 years: China today is under the authoritarian grip of the Communist Party and its leader, Xi Jinping, who’s expected to be installed for an unprecedented third term next month.\n\nJames Halpin/Stuff Fred Chin standing next to a door at the prison. Prisoners were humiliated by being forced to use the smaller green door within the larger door.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n* Tiktok concerns on agenda for intelligence talks\n\n* NZ's benefits from Taiwan joining CPTPP will be muted - official\n\n* Taiwan buys a billion dollars worth of US arms as tensions with China rise\n\n\n\nWhile Taiwan, which spent decades under iron-fisted Nationalist rule, transformed itself into one of the most vibrant democracies in Asia from 1996. Parties have peacefully won and lost elections, and the island made history in 2019 by becoming the first place in Asia to legalise same-sex marriage.\n\nExemplifying Taiwan’s transformation, Chin, now 73, is a tour guide at the Museum of Human Rights in Taipei and greeted US House speaker Nancy Pelosi during her controversial visit to the island in August.\n\n“I can't stand 12 years in prison.Why don't you sentence me to death?,” Chin recalled thinking at the time.\n\nChin was not imprisoned by the Communist-run People’s Republic of China. He was imprisoned by Taiwan’s former ruling military dictatorship. He was presented as a living warning of the extreme oppression and arbitrariness that authoritarian states deal out to their citizens, regardless of where they are on the globe.\n\nChin spoke to Asia-Pacific journalists, including one from Stuff, who were visiting Taiwan this month, part of a trip organised by the Taiwanese government to support their effort to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\nThe CPTPP trade bloc comprises 11 Asia-Pacific countries representing 13 percent of the global economy, and both China and Taiwan want to join.\n\nChina’s diplomatic and economic run-ins with Australia, another founding member of the bloc, have probably ended that hope politically, analysts in Sydney say.\n\nJames Halpin/Stuff A view of Taipei from the viewing floor of Taipei 101.\n\nTaiwan is now trying to seize upon the growing wariness towards an increasingly authoritarian China by presenting itself as the democratic and pluralistic alternative.\n\nXi, for his part, has called “reunification” of Taiwan with the mainland an “unshakeable commitment” – even though the island has never been part of the Communist-run People’s Republic of China.\n\nAmerican and Taiwanese officials have previously floated 2025 or 2030 as possible deadlines for Xi’s goal, but the New York Times recently reported that U.S. officials now believe China may make a strong move against Taiwan within the next 18 months.\n\nIn the 70-plus years since the split, China and Taiwan have grown steadily apart, despite their historical cultural and linguistic roots. Opinion polls now regularly show that Taiwanese don't like what they see when looking across the Taiwan Strait. And the island nation isn't going to simply give up in a 21st century David and Goliath.\n\nThe United States has made the greatest gesture towards Taiwan, with President Joe Biden pledging to defend the island if it comes under attack and starting free-trade talks with Taipei.\n\nBut other countries – from Japan to Australia and, to a lesser extent, New Zealand – have increasingly been risking the wrath of Beijing by voicing concern about the Chinese Communist Party’s intentions and the spectre of military action in the Taiwan Strait.\n\nFor New Zealand, the issue has long been an economic one. China accounts for a full third of New Zealand’s exports, with two-way trade worth about $32 billion a year. While Taiwan has become Aotearoa’s sixth-largest goods export market, the value pales in comparison, at only $1.6bn.\n\nRICKY WILSON/STUFF Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern delivered the keynote speech to the China Business Summit in Auckland on Monday, August 1, 2022. She urged China to say it did not support Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine, and spoke about the history of the NZ-China relationship.\n\nOn a week-long visit to Taipei, journalists were repeatedly told, by everyone from senior government officials to former prisoners like Chin, that Taiwan is the version of China that regional countries can – and should – do business with.\n\nEspousing the benefits of Taiwan joining the CPTPP to journalists from member countries, officials presented a goal that would not only increase regional trade but would also reduce its reliance on China, its largest trading partner (also Australia and New Zealand’s largest trading partner).\n\nTaiwan's mainland affairs council, the executive body which advises the government on affairs with China, thinks Xi could make a move before 2024, when both Taiwan and the US have presidential elections.\n\nDeputy minister Chiu Chui-Cheng​ said the CCP would look to strengthen its position on reunification after Xi’s rubber-stamp re-election next month and before the US and Taiwanese elections in 2024.\n\n“For example, they would try to unify with Taiwan,” Chiu said. “The tactics that they would use include grey zone tactics, and they would try to create conflicts and therefore establish the new normal.”\n\nThe grey zone is the murky types of attacks that don’t quite constitute a physical attack, like a disinformation campaign, hacking, or funding mercenaries.\n\nChina has already increased the number of incursions by its fleet into Taiwanese waters and the two are shooting down each other's drones. There is a feeling in Taipei that China will could accidentally – or worse, purposefully – stumble into conflict.\n\nJames Halpin/Stuff Wang Hsui-Yan said she felt positively towards the US and it helping Taiwan against China.\n\nOne the sidelines of the grand geopolitical machinations between superpowers are the everyday Taiwanese.\n\nWang Hsui-Yan, a 28-year-old who sells small bamboo plants at a flower market in central Taipei that are given as good luck gifts, said she wasn't too worried about China.\n\n“I’m not really scared of China. The moment, this time, our relationship is difficult,” she said.\n\nWang said she thought of the US as being friendly that could help Taiwan with national security and thought Pelosi’s visit was a good thing to support the island.\n\nAlen Chen, a 28-year-old cook in the old town of Dadaocheng, who had pigs’ heart, intestines and snout on display in the refrigerated window of his restaurant, said he didn’t care about Taiwan’s politics.\n\nHe said he wasn’t worried about Taiwan being stuck in the middle of a geopolitical storm and didn’t care that Pelosi had visited the island.\n\nJames Halpin/Stuff Alen Chen, a chef, said the politics didn’t worry him.\n\n“It’s not my business, I don’t care,” he said. “I have no feelings, I’m not scared, don’t be scared,” he said.\n\nTaiwan joining the deal won’t be as beneficial for New Zealand as the other countries in the bloc, as NZ already has a free trade agreement with the country called ANZTEC, but there still would be some chances for economic gain.\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade has not explicitly supported Taiwan’s bid, saying\n\n“we have consistently taken care not to pronounce on the merits of any accession candidate”.\n\nNew Zealand has also been muted in its political support for Taiwan, with Nanaia Mahuta merely saying that New Zealand was interested “in peace and stability in the region, including across the Taiwan Strait, and emphasised the importance of de-escalation, diplomacy and dialogue” after China began military exercises encircling the island.\n\nJames Halpin/Stuff Fred Chin standing in the room he was sentenced to prison in, over 50 years later.\n\nBill Keh-Ming Chen, Taiwan’s highest representative in New Zealand, said Taipei would “love” for Aotearoa to participate in freedom of navigation navy exercises through the Strait.\n\nBut officials in Taipei, like vice foreign minister Alexander Yui, wouldn’t single out New Zealand for more support but said multilateral trade shared the political risk from China amongst more countries. “When we talk about bilateral trade agreements there is some political sensitivities.”\n\nBut Chin, the former prisoner, didn’t bother with diplomatic niceties.\n\n“We need to support from all overseas, spiritual support for us is more important than the weapons, we have determination as Taiwanese to defend our own country, but what we need most is spiritual support from all overseas free countries,” he said.\n\n“People are born to be free, we have to show our love, our compassion, not to hate each other.”\n\nJames Halpin travelled to Taiwan courtesy of Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",
    "Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning’s Regular Press Conference on September 7, 2022": "Xinhua News Agency: Kyrgyz President Sadyr Zhaparov talked about his understanding of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in a recent interview. He said, \"If a party is driven by selfless goals, striving for the common good, prosperity, well-being of the people, then such a party will always be supported by its people.\" The President also spoke highly of the development of relations between Kyrgyzstan and China since the establishment of diplomatic ties 30 years ago. He also expressed readiness to advance cooperation with China in such fields as green development, innovation and digital economy. Do you have any response to these remarks?\n\nMao Ning: As you quoted, President Zhaparov said in his interview that a party striving for the well-being of the people will always be supported by its people. This is very true. A Harvard University survey among the Chinese people spanning over a decade found that more than 90 percent of respondents are satisfied with the Party and their government. In 2021, as many as 91 percent of Chinese interviewed by Edelman, a top global public relations consultancy firm, said they trust their government, the highest recorded all over the world for years running. These numbers fully support President Zhaparov’s observation. The CPC has the overwhelming support of the people because it puts the people front and center and because it is firmly committed to pursuing happiness for the people and rejuvenation for the nation.\n\nI also noted that in the interview, President Zhaparov mentioned China-Kyrgyzstan Belt and Road cooperation and spoke highly of the Belt and Road Initiative proposed by President Xi Jinping. I can share with you that China-Kyrgyzstan Belt and Road cooperation has produced many important outcomes. The China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan highway, the new North-South highway and other connectivity projects have boosted the economic development of Kyrgyzstan and become roads of prosperity, affluence and happiness for the local people.\n\nChina fully echoes President Zhaparov’s comments on China-Kyrgyzstan relations. China and Kyrgyzstan are truly good neighbors, good friends, good partners and good brothers. Since the establishment of diplomatic ties 30 years ago, China and Kyrgyzstan have made new breakthroughs in bilateral relations, enjoyed productive practical cooperation and further upgraded our traditional friendship under the principles of mutual respect, good-neighborliness, friendship, mutual assistance, and win-win cooperation. We are glad to note that under the leadership of President Zhaparov, Kyrgyzstan has enjoyed political stability, economic development and social prosperity. China is ready to work with Kyrgyzstan to exchange experience on state governance, further tap the potential for cooperation, foster new highlights of cooperation, move forward hand in hand on the path of common development, and create an even better future for China-Kyrgyzstan relations.\n\nBloomberg: I have two questions regarding the television interview with the Chinese Ambassador to Australia Xiao Qian, who gave an interview with ABC Australia yesterday. The first one is that the Ambassador said that he’d welcome a meeting between the Chinese and Australian leaders under the right conditions. So my question to the foreign ministry is what are those conditions? What constitutes the right conditions? My second question in relation to the same interview is that the Ambassador said that the CPC has broad support in China. What is the metric for showing that?\n\nMao Ning: On your first question, the sound and steady development of China-Australia relations is in the shared interest of both countries and peoples and conducive to peace, stability, development and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region. China stands ready to follow the principle of mutual respect and mutual benefit and work with Australia to steadily advance bilateral relations along the track of comprehensive strategic partnership and bring benefits to the two peoples. As for a meeting between the leaders, I have nothing to share.\n\nOn your second question, in my reply to the previous journalist’s question, I mentioned some figures from surveys conducted by institutions in the West, which found that more than 90 percent of Chinese respondents are satisfied with the Party and their government. In 2021, as many as 91 percent of Chinese interviewed said they trust their government. This is rarely seen in the world and fully shows that the CPC has the broad support of the Chinese people.\n\nKyodo News: The Japanese government will hold a state funeral for former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on September 27. Will China send a representative to attend the funeral? If so, who?\n\nMao Ning: I have nothing to share on this question.\n\nAFP: It’s actually a follow-up question on the question that Bloomberg just raised. There has been new comments today by Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese who said that he would welcome a meeting with the Chinese leader. What’s your opinion on these comments and is a meeting between the two leaders possible in the next few months?\n\nMao Ning: China values its relations with Australia and is ready to work with Australia to steadily advance bilateral relations along the track of comprehensive strategic partnership. As for the specific question you mentioned, I have no information to offer.\n\nAFP: The Russian Ambassador to China just announced that Russian President Putin will meet with the Chinese leader on the margins of the SCO Summit in Samarkand. Can you confirm this?\n\nMao Ning: The Chinese and Russian heads of state have maintained close exchange through various means. Regarding the specific question you raised, I have nothing to share at this moment.\n\nBeijing Youth Daily: It is reported that the US Department of Defense released a new space policy document which recognized space as a “priority domain of national military power” and vowed to enhance the US’s space capabilities to defend against “hostile” use of space. The policy paper also said the US will step up military cooperation with allies to jointly promote “norms of behavior for responsible space activities” and provide a durable strategic advantage for the US and its allies. Do you have any comment?\n\nMao Ning: For a long time, the US has openly defined space as a war-fighting domain. It has built the US Space Force and Space Command, developed and deployed space-based offensive weapons, conducted offensive and defensive military exercises and technology tests, and intensified military cooperation with its allies. All this has heightened the risks of military miscalculation and conflict. Also, the US has been stonewalling China and Russia’s space arms control initiative and obstructing negotiation for a legal instrument on arms control in space. In 2017, due to the sole opposition of the US, the UN Group of Governmental Experts on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space was unable to conclude a report.\n\nThe new document on space policy released by the US Department of Defense recognizes space as a priority domain of national military power, further aggravating the trend of turning outer space into a weapon and a battlefield. It poses a grave challenge to the peace and security of outer space, blatantly tramples on the international consensus on peaceful use of outer space, and fully exposes the US ambition of increasing military build-up and war preparedness and seeking dominance in outer space. The US is in no position whatsoever to talk about so-called “norms of behavior for responsible space activities”.\n\nThe US should respect the shared concerns of the international community, immediately stop the negative moves that could undermine security of outer space, step up to its due responsibilities and stop hindering negotiations for a legal instrument on arms control in outer space.\n\nShenzhen TV: We noted that German chemical giant BASF held a ceremony yesterday to mark the full construction of its Zhanjiang Verbund site in Guangdong and the inauguration of its first plant of the site. What’s your comment?\n\nMao Ning: Yesterday, a ceremony was held by BASF to inaugurate its Zhanjiang Verbund site in Guangdong. The ceremony was attended by Han Zheng, Member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council. With a total investment of about 10 billion euros, the site is the largest single investment project by a German enterprise in China. The inauguration of the project is of important significance for deepening China-Germany trade and investment cooperation and for the two countries’ efforts to jointly address the impact of COVID-19 and keep the industrial and supply chains of the global petrochemical industry secure and stable.\n\nThe continued growth of German investment in China since the beginning of this year is evidence that German businesses are optimistic about China’s economic prospects and business environment and fully confident in investing and operating in China.\n\nChina stands ready to work with all countries to enhance economic, trade and investment cooperation and grow an open world economy.\n\nThe Paper: Deputy Spokesperson of the US State Department Vedant Patel said during a press briefing on September 6 that the US’s latest arms sales to Taiwan are for defensive purposes and there is no reason for China to react. Do you have any comment on this?\n\nMao Ning: China has always been unequivocally against the US’s military contact with Taiwan and arms sales to Taiwan. Taiwan is a province of China. There is no such thing as “defense for Taiwan”. US arms sales to China’s Taiwan region violate the US’s political commitment in the three China-US joint communiqués, especially the August 17 Communiqué. By selling arms to Taiwan, the US is supporting and conniving at “Taiwan independence” and creating new factors that could lead to tensions in the Taiwan Strait. The US side needs to strictly abide by the one-China principle and the provisions of the three China-US joint communiqués and stop using Taiwan against China. China will act resolutely in response to acts that undermine China’s sovereignty and security and interfere in China’s internal affairs.\n\nHubei Media Group: The earthquake that recently struck Luding County, Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Sichuan Province has caught international attention and many countries have expressed sympathies to China. What is the foreign ministry’s comment on this?\n\nMao Ning: Since the earthquake hit Luding, Sichuan on September 5, Russia and many other countries have extended their sympathies to China through various means, and expressed readiness to offer support and assistance for quake relief. We truly appreciate their gesture.\n\nThe Chinese government is doing everything necessary for the quake relief. Teams specializing in various types of rescue have rushed to the sites. Operations are in full swing to search for the missing, save and treat the injured, look after the affected and urgently restore infrastructure in the quake-stricken areas. We have the confidence to prevail over the disaster and rebuild homes for the local people.",
    "PLA needs a limited, lightning war for success in Taiwan": "Were the conflict to remain confined to Taiwan, the PLA would have the upper hand. Once the field of operations widens into other PLA-afflicted theatres, from Djibouti to Gwadar to Hambantota to Kyaukpyu, etc., the PRC would lose control of the military situation even across the Taiwan Straits.\n\nSingapore: War clouds are gathering across the Indo-Pacific, caused by the rush towards domination of that space by CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping. Observers have studied the arbitrary, ruthless manner in which Xi has consolidated his grip over the higher echelons of the CCP, a political party that has over 90 million members and which controls China. Unlike Deng Xiaoping, who also worked to fulfil the goals of the CCP but was pragmatic in deciding how these were to be achieved, Xi is in what seems a reckless rush to PRC primacy, while further expanding the control of the party-directed state machinery over the population. Although Xi has been compared to Chairman Mao Zedong on numerous occasions, the reality is that behind his sometimes-blustery rhetoric, Mao was a realist, who acted only when he was forced to (as in Korea in the 1950s war) or (as in the 1962 conflict with India) regarded conditions as opportune for success. There were his ill-fated initiatives such as the Great Leap Forward in the 1950s, which ended up as a Great Leap Backward where the economy was concerned. The CCP Chairman believed that, inspired by the Chinese Communist Party led by himself, ordinary citizens could defy the laws of production and even triple the overall production of iron needed for infrastructure development. He turned out to be wrong, and infrastructure in the PRC remained in a doleful state. There was no room in Mao’s mind for himself or the PRC to play second fiddle to any country or individual except as a temporary tactic. He bristled at the assumption of Joseph Stalin and later Nikita Khrushchev that it was the USSR, not the PRC, that was the leader of the international communist movement, but kept his peace until the mid-1960s out of pragmatic considerations.\n\nU.S. GAVE UNNECESSARY CONCESSIONS TO PRC\n\nDuring the latter part of the 1960s, Chairman Mao intensified the sending out of feelers to Washington for a rapprochement against their common enemy, the USSR. Eventually, it was an affluent lady in Hong Kong who on behalf of CCP elements contacted an acquaintance, then Vice-President Richard M. Nixon, and gave him the idea that such a rapprochement was feasible, and that it would substantially boost Washington’s capability to hasten the fall of the Soviet Union, an eventuality that had also been pursued by Mao since the 1960s. Soon after he took over as President of the US in 1969, Nixon activated this Hong Kong channel and when a welcoming response was received from Beijing, he sent an initially sceptical Henry Kissinger to that capital. It is another matter that because of the unlimited access that Kissinger used to give key media personalities, the credit (and now the blame) for Nixon’s opening towards the PRC was given to Kissinger. There began to appear glowing reports on his diplomacy, all quoting “high-level” anonymous sources, all of which comprised Kissinger himself. He soon got powerfully influenced by Premier Zhou Enlai, who would have become a billionaire selling used cars had he been a US citizen, and charmed his US interlocutor into ensuring that numerous concessions were given to the Chinese side that were far in excess of what the CCP leadership had anticipated and would have been satisfied with.\n\nTAIWAN’S RISK WINDOW OPENING\n\nAlthough troves of sensitive intelligence, including on India, began to be handed over to the PRC on a regular basis by Kissinger and his successors, it was after the ascent to power of Deng Xiaoping in 1978 before business-to-business links between the US and China grew. Among the most enthusiastic in investing money in China were Japanese businesspersons, who were followed a few years later by the Taiwanese. Fast forward to when Xi Jinping was in charge of Fujian province, from where in past times most of those who crossed the Taiwan Strait and settled down had come from. People in the province are considered to have a gambling instinct, and this may have been a factor in the exodus that began to significantly populate the island with Fujianese around two centuries ago. The next wave of immigrants from China came in 1949, and was composed of individuals from all across China, which had by then fallen to the CCP, thereby forcing KMT supremo Chiang Kai-shek to seek refuge in Taiwan. While the original settlers from Fujian are known within the island country as “Taiwanese”, those who came ashore with Chiang are referred to as “Mainlanders”. The latter began grabbing much of the land and assets of Taiwan, breeding the dissatisfaction and desire for freedom from control by outsiders that became the dominant mood in Taiwanese society across all except the very old among the “Mainlanders” by the close of the initial decade of the 21st century.\n\nThe “Taiwanese” segment of Taiwan’s population tilts towards the independence-minded DPP rather than the PRC-friendly KMT. The people of the island country want overwhelmingly to retain their freedom from PRC control, but equally they crave a peaceful future. The train of Taiwanese democracy moves along these two tracks, but the vow by CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping that Taiwan would by whatever means necessary be united with the PRC during his tenure has unsettled the status quo. That Xi will fulfil his objective of securing an unprecedented third term in office by next month is almost certain. However. in that process, Xi would have squandered almost all of the goodwill within the CCP that he had when taking charge in 2012. In his efforts at securing a fourth term in office, Xi would need to boost his popularity within the ruling party substantially, and is likely to consider the conquest of Taiwan the surest path towards that acclaim. Which is why the CCP General Secretary’s impending third 5-year term beginning in October 2022 and lasting into 2027 has created a window of risk for Taiwan unprecedented since 1949. There have been past efforts at subduing Taiwan, such as during the 1958 Second Taiwan Straits crisis that saw the massive shelling of Taiwanese territory by the PRC, a crisis in which there were several thousand casualties on the Taiwanese side, and almost an equal number on the Chinese side, as the KMT government in Taiwan responded with all the firepower they had been given by the US. The Third Taiwan Straits crisis was in 1995, when there were efforts at intimidation through aggressive posturing by the PLA. These were puny in comparison with the level of attempted intimidation caused by the Fourth Taiwan Strait crisis, which erupted during and after House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan on 2 August 2022, a visit that was used as an excuse by Xi to resort to a brazen show of military force across the perimeter of the island country.\n\nCMC DECIDES POLICY ON TAIWAN\n\nFor Xi Jinping, the key institution in China is the Central Military Commission (CMC), which he has headed from the start of his tenure as the party General Secretary. CMC planners are as eager as Xi himself to win control of Taiwan during his third term in office. Whether in the matter of economic or foreign policy, or in the way the military is showcased and used, Xi is as different from Deng as the diminutive but extraordinary leader of the CCP was from Mao. Within the CMC, Xi has steadily transferred responsibility in the planning of operations from older, more cautious senior officers to a youthful cohort of Senior Colonels and Major-Generals who share his aggressive confidence towards a future conflict across the Taiwan Straits. Through a show of force and by psychological and other covert operations in Taiwan, the US and Japan in particular, the CMC together with intelligence and asymmetric warfare specialists, is seeking to create a situation where (a) the Taiwanese population does not put up resistance to an invasion by the PLA but “accepts the inevitable by refusing to try and repel the PLA”, (b) that the Quad will remain on the sidelines of the conflict and not actively involve itself in operations designed to frustrate PLA moves to take over Taiwan, which means that (c) the conflict will remain confined to Taiwan with no recoil anywhere else. There is confidence in the CMC, especially after his 2022 decision to hand over power in Afghanistan to the Taliban, that President Joe Biden lacks a “tiger mindset”, and will recoil from putting US lives in danger should his forces join in the battle to defend Taiwan.\n\nLIVES DON’T MATTER TO XI\n\nIn these calculations by the CMC, the feelings of the population of Taiwan are regarded as inconsequential. It may be remembered that in the 2019 elections in Hong Kong, over 85% of seats and 80% of the vote went to individuals and groups that favoured complete autonomy for Hong Kong from the control of the PRC. From that time onwards, “winning over the people” was dropped as a strategy by the use of the bludgeon. In mid-2020, the National Security Law was passed in the always almost wholly compliant PRC legislature. Soon after that, autonomy was extinguished in Hong Kong, and the HKSAR was converted in effect as just another province of China. A similar use of armed force is expected to extinguish any effort by the elements within Taiwan (and these account for the overwhelming majority of the population) that favour dissociation from the PRC. After the occupation, “traitors” (i.e. those known to be opposed to Beijing’s control) are to be put on trial, and most will escape with jail sentences, while a few of the “extreme independence elements” would be slated for an assisted entry into the afterlife. Hundreds of thousands of citizens are to be identified and “re-educated so that they love the Party and Motherland” i.e. the PRC. In many ways, this would be similar to what has been happening for decades in Xinjiang, where the Uygur population is being taught to “love Party and Motherland” by being put in “re-education centres” where they are being subjected to teaching methods not normally found in schools where pupils are not “re-educated” but simply educated.\n\nIMMEDIATE ESCALATION KEY TO QUAD VICTORY\n\nGiven that US bases in Japan would be within range of PLA artillery firepower were Taiwan to be invaded, it is improbable that even a US President not known for his “tiger” instinct would repeat an Afghanistan 2021 scenario in Taiwan and allow the PLA to take control of a country that is central to US and allied primacy in the Indo-Pacific over the Sino-Russian combine. What would send the PLA plans for a six is the rapid initiation, after initiation of hostilities by the PLA, of Escalation Dominance by the Quad members. This would involve broadening the arena of conflict to the whole of the Indo-Pacific. It may be remembered that in 1965, Prime Minister L.B. Shastri frustrated the plan of General Ayub Khan to grab the entirety of Kashmir by broadening the conflict across the entire India-Pakistan border. Were the conflict to remain confined to Taiwan, the PLA would have the upper hand. Once the field of operations widens into other PLA-afflicted theatres—from Djibouti to Gwadar to Hambantota to Kyaukpyu and other locations where the PLA has set up overt or covert capability—the PRC would lose control of the military situation even across the Taiwan Straits. Only in a scenario that involves the confinement of operations to Taiwan can the CMC scenario of taking control of the island nation in the 12-16 days that its planners believe is the time that they judge to be too short for the US in particular to respond in force sufficient to an invasion by the PLA. Apart from the conflict being confined to Taiwan, another calculation is that the armed forces of Taiwan would very quickly cease to resist, once it became clear to them that external help would be too late and insufficient to affect the final outcome. Similar calculations were made by Corporal Hitler when he approved Operation Sea Lion, the invasion of the British Isles, in 1940. That failed to work, and in the case of Taiwan as well, Xi appears to be making the miscalculation that CCP-resistant forces would fold as rapidly as they did in Hong Kong, a location that has been occupied by the PLA since 1997.\n\nMISSTEPS BY PRESIDENT BIDEN\n\nThe glad tidings for the CMC are that the significantly Eurocentric band of senior officials accumulated by the 46th President of the US are coming up with absurd scenarios that envisions a Ukrainian-style resistance by the Taiwanese people to a PLA invasion. They are therefore discouraging the Taiwanese military from going in for the longer-range weaponry needed in an actual conflict, and are asking them to confine their purchases (unlike in the case of Ukraine, which gets all its armaments free of cost, Taiwan is made to pay for each round of artillery) to items that are designed to defend against a beach landing. Some in the Biden administration are talking of getting the Taiwanese to purchase MANPADS so that every citizen becomes a defender, as in Ukraine. The hi-tech Taiwanese are very different from the oil drilling and farming communities of Ukraine. And having seen what has been happening to Ukraine, most Taiwanese appear to be in no rush to follow the example of that unfortunate country.\n\nBoth the State Department as well as the National Security Council in the US are led by Europeanists in the Biden mould, and both are pitted against the Pentagon in insisting that Taiwan should be given only the means to launch a response to a PLA offensive on the landing shores rather than an active defence strategy in which east coast cities in the PRC would be at risk in the event of PLA aggression. The State Department and NSC’s unreal and wholly reactive strategy that is also favoured by many in the White House plays to the CMC playbook of a quick, sharp cross-strait localised war that accomplishes its tasks before any opposing force can react in force. Should the CMC be convinced that broadening of the conflict by the Quad to other theatres within the Indo-Pacific and active rather than reactive defence by the Taiwanese are outside the realm of possibility, the prospects for initiation of war by the PLA during 2023-27 increase substantially, just as they did in the 1930s as a consequence of the policy of appeasement followed by France and Britain. And even when that was abandoned, the French army did what the PLA now wants the Taiwanese military to do, which is to surrender at speed. Whether it be Taiwan or India, both the State Department as well as the NSC analyse the situation from the Europe First (when not Europe Only) perspective that was a feature of the Clinton administration. Hence the inability to understand the full impact of the economic and other consequences on the policy of the White House to try and grind the Russians down at the cost of Ukrainian lives and land, and to plead for help to Beijing when that capital is seeking to prolong that conflict for as long as needed to complete preparations for Xi’s China Dream (and Taiwan’s Nightmare) to come into operation.\n\nNATO CHASING THE WRONG ENEMY\n\nImmediate escalation of a cross-strait invasion of Taiwan into other theatres and arming the Taiwanese military with the weapons needed for active defence may persuade Xi that the risks of an attempted takeover are too high for him to take. Not for the first time, policymakers in a democracy that are frantic to prevent a war end up creating the conditions for its initiation. The clock will begin ticking as soon as Xi gets his third 5-year term, and thus far, NATO appears to still believe that it is Moscow that represents the most potent threat to its membership and not China. This has, however, not discouraged countries ranging from the Marshall Islands to Tuvalu to Taiwan, not to mention the key members of ASEAN, to boost their defences against any aggressive move by the PLA. Their morale and confidence have been strengthened by the resolute manner in which India has been dealing with the threat posed by a revisionist superpower out to upend the status quo to its exclusive benefit.",
    "Earthquake: The havoc of nature in China-Taiwan-Afghanistan, the earth trembled in September.": "WORLD\n\nEarthquake During the month of September, the havoc of nature has been seen in the form of earthquake in many countries of the world. Due to the earthquake, people have lost their lives in many countries including China, Afghanistan.\n\nThere are many countries, including China, Taiwan, Indonesia and Afghanistan, where earthquakes caused terrible destruction during the month of September. In the last few days, strong earthquake tremors were felt in different countries around the world. Due to which there was a lot of loss of life and property. The biggest impact of this earthquake was seen in Sichuan province of China and Taiwan. The death toll from the earthquake in China has crossed 90. At the same time, strong tremors of earthquake were felt in Taiwan three times within a single day. Many buildings here were torn down and cracks appeared between the roads. Not only this, many bridges have also been broken during this period.\n\n93 people dies in China\n\nStrong earthquake tremors were felt in Luding County in China's Sichuan province on September 5.

    "Chinese President Xi prepares to extend his reign at 20th Party Congress": "Follow us on Image Source : TWITTER@ANI Xi will extend his term in power for another five years, as the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) conducts its all-important 20th Party Congress.\n\nNext month, Chairman Xi Jinping will extend his term in power for another five years, as the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) conducts its all-important 20th Party Congress. Perhaps only the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth II could compare to the pomp and ceremony that will accompany this congress in Beijing, with the weeklong conclave commencing on 16 October. It will be a highly orchestrated affair designed to showcase party solidarity, and to of course glorify the preeminence of Xi.\n\nXi remains firmly in charge of the one-party state, despite swirling rumors - propagated it seems by the Falun Gong and some Indian media - that a coup had occurred in Beijing. Military columns approaching Beijing and mass cancellations of flights were cited as \"evidence\" of Xi being put under house arrest. This is not the case, however, as rumor mills ramp up ahead of such important CCP events. A total of 2,296 delegates have been appointed to the 20th Party Congress, including just over 200 full members and approximately 170 alternate members. They will rubber stamp Xi's third five-year term in office, something unprecedented since the excesses of Mao Zedong's reign.\n\nXi has carved out a niche as paramount leader, with no regulatory end in sight for the end of his tenure. To borrow a quote from George Orwell's Animal Farm, \"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.\" Certainly, none is more equal than Xi. China's state constitution was amended in 2018 to eliminate any presidential limits, thus paving the way for Xi to remain in power indefinitely. Without doubt, Xi will retain his positions of CCP General Secretary and Chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC).\n\nIn November 2021, the Central Committee canonized Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, claiming that it embodies \"the best of the Chinese culture and ethos in our times and represents a new breakthrough in adapting Marxism to the Chinese context\". The Party Constitution is sure to be amended next month.\n\nExpected revisions will \"establish the position of comrade Xi Jinping as the core of the central party authorities and the core of the whole party\", and \"establish the overriding status of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era\". Xi's thoughts will be entrenched within the pantheon of CCP ideologies. Other revisions could be abolition of term limits for the CCP General Secretary and Chairman of the CMC; the Party Constitution does not currently stipulate the length of these two top posts. This is separate to the State Constitution, which was altered in 2018 to abolish the limit of two five-year terms.\n\nDoctor Willy Wo-Lap Lam, a Senior Fellow at The Jamestown Foundation think-tank in the USA, Lam offered this observation: \"Strongmen hate surprises - and will go the distance to ensure such events are carefully choreographed beforehand. This is why supreme leader Xi has repeatedly cautioned against 'black swans' appearing in Chinese politics. The putative Mao Zedong of the 21st century has solid confidence in the nation's artificial intelligence-assisted mass surveillance apparatus; so he has not been daunted by the spate of demonstrations that have broken out in several provinces over bank and real estate defaults and related scandals. Instead, most of Xi's energy has been consumed with finalizing personnel arrangements ahead of the 20th Party Congress that will consolidate the domination of his faction, and at the same time generate enough leeway to pacify opposition factions as well as party elders, many of whom have been disturbed by Xi's apparent Maoist restoration and his anti-US and anti-Western stance.\"\n\nCreative new ideas will thus not appear at this meeting. The congress' main purpose is to eulogize Xi and ensconce him as undisputed leader for a third term. Eschewing the policy of collective leadership introduced to prevent a recurrence of Mao's errors as \"Great Helmsman\", Xi opted to concentrate all decision-making power in his own hands. His hold over such areas as finance, foreign policy, personnel and ideology will be strengthened after the 20th Party Congress, despite the presence of the Communist Youth League Faction headed by Premier Li Keqiang, and the Shanghai Faction previously led by former president Jiang Zemin. In the coming five years, Xi's power will be even more absolute.\n\nThe Central Committee will decide the make-up of the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee and 25-member Politburo. Their two most prominent remaining Communist Youth League Faction members are Li and Vice Premier Hu Chunhua. However, it is likely that one will disappear, and quite possible that neither will remain after October's congress.\n\nIndeed, if Li retires and Hu is not offered a seat, this raises the specter of the Politburo Standing Committee being entirely dominated by Xi. Four candidates -all of whom are Xi's men - to occupy up to three vacant committee seats are Cai Qi, Li Qiang, Chen Min'er and Ding Xuexiang.\n\nYet, stacking the deck like this does not guarantee unity. There was dissension under Mao, and personal ambition will ensure jostling for position occurs under Xi too. If Li retires as premier, then perhaps the most likely replacement is the popular Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference chairman Wang Yang, who was Vice Premier from 2013-18.\n\nIt is difficult to imagine the Chinese elite revolting against Xi. Indeed, elites are more likely to flee the country and establish themselves elsewhere than they are to conduct coups. Similarly, Xi has the populace wrapped up tight with surveillance and internal security forces, so large-scale protest movements like that in 1989 are hard to conceive.\n\nThat is not to say that public grievances against Xi will not grow in the next term. Sixty-nine-year-old Xi will stay in power for at least another five years, and presumably for the next ten until the 22nd Party Congress in 2032. That means he feels he has plenty of time to appoint a successor, and nobody else dare propose one either.\n\nJohn S. Van Oudenaren, Editor-in-Chief of the China Brief at The Jamestown Foundation, commented: \"In the long term, Xi's inability or unwillingness to address the succession issue that plagues all non-monarchical, one-party states fosters immense uncertainty in the PRC system. Xi has rolled back the very modest progress made in the 1990s and 2000s to institutionalize the succession processes for the top-leadership posts. Moreover, the lack of a clear successor as Xi begins his second decade in power is likely to intensify the political maneuvering among sixth- and seventh-generation cadres as the general secretary enters old age.\"\n\nVan Oudenaren added, \"Even if Xi self-selects a successor, as Mao Zedong attempted to do several times, there is no guarantee that such an anointed future leader would have the political clout to take the reins, particularly if the prevailing sentiment among other party elites is to move in an ideological or strategic direction that is at odds with Xi's vision for China.\"\n\nFor his part, Lam assessed: \"The succession issue - as well as whether the CCP can cope with an unexpected event such as the sudden incapacitation of the supreme leader - is a taboo for the official media and heavily censored social media. Due to the longstanding rule of...retirement at 68...sixth-generation rising stars - officials born in the 1960s who would become Politburo Standing Committee members at the 20th or 21st Party Congress in 2027 - might end up being only transitional figures. The top prospects to fill this role include Xi's protege and principal adviser Ding Xuexiang (born 1962) and the Party Secretary of Chongqing, Chen Min'er (1960).\"\n\nThese two will be too old to assume power at the 22nd Party Congress under current protocols. On the other hand, potential successor candidates - those of the seventh generation born in the 1970s - have not yet really emerged or projected themselves on the political stage, since they are still middle-rank officials.\n\nWith Xi at the core of the party, his name enshrined in the Party Constitution, and his power base firmly controlled, the rest of the world can expect continuity of his policies, priorities and strategies. Deep in his being, Xi believes that the East - i.e. China - is rising, whilst the West is in decline. A Cold War has developed largely because of economic, geopolitical and technological competition with the USA. CCP efforts to usurp the US-led global order, to turn upside down established rules and norms, to establish military bases and illegally claim territory in the South China Sea, and its unstinting support of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, have set China on a pathway of confrontation.\n\nBy doing so, China has increasingly isolated itself from all but the most authoritarian of regimes. Xi has charted his course, and with a third term securely in the bag, the USA can expect intensified competition after the 20th Party Congress. Nonetheless, Xi faces significant challenges, including how China will handle COVID-19 now that the rest of the world has mostly learned to live with the pandemic. The country's dynamic zero-COVID policy is like an economic millstone around its neck.\n\nLam commented: \"In light of the CCP's lack of ballot box legitimacy, economic growth and overall public support - or at least acquiescence - are key elements of the party's legitimacy. Apart from...netizens paid to sing the party's praises on social media, a substantial portion of citizens are frustrated by problems including pandemic-related quarantines, growing unemployment, declining spending power on consumer goods, as well as the real estate and banking crises.\"\n\nXi will continue efforts already instituted to ameliorate some of these economic headwinds and to stimulate growth, plus the chairman needs to convince foreign investors not to withdraw from China's market. However, Lam pointed out that the State Council's preferred economic policy is simply a decades-old formula of boosting infrastructure spending at home, the side effect of which is massive government debt. Xi's promotion of a \"whole-country systemic approach\" and \"internal circulation\", amounting to reliance on China's domestic market to generate economic growth, does not suggest a return to Deng Xiaoping's market-oriented approach.\n\nChina's COVID-19 lockdowns are draconian. Yet to backtrack now would belie the CCP's narrative that its governance is superior to the West's. This policy has raised social discontent and stunted the economy, but China is unlikely to drastically alter its approach, at least until after March 2023 when the new government is sworn in.\n\nCertainly, early loosening of strict health protocols would cause COVID infections and deaths to explode, and this would cause political insecurity. Taiwan remains China's whipping boy, and Xi has enforced an even harder line against Taipei after US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan in August. Quite apart from a continuous tempo of warship and aircraft sorties, which now ignore the long-respected median line in the Taiwan Strait, Beijing's latest effort to ostracize Taiwan is to rewrite history in the United Nations.\n\nFor example, Zhang Meifang, China's Ambassador to Ireland, tweeted on 24 September: \"Over the past five decades, the UN has always referred to Taiwan as 'Taiwan, Province of China': this is Taiwan's only status in international law.\"\n\nHowever, this is a blatant lie, for the UN never describes Taiwan like this. The CCP is fraudulently \"altering\" UN documents in an attempt to turn its one-eyed claims into a reality. Not a single document of the UN Security Council or General Assembly support Beijing's claims, as it subverts international norms to achieve its own ends.\n\nThe CCP, in recent decades, has successfully depoliticized the Chinese masses, and encouraged them only to think of economic gain. Xi has never engendered universal popularity, but his anti-reformist policies, creation of a cult personality, rising unemployment, losses on the stock market and in real estate for the middle class, COVID-19 lockdowns and economic headwinds are all combining to tarnish Xi's aura.\n\nVain repetition and mouthing of vacuous slogans such as \"the great renaissance of the Chinese nation\" and the \"Chinese dream\" cannot dispel others' misgivings. If China cannot close the gap with the USA, then Xi's slogans will appear even emptier. Xi has set himself up as China's second Messiah, perhaps hoping to outpace Mao if he manages to secure Taiwan for his own and the CCP's glory. However, if he does not live up to the rhetoric, disappointment and resentment at home may grow. No matter what, the rest of the world will face continuing belligerence from China in the coming five years.\n\n(ANI Inputs)\n\nAlso Read | China warns interlopers on Taiwan issue, says external interference won't be tolerated\n\nLatest India News",

    "Taiwan's military warns it will counterattack without exception if Chinese forces enter its waters or airspace as Beijing's ships and planes move nearby": "Taiwan on Wednesday vowed to counterattack without exception if Chinese ships or planes violated its territory.\n\nThe remarks come as Chinese warplanes and vessels continue to maneuver near the island.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaiwan warned on Wednesday that it would exercise its right to self-defense and counterattack without exception if Beijing's forces entered the self-ruled island's territorial waters and airspace.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Chinese People's Liberation Army dispatched 62 aircraft and seven vessels into areas near Taiwan, the island's defense ministry shared in a statement. The collection of Chinese aircraft included Shenyang J-16 fighter jets, Shaanxi Y-8 EW and ASW transport planes, and the Xi'an JH-7 fighter/bomber.\n\nTaiwan's defense ministry said that it responded to the situation with naval vessels, a combat air patrol, and land-based missile systems, which were used to monitor the nearby Chinese military activity. But during a news conference, military officials said they are willing to take further steps and defend itself if necessary.\n\n\"The closer the incursions are to Taiwan, the stronger our countermeasures will be,\" Maj. Gen. Lin Wen-Huang, who serves as Taiwan's deputy chief of the general staff for operations and planning, told reporters at a press briefing, explaining that naval assets, aviation elements, and coastal fires could be used to dispel Chinese forces.\n\n\"For Chinese aircraft and ships that enter our territorial waters and airspace,\" within 12 nautical miles of the island, Lin explained, \"the national army will exercise the right to self-defense and counterattack without exception.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo far, Chinese warplanes or ships have yet to move within 12 nautical miles of Taiwan's main island, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.\n\nWednesday's remarks, which also included a warning about how Taiwan would respond to incursions by Chinese unmanned aerial vehicles, come just one day after Taiwan fired warning shots at a Chinese drone for the first time, forcing it to fly back to mainland China.\n\nTensions between China and Taiwan have soared in recent months, especially in the lead up to and after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's August 2 trip to the democratic island, which Beijing has long claimed as its own. Her controversial visit came amid a slew of warnings from China that it would conduct military exercises in response.\n\nSince the visit, China has conducted war games near the island and repeatedly sent ships and jets into areas around Taiwan on a near-daily basis. Though Chinese warplanes routinely cross into Taiwan's air defense identification zone, they have as of late, been more regularly crossing the median line that divides the Taiwan Strait, a more provocative maneuver.\n\n\"Taiwan is a province of China and it does not have a \"defense ministry,\" Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said Wednesday in response to remarks by Taiwan's military. \"The act of the Taiwan authorities to heighten tensions does not mean anything.\"",

    "The Taiwan question and China’s peaceful reunification": "It is inherently created by universal natural law the composition of people of common history, language, identity and geography to be one people except divided by war, colonialism or Western influence. The Chinese are one people in all ramifications only historical obstructions that brought about the divide in geographical settling. Albeit in such obstructions, the Chinese government spares no efforts in making sure that the mainland China and the Strait of Taiwan become peacefully reunited, and this is a shared aspiration of all the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation.\n\nIt is indispensable for the realization of China’s rejuvenation. It is also a historic mission of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the government and the Chinese people. The emergence of President Xi Jinping at the core of the CPC and the 18th National Congress of the CPC in 2012, socialism with Chinese characteristics has been pioneered. The party and government of China have continued to chart the course of cross-Straits relations in order to safeguard peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits, and promote progress towards national reunification.\n\nIn its seriousness and commitment to peaceful reunification, the Chinese government has published two previous white papers on Taiwan. One was The Taiwan Question and Reunification of China in August 1993, and the other was The One-China Principle and the Taiwan Issue in February 2000. These white papers are pathfinders to a peaceful reunification using policies and principles that can guarantee the realization of such goals.To the ignorance of many, Taiwan is an independent state separate from China and some do not geographically know the location of Taiwan.\n\nThe basic or elementary lesson to this class of people is that, Taiwan has belonged to China since ancient times. This statement has a sound basis in history and jurisprudence. New archeological discoveries and research findings regularly attest to the profound historical and cultural ties between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits. A large number of historical records and annals document the development of Taiwan by the Chinese people in earlier periods.\n\nApart from the fact that starting from the Song and Yuan dynasties, the imperial central governments of China all set up administrative bodies to exercise jurisdiction over Penghu and Taiwan, General Zheng Chenggong led an expedition 1n 1662 to expel Dutch colonialists who invaded southern Taiwan. Historical records have it that the Qing court gradually set up more administrative bodies in Taiwan. In 1684, a Taiwan prefecture administration was set up under the jurisdiction of Fujian Province. In 1885, Taiwan’s status was upgraded and it became the 20th province of China.\n\nIt is also worth recalling that during the Chinese People’s War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression (1931-1945), China’s Communists called for the recovery of Taiwan after in July 1894 the Japanese launched a war of aggression against China. The Cairo Declaration issued by China, the United States and the United Kingdom on December 1, 1943 stated that it was the purpose of the three allies that all the territories Japan had stolen from China, such as Northeast China, Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, should be restored to China.\n\nThere are other international proclamations made and international consensus made by some great powers with China on the Taiwan Question. This reaffirms the Chinese ownership of the strait of Taiwan. The Potsdam Proclamation was signed by China, the United States and the United Kingdom on July 26, 1945, and subsequently recognized by the Soviet Union. It reiterated: “The terms of the Cairo Declaration shall be carried out.” In September of the same year, Japan signed the instrument of surrender, in which it promised that it would faithfully fulfill the obligations laid down in the Potsdam Proclamation.\n\nOn October 25 the Chinese government announced that it was resuming the exercise of sovereignty over Taiwan, and the ceremony to accept Japan’s surrender in Taiwan Province of the China war theater of the Allied powers was held in Taibei (Taipei). From that point forward, China had recovered Taiwan de jure and de facto through a host of documents with international legal effect.Having the mainland and Taiwan strait to be one China, On October 1, 1949, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) was founded, becoming the successor to the Republic of China (1912-1949), and the Central People’s Government became the only legitimate government of the whole of China. The new government replaced the previous KMT regime in a situation where China, as a subject under international law, did not change and China’s sovereignty and inherent territory did not change. As a natural result, the government of the PRC should enjoy and exercise China’s full sovereignty, which includes its sovereignty over Taiwan.\n\nThe United Nations was not left behind as it adopted resolutions in favor of China. At its 26th session in October 1971, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 2758, which undertook “to restore all its rights to the People’s Republic of China and to recognize the representatives of its Government as the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations, and to expel forthwith the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek from the place which they unlawfully occupied at the United Nations and in all the organizations related to it”.\n\nThis resolution settled once and for all the political, legal and procedural issues of China’s representation in the UN, and it covered the whole country, including Taiwan. It also spelled out that China has one single seat in the UN, so there is no such thing as “two Chinas” or “one China, one Taiwan”. The specialized agencies of the UN later adopted further resolutions restoring to the PRC its lawful seat and expelling the representatives of the Taiwan authorities. One of these is Resolution 25.1 adopted at the 25th World Health Assembly in May 1972.\n\nIt was clearly stated in the official legal opinions of the Office of Legal Affairs of the UN Secretariat that “the United Nations considers ‘Taiwan’ as a province of China with no separate status”, and the “‘authorities’ in ‘Taipei’ are not considered to… enjoy any form of government status”. At the UN the island is referred to as “Taiwan, Province of China.” Taiwan being under China, is not allowed to carry out independent international activities apart from cultural and business engagement, which all other provinces of China are allowed to.\n\nResolution 2758 is a political document encapsulating the one-China principle whose legal authority leaves no room for doubt and has been acknowledged worldwide. Taiwan does not have any ground, reason, or right to join the UN, or any other international organization whose membership is confined to sovereign states.Due to one reason or the other, the United States is breaching the principle of the one China policy especially by allowing Nancy Pelosy and other American politicians to visit Taiwan. This is double standard and provocative.\n\nThe one-China principle represents the universal consensus of the international community; it is consistent with the basic norms of international relations. To date, 181 countries including the United States have established diplomatic relations with the PRC on the basis of the one-China principle. The China-US Joint Communique on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations, published in December 1978, states: “The Government of the United States of America acknowledges the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China.” It also states: “The United States of America recognizes the Government of the People’s Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China.\n\nWithin this context, the people of the United States will maintain cultural, commercial, and other unofficial relations with the people of Taiwan.”Since 1982, China has been committed to peaceful reunification with the strait of Taiwan. The Constitution of the People’s Republic of China, adopted at the Fifth Session of the Fifth National People’s Congress (NPC) in December 1982, stipulates: “Taiwan is part of the sacred territory of the People’s Republic of China. It is the inviolable duty of all Chinese people, including our compatriots in Taiwan, to accomplish the great task of reunifying the motherland.” The Anti-Secession Law, adopted at the Third Session of the 10th NPC in March 2005, stipulates: “There is only one China in the world. Both the mainland and Taiwan belong to one China. China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity brook no division. Safeguarding China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity is the common obligation of all Chinese people, the Taiwan compatriots included.\n\nTaiwan is part of China. The state shall never allow the ‘Taiwan independence’ secessionist forces to make Taiwan secede from China under any name or by any means.”The National Security Law, adopted at the 15th meeting of the Standing Committee of the 12th NPC in July 2015, stipulates: “The sovereignty and territorial integrity of China brook no violation or separation. Safeguarding national sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity is the common duty of all Chinese citizens, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan compatriots.” Following the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee in 1978, with the establishment of diplomatic relations between the PRC and the United States, China’s Communists, led by Deng Xiaoping, defined the fundamental guideline for peaceful reunification in the vital interests of the country and the people and on the basis of the consensus for peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question. After the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee in 1989, China’s Communists, led by Jiang Zemin, made eight proposals for the development of cross-Straits relations and the peaceful reunification of China.It is also notable the perpetual Chinese leaders’ efforts at peaceful reunification.\n\nAfter the 16th CPC National Congress in 2002, China’s Communists, led by Hu Jintao, highlighted the importance of peaceful development of cross-Straits relations. The CPC pushed for the enactment of the Anti-Secession Law to curb separatist activities in Taiwan, hosted the first talks between the leaders of the CPC and the Kuomintang in six decades since 1945, and defeated attempts by Chen Shui-bian to fabricate a legal basis for “independence. After the 18th CPC National Congress in 2012, China’s Communists, under the leadership of Xi Jinping, took a holistic approach to cross-Straits relations in keeping with changing circumstances, added substance to the theory on national reunification and the principles and policies concerning Taiwan, and worked to keep cross-Straits relations on the right track.\n\nThe CPC developed its overall policy for resolving the Taiwan question in the new era, and set out the overarching guideline and a program of action.Using all peaceful means by China to reunite is the fundamental principle and policy adopted to the whole process. By extension, China has also made it clear that: First, the one-China principle must be upheld, and no individual or force should be allowed to separate Taiwan from China; Second, it is imperative to strive for the wellbeing of all Chinese people, including those in Taiwan, and to realize the aspirations of all Chinese people for a better life; Third, we must follow the principles of freeing the mind, seeking truth from facts, maintaining the right political orientation, and breaking new ground, and defend the fundamental interests of the nation and the core interests of the state in formulating principles and policies on work related to Taiwan; Fourth, it is necessary to have the courage and skill to fight against any force that attempts to undermine China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity or stands in the way of its reunification; Fifth, extensive unity and solidarity must be upheld to mobilize all factors to fight against any force that would divide the country, and pool strengths to advance national reunification.\n\nThis shows that international influence or external interference in the Taiwan question cannot succeed, but prone to meeting the utter rejection of such by China in full force.Reunification is being seen as part of China’s national rejuvenation from the historical past and obstructions caused by historical antecedents. In the modern era from the mid-19th century, due to the aggression of Western powers and the decadence of feudal rule, China was gradually reduced to a semi-feudal, semi-colonial society, and went through a period of suffering worse than anything it had previously known.\n\nThe country endured intense humiliation, the people were subjected to great pain, and the Chinese civilization was plunged into darkness. Japan’s 50-year occupation of Taiwan epitomised this humiliation and inflicted agony on both sides of the Taiwan Straits. Reunification will not mean alienating Taiwan, but more blessings, harmony and development. Provided that China’s sovereignty, security and development interests are guaranteed, after reunification Taiwan will enjoy a high degree of autonomy as a special administrative region. Taiwan’s social system and its way of life will be fully respected, and the private property, religious beliefs, and lawful rights and interests of the people in Taiwan will be fully protected.\n\nAll Taiwan compatriots who support reunification of the country and rejuvenation of the nation will be the masters of the region, contributing to and benefitting from China’s development. With a powerful motherland in support, the people of Taiwan will enjoy greater security and dignity and stand upright and rock-solid in the international community.The international community should try as much as possible to support China in achieving peaceful reunification and national rejuvenation for development, not to issue threats, polarisation and continued attempt to sabotage the efforts of China in this cause. Supporting China will mean support to international peace and security and anything short of that means disharmony and a move to create global insecurity and instability.\n\nIbrahim writes from the Department of Political Science and International Relations, University of Abuja via [email protected]\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",
    "Analysis of Concept Construction and Scale Development of Employee Zhe": "Introduction\n\nWhether in developed countries or developing countries, family firms are surviving and developing tenaciously. Due to the influence of traditional culture, Chinese family firms are more susceptible to the psychological influence of “insiders” and “outsiders” and adopt different treatment methods for different employees.1 Leadership has long been considered a critical factor in achieving team and organizational goals.2 Leadership style affects and guides the choice of employee behaviour and significantly impacts the survival and development of enterprises.3\n\nPrevious studies have shown that the particularism or rule by man in Chinese culture urges leaders to give more favouritism to their preferred subordinates and adopt different leadership behaviours.4 This unique leadership style is called differential leadership, which is particularly common in family firms.5 Many scholars believe that this leadership style is rooted in Confucian thought and Legalist thought in Chinese traditional culture. It has a unique role in management practice and a profound impact on the operation of Chinese family firms.6 Differential leadership divides employees into “insiders” and “outsiders”. “Insiders” refers to the employees seeking favour from their managers and becoming favoured subordinates, while “outsiders” do not do such things. Then, the former are seen as those with high performance and job satisfaction. As a result, the differential treatment by leaders results in uneven resource distribution, leading team members to compete to improve their status by seeking favour from their leaders.\n\nHuang,7 a scholar from Taiwan Province, put forward the concept of zhengchong behaviour to explore such interactive behaviour among employees and defined zhengchong behaviour as the phenomenon in which employees fawn on leaders and woo or crowd out colleagues to gain the favour of leaders. “Competing” is purposeful behaviour, while “favour” refers to the gifts and attention from leaders to employees. To compete for resources or rights, employees adopt different strategies in the process of zhengchong, which may not only promote the improvement of their own or team performance but also lead to the depletion of internal resources. Take the family firm “True Kung Fu” as an example (the leading enterprise in China’s fast-food industry); the struggle between “insiders” caused by “defamiliarization” has led to poor business management.8–10 In contrast, “Fangtai” (a well-known kitchenware brand in China), as a typical successful representative of a family firm, adheres to the management concept of meritocracy and continues to promote the enthusiasm of all employees.11 For enterprises, the organizational phenomenon of zhengchong behaviour has a significant impact on their long-term development, especially in the atmosphere of differential leadership. The in-depth discussion of zhengchong behaviour is of great significance.\n\nSome scholars in Taiwan Province have explored the connotation and structural elements based on Taiwan’s local enterprises with qualitative analysis, such as Huang7 and Huang,12 providing results with reference significance. However, given the geographical differences and different research paradigms, the existing research on the dimensions of employee zhengchong behaviour has more powerful subjectivity and insufficient systematicity, and there is a lack of accurate measurement scales.7 In addition, the lack of research on employee zhengchong behavior throughout the Chinese mainland also limits the development of related fields of study. Thus, identifying the dimensions of employee zhengchong under differential leadership as well as developing a zhengchong scale based on empirical measurement can enrich the current research and contribute significantly to the Chinese study of management style, which plays an essential role in guiding the development of enterprises.\n\nThe study is organized as follows. The researchers summarize the related literature in the Conceptual Analysis section. The researchers introduce the conceptual model construction of employee zhengchong behaviour in detail based on the qualitative research method of grounded theory in the Exploratory Research on the Structural Dimension of Employee Zhengchong Behaviour section. The researchers verify the dimensions developed by exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis in the Conceptual Constructs of Employee Zhengchong Behaviour section. The researchers offer a discussion of their theoretical contributions and practical enlightenments and conclude the paper in the Discussion and Conclusion sections.\n\nConceptual Analysis\n\nThe Connotation of Employee Zhengchong Behaviour\n\nWhen the word “zhengchong” is mentioned, a corresponding scene occurs to most of us, which indicates that zhengchong is not uncommon in real life. What is “zhengchong”? Before 2009, no scholar specifically mentioned the concept of “striving for a favour”, but related research has paved its way. Some studies have pointed out that leaders tend to rule by man, so managers are influenced by human feelings or relationships when making decisions. At the same time, subordinates try to cater to the wants and preferences of their leaders and are eager to obtain available resources from their managers and satisfy their personal needs. In the scope of organizational behaviour research, some scholars have pointed out the concepts of ingratiation and political skill behaviour,5 which is similar to the concept of rivalry. Ingratiation is a strategic behaviour to influence specific others and increase their attraction to the target. Political skill behaviour is a process of exerting social influence. Through political behaviour, short-term or long-term personal interests are maximized, sometimes consistent with others and sometimes in conflict.13 Huang first produced the concept of zhengchong behaviour in 2009 and defined it as an action taken by subordinates to improve their position in their supervisor’s mind. It is pointed out that “favour” is a resource that refers to the position of employees in the leader’s heart in enterprises.12,14,15 When employees flatter leaders, the primary purpose is to gain the leaders’ “pampering”. Therefore, “zhengchong behaviour” can be defined as subordinates’ “flattery”, “infighting”, or “collaboration” of horizontal relationships to gain the leaders’ favour. Compared with ingratiation and political skill behaviour, the goal of zhengchong behaviour is more clearly aimed at flattering leaders and uniting or marginalizing colleagues.\n\nDimension Division of Employee Zhengchong Behaviour\n\nConsidering the division of the dimension of zhengchong behaviour, Huang7 pointed out that the phenomenon of zhengchong behaviour can be divided into “flattery to supervisors” and “cocompetition with colleagues” and conducted an exploratory analysis with grounded theory. In the process of zhengchong behaviour, the leading interactive objects of zhengchong behaviour are their leaders, imaginary enemies, and outsiders, and the interaction with the competition for favour and leaders is manifested in close relationships, loyalty, and talent. The interaction between favoured employees and imaginary enemies is characterized by hostile exclusion, relational attacks, and competition over collaboration. The interaction between favoured employees and outsiders is characterized by attachment, strategic alliances, and collaboration between competitors. On this basis, Huang12 further divided competition behaviour into four main dimensions: pleasing leaders and showing off, flattering and serving, suppressing competitors, and uniting others among enterprises in Taiwan Province.\n\nAlthough there are some variations in the manifestation of employee zhengchong behaviour, the available research focuses primarily on two aspects: “flattering leaders” and “competing with colleagues.” Furthermore, in terms of the geographical breadth of the research, the extant literature is primarily focused on Taiwan Province. In addition, the majority of research on the components of employee zhengchong behaviour is qualitative, there is no consistent and authoritative scale for assessing employee zhengchong behaviour, and there is a dearth of relevant research on mainland China.\n\nConceptual Constructs of Employee Zhengchong Behaviour\n\nResearch Methods\n\nGrounded theory aims to probe the core concepts reflecting social phenomena and the relationships between concepts through coding and establishing theories based on primary data. It is a bottom-up inductive research method. By coding and analysing the data from multiple sources, the researchers can gradually sum up the explanation of the research phenomenon and develop the foundation of theoretical construction, which is especially suitable for exploratory research in newer fields.16 At present, there is little literature defining “employee zhengchong behaviour”, and the measurement of employee zhengchong behaviour has not yet formed a unified and mature scale. Therefore, this study, based on in-depth interviews, collects and summarizes a large number of interview materials and, on this basis, makes a systematic analysis of “employee zhengchong behaviour”. This research problem belongs to “exploratory research”, which is consistent with the function and essence of grounded theory. The application process of grounded theory mainly includes open coding, axial coding, selective coding and theory saturation testing.\n\nSample Selection\n\nEmployee zhengchong behaviour is manifested as a process interaction among employees or between leaders and employees. It is necessary to obtain research materials from the perspectives of multiple subjects when deconstructing the concept. Therefore, this study obtained interview data through in-depth interviews with multiple subjects, including employees and leaders, when selecting the sample. Meanwhile, considering that the human resource manager (HRM) is the core manager of staff management who has deeper insight into employee zhengchong behaviour, this study also took HRMs as the interview subjects to form an employee–leader–HRM triangle chain of evidence.\n\nAfter identifying the interviewees, this study, based on sample accessibility and representativeness principles, selected 20 family firms in Jiangsu Province for interviews. The researchers selected these firms for two reasons: first, due to geographical restrictions and the epidemic, the researchers could select only surrounding cities for their research; second, Jiangsu, as one of the more developed provinces in China, has gathered a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises, so the region was able to meet our sample needs. The sample firms came from various industries, including manufacturing, service, and IT, and the size of the firms varied, further enhancing the study’s comprehensiveness. Twenty-two employees, 20 leaders, and 20 HRMs were interviewed. The 62 interviewees were coded in sequence. For example, the researchers interviewed one employee, his leader, and one HR manager of a company in Nanjing. Then, the researchers coded them as A1, A2, and A3 in turn.\n\nMoreover, the researchers coded each of the 62 interviewees individually. Interviewees from the same company were coded. Respondents from the same firm were coded with the same letter and different numbers.\n\nBefore the interview, it was necessary to draw up an interview outline. The questions in the outline mainly included “What do you think employee zhengchong is?”, “What are the specific behaviours of employee zhengchong (self-expression to leaders, colleagues, etc.)?”, “How do you view employee zhengchong behaviour (positive/negative, right business impact, impact employees)?” and so on. During the interview process, the semistructured interviews were mainly conducted around the proposed outline. After asking for the interviewer’s consent, the researchers recorded the interviews during the whole process. Then, the recorded information was converted into text information in a word-for-word draft, which laid the foundation for the coding analysis, model building, and theoretical saturation testing.\n\nResults of the Concept Construction\n\nThis study borrows Chen’s practice and carries out data analysis following the steps of open coding, spindle coding, and selective coding.17\n\nOpen Coding\n\nIn applying grounded theory, open coding means that researchers arrange interview records, analyse and summarize these records, and finally sum up the corresponding categories. When gathering and analysing the collected data, researchers must maintain a rational and scientific attitude, seek truths from facts, and reject the influence of subjective consciousness on the original data to the greatest extent, so the original words of interviewees should be used as much as possible. This study retrieved 1800 original sentences and associated concepts using frequency statistics and the encoded interview materials. It was determined that 1480 original sentences and their related concepts could be retrieved after discussing and revising coding errors among different staff members. On this basis, further classification and integration were made, and the initial concepts that appeared more than three times were selected. In this paper, 24 initial concepts and 12 initial categories were obtained. This paper presents 41 typical representative original sentences, as shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1 Examples of Interview Records and Open Coding\n\nSpindle Coding\n\nSpindle coding is a further analysis of the initial concepts and categories. It tries to find the logical relationships between categories and then sums up the main categories. After many discussions and analyses produced by the research group, 24 original concepts and 12 initial categories of open coding were classified, and four main categories were obtained, namely, showing abilities, collaborating and sharing, excluding outsiders, and ingratiating upwards, as shown in Table 2.\n\nTable 2 Spindle Coding\n\nSelective Coding\n\nSelective coding further analyses and abstracts the concept of the main category in the main axis coding to obtain the relationship between the core category and the main category and extract the related categories. The core category of this study is the competition behaviour of employees, and the main categories include showing abilities, collaborating and sharing, excluding outsiders, and ingratiating upwards. There is a causal relationship between the primary and core categories, thus forming the relationship structure between them.\n\nBased on grounded theory analysis, these two categories are further summarized as positive and negative zhengchong behaviours. Among them, the positive competition behaviours include showing abilities and collaborating and sharing, while the negative competition behaviours include excluding outsiders and ingratiating upwards, as shown in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1 Dimensions of employee Zhengchong behaviour.\n\nTheoretical Saturation Test\n\nGlaser thinks that theoretical saturation means that data are conceptualized and abstracted in categories continuously until new attributes cannot be obtained, so the concept density is produced.16\n\nTherefore, this paper randomly picked two employees of XS Company and ST Company from the list, repeating the open coding stages and initially extracting 120 original sentences and related concepts. For the open coding’s dependability, other scholars were encouraged to examine further and compress the original sentences and associated concepts, resulting in forty original sentences and associated concepts. After further classification and integration, the initial concepts with a frequency of more than two were selected, and the researchers obtained six initial concepts and three initial categories. The former involves improving efficiency, actively working, snitching, maliciously slandering, actively expressing, and exerting special skills, and the latter includes lean work, slandering and suppressing, and showing merits. Therefore, the proposed theoretical framework of employee zhengchong behaviour was verified, and no new main category was formed, which showed that the proposed theoretical model had passed the theoretical saturation test and had good theoretical saturation.\n\nScale Development of Employee Zhengchong Behaviour\n\nFirst, this study found four dimensions of employee zhengchong behaviour through grounded theory, including showing abilities, collaborating and sharing, excluding outsiders, and ingratiating upwards. Second, according to the connotation of each dimension, this study referred to the literature and developed and designed the measurement items that met the four dimensions of employee zhengchong behaviour.\n\nInitial Scale Generation\n\nIn the measurement of the “showing abilities” dimension, the researchers learned from the ingratiating upwards behaviour scale developed by Kumar and Beyerlein,18 the job performance scale developed by Janssen and Van Yperen,19 and the job performance scale verified and used in the organizational situation of Taiwan Province by Gong et al.20 In the measurement of the “collaborating and sharing” dimension, the researchers drew on the organizational citizenship behaviour scale developed by Farh et al,21 the organizational innovation climate scale developed by Wang and Chang,22 and the views on teamwork and team knowledge sharing proposed by Zhao et al23 and Wang and Ji.24 In the measurement of the “excluding outsiders” dimension, the researchers mainly profited from the employee competition behaviour scale developed by Huang,12 the workplace bullying scale developed by Einarsen et al,25 and the workplace exclusion scale developed by Ferris.26 In the measurement of the “ingratiating upwards” dimension, the researchers borrowed the dimensions of flattery service and echo performance in the employee competition behaviour scale developed by Huang,12 the ingratiating upwards behaviour scale developed by Kumar and Beyerlein,18 and the impression management scale developed by Bolino and Turnley.27\n\nBased on the interview corpus and mature scale items in China and abroad, this paper preliminarily designs the measurement items of the employee zhengchong behaviour scale, invites experts to evaluate whether the initial measurement items conform to the theoretical construction of the scale, adjusts the items with conflicting or overlapping contents following the experts’ suggestions, and rewrites and expands the items. Finally, a small number of 28 employees were invited to have a trial reading and a trial filling, and the opinions and ideas of the candidates were collected. After several rounds of repeated exchanges with experts in related fields, the initial scale of employee zhengchong behaviour was finally formed, as shown in Table 3. The items of showing abilities, collaborating and sharing, excluding outsiders, and ingratiating upwards are labelled as S1-S5, S6-S9, S10-S15, and S16-S20, respectively.\n\nTable 3 Initial Items of Employee Zhengchong Behaviour\n\nResults of the Scale Development\n\nExploratory Factor Analysis\n\nQuestionnaire Recovery and Sample Collection\n\nTo apply exploratory factor analysis to confirm the items and conceptual structure of the employee zhengchong behaviour scale, a questionnaire was designed, and the first questionnaire survey was conducted. The Likert 5-point scale was adopted. The survey chose a professional platform for the data collection questionnaire survey, and the sample selection was mainly based on two standards. The samples were located in Jiangsu Province, and the samples were all family firms.\n\nFrom September to October 2020, 320 questionnaires were randomly distributed and recovered. After eliminating invalid questionnaires, 278 valid questionnaires were obtained, and the effective questionnaire recovery rate was 86.88%. The survey’s analysis results of demographic variables are shown in Table 4. Among the 278 subjects, the ratio of males to females was similar, with 129 males (46.4%) and 149 females (53.6%). The age distribution was relatively wide, among which the 26- to 30-year-old cohort was the most common, accounting for 131 participants (47.1%), followed by the 31- to 35-year-old cohort, with 95 people (34.2%); more than half of the participants finished undergraduate college, with 230 people (82.7%); and 132 people had worked in the company for more than 5 years, accounting for 47.5%.\n\nTable 4 Characteristics of Participants in Exploratory Factor Analysis\n\nReliability Test and Project Purification\n\nPreliminary reliability testing of the scale and item purification were carried out before exploratory component analysis of the data was performed, with Cronbach’s coefficient and CITC values of each item being examined to judge internal consistency and single-overall correlation. As shown in Table 5, the total Cronbach’s coefficient of the 20 items in the initial scale of employee zhengchong behaviour is 0.907, and the CITC values of the 20 items and the results of the α coefficient after deleting items are shown in Table 6. According to the experience standard, items with an α coefficient greater than 0.6 and a CITC index not less than 0.5 should be retained. The CITC index of Items S2, S14, and S20 are lower than 0.5, and the total α coefficient of the scale is improved after the deletion of Items S2 and S14, but the total α coefficient of the scale is unchanged after the deletion of Item S20. After a comprehensive investigation, Items S2, S14, and S20 are deleted based on simplifying the scale.\n\nTable 5 Results of the Internal Consistency Reliability Test of the Zhengchong Behaviour Scale\n\nTable 6 Results of Exploratory Factor Analysis of Employee Zhengchong Behaviour\n\nExploratory Factor Analysis\n\nFirst, the applicability of exploratory factor analysis was tested on the sample data. With the help of SPSS software, the KMO and Bartlett’s test of the sample data were carried out, and the results showed that the KMO value was 0.876, which exceeded the critical empirical value of 0.7, indicating that there were many common factors in the sample data. The χ2 value of Bartlett’s test is 2929.005, which is significant (p<0.001), indicating common factors among the correlation matrices of the data. In conclusion, the sample data can be used for the subsequent factor analysis.\n\nSecond, according to Floyd & Widaman’s suggestions,28 the principal component method extracts By removing items that do not meet the relevant standards, a factor structure with significant theoretical significance and value can be obtained. Items are screened according to three main criteria: first, items must have a high load value on a specific factor; second, items must not have a high cross load on different factors; third, items must have a consistent connotation under a given factor. Based on factor analysis, item S5 has a high cross load across two factors, and this is contrary to the connotations of other items in the main factors, so it is necessary to delete this item and run factor analysis again. According to the four dimensions of employee zhengchong behavior, four factors are eventually extracted following the continuous factor analysis. A 73.949% contribution rate from the four factors is ideal for the total variance. In Table 6, 16 entries are retained, and their load on the factor to which they belong is greater than 0.50, with small crossloads in other dimensions, forming a robust factor structure. According to the prior research, the four factors are showing abilities, collaborating and sharing, excluding outsiders, and ingratiating upwards.\n\nConfirmatory Factor Analysis\n\nQuestionnaire Recovery and Sample Collection\n\nConfirmatory factor analysis was carried out on the items and conceptual structure of the employee zhengchong behaviour measurement scale. A second questionnaire was designed, and the second questionnaire survey was conducted. The Likert 5-point scale was adopted. This survey also used the online anonymous survey platform. The research samples came from private enterprises in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai, Guangdong, Beijing, and other places and were widely distributed. From November 2020 to January 2021, 380 questionnaires were randomly distributed, and 380 questionnaires were recovered. After eliminating invalid questionnaires, 331 valid questionnaires were obtained, and the recovery rate of valid questionnaires was 87.11%. The analysis results of the demographic variables of the survey samples are shown in Table 7. Among the 331 subjects, the ratio of males to females was similar, with 162 males (48.9%) and 169 females (51.1%). The age distribution was relatively wide, among which the 26- to 30-year-old cohort was the most common, accounting for 182 participants (55.0%), followed by 31- to 35-year-old cohort, with 96 people (29.0%); more than half of the participants finished undergraduate college, with 273 people (82.5%); and 141 people had worked in the company for more than 5 years, accounting for 42.6%.\n\nTable 7 Characteristics of Participants in Confirmatory Factor Analysis\n\nFirst-Order Confirmatory Factor Analysis\n\nIn this study, the structural equation model is built with the help of Amos 21.0 software to conduct confirmatory factor analysis on the sample data. The fitting situation of each nested model is shown in Table 8. Among the fitting index options, the fitting index of the four-factor model is best. It can be considered that the fitting index of the four-factor model has reached an ideal level, which shows that the four dimensions of showing abilities, collaborating and sharing, excluding outsiders, and ingratiating upwards have good distinguishing validity. The structure of the four-factor model is reasonable.\n\nTable 8 Results of Confirmatory Factor Analysis of Employee Zhengchong Behaviour\n\nThe factor loading of the four-factor structural equation model is shown in Figure 2. From the figure, the standardized load coefficients of all the measurement items of employee zhengchong behaviour on the corresponding latent variables are higher than 0.5, and all of them pass the t test, which is significant at the level of p<0.001. This shows that the variables in this study have good aggregation validity and further verifies the rationality of the four-dimensional structure.\n\nFigure 2 Parameter estimation of the 4-factor structural model of employee Zhengchong behaviour. Abbreviations: SA, showing abilities; CS, collaborating and sharing; EO, excluding outsiders; IU, ingratiating upwards. The same below.\n\nSecond-Order Confirmatory Factor Analysis\n\nThe second-order model test results are shown in Figure 3. The path coefficients of the 4 dimensions, namely, showing abilities, collaborating and sharing, excluding outsiders, and ingratiating upwards, are all higher than the critical value of 0.7. Therefore, the researchers can consider that the inherent quality fitting degree of the second-order structural equation model of employee zhengchong behaviour is acceptable, and the four dimensions can better reflect the actual level of zhengchong behaviour.\n\nFigure 3 The results of second order confirmatory factor analysis of employee Zhengchong behaviour scale.\n\nIn addition, each fitting index of the second-order structural model also reached the ideal level: χ2/df=1.580, RMSEA=0.037, GFI=0.964, PGFI=0.670, NFI=0.958, TLI=0.980, and CFI=0.984 (see Table 9). In summary, it can be concluded that the hypothesized four dimensions (showing abilities, collaborating and sharing, excluding outsiders, and ingratiating upwards) can better converge to the higher concept of employee zhengchong behaviour.\n\nTable 9 Reliability Coefficient of Employee Zhengchong Behaviour Scale\n\nReliability and Validity Test of the Scale\n\nReliability Test\n\nTo analyse the reliability of the conceptual framework of employee zhengchong behaviour, the 331 valid sample data from the second survey were used to analyse the reliability of the 16 questions in the four dimensions, primarily by calculating each dimension’s Cronbach’s coefficient. According to common practice, Cronbach’s α coefficient of the scale is above 0.7, which signifies good reliability. As shown in Table 9, Cronbach’s α coefficients of the four dimensions of employee zhengchong behaviour are all more significant than 0.7, and the total Cronbach’s α coefficient of the scale is 0.916, which indicates that the scale has good reliability.\n\nValidity Test\n\nFrom the point of view of content validity, the generation of the employee zhengchong behaviour measurement scale in this study is based on extensive literature research and rooted in the analysis of interview data. After the first draft of the questionnaire was formed, aiming to make the measurement items more complete and targeted, relevant experts were invited to demonstrate and modify the expression of the items repeatedly, and employees were invited to try to fill in the feedback. Moreover, the initial questionnaire was formed through continuous modification and improvement. Meanwhile, many widely distributed sample data were randomly collected, and inappropriate items were further deleted by quantitative analysis. Therefore, judged on rationality, the content validity of the constructed employee zhengchong behaviour scale was appropriate in this study.\n\nFrom the perspective of structural validity, the standardized load coefficients of the 16 items in the four dimensions of employee zhengchong behaviour are all higher than 0.5 (see Figure 3) and reach significant levels. The calculated average variance extracted (AVE) and composite reliability (CR) are shown in Table 10. The AVE values and CR values of the four factors of showing abilities, collaborating and sharing, excluding outsiders, and ingratiating upwards are all higher than 0.5 and 0.7, so it can be considered that the four-dimensional structure of employee zhengchong behaviour has good convergence validity. Table 11 shows the correlation coefficients among the four dimensions of employee zhengchong behaviour in this study. The maximum correlation coefficient is 0.556, far less than 0.85, which meets the standard, and each correlation coefficient among the four dimensions is less than the square root of the corresponding AVE. Therefore, the four dimensions of employee zhengchong behaviour have good discriminant validity. In summary, it can be concluded that the four-dimensional structure of employee zhengchong behaviour constructed in this study has good discriminant validity.\n\nTable 10 Convergence Validity Analysis of Employee Zhengchong Behaviour Scale\n\nTable 11 Discriminatory Validity Analysis of Employee Zhengchong Behaviour Scale\n\nResearch Discussion and Conclusions\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this study, the researchers innovatively divide employee zhengchong behaviour into four specific dimensions, both positive and negative. Huang7 defined “zhengchong” as subordinates’ flattery, infighting, or collaboration of horizontal relationships to gain the leaders’ favour. Huang12 further divided zhengchong behaviour into four main dimensions: pleasing leaders and showing off, flattering and serving, suppressing competitors, and uniting others among enterprises. The above definition of “zhengchong” has a specific pejorative emotional colour. However, from the viewpoint of enterprise management practice, employee zhengchong behaviour does not contain only negative aspects. This paper divides zhengchong behaviour into four positive and negative dimensions based on in-depth interviews and ground theory. Positive zhengchong behaviour includes demonstrating abilities, collaborating, and sharing, while negative zhengchong behaviour includes excluding outsiders and ingratiating upwards.\n\nFurthermore, this study developed a measurement scale of “employee zhengchong”. The researchers strictly followed the development steps of the scale and, based on exploratory factor analysis, constructed a 4-dimensional employee zhengchong behavior index system with 16 items, and passed the reliability test, which showed the items in each core category of the scale had a good consistency. Confirmatory factor analysis proved that the 4-dimensional structure of employee zhengchong behavior was the best. Combined reliability and mean-variance AVE method proved that the scale had good discrimination validity, conceptual validity and aggregation validity.\n\nTheoretical Implications\n\nCompared with previous studies, this study defines employee zhengchong behaviour more objectively and comprehensively, which provides a theoretical basis for further study of employee zhengchong behaviour and expands the relevant theoretical research on employee behaviour. In addition, this study innovatively develops the employee zhengchong behaviour scale. It provides an effective measurement tool for the quantitative research of “employee zhengchong behaviour.” The development of the employee zhengchong behaviour scale can offset the shortcomings of previous quantitative research on the role of employee zhengchong behaviour, promote the transformation of employee zhengchong behaviour from conceptual discussion to empirical analysis, and provide the possibility for further research on the mechanism of employee zhengchong behaviour.\n\nPractical Implications\n\nThis study has important implications for enterprise practice; the following vital enlightenments are obtained:\n\nThis study has deepened the understanding of enterprise managers on employee zhengchong behaviour and enabled them to form a more profound and more comprehensive cognition of “employee zhengchong behaviour.” The exploration of the structural dimension of employee zhengchong behaviour clarifies for leaders the basic content of each dimension of employee zhengchong behaviour, which can be used to guide leaders in piloting employees’ positive zhengchong behaviour in different dimensions and restraining employees’ negative zhengchong behaviour, thereby enhancing employees’ efficiency and laying foundations for the sustainable development of enterprises.\n\nConclusions\n\nBased on the definitions of zhengchong by Taiwan scholars Huang Rui-xiang and Huang Guo-zhan, this study adopts the ground theory approach and conducts a pioneering in-depth study on employee zhengchong behaviour in the family firms of mainland China. This study focuses on the concept and measurement of employee zhengchong behaviour. For the concept of employee zhengchong behaviour, the structural dimensions are constructed, and then a corresponding scale for measuring employee zhengchong behaviour is developed. Furthermore, the clarification of the concept of employee zhengchong behaviour and the development of the scale in this paper provide not only a reference for further research but also important directions for family firm leaders to better apply differential management practices to promote positive employee attitudes and thus improve firm performance.",
    "Continuing Resumed Session, Non-Governmental Organizations Committee Recommends Consultative Status to 46 Entities, Defers Action on 85 Others": "During its resumed 2022 session today, the Committee on Non-Governmental Organizations recommended that the Economic and Social Council grant special consultative status to 46 entities, while deferring action on 85 others — with delegates requesting that they provide additional information on their financial statements, present or past activities, or guarantees of how they maintain independence when using Government funds.\n\nThe 19-member Committee considers applications for consultative status and requests for reclassification submitted by non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Once an application has been reviewed and approved by the Committee, it is considered recommended for consultative status. Organizations which were granted general and special status can attend meetings of the Council and issue statements, while those with general status can also speak during meetings and propose agenda items. Organizations with roster status can only attend meetings.\n\nAmong those NGOs recommended for special consultative status included were a number that work to promote the rights of vulnerable populations and groups. Images For Inclusion Inc., created in 2017 and based in the United States, undertakes the mission to combine photography and philanthropy to benefit of children, women and vulnerable indigenous peoples who suffer from material deprivation and limited social participation. It strives to visually expose their socioeconomic, cultural and political disadvantages through photo exhibitions, and provides them with opportunities and resources to promote their social inclusion.\n\nAnother group recommended was the National Ethnic Disability Alliance (Australia), which aims to advance and protect the interests and human rights of persons with disabilities among asylum-seekers, migrants and refugees. Created in 1995, the organization also aims to contribute to the work of Council and its subsidiary bodies by implementing the Sustainable Development Goals in Australia, focusing on the development of its particular focus group: people with disabilities from immigrant backgrounds who are most often in the grip of poverty.\n\nLanka Fundamental Rights Organization (Sri Lanka), created in 2018, works to help children who cannot go to school due to financial difficulties, as well as those who are bullied. It further promotes health education, organizes medical camps and assists communities in preserving drinking groundwater, while ensuring adequate transport for children and elders. In addition, the NGO intends to ensure the planting of one million trees and to support the creation of social enterprises.\n\nThe Committee can recommend three different consultative statuses to the Council: general, special and roster.\n\nGeneral status is reserved for large international NGOs whose fields of activity cover the majority of activities in the Council agenda, and its subsidiary bodies. These NGOs are authorized to submit written communications and petitions to the Council, and to propose the inclusion of items on the agenda. Special consultative status is granted to organizations working in a specific field and authorizes them to submit written communications and petitions. Roster status is accorded to NGOs working in a more technical and/or restricted way.\n\nThe Committee will continue the work of its resumed session at 10 a.m. on Wednesday, 31 August.\n\nSpecial Consultative Status\n\nThe Committee on Non-Governmental Organizations recommended that the Economic and Social Council grant special consultative status to the following entities:\n\nImages For Inclusion Inc (United States);\n\nInner Trip Reiyukai International (United States);\n\nInstituto Internacional de Derecho y Medio Ambiente/International Institute for Law and the Environment (Spain);\n\nInternational Assembly of Roma (United States);\n\nInterpol Center (United Kingdom);\n\nJacobs-Abbey Global Institute for Leadership Studies Inc.

    "US-China experts warn of 'bloody affair for both sides' if war were to start": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nAny conflict between the U.S. and China would prove costly for both sides and resolve based on a few key points – and not necessarily in America’s favor, defense experts told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"If you were to rank them, I would put Taiwan first, South China Sea second, the Senkaku Islands third and then elsewhere in the world,\" James Anderson, the acting Under Secretary of Defense for Policy during the Trump Administration, said, adding that the Sea of Japan could also serve as the flashpoint for conflict with China.\n\nPresident Biden, in May, reiterated this stance when he told a reporter that defending Taiwan, even militarily, was \"the commitment we made.\"\n\nFox News Digital spoke with former defense officials and experts.\n\nUN HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL WEIGHS ACCUSING CHINA OF ‘CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY’\n\nProximity to China would provide Beijing a significant advantage, similar to how Russia saw a swing in momentum during its Ukraine invasion once it shortened its supply lines to focus only on the territories just beyond its western border in the Donbas region.\n\nPUTIN, XI TO MEET FACE TO FACE NEXT WEEK IN FIRST MEETING SINCE WAR IN UKRAINE\n\n\"The problem is that in the Indo-Pacific Theater, the closer you get to China, the more [China] can concentrate its military assets,\" Anderson explained. \"What is especially concerning to the United States and its allies are ballistic missiles and the fact that China is probably ahead of us with hypersonic weaponry,\" which could allow China to hit jet carriers and other surface ships hard and fast.\n\nEven with that advantage though, China faces a significant conflict that Dr. John Lee, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and former Senior National Security Advisor to Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, said would prove \"a very bloody affair for both sides.\"\n\n\"Over the past two decades, the U.S. and allies have been very passive, allowing the People’s Liberation Army to achieve air and sea dominance in this theater,\" Lee said. \"However, [they] are now becoming serious about developing long-range strike capabilities, hypersonic strike capabilities, asymmetrical capabilities … and the range of non-military measures which would include crippling economic and financial sanctions.\"\n\n\"In short, the U.S. and allies have many good and powerful options to ensure the military and strategic balance is in their favor,\" he added.\n\nSENATE COMMITTEE TO MEET THIS WEEK OVER BIPARTISAN TAIWAN DEFENSE BILL\n\nAnderson also touted the U.S. military’s ability to counter missiles. However, that capability loses impact in the face of \"saturation attacks,\" which effectively aim to blanket a target with missiles and stretch defensive efforts.\n\nThe U.S. has, therefore, also focused on trying to strengthen Taiwan through the \"porcupine strategy,\" which would see nations supply the island nation with a large amount of anti-tank and anti-air weaponry to help close the gap in military superiority that China holds.\n\nChina holds a manpower advantage over the U.S., with China’s 2.8 million soldier army outranking the U.S. alone, according to Brookings Institution, but a naval and air combat operation would severely limit that advantage.\n\n\"At this stage, China has air and sea dominance over the Taiwan Strait but cannot land troops successfully on Taiwan,\" Lee said. \"If it achieves the capacity to do so, then China will see the military option as a more attractive one.\"\n\nPUTIN SAYS THE US AND WEST ARE FAILING, CLAIMS FUTURE LIES IN ASIA\n\nMatt McInnis, of the Institute for the Study of War, noted that China’s goal will largely dictate its coordination and deployment: Any attempt to secure islands in the contested seas and straits would likely choke point the Chinese forces, leaving limited use for troop deployments.\n\n\"Depending on your objectives and what they aim to achieve through naval and air forces, you would potentially have some use for Marines to hold certain smaller pieces of territory and some smaller islands,\" McInnis said, adding that Beijing would only proceed with an invasion once it felt reasonably confident American forces could not deploy quickly enough to the region.\n\nAnderson noted that China has closed the gap in other military domains, but has not yet overtaken the U.S., acknowledging that China has \"the largest number of ships in the world today,\" but that the U.S. still has the advantage in terms of quality, and the same holds true for a \"superior\" U.S. Air Force.\n\nThe U.S. also can rely on regional partners. China, on the other hand, has few allies to turn to, largely looking toward countries like Russia to help it \"deflect\" economic pressure that the U.S. and its allies, according to McInnis.\n\nPENTAGON PAUSES F-35 DELIVERIES AFTER DISCOVERING JET COMPONENTS CAME FROM CHINA\n\n\"There will certainly be economic lines of effort … and I'm quite sure China is looking long-term at how Russia, as well as key energy suppliers like Iran, can help them manage economic fallout from a conflict with the United States,\" he said. \"But I don't think we're at the point in the relationship between countries, certainly including North Korea, where they would necessarily provide operational support or lethal aid directly to China.\"\n\nLee believes that China’s position weakened since it tipped its hand and revealed \"broader intentions\" to \"dominate East Asia,\" a move that also has emboldened the U.S. and its allies to ensure they counter China’s ambitions.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"China seeks to prevail by convincing the US and allies that it is not ‘worth it’ to defend Taiwan, that the cost would be too great,\" he said. \"China’s problem is that it has revealed its broader intentions, which is to dominate East Asia: Hence, a successful Chinese seizure of Taiwan would embolden China to push further rather than lead to a more satisfied power.\"",
    "Xi Focus: Chinese President and the Revitalization of Northeast": "Stories by Aidoghie Paulinus\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping, has said the Government of the People’s Republic of China will give greater sense of responsibility and endeavours in the revitalization of China’s northeast region in the new era. Xi made the disclosure during his inspection tour of the Liaoning Province of China.\n\nXi, who doubles as the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and Chairman of the Central Military Commission, also advocated for the breaking of new ground in the revitalization and development of the north-eastern province. While calling for coordination of the COVID-19 response with economic and social development, Xi further made case for the balancing development and security imperatives, fully and faithfully implementing the new development philosophy, and firmly promoting high-quality development.\n\nAccording to Xi, “Efforts should be made to promote common prosperity for all, advance the modernization of China’s system and capacity for governance, and deepen the Party’s full and rigorous self-governance, to set the stage for the 20th National Congress of the CPC.”\n\nIn the course of the inspection, Xi was in the cities of Jinzhou and Shenyang where he visited several places, including a revolutionary memorial, a river and lake management project, an enterprise, and a community.\n\nOn Tuesday, afternoon of August 16th, Xi first visited the Liaoshen Campaign Memorial in Jinzhou City where he said the victory of the Liaoshen Campaign during the War of Liberation, more than 70 years ago, was achieved, thanks to the full support of the people in the northeast. He attributed the same feat to the victories of the Huaihai Campaign and the Crossing-the-Yangtze Campaign, both of which occurred during the War of Liberation.\n\nXi explained that no political consideration is more important than the people, even as he said that so long as the party maintains its ties with the people, breathes the same air as the people, shares the same destiny, and stays connected to them, it can obtain the power to triumph over any difficulty.\n\nDuring the visit, Xi met with veteran soldiers and comrades, and representatives of families and relatives of revolutionary martyrs. He noted that people in northeast China sacrificed a great deal for the success of the Liaoshen Campaign and the liberation of northeast China, and made massive contributions to the development of New China and the victory in the War to Resist the United States Aggression and Aid Korea, saying that this would never be forgotten by the party and the Chinese people.\n\n“We will never allow our socialist country to change its nature. Nor will the people,” Xi declared, even as he told party committees and governments at all levels to care about veteran soldiers and comrades, and families and relatives of revolutionary martyrs.\n\nAlong the line, Xi went to a forest park in Jinzhou to inspect local work on ecological restoration where he told the people that the concept of green development should be applied to ecological conservation, environmental improvement, production and manufacturing, the development of cities, the people’s lives, and other aspects to expedite the building of a beautiful China.\n\nXi was briefed on the flood control efforts of the province, where heavy rainfalls in the summer wreaked havoc on farmland and people’s property and nearly 200,000 people were relocated. He noted that August remains a key month for the north to prevent floods and asked party committees and governments at all levels to continue putting people and their lives above anything else.\n\nHe admonished the people that efforts should be made to strengthen flood monitoring, ferret out risks and vulnerabilities, and take meticulous and tangible measures in flood control and relief, adding that appropriate arrangements should be made for those affected by floods to ensure their safety. At a square in Jinzhou, Xi told residents that the Chinese-style modernization features common prosperity for all, not just a few, which he said, also marked by balanced development of material and cultural-ethical progress.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Xi met with military officers above senior colonel level and major commanders of regiments in Shenyang and took a group photo with them before departure.\n\nState Councillor Wang Yi Elaborates on China’s Position on the Taiwan Question\n\nAt a press conference for Chinese and foreign media on August 5, 2022, specifically in the afternoon, local time, Chinese State Councillor and Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, held a press conference after attending the series of foreign ministers’ meetings on East Asia cooperation in Phnom Penh. Wang expressed his readiness to elaborate on China’s position on the Taiwan question, saying that given that the United States has just spread disinformation and falsehoods, it is even more important for China to clear the air and set the record straight with facts.\n\nHe pointed out that Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, in total disregard of the firm opposition and repeated representations of the Chinese side and with the condonement and even arrangement of the United States Government went ahead with the visit to China’s Taiwan region.\n\nAccording to Wang, “This reckless move seriously undermined China’s sovereignty, seriously interfered in China’s internal affairs, seriously violated the commitments made by the U.S. side, and seriously jeopardized peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. It is only natural that China makes a firm response. Our position is justified, reasonable and legal; our measures are firm, strong and measured; and our military exercises are open, transparent and professional. They are consistent with domestic and international laws, as well as international practices. They are aimed at sending a warning to the perpetrator and punishing the “Taiwan independence” forces. We will firmly safeguard China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, resolutely stop the United States’ attempt to use the Taiwan card to contain China, and firmly shatter the Taiwan authorities’ illusion to pursue Taiwan independence by soliciting the support of the United States.”\n\nWang also said because of the development, more than 100 countries have spoken out, reaffirming their firm commitment to the one-China policy and underscoring their understanding and support of China’s legitimate position.\n\nWang added: “UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, explicitly stressed that the UN remains committed to the UN General Assembly Resolution 2758. The centerpiece is the one-China principle, namely, there is but one China in the world, the government of the People’s Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China, and Taiwan is a part of China. This is the unified voice of justice of the international community.”\n\nEnvoys Visit Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region\n\nFrom August 1 to August 5, a delegation of diplomatic envoys posted in China from 30 Islamic countries, including Algeria, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, visited the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region upon invitation.\n\nThe delegation visited Kashgar, Aksu and Urumqi, and they visited mosques, Islamic institutes, grassroot communities, cotton fields and the former sites of vocational education centers, among others. They also visited Uyghur families, talked to local religious figures, toured an exhibition on counter-terrorism and de-radicalization, and saw with their own eyes that people from all ethnic backgrounds live in harmony, their freedom of religious belief are fully protected and breakthroughs have been made in poverty alleviation and rural revitalization, which is the true reality in Xinjiang.\n\nFOCAC Eight Ministerial Conference: China, Africa Reaffirm Unwavering Support\n\nThe Coordinators’ Meeting on he Implementation of the Follow-up Actions of the Eighth Ministerial Conference of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) hich concluded successfully n 8 August, 022, has reaffirmed unwavering support between China and Africa.\n\nBoth sides also reaffirmed their unwavering support to each other in upholding territorial integrity, sovereignty, security and development interests, and reaffirmed hat there is, but ne China in the world, Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory, and the Government of the People’s Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China.\n\nThe African side reaffirmed ts commitment to the one-China principle, and its support for China’s national reunification and China’s efforts to safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\nThe Chinese ide supported the 5th Ordinary Session of the African Union ssembly in adopting the Resolution on the Impact of Sanctions and Unilateral Coercive Measures on African Union Member States, strongly condemned the practice by any country to impose economic and political pressure on others through unilateral coercive measures, and urged or the ifting of the measures that iolate the purposes and principles of the United Nations harter.\n\nBoth sides agreed that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic posed serious challenge to global economic recovery and the implementation of FOCAC outcomes.

    "China's steady inroads in Arab world focuses on strategic sectors": "China is slowly but steadily expanding its presence across the Arab World and Israel away from public glare building partnerships in various sectors including petroleum, infrastructure, military, power, technology and media.There was an overwhelming support from the Arab world including some of US allies for One China Policy in the backdrop of Nancy Pelosi’s Taiwan trip. This is reflection of China’s growing support in various sectors in key countries in the region. Saudi Aramco and China’s state-owned SINOPEC last month signed an agreement for collaboration in the oil and gas sector and enhance synergy between BRI and Saudi Vision 2030 . This could lead to creation of a manufacturing hub in King Salman Energy Park , ET has learnt.It has been further learnt that China is emerging as a key provider of technical support for Saudi Vision 2030. China Communication Service Corporation (CCS) Limited is supplying fibre optic services in supplying fibre optic services to a Saudi Electric Company and Saudi Telecom firms, sources hinted. CCS is also reportedly providing services to Saudi GSM providers. Besides Saudi Space Commission has established partnership with Huawei, it has been learnt. China Railway is involved in Medina Tunnel project.Meanwhile China Harbour Engineering Company has won bid to construct 12 bridges for Saudi Red Sea Tourism Development Company. China is also in talks to sell Unmanned Aerial System to Saudi Arabia. The system can carry mortar shells, aerial bombs and missiles.But Saudi Arabia is not only country in the region where China is paying attention. China Vanguard Industry Corporation visited Kuwait last month to meet Kuwait Air Force officers to push sale of High Altitude Long Endurance ( HAL ) UAV system, ET has learnt. China is also engaging civil society in Kuwait.In UAE Abu Dhabi Department of Economic Development (ADDED) and Department of Industry & IT in China’s Shandong province of China has signed MoU to enhance cooperation and exchange expertise and data on industrial sector. In Oman in recent months China has sought to enhance media partnerships. The two countries have also discussed power sector cooperation.In gas rich Qatar SINOPEC and China National Petroleum Corporation are reportedly planning to invest 29 bn USD in North Field East Project in Qatar as part of China’s strategy to seek long-term LNG contracts with Doha, ET has learnt.In North Africa, Chinese presence is also growing in Morocco and Egypt. Three Confucius institutes are running in Morocco and China plans to extend technical assistance to the local government to build second line of high-speed rail between Casablanca and Agadir. China has also offered expertise in drought management and food security to Moroccan authorities, ET has learnt. In Egypt Chinese firm Harbin Electric International is pushing to build phase 1 & 2 of coal fired power plant at Ayoun Moussa near the Gulf of Suez.Interestingly in Israel, ‘Israel China Policy Centre’ was inaugurated last month at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv. Israeli Minister for Intelligence Elazar Stern was reportedly present at the inauguration along with Chinese Ambassador to Israel Cai Run, it has been learnt.Meanwhile, Turkey and China has pushed economic cooperation through various expositions over the last few months. In war torn Iraq Chinese presence is increasing across power and health sectors and Iraqi PM has denied allegations of stalling Chinese projects. Chinese envoy to Iraq Cui Wei has assured to support Iraq’s sovereignty.ET has reliably learnt that an Iraq-China Agreement Projects Account has been established under which revenues from the export of approximately one lakh barrels of Iraqi Oil per day to China are deposited. This account is managed by the Central Bank of Iraq and the funds accrued are used for Chinese projects in Iraq, ET has learnt. Chinese firms are planning to enter Iraqi banking system. Jordanian firms is allegedly planning to provide services to the Iraqi banks through Huwaei.",
    "Speakers Call for Vaccine Equity, Climate Justice, Institutional Reform, on Day Three of General Assembly’s Annual Debate": "The deepening of inequalities and lack of fair representation in multilateral financial and economic institutions is impeding the international community's effective response to global challenges, the General Assembly heard today as it continued its annual general debate, with speakers echoing calls for vaccine equity, climate justice and institutional reform.\n\nHassan Sheikh Mohamud, President of Somalia, said the COVID-19 pandemic painfully illustrated how far apart the world was in its ability to respond to crisis, with rich nations able to invest in life-saving vaccines more rapidly for their citizens while developing countries, like his own, waited for whatever was available and they could afford, or what they were gifted by international partners. Noting the annual floods and droughts in his country, he said the people of Somalia have long lived harmoniously with nature and barely contribute to greenhouse gas emissions but are the ones paying with their lives today. He urged joint, quick and effective global action to address the climate crisis.\n\nMokgweetsi Eric Keabetswe Masisi, President of Botswana, said many countries in the Global South, especially in Africa, had not met the World Health Organization’s (WHO) 70 per cent vaccination rate by mid-2022, stressing the urgent need for vaccine equity. In a sign of promise, he said 60 per cent of Botswana’s population was now fully vaccinated. Moreover, his Government has approved the manufacturing of the patent-free COVID-19 vaccine Corbevax and construction of a vaccine manufacturing plant has already commenced. He said the facility would produce cancer treatment and next-generation cell-based immunotherapy, in partnership with health institutions.\n\nEmmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, President of Zimbabwe, voiced concern about inadequate financing that could threaten the effective and just transition to renewable energy among developing countries. Underscoring that the international trade architecture under the World Trade Organization (WTO) remained indifferent to the needs of developing countries, he said an increasingly unsustainable debt burden, the prohibitive cost of borrowing, illicit financial flows, and the exploitation of natural resources from developing States “have all combined to relegate developing countries to the periphery of the global financial system”. He called for a just and more inclusive global financial system responsive to those challenges.\n\nEchoing that sentiment, Mia Amor Mottley, Prime Minister, Minister for National Security and the Public Service, and Minister for Finance, Economic Affairs and Investment of Barbados, asked whether the time has come for a review of the settlement of the Bretton Woods institutions, stressing the need to not only eradicate poverty but also equally to protect global public goods. She also called for reform of the Group of Seven (G7) and Group of 20 (G20) countries, noting their exclusion of the people of Africa. “Fairness will mean something only when it is reflected in the international community,” she stressed.\n\nAddressing calls for climate justice, Jonas Gahr Støre, Prime Minister of Norway, said his country has listened to the concerns of developing countries and has decided to double its climate finance to those countries by 2026. Within that target, Norway aims to at least triple its funding for climate adaptation and resilience. Stressing that the fight against climate change requires new, innovative approaches, he pointed out that the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet brings together private and public resources. As co-chair, Norway will work with partners across the global South to support renewable energy transitions, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase clean power, and create green jobs.\n\nDuring the Assembly’s afternoon session, David W. Panuelo, President of the Federated States of Micronesia, said anthropogenic climate change is the most enduring security threat facing his Pacific island country, urging developed countries in particular to provide adequate, accessible and concessional finance for climate mitigation and adaptation, as well as for loss and damage. Speaking to the leaders of the United States and China, who have a special responsibility, he stressed: “Your capacity to cooperate on climate change is necessary towards ensuring our world is habitable for future generations, and does not suffer from civilizational collapse”.\n\nMicheál Martin, Taoiseach of Ireland, voiced concern over the threat of widespread global hunger and food insecurity and the devastating impacts of climate change. Those who bear no responsibility for the causes of climate change are being most affected. Noting the blatant disregard for international law, he said it is not the international community’s systems or structures, nor its Treaties or Charters, that are fundamentally failing humanity but the lack of political will to implement and uphold them. As an elected member of the Security Council, Ireland has seen first-hand that political will and a commitment to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations can deliver results. Yet he voiced his deep frustration at the Council’s failure to adopt a resolution on climate and security, a text supported by 113 countries and vetoed by the Russian Federation.\n\nJosé Gabriel Carrizo, Vice-President of Panama, said the current development model needs to be transformed and he called for considering the value of biodiversity while seeking healthy and sustainable ecosystems. In acknowledging the harsh criticism from young people over the climate summits against the backdrop of rising emissions, deforestation and water pollution, he asked the international community “how can we gain the trust of new generations while the planet on which we live and on which our descendants will have to live is being decimated before their eyes? How many more lives must be lost? How many more natural disasters unfurl?” Wondering when the ecocide will end, he called out the large emitters of gasses, promoters of deforestation and chemical polluters and called for the establishment of an international body which demands accountability from those who damage the planet.\n\nEchoing many speakers alarm about the conflict in Ukraine, Marcelo Luis Ebrard Casaubón, Secretary for Foreign Affairs of Mexico, said just as the world was recovering from COVID-19, the war in Ukraine created suffering and the loss of human lives, impacting access to food and fuel and disrupting the world economy. With the Council unable to implement measures to halt the armed aggression or launch a diplomatic process for a solution, Mexico has stepped in, presenting the Assembly with a proposal to create a caucus of Heads of State and Government to support the Secretary-General’s efforts to build trust and move the Russian Federation and Ukraine towards a peaceful resolution within the Charter’s framework.\n\nAbdullatif Bin Rashid Alzayani, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bahrain, said that armed conflicts and shared economic challenges, if left unresolved, along with the increased threat of terrorist organizations in various parts of the world, would lead to wider conflict with greater destruction, killing, misery, human deprivation and displacement of innocents. “In order for us to avoid or prevent future conflicts, we must do everything in our power to resolve disputes or disagreements before they turn violent,” he said, emphasizing the role of the Organization in that regard.\n\nAlso speaking today were Heads of State and Government, as well as Vice-Presidents and Ministers of Niger, Gambia, Yemen, Kiribati, Guinea-Bissau, Comoros, Liberia, Burundi, Sudan, Israel, Papua New Guinea, Georgia, Malawi, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Portugal, Armenia, Malta, Kuwait, Spain, Jamaica, Austria and Denmark.\n\nThe representatives of Iran and Morocco also spoke in exercise of the right of reply.\n\nThe General Assembly will reconvene at 9 a.m. on Friday, 23 September, to continue its general debate.\n\nStatements\n\nMOKGWEETSI ERIC KEABETSWE MASISI, President of Botswana , said Member States should look no further for solutions to global challenges than to already existing key multilateral frameworks. Among them are the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals therein, the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as the outcomes of the Organization’s major meetings. Botswana is an upper-middle-income country, he said, adding that it is proud of this status given that when it attained its independence only 56 years ago it was among the poorest in the world. It was fortunate to discover what has turned out to be the largest diamond reserve across the Kimberley Belt. Noting that his country turned its discovery of diamonds into a story of development, he said: “Botswana would not have been able to realize its development had it not held onto its belief in the principles of democracy centred on the rule of law, good governance and the protection and enjoyment of basic human rights by its people.”\n\nHowever, Botswana is facing an uphill battle to attract investors to diversify its economy away from a dependence on diamonds, he said, pointing out that that resource is still the bedrock of its economy. He voiced support for the Secretary-General’s call for a world in which power, wealth and opportunity were shared more broadly and fairly at the international level. His country advocates for the Kimberley Process, he said, highlighting that: “Botswana’s story is unquestionable proof and living testimony that diamonds with good governance are for development.” Diamonds are a serious matter of livelihoods, he added, noting that later today his delegation is hosting a side event on diamonds for development. It aims to further broaden conversations with partners including the United Nations, Governments, civil society and the private sector, to ensure that Botswana would also be part of the United Nations family espoused around shared power, wealth and opportunity as it endeavours to realize the 2030 Agenda.\n\nMany countries in the Global South, especially in Africa, have not met the World Health Organization’s (WHO) 70 per cent vaccination rate by mid-2022, he pointed out, stressing the urgent need for vaccine equity. Vaccine hesitancy must also be addressed by countering misinformation and raising awareness of the science, safety and effectiveness of vaccines. As his country has procured enough vaccines to administer to all eligible groups, 60 per cent of its population is now fully vaccinated. Moreover, his Government has approved the manufacturing of the patent-free COVID-19 vaccine Corbevax. Noting that construction of a vaccine manufacturing plant has already commenced, he said the facility would produce cancer treatment and next-generation cell-based immunotherapy. The initiative is being undertaken in partnership with NantWorks, the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development and the Baylor College of Medicine, he said, noting that the partnership will enhance Botswana’s capacity in human vaccine production, contribute to its goal of building a knowledge-based economy and help in preparation for future pandemics.\n\nHe went on to say that Botswana’s recovery plan includes strengthening its protection system to ensure the inclusion of vulnerable groups and persons living with disabilities. As adequate financing is needed to achieve sustainable development, the effective mobilization of domestic and international financial resources, as well as their prudent use, are imperative. He called on development partners to scale up and fulfil their official development assistance (ODA) commitments. His Government is accelerating digitization in the delivery of services and the country’s people are demonstrating conceptual agility to do things differently. He expressed solidarity with fellow Member States in special situations. He called for the removal of unilateral coercive measures targeting Zimbabwe, voicing concern that such actions were not advancing its people’s livelihoods, nor the cause of the Sustainable Development Goals. Turning to the climate crisis, he said his country remains committed to its target of a 15 per cent carbon emissions reduction by 2030 indicated in its nationally determined contribution.\n\nMOHAMED BAZOUM, President of Niger , stated that due to climate change the African continent is being exposed to worsening food insecurity, displacement of populations, recurring droughts and pressures on water resources. He welcomed that the international community has recognized that the upcoming Conference of the Parties will be a unique opportunity to redress this imbalance. In this regard, he expressed his country’s commitment to the proposal brought forth by African negotiators towards a new goal of allocating $1.3 billion by 2025 to face climate change in the Sahel.\n\nTurning to security issues, he mentioned that the situation in the Sahel has worsened in recent years. Since the fall in 2011 of the Libyan regime, he continued, the State has never been able to exercise authority through a stable Government. The south of Libya has become a platform for transnational organized crime, and “we see a blossoming of trafficking in arms, drugs, fuels and migrants,” he noted. He also stated that Mali has never been able to recover from the violence coming from Libya, and in turn has become a breeding ground for terrorism.\n\nThe Sahel has been deeply affected by climate change, he continued, threatening the practice of industrial farming in the region. Many young shepherds have turned to terrorism. He emphasized that violence has led to the recent fall of democratically elected Governments in Mali and Burkina Faso. His country also faces another terrorist threat around the Lake Chad Basin, where groups belonging to the Boko Haram operate. In that context, he stressed that his country’s experience of organizing transparent elections and handing over power in a democratic fashion has shown that “the best way to ward off the effects of terrorist violence is to strengthen the democratic system, and nothing else.” He went on to thank France, the United States and Germany for their support towards his country’s fight against terrorism. Meanwhile, he stressed that the commitment of the international community to fight terrorism in the Sahel still shows “great gaps”. He emphasized that it is high time that the great Powers in the region, as well as the international community, worked together towards effective actions in fighting drug- and arms-trafficking in the Sahel.\n\nHe went on to emphasize that demography, insecurity and terrorism are closely linked in his country. Highlighting that Niger sees an annual population growth rate of 3.9 per cent, an average fertility rate of seven children per woman, and the first pregnancy for around half of the girls happening before the age of 15, he stressed that his country is committed to improve access to education as well as its quality, which in turn slows down the rate of population growth. Becoming emotional and speaking about terrorist violence will not be enough. “We have to act by investing in the resources that we need in education in order to fight the violence of today and prevent the violence of tomorrow,” he said.\n\nADAMA BARROW , President of Gambia , said that the current cost-of-living crisis around the world requires an immediate global response to alleviate the suffering. He welcomed the establishment of the Global Crisis Response Group, expressing hope in concrete action-oriented recommendations and solutions. Amid current socioeconomic challenges, such as a decrease in its tourism sector, heightened inflation and food and energy insecurity, and only modest economic growth, Gambia is developing its National Development Plan 2022-2026. The new plan will advance the pursuit of national priorities, including the Sustainable Development Goals and the Agenda 2063 of the African Union.\n\nDespite its size and economic status, Gambia is at the forefront of fighting climate change through ambitious national action plans. “As a continent, our collective goal is to have a peaceful Africa where the people enjoy the dividends of peace, stability and prosperity,” he said. Africa must be provided with adequate equipment and the means to fully play its peace enforcement role on behalf of the international community. As a longstanding troop– and police–contributing country, it will continue to support the Secretary-General’s Action for Peacekeeping initiative. He went on to emphasize the importance of addressing the frequency in deadly attacks against peacekeepers by giving those missions realistic mandates.\n\nThe complexity of the challenges in the Sahel requires forward-looking solutions, he continued. Contending parties on the ground in Libya will enable its people to live and coexist in peace. He reaffirmed his country’s strong support for the Moroccan autonomy initiative, which “serves as a realistic compromise in accordance with the United Nations resolutions”. Underscoring that developments in the Horn of Africa continue to be a source of serious concern, he called on the leaders of the region and the international community to explore new options to restore peace in the area. Turning to other regions, he called for ending the longstanding embargo imposed on Cuba by the United States, and also for the revival of the Arab Peace Initiative, emphasizing that the Palestinians deserve a State of their own. Speaking on the “plight of the Rohingya”, he said that it remains a matter of grave concern and called on the Government of Myanmar to comply with the rulings of the International Court of Justice and end all human rights violations against the Rohingya. He reiterated that his country considers Taiwan as part of China and advocated for the adoption of the One China Policy.\n\nHe underscored that the cost-of-living crisis, “biting” inflation and food and energy insecurity continue to devastate economies and frustrate pandemic recovery efforts in Africa and elsewhere. He said that the debt burden has reached crisis levels and called for general debt relief. “We implore Russia and Ukraine to heed the global plea for political dialogue and end the war,” he said. “Africa is simply asking for global peace and friendly relations. Our survival and progress depend on global peace and stability,” he added.\n\nRASHAD MOHAMMED AL-ALIMI, President of the Presidential Leadership Council of Yemen , recalled that his country had entered the ninth year of its conflict and denounced the actions of militias and terrorist groups. He welcomed the support and unity of the international community on the Yemeni issue, as it supported the transfer of power based on the Gulf Cooperation Council Initiative and its implementation mechanism in 2011, and the start of the National Dialogue Conference with the participation of all categories of Yemeni society, including the Houthi. It led to a reference document guaranteeing people’s broad participation, their aspirations for democracy, justice, equality and citizenship, as well as freedom of thought and belief.\n\n“This dream is very short lived,” he lamented, as the Houthi terrorist militias turned against the national consensus that emerged from this comprehensive dialogue. The militia prevented a new constitution, tried to invade the capital city and created obstacles to a national agreement and harmed the work of several of the country’s institutions. This was the beginning of a long-running destructive war, which lead to a loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, hundreds of thousands of refugees and to displacement of more than 4 million people. He also stated that floods and droughts, caused by the climate change, cause death and destruction.\n\nSince 7 April, he continued, “a new era has started” in Yemen with the establishment of the Presidential Leadership Council as the sole legitimate representative body of the Yemeni people. Over the past six months, Yemen worked closely with the Saudi-led coalition, the United Arab Emirates, and regional and international partners to set up a reform programme urgently needed and improve the delivery of basic services, as well as to stem the effects of acute inflation and the global food crisis. The Presidential Council acts today in line with the Charter of the United Nations and in cooperation with the Organization’s agencies and political missions to guarantee the political, social and economic rights of women to bring an end to child exploitation. “We want a lasting peace,” he emphasized. He stated that there were also many commitments undertaken by the United States, the European Union and the United Kingdom to finance many processes in Yemen. Nonetheless, his country continues to experience a real gap in funding and therefore required humanitarian emergency assistance and rapid response from humanitarian organizations.\n\nHe underscored the importance of acting against the Houthi militias and to address the Safer oil tanker situation, which might lead to a particularly serious environmental disaster. Furthermore, he called for greater efforts to bring an end to the situation that is being used by the militias as a tool to exert pressure. “We are calling upon all countries of the world to ensure free navigation in international waters,” he added.\n\nTANETI MAAMAU, President of Kiribati , welcomed the recent establishment of the Organization’s multi-country office for the Northern Pacific region, describing it as a “symbolic notion of bringing the United Nations closer for effective and tailored delivery of United Nations services”. He also thanked the countries that have pledged support for and made contributions towards the two initiatives that his country had proposed in relation to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons: establishing a voluntary trust fund to assist those affected by nuclear testing and creating a scientific advisory body to help provide the science needed to address health and environmental problems arising from nuclear tests. “Humanity should be free now and forever from the tests and use of nuclear weapons,” he added.\n\nHe went on to state that a cloud of uncertainty and fear continued to loom over humanity due to the COVID‑19 pandemic, climate change and the war in Ukraine. On the pandemic, he stressed that solidarity had underscored the sustainability of science and its advances, as shown through the production of vaccines, which have saved millions of lives. However, he continued, that solidarity was still lacking for climate action, which continued to be the “stumbling block” to address the global climate change emergency. The targets agreed upon in the Paris Agreement continued to remain “out of reach”. The war in Ukraine had added to the despair and uncertainty through the unnecessary loss of lives, scarcity of food grains and increases in food and fuel prices, he added.\n\nHe emphasized that these challenges, along with many others that have caused much human suffering in the past seven decades, had been “curated” by people in positions of power and influence. “Broken humanity cannot be fixed by wonderful speeches, meetings, resolutions, nor international instruments, but an interplay of greater compassion and solidarity,” he continued, adding that the escalating geostrategic competitions meant that regionalism and solidarity were at risk of being used to serve specific national interests.\n\nFurthermore, he underscored that his country’s efforts to prepare for its graduation from the least developed country status, as recommended by the Organization, were being “scrutinized”. Though Kiribati had been committed to driving its development agenda and ensuring sustainability, it had continued to be “oppressed by neo-colonial thinking that does not take into account our needs, our priorities and our national context”. He continued to state that a system of “global thinking” remained steeped with legacies of environmental destruction that his country’s peoples had inherited, as in the case of the mining of Banaba Island. He called on the international community to work together to ensure that the solutions and actions to correct such legacies work hand in hand with those for today’s interlocking challenges.\n\nEMMERSON DAMBUDZO MNANGAGWA, President of Zimbabwe , said that, despite all the illegal economic sanctions against his country, it has successfully implemented a COVID‑19 national response strategy. Furthermore, it has made significant strides towards ending poverty and hunger, implementing various policies and programmes to support and empower communal and small-scale farmers, which contributed to household and national food and nutrition security. Noting that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement “should remain the primary platforms for negotiating collective global response to climate change”, he expressed concern about inadequate financing for those initiatives, which leaves the scope for effective and just transition to renewable energy among developing countries under serious threat. He hoped that the upcoming 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference would deliver more concrete action on adaptation, loss and damage, climate specific finance, technology transfer and capacity-building. “Zimbabwe is making concerted and deliberate efforts to integrate climate action into national policies,” he said.\n\nZimbabwe is implementing an ambitious programme to increase its number of dams for irrigation, designed to create greenbelts across the country to reduce dependence on rain-fed agricultural activities and increase its export-led production and productivity, he continued. In addition, the country’s comprehensive Agriculture Transformation Strategy has increased production and productivity across its agriculture sector. That has resulted in his country being self-sufficient in its wheat production as well as allowing it to export its horticulture. The “Zimbabwe is open for business mantra”, he said, “has fostered strong partnership between the Government and the private sector for inclusive and sustainable development”. Massive infrastructure development projects, such as dams, energy plants and roads, have broadened its national economic asset base and enhanced regional connectivity and integration.\n\nAn increasingly unsustainable debt burden, the prohibitive cost of borrowing, illicit financial flows, and the exploitation of natural resources from developing States “have all combined to relegate developing countries to the periphery of the global financial system”, he said. Accordingly, he called for a just and more inclusive global financial system responsive to those challenges. Underscoring that the international trade architecture under the World Trade Organization (WTO) remained indifferent to the needs of developing countries, he highlighted the role the African Continental Free Trade Area played in stimulating the continent’s economic growth and development. He further on called for the liberalization of services and strengthening of competition policies and intellectual property rights, along with the adoption of digital trade.\n\n“More work needs to be done globally to close the gender gap,” he said, underscoring that proportional representation for women in Parliament is enshrined in Zimbabwe’s Constitution. To further strengthen participatory democracy and good governance, the Government introduced a 30 per cent quota for women in local authorities. Zimbabwe is modernizing, industrializing based on local resources and its human capital base, as it also continues to entrench democracy, good governance and the rule of law. Despite this success, the ongoing effects of illegal sanctions continue to hamper the country’s progress, including being able to realize sustainable and inclusive development. Zimbabwe’s engagement and re-engagement policy underpins the principles of mutual understanding and respect, he said, noting his country’s desire to be “a friend to all and an enemy to none”.\n\nÚMARO SISSOCO EMBALÓ, President of Guinea-Bissau , said that in the past two years, political stability in his country has increased, reaffirming its role both on the African continent and in “the concert of nations”. However, he expressed concern over the current state of world affairs, namely the war in Ukraine. That war has not only set back the Sustainable Development Goals, it has also resulted in higher food and energy prices.\n\nGiven his country’s specific context as an island nation particularly affected by climate change, he expressed hope that the upcoming twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties in Egypt will deliver concrete strategies to minimize the negative impacts of climate change.\n\nAs Chair of the Authority of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), he underscored the specific security challenges the subregion faces, which are obstacles to the development and well-being of the people. He cited the threat of insecurity as a result of terrorism, violent extremism and transnational crime. While ECOWAS plays a major role in resolving political and institutional crises, the challenges are becoming too numerous to overcome, he said, while also calling for international assistance to stop the spread of terrorism in West Africa and the Sahel region.\n\nAddressing diseases, he focused on malaria, noting that “96 per cent of malaria deaths occur in Africa” and that the continent “has not achieved the established goal of reducing malaria incidence and mortality by 40 per cent by 2020”. Turning to the pandemic, he reminded States that they must adopt appropriate measures to protect all people from infectious diseases everywhere and called on all involved actors to replenish the Global Fund. Finally, speaking about solidarity, he called on the United States to immediately end its embargo on Cuba. His country remains committed to maintaining peace, stability and security, and is a firm supporter of multilateralism, dialogue and cooperation.\n\nAZALI ASSOUMANI, President of Comoros , acknowledging the already difficult reality of managing the fallout from the pandemic which wrought serious damage upon the economy, he lamented the invasion of Ukraine, which displays the not only the fragility of multilateralism but also how quickly food insecurity and risk of famine can arise if that fragility is disturbed. He condemned the invasion in Ukraine in the strongest terms and lauded the Istanbul agreement to export Ukrainian grain as an example of dialogue as a tool to find solutions to avoid the world from “falling into chaos and misery”. Suggesting that the States continue to use dialogue as a tool, he expressed the need for a Palestinian State with its capital as West Jerusalem side by side “in peace and harmony” with the State of Israel. Comoros recognizes the “Moroccan nature” of the autonomous region of the Sahara and Morocco’s sovereignty over it and believes the conflict has lasted too long, he said, encouraging dialogue with its neighbour, Algeria, to achieve peace in the region. Furthermore, he expressed his country’s position that Taiwan is a province of China and called on all Governments to express sensitivity and restraint on the matter. Lessons from the Sahel region teach us that if tensions are allowed to develop on territories, they become fertile ground for terrorist activities, he said, adding that Al-Shabaab poses a threat not only to his Government but to all of Africa. He reminded the Assembly that as Islam is a religion of peace, he cannot consider these groups that threaten peace to be Muslims despite their claims.\n\nRecalling the important role that diplomacy will play in future conflicts, he brought up his country’s own territorial dispute concerning the island of Mayotte. He maintained the position that, in accordance with international law, the island of Mayotte is Comoran in nature and that its sovereignty was removed during decolonization. Though this is a painful dossier that has been open for 40 years, he is glad that dialogue with France is open.\n\nOn climate change, he issued a warning that it would bring about the disappearance of whole regions while others would face climate phenomena such as floods, droughts, loss of coastline and acidification. Though all regions are affected, great attention must be paid to small island nations such as Comoros who are disproportionately affected. Other dangerous phenomena that threaten peace and order are piracy, illegal fishing, pillaging of marine resources and drug and human trafficking and reminded the Assembly that its strategic position in the Indian Ocean requires security and stability.\n\nFocusing on social cohesion, Comoros held a national political dialogue which united citizens around the common goals of peace, security and lasting economic and social development. His country is committed to human rights, multilateralism and to finding solutions “to the problems of our time”, he concluded.\n\nGEORGE MANNEH WEAH, President of Liberia , stated that the challenges confronting the world today require immediate collective action, with the United Nations at the centre, in search of solutions. In so doing, he continued, the international community must give special consideration to the needs of developing countries, particularly those least developed, in line with the Doha Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries.\n\nNoting that more than 60 per cent of his country’s population consists of young people, he highlighted the launch of a youth rehabilitation and empowerment programme, as well as a $13 million fund for the same purpose. As the country’s “Feminist-in-Chief”, he continued, empowering women and promoting gender equality remain key priorities of his Government. Women must be given equally deserved attention, support and “a place at the leadership and governance tables in our society”. Aside from developing a legal framework for this purpose, he underscored that his country is implementing the Spotlight Initiative, in support of the European Union and the United Nations, to end violence and harmful traditional practices against women and girls. He further noted that Liberia is implementing a $50 million project funded by ECOWAS to enhance the capacity of female entrepreneurs.\n\nTurning to the pandemic, he noted that Liberia is on its way to achieving “herd immunity” by the end of 2022, with 67 per cent of the population fully vaccinated. On climate change, he reiterated his country’s commitment to achieve its target of reducing its carbon emissions by 64 per cent by the year 2030. He expressed anticipation that the upcoming Conference of the Parties will provide the opportunity to accelerate actions towards the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change and the Framework Convention on Climate Change.\n\nStressing that sustainable development can only take place in a peaceful and secure environment, he recalled Liberia’s status as a troop-contributing country, with its troops serving in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) and the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA). He then noted that the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) latest appraisal of the ongoing programme in his country is “very positive”, stressing that there are now better prospects for economic growth despite the negative effects of the pandemic.\n\nOn domestic issues, he noted that, after years of civil upheavals, Liberia is becoming a “stronghold of peace and a safe haven for democracy”. Spotlighting that his country eradicated legislation that tended to suppress free speech, he further emphasized that “there is no political prisoner in Liberia”. He added that his nation has constantly and consistently pleaded for a strict adherence to constitutional term limits and for a return to democratic civilian rule in cases of military takeovers. The forthcoming elections in 2023 will be crucial to consolidating his country’s democracy, he continued. “We must let the people decide, and then we must respect their decision,” he stressed.\n\nHASSAN SHEIKH MOHAMUD, President of Somalia , said the pandemic showed how unprepared the world was for such shocks and disruptions. In addition, it painfully illustrated how far apart the world was in its ability to respond to such a crisis through the top-down distribution of vaccines, with rich nations able to invest in life-saving vaccines more rapidly for their citizens while the developing countries, like his own, waited for whatever was available and they could afford, or what they were gifted by international partners. He thanked all dedicated medical professionals on the front lines, and the trilateral and multilateral partners who supported his country’s efforts to vaccinate its people and provide protection for their livelihoods. “Today we must ensure that the global inequality of the COVID‑19 vaccine is not replicated in the looming food security crisis,” he underscored. “We, as a community of nations, must be more optimistic and closely work together rather than retreat to nationalistic isolation, which does not and cannot serve our global citizenry in this new age of interconnectivity and interdependence,” he pointed out.\n\nSomalia was working tirelessly to transition from more than two decades of devastating conflict, droughts, famine and developmental stagnation to a new age of stability, progress and prosperity, he said. However, despite its continuing efforts, his country and its people were facing some of the most complex crises in the world. This included ongoing regional droughts, which directly threatened lives in Somalia’s most vulnerable communities. His Government has called on all of its business community, diaspora and international partners to work with Somalia to do everything possible to avert a potential looming famine and provide immediate support and relief to its most affected communities. Moreover, the international community must meet its commitment to invest in and adequately finance climate adaptation in the most affected and vulnerable regions of the world, including sub-Saharan Africa, he said. Key areas of investment must be sustainable water management, biodiversity protection, climate-smart agriculture, resilient infrastructure and renewable energy, he added.\n\nHe went on to highlight that, for the first time, Somalia has established a new Ministry of Environment and Climate Change to lead the urgent process of addressing the devastating impact of its national and regional environmental deterioration. Somalia is caught between floods and droughts on an annual basis, because of climate change and poor infrastructure. “Our people, who have a long tradition of living harmoniously with nature and who barely contribute to poisonous emissions warming the Earth, are the ones paying with their lives today,” he stressed. “We are therefore taking the matter of protecting our environment seriously because we know that climate change is real, and we are living with the evidence of its destructive and painful reality today,” he said. The global climate crisis must be addressed jointly, quickly and effectively, because “our whole way of life depends on the climate”.\n\nTurning to the issue of terrorism, he said international terrorists or terrorism can neither be contained nor degraded; they need to be comprehensively defeated. Somalia was actively fighting terrorist groups in the country, he said, noting that such groups criminally misrepresent the beautiful and peaceful Islamic religion and values. The unprovoked violence and senseless actions of Al-Shabaab against innocent civilians across Somalia in recent weeks had highlighted the urgent need for an expedited and united response to defeating them permanently. At the height of the humanitarian crisis, that group, which falsely claims to be Islamic, blew up desperately needed water wells and water catchments, banned transport carrying food and killed innocent people who were already struggling to leave due to the severe impact of drought in the country. His Government, with the support of the people, was defeating terrorist groups in major localities where they remained, he pointed out, noting that as recently as August, more towns and villages were recovered. At the policy level, his Government would continue to work with all its partners, including the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS), in the fight against global terrorism.\n\nEVARISTE NDAYISHIMIYE, President of Burundi , said that his country was well on its way to socioeconomic development. He requested the involvement of the United Nations to track down terrorist groups that are beginning to infiltrate the subregion. He stated that his country is working closely with the Democratic Republic of Congo and the United Republic of Tanzania to achieve an ambitious Uvinza-Musongati-Gitega-Bujumbura-Uvira-Kindu railway project to link the three countries.\n\nTurning to education, he said that in Burundi it is free of charge, which has significantly increased school attendance and reduced dropout rates. To transform young people into agents of peace and inclusive development, Burundi created an ambitious Economic Empowerment and Employment Programme. To support this programme, the Government created a young persons investment bank and a support and guarantee fund to facilitate their access to credit. He underscored that an investment bank for women was created as the Government continues to improve health and education for females. The Office of the First Lady of Burundi opened a hospital to treat obstetric fistula. Together with development partners, the office continues to innovate to improve the standard of living of Burundian women.\n\n“Enhancement of economic development of the country particularly includes the development of the agricultural sector”, he stated. To this end, the Government christened 2022 as the “year of agriculture in Burundi”. The development programme includes changing peoples’ mindsets and current practices by encouraging them to reach higher and not simply be content with just producing, developing and consuming locally, but also focusing on exports. In the framework of the environment, Burundi is learning to be resilient towards climate change, not only through practicing sustainable irrigation, but also through activities to protect soil, marking out contour lines, and reforesting land as part of Government-initiated projects.\n\nHe went on to say that his country is progressively developing infrastructure and supports production. The Government has undertaken a vast project to develop the energy sector and seeks to develop a technical and financial partnership in the field of exploration, exploitation and processing of mining and geological products. Lastly, after mentioning the strengthening of national anti-corruption mechanisms, he said that the coastline of Lake Tanganyika is being developed for tourism.\n\nABDEL-FATTAH AL-BURHAN ABDELRAHMAN AL-BURHAN, President of the Transitional Sovereign Council of Sudan , shared his country’s political developments, including its commitment to a peaceful transition, establishment of a real democracy, and free and transparent elections. The end of that transition period will culminate in a civilian regime representing all Sudanese people. In addition, it was decided in a recent communiqué that the military institution would withdraw from that dialogue and that the revolutionary political forces would be allowed to form a civilian Government that would implement the rest of the requests from the transition period. Reiterating his commitment to cooperate with the United Nations Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in Sudan (UNITAMS) and its mandate set forth by the Security Council, he affirmed that cooperation would continue with UNISFA.\n\nHe welcomed public dialogue during the transition period, particularly with youth, community leaders and signatories of the Juba Peace Agreement, noting that such talks would foster national unity. However, though progress had been made, thanks to the tripartite mechanism led by UNITAMS, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and the African Union, the mechanism did not conclude, he said, noting that this made debates on national consensus complicated. Following the December revolution, the Juba Peace Agreement was signed, calming conflict in Darfur and increasing stability in the region. He called upon Abdul Wahid Al Nur and Abdel Aziz al-Hilu to join the “caravan of peace”. He also highlighted community reconciliation and the increased rate of voluntary return of civilians to Darfur.\n\nSudan continues to rise to challenges in the region, he continued. Some achievements included a peace agreement with South Sudan; cooperation with the Government of Somalia; the coordination of a peace agreement in the Central African Republic; and participation in meetings to promote peace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to name a few. Noting progress on efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, the Government adopted a strategic document to reduce poverty between 2021 and 2023. However, he pointed out that Sudan’s progress is limited by external debt. He urged the international community to honour the commitments made in Paris in 2020 and Berlin in 2021, especially in the context of soaring food and energy prices. He also asked for help through the transferring of agricultural technology, capacity-building and the support to build a centre of agricultural research. Though a country of limited resources, Sudan now hosts 4 million refugees from across the continent and he called on the world to remember its duty to provide humanitarian assistance.\n\nSpotlighting other projects on the horizon, he said that Sudan will prioritize disarmament with a focus on combatting the proliferation of small arms and light weapons. Like all developing countries, Sudan is suffering from this scourge which has only been made more complicated through competition over water, pastoral and mineral resources. He also underscored that he supported the African position on Security Council reform. It is through this reform that Sudan, like other States, wishes to address negative practices such as “unilateral wording and the hegemony of penholders”, he said.\n\nYAIR LAPID, Prime Minister of Israel , recalling the “historic” Negev Summit which in March brought together representatives from the United States, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and his country, underscored that his nation has been able to prosper because it chose the future over the past, peace over war, and partnership over seclusion and isolation. He further noted that his country is a vibrant democracy, where Jews, Muslims and Christians live together in “full civic equality”.\n\nHe went on to stress that there are two major threats hanging over the head of his country, as well as of the world. The first is the nuclear threat, he continued, with the fear that “terrorist States and terrorist organizations will get their hands on the nuclear weapons”. The second threat is the demise of truth, where reckless politicians, totalitarian States and radical organizations are undermining the perception of reality. Raising an example of “fake news” about Israel, he asked the international community: “Why are you listening to people who have invested billions of dollars in distorting the truth?” He underscored that his country will not be silent against efforts to spread lies about it.\n\nPointing to Iran, he stressed that “there is only one Member State in the United Nations that openly states its wish to destroy another.” Noting that not only has the country “founded the largest terrorist organization, Hizbullah” while funding Hamas and the Islamic Jihad, he further noted that Iran is making efforts to obtain a nuclear weapon. He called on the international community to make clear to Tehran that the world will not respond with words but with military force if it does. “We will do whatever it takes. Iran will not get a nuclear weapon,” he added.\n\nTo resolve the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict, he stressed that an agreement with the Palestinians based on the two-State solution is the “right thing” for his country’s security, economy and its children, adding that many Israelis support this solution. “War is a surrender to all that is bad. Peace is the victory of all that is good,” he pointed out. He further noted that there is one condition for this solution, which is that the “future Palestinian State” needs to be a peaceful one and not become another terror base that threatens the well-being and the very existence of Israel.\n\nParticularly in Gaza, he emphasized that his country did everything the world had asked it to do, such as dismantling its settlements and military bases, when it left the area 17 years ago. However, he continued, in less than a year Hamas came to power, replacing such facilities with terrorist training camps and rocket launch sites. “Since we left Gaza, over 20,000 rockets and missiles have been fired at Israel,” he highlighted. He stated that his country is ready to lift the restrictions placed on Gaza, on the condition that the firing of rockets and missiles are stopped. “The burden of proof is not on us,” he continued, adding that his country keeps its word and fulfils its promises, proven by peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan, the Abraham Accords and the Negev Summit.\n\nJAMES MARAPE, Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea , urged the Assembly to act decisively for the collective good as “the alternative is to condemn ourselves to a future of doom and gloom”. Welcoming Our Common Agenda and the Transforming Education Summit, he stressed that for his country, education was “a key priority and is guided by our policy of leave no child behind, supported by our Education Sector Development Plan 2023-2027”. Further, citing the “Summit of the Future”, scheduled for September 2024, he said that finding solutions to the multiple crises the international community is facing should “be not defined by the lowest common denominator but rather be more ambitious, yet realistic and workable”. He reaffirmed his country’s commitment to engage in this process, and touched on a set of policies and legislative measures set in place by his Government which are geared towards making Papua New Guinea a middle-income country by 2050.\n\nReporting on his Government’s priorities for the next five years, ranging from industrializing the country’s economy to protecting its immense natural resources and biological diversity, he called on foreign investors to join the country in partnership in various sectors of renewable resources development. Stressing that the existing global economic and financial architecture is “weighed against developing countries” such as his, he urged for structural change. To this end, he supported fellow small island developing States’ calls for their development financing needs to be considered, by taking into account their dimensions of vulnerability rather than their gross national income and urged the international community to support the proposed SIDS Multi Vulnerability Index.\n\nTouching on his Government’s initiatives in agriculture to foster revenue, empower communities and answer to global markets’ needs, he encouraged international partnerships in the field. Ahead of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference, he underscored how climate change affects “coastal communities, including displacement and loss of identity as a people… in his own country and across the Pacific region and beyond, as the carbon emission level continues its destructive spiral out of control”. Reporting on his country’s efforts at implementing its Paris Agreement commitments, he called for an urgent global focus on conservation, preservation and sustainability of the world’s forests, especially with the support of those who produce the greatest carbon footprints. “It is Papua New Guinea’s humble view that the atmospheric balance of oxygen and carbon should be ranked the number one focus of all mankind,” he said. He supported Vanuatu’s initiative to seek an International Court of Justice Advisory Opinion on this existential threat.\n\nRecognizing the importance of empowering and involving youth in decision-making, he welcomed partnerships in the sector and stressed that the country is a main sponsor and strong supporter of the Youth Office in the Secretariat. Combating gender-based violence is “a top priority for my Government”, he added, referring to the work done. Calling for global peace and stability, he urged upholding the Charter. On the Bougainville peace process, he said that “peace by peaceful means underpins this national priority”. He thanked the United Nations for its role in the Papua New Guinea-Melanesian conflict resolution. Finally, he “welcomed and supported the Emergency Special Session measures, invoked under the General Assembly with respect to the situation in Ukraine and to ensure the Security Council is accountable for their actions”.\n\nIRAKLI GARIBASHVILI, Prime Minister of Georgia , recalled that in 2008 his country was attacked by the Russian Federation, which currently occupies 20 per cent of its territory. “The world’s democracies must act as one to ensure that freedom and peace prevail,” he said. Since the Government came to power in 2012, it implemented an ambitious reform agenda on closer collaboration with the United States, the European Union, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the United Nations. As Georgia continues its unequivocal path towards European and Euro-Atlantic integration, its aspirations are “backed by actions and real results”, he said referring to the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area agreement with the European Union and visa-free travel within the Union. “The prospect of acceding to the European Union is a strong motivation,” he added.\n\nHe underscored that his country developed a long-term development strategy, Vision 2030, along with a new national Strategy for Human Rights for 2022-2030. The latter aims to further improve human rights protection standards and is in line with the Sustainable Development Goals. “We are working with the world's leading firms and brightest minds to transform Georgia into a true multidimensional regional hub,” he said. The country’s financial services sector is globally recognized and attracts attention of international investors, its start-up ecosystem is thriving, and its logistics and energy potential is being realized. “We are creating opportunities and giving all the necessary tools to our citizens, including those living in Georgia’s occupied territories,” he confirmed.\n\nHe went on referring to the ongoing full-scale war of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, reiterating that “Georgia stands with Ukraine”. Since the beginning of the war, the Government provided substantial humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and allocated more than 1,000 tons of humanitarian aid. Georgia provides financial assistance and accommodation to over 32,000 Ukrainians currently residing in the country, whereas more than 1,500 Ukrainian students are enrolled in its educational system.\n\nConforming to the report of the United States State Department on the investment climate in Georgia, the National Bank of Georgia and Georgian financial institutions act fully in accordance with the financial sanctions imposed by the United States and others on the Russian Federation. Georgia also aligned with restrictive measures of the European Union against Crimea and Sevastopol, “and for this year, with restrictive measures on Donetsk and Luhansk,” he added. As the conflict in Ukraine has shown, the wider security of the Black Sea is at the forefront of the Euro-Atlantic security agenda, and Georgia, as an indivisible part of the regional architecture, is ready to increase its contribution to common security. Predictability is a crucial precondition for sustainable economic development. “The more predictable the Black Sea region becomes, the more we can unlock its economic potential for the benefit of our people and the global economy”, he said. For that reason, Georgia is developing strategic transport corridors connecting Asia with Europe and participates in several international initiatives to facilitate reliable and efficient commerce across the Black Sea.\n\nJONAS GAHR STØRE, Prime Minister of Norway , stressed that the Russian Federation bears responsibility for the war in Ukraine and is responsible for bringing it to an end. Citing an under-pressure energy supply, soaring inflation and dramatically increased food insecurity as repercussions of the war, he emphasized that ordinary people across the globe are paying the price. The war is amplifying other crises and compounding the impacts of climate change and armed conflict in other parts of the world: The Horn of Africa is faced with its worst drought in more than four decades. Pakistan is contending with devastating floods. More than 300 million people affected by conflicts and humanitarian crises need humanitarian assistance and protection. No continent is more vulnerable to the combined effects of climate change, conflicts and growing food insecurity than Africa. In solidarity with the people grappling with those interlocking crises, his country has allocated more funding to humanitarian assistance and development cooperation in 2022 than ever before.\n\nHe went on to say that, together with a strong alliance of partners, his country is standing with Ukraine and aids its self-defence. “As Europe’s largest supplier of energy, we do what we can to enhance Europe’s resilience,” he added. Norway is standing up for human rights and fundamental freedoms elsewhere, and will continue to promote civic space, protect human rights defenders and support media diversity and independent journalism worldwide. Women’s and girls’ participation in society and their right to decide over their own bodies are essential for democratic and sustainable development. As such, safeguarding these human rights remains among his country’s top priorities. “While supporting Ukraine, we must not forget conflicts elsewhere,” he urged, noting that his country is continuing its peace diplomacy and peacebuilding efforts in major conflicts across the globe. As part of its longstanding engagement in the Middle East, Norway is pushing for an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. As a guarantor country, Norway remains committed to Colombia’s quest for peace, and to supporting the parties in that endeavour.\n\nIn all the peace processes Norway is engaged in, it promotes active involvement and participation by women in line with the women, peace and security agenda, he continued. He said: “We talk to all parties as we work to achieve peaceful conflict resolution. Without dialogue, we have no opportunity to influence the parties and encourage them to move in a more positive direction.” His country also strongly supports the good offices of the Secretary-General in conflicts worldwide, he said, commending him and his team for their important work on the Black Sea Grain Initiative, and Türkiye for its important contribution. “If the global community does not act swiftly, the current food price crisis will develop into a food availability and food supply crisis,” he warned. Together with fighting climate change, his country has placed food security at the top of its development agenda. In 2022, it is allocating more than $300 million in funding for food security initiatives alone. The international community must increase humanitarian assistance and enhance social safety nets; promote local food production in the global South; secure access to seeds, fertilizers and technology for small-scale farmers; and accelerate the transformation to climate-resilient and sustainable food systems. In all of this, the international community must ensure that the needs of women and girls are adequately integrated.\n\nTurning to climate change, he said Norway will honour its commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions and to play a key role in the green transition. It has listened to the concerns of developing countries and has decided to double its climate finance to those countries by 2026. Within that target, Norway aims to at least triple its funding for climate adaptation and resilience. Stressing that the fight against climate change requires new, innovative approaches, he pointed out that the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet brings together private and public resources. As co-chair, Norway will work with partners across the global South to support renewable energy transitions, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase clean power and create green jobs. He pointed out that the oceans can be a vital part of the solution to climate change, food insecurity and poverty. If adequately managed and protected, the oceans hold the key to reaching many of the Sustainable Development Goals. The High-level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy, co-chaired by Norway, is an initiative by world leaders committed to ocean health and ocean wealth, in support of the 2030 Agenda. The Panel members have committed to sustainably manage 100 per cent of the ocean areas under their national jurisdiction.\n\nMIA AMOR MOTTLEY, Prime Minister, Minister for National Security and the Public Service, and Minister for Finance, Economic Affairs and Investment of Barbados , underscored that: “A Security Council that retains the power of veto in the hands of a few will still lead us to war.” Therefore, the reform of the Council must not simply be in its composition but also be in the removal of that veto. Moreover, the recognition of the Group of Seven (G7) and Group of 20 (G20) countries as the informal subcommittee of governance in the world, if it is to be fair, must include the people of Africa and African descent. “How can a world have at its core a subcommittee that excludes more than 1.4-1.5 billion people of the world and expect it to reflect fairness and transparency in its decision-making,” she asked. Fairness will mean something only when it is reflected in the international community.\n\nShe went on to say that the international community must fight for reform so that citizens are not made victims of poverty as a result of the triple crisis of climate, pandemic and of the conflict that is leading to inflationary pressures. Voicing concern for the people of Haiti and the situation in the country, she stressed that any attempt to increase fuel prices in any part of the world by 150 per cent would have been met with great consternation by populations with fixed income. Similarly, she urged the same transparency to occur with respect to removal of the 60-year blockade against Cuba. Addressing the people of the United States, she said: “…there is nothing that justifies further hardship to people because of ideological differences.”\n\nNoting that some are even benefiting from crisis disproportionately and egregiously, she asked whether the time has come for a review of the settlement of the Bretton Woods institutions that no longer serve the purpose in the twenty-first century that they served in twentieth century. “The century in which we live not only demands the eradication of poverty but also equally the protection of global public goods,” she said.\n\n“If companies, multinational companies have contributed to the global public risk or benefit from the solutions from global public goods then they ought to contribute, through a small portion of their profits, funding the needs of countries whether on issue of climate resilience adaptation, biodiversity protection, public health, she added, noting other areas. She commended IMF for its rapid financing mechanism at the beginning of the pandemic and for the to be launched Resilience and Sustainability Trust — the first recognition that middle-income countries should be able to access funding irrespective of per capita income and dependent on climate vulnerability.\n\nLAZARUS MCCARTHY CHAKWERA, President of Malawi , said climate change is a global problem that would never be solved unless all nations solve it together. “Yet months after Malawi and its Sustainable Development Goals gains were set backwards by two tropical storms in quick succession, we have been left behind,” he asserted, spotlighting other global issues that called for global cooperation: pandemics, regional insecurity and food shortage. As a result of collective negligence, the global economy was now a house on fire, and some nations were left in the burning building, he continued, rejecting any attempts to politicize human suffering.\n\nAddressing the current global food crisis, he noted that his country had just joined the Feed the Future initiative, providing access to new financing in the next few years to use Malawi’s vast arable land and large volumes of fresh water to develop mega-farms that will feed the world and lift millions of their farmers out of subsistence living. “Malawi’s economic rise is imminent,” he stressed, citing the recent discovery in his country of the largest deposit of rutile in the world as well as the agricultural revolution that is coming to Malawi.\n\nOn climate change mitigation and adaptation, he said disasters such as floods, drought, pests, and cyclones were reversing years of developmental gains. Cyclones Ana and Gombe alone destroyed strategic infrastructure, community assets, and displaced thousands of households. And now, one fifth of Malawi’s population was at risk of acute food shortage, as 3.6 million Malawians were facing hunger from next month until March. Although Malawi and other least developed countries contribute the least to climate change, they remain committed to the global climate agenda, he said, recalling Malawi’s own ambition to cut carbon emissions by half before the year 2040.\n\nUnderlining the importance of access to COVID-19 vaccines and strengthening health systems to build resilience against future pandemics, he called for investments in health infrastructure and research. To this end, he welcomed the news that six African States have been chosen to produce messenger RNA vaccines in Africa, as well as Malawi’s role as a co-pioneer of the Accord for a Healthier World announced by Pfizer in Davos four months ago, aimed at bringing quality medicines to 1.2 billion people in low-income countries.\n\nHe went on to highlight one problem in desperate need of a solution for the most vulnerable least developed countries: the unsustainable debt levels and distress they bear. In this context, he welcomed the recent call of the IMF Managing Director on the world’s major lenders to relieve vulnerable countries of the debts that are shackling them, as even loans that were given and received in good faith have become unsustainable in the current climate of unforeseen external shocks. He commended China for fulfilling the pledge to forgive interest-free loans owed by 17 African countries. “Let this be the beginning of breaking the chains holding vulnerable countries back,” he asserted. United States President Joseph Biden’s recent call to defend the rights of smaller nations as equals of larger ones “must not only be applauded, it must be uploaded,” he added, calling for a reformed United Nations that uses its multilateral muscle to give equal attention to public health, food insecurity, climate change and conflict, regardless of where they emerge or whom they affect. “We are one humanity facing the same storm in the same boat,” he concluded.\n\nDAVID W. PANUELO, President of the Federated States of Micronesia , said that his country’s foreign policy is to be a “friend to all and an enemy to none.” Expressing support for Ukraine, he strongly encouraged Member States, particularly those with greater influence and means, to firmly stand with that country’s people and Government and show that aggressive, violent behaviour won’t be tolerated, as “an infringement on the rights of one is an infringement on the rights of us all”. Amid traditional security concerns, anthropogenic climate change is the most enduring security threat facing his Pacific island country, he underscored, urging the international community, especially developed countries, to commit to the Paris Agreement goals by providing adequate, accessible and concessional finance for climate mitigation and adaptation, as well as for loss and damage. To that end, he called for the adoption of an agenda item for the Twenty-seventh Session of the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change on a Loss and Damage Response Fund, the establishment of that Fund in the Conference, and its full operationalization to be completed in the twenty-eighth Conference.\n\nCurrent efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are wholly inadequate, as many actors continue to engage in the worst emitting activities, he said. Noting that carbon dioxide reduction alone will not cool the planet in the near-term, he urged all countries to commit to the Kigali Amendment and the Global Methane Pledge of a 30 per cent reduction in methane emissions from 2020 levels by 2030. He called on the United States and China to resume cooperation on tackling climate change, stressing: “Your capacity to cooperate on climate change is necessary towards ensuring our world is habitable for future generations, and does not suffer from civilizational collapse”.\n\nThe Organization’s Pacific Multi-Country Office (MCO) in the Federated States of Micronesia has added value to his country’s COVID-19 response and access of available funding sources and technical support through the United Nations system, he said. “Small Island Developing States such as Micronesia are in dire need of support from our partners to support our country-driven development strategy,” he said, noting that distance remains challenge in providing service delivery and commending United Nations agencies for reaching every island in the country and in the subregion, including vulnerable outlying islands.\n\nDespite the successful conclusion of the ocean conferences in Palau and Lisbon, critical works remains to fully protect ocean resources, which are a common heritage of mankind, he said, stressing that his country looks forward to the resumption and conclusion of the Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction Treaty negotiations very soon. A member of the Alliance of Countries for a Deep-Sea Mining Moratorium, the Federated States of Micronesia believes that deep seabed mining in the International Seabed Area should not occur until the precautionary principle, ecosystem approach and the “polluter pays” principle have been implemented, or until a set of exploitation regulations by the International Seabed Authority are finalized. With some of the largest fishing grounds in the Pacific, spanning 1.1 million square miles, and one of the most productive tuna fisheries in the Western and Central Pacific, he said his country’s maritime zones are exposed to threats of transnational crimes and illegal activities. He therefore called on partners to support the country’s efforts to build law enforcement capacity in maritime surveillance to address money laundering and terrorist financing, drug trafficking and other transnational crimes. To this end, he thanked Australia, Japan and the United States for the support provided, and invited other States to offer more aid.\n\nHe expressed the country’s “gravest concern” about Japan’s decision to discharge, starting next year, nuclear-contaminated water, otherwise known as Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS) water, into the ocean. “We cannot close our eyes to the unimaginable threats of nuclear contamination, marine pollution, and eventual destruction of the Blue Pacific continent,” he underscored. Touching on key structural reforms undertaken by the leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum, he called on all countries who engage with the Pacific to support and respect the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent.\n\nHUSSEIN ABDELBAGI AKOL AGANY, Vice-President of South Sudan , speaking on behalf of South Sudan President Salva Kiir Mayardit, said the Revitalized Peace Agreement signed on 12 September 2018 between the Government and opposition groups ended the internal conflict in South Sudan. The parties are committed to implement the peace accord, which has improved the country’s security. The Government is working to resettle internally displaced persons and refugees are now returning to their homes. The command structure of the National Unified Forces has been established, which is a major leap towards transformation and regularization of the forces. Since the unification of the command structure in April 2022, there has been a de-escalation in clashes between the South Sudan Peoples’ Defence Forces and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-in-Opposition. In addition, the first batch of 53,000 National Unified Forces successfully graduated on 30 August 2022 and parties to the peace accord have agreed on a roadmap to complete the agreement’s remaining tasks. This will pave the way for free, fair, and credible election at the end of the transitional period.\n\nWith targeted actions, South Sudan has contained the spread of COVID-19 and as of 9 May 2022, it had only 17,513 confirmed cases, including 138 deaths since the pandemic’s start, he said. The current vaccination campaign is effective, with 45 per cent of the entire population over the age of 18 vaccinated. South Sudan ratified the Paris Agreement on climate change in April 2016 and is coping by building nature-based solutions, green infrastructure and fostering socioeconomic recovery. The impacts of climate change and global warming are real in South Sudan. For example, more than 70 per cent to 80 per cent of the country has been impacted by floods over the last three years. Food insecurity is another issue and between February to March 2022, about 6.83 million people, or 55.3 per cent of the population, were facing acute food insecurity.\n\nSurrounded by countries afflicted by conflict, South Sudan is working to promote peace and stability in the region and has successfully mediated the armed conflict in Sudan, which led to the signing of Juba Peace Agreement in 2020. South Sudan stands ready to mediate the current conflict between the army and the Forces of Freedom and Change in Sudan, so that Sudan can finally enjoy lasting peace, he said.\n\nRecently, South Sudan offered to mediate tensions between Egypt and Ethiopia over their disagreement on the construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, he continued. By promoting regional peace and stability, South Sudan has shown it is a reliable partner in that regard. The current war between the Russian Federation and Ukraine is very unfortunate, devastating to the citizens of both countries and beyond, while leading to severe humanitarian crises. “From the moral point of view, South Sudan Government is calling on Russia and Ukraine to cease all forms of hostilities and resolve the dispute through diplomatic and constructive dialogue to avert further consequences,” he said.\n\nPHILIP ISDOR MPANGO, Vice-President of the United Republic of Tanzania , said human greed, selfish desire and unilateralism were the root causes of conflicts and geopolitical tensions, the pandemic’s devastating effects, food and energy insecurity, extreme climate change, stubborn poverty and barriers to shared prosperity. Referencing the Kiswahili proverb, “Where there are problems, ingenuity increases,” he called upon the international community to uphold a caring spirit to ensure the needs and happiness of other peoples and nations and to adhere to the credo of multilateralism and collaboration.\n\nFocusing on the COVID-19 pandemic, he underscored the need for national and global health systems to be better prepared through investments in building health infrastructure, expanding the health workforce and enhancing national and regional capacity to manufacture drugs, supplies, vaccines and medical equipment. While the late provision of support and financing highlighted the need for African countries to work together on developing indigenous solutions, he acknowledged and thanked development partners for their support on pandemic response and recovery.\n\nExpressing appreciation for the upscaling of mitigation and adaptation efforts under the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement on climate change, the most vulnerable countries, he noted, continued to be disproportionately affected and without the capacity to effectively respond. While the United Republic of Tanzania has committed to ambitious adaptation and mitigation targets, there must be “immediate, rapid and large-scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions”, he said, to limit global warming. He called on the international community to ensure reliable access to climate finance, abide their commitments to the Paris Agreement, enhance capacity-building and technology transfer, support adaptation and mitigation measures and create a financial facility on independent loss and damage. In emphasizing Africa’s need for a just transition to renewable energy, he also called for the opposition to global financing and the implementation of hydrocarbon projects to be lifted as “our Sovereign rights to pursue transformative projects should be respected.” Carbon credit markets must be transparent and must benefit Africa fairly.\n\nOn international peace and security, he pleaded for continued focus on the safeguarding of human lives and well-being, especially those of children and women. Citing the disruptive effects on global supply chains, he reminded all of their responsibility to pursue the peaceful resolution of conflicts by leveraging their abundant resources and human capabilities. As the United Republic of Tanzania is proud of its participation in five of the existing 16 peacekeeping missions, he offered additional contributions if requested. Reaffirming his country’s continued and active participation in regional peace initiatives as a member of the African Union Peace and Security Council, East African Community (EAC) and Southern African Development Community (SADC), he called upon the United Nations to enhance its support to regional peacebuilding and peacekeeping efforts.\n\nAs the credibility of the United Nations rests on a well-represented and responsible Security Council, he reiterated the common African position for the long-awaited reforms. Echoing the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration, he said: “it is well past time the United Nations Security Council reflected the present-day realities of the United Nations membership and not that of the 1940s.” In acknowledging the first global celebration of the Kiswahili language on 7 July while commending the efforts of the United Nations in promoting multilingualism as a core value, he reaffirmed the United Republic of Tanzania’s resolve to uphold peace and security, development and human rights. All Member States, he urged, must renew their commitment and prioritization of actions especially on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n\nJESSICA ALUPO, Vice-President of Uganda , called for strengthening international solidarity and cooperation to address common challenges, such as poverty, health, food insecurity, climate change and biodiversity loss. The need to revitalize the Organization is stronger than ever and multilateralism is crucial for meeting the common challenges faced by all countries. It is also essential to scale up the production of the world’s vaccination capacity to mitigate the effects of COVID-19. She thanked the many partners that have helped Uganda in this matter. Stressing that achievement of the global goals is crucial for the world and the institutional architecture must be strengthened to keep countries on track to achieve them by 2030, she said her Government has mainstreamed the global goals into its national development plan and works with other stakeholders to ensure collaboration with all actors. This requires support in the areas of technology transfer, capacity-building and financing.\n\nClimate change is one the greatest challenges of all time and Africa suffers disproportionately, she said. Uganda is experiencing many problems, including drought, the melting of ice caps and floods. It is regrettable and hypocritical that some of the regions and nations that have mismanaged the environment and are disproportionately responsible for global warming have embarked on a rigorous campaign to thwart the efforts of other countries to responsibly and sustainably develop the oil and gas sectors. Development should be environmentally friendly, inclusive and provide benefits for all. “It should leave no one behind,” she said. Uganda has scaled up its investments in climate adaption, for example, increasing its access to clean energy and expanding the forest and wetland covers. Her country is playing a vital role in helping developing countries to meet challenges and it will keep strengthening North-South, South-South and triangular cooperation with the United Nations.\n\nAs the world faces many challenges, the conflict in Ukraine is causing more destruction, she said, expressing deep concern about loss of life and suffering. She supported a dialogue to reach a peaceful end to the conflict that ensures the safety of all. Turning to terrorism, she said no region of the world has been safe from the scourge of and Uganda supported all global and regional counter-terrorism efforts. Peace, security and development are linked and should be pursued together. The Ugandan Government plays a part in regional groups to build peace, including the African Union and the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region. Stressing the refugee situation is a crucial regional issue, she said Uganda had 1.5 million refugees, the largest refugee population in Africa and the third-largest in the world.\n\nTurning to reform of the Security Council, she said equitable reform was more necessary than ever before and Africa, which has more than 1 billion citizens and is the topic of 70 per cent of Council agenda items, is not represented. This balance needs to be taken care of with comprehensive Council reform, which she hopes can be achieved in the inter-governmental process. The Non-Aligned Movement is a strong pillar to address global challenges and Uganda remains committed to working with other countries in this group. Her Government looked forward to hosting the nineteenth Non-Aligned Movement Summit in Kampala in December 2023, she added.\n\nJOSÉ GABRIEL CARRIZO, Vice-President of Panama , in fully aligning his country with the themes of the seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly, called for the promotion of creative solutions, greater solidarity and science as an ally to address future challenges, saying “it is a selfish act to concentrate rather than to share knowledge.”\n\nElaborating on Panama’s focus on saving lives, avoiding the collapse of the health system and maintaining social order, he highlighted his Government’s work in addressing unacceptable levels of inequality, consolidating democracy and strengthening the independence of the justice system which included Supreme Court appointments based on merit, the majority of whom are women. Panama, he continued, demonstrated creativity and innovation in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic by developing technology tools to directly provide care and implement centralized tracing and monitoring systems. In preventing the disruption to schooling, Panama also guaranteed free Internet access including for remote communities. He then spoke of a platform under development on real-time medicine availability, location and competitive pricing and offered to share Panama’s experiences and advances with the international community. Expressing his steadfast belief that dialogue, civic participation and consensus build social peace, he highlighted Panama’s response to protests and the broad consultations and national agreements on addressing the rising costs of food, medicine and gasoline. For the global context, he stressed, “dialogue is the only way to shrink the space available to extremism.”\n\nOn the manufacture, supply and distribution of medicines, he lamented the mercantile and mercenary situation in which millions of people do not have access adding “such a system which is shameful to humanity cannot continue. It is everyone’s responsibility and its global implications must be examined and addressed.” In calling for access to medicines to be valued as a human right, Panama proposed the adoption of a global initiative to resolve excessively high prices and the lack of access. Turning to migration, he noted the situation includes and conceals criminal organizations engaging in human trafficking. In referencing Panama’s state policy on helping migrants out of solidarity and humanity, he stressed the involvement of recipient and host countries. Countries of origin must also be involved by addressing the poverty and social marginalisation fuelling irregular migration.\n\nExpressing his country’s belief that the current development model needs to be transformed, he called for considering biodiversity’s value and seeking healthy and sustainable ecosystems. In acknowledging the harsh criticism from young people over the climate summits, fora and declarations which have occurred against the backdrop of rising emissions, deforestation and water pollution, he asked the international community “how can we gain the trust of new generations while the planet on which we live and on which our descendants will have to live is being decimated before their eyes? How many more lives must be lost? How many more natural disasters unfurl?” Wondering when the ecocide will stop, he called out the large emitters of gasses, promoters of deforestation and chemical polluters. In advocating for the establishment of an international body which demands accountability from those who damage the planet, he reiterated Panama’s continued commitment to building a new world that ensures human health and life on the planet, a world with more solidarity and peace.\n\nANTÓNIO COSTA, Prime Minister of Portugal , in referencing the “unjustified and unprovoked” invasion of Ukraine, said “the gravity of the acts committed makes an independent, impartial and transparent investigation imperative so that the crimes committed do not go unpunished”. Reiterating Portugal’s support for Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of while urging others to condemn the Russian Federation’s aggression, he called upon the latter to cease hostilities and allow for a serious, sustained ceasefire- and peace-oriented dialogue noting that “this is not the time for Russia to escalate the conflict or to make irresponsible threats to resort to nuclear weapons.” In welcoming the efforts of the Secretary-General and the entire United Nations system in resolving the conflict and mitigating its effects, Portugal reiterated its solidarity with all peoples who are suffering, particularly in Africa. Sanctions, he warned, must not directly or indirectly affect the production, transportation and payment of cereals and fertilizers.\n\nThrough calling for a representative, agile and functional Security Council whose actions are scrutinized by other members of the United Nations, he stressed a comprehensive view of security that recognizes climate change as an accelerant of conflict. The Council should have permanent seats for the African continent, Brazil and India and should represent small countries more fairly. In referencing the Secretary-General’s New Agenda for Peace, he emphasized a global vision of security which focuses on conflict prevention and ensures adequate, predictable and sustainable funding for peacebuilding. Turning to Africa, he said the international community had a duty to support stability in African nations and African solutions to African problems. The Sahel requires a concerted and multidimensional effort that ensures humanitarian assistance. States must respond in a targeted, effective manner to the global terrorist threat, especially in Mozambique, the Sahel and the Gulf of Guinea and must address the root causes of radicalization. Recalling Portugal’s current presence in four peacekeeping operations, particularly in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA), he expressed pride over international recognition of his country’s contributions to crisis and conflict management on all continents.\n\nElaborating on the undeniable link between climate and security, he expressed hope that the upcoming twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties would lead to an inclusive transition and ensures a balanced allocation of climate finance on mitigation and adaptation. Pledging to accelerate Portugal’s commitments to decarbonization, he promised continued strong investment in renewable gases and in solar, wind and ocean energy. He welcomed the active participation of all States in the second Oceans Conference which was co-organized with Kenya and reiterated Portugal’s commitment for 100 per cent of Portugal’s maritime space to be in good environmental status by 2030. Advocating for a post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework which enshrines the 30 by 30 goal, he urged progress on the treaty on Marine Biodiversity in Areas Beyond Natural Jurisdiction by the end of the year.\n\nAs the transition to a prosperous, green and digital future must not leave anyone behind, social policies “must be at the heart of our action, of the development of our economies, of the fight against climate change”, he said. He supported the Secretary-General’s proposed Social Summit and called for the adoption of a global pandemic treaty. Respect for, protection and promotion of human rights was Portugal’s top priority, he said, pledging continued dedication to the universal abolition of the death penalty. Portugal supports the women, peace and security agenda. It will also continue its constructive participation on migration and its support on the integration of migrants and the promotion of pathways for labour mobility. Reaffirming Portugal’s leading role on the Youth Agenda, he called for the United Nations to have the tools to ensure the participation of young people in decision-making processes. Emphasizing that the Organization must become more efficient, fairer and more representative, he said Portugal “will not miss this call” and stands ready as a candidate for the Security Council seat for 2027-2028.\n\nNIKOL PASHINYAN, Prime Minister of Armenia , said that on 13 September Azerbaijan launched an unprovoked military aggression against Armenia: its armed forces shelled 36 residential areas and communities, including the towns of Goris, Jermuk, Vardenis, Kapan, and Geghamasar. This was not a border clash, it was a direct attack against the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Armenia, he underscored.\n\nDetailing the Azerbaijani attack that deliberately targeted the civilian population and vital civilian infrastructures, he said all the residents of Jermuk are displaced while overall number of people temporarily displaced from Gegharkunik, Vayots Dzor, and Syunik regions is more than 7,600, mostly women and elderly, among them 1,437 children and 99 persons with disabilities. He said 192 houses, three hotels, two schools, and one medical facility were destroyed, and seven electrical infrastructure systems, five water infrastructure systems, three gas pipelines and one bridge were damaged. The Kechut water reservoir was targeted and shelled, as were journalists and ambulances. As a result of the aggression, the number of victims and missing persons exceeded 207, he said, citing cases of torture, mutilation of captured or already dead servicemen, extra-judicial killings, and ill-treatment of Armenian prisoners of war. The dead bodies of Armenian female military personnel were mutilated and then video-recorded with cruelty by the Azerbaijani servicemen.\n\nWarning that Azerbaijan intends to occupy more territories of Armenia and the risk of new aggression remains very high, he recalled that Azerbaijan is keeping under occupation tangible territories of Armenia. “Could you show the map of Armenia, that you recognize or are ready to recognize as the Republic of Armenia?” he asked the President of Azerbaijan, a country that “will continue to use delimitation process for territorial claims against Armenia”. On the opening of regional transport communication links, he said Armenia — despite being portrayed by Azerbaijan as a “destructive side in this discussion” — is ready to open its roads for Azerbaijan in the framework of its national legislation.\n\nHe went on to underline that the most recent Azerbaijani aggression is happening while the humanitarian consequences of the 2020 war in Nagorno-Karabakh had not been addressed yet. In this context, he drew attention to the post-war rehabilitation of Nagorno-Karabakh, the psycho-social issues of the displaced population, and the repatriation of Armenian prisoners of war. The Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh need the support of the international community, he stressed, calling for unhindered access of United Nations humanitarian agencies to Nagorno- Karabakh. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the independent fact-finding mission of United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) should have access to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict zone, he asserted. Unfortunately, he continued, Azerbaijan has been blocking both missions. He concluded by reiterating his country’s determination to defend its democracy, independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity by all means.\n\nMICHEÁL MARTIN, Taoiseach of Ireland , voiced concern over the threat of widespread global hunger and food insecurity. Drawing attention to the devastating impacts of climate change, with those who bear no responsibility for its causes being most affected, as well as the most blatant disregard for international law, he said it is not the international community’s systems or structures, nor our Treaties or Charters, that are fundamentally failing humanity. It is the lack of political will to implement and uphold them.\n\nAs an elected member of the Security Council, Ireland has seen first-hand that political will and a commitment to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations can deliver results. On Syria, he reported that Ireland had twice renewed the United Nations cross-border operation, which provides crucial aid to 4 million people in the country’s north-west. Recalling progress on the women, peace and security agenda, Ireland has ensured that the role of women as peacebuilders, and as agents of change, is at the heart of United Nations peacekeeping missions. Reiterating his country’s commitment to the protection of civilians, he called the Political Declaration on the use of Explosive Weapons in Populated Areas “a significant milestone”. However, he voiced his deep frustration at the Council’s failure to adopt a resolution on climate and security, a text supported by 113 countries and vetoed by the Russian Federation. In this context, he expressed concern over the looming humanitarian catastrophe and the violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in Tigray.\n\nHe went on to underscore that Israeli settlement-building undermines the territorial contiguity of a future Palestinian State, and jeopardizes a two-State solution. On Afghanistan, since the Taliban takeover of Kabul, Ireland has resolutely defended the human rights of the Afghan people, particularly women and girls, and has increased its humanitarian aid and pushed for accountability for the Taliban’s actions. The international community witnesses the ongoing erosion of the rights of Afghan citizens, particularly women and girls, but also those of ethnic and religious minorities and the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex and questioning (LGBTQI+) community.\n\nFurthermore, he continued, the heightened nuclear risks arising from the Russian aggression against Ukraine, and the threats to nuclear security resulting from military activity in and near civilian nuclear facilities in that country, were unprecedented. Moscow’s illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine carried dark echoes of Europe’s past, he asserted, voicing concern over an expansionist power brutally invading and occupying a peaceful neighbour. “In Ukraine in July, I heard first-hand accounts from civilians of the brutality and violence visited upon men, women and children by occupying Russian forces,” he recalled, citing wanton destruction, and the uncovering of mass civilian graves, such as in Bucha and more recently in Izium.\n\nHe highlighted that the impact of Moscow’s aggression reaches far beyond Ukrainian or European shores and borders: from the Horn of Africa to the Sahel, and beyond, food insecurity has reached a critical tipping point. Combined with the impact of climate change, and of conflict, severe drought and other extreme weather events, the world faces a crisis that needs urgent action. To that, Ireland has responded by increasing its humanitarian aid. This has included direct humanitarian support of €78 million for the Horn of Africa, and sustained and early funding to other severely affected countries and regions, including Yemen, Afghanistan and the Sahel. And yesterday, Ireland committed an additional €50 million over 3 years specifically to tackle acute child malnutrition. Ending world hunger and ensuring the right to food must be placed firmly at the top of the political agenda, he asserted.\n\nROBERT ABELA, Prime Minister of Malta , said that as an island State in the Mediterranean, his country has witnessed first-hand the effects of conflicts in its southern area. Citing neighbouring Libya, he called for the international community to put aside vested interests in the country — which is what the Libyan people deserve and what’s best not just for the region, but for the Mediterranean continent and the African continent in general. Citing the threat to global food supplies and energy markets, mostly because of the war in Ukraine, he noted those pressures impact small islands like his harder due to their insularity and other specificities. “The right to food is a recognized human right,” he stressed, with number of poor globally estimated to have increased by over 70 million people. In a related vein, his country is a firm believer that international fair trade is a key element for the development of nations and particularly important for smaller economies. Citing the unprovoked aggression on Ukraine, he noted Malta would continue to provide humanitarian assistance to innocent civilians and condemn tactics and recent statements that do not augur well.\n\nFor decades, globalization has been hailed as the next frontier of economic growth — by enabling human, financial and capital resources to find their best possible deployment, and fostering jobs through international trade, he said. However, it is imperative that during these trying times, the international community avoid any temptation to put climate on the bac",
    "Mahathir still has a role to play in this world: Sin Chew Daily contributor": "KUALA LUMPUR (SIN CHEW DAILY/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - Since the \"Sheraton Move\" in February 2020 that had caused the collapse of the Pakatan Harapan (PH) government, not many Malaysians have nice words to say about Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad.\n\nSome even use derogatory language to condemn this former Prime Minister, who had ruled the country twice. This disrespect is a stark contrast to praises showered on him on May 9, 2018, when he led the PH opposition coalition to oust the ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) led by Najib Razak, who was besieged by 1MDB scandal and other corruption-linked issues then.\n\nAfter winning the May 2018 general election, Mahathir was touted by Malaysia's richest man Robert Kuok as \"the man who had saved Malaysia\" when the Hong Kong-based tycoon came a-calling. It was no easy feat to bring down the Umno-led BN coalition, which had ruled the country for 61 years.\n\nBut like many Malaysians, Robert Kuok might regret what he had said after the unexpected \"Sheraton Move\" that sent Malaysia back to square one, bringing an end to a 22-month cleaner but chaotic rule by the PH coalition.\n\nMahathir, who shocked the nation by quitting as premier in February 2020, was seen as approving the political coup staged by his own men to deprive premier-in-waiting Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim the chance to succeed him.\n\nMalaysians are angry that for the past two years, the country was hit by one political upheaval after another, with two changes to the premiership. The current Prime Minister is now pressured by his own party Umno to hold a snap general election. The return of Umno and corrupt practices in government has brought utter disappointment to the people. Young people, including my son, are asking whether Malaysia has a future.\n\nWhile many voters are hoping the old man, who still wants to be premier for the third time, will quit the political scene totally, I hold a different view. I see him as still having a role to play - at least on international stage. Just last month, the 97-year-old made some commendable remarks that few leaders in Asean would be bold enough to voice out when facing Washington.\n\nAmid tense US-China trade war and non-stop US sanctions imposed on China, Mahathir told the Financial Times of London late August that Asean \"should be close to China\" as China is a big market for Malaysia and the region. Asean needed to stay away from the US and the West's \"provocation\" of China as maintaining economic relationship with Beijing was crucial, he added.\n\nWashington and its Western allies have destabilised the region immensely as they constantly send their warships to the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait. This has caused Beijing to react with military drills. Although the US says it subscribes to one-China policy, it regularly sells arms to Taiwan - a province of China - to challenge the sovereignty of China.\n\nMahathir's other nice comments about China - calling it a \"very good trading partner\" and has not invaded any country - is what most leaders feel. In fact, the world needs some fearless souls like Mahathir. His comments are timely and enlightening, even though he is no longer in power.\n\nMahathir, very often with his justified anti-West stance, has indeed placed Malaysia on the world map. His policy to \"buy British last\" in the early 1980s in response to British premier Mrs Margaret Thatcher's move to raise tuition fees for foreign students was shocking and impactful. So were his other comments made against the West. My elder sister who was then working as a nurse in London told me: \"I feel proud to be a Malaysian. We have a prime minister who dares to say no to the powerful West.\"\n\nAsean leaders know that China is very important to the region. China is the largest trading partner of Asean and a key investor in the region. The US is expected play a role in regional security, but it should not destabilise the region just because it wants to contain China. And the US is expected to know it will never be able to replace China in economic terms.\n\nAccording to China Daily, China has remained the largest trading partner of Asean for 13 consecutive years. China-Asean trade hit US$544.9 billion (S$773.9 billion) in the first seven months of 2022, up 13.1 per cent year-on-year. This accounted for 15 per cent of China's total foreign trade. As of end-July 2022, China-Asean's cumulative two-way investment exceeded US$340 billion. And Chinese involvement in infrastructure projects in Asean totalled over US$380 billion by end-July, according to China Daily.",

    "Xi prepares to extend his reign at 20th Party Congress": "Hong Kong: Next month, Chairman Xi Jinping will extend his term in power for another five years, as the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) conducts its all-important 20th Party Congress.\n\nPerhaps only the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth II could compare to the pomp and ceremony that will accompany this congress in Beijing, with the weeklong conclave commencing on 16 October. It will be a highly orchestrated affair designed to showcase party solidarity, and to of course glorify the preeminence of Xi. Xi remains firmly in charge of the one-party state, despite swirling rumors - propagated it seems by the Falun Gong and some Indian media - that a coup had occurred in Beijing. Military columns approaching Beijing and mass cancellations of flights were cited as \"evidence\" of Xi being put under house arrest.\n\nThis is not the case, however, as rumor mills ramp up ahead of such important CCP events. A total of 2,296 delegates have been appointed to the 20th Party Congress, including just over 200 full members and approximately 170 alternate members. They will rubber stamp Xi's third five-year term in office, something unprecedented since the excesses of Mao Zedong's reign.\n\nXi has carved out a niche as paramount leader, with no regulatory end in sight for the end of his tenure. To borrow a quote from George Orwell's Animal Farm, \"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.\" Certainly, none is more equal than Xi. China's state constitution was amended in 2018 to eliminate any presidential limits, thus paving the way for Xi to remain in power indefinitely. Without doubt, Xi will retain his positions of CCP General Secretary and Chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC).\n\nIn November 2021, the Central Committee canonized Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, claiming that it embodies \"the best of the Chinese culture and ethos in our times and represents a new breakthrough in adapting Marxism to the Chinese context\". The Party Constitution is sure to be amended next month.\n\nExpected revisions will \"establish the position of comrade Xi Jinping as the core of the central party authorities and the core of the whole party\", and \"establish the overriding status of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era\". Xi's thoughts will be entrenched within the pantheon of CCP ideologies. Other revisions could be abolition of term limits for the CCP General Secretary and Chairman of the CMC; the Party Constitution does not currently stipulate the length of these two top posts. This is separate to the State Constitution, which was altered in 2018 to abolish the limit of two five-year terms.\n\nDoctor Willy Wo-Lap Lam, a Senior Fellow at The Jamestown Foundation think-tank in the USA, Lam offered this observation: \"Strongmen hate surprises - and will go the distance to ensure such events are carefully choreographed beforehand. This is why supreme leader Xi has repeatedly cautioned against 'black swans' appearing in Chinese politics. The putative Mao Zedong of the 21st century has solid confidence in the nation's artificial intelligence-assisted mass surveillance apparatus; so he has not been daunted by the spate of demonstrations that have broken out in several provinces over bank and real estate defaults and related scandals. Instead, most of Xi's energy has been consumed with finalizing personnel arrangements ahead of the 20th Party Congress that will consolidate the domination of his faction, and at the same time generate enough leeway to pacify opposition factions as well as party elders, many of whom have been disturbed by Xi's apparent Maoist restoration and his anti-US and anti-Western stance.\"\n\n\n\nCreative new ideas will thus not appear at this meeting. The congress' main purpose is to eulogize Xi and ensconce him as undisputed leader for a third term. Eschewing the policy of collective leadership introduced to prevent a recurrence of Mao's errors as \"Great Helmsman\", Xi opted to concentrate all decision-making power in his own hands. His hold over such areas as finance, foreign policy, personnel and ideology will be strengthened after the 20th Party Congress, despite the presence of the Communist Youth League Faction headed by Premier Li Keqiang, and the Shanghai Faction previously led by former president Jiang Zemin. In the coming five years, Xi's power will be even more absolute.\n\nThe Central Committee will decide the make-up of the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee and 25-member Politburo. Their two most prominent remaining Communist Youth League Faction members are Li and Vice Premier Hu Chunhua. However, it is likely that one will disappear, and quite possible that neither will remain after October's congress.\n\nIndeed, if Li retires and Hu is not offered a seat, this raises the specter of the Politburo Standing Committee being entirely dominated by Xi. Four candidates -all of whom are Xi's men - to occupy up to three vacant committee seats are Cai Qi, Li Qiang, Chen Min'er and Ding Xuexiang.\n\nYet, stacking the deck like this does not guarantee unity. There was dissension under Mao, and personal ambition will ensure jostling for position occurs under Xi too. If Li retires as premier, then perhaps the most likely replacement is the popular Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference chairman Wang Yang, who was Vice Premier from 2013-18.\n\nIt is difficult to imagine the Chinese elite revolting against Xi. Indeed, elites are more likely to flee the country and establish themselves elsewhere than they are to conduct coups. Similarly, Xi has the populace wrapped up tight with surveillance and internal security forces, so large-scale protest movements like that in 1989 are hard to conceive.\n\nThat is not to say that public grievances against Xi will not grow in the next term. Sixty-nine-year-old Xi will stay in power for at least another five years, and presumably for the next ten until the 22nd Party Congress in 2032. That means he feels he has plenty of time to appoint a successor, and nobody else dare propose one either.\n\nJohn S. Van Oudenaren, Editor-in-Chief of the China Brief at The Jamestown Foundation, commented: \"In the long term, Xi's inability or unwillingness to address the succession issue that plagues all non-monarchical, one-party states fosters immense uncertainty in the PRC system. Xi has rolled back the very modest progress made in the 1990s and 2000s to institutionalize the succession processes for the top-leadership posts. Moreover, the lack of a clear successor as Xi begins his second decade in power is likely to intensify the political maneuvering among sixth- and seventh-generation cadres as the general secretary enters old age.\"\n\nVan Oudenaren added, \"Even if Xi self-selects a successor, as Mao Zedong attempted to do several times, there is no guarantee that such an anointed future leader would have the political clout to take the reins, particularly if the prevailing sentiment among other party elites is to move in an ideological or strategic direction that is at odds with Xi's vision for China.\"\n\nFor his part, Lam assessed: \"The succession issue - as well as whether the CCP can cope with an unexpected event such as the sudden incapacitation of the supreme leader - is a taboo for the official media and heavily censored social media. Due to the longstanding rule of...retirement at 68...sixth-generation rising stars - officials born in the 1960s who would become Politburo Standing Committee members at the 20th or 21st Party Congress in 2027 - might end up being only transitional figures. The top prospects to fill this role include Xi's protege and principal adviser Ding Xuexiang (born 1962) and the Party Secretary of Chongqing, Chen Min'er (1960).\"\n\nThese two will be too old to assume power at the 22nd Party Congress under current protocols. On the other hand, potential successor candidates - those of the seventh generation born in the 1970s - have not yet really emerged or projected themselves on the political stage, since they are still middle-rank officials.\n\nWith Xi at the core of the party, his name enshrined in the Party Constitution, and his power base firmly controlled, the rest of the world can expect continuity of his policies, priorities and strategies. Deep in his being, Xi believes that the East - i.e. China - is rising, whilst the West is in decline. A Cold War has developed largely because of economic, geopolitical and technological competition with the USA. CCP efforts to usurp the US-led global order, to turn upside down established rules and norms, to establish military bases and illegally claim territory in the South China Sea, and its unstinting support of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, have set China on a pathway of confrontation.\n\nBy doing so, China has increasingly isolated itself from all but the most authoritarian of regimes. Xi has charted his course, and with a third term securely in the bag, the USA can expect intensified competition after the 20th Party Congress. Nonetheless, Xi faces significant challenges, including how China will handle COVID-19 now that the rest of the world has mostly learned to live with the pandemic. The country's dynamic zero-COVID policy is like an economic millstone around its neck.\n\nLam commented: \"In light of the CCP's lack of ballot box legitimacy, economic growth and overall public support - or at least acquiescence - are key elements of the party's legitimacy. Apart from...netizens paid to sing the party's praises on social media, a substantial portion of citizens are frustrated by problems including pandemic-related quarantines, growing unemployment, declining spending power on consumer goods, as well as the real estate and banking crises.\"\n\nXi will continue efforts already instituted to ameliorate some of these economic headwinds and to stimulate growth, plus the chairman needs to convince foreign investors not to withdraw from China's market. However, Lam pointed out that the State Council's preferred economic policy is simply a decades-old formula of boosting infrastructure spending at home, the side effect of which is massive government debt. Xi's promotion of a \"whole-country systemic approach\" and \"internal circulation\", amounting to reliance on China's domestic market to generate economic growth, does not suggest a return to Deng Xiaoping's market-oriented approach.\n\nChina's COVID-19 lockdowns are draconian. Yet to backtrack now would belie the CCP's narrative that its governance is superior to the West's. This policy has raised social discontent and stunted the economy, but China is unlikely to drastically alter its approach, at least until after March 2023 when the new government is sworn in.\n\nCertainly, early loosening of strict health protocols would cause COVID infections and deaths to explode, and this would cause political insecurity. Taiwan remains China's whipping boy, and Xi has enforced an even harder line against Taipei after US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan in August. Quite apart from a continuous tempo of warship and aircraft sorties, which now ignore the long-respected median line in the Taiwan Strait, Beijing's latest effort to ostracize Taiwan is to rewrite history in the United Nations.\n\nFor example, Zhang Meifang, China's Ambassador to Ireland, tweeted on 24 September: \"Over the past five decades, the UN has always referred to Taiwan as 'Taiwan, Province of China': this is Taiwan's only status in international law.\"\n\nHowever, this is a blatant lie, for the UN never describes Taiwan like this. The CCP is fraudulently \"altering\" UN documents in an attempt to turn its one-eyed claims into a reality. Not a single document of the UN Security Council or General Assembly support Beijing's claims, as it subverts international norms to achieve its own ends.\n\nThe CCP, in recent decades, has successfully depoliticized the Chinese masses, and encouraged them only to think of economic gain. Xi has never engendered universal popularity, but his anti-reformist policies, creation of a cult personality, rising unemployment, losses on the stock market and in real estate for the middle class, COVID-19 lockdowns and economic headwinds are all combining to tarnish Xi's aura.\n\nVain repetition and mouthing of vacuous slogans such as \"the great renaissance of the Chinese nation\" and the \"Chinese dream\" cannot dispel others' misgivings. If China cannot close the gap with the USA, then Xi's slogans will appear even emptier. Xi has set himself up as China's second Messiah, perhaps hoping to outpace Mao if he manages to secure Taiwan for his own and the CCP's glory. However, if he does not live up to the rhetoric, disappointment and resentment at home may grow. No matter what, the rest of the world will face continuing belligerence from China in the coming five years. (ANI)"
