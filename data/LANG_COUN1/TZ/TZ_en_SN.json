    "Senegal ferry disaster town remembers 20 years after 1,900 drowned": "Twenty years after Le Joola ferry sank, the Senegalese town where half of the nearly 1,900 dead lived will on Monday hold commemorations for a \"wound that never heals\".\n\nWhen news spread that the vessel had capsized on the night of September 26, 2002, no one in the southern city could believe it.\n\n\"It was unthinkable,\" said Nouha Cisse, who was head teacher at a secondary school in Ziguinchor that lost 150 pupils to the tragedy.\n\nA total of 1,863 people drowned or were lost -- surpassing the Titanic toll of more than 1,500 some 90 years earlier.\n\nLe Joola sailed into a storm off the coast of The Gambia on the way from Ziguinchor to the capital Dakar.\n\nThe ferry played a major role in the town in the isolated Casamance enclave, providing a lifeline to Dakar and transporting agricultural produce as well as tourists.\n\nThe Casamance, almost separated from the rest of Senegal by the tiny state of The Gambia, had since 1982 been wracked by a separatist rebellion. September 2002 saw a surge in attacks.\n\nOn September 26, more than 1,928 people officially crowded onto the ferry, which had a capacity of 536 passengers.\n\nVictims' associations say more than 2,000 passengers from more than a dozen countries died, and only 65 survived.\n\nWith crowds gathering at the port the morning after, the prime minister announced Le Joola had capsized.\n\n\"After that, it was unbearable in Ziguinchor,\" recalled Ibrahima Gassama, a journalist who covered the disaster for Sud FM radio.\n\n\"No one could console anyone. The gendarmes cordoned off the area because some people were threatening to throw themselves into the sea.\n\n\"They had lost everything,\" Gassama said.\n\n\"It really was a catastrophe,\" said 65-year-old Khadidiatou Diop, who lost her mother.\n\n\"In this house one person died, in that house another death, across the road one dead. It was like that all over Ziguinchor.\"\n\nFor Gassama, \"It's a wound that never heals.\n\n\"I don't think it ever can because the subsequent behaviour over the handling of the catastrophe was a second shipwreck.\"\n\nHe noted the rescue effort that only happened the next day and the official \"lies\", denying the high death toll.\n\nTwo decades on, many questions remain unanswered.\n\nThe causes of the incident have never been fully established, despite a Senegalese government inquiry and a French probe launched because of the deaths of 18 French citizens.\n\nEngine failure, a navigational error, bad weather, poor maintenance and overcrowding -- or a combination -- were likely to blame.\n\nSenegal closed the case in 2003 after concluding an investigation that blamed the captain, lost in the catastrophe.\n\nFrench courts also dismissed a years-long probe, which found evidence against seven Senegalese officials, concluding that Paris did not have jurisdiction.\n\nSenegalese and French victims' associations want the raising of the wreck of Le Joola, which sunk to a depth of some 20 metres (60 feet) and is thought to hold many bodies.\n\nThey also want a memorial erected. One was promised five years ago but the site is still nowhere near ready in Ziguinchor in time for Monday's anniversary.\n\nSenegalese victims' relatives have been compensated but President Macky Sall has never attended the annual anniversary remembrance.\n\nIn the town on the banks of the Casamance river, as at every anniversary of the sinking, \"everyone will gather to pray together\", noted Diop.\n\n\"But for those of us affected by this, it's the same every day. From 2002 till today, there has not been a day when I haven't thought about the boat,\" she said.",

    "Senegal: Dakar mayor loses bid to avoid jail": "A Senegalese appeal court on Wednesday confirmed a prison sentence handed down to the mayor of Dakar, convicted of killing a man during a wave of political violence.\n\nIn a politically-charged case, the court upheld the six-month prison term and 18-month suspended sentence.\n\nThe court \"confirms the judgement in all its provisions, dismisses the civil party in all its requests\", the presiding judge said.\n\nDakar Mayor Barthelemy Dias, a fierce opponent of President Macky Sall, had sought to overturn the sentence for the 2011 killing of a wrestler named Ndiaga Diouf during a rally that turned violent.\n\nDias, 46, was elected city mayor in February, riding a wave of support for leading opposition figure Ousmane Sonko, and there is speculation that he himself has presidential ambitions.\n\nPolice deployed in and around the courthouse and anti-riot vehicles were placed at key intersections of the capital.\n\nDias' lawyer Demba Cire Bathily said he would advise his client to lodge an appeal in cassation.\n\n\"The major implication is that his mayoral mandate isn't threatened,\" the lawyer said.\n\nThe implications for Dias' mandate as a parliamentarian were not an issue since \"the decision isn't final\", he added.\n\nDias was sentenced in 2017 to a six-month prison term and 18 months' suspended in a trial in which he appeared alongside a dozen other defendants.\n\nHis appeal began in March after having been postponed several times.",

    "Senegal: African Development Bank provides €29 million for development of road networks in 6 communes": "The Board of Directors of the African Development Bank Group has approved a €28.88 million loan for improvements to the road and transport network linking six Senegalese municipalities. The loan was approved on 20 September 2022.\n\nThe financing will be sourced from savings from the Senegal Cities Modernisation Programme.\n\nThe funds will support the construction of 28 kilometers of urban roads in asphalt concrete, paving stones and concrete. These works will complement earlier project achievements including the construction of 45.4 kilometers of asphalt roads, 21.6 kilometers of paved roads and the rehabilitation of 11.2 kilometers of asphalt roads.\n\nThe target areas are Yeumbel Nord (Dakar suburbs), Keur Massar and Guédiawaye (Dakar region), Thiès (West), Kaolack (Centre-West) and Saint-Louis (North-West).\n\nThe financing will also be used for drainage, public lighting, and the construction or repair of cabins that can be used as restaurants and sheds. An empowerment centre will also be set up to advance women’s and youth employment. Under the initiative, local authorities will receive training in geographic information systems, database management, planning, investment programming and procurement.\n\nThe programme is expected to improve the competitiveness of the beneficiary cities, which will be able to undertake planned growth. The support to Senegal's first Cities Modernisation Programme demonstrates the Bank's renewed approach to supporting the development of urban areas. This approach, which combines investment in infrastructure and institutional capacity building, is all the more important as it focuses on medium-sized and peripheral cities, thus contributing to regional rebalancing.\n\nLaunched in 2017 to boost decentralisation and drive Senegal’s economic and social development in the country, the first Cities Modernisation Programme received €114.34 million in financing from the African Development Bank. It covers 13 municipalities in the country: Diourbel, Kaolack, Kolda, Louga, Matam, Saint-Louis, Tambacounda, Thiès, Ziguinchor, Guediawaye, Keur Massar, Yeumbeul and Mbour.",

    "Landmark Lawsuit Filed Against Senegal Fish Meal Factory": "A Senegalese fisherman’s collective is suing the owners of a fish meal factory, which they say has polluted their village and destroyed their livelihoods. The lawsuit is the first of its kind and could set a precedent for other communities fighting against fish factories.\n\nSome 40 people assembled outside the courthouse in Thies, Senegal, on Thursday chanting protest slogans and holding banners that called for the closure of the factory in the town of Cayar.\n\nThe event marked what they had hoped would be the first day of legal proceedings between the Touba Protéine Marine fish meal factory and the fishermen’s Taxawu Cayar Collective. However, the case was postponed to October 6.\n\n“For any outsider who comes to Cayar, all they’d have to do is breathe to understand the difficulties we’re facing,” said Alle Sy, a member of the fisherman’s collective. “People have fallen ill, seriously ill. Our life is too hard now. We know we won’t be alone in this fight.”\n\nThe factory has also significantly decreased the value of their land, he added.\n\nThe Touba Protéine Marine factory, formerly known as Barna Senegal, is one of at least a half dozen fish meal factories that operate in the West African country.\n\nFish meal is dried, ground-up fish that is used as fertilizer or animal feed. According to the environmental group Greenpeace, the Touba factory has dumped increasing and illegal levels of heavy metals into Cayar’s land and water.\n\nCritics say fish meal factories have contributed to rising food insecurity throughout the region. They say the factories take fish that would otherwise be consumed locally and export them as fish meal to European and Asian markets, where it’s used to feed farm animals.\n\nBut Talla Gueye, the communications officer for the Touba factory, said the factory was established at a time when there was a surplus of fish being left on the beach.\n\nHe also refuted claims that the factory had polluted Cayar’s water.\n\n“The director and many of the workers live next to the factory, and no one has been diagnosed with illnesses due to the impacts of the factory,” he said. “The people of Cayar want this factory to stay because it creates a lot of employment.”\n\nDemba Bathily is the lawyer for the fisherman’s collective. He said the factory has been operating under the guise of bringing jobs and development to Cayar, when in reality, it only brings illness.\n\n“Today, it is social and economic rights that are being violated. It is the right to a clean environment that is being violated,” Bathily said. “And we want this to set an example — we want communities to understand that it is possible to stand up and fight for their rights.”\n\nMembers of Cayar’s fishermen collective said they plan to gather even more supporters and return to the courthouse in full force for next month’s meeting.",
    "Senegal leads way on women legislators but challenges ahead": "Senegal will break new ground Monday as West Africa's largest-ever proportion of women MPs take their seats in a newly elected legislature, stirring hopes of change in a country where patriarchal laws and attitudes are entrenched.\n\nMore than 44 percent of seats in Senegal's next National Assembly will be held by women -- the biggest share of any country in the region.\n\nBut hopes for dramatic progress on issues ranging from reproductive rights to domestic violence also have to be balanced with political reality.\n\nAminata Toure, a former prime minister and incoming MP for President Macky Sall's APR party, cautioned that in politics, female pioneers always encounter resistance and suspicion.\n\n\"You're much more scrutinised... they don't forgive you for any mistakes\", she told AFP. \"I think all women in power would tell you the same.\"\n\nSeventy-three out of 165 parliamentary seats will be held by women following elections in July across Senegal, widely viewed as a beacon of democracy and stability in a region marked by conflict and military rule.\n\nThe country ranks fourth in Africa and 18th in the world for gender parity in parliament, ahead of Switzerland, France, Britain and the US, according to the Geneva-based organisation the Inter-Parliamentary Union.\n\nOutside of Senegal, only 15 of 111 elected or appointed parliamentary or ministerial positions that opened in West Africa and the Sahel between December and June were filled by women, a UN report has said.\n\nSenegal's high share is explained by a 2010 law requiring \"absolute gender parity\" in all elective institutions, with candidate lists alternating between men and women.\n\nThe latest tally of legislators is two more than previously, and the highest ever under the parity rules.\n\nThe law \"allows women to have a say on the national budget, express the concerns and needs of women in parliament and show society that women are equally qualified,\" said Toure.\n\nWomen \"can bring another culture of governing\".\n\nCandidate lists are often topped by men and, when they are odd-numbered, tend to have one more man than woman, which explains why female representation remains below 50 percent, a National Assembly spokeswoman said.\n\n- Incremental change -\n\nActivists point to a mountain of tasks in a country that ranks a lowly 130th out of 189 states on a UN gender equality index.\n\nBut efforts to fix them under the new assembly are likely to be incremental.\n\nRape was only criminalized in 2020, and national laws have yet to fully implement the Maputo Protocol, an African Union initiative to widen abortion access that Senegal ratified in 2005.\n\nIt obliges state parties to allow abortion in cases of rape and incest, among others.\n\nBut in Senegal, abortion is only permitted to save a pregnant woman's life, said Aissatou Ywa of Task Force, an alliance of civil society and medical associations campaigning for rape and incest to be included.\n\nIn 2020, one-quarter of the female prison population had been jailed for abortion-related crimes, according to the NGO Africa Check, quoting data provided by Senegal's penitentiary administrators.\n\nOther campaign groups are pushing for legal changes that would raise the age of marriage for girls to 18 from 16. The legal age of marriage is already 18 for men.\n\n\"It should be raised to 18 for girls to enable them to continue school and be on the same footing, in terms of rights, as boys\", said Maimouna Yade, head of the women's organization JGEN.\n\nCampaigners are also pushing to allow mothers to have the same parental authority under the law as fathers.\n\n\"There are so many things to do,\" said Mame Diarra Fam, an incoming MP for the opposition Senegalese Democratic Party.\n\nShe highlighted violence against women, education for girls and access to health, following a string of headline-making tragedies in maternity clinics over the last 18 months.\n\n- Test ahead -\n\nAdvocates and MPs credit the parity law for several success stories.\n\nIn 2013, parliament enacted a law allowing Senegalese women married to foreigners to pass their nationality onto their children, a right that was already permitted for Senegalese men.\n\nToure had introduced the bill as justice minister.\n\nAnother breakthrough was legislation criminalizing rape -- a law \"largely pushed\" by female MPs, said Yade.\n\nWhether women's rising numbers in parliament translates into executive clout will soon face a key test.\n\nSall will be scrutinized to see if he names a woman to the role of prime minister, a position that he had abolished in 2019 under the country's presidential system.\n\nSenegal's first woman prime minister was Mame Madior Boye, who served from 2001 to 2002. She was followed by Toure, in office from 2013 to 2014.\n\nAnother issue is how many women Sall will name to ministerial jobs. Toure is among those wanting parity to be extended to the cabinet and even to the private sector.\n\nCivil society groups meanwhile are campaigning hard for a female speaker of the assembly, a role never held by a woman.\n\n\"We really want a woman leading the 2022-2027 parliament\", said Coumba Gueye, executive secretary of the Association of Senegalese Women Lawyers. \"If we have a woman, a lot of things can be changed.\"",

Mane – who left Liverpool in the summer after he scored 120 goals in 269 appearances - started brightly for Bayer Munich as he scored in four straight games at the beginning of the season.\n\nHowever, he is yet to find the back of the net for the Bavarians in their last six matches. The former Southampton forward has scored five goals in 11 matches in all competitions, but only three have come in the Bundesliga.\n\nHe has been mostly utilized as a centre-forward and at times on the left wing, and Lahm questions these positional changes for Mane.\n\nWHAT HAS BEEN SAID: \"Mane’s qualities are out of question,\" Lahm said, as quoted by Liverpool Echo. \"But it’s crucial that roles must be clearly assigned.\n\n\"I don’t see that at the moment. I currently don’t understand how the roles are defined. Everyone has to know what they have to do on the pitch.\"\n\nTHE BIGGER PICTURE: In Bayern Munich’s 4-2-3-1 formation, Mane has mostly operated as a centre-forward and the only time he was not deployed as such was during the Uefa Champions League match against Barcelona.\n\nThen he took up a left-sided role, which he played most of the time when he was at Liverpool.\n\nMane’s recent struggles in Germany are a general reflection of the club; Bayern have now gone four matches without a win in the Bundesliga.\n\nLahm’s concerns come after Dietmar Hamann claimed Mane has not been integrated at Bayern.\n\nWHAT IS NEXT FOR MANE: Currently, he is with Senegal during the Fifa international break friendlies. He scored - his 34th goal for his country and his first goal since August - as Teranga Lions defeated Bolivia 2-0 in their first friendly.\n\nThey are set to face Iran on Tuesday in another pre-World Cup test match. Thereafter, the reigning Men’s Caf Player of the Year will return to Bayern Munich and focus on club duties.",
    "Senegal’s pink lake threatened by flood after heavy rains": "Senegal, like other countries in the West and Central Africa region, has recorded above-normal rainfall in recent weeks that has unleashed destructive floods\n\nAfter days of torrential rain, salt miner Moussa Diare could only watch in despair as flood waters breached a meters-wide gap on the banks of Senegal’s Pink Lake and washed away thousands of dollars worth of salt mounds he had gathered.\n\n“This is the first time I’ve seen this. I lost a lot of money with my salt that has been washed and dissolved by the water,” Diare said on Tuesday.\n\nSenegal, like other countries in the West and Central Africa region, has recorded above-normal rainfall in recent weeks that has unleashed destructive floods after poor drainage systems failed.\n\nThe lake, separated by a strip of dunes from the Atlantic Ocean, is situated approximately 35 kilometres (20 miles) from Senegal’s capital Dakar. It is one of the country’s most-visited sites and is under consideration as a UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\nOfficially known as Lake Retba, it derives its pinkish hue from an alga that produces the coloured pigment, and like the Dead Sea, is also known for its high salt content.\n\nDiare is one of more than 3,000 people who earn a living from the lake, including hundreds of divers who manually rake salt from the bottom of the lake, producing about 38,000 tonnes annually. The salt is used for cooking and exported around the region.\n\nAs persistent rains drenched Senegal, with approximately 126 millimetres (five inches) recorded during one spell over the past weekend, according to the Water and Sanitation Ministry, drainage systems and retention reservoirs were quickly overwhelmed and channelled flood waters towards the lake.\n\nAccording to Senegal’s civil aviation and meteorological agency, rainfall above 50mm (1.9 inches) in the country is considered “extreme”.\n\nAs the flows reached the lake, the water level rose, washing away dozens of salt mounds, said Babacar Ba, another miner who was trying to save his remaining mounds.\n\nAbdoulaye Faty, a hydrologist and lecturer at Dakar’s Cheikh Anta Diop University, told the Reuters news agency that rising water levels in surrounding plateaux naturally pooled into the low-lying lake.\n\nBecause the lake has received abundant flood water, it could have an effect on its salt content and colour, he added.\n\nWith a month to go before the end of Senegal’s June – October rainy season, other businesses around the lake, including restaurants and flat-bottom boat operators, who take tourists on tours of the lake, are counting their losses and worried about the future.\n\n“What appealed to visitors was the feeling of floating on the surface of the lake because of its salt content. Currently, no one can float here,” said Abdou Seye Dieng who runs a campsite on the shores.\n\nThe government has activated a national plan to help communities hit by perennial floods, and a mission from the Water and Sanitation Ministry is expected to visit the lake soon.",

Tension was high and MPs highly strung.

    "Here's a list of demands from Senegal's Macky Sall at UNGA 2022 — Quartz Africa": "Macky Sall, the president of Senegal and chair of the African Union, sent a direct message to his fellow world leaders: Africa does not want to be the battleground for a proxy war between nations on opposing sides of the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nIt was one of the highlights of his address yesterday (Sept. 20) at this year’s United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York.\n\n“I have come to say that Africa has suffered enough of the burden of history,” said Sall who has become the loudest African voice advocating for an equal seat for the continent at crucial decision-making tables. Rather than be the stage for another Cold War, Africa wants to be a “pole of stability and opportunity open to all its partners, on a mutually beneficial basis,” he said.\n\nAfrica demands to exit the sidelines\n\nSall’s remarks come within the last fortnight of reflection on Africa’s place in the world following the passing of the last British monarch to have colonial subjects on the continent.\n\nIn the decades since the drastic dilution of the British Empire, the postcolonial world shepherded by the United Nations has prioritized so-called world powers at its highest decision making levels. The UN’s security council is the prime example: its five permanent member countries, none African, hold powers of veto that affect how UN bodies intervene on the continent’s critical peace and security matters.\n\n\n\nSall reminded his colleagues that Africa wants to change this, citing the Ezulwini Consensus where African leaders demanded two permanent seats on the security council. Granting that wish, in addition to a G20 seat, will show the world is prepared to “overcome the reluctance and deconstruct the narratives that persist in confining Africa to the margins of decision-making circles.”\n\nCredit rating agencies must treat Africa better\n\nThe African Union is marching towards setting up a credit rating agency for the continent, and the effort has the backing of member countries. But meanwhile, the body wants fairer treatment from the big three agencies when they evaluate African governments’ international fundraising efforts (typically through eurobonds).\n\nDominant in the US thanks to their legally protected status, Standard & Poor’s (S&P), Moody’s, and Fitch have extended their reach to assess African governments and businesses, often resulting in dissatisfaction. GCR, the continent’s major ratings agency, was bought by Moody’s earlier this year, cementing the big three’s market share.\n\nSall expressed concern that “the perception of risk in Africa continues to be higher than the actual risk,” causing high insurance premiums and making African economies appear unattractive to investors. He cited an IMF and World Bank-assisted report that urged Moody’s and the other agencies to be more transparent with their methodologies “so as not to undermine confidence in ratings.”\n\nSenegal wants to explore its oil and gas reserves\n\nIn addition to calling for an end to sanctions against Zimbabwe, Sall’s other major submission at UNGA is one he has championed arguably for what it could do for his native Senegal: that African countries should exploit existing oil and gas reserves, even as the continent remains committed to the ideals of the Paris Climate Agreement.\n\nAngola and Nigeria are among Africa’s oil dependent economies, even if decades of exploitation have failed to correlate with world-class quality of life or high income. A trail of environmental damage has followed too, as new reports from Nigeria’s riverine areas show. Still, “the continent that pollutes the least and lags furthest behind in the industrialisation process should exploit its available resources,” Sall said, pointing to the 600 million Africans without electricity.\n\nOffshore oil production in Senegal is set to begin in 2023 at the rate of up to 120,000 barrels a day from a reserve of 2.5 billion barrels.\n\nWhether the country’s state-run company will avoid the pitfalls that have dogged its more experienced west African neighbor remains to be seen. But Sall’s demand is that Africa, faced with development challenges that for the most part barely affect wealthier western countries, would like to not be barred from putting its resources to use.\n\n“We want a multilateralism that is open and respectful of our differences,” he said, “because the United Nations system, born out of the ashes of war, can only win the support of all on the basis of shared ideals, not local values erected as universal norms.”",

    "Senegal - African Development Fund Replenishment Meeting: Delegates visit rice fields and interact with beneficiaries of projects financed by the Fund": "On Thursday, 15 September 2022, the farmers of the Baboulaye Valley in western Senegal welcomed special visitors. Delegates from the African Development Fund (ADF), the African Development Bank Group's concessional lending arm for the continent’s low-income countries, visited this agricultural plain in Diofior province, 150 km from the capital, Dakar.\n\nDelegates representing the Fund's development partners visited the rice fields in the Baboulaye Valley and engaged in lively discussion with the farmers and other beneficiaries of projects the Fund has financed.\n\nThe visit formed part of African Development Fund (ADF-16) replenishment meetings taking place in Dakar from the 15th to the 17th of September.\n\nLocated in the Sine Saloum, one of Senegal’s richest agricultural regions, much of the arable land in the Baboulaye valley nonetheless used to have a highly saline water table, which deprived the rural population of a primary source of subsistence.\n\nOn their way to meet farmers, delegates from the African Development Fund witnessed the results achieved in the fight against salt encroachment.\n\nAs their vehicles rolled along the nearly one-kilometer-long anti-salt dam, the visitors were struck by the lush green rice plots stretching as far as the eye could see. As a result of the separation of the salt strip from the farmlands, these soils, it was explained, had been entirely abandoned by farmers, depressed at not being able to work on them.\n\nYounoussa Mballo, coordinator of the Programme to Build Resilience to Food and Nutrition Insecurity in the Sahel, was the guide for the day. He explained the huge efforts that had been undertaken, with the help of partners such as the National Agency for Agricultural and Rural Consultancy, the Senegalese Institute for Agricultural Research, and the relevant government agencies, to reclaim these lands and anchor the farmers on the land. The African Development Fund financed the program.\n\n\"Before this Baboulaye Valley project, agricultural yields were around one tonne per hectare,\" he said. \"Following its implementation in 2011, it has increased to 3 tonnes per hectare and even 5 tonnes in some areas.\" The partnership with the Senegalese Institute of Agricultural Research has made it possible to develop the high-yielding ISRIZ10 rice variety that can adapt to salty soil.\"\n\nVeronika Baumgartner Putz, the Fund's delegate for Austria, said she was pleased \"to see what has been achieved on the ground and to see how the financing by the African Development Fund has been spent. Good partnerships and better project quality at entry help to build the sustainability of projects for the beneficiaries,\" she said.\n\nDelegates from China, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Kuwait, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, the Republic of Korea, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United States were also on the trip.\n\nFor Marie-Laure Akin-Olugbade, The Africa Development Bank’s Acting Vice President for Regional Development, Integration and Business Delivery, the field trip was an important moment in the relationship between the Bank Group, partners, and beneficiaries.\n\nA few hours later, the convoy entered the town of Diofior, for an exhibition of project beneficiaries’ goods, including rice, honey, local juices, textiles, flour products, handicrafts, and even solar-powered photovoltaic fiber equipment.\n\nThe provincial mayor, Youssou Diom and members of his municipal council and local farmers received the guests. \"Thanks to the efforts that have been made , 1,500 hectares of land are currently available for the population. This is an important step towards food self-sufficiency in our municipality,\" Diom said.\n\n\"The Baboulaye valley has become our granary,\" said Babou Gningue, a farmer who met the Fund delegates. \"The reclaimed land is now available for rainfed rice cultivation with a management system that allows for water retention for about three months,\" he explained.\n\nThe African Development Fund provides low-income African countries with grants, concessional loans, guarantees, and technical assistance. The aim is to reduce poverty and establish sustainable and inclusive development.",

The Association \"renews (its) support to their colleague who officiates (hundreds) of km from Dakar in extremely difficult working conditions,\" according to the statement.\n\nAccording to the Senegalese press, Dioura Diallo, in a very advanced state of pregnancy and whose age was not specified, presented herself on Tuesday evening at the health center. She died after bleeding profusely and following a botched caesarean section during which the baby suffered injuries before dying, according to the press.\n\nThis case echoes another that caused a stir.

    "Senegal: Civil society and human right defenders mobilize for a transparent election": "“As a human rights defender, it is important that we can help mobilise young people to become more involved in defending their civil and political rights,” said Jaly Badiane, a Senegalese human rights activist and blogger.\n\nBadiane was part of Senegal Vote, a “civi-tech” initiative that combined citizen engagement and the use of ICT to encourage participation in the country’s recent election especially among younger people. The initiative was led by Wa Mbedmi (“those in the street” in Wolof”) a non-profit entity created to contribute to the emergence of a participatory citizenship.\n\n\"As an associative and non-partisan entity, the Wa Mbedmi Association, which, works daily to promote the emergence of a citizen who is interested in public life, challenges those in power and engages in collaborative and community dynamics,” Badiane said. \"The goal of our citizen initiative is to make all relevant electoral information understandable, in a language that is accessible to a large number of citizen voters.”\n\nIndeed, in order to guarantee the fairness of the 2022 legislative election Senegal, human rights defenders, as well as members of civil society groups worked tirelessly to ensure free, fair, and transparent elections.

    "Senegal seeks to cash in on global dash for gas": "President Macky Sall of Senegal has become a popular figure on the international stage. His country’s gas reserves, from which exports are due to start in the next couple of years, are now the target of intense interest by European leaders desperate to find alternatives to Russian gas following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nWhen German Chancellor Olaf Scholz visited Senegal in May, he said securing LNG supply from the country was “a matter worth pursuing intensively”. The UK is already heavily involved in the offshore sector, where BP is the operator for the gas export projects. The EU’s energy commissioner dropped into Dakar earlier in the year.\n\nPolish President Andrzej Duda visited Senegal and fellow African hydrocarbons producers Nigeria and Cote d’Ivoire in early September to discuss the energy crisis among other topics – Poland’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal has already received its first shipment of Nigerian LNG and is keen to secure future supply.\n\nSall, for his part, has been playing up Europe as a destination for LNG, noting that Senegal’s position at the western extremity of Africa puts it just a few days’ shipping time from European markets, while also suggesting there would be competition from Asian buyers.\n\nRelated article\n\nSall’s strategy pays off\n\nThis keen interest highlights the shrewdness of Sall’s decision to prioritise easier-to-fund and faster-to-build offshore hydrocarbon export developments over more costly large-scale projects with more onshore facilities and more early-stage gas going to the domestic market.\n\nBy agreeing to deals that kept the upfront operational and financial costs and risks to levels deemed acceptable for international oil companies (IOCs), Senegal is now on course to be a gas exporter by 2023, with enough production to serve markets abroad and at home for decades if demand holds up.\n\nThat would be just eight years after commercial gas reserves were discovered in Senegalese waters – a fast turnaround in the context of African hydrocarbons projects. The norm on the continent is years of delays to projects due to financial disagreements and political uncertainties, especially in states such as Senegal with no track record of oil and gas production.\n\nSenegal’s history of political and economic stability and good international relations along with Sall’s background as a geological engineer with hands-on experience of the hydrocarbons industry have all played their part in smoothing the way for gas development.\n\nRelated article\n\nFirst gas production due in 2023\n\nSenegal’s first exports will come from reserves straddling the maritime border with Mauritania in deep water. These are being developed on behalf of both countries by BP and its partner Kosmos Energy in the Greater Tortue Ahmeyin (GTA) project, the product of successful cooperation between two politically, culturally and economically distinct neighbouring countries.\n\nFor Phase 1 of the project, BP is using a 2.5m tonnes/year floating LNG production facility, which is fed by pipeline from a floating production, storage and offloading vessel (FPSO) over the field. Most of this output will go for export. The field has an estimated gas production potential of around 15 trillion cubic feet – enough for at least 30 years of production, according to BP.\n\nDespite Covid-related construction delays for the FPSO, which is being built by Cosco in China under contract to Technip, first production is still expected by end-2023.\n\nA final investment decision on developing Phase 2 of the project is due before the end of 2022. The concept for that has yet to be finalised, but it could be another similar-sized floating LNG (FLNG) project.\n\nRelated article\n\nSenegal also has another commercial find further south, entirely in its own waters, called Yakaar-Teranga, which is also being developed by BP and Kosmos. This find is estimated to hold around 20 trillion cubic feet of gas.\n\nIt is with Yakaar-Teranga that the economic boost for Senegal beyond the impact of export revenues will kick in. President Sall has said around half of production from the development would go to the domestic market as feedstock for power stations, fertiliser and ammonia plants and other industries, with the rest going for export.\n\nA final investment decision for Yakaar-Teranga is also expected in the next few months with production possible by 2024, potentially using a similar set up of FPSO and FLNG vessel as deployed at GTA, with the addition of a gas pipeline to shore to serve domestic customers.\n\nIn addition to the gas developments, Senegal is also set to become an oil producer. Australia’s Woodside is due to start production in 2023 from a 100,000 barrels/day FPSO on the Sangomar field, 100km offshore from the capital Dakar. A second phase of that project, which is likely to be of a similar size and cost around $2.5bn, is planned, though no development timetable has been published yet.\n\nRelated article\n\nFuture challenges\n\nWhile the short-term prospects for hydrocarbons exports are positive, due to the impact of the Ukraine war on global supply, the risk remains that that freshly discovered reserves in Senegal and elsewhere may be not be exploited to their full potential if global fossil fuel demand falls in the next 10-20 years.\n\nSall, who is the current chairperson of the African Union under a rotating system, is one of several African leaders calling for natural gas to be regarded as a legitimate transition fuel for African nations.\n\nDespite the progress with Senegal’s hydrocarbon’s projects and a buoyant global energy market for producers, it hasn’t been plain sailing for Sall at home. The government has been criticised by international non-governmental organisations and opposition parties for a lack of transparency in drawing up some oil and gas contracts with foreign firms in the past.\n\nSall’s ruling coalition is less popular at the polls than it was, winning only a narrow victory in legislative elections in August 2022, against a backdrop of economic adversity for many Senegalese due to the impact of the Covid pandemic and high fuel prices, as well as accusations that opposition politicians are being muzzled.\n\nThere is also concern that Sall has yet to rule out standing for a third time in presidential elections in 2024, despite a two-term limit under the existing constitution. However, the risk of losing, given the opposition’s growing electoral strength, may yet deter him, according to regional analysts.\n\nBut whoever is president after the next election should have access to the country’s first oil and gas revenues to bolster opportunities for economic growth.",

We therefore urge the Council to engage more with us in the fight against terrorism in Africa and to do this with more appropriate mandates and more substantial resources,” said President Sall.\n\nMore African leaders are scheduled to address the General Assembly in the hours ahead.",

He was charged and placed under a detention order for the offences of insulting the head of state (article 80 of the penal code), dissemination of false news (article 255 of the penal code and defamation (article 258 du code penal). After almost a month in detention, Abdou Bara Dolly was finally granted provisional freedom on 8 July 2022 He remains at the disposal of the court for his trial.\n\nOn 3 August 2022, Pape Ibra Guèye, also known as Papito Kara, a social media activist, was arrested for the offence of disseminating false news, and for deletion, modification, fabrication and use of computer data to publish headlines from media outlets and newspapers before they were made public by the outlets. Press groups filed a complaint after the headlines were published on social media. He remains in detention.\n\nA few days later, activist Outmane Diagne was arrested and detained for spreading false news, and for deleting and modifying newspaper data. This happened after he shared the front pages of satirical newspapers on his Facebook page, along with 3 smiley face emojis. He also remains in custody at this time.\n\nOn 8 September 2022, Abdou Karim Gueye and Cheikh Oumar Diagne were placed in police custody following remarks made after the death of an imam, Alioune Badara Ndao, during a TV programme. The two defendants accused the State of being the root cause of Imam Ndao’s illness. They were taken into custody on 12 September and charged for ‘broadcasting false news’. They remain in custody today.\n\n“This tendency of Senegalese authorities to deny criticism and muzzle dissenting voices and freedom of expression flouts the fundamentals of democracy. The chilling and deterrent effect of these practices on activists, civil society organisations, the media, and others encourages self-censorship. The fundamental values of democracy and freedoms that the country has taken years to acquire must be preserved,” said David Diaz-Jogeix, Senior Director of Programmes at ARTICLE 19.\n\nARTICLE 19 reminds the Senegalese authorities of their obligation under Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which provides that ‘everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice’.\n\nARTICLE 19 further reminds the Senegalese authorities that restrictions on freedom of expression are permissible only if they comply strictly with the three-part test established under Article 19(3) of the ICCPR. They must meet the requirement of legality (which requires that the legal basis for the restriction be clear, accessible and predictable), pursue a legitimate aim, and be necessary and proportionate to achieving that aim.\n\nIn particular, the criminalisation of protected expression such as satire, criticism towards the State or public officials constitutes a violation of Article 19. In addition, the principle of proportionality mandates that criminalisation of speech always be an exceptional and last resort and that restrictions on the right to freedom of expression ‘must be the least intrusive instrument amongst those which might achieve their protective function’ (Human Rights Committee, General Comment No. 34, paragraph 34).\n\nFor more information, please contact:\n\nMaateuw Mbaye, Program Assistant, ARTICLE 19 Senegal/West Africa Email: [email protected] T: +221785958337\n\nAissata Diallo Dieng, Office Manager, ARTICLE 19 Senegal/West Africa Email: [email protected] T:+221338690322\n\nSenegal is ranked 50 out of 161 countries in the 2022 Global Expression Report – ARTICLE 19’s annual review of the state of freedom of expression and the right to information around the world.",

It shows the person he is. I don't think I need to praise him more yet, we all know him. The fact that Sadio Mane is asking for you to help the people is obviously a defining moment in my life.”\n\nTHE BIGGER PICTURE: The 26-year-old received his maiden call-up to the Senegal squad when coach Aliou Cisse named him in the Teranga Lions team for friendly matches against Bolivia and Iran this month.\n\nWHAT NEXT FOR NIAKHATE?

The protest follows recent strike action to demand increased wages and an improvement in working conditions.\n\nHeightened security is likely in the vicinity of the protest. The protest action and security force response, which could include road closures, could result in ground travel and business operation disruptions. Demonstrators could march in nearby streets before and after the planned start of the event. Clashes between demonstrators and police are possible if protesters engage in acts of public violence, are overly disruptive, or if they ignore police orders to disperse. There is an incidental threat to bystanders should any violence occur.\n\nAdvice\n\nAvoid the protest as a standard precaution and to mitigate likely ground travel delays. Plan for road travel delays in and near the protest area. Heed instructions from the security forces. If any violence erupts nearby, immediately depart the area and seek shelter at a non-government building.",

    "Senegal Tech Firms See Gains at Europe’s Biggest Startup Event": "Positioning Senegal as an African digital powerhouse\n\nSince 2016, VivaTech has made its mark as the European epicenter of innovation and digital technology. With more than 2,000 exhibitors from across the globe, the trade show offers unparalleled access to international customers, major investors and new markets.\n\nSenegal has emerged as one of Africa’s five main tech hubs, making the event from 15 to 18 June a key opportunity. The country’s most promising startups went to Paris with support from the NTF V project, the French Embassy in Dakar, and the Senegalese government’s agency for entrepreneurship – known as the Délégation générale à l’Entreprenariat Rapide des Femmes et des Jeunes (DER/FJ).\n\nIn just a few days, these “Tech Lions” initiated more than 37 deals. According to DER/FJ’s Carine Vavasseur, these excellent results validate the attractiveness of Senegal’s tech ecosystem.\n\n“Senegal is at the crossroads of French-speaking Africa, with mature start-ups that are ready to be exported. Our well-organized business environment facilitates collaborations,” said Vavasseur, the head of innovation and ecosystem coordination at DER/FJ.\n\n“The creation of the Mohamed Bin Zayed hub for entrepreneurship and innovation is proof of this. Senegal is attracting more and more investors, but also companies from all over the continent which are interested in our innovation platform. Senegal is in a state of dynamic openness. And this is what we would like to demonstrate by participating in international events such as VivaTech.”\n\n\n\nFeeding inspiration and growing the network\n\nSince founding Logidoo two years ago, Tamsir Ousmane Traore has revolutionized logistics in West Africa. His award-winning platform has become the region’s go-to platform for transport.\n\nBy 2023, Logidoo plans to expand its franchise network to 13 African countries. Traore visited VivaTech amid his drive to raise 1.5 million euros to finance that growth.\n\nHis trip to Paris let him meet leading investors and take the pulse of global innovations.\n\n“The day before VivaTech, the Viva AfricArena conference took place. We were able to visit Station F, one of the most prestigious start-up campuses in the world. To see what others are doing and where the world is heading is inspiring, and essential for staying in the race.”\n\nIn the following days, Logidoo had many meetings at the VivaTech booth.\n\n“Many partners wanted to meet, and VivaTech gave us the space to do so. We also had the opportunity to identify prospects and attract new operators,” Logidoo said.\n\n“Thanks to VivaTech, we recruited our franchisee for the Congolese market. Participating in such big events means being able to show off, interact with the community and grow your networks. This is what the NTF V project helps us do. If we want to meet our growth objectives and add new functionalities to our solutions in the future, such support is essential.”\n\n\n\nAbout the project\n\nThe Netherlands Trust Fund V (NTF) (July 2021 – June 2025) is based on a partnership between the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the International Trade Centre.

    "Refugee Protection Specialist - level P3 (International Consultant) - Senegal": "Operational Context\n\nMembers of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) [1] have demonstrated their leadership in refugee protection by becoming parties, to the exception of one of them, to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol and the 1969 Organization of African Unity (OAU) Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa. The 15 States have all adopted laws and/or regulations in order to make effective the exercise of the right to seek asylum on their territory and to access and enjoy solutions. Except for one of them (Cape Verde), all have established their own national procedures to carry out individual refugee status determination (RSD).\n\nDespite these considerable efforts, some gaps remain to align with international and regional refugee protection law and standards, to maximize the best practices and to better explore the opportunities offered by the ECOWAS Protocol on Free Movements of Persons, Right of Residence and right of establishment.\n\nImpaired protection and solutions systems contribute to risky onward movements of refugees and asylum-seekers, within the region or from the region to North Africa and Europe. Protection risks en route include sexual and gender-based violence, abduction, unlawful detention, torture and death. In order to address some of the limitations in the national asylum systems and create a regional framework that would inspire not only law reform but also implementation of protection and solutions to refugees, ECOWAS with the support of UNHCR will adopt Common Minimum Standards on refugee protection and solutions.\n\nThe proposed common minimum standards seek to use (i) ECOWAS’ existing humanitarian mandate, (ii) the provisions of the Treaty and Protocols, (iii) its continuous commitment to refugee protection and solutions.\n\nOverall, Purpose and Scope of Assignment\n\nThe envisaged directive providing common minimum standards will be developed and adopted under the leadership of ECOWAS, with the support of UNHCR.\n\nThe proposed directive providing common minimum standards present three main characteristics:\n\n1. A profound shift in refugee protection systems: These common minimum standards would serve to promote the institutionalization of the asylum process and response through building or strengthening institutional capacity of the existing refugee commissions. While commending the prima facie recognition that is used by most of countries in the region, one can also note that some countries lack a strong tradition of individual asylum processing mechanism or structure. Consequently, asylum legislations in some countries in the region do not systematically deal with asylum processes and procedures in details, nor do they always regulate the composition and the mode of operation of eligibility commissions.\n\n2. A focus on solutions: Common minimum standards should deal with the entire protection cycle, from the entry on the territory of asylum to the search for a durable solution, and include: (i) registration and refugee status determination procedures; (ii) rights of and available services for asylum-seekers throughout these processes, such as reception, targeted assistance and legal counselling; (iii) rights of and available services for refugees upon receiving their status, namely access to documentation, education, health care, social welfare, employment, legal counselling, justice or financial institutions. The region has a very good record of solutions best practices, and it is important to draw on the positive experience and institutionalize it across the region, hence the need for an harmonized approach. References could be made to existing ECOWAS initiatives such as the new ECOWAS National Biometric Identity Card created to facilitate the freedom of movement for ECOWAS citizens within the Economic Community by serving as a passport, a residency permit, a proof of identity and other purposes depending on the Member State, for instance as a voter's card in Senegal [2]. The principle of freedom of movement and the right to establish offer even better prospects to enhance these dimensions and so do related policies on access to education, health etc.\n\n3. The preservation of the civilian and humanitarian character of asylum: Considering the ongoing armed conflicts in the region, including in the Central Sahel and in the Lake Chad Basin, the envisaged common minimum standards will seek to maintain the civilian and humanitarian character of asylum. Military activities are by nature incompatible with the civilian character of asylum and persons identified as fighters or combatants cannot be admitted into refugee status determination procedures unless they have genuinely and permanently renounced such activities.\n\nIn the spirit of the Global Compact on Refugees, UNHCR strategic goal is the harmonization of protection and solutions to ensure refugees adequate access to their rights and the ECOWAS integration agenda and framework of freedom of movement offers a favorable context.\n\nDuties and Responsibilities\n\nUnder the joint supervision of the UNHCR Regional Bureau for West and Central Africa and ECOWAS, the consultant will:\n\nCarry out a comprehensive desk review of existing legislations, regulations and soft law in all 15 ECOWAS States relating to refugee protection and solutions (e.g. status determination procedures, rights of asylum-seekers and refugees, available services), including through interviews with key informants;\n\nAssess and present potential gaps and discrepancies between the normative frameworks and their implementation.\n\nIdentify gaps with regard to compliance with international and regional refugee law as well as other relevant frameworks (e.g., Global compact on refugees), including through interviews with key informants (e.g., UNHCR Country Operations, national eligibility commissions);\n\nIdentify and compile practical tools developed and/or used by ECOWAS states in the context of refugee protection and solution, including screening tools and forms.\n\nMap out good practices within the region in line with international and regional refugee law as well as other relevant frameworks.\n\nIdentify good practices and lessons learnt from other regional protection and solutions schemes and regimes.\n\nDefine the appropriate ECOWAS legal basis, instrument and process to be used to effectively and timely adopt common minimum standards.\n\nDraft a model law model on refugee protection and solutions.\n\nExpected Deliverables\n\nCompilation of all relevant laws, regulations and soft law within the Economic Community of West African States (database).\n\nReport highlighting (a) gaps, (b) good practices in the region, (c) good practices from other regional asylum frameworks, (d) a set of recommendations\n\nCommon minimum standards on refugee protection and solutions within ECOWAS\n\nA model law on asylum and solutions for refugees\n\nAll deliverables shall be in French and key summaries in English.\n\nMinimum Qualifications\n\nAn Advanced University degree in Law, Public International Law, Political Science or Public Policy with a very good knowledge of international refugee law, regional refugee frameworks, the ECOWAS institutional framework, and trends and challenges associated with mixed movements in West Africa;\n\nDemonstrated research, analytical and report writing skills, preferably in the area of refugee protection.\n\nFluency in French and English.\n\nAbility to work in a multi-cultural environment.\n\nminimum 10 ans dans le domaine de la protection des refugies et de la reforme du systeme asilaire.\n\nLocation and Conditions\n\nFull-time position with 40 working hours per week.\n\nThe Individual Consultant will work remotely from home.

    "Senegal vs Netherlands Predictions: World Cup Group Stage Odds & Best Bets": "Senegal vs Netherlands Predictions: World Cup Group Stage Odds & Best Bets\n\nNetherlands are strong favourites to claim a win in their first World Cup match in Qatar but there could be value in backing Senegal to score\n\nThe two favorites in Group A start off their tournament with a pivotal clash that could have major ramifications on which teams advance here. It can be difficult to recover from an opening loss, especially with only two more fixtures after this one.\n\nNetherlands turned in an impressive performance during UEFA World Cup qualifying. They had a +25 goal differential and finished with 23 points in 10 matches. They're a talented team that includes players like Frenkie de Jong and Virgil van Dijk.\n\nLooking to wager on sports? Head to The Game Day for the latest sports betting odds.\n\nSenegal checks all of the boxes in what you look for in a potential surprise team. They dominated throughout CAF qualifying and captured the African Cup. They also have the starpower with Sadio Mané up front.\n\nThis team could cause problems.\n\nLet's take a look at the best bets for Senegal and Netherlands in this World Cup Group A match.\n\nSenegal vs Netherlands Odds\n\n3-way handicap : Senegal (+450) | Draw (+250) | Netherlands (-143)\n\n: Senegal (+450) | Draw (+250) | Netherlands (-143) Draw No Bet : Senegal (+280) | Netherlands (-435)\n\n: Senegal (+280) | Netherlands (-435) Over/Under Goals: Over 2.5 (+100) | Under 2.5 (-141)\n\nSenegal vs Netherlands odds are current as of 10 a.m. ET on Friday, Sept. 16 at BetMGM Sportsbook.\n\nWhile I expected Netherlands to come in as favorites in this match, I think that the odds are a bit inflated here. Senegal have the pieces in place to give the Oranje a real challenge here.\n\nThe Under is juiced up at -141 odds, which doesn't make much sense considering how Netherlands can score goals at such a high rate. There's value on the Over in this spot.\n\nSenegal vs Netherlands Preview\n\nSenegal lines up in a 4-3-3 formation under manager Aliou Cissé, allowing their wingers to make an impact on the flank. Mané is joined by Ismaïla Sarr on the wing, who plays for Watford in the English Premier League. They also have notable names in the midfield, like Idrissa Gueye, on defense, with Kalidou Koulibaly, and in goalkeeper Édouard Mendy.\n\nNetherlands also play in a 4-3-3 with Louis van Gaal at the helm. They're stacked at each level of the pitch. We mentioned De Jong and Van Dijk, but there are others like Memphis Depay, Steven Bergwijn, and many more.\n\nThe Dutch are always a threat to light up the scoresheet, but they've become labeled as that squad that often fails to meet expectations.\n\nSenegal vs Netherlands Betting Tips\n\nThe key here is for Senegal to slow down this high-powered attack from the Oranje. Netherlands have scored a combined 32 goals in their last 10 matches. This includes an impressive 1-4 win over Belgium in the UEFA Nations League.\n\nThe good news for the Lions of Teranga is that they have some capable defenders, like Koulibaly, who has recently moved to Chelsea. He'll have to come in at top form to help Senegal get that desired result in this match.\n\nSenegal vs Netherlands Prediction\n\nSenegal 1-2 Netherlands\n\nWhile I love Senegal as a surprise team, it's tough to predict anything other than a Netherlands win with the form they've shown in recent matches.\n\nNetherlands is looking to bounce back after failing to qualify for the last World Cup. This came after finishing third in the previous one. They have the ability to go deep in the tournament with this roster and current form.\n\nSenegal vs Netherlands Best Bets\n\nWe're projecting that Senegal will hold their own here, but ultimately fall short in a high-scoring match.\n\n➕ Over 2.5 Total Goals (+100) at BetMGM Sportsbook\n\nWAGER: 1 Unit\n\nNetherlands simply has too much firepower to not take the Over at plus-money here. They have averaged 3.2 goals per game in their last 10 matches.\n\nSenegal has talent up front with Mane, so they can grab a goal, as well. We'll ride with the Over.\n\nClick to bet on this Total at BetMGM.

    "SENEGAL: Work to improve rainwater drainage in Touba": "In Senegal, the dilapidated state of certain water facilities (boreholes, pipes, water towers) in the city of Touba, the headquarters of the Muslim brotherhood of the Mourides, is the cause of the shortage of drinking water. At a time when this religious city is in the midst of preparations for the great Magal pilgrimage to be held on 14 and 15 September 2022, the Senegalese government wants to strengthen the sanitation and water supply system.\n\nIt is within this framework that the Senegalese Ministry of Water and Sanitation has recently equipped the holy city with 24 pumping trucks to allow the evacuation of stagnant rainwater during this period of heavy rains. “These trucks will intervene a few days before and after the Magal to clear the water points without enforcement. We had to visit the basin of Keur Kab. Pipes are being laid to ensure pumping to this basin, which has a greater capacity,” said Serigne Mbaye Thiam, Senegal’s Minister of Water and Sanitation.\n\nAt the same time, the National Sanitation Office of Senegal (ONAS) will deploy 50 hydrocureur trucks to empty the pits and install mobile toilets in most of Touba’s neighbourhoods such as Darou Khoudoss, Gouye Mbind, Touba Mosque, Khaira, Guédé Bousso, Samer, Ndame and Madiyana. In addition, four boreholes with a unit flow rate of 120,000 m3 per hour have been commissioned.\n\nAccelerating local development\n\nAccording to the Senegalese authorities, these various installations are intended to integrate Touba into an overall urban planning programme. This will facilitate the supply of drinking water to this city in the Diourbel region, which is home to 30% of Senegal’s population. The initiative of the government of this West African country comes at the end of the “Touba, xepp ndox mu neex”.\n\nThis is an operation launched in March 2022 by the local authorities and which allowed the transfer of water from Lake Guiers (considered the largest freshwater reserve in Senegal with an area of 300 km2, editor’s note) for the supply of water to the people of Touba. This operation also benefited from the support of Cheikh Ahmadou Bamba University. In the long term, it will allow three agricultural campaigns per year and will thus contribute to the fight against youth unemployment in the region.\n\nBenoit-Ivan Wansi",

    "SENEGAL: In Matam, people warned about the Senegal River flooding": "The Senegal River is the second largest river in West Africa after the Niger River, covering more than 1,750 km, and is characterised by its proximity to the Sahara Desert. Faced with an imminent rise in its waters during the rainy season, the river could “soon overflow” in the northern town of Matam, the Senegalese authorities warned.\n\n“The data collected over the last few hours at the Matam hydrometric station indicate that the Senegal River is getting closer and closer to the alert level, which is 8 metres,” says the Senegalese Ministry of Water and Sanitation. In response to the rising waters, the municipality of Matam and Mayor Mamadou Mory Diaw recommend that all residents of the Senegal River prepare for the damage that flooding could cause.\n\nThis hydrological situation is delicate in a locality where agriculture and livestock farming are the main means of subsistence for its 654,000 inhabitants, according to Senegal’s National Agency for Statistics and Demography (ANSD). The neighbouring towns of Tiambe, Tiguere Soubalbe, Tiguere Yene, Diamel and Navel are also affected by the Senegalese government’s flood alert.\n\nDakar under water…\n\nDuring the rainy season, which generally runs from June to October in Senegal, the Dakar region (particularly the commune of Keur Massar, editor’s note) is also submerged by water, despite the construction of drainage channels and pumping stations. In order to find a permanent solution to these perpetual floods, the government of this West African country launched the Ten-Year Flood Management Programme (PDGI) in 2012.\n\nThe initiative has mobilised 511 billion CFA francs (780 million euros) from several financial partners to improve drainage infrastructure in the capital. In August 2021, the Senegalese government released a further 42.3 million euros (27.8 billion CFA francs) for the implementation of the disaster relief plan (ORSEC). This funding has enabled the acquisition of some fifty hydro-cleaners to unblock the drains, as well as 150 motor pumps.\n\nBenoit-Ivan Wansi"
