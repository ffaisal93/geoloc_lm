    "A Look At PauknAir Flight 4101's Crash In Morocco": "The story of how a Spanish BAE 146 crashed in North Africa, killing all passengers and crew.\n\nExactly 24 years ago yesterday, a PauknAir British Aerospace 146 with the registration EC-GEO crashed short of Melilla Airport (MLN) in the Spanish enclave of Melilla on the Moroccan coast. With an area of just 4.7 square miles and a population of 87,000, Melilla is one of two autonomous Spanish cities in Morocco, the other being Ceuta.\n\nThe plane involved in the crash was the seventh BAe 146 ever built, making its first flight in 1983 before being delivered new to British Airways. A year later, the plane went to Dan-Air London. It later went into storage for several years before being acquired by Spanish regional airline PauknAir in 1995.\n\nThe plane departed Malaga for North Africa early in the morning\n\nOn September 25, 1998, the plane took off from what is now Malaga Costa del Sol Airport (AGP) for the short 129-mile hop over the Mediterranean Sea to the Spanish autonomous city of Melilla on the coast of Morocco.\n\nIt takes around 55 minutes to fly from Malaga to Melilla. Image GCmaps\n\nIn charge of the flight was 39-year-old Captain Diego Clavero Muñoz, assisted by 28-year-old First Officer Bartolomé Jiménez.\n\nFlight 4101 departed Malaga at 07:25 local time and climbed to a cruising altitude of 14,000 feet. The co-pilot then contacted Air Traffic Control (ATC) in Seville, asking for clearance to descend to 7,000 feet which was approved. Two minutes later, the now inbound aircraft was cleared to descend a further 2,000 to flight level FL 50 and contact Melilla tower for instructions. During the conversation, the co-pilot informed Melilla Tower that they were 30 nautical miles out, descending to 5,000 feet.\n\nThe BAE 146 that crashed was the 7th of its type built. Photo: Uli Elch via Wikimedia Commons.\n\nMelilla Tower reported that Runway 33 was in use with visibility of five miles and a few clouds at 1,000 feet with five knots of wind. At 06:45 Moroccan time, the co-pilot told Melilla Tower that they were now at 3,000 feet, 22 nautical miles from the runway. As the descent continued, the aircraft crossed the Moroccan coast at an altitude of 1,100 feet.\n\nThe area is impacted by low clouds\n\nBecause of Melilla Airport's location on Cape Tres Forcas, visibility is often a problem as clouds accumulate in the steep valleys formed by the mountains of the cape. As the descent into Melilla continued flying under instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), the pilot complained of fog and could be heard saying, \"I see nothing.\" At 06:49, the GPWS alarm warned the pilots that they were dangerously close to the ground. At about 890 feet, the GPWS alarm sounded again, \"Whoop, whoop, Pull Up, Whoop, whoop, Pull Up.\" At 06:50, the aircraft impacted the ground at 886 feet, killing all 38 passengers and crew.\n\nEl 25-09-1998, hace 23 años hoy, un avión #BAE146 (EC-GEO) de la compañía española #PauknAir, se estrelló contra una montaña 8 millas al Norte del Aeropuerto de #Melilla.

The crash was put down as being a Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT), listing several contributing factors, which were:\n\nThe non-application of arrival procedures, including descending below a safe altitude.\n\nPoor working communication between the captain and first officer.\n\nA non-application of guidelines regarding the ground proximity warning system (GPWS).",
    "Morocco combats the needs by importing more than 5 million tonnes of cereals": "In a context where Ukraine, one of the main wheat producers, is at war, and in a situation of climatic emergency, the Moroccan government has also seen an increase in cereal shortages. For this reason, Morocco has implemented a series of measures to avoid shortages and the impact on the local market. In this sense, the Kingdom has increased the number of grain suppliers.\n\nCountries such as Argentina and France will be new suppliers to the country. Both nations will join the list of more than 25 countries to which the Alawi kingdom opened up in 2021 to guarantee the supply of domestic needs. The state of grain stocks in Europe and Argentina for the 2022/2023 season would be assured, according to projections by the Ministry of Agriculture, Maritime Fisheries, Rural Development and Water and Forestry. In addition, they add that the harvest data for these countries for this new year are encouraging and remain stable.\n\nTo this we must add the cereal produced within the country. According to data from the balance of the previous season, more than 34 million quintals were produced. This includes 18.9 million quintals of soft wheat, 8.1 million quintals of durum wheat and 7 million quintals of barley. The government also granted a premium for imported grain from November 2021.\n\nPHOTO/FILE - Grain\n\nThese volumes of grain can be imported thanks to the large number of global grain shippers with whom the Moroccan government cooperates. According to Intercereales (a group of French cereal exporters), \"imports of common wheat would be 4.5 to 5 million tonnes next year due to the drought. France has already delivered nearly one million quintals of wheat during the summer months, according to Yann Lebeau, head of the group of professionals in the Maghreb region at Intercereales in a press release. By the end of this year, the country is expected to receive a total of 2.5 million quintals of wheat from France. Thanks to this strategy of diversification of cereal sources, Morocco has been shielded from external fluctuations, due to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, which are, respectively, the second and third largest supplier of soft wheat to the Kingdom, the ministry said.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the collaboration of the agencies concerned and the country's government is working to meet the country's five-month consumption needs. Tensions in certain parts of the country complicate the situation. The objective of the measures imposed by the Executive is to mitigate the impact on the purchasing power of citizens due to the rise in prices and the inflation rate. The significant increase in Morocco's import bill is linked to products such as barley and soybean oil. The increase in prices rose compared to the previous year by 47.4%, in the case of barley by as much as 820 %. Foods such as sugar, tea and edible oils, which are considered staples, would be the first to be affected by the measures, according to the Royal High Guidelines. Possible scenarios for stockpiling of staple food stocks, such as those mentioned above, were also set out and an inventory of existing storage facilities for both raw materials and finished products was discussed.\n\nPHOTO/AFP - Terminal I of the port of Tangier Med\n\nIn his speech to Parliament on the occasion of the opening of the first session of the first legislative year, King Mohammed VI called for the implementation of a policy of stockpiling strategic commodities, \"we will first of all stress the necessary consolidation of Morocco's position and the imperative defence of its superior interests, particularly in the current situation which brings with it challenges, risks and threats. Indeed, the pandemic crisis has revealed the strong return of the sovereignty issue. Whether it be health, energy, industrial, food or other, the preservation of sovereignty has become the subject of a real competition, which is causing some people to react feverishly\".",
    "South Sudan rejects Morocco’s request to severe relations with Sahrawi": "September 24, 2022 (JUBA) – South Sudan has rejected Morocco’s request for it to severe diplomatic ties with the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, saying it supports the position of the African Union (AU) and United Nations (UN) on the matter.\n\nThe Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic is a partially recognised state, recognised by 41 UN member states, located in the western Maghreb, which claims the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara, but controls only the easternmost one-fifth of that territory.\n\nOn Tuesday, South Sudan’s Vice President for Services Cluster, Hussein Abdelbagi Akol met and held discussions with the Sahrawi Minister of Foreign Affairs on the sidelines of the 77th regular session of the UN General Assembly in New York.\n\nThe two leaders discussed bilateral relations, how to advance the interests of Africans, advocate for peace, security and supporting more than a decade-old policy in which they supported the continental body’s call for free self-determination of the Sahrawi people.\n\nThe meeting between the two leaders angered the Moroccan government, which protested in a letter it sent to the South Sudanese embassy in the North African country.\n\nHowever, South Sudan’s Foreign Affairs ministry informed the Kingdom of Morocco government that “the meeting between our delegation and the Sahrawi Minister of Foreign Affairs does not negate our strategic bilateral relations with the kingdom.”\n\n“The Republic of South Sudan is a member of the African Union and the United Nations and would want to reiterate that it does not see it fit to have contrary views to the position of the African Union and UN [Security Council] Resolution 690, as a viable engagement framework to find a lasting solution over the dispute on Western Sahara”, it added.\n\nJuba further said it has not deviated from supporting the AU and UN’s position which insists the Sahrawi people be allowed to decide their future.\n\n“South Sudan’s leadership and the government position on the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic is fully supportive of the decision of the Organization of African Unity turned African Union to admit SADR to its membership on 22nd August 1982, and the AU Charter which calls for the unquestionable and inalienable right of a people to self-determination,” stressed the ministry’s statement.\n\nIn 2017, Morocco’s King Mohammed VI visited South Sudan and held talks with President Salva Kiir aimed at “promoting friendship and solidarity” between both nations. The visit came at the time Morroco was seeking support to return to the AU.\n\nForeign policy experts, however, argue that the position of South Sudan would have backpedaled a decade-old policy in which African countries generally support calls for a referendum in a region Morocco claims is part of its territory.\n\n(ST)",
    "Morocco: Free activist Rida Benotmane immediately and drop all charges against him": "Ahead of tomorrow’s hearing by a court in Rabat on the case of human rights defender Rida Benotmane, who is being prosecuted for criticising the authorities on YouTube and Facebook, Amna Guellali, Deputy director for Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International said:\n\n\n\n“The only ‘crime’ Rida Benotmane has committed was to air legitimate grievances against the authorities in a few social media posts and videos. His case is just the latest attempt by the authorities to use absurd prosecutions to silence critical voices and highlights the worrying crackdown in Morocco on freedom of expression.\n\nThe only ‘crime’ Rida Benotmane has committed was to air legitimate grievances against the authorities in a few social media posts and videos Amna Guellali, Amnesty International\n\n\n\n“Rida Benotmane should be freed immediately and these bogus charges against him dropped. The Moroccan authorities must ensure that people are able to exercise their freedom of expression without fear of reprisals.”\n\n\n\nAmnesty International has reviewed court files showing that the National Judicial Police Brigade (BNPJ) in Casablanca interrogated Rida Benotmane over a Facebook post he published on 13 September 2021, which called for a public march against abuses by security forces. Police also questioned him over two YouTube videos published in August 2021, in which he denounced the authorities for ignoring people’s demands for social justice and warned against the potential use of COVID vaccine passes as a tool of repression.\n\nBenotmane was arrested on 9 September and charged the next day with “insulting a body regulated by law”, “insulting public officials while carrying out their duties”, and “broadcasting and distributing false allegations without consent” under articles 265, 263, and 447-2 of the Penal Code respectively. He was also charged with breaching the decree law on the state of health emergency. He will appear before the Rabat first instance court on 22 September.\n\nBenotmane, a member of the Moroccan Association for the defense of human rights (AMDH) and a political activist who has already spent four years in jail, is currently on hunger strike in protest at his detention.\n\nBackground\n\nMoroccan authorities have increasingly targeted dissenting voices in recent months.\n\nIn April 2022, Saida el Alami, a human rights defender and member of the “Femmes Marocaines Contre la Detention Politique” collective, was sentenced to two years in prison for posting about her ill-treatment by the police and for criticizing the repression of journalists and activists. Blogger Rabie al-Ablaq was also sentenced in the same month to four years in prison for offending the king in two videos posted on social media.",

    "Morocco: Iconic women’s rights advocate Aicha Chenna passes away – The North Africa Post": "Aicha Chenna, the iconic women’s rights advocate who was part of the first generation of Moroccan women who raised the banner of the struggle for equality and the promotion of women’s rights in Morocco passed away on Saturday at the age of 81 and was laid to rest on Sunday.\n\nAicha Chenna was born on August 14, 1941 in Casablanca. She left to live in Marrakech before returning to Casablanca in 1953. Fatherless, she studied nursing and then worked as a health and social education moderator in the Ministry of Health. Very early, she had to deal with vulnerable women and issues that were considered as social and religious taboos. She is leaving behind a valuable legacy in matters of women’s rights as she was one of the most prominent defenders of these rights and as she tirelessly struggled and took initiatives that sought to empower women, especially single mothers.\n\nIt was an uphill task. Single mothers are ostracized in Moroccan society and so are their children born out of wedlock. Yet, Aicha Chenna managed to endure all difficulties, and out of sheer determination, she confronted all criticism.\n\nIn 1985, she founded the Association Solidarité féminine (ASF) for the defense of women’s rights and abandoned children. It was the first association in Morocco to offer training and literacy courses to give financial and professional independence to single mothers and victims of rape, often rejected by their families and by society.\n\nShe made of the advocacy for single mothers a life battle to grant these women the rights they did not have, as she fought for the status of illegitimate and abandoned children and of incest victims.\n\nAicha Chenna’s activism, recognized at the national and international level, has been supported by King Mohammed VI. She once said: “The King has shown me his blessing and has given me the key to the success of my mission. His encouragement, his high concern and his magnanimous gestures strengthen my conviction and give me every day the strength and courage to continue.”\n\nShe was awarded for her remarkable work of activism back in 2009, when she won the $1 million Opus Prize, which she said would be used to ensure that her foundation carries on its work even after her death.\n\n“Today, Morocco has lost a symbol of the feminist human rights struggle…Aicha Chenna was the mother of all, and her achievements in the human rights field will remain a source of pride for all Moroccans,” commented university professor and researcher in sociology, Somaya Noaman guessous.\n\nAicha Chenna, or the Mother-Courage, who made great sacrifices at the expense of her time and personal life for the sake of single mothers, in order to preserve their dignity, render justice for children born out of wedlock, and to reverberate the voice of vulnerable groups, especially women, will always be remembered as an icon of feminism and activism in Morocco and beyond.",
    "How Ruto fertiliser plan forces him to appease Morocco": "By Tony Mochama More by this Author\n\nOn his first full day in office, President William Ruto said that Kenya’s relations with the Kingdom of Morocco would be “speeded up in areas of trade, agriculture, health, tourism, energy, among others, for the mutual benefit of our countries.”\n\nA day earlier, in his inauguration speech, the President had made a public pledge to lower fertiliser prices from the current Sh6,500 to Sh3,500 per 50-kilogram bag.\n\nA Wednesday trade meeting with Nasser Bourita, the Foreign Minister of the Kingdom of Morocco, led to President Ruto seeking a new mutually beneficial trade relationship with the North African economic giant.\n\nThe Maroc is the biggest producer of fertiliser on the continent.\n\nAlso Read: Day one goof? Confusion as President Ruto wades into Morocco-Sahrawi stalemate\n\nOn the small matter of the Sahrawi diplomatic gaffe, Kenya has taken the position that the United Nations framework is the exclusive mechanism for dispute resolution over any territorial issues, such as those that Morocco faces in its southern Saharawi province.\n\nRelated Sahrawi gaffe hands Ruto first diplomatic dilemma\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is no secret that the first 1.4 million bags of fertiliser will come from Morocco, with the new regime seeking to make longer-term arrangements in that area hoping to see fertiliser prices remain low or stable.\n\n“High prices of fertiliser are one of the main reasons the cost of food has become unaffordable”, Dr Ruto said repeatedly during his campaign for the presidency, “and we will lower it when elected.”\n\nMoroccan company OCP (Office Chérifien des Phosphates) is the world’s leading manufacturer of phosphate-based fertilisers, with a third of the world market and over $6 billion in revenue in 2021.\n\n“Long term, to use a practical example, if the new President wishes to establish lower fertiliser prices for farmers without subsidies and other unsustainable mid- to long-term measures as were being previously done with oil under the previous regime, he may wish to get Kenya into intra-trade with a company like OCP, which means the foreign policies of both countries have to be aligned in a friendly axis for the mutual benefit of Kenya and Maroc,” a Counsellor Delegate to the United Nations Office, who is privy to these trade discussions, told the Sunday Nation.\n\nThere is no practical benefit for Kenya in engaging on Saharawi issues outside of the UN framework, he says.\n\nLast week at a thanksgiving service in Maua, Meru County, the then president-elect Ruto promised that he would announce new fertiliser prices within the week, a promise he swiftly fulfilled on assuming power.\n\n“I have spoken to representatives from the Ministry of Agriculture to announce new fertiliser prices,” President Ruto said. “We start the journey of reforming the agricultural sector next week (this week), so that we can change the cost of living in Kenya.”\n\nBehind the scenes, talks on fertiliser trade, cost, import and investment are ongoing between the two nations.\n\nCartels\n\nPresident Ruto appears eager to hit the ground running on matters of agriculture, and has also promised to deal with the cartels that control the movement of miraa (khat) in Meru. He also vowed to do away with “burdensome” coffer-draining food and fuel subsidies.\n\nIn 2017, after the Republic of Nigeria and the Kingdom of Morocco entered a long-term trade deal on fertiliser trade, the price per bag went down from the equivalent of Sh5,000 to Sh1,700 per bag.\n\n“Kenya is strategically placing itself, especially in this regime, for business across Africa,” says Dr Hawa Z Noor, a peace and security analyst for the Horn of Africa. “It’s the way to go.”\n\nAbout 20 African heads of state attended President Ruto’s inauguration in Kasarani on Tuesday.\n\nMorocco, over the past 20 years, has become the number one direct African investor in West Africa, contributing 4 per cent of Cameroon’s GDP, and a whopping 9 per cent of the GDP of its neighbour, Senegal.\n\nThrough its “South-South” policy, the Kingdom is now strategically looking at Kenya as an excellent “nation of mutual trade cooperation, especially in areas of agriculture, health and tourism”.\n\nIn the next few years, the tea-drinking kingdom would like to “gobble up Kenyan tea” as per a diplomatic representative.\n\nMorocco is the eighth-largest importer of tea in the world at $200 million, while Kenya is the third-largest exporter at $1.2 billion, which means a sixth of Kenyan tea could go to Morocco alone.\n\nAfrican-markets.com, a digital tracking platform, ranked eight Moroccan companies among the most valuable among the 20 firms surveyed in the 52-country African continent.\n\nIn the not-too-distant horizon, there are also plans to co-operate on the tourism front with the Kingdom.\n\nWhile the Maroc, with its mountain-and-sea diversified vistas, got over 13 million visitors pre-covid-19, Kenya got just over two million despite its coast-and-safari scenery.\n\nThere are plans to revisit Kenya’s marketing, using the Maroc example.\n\nMombasa is already the sister city of Tangiers in a deal penned in June 2021 by the then governor, Hassan Joho. Kisumu Governor Anyang Nyong signed a bilateral cooperation MOU with Rabat president Rachid El Abdi in March 2022.\n\nIn 2016, The International Finance Corporation, IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, and Attijariwafa Bank (AWB), a renowned Pan-African banking group, signed an agreement to support businesses and boost investment and cross-border trade in Africa. Attijariwafa is the fourth most-valuable company on the continent.\n\n[email protected]",

But according to the Spanish daily El Economista, Abengoa intends to sell its shares in the Agadir seawater desalination plant that it built. This information comes barely four months after the end of the contractual tests on the new plant. This decision would be justified by the financial difficulties that Abengoa has been facing since 2016. This led to the company being placed in receivership in February 2020, according to the Spanish newspaper.\n\nA 30-year PPP at stake\n\nSeveral groups and investment funds have already shown their interest in the Spanish giant Abengoa. This is the case of its colleague Acciona or the French group Engie which is implementing a desalination project in the Casablanca-Settat region. When contacted by AFRIK 21, Abengoa officials did not confirm this share sale project. But they do not deny the existence of a transaction in progress for Abengoa’s factory in Agadir, Morocco.\n\nIn addition to the construction of the desalination plant, Abengoa was to operate the Agadir desalination plant over a period of 30 years under the terms of a public-private partnership (PPP) signed with the National Office of Electricity and Drinking Water (Onee) and the Moroccan Ministry of Agriculture, Maritime Fishing, Rural Development and Water and Forests.\n\nAbengoa financed the desalination project for 41 billion Moroccan dirhams (nearly €3.9 billion) with its local partner InfraMaroc, an investment fund launched by CDG Capital and backed by Morocco’s Caisse de dépôt et de gestion (CDG). The new facility is capable of supplying 275,000 m3 of water per day, divided between the needs of the population of Greater Agadir (150,000 m3 per day) and the irrigation (125,000 m3 per day) of agricultural land. These plantations are located in the Chtouka plain, a large market gardening area. This capacity is expandable to 400,000 m3 per day.

    "British growers consider moving production to Morocco": "British producers of fruits and vegetables are considering shifting their operations to warmer countries, including Morocco. Chief Executive of the British Growers Association Jack Ward suspects that the European production of fruit and vegetables will move south: \"We will move production further and further south, down through Spain and into Morocco and bits of Africa.\"\n\nThe ongoing surge in energy prices has prompted farmers in northern and western Europe to suspend or cut their activities. Ward argues that the rising production costs are set to impact the growth of crops such as tomatoes, peppers, and cucumbers that require heated greenhouses during winter. The production of apples, onions, and endives which necessitate cold storage of crops, will also be impacted. Excessive energy bills and fertilizer prices have heavily impacted growers in France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Spain.\n\nAs European agricultural producers turn to Morocco to increase their profit margin amid a serious economic crisis, some French and Spanish farmers continue to protest the importation of Moroccan fruits and vegetables, questioning the quality of the goods.\n\nSource: moroccoworldnews.com",

    "Morocco remains firm in its commitment to curb illegal immigration to Europe": "Morocco has managed to frustrate more than 40,000 irregular migration attempts to Europe so far this year, a situation that reaffirms the Kingdom's commitment to managing migration. To this end, the Moroccan authorities made more than 7,000 arrests of immigrants trying to cross the border into European territory.\n\nFor Khalid Zerouali, Director of Immigration and Border Surveillance at the Moroccan Institute for Strategic Studies (IRES), this action is a declaration of intent on the part of the Kingdom with respect to its fight against this type of migration, pointing out that these figures \"show conclusive results\" on which to base this commitment.\n\nREUTERS/JON NAZCA - Migrants run towards the fence separating Morocco from Spain\n\nAlthough he added that \"the fact that there is a decrease in arrivals on the Spanish coast does not mean that the pressure here in Morocco has decreased\".\n\nIt was he himself who provided these figures in a recent interview with Agencia EFE. In addition, Zerouali stated that attempts to enter Europe irregularly via Morocco increased by 11% at the end of July compared to the same period last year.\n\nMoroccan authorities also dismantled 124 smuggling networks operating at the Kingdom's border so far this year, a figure that once again demonstrates Morocco's commitment to ending the scourge of this type of criminal activity in the country.\n\nAP/BERNAT ARMANGUE - Image of migrants near the border between Spain and Morocco\n\nBut the Kingdom's law enforcement agencies not only combat irregular migration through ground-level operations, but Morocco is also active at the regional and international level, providing advice and expertise in the fight against irregular migration.\n\n\"Morocco is a state that lives up to its duties, it has always shown its willingness at all regional and international levels to share its experience with friendly countries,\" said the IRES director.\n\nAFP/FADEL SENNA - Archive photo in the Spanish enclave of Ceuta\n\nHe also wanted to make it clear that Morocco \"does not exploit anything for political reasons\", so accusing the Kingdom of doing so \"is unfounded\".\n\nEurope also takes responsibility and is aware of the work that Morocco is carrying out, which is why last month the EU pledged 500 million euros in aid to contribute to the North African country's migration management efforts.",

And Guatemala agrees with this line, something that became clear after the meeting held on Thursday between Nasser Bourita, Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs, African Cooperation and Moroccans Resident Abroad, and his Guatemalan counterpart, Mario Búcaro Flores, on the sidelines of the 77th General Assembly of the United Nations.\n\n\"Guatemala has reiterated its clear position on the regional dispute over the Moroccan Sahara, considering that autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty is the solution to this discrepancy and announces the decision to open a consulate in the city of Dakhla to take advantage of its economic potential and its openness to the rest of the African continent,\" according to a joint official statement issued after the meeting between the Foreign Ministers of the two countries.\n\n\"The concepts of sovereignty, peace and territorial integrity are very important to us. We support Morocco's position on this issue and we will continue to support Morocco forever\", the head of diplomacy of the Central American country said in statements made to the press and echoed by media such as Atlas Info.\n\nMario Búcaro Flores highlighted \"the reforms undertaken by Morocco under the leadership of His Majesty King Mohammed VI and its important role in the resolution of various problems in Africa and the Arab world\" with a view to pacifying the Maghreb region and the Middle East.\n\nPHOTO/TWITTER/MAROC DIPLOMATIE/@MarocDiplomatie - Mario Búcaro Flores and Nasser Bourita\n\nFor his part, Nasser Bourita highlighted \"the efforts of the Government of Guatemala led by His Excellency the President of the Republic, Alejandro Giammattei, aimed at carrying out reforms in the country and strengthening its role at regional and international level to promote peace\".\n\nMorocco and Guatemala showed great harmony on various international issues and announced the intention to 'boost bilateral cooperation in the areas of tourism, training and energy, with special emphasis on agriculture and fertilisers (where Morocco plays an important role), at a time when the world is facing a major food crisis', as reported by Atlas Info.\n\nThis step is also a major boost for Dakhla, which is receiving significant support for its development. This has been demonstrated by the boost in investment that the area is receiving, for example with the holding of the Dakhla International Investors' Forum on 18 and 19 September.\n\nGuatemala thus joins the list of countries that have decided to open consulates in the southern provinces of the Kingdom of Morocco, making it the 29th country to carry out this operation.

This great diplomatic support had its key moment when Donald Trump's US administration recognised the Moroccan sovereignty of the Sahara in December 2020, something reaffirmed by Joe Biden's government, in exchange for Morocco establishing diplomatic ties with Israel following the dynamic of the famous Abraham Accords sealed in September 2020, by which various Arab countries such as the Emirates and Bahrain established political relations with the Israeli state under US mediation with a view to pacifying the Middle East and promoting the region's economic and social development. Subsequently, other nations such as Germany and Spain followed suit and recognised the Moroccan initiative as the most \"realistic, serious and credible\" way to solve the Western Sahara problem.\n\nOpposing this trend is the opposing position of the Polisario Front, which advocates holding a referendum on independence for the Saharawis, a proposal that has less significant international support, including that of Algeria, Morocco's great political rival in the Maghreb, which has even broken off diplomatic relations with the Alawi kingdom due to the political differences between the two countries, including the resolution of the Western Sahara conflict.\n\nAmericas Coordinator: José Antonio Sierra",

The deal was signed by Israeli Defence Minister Benny Gantz and Morocco's Minister in charge of National Defence Administration, Abdellatif Loudiyi, last November.\n\nThe Israel Defence website reported from local security sources that the technology in question is linked to the secret Elenit intelligence system for electronic warfare, which is manufactured by Elbit Systems. It is used to collect radar signals from air defence systems. Elbit confirmed the delivery of ground units equipped with electronic support, countermeasures and command and control systems.\n\nAccording to the same sources, these units will allow the Moroccan armed forces to respond effectively to air and ground threats. The technology can be used with drones already deployed by Morocco such as the Israeli-made Harop and Turkiye's Bayraktar TB2. Israeli reports say that the deal is worth up to $70 million for a thirty-month contract.\n\nThe announcement coincides with details of another air defence deal between Morocco and Israel.

    "Morocco Chairs the Ministerial Meeting of Atlantic African States in New York": "The Minister of Foreign Affairs, African Cooperation and Moroccan Expatriates, Mr. Nasser Bourita, reaffirmed, on September 23rd, 2022 in New York, Morocco’s commitment to an African Atlantic partnership that will be actively serving stability and co-development.\n\nSpeaking at the ministerial meeting of African Atlantic States, Mr. Bourita stressed that the reactivation of this geostrategic alliance expresses the vision and commitment of His Majesty King Mohammed VI, to make the African Atlantic space a framework for pragmatic and timely interstate cooperation.\n\n“Our meeting last June and the Rabat Declaration that came out of it, have materialized this vision, establishing the Atlantic area of Africa as a space of peace, stability and shared prosperity,” he noted. In this regard, he stressed that through the Rabat Declaration, the Atlantic African States have demonstrated the strong ambition to place joint action in the framework of a broader partnership and deepen the links of integration, in order to confront more effectively the challenges of the region and to identify the great potential for cooperation\n\nMr. Bourita further noted that these states have agreed that joint actions are guided by the principles of consultation, solidarity and a dynamic and enterprising South-South cooperation, noting that the international context, which has rarely been as complex as today, reinforces the relevance of this initiative.\n\n“It also commits us to respond to the imperative of consolidating our partnership. Especially since we are facing the same challenges and we share the same concerns, including security, stability and sustainable development, “he explained.\n\nHighlighting the complex, interconnected and multidimensional threats facing the region, the Minister warned of terrorist threats that are spreading in several parts of Africa with “very negative” repercussions on the stability of the region.\n\n“An effective fight against terrorism requires an integrated approach aimed at actions both in terms of security, promoting the ideals of tolerance and achieving sustainable development,” he said, adding that the situation regarding transnational organized crime in the region is also very worrying. “Illicit trafficking in arms, drugs or human beings are developing very quickly and threaten peace and development in the Atlantic African space,” he warned.\n\nMr. Bourita also warned against the threats posed by piracy, which “harm the prospects of economic development and trade of countries in the region,” saying that the direct and indirect cost of piracy in the Gulf of Guinea would approach two billion dollars annually and this figure does not include all the costs borne by African countries and their partners.\n\nThe Minister also noted that the intertwining of terrorism, separatism and transnational organized crime, multiplies the threat by creating an “alliance of evil forces”. “No country can meet, alone, these challenges,” he stressed, calling for pooling efforts, through cooperation and coordination, is necessary.\n\nReferring to the prospects for cooperation, Bourita highlighted the immense opportunities for partnerships in the region in the areas of blue economy, maritime cooperation, as well as energy.\n\n“The blue economy is projected to bring $ 3,000 billion in value added annually to the global economy by 2030, and our region has a huge potential in this area,” he noted, indicating that maritime cooperation is also an asset, “which would allow us to strengthen our economic integration and trade and improve our competitiveness in the global economy.\n\nRegarding the environmental challenges facing the region, Bourita said that efforts to address these challenges are part of the dynamics of economic cooperation in this area, recalling that the African continent, which contributes to 7% of greenhouse gas emissions, is the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change.\n\n“The initiatives of the African Action Summit, held on the sidelines of COP22 in Marrakech in 2016, on the emergence of Africa through climate action, are among the appropriate actions for our collective fight against climate change,” he argued, adding that the search and promotion of international partnerships is desirable to support efforts and build capacity to meet the challenges and take advantage of cooperation opportunities.\n\nIn this context, he said that a draft Program of Action of this Initiative aims to identify common strategic priorities for the realization of the vision of an effective and inclusive Atlantic African partnership, noting that this project is a unifying element to “unite us around common goals, and guide us in our collective actions.\n\nThe Agenda for Action also serves as a basis for the preparation of the action plans of the three thematic groups created by the Rabat Declaration, dealing with political dialogue and security issues; the blue economy, maritime connectivity and energy as well as sustainable development and the environment, continued the Minister.\n\nHe added that today’s meeting will be sanctioned by a declaration, reaffirming the common will to “consolidate our partnership and to give impetus and guidance to our future collective actions, including the Program of Action and the work of the three Thematic Groups.\n\nThe Minister strongly encouraged the Member States of this partnership to designate the Focal Points of this Draft Program of Action, to start forging the common agenda and harmonizing actions.\n\nThis meeting was held on the sidelines of the 77th United Nations General Assembly.\n\nDistributed by APO Group on behalf of Kingdom of Morocco – Ministry of Foreign Affairs, African Cooperation and Moroccan Expatriates.",
    "Is Tunisia Abandoning Morocco for Algeria?": "For decades, Tunisia has looked on, maintaining its neutral stance as both sides jockeyed for dominance. However, by appearing to have unilaterally invited Brahim Ghali, the Polisario leader and president of the self-declared Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, to a conference it was holding in tandem with Japan, that neutrality has come into question. Moreover, for many observers, the invitation confirmed what many suspected: that Tunisia is growing increasingly close to Algeria, potentially at the expense of its historically close ties with Morocco, while Rabat’s relations with Japan, which Tunis enjoys a burgeoning relationship with, are cast into doubt.\n\nThe Polisario Front, with Algerian support, has been fighting to secure independence for the disputed territory of the Western Sahara since 1973, a move fiercely contested by Morocco since it claimed the territory in dramatic fashion two years later, when some 350,000 flag-carrying Moroccans crossed the desert in Rabat’s “Green March” and essentially forced Spain to hand it over. Fleeing the Moroccan advance, the local population, the Sahrawis, headed for Algeria, eventually settling in a cluster of refugee camps near Tindouf, where they have remained since.\n\nPower balances in North Africa are shifting.

Moreover, for many observers, the invitation confirmed what many suspected: that Tunisia is growing increasingly close to Algeria, potentially at the expense of its historically close ties with Morocco, while Rabat’s relations with Japan, which Tunis enjoys a burgeoning relationship with, are cast into doubt.\n\nThe details of the invitation are opaque at best. The conference, the eighth Tokyo International Conference on African Development, was staged in Tunisia, where Ghali flew in to be met, as with other leaders, off the plane by Tunisian President Kais Saied.\n\nAlthough Morocco’s sensitivity on the subject of the Western Sahara may seem surprising, the fate of the territory has become a central pillar of the kingdom’s worldview.\n\nHis presence appeared to take many by surprise, not least Morocco, which swiftly issued furious missives of the “hurt” caused to the Moroccan people by Tunis’s action. Ambassadors were withdrawn by both countries while Morocco’s newspapers denounced Tunisia’s shortcomings.\n\nSaied and his foreign ministry claimed surprise at the reaction, citing a circular from the African Union, which extended the invitation to all leaders, including Ghali. A statement was issued by the foreign ministry, reaffirming the country’s total neutrality in line with international law, stating, “This position will not change until the concerned parties find a peaceful solution acceptable to all.”\n\nSaied’s ultimate goal remains a matter for speculation. However, with Algeria proving a key energy supplier during Tunisia’s seemingly endless economic crisis while lending vocal support to the president’s legitimacy, Algiers’ rising clout was likely prominent in Saied’s thoughts.\n\nAlthough Morocco’s sensitivity on the subject of the Western Sahara may seem surprising, the fate of the territory has become a central pillar of the kingdom’s worldview. Criticism of Rabat’s deal over the territory with the former Trump administration as well as allowing access to the country’s medical facilities have led to diplomatic breakdowns with Germany and Spain, with the latter also getting dragged into a spying scandal.\n\nSpeaking just before the conference, Morocco’s King Mohammed VI used a televised address to send what he said was a clear message to the world, telling viewers, “The Sahara issue is the prism through which Morocco views its international environment.”\n\nAs recently as December 2020, Morocco’s position appeared assured. Washington had agreed to formally recognize Rabat’s claim to the Western Sahara in return for a corresponding nod to Israel. Spain and Germany, both former critics of the kingdom’s relations with the Sahrawis, had reconciled with the kingdom, supporting Rabat’s plan to establish some form of semi-autonomous government within the region, a move resisted by the Sahrawi people, who insisted on a referendum to determine the area’s fate.\n\nHowever, with European gas prices soaring, Algeria—Europe’s third-largest gas supplier (after Russia and Norway) and the Polisario Front’s chief backer—is also enjoying a diplomatic renaissance. European politicians and regional power brokers are all enjoying a renewed interest in Algiers, with Tunisia’s Saied among them. His July visit secured the reopening of land borders, closed two years earlier to contain the spread of COVID-19, allowing Algerian families to travel into Tunisia and support Tunisia’s ill-fated tourism industry. Tunis also relies on Algeria for its own gas, buying it at a discounted price, as well as receiving revenue for the transport of Algerian gas across its territory, bound for Sicily and then the rest of Europe.\n\n“The war in Ukraine and its impacts on Europe in terms of gas supplies reposition Algeria as an important player in the western Mediterranean,” Raouf Farrah, a senior analyst with Global Initiative told Foreign Policy. “Rabat is more worried about this than its ability to obtain gas supplies at competitive prices following the closure of the [Gazoduc Maghreb Europe] pipeline, which used to supply Spain via Morocco.”\n\nThe plight of the Sahrawis is one of the world’s longest-standing refugee crises. Since 1975, thousands of Sahrawis have been sheltering in the Algerian desert, waiting for the opportunity to return home. The violent campaign fought by Polisario against Rabat was brought to an approximate end in 1991 with a United Nations-brokered cease-fire, providing for a fractious peace. However, even that appears uncertain, with clashes between the Polisario Front and Morocco increasing over the last two years.\n\nWith Algiers proving a key energy supplier during Tunisia’s economic crisis while lending vocal support to the president’s legitimacy, Algeria’s rising clout was likely prominent in Saied’s thoughtsMeanwhile, the U.N. estimates that around 90,000 “vulnerable refugees” are sheltering in the desert, relying on international aid just for their daily food and shelter. Relocating the refugees has proven a fraught problem for all concerned, with political and economic problems all serving as a break on progress.\n\nAlthough some infrastructure exists, with the refugees operating a state in exile, Bahia Awah, a Sahrawi writer and poet, told Foreign Policy—from what he described as his exile in Spain—that life remained difficult. “Weather conditions are especially adverse in this part of southern Algeria, where temperatures in summer can reach up to more than of 50 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit), which causes casualties among the elderly, children, and pregnant women.”\n\nWhile Algeria’s clout may have been boosted for now, how much difference that will make to a dispute the U.S. government weighed in on in dramatic fashion at the end of the Trump administration remains unclear. For Jonathan Hill, a historian from King’s College London, the fate of the Western Sahara and the Sahrawis has, over the decades, morphed from a pragmatic problem to an unswerving policy position and, as such, risks becoming intractable.\n\n“The problem really is one of leadership,” he said. “In 1976, at the time of the Green March, there was a practical problem that everyone recognized needed a solution. However, with both Algeria and Morocco having relatively static leaderships, where there is little change in personnel, the dispute was allowed to rumble on to the point where the Sahrawis fate really has become a matter of faith.”\n\nHow long Tunisia’s pivot may endure is uncertain. However, the fact that Tunis made that pivot at all speaks directly to the new order now taking shape within the region—whether the Sahrawis benefit from that or not.",

    "Morocco commits to two-state solution for Palestinian-Israeli conflict": "Moroccan Foreign Affairs Minister Nasser Bourita met Monday with his Jordanian counterpart Ayman al-Safadi in Amman.\n\nBourita said that Morocco supports the two-state solution to end the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, by establishing an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital on the June 1967 borders.\n\n\"Morocco supports Jordan's pivotal role in the Palestinian cause, and the role of His Majesty King Abdullah II bin Al Hussein with regard to the Islamic Awqaf (charitable assests) in the city of Jerusalem,\" he said.\n\nJordan administers the Al-Aqsa Mosque, built on a contested hilltop compound that is a frequent flashpoint in the ancient city holy to the three monotheistic faiths.\n\nIn a joint statement, Bourita said that Morocco is working with Jordan to support Jerusalemites and to preserve \"the Arab and Islamic identity of Jerusalem.\"\n\nAl-Safadi expressed Jordan's support for Morocco's territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Morocco and the necessity of resolving the issue of the Moroccan Sahara \"in accordance with United Nations resolutions and on the basis of the autonomy initiative.\"\n\nThe area has seen conflict for many years.\n\nBourita and Al-Safadi also discussed bilateral relations and ways to ease issuing visas between the two Kingdoms to facilitate businesses, especially for the private sector.",
    "Morocco and the United States intensify security cooperation": "Morocco and the United States are strengthening cooperation in security matters, continuing the trend of recent years of closer ties between the North African country and the United States.\n\nThe new step taken by both nations came with the meeting held on Monday in Rabat between Abdellatif Hammouchi, Director General of Homeland Security and Land Surveillance of Morocco (DGSN), and Avril Haine, Director of National Intelligence of the United States, in which security and the fight against terrorism were the central issues discussed between two allied and partner countries with a view to improving and progressing in these areas.\n\nThe high-level meeting held in the Rabat capital addressed regional security issues, such as fundamentalist terrorist threats and the activity of groups linked to organised crime, as indicated in an official communiqué distributed by the DGSN. Abdellatif Hammouchi and Avril Haines discussed ways to improve security cooperation at \"the level of the current strategic cooperation between the two countries\", the statement said, noting that the two countries will work harder to bring about greater \"regional and international stability and security\".\n\nPHOTO/FILE – Abdellatif Hammouchi\n\nThe meeting focused on the major threat posed by links between terrorist groups and criminal organisations, including the issue of cybercrime, as well as other forms of cross-border criminality.\n\nCybersecurity was therefore another issue that came to the fore as cybercrime is a major concern in today's age of new technologies. Indeed, the Moroccan authorities pay a lot of attention to this aspect and the General Directorate of Information Systems Security (DGSSI) neutralised more than 500 cyber attacks in 2021, as Morocco World News recalled.\n\nHammouchi and Haines discussed ways to improve bilateral cooperation between Moroccan and US security and intelligence services and the challenges to be faced to preserve security, the statement said.\n\n🇲🇦🤝🇺🇸 Les #USA considèrent le #Maroc comme un allié stratégique en matière de sécurité.

The Alawite kingdom is seen as a relevant actor, and this has led the US giant to seek closer cooperation with Morocco in the security and intelligence fields, and even in the military sphere, something that has been exemplified in recent years by the African Lion military exercises in which both the Alawite kingdom and the US have taken part, along with other African nations.\n\nPHOTO/FILE - African Lion Exercises\n\nAbdellatif Hammouchi himself travelled to Washington in mid-June to meet with US intelligence and security officials in working sessions to discuss the current challenges to regional security in Africa, the Middle East and the world at large, with the worrying presence of jihadist terrorist groups and criminal networks operating in critical places such as North Africa, the Sahara and the Sahel. Morocco's Director General of Homeland Security and Land Surveillance also spent two days in the United States earlier this year to meet with Avril Haines herself, as well as with CIA Director William Burns and FBI Director Christopher Wray to discuss emerging security threats.\n\nPHOTO/AFP - The flags of the United States and Morocco next to a map of Morocco authorised by the US State Department\n\nThe great cooperation between the United States and Morocco, which has been strengthened since the decision of Donald Trump's administration in December 2020 to recognise Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara, which was ratified by Joe Biden's current administration, is thus continuing, in exchange for the Kingdom establishing diplomatic relations with Israel in the wake of the Abraham Accords sealed in September 2020, under which several Arab countries such as the Emirates and Bahrain established political ties with the Israeli state with the aim of pacifying and stabilising the Middle East and developing the region socially and economically.\n\nCoordinator for the Americas: José Antonio Sierra.",

    "Morocco: a key country for Japan in Africa": "Japan is the third largest economy in the world in terms of Gross Domestic Product and considers Morocco a strategic ally as a reference country on the African continent due to its current political position and economic development.\n\nThis is demonstrated by the fact that the North African country is the second largest destination for Japanese investments in Africa through the activity of 75 companies that employ up to 50,000 people in Morocco, a scenario that places the Alawi kingdom in a great position to attract more investments from the Asian country.\n\nThis close relationship between the two partners became clear after the last telematic contact between Nasser Bourita, Morocco's Minister of Foreign Affairs, and his Japanese counterpart Yoshimasa Hayashi, in which the latter indicated that more Japanese companies are interested in Morocco to subcontract their own production in various sectors.\n\nOne of Morocco's great attractions lies in its logistical capacity, with examples such as the port of Tangier Med, a major international benchmark in commercial traffic, and in its industry, especially in the automotive and components sectors, which is highly attractive to a country such as Japan, which has companies such as Sumimoto, Fujikura Automotive and Yazaki, which employ 30,000 people in the Moroccan market.\n\nPHOTO/TANGER MED - General view of the port of Tangier Med 2\n\nJapan also values Morocco as a way of gaining a stronger foothold in the African banking sector. The Japanese bank Mizhu Bank signed an agreement with Attijariwafa Bank, while the Moroccan bank BCP signed a pact with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation to work together in the African market. Moreover, in the field of agriculture, Morocco enjoys a trade surplus with Japan, which relies on Moroccan supplies for 20 per cent of its fertiliser imports, as reported by The North Africa Post.\n\nIn the conversation between the two countries' foreign ministers, Yoshimasa Hayashi described Morocco as a \"key partner\" and was quite in tune with his Moroccan counterpart.\n\nThis despite the fact that Rabat did not participate in the TICAD Japan-Africa Cooperation Forum in Tunis in protest at the reception given by Tunisian President Kais Saied to Brahim Ghali, leader of the Polisario Front, Morocco's great rival over the important issue of Western Sahara.\n\nPHOTO/AP - Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Nasser Bourita\n\nMorocco decided to recall its ambassador to Tunisia following this \"hostile and damaging\" act, and the Tunisian government subsequently decided to reciprocate with the same political move. Tunisia expressed its surprise at this problem and justified this invitation to Brahim Ghali as something that had already been done on other occasions, as reported by the Europa Press agency. But the Kingdom pointed out in an official statement that the \"attempt to justify the hostile act\" contains \"many approximations and falsehoods\". The Moroccan communiqué indicated that only countries that had received an invitation signed by the Japanese prime minister and the Tunisian president could participate in TICAD. \"It is in this framework that 50 invitations were sent to African countries that have diplomatic relations with Japan. Therefore, Tunisia did not have the right to establish a unilateral invitation process,\" Morocco noted in the official note.\n\nAlthough Rabat did not participate in the TICAD conference held on Tunisian soil, the relationship between Morocco and Japan remains excellent. In this regard, the Japanese foreign minister affirmed that his country's position of not recognising the Sahara as a separate country from Morocco \"has not changed\". Thus, Japan continues to show its respect for the territorial integrity of the Alawi kingdom.\n\nThe Japanese Minister underlined that Japan had not invited the Polisario Front to this summit and expressed his country's desire to continue to work with the Kingdom in the framework of TICAD.\n\nPHOTO/PIXABAY - Flag of Japan\n\nFor his part, Nasser Bourita stressed Japan's commitment to promoting a partnership forum with Africa to promote the development of the African continent, stability and the well-being of its peoples, recalling the need to strengthen the TICAD summit as a forum for partnership and development and praising \"the firmness of the position shown by the Japanese delegation in Tunis\".\n\nSeveral experts see in Japan's position a more or less clear support for Morocco's proposal to solve the Western Sahara issue. Nofal Bouamri, a political analyst, explained to Al-Arab that \"if there is a positive side to the current crisis between Tunisia and Morocco due to Tunisian President Kais Saied's reception of the Polisario Front leader, it is that Japan has reaffirmed its support for the autonomy and Moroccan character of the Sahara and considers the Kingdom a basic ally for penetrating Africa\". Thus, Japan's assertion of Moroccan territorial integrity remains fixed and immovable.\n\nIn this context, Mohamed Lakreni, Professor of International Relations and International Law, confirmed that the latest contact between the Moroccan and Japanese foreign ministers endorses the economic collaboration and political harmony between the two countries, as reported by Al-Arab.\n\nThis is in line with Morocco's good diplomatic work. The Alawi kingdom has gained considerable international support for the Western Sahara issue, which is very important to the North African country. The Kingdom proposes a formula of broad autonomy for Western Sahara under Moroccan sovereignty, taking into account the UN resolutions, and this proposal has received the support of important countries, especially after Donald Trump's US administration in December 2020 recognised the Moroccan sovereignty of the Sahara in exchange for Morocco establishing diplomatic relations with Israel, following the famous Abraham Accords, signed in September 2020, under which Arab countries such as the Emirates and Bahrain established political ties with the Israeli state with the aim of socially and economically developing the Middle East and pacifying the region in the face of hostile common enemies such as the Islamic Republic of Iran. Other nations such as Germany and Spain followed suit and favoured Morocco's proposal as the most serious and credible for the Saharan territory.\n\nAFP/FADEL SENNA - The Guerguerat Pass around Western Sahara\n\nOpposing this trend is the position of the Polisario Front, which calls for a referendum on independence for the Sahrawi population. This option has less support at the international level, including Algeria, Morocco's great political rival in the Maghreb, which broke off relations with the Alawi kingdom last August due to serious political differences, despite the outstretched hand that Morocco has extended to its Algerian neighbour on several occasions, such as the last one made by King Mohammed VI in his speech on the Feast of the Throne in 2022.",
    "A youth between Morocco and Spain": "Young Moroccans talk to us about how they carry their sense of dual identity and their relationship with Morocco\n\nCarrying a piece of Morocco with them is one of the major defining features of the Moroccan diaspora living in the European Union. A diaspora that, as well as within Morocco, has youth as its protagonist, not only in the present but also in its future.\n\n\n\nThe recent survey commissioned by the Council of the Moroccan Community Abroad (CCME) from the polling institute IPSOS, published in mid-September, once again focused the media spotlight on 18-35 year-olds. A group known in Morocco as the 'invisible electoral force'. Generally uninterested in Moroccan democratic processes, imprisoned in a sense of dual identity, which some cope with better than others, but also optimistic and hopeful of a future in Europe with opportunities they believe are out of reach in Morocco.\n\nAFP/FADEL SENNA - Moroccan youths walking in a street in the capital Rabat on September 12, 2018\n\nIf Morocco's own youth is a challenge for Aziz Akhannouch's current government, as is often raised in the Maghreb country, it is rarely seen in the same light in Spain. \"Once you finish your studies in Spain as a non-EU foreigner, it's as if for the institutions the road is over\", sums up Sohaib N., a young Tangier-born 28-year-old resident in Madrid who came here 10 years ago to study journalism in Madrid. \"Coming here for fun or for a while is easy. But to work is not so easy. Nothing is made easier by the administration\", adds the young man, who is trying to maintain his situation in Spain in a regular way, without having the slightest intention for the moment of applying for Spanish nationality.\n\n\n\n\"I've never considered asking for nationality, it's not that important to me. Having residency is enough for me\", explains Sohaib, for whom his identity is not defined by a document or a piece of paper. As he says, his upbringing has made him someone with an ambiguous identity. A childhood in Tangiers, fully immersed in Spanish culture through television, internet, school, did not make him feel like a foreigner when he arrived in Spain. And when he returns to Morocco, he feels as Moroccan as the rest. \"I feel in the middle of the two identities\", says the young journalist, a feeling he shares with 70% of those surveyed in Spain by the CCME study. A feeling that rises to 80% in France and 84% in the Netherlands.\n\n\n\nThis is also the case of Meriem F., from Agadir, who moved to Spain 8 years ago for love and who says she feels more and more like a foreigner in Morocco. It is no longer just a question of how she feels she is perceived by others, but almost a question of comfort in her own country. \"Sometimes it even pisses me off\", explains Meriem, for whom the administration's services are a clear example of what bothers her most in Morocco. She is one of the 71% of the community that feels like a foreigner back in Morocco after a long period in Spain. Meriem wants to apply for Spanish nationality in two years' time. With the nationality, she wants to be able to participate in the Spanish electoral processes, in which she shows great interest, according to 51% of those surveyed by the CCME. \"Moroccans in Spain are a collective. We pay our taxes, we pay contributions. Of course I would like to be able to vote\", says Meriem, who also feels more than integrated in Logroño, where she lives. \"There are many cases of discrimination that do nothing to help Moroccans integrate. I understand that there are people who can't, but in my case I have overcome them. I no longer feel like a foreigner here\", adds the young businesswoman, who is working to make a small brand of handmade and natural cosmetic products prosper in collaboration with her mother from Agadir.\n\nHanan El. and Riyan H are the two youngest interviewees and both have Spanish nationality. Both are studying and, in the case of Hanan, also working. For Hanan, who had to ask for it, the essential thing is the freedom it gives. \"It's not just for travelling, it's for everything,\" explains the young woman, who specialises in fashion design. \"To work and to study everything is much easier if it is with the nationality\". Hanan defines that rather than having a \"double identity\", she feels that she is neither on one side nor the other. \"Most of the Moroccans I know were born here in Spain, but they don't feel Spanish. But neither do they feel Moroccan\".\n\nAP/MOSA’AB ELSHAMY - Informal school run by Moroccan fashion designer Fadila El Gadi, in Sale, near Rabat\n\nSomething that these four young people of Moroccan origin agree on is one of the most striking features of the CCME's report on the interest shown by the diaspora in Moroccan electoral processes. If they all claim to be regularly informed about what is happening in Morocco, they also assume that they have no interest in wanting to vote in Morocco or in learning more about its politics. According to the CCME study, only 9% of those surveyed in Spain indicated a desire to participate in Moroccan elections, the second highest figure of the six countries surveyed.\n\nThe gap between politics and young people crosses borders. In Morocco, the low turnout of 18-29 year olds in the elections is one of the headlines that make the front pages every time. Around 30% of the Moroccan population is in the 18-29 age group and a further 27 % is under 14 years of age. The 18-24 turnout in the September 2021 elections was only a meagre 3%. It rose to 19% for 25-34, according to figures available in the Moroccan press.\n\nIf neither residents in Morocco nor residents in Spain are interested in these processes, it is mainly due to the lack of accessibility to them. \"I have never voted in my life,\" Sohaib confesses. \"I think that I and the other young people don't feel involved\", adds the Tangier journalist. In his opinion, the political parties make no effort to present their electoral programmes. \"I don't think it doesn't do much good. That's my conviction. I have always seen it as an archaic system,\" Sohaib concludes.\n\nRiyan, 20, a student of an intermediate degree in administration, has a very similar feeling to Sohaib. \"It's not something I find accessible. That's why I'm not interested in elections in Morocco or politics in general. I would still like to see a lot of changes, especially for young people,\" says the young student.\n\nIn addition to the low interest in politics and elections, this age group also gave the government a clear failing grade. In measuring the degree of satisfaction with the reforms undertaken by the Moroccan government, Akhannouch's government received only 18% approval in Spain, the lowest next to Germany (12%) and a far cry from Belgium's 57%.\n\n\"Young people expect nothing from the government. They just want to be able to work once they finish their studies,\" says Meriem. She agrees with Sohaib, who at least somewhat optimistically believes that young people want the country to prosper as much as possible. This is also the view of Riyan, who at least has a positive idea of Morocco because of what it means to him and his family. \"The culture, our roots. Of course we like Morocco,\" says Riyan, who believes that young people only have a problem with the institutions and the economic situation, which offers fewer opportunities compared to Europe.\n\nAs for the future, the youngest of these interviewees is very optimistic, and even the hopefulness is evident in his voice. \"I am sure that soon something similar to what is happening in France or Belgium will happen in Spain,\" says Riyan. \"I really believe that in the next few years we will see ministers or senior officials in Spain bearing a Moroccan name\".",

    "The Farce of Normalization: A Taste of Morocco and a Sip of \"Israel\"": "Normalizing ties with \"Israel\" is the official cementing of Israeli apartheid with despotic and reactionary Arab regimes, all in the name of furthering crude economic gains and regressive political ambitions.\n\nCanada’s leading Zionist lobby group held its annual parliamentary reception on September 20, 2022, and dedicated it to the \"Abraham Accords\" and in particular, the growing ties between Morocco and \"Israel\". The Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs (CIJA) picked up where they left off before Covid shut down such in-person events; and their Twitter feed was full of photos of various parliamentarians, including Canadian cabinet ministers, who attended the reception.\n\n“A taste of Morocco and a sip of Israel” was the theme for the night and highlighted the shameful normalization between the two. Morocco’s ambassador to Canada was there, and the Moroccan embassy itself was a cosponsor of the event along with the Israeli embassy. Interestingly, on its official Facebook account, the Moroccan embassy downplayed the other cosponsors and made no explicit mention of the involvement of \"Israel\" and its lobby group in organizing the reception, simply saying “Morocco guest of honor of the 2022 annual successful parliamentary reception, held this evening in Ottawa..”.\n\nHistorically, Morocco always had strong ties with successive Israeli governments, especially under the late King Hassan II. Ties that included information and intelligence exchange and as early as 1963, Mossad was reported to have opened an office in Morocco. Israeli intelligence officials later stated that King Hassan had passed them secret recordings of Arab leaders’ discussions at the 1965 Casablanca summit, which gave them a strategic advantage and helped \"Israel\" win the 1967 war.\n\nAnd in March 2013, Morocco acquired three Heron drones equipped with Israeli systems that had been routed through France and then transferred to the Moroccan Air Force after being painted in the appropriate colors.\n\nBut the new accord, signed in December 2020, can and will build on those ties and is hoping to cultivate $250 million worth of Israeli exports and business opportunities. Additionally, Israeli media speculated that “Morocco entered into a free trade agreement with Africa in early 2021, meaning it could also serve as a gateway to increasing trade with African countries in general.”\n\nNone of this treachery, however, seems to have disqualified Morocco as the chair of the Jerusalem Committee for the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.\n\nAnd now to the “sip of Israel”, which was of course Israeli wines. Most Israeli wines sold in Canada are linked to the illegal settlement enterprise; additionally, Canada still does not require any specific labeling of which wines are settlement products. According to CIJA, attendees to the reception came from “all parties”, and included the New Democratic Party leader, Jagmeet Singh, despite his recent affirmation to “end all trade and economic cooperation with illegal settlements...”.\n\nDid these parliamentarians and other guests in attendance know they were legitimizing the theft and plunder of Palestinian resources? Did any bother to question the wine that was being served? Did the Moroccan representatives and other foreign dignitaries know or care?\n\nHerein lies the real reasons that the Israeli government and its US sponsor are pushing the so-called Abraham Accords. They present the lie of “friendship” between certain Arab countries and \"Israel\" to the rest of the world and use it to further legitimize Israeli apartheid and everything it stands for. Arab regimes like Morocco get added international recognition and, in this case, support for their own occupation of Western Sahara and its huge mineral reserves. And Western politicians then join in the chorus and become the cheerleaders for such policies.\n\nAnd this is why activists across the world are adamant in denouncing this new “normalization” and are clear that it is a betrayal of the long-held aspirations of the people of the region. The so-called Abraham Accords are not the “brave success story for peace” that \"Israel\" and the Zionist lobby like to portray; rather they are an official cementing of Israeli apartheid with despotic and reactionary Arab regimes, all in the name of furthering crude economic gains and regressive political ambitions. We must say NO to such normalization!",

    "The New Humanitarian Melilla and Ceuta: What’s behind the deaths at Morocco’s land border with the EU?": "BARCELONA\n\nEarly on the morning of 24 June, around 2,000 asylum seekers and migrants – many from Sudan and South Sudan – attempted en masse to cross the border fence separating the Moroccan town of Nador from Spain’s North African exclave of Melilla.\n\nMoroccan security forces responded by firing tear gas and wielding batons. According to government accounts, 23 asylum seekers and migrants were killed. Local human rights groups say the true toll may be as high as 37. Dozens more were injured.\n\nMonths later, many of the details of what transpired and how the deaths occurred remain contested. International human rights organisations, the African Union, and the UN have called for an independent investigation, while the incident has thrown a fresh spotlight on Morocco’s role in broader EU efforts to try to curb migration.\n\n“[The violence] shouldn’t surprise us,” Judith Sunderland, associate director for Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia division, told The New Humanitarian. “It is almost as if the EU has accepted that violence is part of their toolbox when it comes to migration control.”\n\nMorocco is the only African country that shares a land border with the EU, at Melilla and at Spain’s other North African exclave, Ceuta. At the closest point across the Strait of Gibraltar, Morocco is also only 13 kilometres away from Spain by sea. This proximity has led to Morocco being both a country of origin and transit for asylum seekers and migrants trying to reach the EU, with numbers ebbing and flowing over the years.\n\nFollowing the 2015 migration crisis, as the EU acted to restrict the movement of people from Turkey and Libya – the two main departure countries at the time – towards Europe, arrivals from Morocco to Spain along what is known as the Western Mediterranean route spiked.\n\nIn 2018, more than 56,000 asylum seekers and migrants reached Spain via the Western Mediterranean route, making it the most active migration route towards Europe that year. A further 6,800 crossed the country’s land borders in Melilla and Ceuta.\n\nThe EU responded by providing an aid package of 148 million euros to Morocco – the vast majority of which went towards strengthening and supporting its ability to control its own borders. Arrivals on the Western Mediterranean route quickly dropped off, but starting in 2020, the route from Morocco’s west coast to the Spanish Canary islands in the Atlantic Ocean became more active.\n\nRead more →What’s driving the deadly migrant surge from Senegal to the Canary Islands?\n\n“Morocco’s contribution to managing irregular migration through the Atlantic/Western Mediterranean route is essential,” a European Commission spokesperson told The New Humanitarian. “The European Union wants to strengthen this partnership further.”\n\nWith Morocco, the EU, and Spain all vowing to deepen their migration cooperation in the wake of the violence and deaths in Melilla, we take a look at some key questions:\n\nWere diplomatic dealings between Morocco and Spain a key factor in the lead-up to the violence in Melilla?\n\nThe mass attempt by asylum seekers and migrants to cross the border into Melilla was not the first of its kind. On 17 and 18 April last year, an estimated 8,000 people – including 2,000 minors – swam or scaled the border fence to reach Spain’s other North African exclave, Ceuta.\n\nSpanish soldiers and border guards responded by pushing people back across the border – sometimes violently – and rounding up and returning to Morocco the vast majority of those who managed to cross over. Meanwhile, Moroccan border guards were conspicuously absent from the other side of the border and at times appeared to assist people attempting to get across.\n\nSpain and Morocco have had a stable relationship for years, and have coordinated closely with each other on border security since the 1990s – although the extent to which Morocco prioritises restricting irregular migration is closely linked to external pressure and incentives from the EU and Spain.\n\nA bilateral agreement signed between the two countries in 1992 allows Spain to request the readmission of people who have entered irregularly from Morocco. And Morocco has periodically cracked down on sub-Saharan asylum seekers and migrants in the country, including in 2018.\n\nIn April 2021, however, a diplomatic stand-off threatened this relationship when Spain allowed Brahim Ghali – the leader of the Polisario Front, a Western Sahara independence movement – to enter the country for COVID-19 treatment. Morocco annexed Western Sahara in 1975 after Spain withdrew as a colonial power, leading to a war with the Polisario Front that concluded in 1991 with a UN-brokered ceasefire agreement.\n\nUntil recently, much of the international community, including Spain, remained neutral in the conflict and backed UN efforts for a negotiated solution. Morocco saw Spain’s decision to extend medical treatment to Ghali as a breach of this neutrality and threatened repercussions. A month later, the mass crossing in Ceuta occurred.\n\nIn the aftermath of the crossings, Spain attempted to make concessions to the Moroccan government. But relations did not improve until the Spanish government publicly announced its support for Morocco’s territorial claim over Western Sahara in March this year. An agreement that paved the way for strengthened migration cooperation between Morocco and Spain went into effect around the same time.\n\n“It all went back to the issue of Western Sahara,” explained Lorena Stella Martini, advocacy and communications assistant for the European Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nWhile there’s no direct evidence that the reinvigorated relationship between Morocco and Spain led to the violence in Melilla this summer, Sunderland said the actions follow a clear pattern also seen in other countries the EU partners with to curb migration.\n\n“[There are often] crackdown[s] on undocumented migrants and asylum seekers in those countries on the heels of renewed declarations of partnership,” she said.\n\nHow have Spain, the EU, and Morocco responded to the incident?\n\nOn 24 June, in response to the attempted border crossing, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez praised the Moroccan authorities for their efforts in handling what he said was a “violent and organised assault”, and placed the blame for the incident on what he called human trafficking mafias.\n\nLater – after images and videos emerged showing Moroccan security forces holding truncheons, beating and kicking people, and standing over injured and exhausted people laying in piles on the ground – Sánchez attempted to distance himself from his initial comments, while still placing blame squarely on the shoulders of the “mafias”.\n\nThe Spanish public prosecutor has since opened an investigation into the deaths. HRW’s Sunderland, however, said she doubted it would be a “truly impartial one [that] will lead to actual truth and justice”.\n\nMeanwhile, Moroccan authorities have focused on prosecuting individuals involved in or accused of facilitating the crossing. Last month, 13 men from Sudan, South Sudan, and Chad were issued with fines and sentenced to two and a half years in prison. In July, 33 people were sentenced to 11 months in prison for “illegal entry” and “disobedience”.\n\nAn inquiry by Morocco’s state-affiliated National Council on Human Rights (CNDH) alleged that the deaths were likely caused by suffocation when people were crushed while trying to cross narrow border entry points, and maintained that Moroccan security forces only used violence in isolated incidents in response to the danger posed by asylum seekers and migrants carrying sticks and stones. Dozens of Moroccan border guards were reportedly injured during the incident.\n\nWatchdog groups, including the non-governmental Moroccan Association for Human Rights, said the CNDH’s probe was incomplete, and reiterated their calls for an independent investigation.\n\nAt the EU level, European Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson condemned the loss of life at the Moroccan-Spanish border in a speech on 4 July, but quickly shifted to focus on the role of smuggling networks in facilitating and encouraging irregular migration.\n\nFollowing a meeting in the Moroccan capital, Rabat, on 8 July between Johansson, Spain’s home affairs minister, and Morocco’s interior minister, the EU and Morocco announced a renewed joint effort to cooperate on migration and counter people smuggling, focused on border management and enhanced police cooperation.\n\nSaid Saddiki, a professor of international relations at Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University in Fez, said Morocco does need more support from the EU to manage migration. He explained that EU policies have increasingly turned Morocco into a destination for asylum seekers and migrants – instead of a transit country – and said Morocco lacks the resources to integrate people into its economic and social life.\n\nAt the same time, he said there’s also still a “mutual distrust” between Morocco and Spain stemming from colonial legacies and territorial disputes, among other issues, and Morocco – like other North African countries – does not want to act as a security guard for Europe’s borders without receiving anything in return.\n\nMeanwhile, the reliance on Morocco when it comes to managing migration leaves the EU vulnerable to the issue being used to exert political pressure on the bloc and on member states – as Turkey has done in recent years. “International issues are intertwined,” Saddiki added.\n\nWhat is the situation now for asylum seekers and migrants in Ceuta and Melilla?\n\nFor asylum seekers and migrants hoping to transit through Morocco to reach Spain and the EU, the renewed focus on managing migration and tackling people smuggling will likely “make it more difficult… to reach Europe”, said the ECFR’s Martini.\n\n“It is key that harsher controls do not result in dramatic episodes such as the one that happened at the border between Morocco and Melilla in June,” she added.\n\nBut human rights groups say that by putting the focus on combating people smuggling, Morocco and the EU are framing migration in a criminal context, which inevitably leads to directing hostile policies at asylum seekers and migrants trying to cross borders.\n\n“It is key that harsher controls do not result in dramatic episodes such as the one that happened at the border between Morocco and Melilla in June.”\n\nThis is evident in areas close to Morocco’s borders with Spain where, at any given time, hundreds of mostly sub-Saharan asylum seekers and migrants hoping to reach the EU live in informal camps or caves in “extremely vulnerable, precarious conditions”, according to Sunderland.\n\nMoroccan authorities also have a history of violently raiding these camps and bussing people away from the borders of Melilla and Ceuta to impoverished areas of southern Morocco, far from the coast and the Spanish exclaves, Sunderland added. These types of raids are often justified as part of the fight against irregular migration and human trafficking.\n\nMeanwhile, according to rights groups, those who do manage to make it to Spain face quickly being returned to Morocco, often without having the opportunity to apply for international protection, which is required under international law.\n\nNew legal migration pathways, as well as serious efforts to tackle the root causes that push people to leave in search of a better life, are desperately needed, according to Martini. “It remains to be seen how the EU and its member states will work and also cooperate with important partners such as Morocco to reach such goals,” she added.\n\nEdited by Eric Reidy and Anna Lekas Miller.",

    "Israel recalls Morocco envoy over sexual abuse allegations": "Israeli foreign ministry said it recalled its ambassador to Morocco over sexual abuse allegations and corruption.\n\nIsrael has summoned its ambassador to Morocco, David Govrin, over allegations of sexual harassment and corruption, Israeli media outlets have reported.\n\nThe Israeli foreign ministry confirmed Govrin’s recall to the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth on Tuesday, saying “the ambassador to Morocco [has been recalled] due to allegations of sexual abuse, harassment and corruption”.\n\nGovrin, 58, is a fluent Arabic speaker and had previously served as the ambassador to Egypt from 2016 to August 2020.\n\nHe will remain in Israel pending the ministry’s investigation into the allegations against him, the newspaper said.\n\nPublic broadcaster KAN said Israeli authorities were “investigating complaints over alleged actions carried out at the Israeli representation in Morocco”.\n\nThe broadcaster also referred to “another strange story concerning businessman Sami Cohen who officially hosted activities for senior Israeli officials” in Morocco.\n\nAccording to media reports, the businessman allegedly arranged meetings for senior Israeli officials with Moroccan official representatives, despite not holding any official position.\n\nAccording to The Times of Israel, the foreign ministry is also investigating the theft of a “precious gift” from the Moroccan Royal Court during Israel’s celebration of its foundation anniversary.\n\nSuch gifts have to be registered and turned over to the government, but the item appears to have disappeared with no record.\n\nThe most serious complaint was that “a senior Israeli official” at the mission had sexually exploited several local women, something that could lead to a severe diplomatic incident with Morocco. There were also complaints of sexual harassment within the mission.\n\nIf the allegations prove to be true, a serious diplomatic incident in relations between Israel and Morocco could be sparked.\n\nMorocco became the third Arab state to normalise ties with Israel under United States-brokered deals in 2020, joining the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. In return, the US – under former President Donald Trump – recognised Morocco’s claim over Western Sahara.",

    "Morocco acts to conserve water": "Climate change and a harsh summer have led to a severe drop in water reserves in Morocco.\n\nFaced with a reduction in rainfall levels, the authorities decided in July to ban the use of drinking water to irrigate green spaces and wash cars amongst other measures.\n\nThe decision is aimed at preventing the uncontrolled use of drinking water for any other purpose apart from human consumption.\n\n\"The decision is very difficult on me because I am used to resorting to a car wash to get my car clean. But now despite how busy life already is, I have to clean my car myself from time to time\" said Mustapha Yassine, a resident in Rabat.\n\nSince last year, the reserves in the dams have gone down by 80%, according to figures from Morocco's ministry of equipment.\n\nAnother Rabat resident, Abdellah Hassouni, added \"we the people took these decisions positively and tried to pass along the basic piece of information: it is important to conserve water, a basic substance needed in life and something that could become scarce in 10 or 20 years\".\n\nAgriculture accounts for 80% of water consumption in the country, and poor practices like the overexploitation of groundwater have stretched resources thin.\n\n\"Today, the water reserve situation in Morocco has become worrying, as is the case in neighbouring countries due to climate change conditions and the harshness of this summer, which has brought high temperatures. Temperatures have reached their highest levels at 48 and 49 degrees Celsius (118°F-120°F) in the southern and eastern regions, which led to the depletion of big puddles and large reserves of water\", confirmed Mustapha Laissate, president of Green Carpet Association in Rabat.\n\nMorocco is aiming to build 100 large dams, 1,000 small dams and 20 seawater desalination plants by 2030."
