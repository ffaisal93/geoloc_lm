    "Singapore Seeks To Transform Industries As World Enters New Era Of Global Trade: DPM Lawrence Wong": "Singapore deputy prime minister Lawrence Wong speaking at the Forbes Global CEO Conference in ... [+] Singapore. Forbes Asia\n\nSingapore deputy prime minister Lawrence Wong said the city-state is constantly reinventing itself to remain relevant as the world enters a new era of global trade.\n\n“We do not take things for granted,” Wong, who is also the country’s finance minister, said at the Forbes Global CEO Conference in Singapore. “We are always paranoid that somebody else will take our lunch.” Wong made his remarks during a key note address at the event.\n\nWong said the government is pushing ahead to expand the capacity of its airport and seaport to accommodate increasing trade flows, while at the same time encouraging the adoption of digital technologies in the finance industry to bolster the country’s position as an Asian financial hub.\n\nEarlier this year, Singapore said it’s forging ahead with a S$20 billion ($14 billion) project to build the world’s biggest port by 2040. At the same time, it plans to build a fifth passenger terminal at Changi Airport that will be mostly automated and capable of handling an additional 50 million travelers a year. “We want to make sure that capacity is in place to meet increased demand,” he said.\n\nThe investments will help Singapore retain its key position as a reliable and trusted node in the global supply chain, Wong said. “We are entering a new era of global order,” Wong said. “There are tremendous uncertainties all around us.”\n\nApart from the disruptions in the global supply chain caused by the pandemic and deteriorating relations between China and the U.S., the world has been grappling with surging inflation and rising interest rates. “Geopolitics will drive trade and investment,” Wong said. “It will lead us to a more dangerous and fragmented world.”\n\nWong—who is largely anticipated to become Singapore’s next prime minister to replace Lee Hsien Loong—said no decision has been made as to when the transition will happen. He stressed that the government is focused first on addressing rising inflation and cushioning the impact of the potential economic slowdown next year.“We will do it when we’re ready,” he said.",

    "Why the Singapore Grand Prix is so extreme for F1 drivers": "After a COVID-19 forced hiatus, Formula 1 finally returns to the streets of Marina Bay this weekend for the Singapore Grand Prix. F1's original night race, Singapore has firmly become a fan and driver favourite, snaking through the city and under motorways as locals continue on with their daily lives. It has created some memorable moments down the years, from the inaugural race in 2008 - the 800th World Championship event - to the famous start line collision in 2017 between Sebastian Vettel, Max Verstappen and Kimi Raikkonen. However, the Singapore Grand Prix is also famous as one of the toughest events of the entire season, with drivers modifying their training regimen to adapt to the unique demands of the track. But why is Singapore so demanding?\n\nHumidity the main factor Logic would dictate that a night race is cooler as the Sun is not up - but Singapore is about 85 miles from the equator, meaning humidity is high. In September, when the race is usually run (it is on October 2nd this year), humidity in the day is about 96%. That's ok for teams and drivers as they stay on European time, meaning they are asleep during the daylight hours, with Singapore seven hours ahead of Great Britain. At night, when all the sessions are run, humidity falls slightly to 80% or so. Throw in the air temperature, and being surrounded by multiple levels of fireproof Nomex, in a confined space with all sorts of electrical gubbins behind you, and it can get rather toasty in the cockpit, with temperatures rising to around 60 degrees Celsius.\n\n© XPBimages\n\nThe very nature of the race At 3.146 miles, Marina Bay is quite a long track, with 23 corners from start to finish. However, the longest straight is just 800m long down Raffles Boulevard - the run from Turns 5-7 - meaning there is little time for the drivers to rest on the straights. The Turn 7 left-hander at the end of Raffles is also the prime overtaking spot on the circuit, meaning a driver has to be careful not to be mugged on the brakes. At 61 laps, the race often passes close to the two-hour time limit for Grands Prix, meaning drivers know they are in for the long haul. In 2013, the famous 'Singapore Sling' chicane was removed, thus making the track faster through its replacement - a fast left-hander.\n\nViewed by others: Interview Jacques Villeneuve Villeneuve aiming for NASCAR but still hopes for legendary record\n\nWhat the drivers say Mercedes released a video of George Russell preparing for his second race in Singapore, showing the British driver cycling in sweat catching gear, looking rather tired. Pierre Gasly spoke about his \"love\" for the \"extreme conditions\" found in Singapore - which is unique now on the F1 calendar after Malaysia fell away in 2017. However, drivers are fearful of the physical battering they are going to take over the bumps, especially with the new breed of car. \"It's going to be very bumpy, and a big challenge for us. [It will be] very physical,\" said Esteban Ocon. \"I love Singapore, but the track itself is not my favourite, I have to say.\"",
    "Singapore's Temasek leads a $40 million funding round in a Chinese startup": "In just three years, Beijing-based Well-Link Technologies has built a business on real-time cloud rendering, including helping miHoYo launch the cloud version of the hit game Genshin Impact. Ina Fassbender | Afp | Getty Images\n\nBEIJING — Singapore state investment firm Temasek is leading a $40 million funding round in a Chinese startup despite a dry spell of deals in the country. The startup, Well-Link Technologies, counts Chinese tech company Xiaomi and Chinese gaming star miHoYo as investors, according to business database Tianyancha. The $40 million deal announced Monday is an early-stage, or B2 round, led by Temasek and includes existing shareholders Future Capital and CDH Venture and Growth Capital. Temasek confirmed the deal in an email. The Singapore firm's publicly disclosed exposure to China has declined over the last two years, from 29% in 2020 to 22% as of this March. As of last week, Temasek had only participated in eight China financing deals, down from 41 last year, according to Dealogic.\n\nwatch now\n\nIn just three years, Beijing-based Well-Link Technologies has built a business on real-time cloud rendering, including helping miHoYo launch the cloud version of the hit game Genshin Impact. Cloud rendering uses multiple servers on the cloud, rather than a single computer, to make the computations necessary for creating images such as animations and movies. Cloud gaming requires fast processing speed since it relies on remote servers and an internet connection to offer people a smooth gaming experience with just a small file download. For example, the cloud version of Genshin Impact is just 78.5 megabytes on Apple's App Store in China, versus the exponentially larger 3.7 gigabytes for the non-cloud version.\n\nSoaring revenue\n\nWell-Link claims its revenue for each of the last two years has grown by a whopping 400% or more, putting the company on track for revenue of several hundred million yuan — the equivalent of tens of millions of U.S. dollars. CEO Guo Jianjun told reporters the valuation that Temasek offered wasn't the highest one the startup received. But he said the latest financing round is part of the company's plans to expand its business overseas. It was difficult to raise funds during the pandemic, and the startup still has a lot of money, Guo said. But he added that he's confident in Well-Link's future development and wants to stick to its fundraising plan. One of Well-Link's next steps is encouraging more developers to create games that originate in the cloud. The company is also exploring how its real-time cloud rendering tech can help with the development of virtual reality and other technologies of the future.",
    "Ashique Kuruniyan’s strike helps India secure 1-1 draw against Singapore": "The Indian men’s football team began the three-nation Hung Thinh friendly tournament with a 1-1 draw against Singapore at the Thong Nhat Stadium in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam on Saturday.\n\nSingapore’s Ikhsan Fandi (37’) scored the opening goal of the match before India’s Ashique Kuruniyan (43’) restored the parity. It was the first football match between the two sides in 10 years.\n\nBoth teams enjoyed equal possession in the opening 15 minutes without any meaningful openings.\n\nIndia, ranked 104 in world football, was quicker on the flanks, but world No. 159 Singapore occasionally relied on aerial balls to pierce the Indian defence.\n\nIndia began to look more threatening as the match progressed, earning back-to-back corners in the 31st minute. However, both the chances were snuffed out by the resilient Singaporean backline.\n\nSingapore won a free-kick just outside the box following a clumsy challenge by India's Ashique Kuruniyan in the 37th minute.\n\nThe powerful strike from Singapore forward Ikshan Fandi took a heavy deflection from India's three-member wall, eventually beating goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu to give Singapore a 1-0 lead.\n\nIndia responded with three minutes to play in the first half through Ashique Kuruniyan's clinical low shot from inside the box. The assist came from Indian captain Sunil Chhetri, who beat two Singapore defenders to provide Kuruniyan with a perfect pass.\n\nThere was nothing to separate the two sides in terms of possession at the end of the first half. India, however, had more shots on target compared to Singapore.\n\nIndia began the second half well but Singapore goalkeeper Hassan Sunny pulled off two crucial saves in the first five minutes.\n\nSunil Chhetri too stepped up with a header from the corner but Sunny was at the right spot to keep Singapore in the game.\n\nSingapore made a double change in the 59th minute but Indian attacks kept on coming.\n\nIndia squandered multiple chances in the remainder of the second half to go 2-1 up.\n\nRoshan failed to convert Liston Colaco’s short free-kick pass into a goal in the 65th minute.\n\nTen minutes later, Liston Colaco’s powerful shot from the left aimed at the Singapore goal-keeper’s near-post missed the target by inches.\n\nForward Ishan Pandita, who replaced Sunil Chhetri, too couldn’t find the net from the centre of the box in the 86th minute.\n\nThis was India’s first international match since winning matches against Cambodia, Afghanistan and Hong Kong at the AFC Asian Cup 2023 qualifiers back in June. Singapore, meanwhile, came into the match losing 4-0 to Vietnam on Wednesday.\n\nIndia next play Vietnam at the same venue on Tuesday.",
    "House of the year, Singapore: OCBC": "OCBC Bank has again demonstrated its preeminence among Singapore banks this past year, through leadership in the local interest rate benchmark transition, market-leading ESG (environment, social and governance) investment offerings, and innovative digital solutions for its foreign exchange clients.\n\n\n\nAt a time when the market was awaiting the outcome of a consultation by the Monetary Authority of Singapore on the adjustment spreads for the transition of legacy swap offered rate (SOR) contracts in the wholesale market, OCBC, together with another commercial bank, completed a 30-year overnight indexed swap (OIS) derivatives transaction in July this year using the Singapore Overnight Rate Average (Sora) as the interest rate benchmark. The bank believes it to be the first long-tenor Sora OIS trade in the city-state.\n\n\n\nThe biggest challenge, according to Wee Wei Min, global head of sales and structuring, global treasury at OCBC Bank, lies in the long tenor of the transaction because of a dearth of liquidity on that part of the Sora curve. Wee says OCBC overcame this challenge by marrying its corporate and institutional clients to create liquidity.\n\n“OCBC was able to transit a long-dated overnight indexed swap, amortising SOR-based interest rate swap into Sora with our client. OCBC was able to break down the trade into the various tenor buckets against the offsetting flows from our network of clients. This solution worked successfully and sets the precedent in the collaboration process across teams for other long-dated deals to be transited,” she says.\n\n\n\nWee says the fact the bank had senior leaders sitting on the legacy contract conversion sub-committee and the trading sub-committee of the Steering Committee for SOR and Sibor transition to Sora has not only helped the industry make the transition, but also the bank.\n\nOCBC has a long history of leadership in Singapore’s local benchmark transition. In 2019, for instance, OCBC and another commercial bank traded Singapore’s first OIS derivatives transaction using Sora.\n\nOCBC has also executed a number of sustainable finance transactions in the past 12 months, further cementing its title as a frontrunner in the ESG space. One example was a transaction for a real estate investment trust, First REIT. The bank also priced the Housing Development Board’s first green bond and a repeat sustainability-linked issuance for Sembcorp.\n\n“As ESG bonds have a scarcity factor in the Singapore dollar market, we envisioned that investor demand for such instruments will be forthcoming and we lead-managed the market’s first social bond for First REIT, an SGX-listed healthcare-focused REIT. The transaction was aligned with the REIT’s newly established social finance framework, which ties in with the United Nations’ sustainability development goals. In helping these issuers, we created a meaningful platform to further ESG bond issuances, deepening the ESG footprint in the Singapore bond market.”\n\n\n\nLike all banks, OCBC is also very much in the throes of its digital journey. One of its key initiatives – FX Online – the bank’s digital FX platform, which was launched in 2020, has seen further improvements in the past year. These improvements have included leveraging machine learning and robotic process automation, as well as deeper cooperation among the departments within the bank, to offer solutions that are directly relevant to clients’ financing needs instead of overwhelming them with information.\n\n\n\nBy leveraging machine learning and robotic process automation on FX Online, the bank is able to prompt its customers while on the go about FX exposures that need to be managed through its Business Mobile Banking app.\n\n“We are not going to sit and tell them that this is only for a certain kind of deals. Our game, perhaps the end state could be that as long as you want to hedge or invest, you can do so regardless of the channels and where you are. You could be at the airport waiting to catch a plane, and when prompted by OCBC that this is the best time to hedge your Singapore dollar exposure, you are able to do so,” says Gerard Tan, managing director and head of digital market strategy, global treasury at OCBC.\n\n\n\nThe bank’s strategy in offering solutions that seek to add value is also palpable in the market insight it provides its clients for their currency needs. Tan says the bank seeks to ensure the information it provides is relevant to clients and offers advisory on how best to capture opportunities and market dislocation rather than overloading them with information.",

    "Why a good night's sleep is not just a Singapore GP issue": "Listen to this article\n\nSince the first night race back in 2008, F1 folk have grown used to adjusting to the schedule by staying up until dawn and sleeping until the early afternoon in an attempt to stay on European time. Against the backdrop of the inevitable jet lag on arrival, it's never an easy thing to manage.\n\nThe reality is that while good sleep becomes a topic of paddock conversation around the Singapore GP, it makes a crucial contribution to mental and physical fitness at any time. For F1 drivers and team members facing a hectic calendar with more night events and more travel, it's becoming an increasingly important issue.\n\nThat's why teams are now looking at ways of improving the quality of sleep of drivers and crew members.\n\n\"Sleep is the foundation of everything else that we try to do in terms of well-being,\" says Mercedes team physician Dr Luke Bennett.\n\n\"You can train hard, you can train well, you can eat right, you can do all of those things properly. But if you're not sleeping well, then you're not going to get the impact that you need.\n\n\"And that goes as much for the race team members as it does for the drivers or any other athlete.\"\n\nFormerly a trauma specialist in Australia, Bennett volunteered at grands prix in Melbourne and Korea before joining Hintsa Performance, the organisation whose physios work with many drivers and teams across at the grid.\n\nOver the past decade, he's played an important, if largely unheralded role in helping Mercedes to achieve so much success.\n\nMechanics in the garage with George Russell, Mercedes W13 Photo by: Steve Etherington / Motorsport Images\n\n\"In our sport, where the technology is such a focus, I think human performance and well-being is genuinely valued by the teams,\" says Bennett. \"But it can often slip as a priority.\n\n\"The budget cap has changed that. And there's a real emphasis now on extracting the maximum from the human beings who travel the planet, operating this race team.\n\n\"And that's gained even further urgency with a calendar like the one that we're going to have next year, where the number of races is increasing. And the geographical complexity of the calendar makes something like sleep just an absolutely key part of the performance of not just the drivers, but the whole race team.\"\n\nKeeping drivers mentally fit over a gruelling grand prix weekend is a top priority for the people around them, notably their physios.\n\n\"I think most people appreciate that driving that car for up to two hours is an extraordinarily physical experience,\" says Bennett.\n\n\"But across the race weekend, there's also a huge cognitive demand for a driver. That steering wheel has 20 to 30 buttons and menus and sub-menus, which they're navigating sometimes even from corner to corner.\n\n\"The drivers sit through something like seven hours of engineering meetings across a race weekend, and then other countless hours of marketing and media duties, as well as the travel.\n\n\"You can quickly understand why sleep is not just a very important part of making sure that their physical preparation is consolidated. But it's also about making sure that they can still hit that apex millimetre to millimetre lap after lap on a Sunday afternoon when they've been through an extraordinarily demanding weekend even up to that point.\"\n\nWhen it first arrived on the schedule Singapore presented some special challenges for team doctors and physios. Over the years they have learned how to keep the drivers in tip-top condition.\n\nCharles Leclerc, Ferrari SF90, and Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes AMG F1 W10, lead the field away at the start Photo by: Joe Portlock / Motorsport Images\n\n\"There's some very unique sleep and physiological stresses about that event,\" says Bennett. \"It's notionally conducted on European time, but we have all of this incredibly bright artificial lighting. We have mid-afternoon wake-ups, we have a couple of finishes after sunrise. So it's not as simple as staying on European time.\n\n\"It's an incredibly disruptive week for sleep. We then have a one-day turnaround and a flight to Japan, where we go immediately onto a day schedule. It's easily the most brutal back-to-back that we see on the calendar.\n\n\"And in previous years I guess it's fair to say it's been a survival exercise for most people. We now have ways to not necessarily optimise but to manage this stress at a time of the season where championships are often being decided.\n\n\"It starts ideally with preparation before travel. Looking at the daily schedule, you want the driver to maybe shift a couple of hours, and they can do that effectively in the few days before they travel.\n\n\"You want to select the flight appropriately, depending on what time of day they want to arrive and what their commitments will be. I've heard it said that you can drill down to selecting which side of the aircraft you sit on, in terms of light exposure through different parts of the aircraft.\n\n\"We'll then be talking about precisely when to be exposed to light, when to maximise light exposure, when to seek darkness or a heavily shaded room, when to wear sunglasses in the later part of the day, Melatonin supplements, and then timing of exercise and meals. All those variables go into the mix of a really good jet lag plan.\"\n\nAt the heart of it all is getting some decent sleep when the driver finally gets back to his hotel room.\n\nLewis Hamilton, Mercedes AMG F1 Photo by: Sam Bloxham / Motorsport Images\n\n\"Sleep has probably had a popular renaissance over the last few years,\" says Bennett. \"I think there's an appreciation that it's not just the part of your day that gives way to all other activities. It's so important for consolidating all of the other important physiology that you have.\n\n\"But it's not just sleep. As a broad concept, I think everybody understands how important that is. But I would say even over the last year the physiology of temperature around sleep is really becoming recognised as probably as important as things like light and dark manipulation, which were traditionally considered to be the most important variables around sleep.\n\n\"The physiology about how temperature affects the depth of your sleep, phases of your sleep, the healthy phases of REM and deep sleep, and then how that affects your performance, both physically and mentally the following day. It's all logged pretty closely to temperature, and I think it's a pretty exciting field.\"\n\nThis year Mercedes has taken an interesting step in exploring the subject further by partnering with Eight Sleep, a company whose products focus on how temperature impacts sleep, and how it can be used to improve it.\n\nThe Eight Sleep \"pod\" comes in two forms, either as a complete mattress or as a mattress cover that can also potentially be transported. It works in conjunction with box that sits next to the bed, and a phone app.\n\n\"It's essentially a sensor layer, a mattress pad that you can install onto any mattress,\" says Eight Sleep co-founder Matteo Franceschetti.\n\n\"It will do a couple of different things. First of all, it's like sleeping on a stethoscope. There are sensors embedded that you don't feel that are able to track everything about your heart rate, your respiration and your sleep quality.\n\n\"And we are reaching medical grade accuracy in a couple of these dimensions, meaning that your bed is comparable to a medical grade device.\n\nLewis Hamilton, Mercedes AMG F1 Photo by: Sam Bloxham / Motorsport Images\n\n\"But the key difference between us and a wearable is that the wearable tracks the data and reports the data to you. But it doesn't do much more than that. In our case, we use the data to then adjust the temperature and control your body temperature.\"\n\nThat's the key to how the Eight Sleep pod improves your sleep, as Franceschetti notes: \"The bottom line is each side of the bed can have a different temperature, and the temperature will change during the night to optimise your recovery.\n\n\"We didn't reinvent the wheel, meaning that there is already plenty of medical evidence that temperature at night can improve your sleep performance and your body temperature changes. When you hear people saying, 'You should sleep at 68degF (20degC) the whole night,' that is wrong.\n\n\"And the reason is 68degF could work for one hour out of the eight hours. But for the other seven hours, you need a different temperature. And that is what our device does.\"\n\nFranceschetti stresses that the idea is to promote what the company calls sleep fitness.\n\n\"Everything started at first from a certain vision that we had internally,\" he says. \"Most of the time when you think of bedding companies you think about comfort and cosiness. Our approach has always been different, because I used to be an athlete.\n\n\"And I always thought of sleep not just as relaxation, but also recovery. And that is how we came up with this concept of sleep fitness, which means you need to put the work in, you need to put the effort and the hours in when you go to bed, as you will do in the gym. But then you wake up fully refreshed, energised and healthier.\"\n\nSo what are the tangible benefits of better sleep for an athlete like a racing driver, or indeed for anybody else?\n\n\"There are some ways that are more obvious,\" says Franceschetti. \"Like reaction time, mental clarity, cognitive performance and focus, which are pretty obvious.\n\n\"But then there are also I would say almost second order effects that are effects on your own health. So lower heart rate and higher HRV [heart race variability], which is another proxy for physical stress and recovery, overall better health.

    "Ningbo to turn tides on Singapore as boxes keep flowing in": "China’s Ningbo-Zhoushan port has witnessed a flourishing growth in the container sector, as it draws nearer to Singapore – currently the world’s second busiest container port.\n\nAlphaliner’s latest data noted that the Chinese port handled a total of 17.54 million TEU in the first half of 2022, just 1.08 million TEU less than Singapore versus 2.7 million TEU in the same period a year ago and 4 million TEU prior to the pandemic.\n\nRecord-breaking results were also registered in Q2 following the three-month lockdown of Shanghai, which reportedly boosted the port’s volume growth as transpacific cargo was substantially diverted to Ningbo-Zhoushan.\n\n“Indeed Ningbo-Zhoushan even overtook Singapore in Q2 though figures were undoubtedly boosted by the extraordinary Shanghai lockdowns in April and May,” noted Alphaliner.\n\n“Ningbo-Zhoushan has benefitted from restrictions at its lock-down hit neighbour Shanghai, with many carriers diverting ships to avoid delays and trucking issues.”\n\n© Alphaliner\n\nHowever, the port has been witnessing continued growth since July – handling 3.28 million TEU up 26 per cent on the year before even as volumes bounced back at Shanghai.\n\nREAD: Shanghai Port to build new $7.2 billion box terminal\n\nSingapore ended H1 posting a drop in volumes by 1.7 per cent compared to the same period the year prior, against Ningbo’s 8.8 per cent climb.\n\nIn April the East China Port of Ningbo-Zhoushan hit a record monthly 3 million TEU.\n\nChina’s eight ports in Alphaliner’s rankings scored 53 per cent of total throughput for the leading 20 ports, although recent data showed the trend might go downwards as more lockdowns in the country have been recently imposed.\n\nEarlier this month, local authorities ordered the stop of all operations at Chinese major ports as Muifa, one of this year’s strongest typhoons, hit the country’s coastal areas on 14 September.",
    "Singapore Receives Checklist For Net-Zero Emissions Pathway": "Singapore aims to be a global hub for sustainable aviation and has produced a blueprint for how that transition might work.\n\nOn Friday, a high-level advisory panel presented its recommendations for decarbonizing the aviation sector in Singapore. The 20-member International Advisory Panel (IAP) submitted its report, containing 15 key initiatives, to Singapore's Minister for Transportation, Mr. S Iswaran.\n\nThe IAP, chaired by Professor Chong Tow Chong, president of the Singapore University of Technology and Design, was formed in February this year. Its charter was to \"discuss how international aviation can be made more sustainable and accessible, and how Singapore can contribute to this international effort.\" The members include leaders and senior executives from organizations including Airbus, Boeing, Singapore Airlines, Rolls-Royce, Neste, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA).\n\nMust build a complete SAF ecosystem\n\nSingapore Airlines uplifting SAF at Changi Airport with representatives from CAAS, SIA, Temasek, ExxonMobil and Neste. Photo: SIA\n\nThe panel's report, released by the CAAS, details 15 key initiatives across the three aviation domains of the airport, airline and air traffic management. In the airline domain, the IAP says that flight operations account for the bulk of global aviation emissions, and decarbonization will require significant action in this domain. It recommends five initiatives focused on improving the sustainability of airlines operating to, from and through Singapore, starting with the supply of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The report recommends that CAAS work with stakeholders to develop and implement a roadmap to create a long-term, secured ecosystem for SAF supply in Singapore and the region.\n\nThe panel recognizes the SAF supply chain needs to be \"incentivized\" and that strengthening the demand signals will encourage more SAF production. To achieve that, it recommends a 'buyers club' be established to bring together early adopters and aggregate SAF demand, sending clearer signals to producers of the size of the opportunity. The report adds:\n\n\"As a global business and logistics hub, Singapore has opportunities to tap on business travelers and air cargo users and encourage them to become first movers by joining the corporate buyers club. Thereafter, there is also the potential of collaborating with regional partners to expand the buyer's club to the broader ASEAN region.\"\n\nAs a major international hub, Singapore must also ensure that the region's feedstock for producing SAF aligns with global standards. Leading SAF producer Neste is building a $1.5 billion facility in Singapore with the capacity to produce one million metric tonnes of SAF annually, which is due for completion in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nNew aircraft technology on Singapore's radar\n\nAirbus has released three proposed hydrogen zero-emission aircraft. Photo: Airbus\n\nBeyond making existing aircraft more sustainable, the panel also looked into emerging propulsion technologies now under development. It believes that Singapore needs to be at the forefront of advancements in aviation technology to gain the full benefits. To drive that, it says that CAAS needs to work with stakeholders to explore setting up a technical center in Singapore that taps into the nation's extensive research and development ecosystem. The proposed center would collaborate with aircraft original equipment manufacturers and other aviation partners to build capabilities and be at the forefront of future developments. It specifically mentions this would complement the existing efforts at Changi Aiport exploring the use of hydrogen.\n\nFind more news about Asian aviation here\n\nIn the airport domain, the panel listed six initiatives to improve sustainability at Changi Airport, mainly by switching to renewable energy and improving efficiency. These include more solar panel deployment on the airfield, greater use of clean-energy airside vehicles and investigating an onsite waste-to-energy facility.\n\nThese findings will form part of the 'Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint,' to be published next year. The blueprint will outline the roadmap for decarbonizing aviation for the Singapore air hub, with medium-term 2030 and longer-term 2050 targets and strategies. Singapore wants to become a global hub for sustainable aviation, and this IAP report is a critical marker in that journey.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on when SAF might be available at scale?\n\nSource: CAAS",
    "Singapore factory output sees weakest growth in 11 months as electronics production falls": "SINGAPORE - The growth in Singapore's manufacturing output slowed further in August, as production in the key electronics sector shrank for a second month in a row.\n\nWeakness in the electronics cluster, which represents 40 per cent of Singapore’s industrial output, may drag the overall performance of the export-driven economy as rising inflation and interest rate hikes suppress consumer demand worldwide, analysts said.\n\nTotal output grew 0.5 per cent last month year on year after a revised 0.8 per cent expansion in July, according to data released by the Economic Development Board (EDB) on Monday.\n\nThe pace of growth in August was the slowest since September 2021, when output declined by 2 per cent.\n\nExcluding biomedical manufacturing, output shrank 1.2 per cent, EDB said.\n\nHowever, the overall output growth was better than the 0.7 per cent drop analysts had predicted in a Bloomberg poll.\n\nThe key electronics sector saw its production declining by 7.8 per cent, more than the 5.9 per cent drop in July.\n\nAll segments within the sector recorded a fall in output on the back of softening demand, led by a 19.3 per cent slide in the production of electronic modules and components.\n\nInfocomms and consumer electronics output fell 11.7 per cent, followed by a 6.6 per cent drop for semiconductors - a third straight month of decline - and a 5.5 per cent fall in computer peripherals and data storage.\n\nConcerns of a sharp global semiconductor down cycle have been on the rise after major chip companies, such as Micron, Intel, and Nvidia, predicted a weaker demand outlook for the sector through 2022 and probably 2023 as well.\n\nChemicals output decreased 11.2 per cent, as the specialties chemicals segment posted a 14 per cent drop.\n\nStill, the petroleum segment grew 8.1 per cent on account of higher demand for jet fuel driven by the relaxation of global air travel restrictions.\n\nBoth the electronics and chemicals sectors have been hit by slowing global demand, especially from China, which accounts for nearly 15 per cent of Singapore's exports.\n\nChina's economic growth slowed to 2.6 per cent in the first half, nearly half of the 5.5 per cent target set by Beijing for the whole of 2022.",
    "Shifting financial centres sees Singapore overtake Hong Kong": "Hong Kong’s long-standing reign as the world’s third most important city for global finance, and Asia’s top financial hub, is over – for now.\n\nThe city has handed its financial centre crown to Singapore, which finally overtakes it to become Asia’s top financial hub and the third worldwide.\n\nSingapore moved up three places to third place in the latest Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI) of the world’s leading international financial centres, behind New York and London, while Hong Kong slipped to fourth place.\n\nHong Kong battered by strict Covid-19 restrictions\n\nThis comes as Hong Kong struggles to revive its role as a global finance centre, following a ‘zero Covid’ policy the city has had in place for more than two years, requiring visitors to spend as much as 21 days in a hotel or quarantine facility upon arrival.\n\nThese measures have weighed on the city’s economy over the last year, with the city seeing an exodus of top financial talent to Singapore with the Lion City reaping the benefits.\n\nAccording to the European Union Office to Hong Kong and Macao, around 10% of EU citizens living in Hong Kong have left the city, and rising numbers of employees have asked to be relocated. Citigroup quietly moved a half a dozen equities bankers to Singapore and other markets, while a similar number of MDs at JPMorgan also left earlier this year.\n\nIn August, the city’s government revised downward its growth forecast for the economy to -0.5% to 0.5%, citing worse-than-expected economic performance in the first half.\n\nA similar fate has befallen Japan, whose Covid-19 measures have been similarly restrictive with Tokyo plunging by seven spots in the latest GFCI rankings to 16th place.\n\n“Continuing travel restrictions in places like Hong Kong and Tokyo affect their ability to conduct normal levels of business,” the report’s authors said.\n\nThat said, the Chinese cities of Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen all maintain spots in the GFCI’s top 10, despite equally crippling Covid-19 mitigation measures that have almost cut off China from the rest of the world.",
    "Singapore strives to remain relevant amid regulatory tightening for retail investors": "Singapore's largest bank, DBS, has announced another move to expand its crypto services while remaining cautious in complying with the financial authorities' view that crypto assets are not suitable for retail investors in the country.\n\nOn Friday, the bank disclosed its decision to expand crypto trading services on its digital exchange (DDEx) to approximately 100,000 \"wealth clients who are accredited investors.\" Investors who are considered accredited must meet certain criteria regarding their income, net worth, qualifications and understanding of financial markets.\n\nCaroline Malcolm, head of international public policy and research at Chainalysis, noted:\n\n\"Singapore has long indicated that it views most crypto assets as volatile and as a result, not well-suited to retail investors. At the same time though, it continues to indicate its support for DLT-based innovation, such as in the area of asset tokenization.\"\n\nPreviously, the DDEx was only available to corporate and institutional investors, family offices and DBS Private Bank and Treasures Private Client customers. DBS is also a trust anchor for the pilot Project Guardian in Singapore, a blockchain-based liquidity pool of tokenized bonds and deposits for borrowing and lending transactions.\n\nThe move comes after dramatic months for the crypto space in the country that was once ranked as the most crypto-friendly in the world due to its positive legislative environment. In June, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)’s chief fintech officer, Sopnendu Mohanty, said in an interview that “if somebody has done a bad thing [in the cryptocurrency industry], we are brutal and unrelentingly hard.”\n\nAnother chapter in the regulatory tightening came weeks later, as the authority sent detailed questionnaires to some applicants and holders of the MAS’ Digital Payment Token licenses, reportedly seeking “highly granular information” about business activities. The questions included top tokens owned and staked via DeFi protocols and aimed to intensify the spotlight on crypto firms amid upcoming regulations.\n\nThe new framework responds to issues with liquidity and withdrawals that have occurred with firms in the country this year. During this crypto winter, Three Arrows Capital (3AC) went bankrupt after failing to meet margin calls in mid-June.\n\n\"After recent events, from the Terra-Luna crash, to 3AC, and also the Hodlnaut exchange collapse, I expect we will see more such measures, aimed at further protecting consumers in the crypto asset market, in the future.\"\n\nThe updated regulatory approach does not seem sufficient to keep crypto firms out of the country. RRMine Global, a Filecoin service provider, recently announced that it has shut down business operations in mainland China and is relocating its headquarters to Singapore after Chinese restrictions narrowed operations for Web3 companies.\n\nNext week, Singapore will host Token2049, an industry conference that was held in Hong Kong before the pandemic. The event is expected to receive over 5,000 attendees, according to its organization.",

    "Singapore tops financial inclusivity rankings": "Singapore ranks number one globally for financial inclusivity, according to the inaugural Global Financial Inclusion Index, published by investment management and insurance company Principal Financial Group and UK-based think tank the Centre for Economics and Business Research.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, financial inclusion is defined as individuals and businesses having access to useful and affordable financial products and services that meet their needs delivered in a responsible and sustainable way. The UN identifies financial inclusion as an enabler for economic growth as well as a key component in several of its 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nThe index examined 42 markets globally, ranking them for financial inclusivity based on three pillars – government support, financial system support and employer support – and looking at the extent to which each of these pillars enables a market’s population to achieve financial inclusivity.\n\nGovernment support rates, among other things, the existence and coverage of deposit schemes and the scope of consumer protection, while financial system support looks at use of real-time payments, fintech developments and access to credit and bank accounts. Employer support examines employee pension contributions and employee insurance programmes.\n\nSingapore topped the index largely due to strong scores in the government and financial system support pillars, ranking first and third respectively. It fared less well in the employer support pillar, where it finished 14th.\n\nIts high score in the government support pillar was largely due to its streamlined corporate tax system, while it also had a strong showing in the education and employment indicators. It performed less well for the availability of government-provided financial education and deposit protection scheme indicators.\n\nIts high ranking in financial system support was largely due to the relative ease of access to credit, a high percentage of the population having access to bank accounts and the strength of its fintech sector. It scored less well for enabling SME growth.\n\nIn employer support, it ranked sixth for employee pension contributions but lower for the rest of the pillar’s indicators.\n\nHong Kong ranked fourth overall in the financial inclusivity index and was the only market to rank in the top 10 across all three pillars.",
    "Cities + Water: Singapore": "When it comes to water management, Singapore embodies the cliche that “necessity is the mother of invention.”\n\nAccording to the World Resources Institute (WRI), Singapore is the fifth most-likely country to experience extremely high water stress by 2040. In part, this stems from Singapore being one of the most densely-populated countries in the world, housing around 5.5 million people on a land area of just 733 square kilometers – smaller than that of New York City.\n\nIt’s also due to the tiny island being extremely low-lying, with its highest point reaching just 164 meters and most of its area sitting at less than five meters above the mean sea level. There’s high rainfall during the wet season but little groundwater, and only limited amounts of land are available for water storage facilities. When it rains heavily, the largely urban, concreted environment faces significant flood risks; and when it’s dry, water supply is a major issue.\n\n“Water is such an existential matter in Singapore: we have to live and breathe it all the time,” says Harvey Neo, a senior fellow and program head at the Lee Kuan Yew Centre for Innovative Cities at Singapore University of Technology and Design.\n\nYet the country has risen to the challenge. With integrated, long-term planning – and constant modification and improvement – the ambitious, prosperous city-state has become a model for effective urban water management. The city-state’s high level of governmental control might sometimes spark international incredulity – for instance, for the notoriously well-enforced laws against chewing gum, litter and jaywalking – but it comes in handy for dealing with scarce resources. “It’s a very enlightened place,” says Cecilia Tortajada, a professor in environmental innovation at the University of Glasgow who specializes in water management and has been following developments in Singapore for the past 15 years.\n\nWhile acknowledging the important comparative advantage offered by the city-state’s high annual rainfall, she says that what sets Singapore apart from other places facing similar challenges is the genuine, high-level coordination and collaboration between resource management sectors. “Every country’s ideal is coordination, but it doesn’t happen in most places. It does, however, happen in Singapore. There are clear decision-making processes for land use, and they play out according to the plans.”\n\nThe four ‘national taps’\n\nAccording to Singapore’s Public Utilities Board (PUB), which coordinates the supply of electricity, water and piped gas, the country has four National Taps, or water sources: rainwater, imported water from Malaysia, high-grade reclaimed water termed ‘NEWater,’ and desalinated water.\n\nAt present, imported water from the Johor River in Malaysia represents up to half of Singapore’s total water usage. But policymakers in Malaysia are increasingly reluctant to maintain this situation, and Singapore’s rights to draw the water will end in 2061. So, PUB is working to level up inputs from the other “taps” before that occurs. “For a long time, water sourcing was not a huge issue, because we were simply buying a lot of it from Malaysia,” says Neo. “And we’ve always relied on that relationship. But the federal politics of Malaysia have changed, and we’ve had to think more about other solutions.”\n\nTwo-thirds of the country’s land area is put to work as a catchment for rainwater, and PUB, according to its website, continues to strive toward the goal of “collecting every drop of water that falls on Singapore.” That means making use of the likes of roofs of high-rise buildings and run-off from airport runways for rainwater harvest. Between 28 and 33 percent of all water used at the country’s Changi Airport, for instance, is rainwater that’s captured and treated onsite, saving the airport an estimated USD 275,000 per year.\n\nNEWater is created by collecting and carefully treating the country’s sewage and wastewater for reuse. NEWater currently supplies around 30 percent of total water demand, and PUB aims to up this to 55 percent. Tortajada points out that such a system could only be effective in a place where trust in government is high, as it is in Singapore. “If you ask people there whether they trust the recycled wastewater, they look at you like, ‘of course!’” she says. “So [PUB] is trusted to that point.” Neo confesses he personally feels “a little bit iffy about [using recycled sewage and wastewater], but we have no say over this – it’s in the water supply whether we like it or not.”\n\nDesalination, the final National Tap, supplies about a quarter of total water demand through its four active desalination plants, and PUB hopes to up this to 30 percent by 2060. Conventional desalination processes, however, are highly energy-intensive, so the institution is working on ways to make them more efficient, such as through electro-deionization (using an electrical field to pull dissolved salts through water) and biomimicry (mimicking the low-energy processes by which mangrove plants extract freshwater from seawater).\n\nWater-wise infrastructure and population\n\nMacRitchie Reservoir is Singapore’s oldest reservoir and first water supply system. PaVan, Flickr\n\nIn 2000, Singapore’s water consumption was 165 liters per person per day. In 2018, it had dropped to 141 liters. PUB hopes to get it down to 130 liters by 2030.\n\nConsciously saving water – through legislation, design, incentives and education – has been central Singapore’s management strategy. Only highly water-efficient domestic appliances (such as washing machines, showers and dishwashers) can be sold in the country. In public housing complexes, where almost 80 percent of Singapore’s residents reside, the pipes installed in kitchens and bathrooms are narrower than those used in countries such as the U.S., which also cuts water use considerably. Technologies like motion sensor taps stem wastage even further.\n\nOutside the home, city planners carefully control water-hungry land uses. “For instance, we used to have a lot more golf courses,” says Neo. “But those require quite a bit of water, so in recent years we haven’t renewed the leases for most of them.”\n\nPricing water – at levels that people in other countries would likely consider very high – is another key part of the strategy. “It’s not just a retrieval cost,” says Neo. “It’s a kind of existential cost as well. So it’s punitive… The more water you use compared to households of a similar size, the more you will be taxed.”\n\nWater conservation education, which has been in places for decades, is also a critical part of the equation. “Singapore is a bit different in terms of how strongly people hold this idea of the importance of water, its value and how it’s a precious commodity,” says Neo. “It’s been inculcated into us from a young age – from when we were 4 years old at kindergarten and right the way through the school system. Even back when I was young, it was not like we just took a course on water: it was sprinkled through all of our learning.”\n\nAdaptation and innovation\n\nOver the past years, Singapore has diversified and modernized its water supply systems to increase its self-dependency. Mike Enerio, Unsplash\n\nA key strength of Singapore’s system is that it’s very responsive to feedback, says Tortajada. “When [the government] gets things wrong, they change them very quickly,” she says. “And it’s unlikely that, in Singapore, they will be wrong on something more than two times.”\n\nThis constant innovation will likely prove even more important in the coming decades, given the growing uncertainty of weather patterns as the climate changes. However, Neo is optimistic about the resilience of the current approach. “We’ve tried a lot of things, and we’ve now reached a sort of status quo in terms of our management of water,” he says. “And I think that it probably will continue to work going forward – we’ve devised a very comprehensive management, harvesting and water-use system that I think we can depend on for the near future.”\n\nThis article is part of a series on cities and water management.

    "The Big Read: Amid intensifying global talent war, Singapore faces juggling act in hunt for world's best and brightest": "Ethos BeathChapman's Mr Kochar pointed out that \"when it comes to starting something new that has not been done before by the firm, it cannot be done by just one top executive\".\n\nHe said: \"They would need their own ‘army’, if not 100 per cent at least 20 or 30 per cent (of a team).\"\n\nBut he added: \"(The rollout of) ONE Pass is also about saying … we have a working army, now we’re getting a leader to lead the army.”\n\nIMPLICATIONS OF WOOING ELITE GLOBAL TALENTS\n\nEarlier this month, Dr Tan said in Parliament that as part of Singapore's global talent \"offensive\", agencies such as the National Arts Council and Ministry of Education will help identify not just high-earners but \"exceptional talent\" in fields such as the arts, sports and science,\n\nThese high-achievers will not need to meet the S$30,000 monthly salary criterion for ONE Pass, and will help push Singapore to “new frontiers, draw in greater investments … (and) create a very diverse range of opportunities for Singaporeans”, said the Manpower Minister.\n\nMr Song of CIMB bank said this signals Singapore’s effort to support the growth of non-business fields, given that their top talents will be accorded similar treatment with business leaders in terms of work passes.\n\nHowever, there are concerns from some of those interviewed about potential side effects of Singapore's targeted strategy of going after top-tier talents, be in business or other fields.\n\n“I would argue that by setting it up as some sort of ‘platinum card’ may cause envy and resentment down the line,” said Mr Black of Blackbox.\n\n“Even if the numbers accepted are relatively small, talented (locals) may feel, rightly or wrongly, that such a scheme means they will be overlooked for top jobs in favour of a foreigner,” he said.\n\nMr Black's views were echoed by sociologists interviewed.\n\nAssociate Professor Laavanya Kathiravelu at Nanyang Technological University’s (NTU) School of Social Sciences said that the ONE Pass initiative may inadvertently \"be seen as creating a two-tiered workforce, even among foreign skilled professionals working here\".\n\nShe also expressed concern that it may lead to a situation where a company would lean towards parachuting readily available top talents from elsewhere to take up apex roles, instead of investing time and resources in training Singaporeans to move up the ladder.\n\nDr Rebecca Grace Tan from National University of Singapore’s (NUS) College of Humanities and Sciences said that while the ONE Pass is currently “quite restrictive” in terms of qualification criteria and validity period, “it is not clear that the incentives for foreigners will stop here”, as Singapore continues to be in a “global talent arms race”.\n\n“This is especially so given the hypermobility of the super-rich. For example, James Dyson moved to Singapore in 2019 and returned back to the United Kingdom in 2021,” she said.\n\n“Instead, we are likely to see more and more incentives rolled out to attract and retain foreign talent, much like what we saw in Europe which accumulated in the provision of permanent residency based on how much migrants invested.\"\n\nQuestions on ensuring skills transfer have also been raised in Parliament, with MP Jamus Lim (WP-Sengkang) asking if such training requirements can be codified into law, while other MPs suggested time-limited EPs to ensure skills transfer.\n\nIn response, Dr Tan cautioned “against too deterministic an approach” as skills transfer is not a simple or linear process.\n\nOver the years, government leaders have repeatedly stressed that developing local talents remains a priority, even as it taps on the global skilled workforce to help drive the economy.\n\nMost recently, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong reiterated that investing heavily in human capital locally “has and will continue to be a cornerstone\" of the Government's development strategy.\n\nMr Wong, who is also the Finance Minister, was speaking last week at the launch of the financial services sector's second industry transformation map. At the launch, it was also announced that S$400 million has been committed to developing local professionals as part of the sector's five-year blueprint.\n\nMeanwhile, a constant bugbear when it comes to discussing the presence of foreign talents here is the concern over housing and rental prices.\n\nProperty analysts cautioned that the push to attract global talents, especially the top tier ones, would drive up demand for housing in Singapore.\n\nMs Christine Sun, senior vice president of research and analytics at OrangeTee & Tie, expects the rental market to feel the impact first, “especially for the luxury segment given (the top global talents') high salaries and expat packages”.\n\nAgreeing, Mr Lee Sze Teck, senior director for research at Huttons Asia, said that rentals for other market segments will probably rise as well, albeit to a lesser degree than luxury homes.\n\nMr Nicholas Mak, head of research and consultancy at ERA, said it might be too early to talk about the impact of the ONE Pass initiative on the property market. Nevertheless, he noted that foreign buyers “are already active in buying and selling high-end residential properties”.\n\n\n\nMr Mohan Sandrasegeran, senior analyst for research and content creation at One Global Group, cited official data which showed that 180 new homes were bought by foreigners in the second quarter of this year. “This was the highest number of units purchased by foreigners since the third quarter of 2019, when there were a total of 182 units transacted,” he added.",
    "Google wants to help Singapore firms tap data, AI responsibly": "Google wants to provide Singapore organisations with the cloud tools and skills they need to tap data for greater efficiencies and better service delivery. It also hopes to help them leverage artificial intelligence (AI) and to do so responsibly, based on its own set of best practices and principles.\n\nWith organisations worldwide digitally transforming their business, including those in Singapore and Malaysia, the US cloud vendor is keen to figure out how its technology and infrastructure can facilitate their efforts.\n\nData, specifically, will prove critical in enabling companies to tap new opportunities in a digital economy, said Google Cloud's Singapore and Malaysia country director, Sherie Ng, in an interview with ZDNET.\n\nShe said businesses would need to figure out how to leverage data to better understand and serve customers as well as to reduce inefficiencies and improve work processes. The ability to generate insights from the right data also would be essential for companies to not only birth new businesses and products and services, but also identify ways to measure and reduce their energy consumption and costs, Ng said.\n\nThis meant building digital infrastructures that were global in scale and able to support real-time access to data, she noted. She added that organisations in some markets such as Singapore now were looking to gain more value from their cloud adoption as they moved up the model.\n\n\"They're interested not just in moving workloads to the cloud. We're seeing customers that want to be truly cloud-native,\" she said. These organisations were building their DevOps teams and deploying cloud-native technologies, such as containers and Kubernetes, Ng added.\n\nIn doing so, however, they faced challenges in finding the right talent and skillsets to help them transform into cloud-native environments, she said. This was an area Google hoped to address through schemes such as the Skills Ignition SG training programme, which was introduced in 2020, and developer hubs for startups, she noted.\n\nGoogle also aimed to offer the technology that could establish the transparency businesses needed, for instance, in measuring their carbon footprint, she said, adding that an organisation's entire ecosystem should be sustainable, including its core infrastructure and supply chain.\n\nNg, who took on her current role in December 2021 from Microsoft where she was public sector general manager, said her top priority for the next couple of years was to enable companies in the two Asian markets to transform not just digitally, but also to do so on a green and sustainable foundation.\n\nIn Singapore, this encompassed working with the government on AI research and competency building, where Google would offer training resources and certification schemes to build proficiencies in AI and machine learning amongst local public-sector officers.\n\nIn addition, the cloud vendor would support the government's initiatives in driving AI governance and ethics in sectors such as finance. Google had contributed to Singapore's Model AI Governance Framework and self-assessment guide for businesses, and sat on the country's Advisory Council of the Ethical Use of AI.\n\nNg noted that AI was an important technology, but needed effective regulation to ensure it was used for good. Echoing the Singapore government's call for \"guard rails\", she said these were necessary to instil responsible use of AI.\n\n\"And there will be conversations about what works for Singapore as a country...every country will have its nuances,\" she said, adding that Google was keen to share its own AI best practices and principles that it had adopted globally. Data that it uses, for instance, must be inclusive to mitigate the risk of bias. Humans also are involved in final decisions to establish accountability.\n\nGoogle itself had to deal with some controversy involving its ethical AI unit, when it fired a team member last year due to--the company said--violations of its code of conduct and security policies. Reports suggested the move was related to another researcher's departure over her criticism Google was \"silencing marginalised voices\" and she had co-authored a research paper urging tech giants to ensure AI language systems did not promote gender bias.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE",

    "In a Complete Reversal, Singapore Foundation Apologizes for Seeking Court Order to Block KAWS Exhibition": "Ending a months-long legal battle, the Ryan Foundation in Singapore, which threatened to shut down a traveling public art show by KAWS in the Asian city state, has apologized for the “embarrassment and/or distress” inflicted on the exhibition’s organizers, Hong Kong agency AllRightsReserved (ARR), as part of an out-of-court settlement.\n\nThe drama started last November, when the foundation’s directors—Ryan Su, a lawyer and art collector in Singapore, and Adrian Chan—obtained an interim injunction against ARR to block “KAWS: Holiday Singapore,” from opening at The Float at Marina Bay. The wildly popular free show featured a 140-foot inflatable Companion sculpture by the famed Brooklyn-based artist Brian Donnelly, also known as KAWS.\n\nThe non-profit claimed it was involved in the initial planning for the show, and accusing ARR of breaching its intellectual property rights and misusing confidential information. In addition to stopping the exhibition, the injunction also hit pause on the sale and distribution of related merchandise, as well as promotional activities.\n\nBut now, in a letter obtained by Artnet News, Su and Chan now say the allegations they made against ARR, including the misuse of confidential information and copyright infringement, were incorrect.\n\n“ARR had the right to organize and conduct the Exhibition in Singapore,” the statement read. “We apologise for any embarrassment and/or distress that the Allegations have caused to ARR and its officers.”\n\nThe apology comes months after the courts sided with ARR, which has been organizing the “Holiday” world tour since 2018 in Seoul. Two days after issuing the injunction, the court reversed it after hearing arguments from ARR’s legal team, and the show was back on track on November 15. The court also ordered the Ryan Foundation to pay the Hong Kong agency’s legal costs.\n\nBut the foundation did not back down, vowing to proceed with a full trial. The legal disputes between the Ryan Foundation and ARR continued to escalate, with ARR countersuing the foundation and its directors for defamation. A settlement was finally reached during a mediation that took place on September 21—exactly 10 months after the Singapore exhibition concluded. As part of the deal, ARR has dropped its defamation charges against the foundation.\n\n“We would like to thank our long-time collaborator, acclaimed contemporary artist KAWS, partners and friends who have remained steadfast in their support of us throughout,” ARR said in a statement. “We are overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and colossal support for the Exhibition from the most affectionate Singaporeans. We hope to return to the city and meet you all very soon.”\n\nBeyond the public apology, no further details, including whether the Ryan Foundation will still have to pay ARR’s legal costs, have been disclosed.\n\nFollow Artnet News on Facebook:",
    "Williams F1 decision on Nyck De Vries Singapore drive | thejudge13": "The Williams Formula One team have provisionally decided to give Nyck de Vries a second F1 drive in Singapore. In the period since Alex Albon posted his twitter update 10 days ago revealing he was taking his first steps after his appendectomy, the team Albon and De Vries have been silent over whether the British-Thai driver will be fit enough to drive in Singapore this weekend.\n\nThe Singapore circuit is one of the most physical tests the F1 drivers face each season as Albon revealed in his tweet.\n\n“The goal is to be ready for Singapore, which is going to be tough.”\n\n“Its one of the toughest races that we go to. Its not an easy one but lets aim high and see what happens.”\n\nThe physicality the drivers face this year at the Asian circuit will be tougher than ever due to the new F1 car design regulations. The new cars now use aerodynamic under the floor ground effect to create downforce which has seen some teams run their cars lower than before to the track surface\n\nSingapore F1 circuit similar to Baku\n\nThe track surface is similar in nature to Baku and so the effect of the bumps will be greater than ever at the Marina Bay track.\n\nLewis Hamilton struggled to get out of his car following the Baku race and despite the FIA issuing at technical directive to reduce the vertical oscillations facade by the driers since Azerbaijan, the modified cars have not really faced a proper test of how much better the ride is.\n\nIt could be even though they have been modified, they react in a similar fashion to the way the handled in Baku.\n\nWilliams F1 hand forced\n\nWilliams have been forced to make an early decision on Albon because if Nyck De Vries were to substitute for him again, he will need all the track time available to him starting with FP1.\n\nJust waiting to see how Albon gets on in FP1 was not really an option if the team wish to maximise their potential in the GP.\n\nSingapore4 is a real opportunity for the Williams car which was much better suited than others to the Baku race surface, with Albon finishing P12 and Latifi P15.\n\nThe team have not yet formally announced De Vries as Albon’s substitute because the young Dutchman himself needed to get fitter since Monza.\n\nDe Vries not F1 fit\n\nFollowing. The chequered flag last time out in Italy, De Vries reported over team radio, “My shoulders are dead. I’m struggling to even…Can someone help me or am I alone in Parc Ferme? I can literally not even lift my arms anymore.”\n\nAlpha Tauri’s Pierre Gasly came to over to check. On him.\n\nF1 drivers regularly face G-Forces of 5g when braking, 2g under acceleration and up to 6g when cornering. They also lose up to 3kg in weight during some races and by comparison Monza with its long straights is benign when compared to the up coming street circuit in Singapore.\n\nAlbon would have stood no chance of returning to the car had the original race calendar stood, because the Russian GP was originally slated in the intervening days following his surgery.\n\nAlex innate level of fitness will not have dropped, but concerns over the bumpy nature of the Singapore track and whether his wound could be reopened will have surely affected Williams decision on substituting him with Nyck de Vries.\n\nNyck’s preparation for Singapore hampered\n\nEven with the extra physical training the young Dutchman has had his preparations for Singapore hampered because of new travel laws from Europe to the UK.\n\nNyck took to instagram saying he had been unable to travel to the Williams factory in Grove because he only had his EU ID card and not his passport. He returned home until the matter was revolved.\n\nAs much as F1 fans appear to support Alex Allbon after his traumas racing for Red Bull, there will be many excited to see what F1’s next big thing has to offer at one of the most demanding circuits on the Formula One calendar.\n\nREAD MORE: Haas F1 criticise Mick Schumacher’s attitude",

    "Singapore: New Code of Practice details Chief Executive, Director Workplace Safety and Health Statutory Duties": "The Code details the organisational systems and culture to be implemented by directors of all companies to show full compliance with the Workplace Safety and Health Act 2006.\n\nIn brief\n\nThe Code of Practice: Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' Workplace Safety and Health Duties (\"Code\") will, when gazetted in October 2022, apply to all directors and equivalent officers involved in policy making and executive decisions for business affairs of companies in all industries, even for companies which have no manual work and little risk of physical injury.\n\nWhile this Code is not mandatory, MOM will consider directors who adopt its principles and measures to have taken reasonably practicable measures to uphold their workers' safety and health. In prosecutions for offences under the existing Workplace Safety and Health Act 2006 (WSHA 2006), directors may show proof of compliance with the Code as a mitigating factor for the court's consideration.\n\nWe provide below the background to this Code and a summary of the four principles and the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) measures as to management conduct and policy making, diligence, disclosure and reporting, budget, and dedicated staffing to be adopted by individual directors on a continuing basis.\n\nBackground\n\nMOM has expressed extreme concern over the increase in workplace fatalities since the start of 2022, as compared to the whole of 2021 and in 2019 pre-COVID. Together with tripartite partners and industry stakeholders, MOM has taken the following steps to hold employers to higher WSH standards in an effort to reduce workplace the fatal injury rate to less than 1 per 100,000 workers by 2028:\n\nThe courts have also introduced a new sentencing framework with harsher penalties against employers that fail to ensure the health and safety of employees at work under the WSHA 2006; see our alert: Recent High Court decisions on employer liability for workplace safety offences and compensation for workplace injuries.\n\nHowever, MOM recognises that the inculcation of a safety culture, which underpins safe workplaces, must start with the senior management, who:\n\nSet the culture and allocate the resources within their organisations\n\nUltimately shape WSH practices throughout the company\n\nMOM earlier ran a public consultation on the proposed Approved Code of Practice (ACOP) on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties, and expedited the ACOP from Q1 2023 to Q4 2022. On conclusion of the public consultation and industry engagements on 8 September 2022, MOM and WSH Council have reviewed the feedback received and will gazette and bring into effect the finalised document by October 2022.\n\nThe law already places WSH responsibilities on company leadership, with section 48(1) of the WSHA 2006 obliging all officers of a company, including directors, to:\n\nEnsure their workers' safety and health\n\nProve they had exercised due diligence to prevent workplace incidents\n\nThe Code outlines the desired outcomes in organisational systems and culture that directors should seek to achieve in order to comply with section 48(1), and while directors should assess the relevance of the measures cited in the Code to their organisations, including industry type and nature of exposure to risks and hazards, the directors nonethless adopt and adapt the recommended practices that best suit the nature of work in their sector and organisation.\n\nUnder the following four principles:\n\nIntegrate WSH into business decisions and ensure clarity in directors' roles and responsibilities in leading WSH\n\nContinuously build a strong WSH culture, set the tone and demonstrate visible leadership in embodying and communicating highly effective workplace safety and health standards\n\nEnsure WSH management systems are effective and reviewed regularly\n\nEmpower workers to be actively engaged in WSH\n\nthe Code lists reasonably practicable steps that directors can take to realise the desired organisational WSH systems and culture.\n\nWe summarise these measures below:",

UK-Singapore trade is already worth over £17bn per year.\n\nTech Nation, the UK’s leading growth platform for tech companies, is co-leading this week by organising a delegation and creating a programme of 90 meetings with corporate partners and investors.\n\nLawtech: a bright spot for future growth\n\nTen lawtech companies are visiting Singapore from the UK to explore business opportunities in Asia Pacific.\n\n‘Lawtech’ is commonly used to describe technologies that support, supplement or replace traditional methods for the delivery of legal services or legal transactions by law practice entities or lawyers.\n\nThe UK-Singapore Digital Economy Agreement is the first trade agreement in the world to contain specific commitments on lawtech. The UK’s lawtech sector is valued at £11.4bn, according to Tech Nation research. The UK has the largest legal services market in Europe – and is second globally only to the US.\n\nThe DEA brings together two leading nations on legal services, and will help firms identify collaboration opportunities in both markets more easily.\n\nIt has specific provisions that promote electronic contracts and signatures; secure international data flows; and ensure protection of key proprietary information.\n\nThe DEA gives businesses greater confidence and assurance about the rules of the road when it comes to trading digitally between the UK and Singapore, both now and in the future.\n\nKara Owen, British High Commissioner to Singapore said:\n\nI am excited to host 24 UK tech companies at the British High Commission, Singapore.

    "Singapore risks gentrification if public housing left to market forces: Desmond Lee": "SINGAPORE: Singapore risks gentrification and stratification if it leaves public housing to market forces, said Minister for National Development Desmond Lee on Sunday (Sep 25).\n\nSuch issues are visible in successful cities around the world, as \"invisible but powerful socioeconomic forces\" segregate where people live according to their means, he added.\n\nTo prevent this from happening in Singapore, the Prime Location Public Housing (PLH) model was launched last year to build Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats in central locations - so that these areas \"do not become exclusive neighbourhoods that only the well-to-do can enjoy in private housing\", said Mr Lee.\n\nUnder the PLH model, selected Build-to-Order (BTO) flats in prime locations will come with extra subsidies, but those who later sell their units have to pay HDB a percentage of the resale price.\n\nA 10-year minimum occupation period - double that of typical projects - also applies before owners can sell their flats.",
    "Hafnia taps F-drones for deliveries in Singapore": "Singapore shipowner Hafnia has entered into an agreement with compatriot autonomous drone startup F-drones to use drones for deliveries to its Singapore-based vessels.\n\nThe Oslo-listed product tanker unit of BW Group said the move would enable the company to rely less on the use of boats to deliver smaller loads to vessels and thereby reduce CO2 emissions with every trip.\n\nHafnia carried out a successful test of using drones to deliver small payloads to its vessels in Singapore in June 2020. Further tests were conducted in 2022 with F-drones with a higher range, leading to an official deal for drone deliveries to vessels anchored in Singapore “depending on the right circumstances”.\n\nSingapore has been trialing drone deliveries for quite some time. In 2020, F-drones was the first company in Singapore to receive authorisation from the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore to conduct beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) drone deliveries to ships in Singapore, with Eastern Pacific Shipping as its first paying customer. The company in March teamed up with fellow offshore vessel owner and operator Marco Polo Marine to co-develop what are claimed to be the world’s first large-scale, electric aerial delivery drones for offshore wind farms.\n\nAlso earlier this year, Singapore’s sole multipurpose port, Jurong, joined forces with advanced air mobility (AAM) infrastructure developer and drone operator Skyports to explore the development of ship-to-shore infrastructure.",
    "Second bite of the cherry in England after divorce litigation in Singapore?": "Part III of the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984 (“Part III”) permits further financial provision to be made by the English Court after divorce and financial orders have been made overseas. In this important and developing area of English family law, the cases of Hasan v Ul Hasan (Deceased) Anor [2021] EWHC 1791 (Fam) and Potanina v Potanin 2021 EWCA Civ 702 have both received permission to appeal to the Supreme Court on different aspects of Part III and are expected to be heard this autumn.\n\nIn Vew v Vev [2022] SGCA 34 the Court of Appeal in Singapore had to decide whether to continue an anti-suit injunction (“ASI”) in favour of the husband, which would prevent his former wife from bringing a Part III claim in England following their earlier divorce in Singapore. Within the Singapore divorce proceedings, the court had excluded a valuable property in London in the husband’s sole name, deciding that it did not fall into the pool of matrimonial assets. It was against this property that the wife made her Part III claim, relying on the provision in Part III which gives the English court jurisdiction over a dwelling-house which was, at some time during the marriage, a matrimonial home. The husband obtained an ASI at first instance in Singapore to prevent her from pursuing this claim on grounds she would be re-litigating an issue which had already been determined by the court in Singapore, taking a “second bite of the cherry” after the Singapore court had excluded the property from any matrimonial claims, and such litigation would be vexatious and oppressive.\n\nThe wife succeeded in having the ASI lifted to enable her to pursue her claim in England. The Court of Appeal in Singapore took the view that there had been no re-litigation as the Part III claim only concerned an asset which was not included, or divided, in the Singapore divorce proceedings and, for reasons of international comity, it should not interfere with the Part III process in England.\n\nThe Singapore Court of Appeal acknowledged that Chapter 4A of the Women’s Charter (2009) (“the Women’s Charter”) was modelled on Part III by the Singapore legislature; the purpose of both being to provide further financial provision where no, or no adequate, provision had been made for a spouse in overseas divorce proceedings. In England, this followed a Law Commission Report in 1982 which highlighted the potential unfairness, particularly to women and children, given the liberality of recognition in England of divorce orders made overseas, which then prevented the English Court from making financial provision orders on divorce. The same issue that led to the enactment of Part III was also recognised in Singapore around the 1990s and, in 2009, the Singapore Law Reform Committee recommended amending the Women’s Charter to plug this particular lacuna in Singapore family law.",

    "Opinion | I Have Worked, Played and Loved in Other Countries Because I Can’t at Home": "The idea of reducing that children’s book and its gentle cartoon penguins to pulp felt deeply personal, a reminder of how vulnerable we are to the cruel impulses of our fellow citizens.\n\nSingapore wasn’t always so suffocating.\n\nThe city’s Bugis Street nightlife district was notorious in the 1950s and 1960s for the foreign visitors who cavorted with transgender prostitutes and attended bawdy cabarets. Most other expressions of queer desire were relegated to dark alleys and toilets, but law enforcement largely left people alone.\n\nBut in the 1980s and 1990s, the state began actively policing homosexuality. Police lured gay men with handsome undercover officers and arrested them. Twelve men were arrested in a raid in 1993 and sentenced to jail time and strokes by the rattan cane.\n\nThis has stopped, but that virulent homophobia lingers in our psyche. In the mid-2000s, I was active on a gay forum called SGBOY, where teenagers like me would flirt and gossip. One day, a private message from a stranger in his 40s warned me: “Be careful. It’s not safe to be so ‘out.’”\n\nThat seemed melodramatic. Only much later, when I learned about previous police raids, did I understand his message of care and wisdom. I often think about this man. Had he only ever known desire in the context of shame and danger? Had he lost friends, seen lovers brutalized?\n\nSingapore queers today are heirs to his shame, especially those who still hide their faces on apps, who don’t meet my eyes when we hook up for sex. Many couples are still anxious about public displays of affection even after years of being together.",
    "Commentary: Why are Singapore travellers so enamoured with Japan?": "SINGAPORE: Japan-mania is at an all-time high in Singapore, now that the country has finally lifted COVID-19 restrictions on foreign tourists.\n\nThere is no doubt Japan is a beloved holiday destination among Singaporeans. From the exciting buzz of cities like Tokyo and Osaka, to skiing and snowboarding in the powdery snow of Niseko and savouring contemplative moments in Kyoto’s temples, there are so many ways to enjoy the land of the rising sun.\n\nSo after more than two years of border closures and tight travel restrictions, no prizes for guessing which country holiday-goers have on top of their post-pandemic bucket list.\n\nAccording to the 2022 ISEAS State of Southeast Asia survey, Japan is the most preferred country to visit among Singapore respondents, with almost a third of them choosing it. A separate survey by YouGov yielded similar results, with 49 per cent considering Japan as their next travel destination.\n\nTHE FLOODGATES ARE OPEN\n\nSince Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced Japan will relax border control measures and resume visa-free and individual travel in October, my social media feeds have been flooded with posts from excited friends.\n\nMany are tagging their fellow travel buddies in an “open call” to start planning a trip. Others who had the foresight to book their air tickets months in advance are busy humble-bragging about their wanderlust-inducing itineraries in Japan.\n\nAfter a drawn-out pandemic spent languishing and dreaming about travel, it is wonderful to see so many people deriving joy not just in holiday planning, but in living vicariously through their friends and loved ones doing the same.",
    "Singapore FM asks to uphold multilateral system amid unprecedented challenges": "Singaporean Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan speaks during the General Debate of the 77th session of the UN General Assembly at the UN headquarters in New York, on Sept. 24, 2022. (Cia Pak/UN Photo/Handout via Xinhua)\n\nUNITED NATIONS, Sept. 24 (Xinhua) -- Singaporean Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan on Saturday stressed the importance of upholding the inclusive and rules-based multilateral system amid multiple challenges.\n\n\"The post-World War II era of relative stability and prosperity has, in fact, unfortunately, come to an end,\" he told the General Debate of the UN General Assembly.\n\n\"Will we have a more divided, less prosperous, and less peaceful world? Or, can we strengthen multilateralism and the United Nations to deal with the challenges of the future, to uphold and strengthen the rules-based international system, and to jointly harness the opportunities offered by new technologies?\" he asked.\n\n\"Singapore believes that the only way forward is to uphold the inclusive and rules-based multilateral system that has underwritten peace and progress for all of us since World War II,\" said Balakrishnan.\n\nThe experience of fighting the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that \"multilateral cooperation is the only way forward,\" he said, adding that humanity shares one planet, and people's destinies are interwoven.\n\n\"No one is safe until all of us are safe. This applies to pandemics, but also to climate change, the conservation of the oceans, and many other shared challenges,\" he said.\n\nThe multilateral system, which has contributed greatly to global peace and security, is now being severely tested. The prospects for international cooperation have weakened considerably and the temptation for unilateralism has become even stronger, he warned.\n\nRecovery from COVID-19 remains uneven and fragile, the global economy is entering a period characterized by higher and prolonged inflation, and the climate crisis is a clear and present threat, the diplomat noted.\n\nThis is a moment when multilateralism must be defended and fortified, said Balakrishnan, noting that responses to these myriad opportunities and challenges must remain rooted in the foundational tenet of multilateralism, including especially adherence to the UN Charter and international law.\n\n\"It is in the world's interests -- and in our own long-term interests -- to set aside our differences, to address the challenges of the global commons, and to harvest the emerging opportunities provided by new technologies,\" Balakrishnan added. ■",
    "Ocon: 2022 F1 cars like ‘go karts on kerbs’ in Singapore": "Listen to this article\n\nThe new cars have been already proved to be tricky at similar temporary venues such as Montreal and Baku earlier this season.\n\nWhile bouncing has to some degree been dialled out at recent events, it is expected to be more prominent once again in Singapore, which F1 will visit next weekend for the first time since 2019.\n\n\"It's going to be very bumpy,” said Ocon. “A big challenge I think for us, very physical. I love Singapore. But the track itself is not my favourite. They are go-karts on kerbs, it's going to be a tricky one.\n\n\"It's not going to be fun. But we're up for the challenge. And I think it's going to be interesting also to see who chooses what, in terms of set-up. If you go for the car that rides well, or the car that has grip.\"\n\nAsked if it might be the worst track of year, he said: \"I think Canada has been pretty bad. But probably it will be one of the worst ones. It always is, it's not news.\"\n\nGeorge Russell, Mercedes W13 Photo by: Mark Sutton / Motorsport Images\n\nMercedes believes that Singapore track will be more suited to the W13 than other recent venues, but George Russell acknowledged that the bumpy layout could be an issue for the team.\n\n“I think, on paper, Singapore should suit our car,” said Russell. “But when we look back at the street circuits of Monaco and Azerbaijan, our car doesn't fare too well over the bumps.\n\n“So, we're not too sure how it will fall out. But we need to keep on pushing, keep on improving the car and I'm pleased that we've got a clear direction we need to go now.”\n\nMercedes technical director Mike Elliott agreed that Singapore should be good for the W13.\n\n“I think when you look back at the learning we have gathered over the season I think we expect that Singapore will be a bit more like we’ve seen in Budapest and Zandvoort,” he said.\n\n“It’s a bumpy circuit which is going to provide its challenges, but in terms of the nature of the corners we think it could be a bit better for our car. So, hopefully we will have a good result there.\n\n“As always with all the pre-simulation work we need to do, we will maximise our learning in the practice sessions and hopefully we turn that into a good result over the weekend.\"",
    "Experts of the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Commend Singapore on Ratifying the Marrakesh Treaty, Ask Questions on the Death Penalty and Access to Health Insurance": "The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities today concluded its consideration of the initial report of Singapore on its implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Committee Experts commended Singapore on ratifying the Marrakesh Treaty, among other measures to promote the rights of persons with disabilities, while asking questions on the use of the death penalty and access to health insurance.\n\nSaowalak Thongkuay, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, acknowledged various efforts to promote the human rights of persons with disabilities in Singapore, including the ratification of the Marrakesh Treaty.\n\nMarkus Schefer, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, said that the Convention prohibited the use of the death penalty against persons with psychosocial or intellectual disabilities. The Committee had appealed to the State party to not execute Nagaenthran K. Dharmalingam. Had Singapore considered abolishing the death penalty and imposing a moratorium on it until new rules came into effect?\n\nA Committee Expert said that discrimination was occurring regarding the provision of health and life insurance for persons with disabilities. What measures were in place to eliminate this discrimination, and to support persons with disabilities to access private health insurance?\n\nThe delegation said that there was no international consensus on the use of capital punishment, and each country had the sovereign right to determine whether it was implemented. Due regard was given to the mental state of the accused person. In the case of Mr. Dharmalingam, the High Court had found that he did not have an intellectual disability.\n\nSingapore had a multi-layer health financing scheme, and various subsidies ensured that all citizens had access to health care, the delegation said. All residents of Singapore were provided with 75 to 80 per cent coverage of hospital fees under State medical insurance. The Government intended to draft guidelines on the issuance of private health insurance to ensure access for persons with disabilities.\n\nEric Chua, Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Social and Family Development and Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth of Singapore and head of the delegation, presenting the report, said Singapore was committed to building an inclusive society where persons with disabilities were enabled to pursue their aspirations, achieve their potential, and participate as equal members of society. Efforts were guided by national roadmaps, the “enabling masterplans”. The Government consulted with more than 300 persons with disabilities, caregivers and representatives from disability organizations in developing these masterplans.\n\nIn concluding remarks, Mr. Chua said that Singapore was fully committed to removing barriers for persons with disabilities, and to building an inclusive society that allowed persons with disabilities to achieve their full potential.\n\nMr. Schefer, in concluding remarks, said that the State party had provided detailed explanations of its efforts in employment, healthcare, education and other areas. Great efforts were still required to fulfil the provisions of the Convention. Mr. Schefer called on the State party to guarantee the rights of persons with disabilities from the Convention’s perspective.\n\n\n\nThe delegation of Singapore consisted of representatives of the Ministry of Social and Family Development; Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth; Land Transport Authority; Ministry of Education; Ministry of Health; Ministry of Home Affairs; Ministry of Manpower; Building and Construction Authority; SGEnable; Attorney-General’s Chambers; Ministry of Law; and the Permanent Mission of Singapore to the United Nations Office at Geneva.\n\nThe Committee will issue its concluding observations on the report of Singapore at the end of its twenty-seventh session, which concludes on 9 September. Summaries of the public meetings of the Committee can be found here , while webcasts of the public meetings can be found here . The programme of work of the Committee’s twenty-seventh session and other documents related to the session can be found here .\n\nThe Committee will next meet in public on Friday, 9 September to close its twenty-seventh session.\n\nPresentation of Report\n\nERIC CHUA, Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Social and Family Development and Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth of Singapore and head of the delegation, said that Singapore was committed to building an inclusive society where persons with disabilities were enabled to pursue their aspirations, achieve their potential, and participate as equal members of society. Efforts were guided by national roadmaps, the “enabling masterplans”. The Government consulted with more than 300 persons with disabilities, caregivers and representatives from disability organizations in developing these masterplans. Disability considerations were mainstreamed into policy development. The Government supported the education, employment and independent living of persons with disabilities. It worked to eliminate barriers to participation across all segments of society. The latest masterplan featured 29 recommendations across various areas, and included quantitative indicators and targets for the first time.\n\nSince 2016, the Government had expanded early intervention services for preschool-aged children with developmental needs, and enhanced subsidies to keep fees affordable. It had substantially increased investment in early intervention services, spending almost double of what had been spent in 2018. It had amended the compulsory education act in 2016 to extend compulsory education to students with moderate-to-severe disabilities.\n\nIn 2021, the Government provided employers of Singaporeans with disabilities with wage offsets of up to 30 per cent of salaries. It supported about 6,400 employers who employed more than 9,700 Singaporeans with disabilities in 2021. The 2021 Jobs Growth Incentive introduced further wage offsets which supported more than 3,400 persons with disabilities during the pandemic. In 2020, a national accreditation framework recognising organizations for disability-inclusive employment was established.\n\nAll public buses were wheelchair-accessible, all train stations had wheelchair-accessible routes, and all bus interchanges and 98 per cent of bus stops were barrier-free. The Government regularly reviewed Singapore’s code on accessibility in the built environment, in consultation with persons with disabilities and disability organizations. Around 79 per cent of buildings that were open to public access and over 99 per cent of all other public spaces had achieved basic accessibility. Local networks had been established to identify and address remaining accessibility gaps in specific localities.\n\nThe Government had launched the “enabling academy” in May this year, a disability learning hub that promoted lifelong learning for persons with disabilities. It planned to enshrine anti-discrimination guidelines for employment into law, and would work with disability organizations to develop alternative employment models, such as micro-jobs, and increase the number of disability-inclusive employers.\n\nThe Government would design and implement alternative housing and care models to enable persons with disabilities to live in the community. It was also piloting “enabling services hubs” working to build inclusive neighbourhoods and bring disability services close to where persons with disabilities lived.\n\nTo drive disability awareness, the Government was conducting various awareness campaigns. In 2019, an award was established to recognise persons with disabilities who had made significant contributions to society.\n\nCHIA YONG YONG, Consultant on Disability Issues, Ministry of Social and Family Development, said that she was born with a type of muscular atrophy. In her third year as a lawyer, she fractured a leg, and some years later started using a wheelchair full-time. She was born in a Singapore that was very different from modern-day Singapore. In the 1960s, the country was fighting for survival after having gained independence, and had no resources except for its people. At the time, the Government focused on strengthening the economy, defence, healthcare, education, skills and standards of living. All public resources had to be conserved to ensure that people had food on the table and slept safely.\n\nHousing at the time was often overcrowded, unhygienic and inaccessible. In her childhood, Ms. Yong Yong lived with 20 other people. Everyone shared one inaccessible bathroom and toilet. School infrastructure was not accessible. Although Ms. Yong Yong was supported by her school, her sister experienced some bullying and exclusion. Public transport was inaccessible. Ms. Yong Yong’s father took her and her sister to medical appointments, school and subsequently work. Her mother took on various manual jobs to supplement family income.\n\nMs. Yong Yong said 2004 was a turning point for disability policy in Singapore. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had set out a vision of Singapore as an inclusive society for persons with disabilities. From that point, systematic policy change had dramatically altered the landscape for persons with disabilities. The first enabling masterplan was launched in 2007, and this year the fourth iteration was launched.\n\nToday, public pathways had ramps, and public transport was accessible. Healthcare was easily accessible and affordable. Staff at hospitals received training to render assistance where needed. Healthcare was subsidised and of very high standard. But more could be done. Employment continued to present challenges for many persons with disabilities. There was often a mismatch of expectations between employees and colleagues/employers, and job redesign remained a challenge. Ms. Yong Yong hoped that the employment landscape would eventually become disability-neutral. Singapore had done much by way of infrastructure and systems. But mindsets, attitudes and an opening of the heart and mind would take time and continual, collective effort.\n\nQuestions by Committee Experts\n\nSAOWALAK THONGKUAY, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, said that the Committee appreciated the State party’s strong commitment to promote human rights and the well-being of all persons with disabilities in Singapore. The Committee acknowledged various efforts to promote the human rights of persons with disabilities in Singapore, including the ratification of the Marrakesh Treaty. However, Singapore had not yet ratified the Optional Protocol, withdrawn reservations to the Convention, or adopted a legal framework to eliminate discrimination on the grounds of disabilities.\n\nSingaporean legislation did not have an official definition of disability. Social services for persons with disabilities were currently provided by social service agencies, which denied the meaningful participation of all persons with disabilities as rights holders. Persons with psychosocial disabilities continued to be excluded from mainstream public services and disability specific services. Singapore’s laws continued to promote a substitute decision-making regime, guardianship and involuntary hospitalisation, and forced treatment in psychiatric hospitals and general hospitals. The Committee was further concerned that women and girls with disabilities were subjected to charity and medical interventions.\n\nIn addition, persons with disabilities experienced significant economic inequities. Persons with intellectual disabilities and autism were confined at home and denied access to public services and the social protection scheme. The Steering Committee on Disability lacked decision making and monitoring authority. There was also a lack of appropriate individualised procedural accommodation for persons with disabilities in the legal system, particularly regarding the death penalty.\n\nWhat steps had the State party taken to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention and to withdraw reservations to articles 12 (4), 25 (e) and 29 (a) (iii); to develop comprehensive legislation tackling discrimination against persons with disabilities; and to review and develop a definition of disability aligned with Convention?\n\nMARKUS SCHEFER, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, said that the Convention’s goal was to guarantee effective protection for all human rights for persons with disabilities, including the right to life. The Convention prohibited the use of the death penalty against persons with psychosocial disabilities. The Committee had appealed to the State party not to execute Nagaenthran K. Dharmalingam, and to adopt procedural accommodations. Had Singapore considered abolishing the death penalty and imposing a moratorium on it until new rules came into effect?\n\nA Committee Expert said that the infectious diseases act and the railways act contained discriminatory provisions relating to persons with leprosy. Had measures been taken to reform these? What measures had been taken to prevent discrimination against all persons with disabilities? What measures were in place to increase cooperation with organizations of women and girls with disabilities, to prevent violence against women and girls with disabilities, and to provide reasonable accommodation for women with disabilities in the workplace? How many persons with psychosocial disabilities had been executed or faced death penalty charges?\n\nAnother Committee Expert said that Singapore had stated that it would maintain its reservations to article 12.4 of the Convention. This indicated that the State would not conform to the human rights model of discrimination. Would the State consider repealing this reservation? What measures were in place to ensure that the national strategy on autism was in line with the Convention? Various laws aimed to silence civil society, particularly those that cooperated with international organizations. What measures were in place to empower organizations of persons with disabilities to participate in political processes? What was the State party doing to combat discriminatory portrayals of persons with autism in the media?\n\nOne Committee Expert asked about plans to create an organization for persons with intellectual disabilities. How were organizations of persons with disabilities involved in awareness raising programmes? Were organizations of persons with disabilities involved in training about the Convention for public officials? Was information about the Convention available in accessible formats, including Easy-Read?\n\nA Committee Expert asked the delegation to explain how Singapore provided equal and effective protection against discrimination. How did discrimination mechanisms provide access to remedies for persons with disabilities? Persons with disabilities and representative organizations should be recognised as human rights defenders. How did Singapore uphold the rights to freedom of speech and assembly for these organizations?\n\nAnother Committee Expert asked how reasonable accommodation was provided for persons with disabilities at school and work. What initiatives were taken to promote a positive image for all persons with disabilities, and ensure that media depictions of persons with disabilities were in line with the social model of disability? How were organizations of persons with disabilities involved in designing and implementing awareness programmes?\n\nOne Committee Expert asked about steps taken to eliminate discrimination against women and girls with disabilities and protect them from violence and abuse. How would the State improve access for women and girls with disabilities to reproductive health programmes? What measures were in place to allow children with disabilities to express their views on matters affecting them? Did the State organise training for public officials on the social model of disability?\n\nA Committee Expert asked for information on mechanisms to ensure the best interests of the child in kindergartens and guardianship situations. What measures were in place to prevent corporal punishment?\n\nOne Committee Expert said that an accessibility fund had been established. What was the current state of this fund?\n\nResponses by the Delegation\n\nThe delegation said that Singapore had fully incorporated the principles of the Convention in domestic law, and so the State had no plans to incorporate the Convention in stand-alone domestic legislation. All persons with disabilities were equal before the law under the Constitution. The Constitution also protected against all forms of discrimination, and all persons who were allegedly affected by discrimination could bring their cases before the courts. The State was the first South East Asian country to incorporate the Marrakesh Treaty into law. It planned to introduce legislation that prevented discrimination in the workplace and unfair hiring practices.\n\nSingapore supported the principle of article 25 (e) of the Convention, and would hold public consultations regarding the withdrawal of this reservation. It would maintain its reservation to article 12 (4). A person was not deprived of their legal capacity simply based on an assessment that they lacked mental capacity. The Mental Capacity Act strived to preserve legal capacity for all persons, including those with high support needs. Several measures were in place to allow persons with disabilities to vote in elections. The State defended voting secrecy, however, and so would maintain its reservation to article 29 (a) (iii).\n\nGuidelines for fair employment practices had been established. The tripartite alliance for fair employment practices received complaints about workplace discrimination and provided avenues for redress. Workplace discrimination was not tolerated.\n\nThe enabling masterplan called for the development of employment models for persons with disabilities, housing models and other support mechanisms. The implementation of the plan could be monitored by organizations of persons with disabilities. An inter-ministerial committee assessed all agencies’ policies affecting persons with disabilities. Organizations of persons with disabilities were consistently consulted before major legislation was introduced. Various persons with disabilities were on the boards of policy committees. The Movement for Persons with Intellectual Disabilities promoted measures to support persons with intellectual disabilities.\n\nSchemes were in place to support the livelihoods of persons with disabilities and subsidise medical costs. Disability assessments ensured that persons who needed the most support received the most resources.\n\nThe accessibility fund assisted private building owners to make buildings accessible. The fund had so far supported the accessibility upgrading of 150 buildings. The Government had recently extended and enhanced this fund to allow for the construction of accessible toilets and nursing rooms.\n\nThe vulnerable adults act protected persons with disabilities from abuse. The act allowed for affected persons and their family members to apply for protective court orders.\n\nThere were various avenues where the views of children were consulted, including the National Youth Council. The Ministry of Education had consulted with children with disabilities on education policies, and made revisions based on consultations. Court-appointed councils were in place to assess the best interests of children in guardianship cases.\n\nPatients with leprosy did not face discrimination. The incidence of leprosy had declined sharply to less than two persons in 100,000 due to improvements in medical treatment. Persons with leprosy had access to artificial limbs. All children with disabilities had access to the healthcare system. Hospital institutions provided early assessments and physical and psychosocial care for children with disabilities.\n\nInternational law did not prohibit capital punishment. There was no international consensus on the use of capital punishment, and each country had the sovereign right to determine whether it was implemented. There was no inequality in enjoying the right to life in Singapore. An accused person in a capital offence case was able to access free legal aid. Due regard was given to the mental state of the accused person. In the case of Mr. Dharmalingam, the High Court had found that he did not have an intellectual disability. Inmates with mild intellectual health conditions received regular treatment. Inmates who needed serious treatment were referred to hospitals.\n\nThe Government had solicited the participation of organizations of persons with disabilities in awareness campaigns. In 2020, six million Singaporean dollars had been invested in informing businesses about the rights of persons with disabilities. The media and organizations of persons with disabilities had been briefed about the Convention, and Easy-Read, Braille and audio guidebooks on the Convention had been produced.\n\nGuidelines on portrayals of persons with disabilities in the media had been established. However, the intent of the guidelines may have not yet been realised, and the delegation welcomed the Committee’s recommendations in this regard.\n\nThe right to freedom of expression was not absolute. Individuals’ freedom of speech needed to be balanced with the need to ensure a peaceful society. Organizations of persons with disabilities were able to exercise their right to freedom of expression. Forums promoting self-advocacy had been held by an organization of persons with Down syndrome. There were laws which were used to counter falsehoods and which relied primarily on correction directions. Correction directions did not require the removal of the original statement and were not sanctions. It was only in the more serious cases that the falsehood may be taken down. As for laws dealing with foreign interference, the purpose was not to prevent all forms of foreign influence but only attempts of manipulation.\n\nLaw enforcement officials received training on managing persons with disabilities, and training was also provided for members of the judiciary on working with persons with disabilities.\n\nSingapore provided reasonable accommodation for children with disabilities in schools. It was compulsory for all children aged 6 to 15 to attend a Government-funded school. Most students with autism studied in mainstream schools. All teacher training programmes included information on supporting students with autism. The Government provided early intervention services to assist parents in supporting the development of their children. Clinical practice guidelines for children with autism were currently being revised to ensure that interventions and support were based on evidence.\n\nThe Government was raising awareness on gender-based violence and had developed legal protections and support mechanisms for victims. Perpetrators of family violence were required to undergo counselling. Enhanced punishments were given to persons who abused vulnerable persons. The Government collaborated with community partners to identify cases of domestic violence and train staff of victim support services. Victim support services provided counselling, temporary care and protection, and other interventions for victims.\n\nThe sexual and reproductive rights of women and girls with disabilities were protected by legislation. Sterilisation and termination of pregnancy could not be carried out without the permission of the person involved.\n\nSingapore’s approach was to put protection for persons with disabilities in various pieces of legislation. This approach led to Government agencies taking ownership of legislation that promoted specific rights of persons with disabilities. To address gaps, the inter-ministerial oversight committee’s role was crucial.\n\nQuestions by Committee Experts\n\nSAOWALAK THONGKUAY, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, asked about steps to abolish medical decision-making, proxy decision-making and guardianship regimes. What steps had been taken to ensure access to the legal system for persons with disabilities? Persons with psychosocial disabilities experienced harmful conditions in prisons. What steps had been taken to address these, and to end the practice of putting persons with psychosocial disabilities in solitary confinement in psychiatric hospitals? How would the Government ensure that the community-based support regime was harmonised with the Convention?\n\n\n\nMARKUS SCHEFER, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, said that, to ascertain the “abnormality of mind” in death penalty cases, the State party used a medical approach, which was to be discouraged. The Convention did not allow for any person with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities to be issued the death penalty.\n\nAlthough Singapore had an extended immigration programme geared towards attracting skilled entrepreneurs, access of persons with disabilities to the labour market was severely limited, and their level of unemployment was more than double that of other persons. What percentage of persons with disabilities had been accepted by the State party as immigrants?\n\nDid article 12 of the Constitution, which dealt with discrimination, apply to private entities? Did it prohibit indirect discrimination? There did not necessarily need to be stand-alone legislation on discrimination, but monitoring the coverage of various laws was extremely demanding.\n\nA Committee Expert asked about procedural accommodations for persons with disabilities facing the death penalty. What measures were in place to ensure that children with disabilities were not subjected to torture in institutions? What support services were provided for children with disabilities in institutions?\n\nAnother Committee Expert asked about the accessibility of redress mechanisms in courts. What rehabilitation services were available for offenders with disabilities? What support was provided by the State to enable persons with disabilities to live independently?\n\nOne Committee Expert said that persons with psychosocial disabilities could be involuntarily detained in institutions under currently legislation. What measures were in place to ensure that psychiatric interventions were voluntary and based on human rights? Was the State party aware that all persons with disabilities had a right to live in the community on an equal basis with others? What measures were in place to promote deinstitutionalisation?\n\nA Committee Expert asked whether organizations of persons with intellectual disabilities were run by persons with intellectual disabilities. How many children and adults had intellectual disabilities?\n\nAnother Committee Expert asked about measures to support persons with disabilities in disaster situations.\n\nA Committee Expert asked about steps taken to ensure that restraints, segregation, and drugging did not take place without the permission of the person involved.\n\nOne Committee Expert asked if there were persons with disabilities on the committee established to examine judicial safeguards. Was training provided to judges and court clerks on how to relate to persons with disabilities? Was the delegation aware that the death penalty was considered a form of cruel and degrading treatment?\n\nResponses by the Delegation\n\nCHIA YONG YONG, Consultant on Disability Issues, Ministry of Social and Family Development, said that she had found that building a culture of inclusivity through empathy was important. Parliament house had been made accessible through a change in mindset rather than through legislation.\n\nThe delegation said that Singapore had stepped up support for assistive technologies. Children with disabilities had access to assistive devices through therapists, who also provided training on using the devices. Schemes to make these devices affordable were being reviewed.\n\nGuide dogs were permitted in public transport, taxis and licenced restaurants. Guidelines on identifying guide dogs had been developed. The State party was working on improving access to other assistance dogs for persons who needed them.\n\nUnder Singaporean laws, all persons were assumed to have mental capacity unless proven that they lacked such capacity. Singapore’s laws considered persons’ beliefs and culture when determining best interests. Supported decision-making was provided when required, but proxy decision-making was allowed if supported decision-making was not possible.\n\nThere were 913 adults living in institutions. Institutional care was a last resort. More than 97 per cent of persons with disabilities lived in the community. New institutions were being built to ensure that the State had sufficient capacity for persons who chose to live there. There had only been seven court-ordered appointments to institutions since 2020. Under the enabling masterplan, community mental health services were being expanded, and community intervention teams had been established to provide home counselling. These measures had led to a decrease in institutionalisation.\n\nSingapore’s building regulations required all new buildings to be barrier-free and accessible. Accessibility facilities were also retrofitted to existing buildings.\n\nSingapore was committed to ensuring effective access to justice for persons with disabilities. In criminal investigations and court proceedings, trained volunteers facilitated communications between police officers and persons suspected of having intellectual disabilities. Specialised prosecutors had been trained to work with persons with disabilities. Sign language interpretation was provided in court as needed. All eligible defendants with disabilities could access Government-funded legal aid.\n\nMeasures were in place to ensure the ease of reporting and protection for victims of gender-based violence.\n\nSingaporean immigration laws did not discriminate based on disability. When a foreign person sought employment in Singapore, they were not required to disclose disabilities when applying for employment passes.\n\nThe protection of persons with disabilities was a central part of the disaster reduction framework. Persons with disabilities were provided with text and audio notifications about disasters, and evacuation routes were required to consider persons with disabilities. Fire drills were conducted regularly, and the civil defence force was training to support persons with disabilities.\n\nThe Tripartite Committee on Workplace Fairness was developing a law preventing discrimination in the workplace. The Committee was currently deliberating the scope of legislation and the specific remedies available.\n\nCorporal punishment was rarely used in schools, and only in cases where it was necessary. Teachers focused on preventative strategies.\n\nPrison inmates had access to mental healthcare support and religious counselling. Psychiatric treatment could be administered involuntarily if necessary. Persons in custody could be housed separately to prevent self-harm. The Mental Health Care and Treatment Act determined that mental health care could be implemented involuntarily to protect the person involved and others. A magistrate’s order was required for the detention of a person in a mental health institution beyond a certain period. Informed consent was required for tests, treatment and procedures in mental health institutions. Seclusion and forced drugging were not practiced. Electroconvulsive therapy and restraints were only used when necessary.\n\nTraining for social workers in the field of mental health was provided at universities. The Singapore Judicial College featured training on how to engage litigants with personality disorders. Officers who worked with people with mental health illnesses were required to undergo training on providing support to those persons. Suitable youth offenders with intellectual disabilities underwent a six-month guidance programme. Specialist services were provided to offenders on probation to assist their rehabilitation.\n\nThere were no persons with intellectual disabilities running intellectual disability organizations, but the State welcomed the participation of such persons in intellectual disability organizations.\n\nThe average employment rate of persons with disabilities was 30.1 per cent in 2020-2021, an increase from 28.2 per cent in 2018-2019. However, more could be done to facilitate the employment of persons with disabilities. Employers could access Government support regarding training and hiring of persons with disabilities. The Government’s target was to bring the employment rate up to 40 per cent in 2030. To achieve this, the Government was establishing “enabling business hubs” to support regional businesses to employ persons with disabilities.\n\nQuestions by Committee Experts\n\nSAOWALAK THONGKUAY, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, asked about mechanisms in place to ensure the basic needs of persons with disabilities in mental health institutions, and to ensure access to support and social protection. What steps had the State party taken to improve data collection mechanisms and to implement a national disability survey?\n\nMARKUS SCHEFER, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, said that there were several indications that freedom of expression of persons with disabilities was curtailed in the State. Would the State party consider re-evaluating its approach to providing free expression and participation of persons with disabilities?\n\nA Committee Expert asked about measures to recognise Singapore sign language as an official language. What efforts were being made to include a disability perspective in all policies and programmes, including international cooperation activates?\n\nAnother Committee Expert said that the law on mental disability established a substitute decision-making system. What legal capacity did a person with psychosocial disabilities have under this law? Had measures been adopted to promote reporting of violence from carers against persons with disabilities? What measures were in place to ensure that medical practitioners did not provide negative information on having a child with a disability?\n\nOne Committee Expert asked about measures taken to increase the awareness of employers of the needs of persons with disabilities, and to increase job satisfaction levels and support training for persons with disabilities. Had steps been taken to support persons with disabilities to participate in public life? Were persons with disabilities included in management boards of Government institutions?\n\nA Committee Expert said that discrimination was occurring regarding the provision of health and life insurance for persons with disabilities. What measures were in place to eliminate this discrimination? What measures were in place to support persons with disabilities to access private health insurance?\n\nThe Association of Southeast Asian Nations’ enabling masterplan sought to protect the rights of persons with disabilities across the region. How did the State intend to involve persons with disabilities in measures to strengthen good governance and rights of persons with disabilities in the region?\n\nA Committee Expert asked about measures to ensure access to affordable assistive devices. Did the State guarantee access to public housing programmes for persons with disabilities? Did the national monitoring board on disability comply with the Paris Principles?\n\nAnother Committee Expert asked about action taken to withdraw the reservation to article 25 (e) of the Convention. What measures were in place to support the provision of longer-term jobs for persons with disabilities?\n\nOne Committee Expert asked for information on the availability of accessible information within the healthcare system. Did the definition of disability encompass mental health? Did persons with disabilities have access to sign language interpreters in hospitals? What training was being provided to public officials on the human rights model of disability? More could be done to expand health insurance coverage as insurance industry practices violated the principles of the Convention.\n\nA Committee Expert asked whether Singapore had taken steps to establish a national human rights institute?\n\nAnother Committee Expert asked about support systems for children with disabilities in schools. What measures were in place to prevent bullying of such children? How did the State provide support for autistic adults? Why were autistic persons’ applications for health insurance rejected? Were steps being taken to make reporting of autism voluntary to employers?\n\nA Committee Expert said that children with disabilities remained segregated in special schools. What measures were in place to ensure that all children studied in an inclusive education environment? Bullying was common against children with autism. What measures were in place to prevent bullying and other harmful practices in schools? Were school graduation certificates of persons with disabilities annotated with details of their adapted education scheme?\n\nAnother Committee Expert asked if the State party would include persons with disabilities on committees examining legislation affecting them. Were persons with disabilities provided with support to run for elections?\n\nOne Committee Expert asked about what happened to persons with disabilities who spoke up about violence and abuse. Was a helpline on abuse accessible to persons with disabilities, and were helpline workers trained in dealing with persons with intellectual disabilities?\n\nResponses by the Delegation\n\nThe delegation said that financial and tax support was provided to low-wage workers with disabilities. Persons with disabilities who were not able to work received additional cash, medical and employment assistance. All residential housing built since 2006 was barrier-free. Subsidies were provided for home ownership.\n\nSingapore had a multi-layer health financing scheme. Various subsidies ensured that all citizens had access to healthcare. All Singaporean residents were provided with 75 to 80 per cent coverage of hospital fees under State medical insurance. The Government intended to draft guidelines on the issuance of private health insurance to ensure access for persons with disabilities.\n\nSingapore had established a loan library for assistance technologies, and the assistive technology fund offered subsidies on the purchase and repair of devices.\n\nExamination certificates included annotations explaining the conditions in which students undertook examinations. These did not indicate disabilities and were not used to discriminate. Some special schools were collocated with mainstream partners, and special and mainstream school students were encouraged to interact. Bullying of any form was not acceptable. Schools responded promptly to bullying, with trained staff implementing appropriate measures. Students were encouraged to speak up against bullying.\n\nSince September 2021, the Tripartite Committee on Workplace Fairness had organised consultation sessions with persons with disabilities, aiming to incorporate their views in the Committee’s deliberations on upcoming anti-discrimination workplace legislation. Today, the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices required that employers not ask jobseekers about disabilities unless there was a job-related requirement. Employers could receive subsidies for employing persons with disabilities. Job coaches were provided to persons with disabilities to help them obtain work and settle into new jobs. The Inclusive Business Forum was a networking platform on disability inclusion in the workplace.\n\nPersons with disabilities had the right to form political parties and run for office. Since 2014, two persons with disabilities had held positions as nominated members of parliament. Two youth leaders with disabilities sat on the board of the National Youth Council.\n\nThe State party intended to withdraw its reservation to 25 (e) of the Convention once guidelines for private insurers had been released.\n\nCarers were restricted from being present when persons with disabilities voted. Funnels had been installed on ballot boxes and stamp pens had been introduced to make the voting process easier for persons with disabilities.\n\nThe State party recognised the importance of data on disability. Surveys of persons with disabilities were conducted using the World Health Organization’s quality of life index, and recently a survey had been conducted using the Washington Group’s short set of questions. Targets and indicators had been set in the enabling masterplans, and data related to these would be made available to the public on a regular basis. The Government also planned to develop a central disability register to identify the needs of persons with disabilities.\n\nSingapore encouraged the participation of persons with disabilities in international disability support programmes. In April 2021, an Association of Southeast Asian Nations’ conference on disability rights post pandemic had been held.\n\nThe national anti-violence and sexual harassment hotline was manned by trained social workers, who were required to provide communication support to ensure that every case was followed up on. The Government intended to set up a web service to ensure that persons who could not use the telephone line could receive support.\n\nSingapore ensured that Government communications were accessible and provided in various languages. All key communications were provided with sign language interpretation. Braille information was still provided, despite lower demand. Television broadcasts had sign language interpretation or captioning. The Government provided subsidies to students with disabilities to access supportive communication technologies.\n\nVarious resources on COVID-19 prevention measures and vaccination were made available to persons with disabilities in accessible formats. There were existing protocols to ensure effective communication with persons with disabilities in medical institutions. Sign language interpretation was available at such institutions. Medical students were required to attend courses on disability perspectives and needs. Sexual and reproductive health education was provided to children with disabilities. Hospitals provided counselling to parents of children with disabilities, and continued care was provided after birth.\n\nCHIA YONG YONG, Consultant on Disability Issues, Ministry of Social and Family Development, said organizations of persons with disabilities had been key members of steering committees in the development of various laws and policies, including the “enabling business hubs”. The early intervention programme was also carried out in collaboration with an organization of persons with disabilities.\n\nClosing Remarks\n\nERIC CHUA, Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Social and Family Development and Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth of Singapore and head of the delegation, thanked the Committee for the open and insightful dialogue. Singapore had made significant improvements, but there was room to do better. The State party would consider the recommendations of the Committee seriously. It would continue to ensure that schools, workplaces and transport were accessible for persons with disabilities, and work to increase the employment rate of persons with disabilities. It would also work to support accessible communication, and to allow persons with disabilities to participate in creating legislation and policies that affected them. Singapore was fully committed to removing barriers for persons with disabilities, and to building an inclusive society that allowed persons with disabilities to achieve their full potential.\n\nMARKUS SCHEFER, Committee Expert and Country Co-Rapporteur, said that the State party had provided detailed explanations of its efforts in employment, healthcare, education and other areas. Great efforts were still required to fulfil the provisions of the Convention. The Convention required States parties to broaden their views of human rights. The goals of the Convention could not be achieved with far-reaching adaptations of its provisions. States needed to support persons with disabilities to participate in society as equals, and revise legal systems accordingly. All persons with disabilities needed to be recognised as persons before the law. The Convention required Singapore to fundamentally re-evaluate domestic legislation, but the delegation had not exhibited this willingness. Mr. Schefer called on the State party to delve into the logic of the Convention and to guarantee the rights of persons with disabilities from the Convention’s perspective.",
    "S'pore plays host to high-profile conferences and industry shakers during F1 week": "SINGAPORE - Hundreds of chief executives, crypto investors and innovators, and even a Bollywood star are flying in this week for a series of high-profile Mice events.\n\nLeveraging the return of the Singapore Airlines Singapore Grand Prix F1 race from Friday to Sunday, it is the latest sign that Singapore is returning to pre-Covid-19 pandemic normality.\n\nThis week, several large-scale meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions (Mice) will make their debut.\n\nThat includes the inaugural edition of the Time100 Leadership Forum on Oct 2.\n\nHeld at the National Gallery Singapore, it will feature speakers such as former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt.\n\nLater that day, there will be a ceremony, in which people who have done extraordinary work to shape the future of their industries and the world will be recognised.\n\nBollywood actress and producer Alia Bhatt, Broadway star Lea Salonga, and Mr Gregory L. Robinson, the former James Webb Space Telescope programme director at United States space agency Nasa, will be given Time100 Impact Awards.\n\nThe Singapore Tourism Board in August said nearly 90,000 delegates are expected to attend about 25 Mice events held around the same time as the F1 race.\n\nThe number of events are similar to pre-Covid-19 levels, it added.\n\nSome of these events were moved from Hong Kong to Singapore partly due to the keen interest in people once again meeting face to face and closing deals in person.\n\nFor instance, SuperReturn Asia - a key private equity and venture capital conference - was held in Singapore from Sept 19 to Sept 22.\n\nIt attracted a record 1,500 people, or almost double the pre-pandemic record of 800 people in 2019.\n\nAnd this week, the Asia Crypto Week will kick off, focusing on a two-day crypto conference called Token2049, which makes its Singapore debut. It will be held on Wednesday and Thursday.",
    "How Singapore Changi Avoided Chaos Following Passenger Recovery": "The international hub has so far managed to avoid making headlines for long queues, delays, or even baggage mishandling issues.\n\nSingapore Changi Airport IATA/ICAO Code: SIN/WSSS Country: Singapore CEO: Lee Seow Hiang Passenger Count : 3,053,000 (2021) Runways : 02L/20R - 4,000m (13,123ft) |02C/20C - 4,000m (13,123ft) |02R/20L - 4,000m (13,123ft) Terminals: Terminal 1 |Terminal 2 |Terminal 3 |Terminal 4 |JetQuay CIP Terminal\n\nThe Asia-Pacific region has been slow to recover in the post-pandemic aviation industry due to the conservative lifting of restrictions, although the rebound for air travel within Singapore is a lot quicker. The country fully reopened its borders on April 1st, and passenger traffic within Changi International Airport quickly filled the initial two opened terminals as airlines began operating more flights.\n\nAnd just some months into August, Changi Airport has already surpassed more than 55% of its pre-pandemic passenger levels. The government forecasted the number of flights would reach at least 80% of pre-pandemic levels by the year-end, during the peak holiday travel season.\n\nDespite how busy the international hub has been within the tiny tropical island, Changi Airport has managed to avoid the chaos experienced by airport rivals in Australia, Europe and North America. Let's take a look at how the airport prepared itself.\n\nTroubles at the airports\n\nAirports within Australia, Europe, and North America have had to shed hundreds and even thousands of staff during the pandemic and had trouble rehiring the required workforce numbers as quickly due to security clearances and time needed for training. And when the global aviation industry emerged into the post-pandemic period, these airports found themselves highly short-handed.\n\nThe problem was fueled by industrial walkouts of airport staff over wage issues and poor working conditions. And to top it all off, airports were further caught off guard when airlines started ramping up their flight schedules to profit from the then-upcoming summer season. More flights meant more passengers, but perhaps it was much more than the understaffed airports were prepared to handle.\n\nEventually, traveling this year became an awful mix of long lines extending beyond the airports' terminals and onto roads, lost luggage that passengers could not recover, and mass flight cancelations and delays. The experiences have left passengers feeling exhausted and frustrated instead of relaxed and excited, and several once-well-known airports have lost the trust of their once loyal passengers, as they instead seek the services of smaller, regional airports to avoid chaos.\n\nA peek into Changi's strategy\n\nLast month, Changi Airport saw more than 20,000 aircraft movements and approximately 3.32 million passenger movements. Though the numbers may not be on the same scale compared to its rival airports, it is part of the airport's strategy. The strategy also included consistent meetings with airlines and critical suppliers like ground handling companies SATS and Dnata and cleaning and catering companies to ensure flights could be increased without affecting service levels.\n\nAccording to Jayson Goh, Changi Airport Group's managing director of Airport Operations, the airport operator worked with airlines to change flight times instead of stopping or adding services. He commented:\n\n\"You can say OK; this hour is a peak. Can I still fly, but I fly two hours earlier or two hours later so that you don’t try to clash with a peak?”\n\nAnd unlike its rival counterparts, Changi Airport was more fortunate enough to retain about 25,000 of the 35,000 employees it had before the pandemic, with aid from government programs. And since Singapore reopened its borders, the airport hired another 10,000 staff to help with increased operations. With airlines wanting to increase flight schedules and passengers pouring in, Changi Airport reopened its previously closed terminals to even out the capacity, further ensuring smoother flight operations.\n\nThe airport was also strategically reopening its previously closed terminals to balance out passenger capacity and demand, with Terminal 4 reopened on September 13th .

With several non-stop flights between destinations yet to be restored, and as the year-end school holidays approach, Changi Airport will certainly have its terminals full. Still, seeing how it has coped so far with quite the strategy, it's unlikely the airport will run into any significant problems.",
    "Recent and Upcoming Enhancements to Singapore's Work Pass Framework": "Singapore Labor, Employment, and Workplace Safety Alert\n\nOn 29 August 2022, Singapore’s Ministry of Manpower (MOM), Ministry of Trade and Industry, and Ministry of Communications and Information announced four key enhancements to Singapore’s work pass framework, namely:\n\nIntroduction of a new Overseas Networks & Expertise Work Pass (ONEWP) for talents comparable to the top 5% of Employment Pass (EP) holders. Introduction of a new public benchmark for exemption from some existing work pass requirements. Changes to existing EP application processes. Option of a five-year EP for qualified tech professionals.\n\nThe purpose of these enhancements is to strengthen Singapore’s position as a global hub for talent.\n\nIntroduction of New Overseas Networks & Expertise Work Pass\n\nThe ONEWP is a personalised five-year work pass that allows holders to start, operate, and work for multiple companies in Singapore at the same time. Applications for the new ONEWP will open on 1 January 2023. The MOM has announced that there will be a few application routes, although it is not yet clear what the different application routes or process will be. Nevertheless, it has been established that applicants will typically need to have earned a fixed monthly salary of at least S$30,000 within the last year or will earn a fixed monthly salary of at least S$30,000 under their future employer based in Singapore. As an exception, candidates with outstanding achievements across the arts and culture, sports, science and technology, and research and academia may qualify for an ONEWP even if they do not meet the S$30,000 minimum salary requirement.\n\nOther key features of the ONEWP, as compared to an EP, are briefly summarized below:\n\nONEWP EP Concurrent Employment Permitted. ONEWP holders may start, operate, and work for multiple companies in Singapore. Not permitted. EP holders can only work in Singapore for the employer who has sponsored their EP. Letter of Consent for Spouses to Work Permitted. Not permitted. Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) Job Advertising Requirement Not permitted. Required. Before an employer can submit an EP application, it must first advertise the vacancy on MyCareersFuture for at least 14 days. Complementarity Assessment Framework (COMPASS) Not applicable. Applicable for new EP applications from 1 September 2023 and renewal EP applications from 1 September 2024. Annual Notification to MOM of Professional Activities Required. ONEWP holders will be required to notify the MOM annually of their professional activities so as to ensure that they are using the flexibility afforded to them under the ONEWP to contribute meaningfully. Not required.\n\nIntroduction of a New Public Benchmark for Exemption From Some Existing Work Pass Requirements\n\nPresently, EP holders who earn fixed monthly salaries of S$20,000 and above are exempted from the FCF job advertising requirement and the upcoming COMPASS. Individuals who fall under this category of EP holders are also eligible for the Personalised Employment Pass (PEP), as an alternative to the EP. From 1 September 2023, to provide greater clarity on the MOM’s work pass framework for talent, the MOM will implement a new public benchmark for such candidates, namely:\n\nThe exemption bar for the FCF job advertising requirement and COMPASS will be raised from S$20,000 to S$22,500; and\n\nThe minimum salary criteria for the PEP will be raised from S$18,000 for overseas foreign professionals and S$12,000 for existing EP holders to S$22,500 for all PEP applicants.\n\nChanges to Existing EP Application Processes\n\nTo enable employers to be more responsive to business needs, the MOM has implemented the following changes:\n\nFrom 1 September 2022, the FCF job advertising requirement duration has been reduced from 28 days to 14 days.\n\nWith immediate effect, the MOM will improve processing time for all EP applications such that EP applications will be processed, or an update provided to employers, within 10 business days.\n\nOption of a Five-Year EP for Qualified Tech Professionals\n\nPresently, EPs may be granted for durations of up to two years for first-time candidates and up to three years for renewal candidates. From 1 September 2023, in order to allow Singapore to anchor tech capabilities and develop Singapore’s local pipeline, the MOM will offer the option of a five-year EP to candidates who:\n\nare experienced professionals filling specific tech occupations on the COMPASS Shortage Occupation List (which will be announced in March 2023);\n\nearn a fixed monthly salary of at least S$10,500 (with older candidates commanding higher salaries); and\n\npass COMPASS and score at least 10 points on the COMPASS Diversity criterion.\n\nWhat This Means for Employers in Singapore\n\nIn view of the recent and upcoming changes discussed above, it is expected that employers in Singapore will be provided with more options in order to be responsive to their workforce needs, enhance workforce planning, and to better tap into the global talent pool.\n\nWhat We Can Do to Assist\n\nWe can assist with advising on the details of the changes to Singapore’s work pass regime, as well as assisting employers with the relevant work pass applications.",
    "Stopping drugs: How Singapore screens travellers arriving at Changi Airport": "SINGAPORE: Two years after COVID-19 halted travel and turned Changi Airport into a ghost town, the air hub has come alive again.\n\nCrowds of travellers form queues at check-in counters. Families wave off loved ones at boarding gates. Suitcases roll by on baggage belts.\n\nBut even as the buzz returns to Changi, another challenge has come up for Singapore's security agencies – the legalisation of cannabis in other countries, most notably nearby Thailand, which started allowing the use of the drug in June.\n\nWith more than 16.5 million passengers having passed through Changi Airport this year, how is Singapore keeping drugs like cannabis at bay?\n\nCNA got an inside look into the process, which starts at a restricted area on the tarmac where check-in baggage from flights are processed after they land.\n\nThis is where Bailey, a six-and-a-half-year-old English springer spaniel from the police K-9 unit, is stationed with his handler Sergeant Ryan Low."
