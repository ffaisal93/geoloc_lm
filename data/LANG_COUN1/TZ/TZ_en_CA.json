    "Canada to end all COVID travel restrictions from October 1": "The move is likely to boost the Canadian travel industry, already booming after months of lull during the pandemic.\n\nCanada will drop all COVID-19 restrictions for travellers from October 1, including vaccination and masking requirements for flights and trains, the government has said.\n\nThe move, announced on Monday, is likely to boost the Canadian travel industry, already booming after months of lull during the pandemic.\n\nCanadian carriers were also pressing for an end to mask mandates on flights, citing thousands of incidents of non-compliance this year alone.\n\n“As Canadians and international visitors look to make travel plans, the long-awaited removal of all remaining measures effective Oct. 1, 2022 will further expedite recovery for our industry and the Canadian economy,” Canada’s second-largest carrier, WestJet Airlines, said in a statement.\n\nThe decision to end restrictions was based on Canada’s vaccination rate, the availability of newer vaccines and treatments and data showing the country had passed the peak of the latest wave of coronavirus infections, the government said.\n\nMore than 90 percent of Canadians over age 12 have taken the primary series of a COVID-19 vaccine. This month, Canada authorised Moderna Inc’s bivalent COVID-19 shots for adults, the country’s first Omicron-adapted vaccine.\n\n“Thanks largely to Canadians who have rolled up their sleeves to get vaccinated, we have reached the point where we can safely lift the sanitary measures at the border,” Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos said.\n\nDuclos said the government was prepared to reinstate restrictions if needed.\n\n“Obviously we have no hope to reintroduce some of these measures but if we need to protect the safety of Canadians, we will have to,” he told reporters in Ottawa.\n\nTravellers, regardless of citizenship, will not have to submit health information through the ArriveCAN app or provide proof of vaccination from Saturday.\n\nA requirement for travellers to wear masks on planes and trains would also be dropped. Cruise ship passengers and crew would also no longer be subject to vaccine requirements or COVID-19 testing.",

    "Today’s crises highlight need for more multilateralism, stronger UN, says Canada’s Foreign Minister": "“These crises and the way we choose to respond to them are testing our shared commitment to the United Nations. That’s why our decisions matter now more than ever,” Canada’s Foreign Minister, Mélanie Joly, told the General Assembly’s annual high-level debate on Monday.\n\n‘More multilateralism, not less’\n\n“We have a choice – either we respect and defend the rules that we collectively have developed for generations and that have given us the longest period of peace in modern history or we accept that rules can be broken by the powerful, bringing us back to darker times of constant tensions and conflicts, with massive displacements, suffering and losses of human lives.\n\n“For Canada, the choice is clear: we’re convinced that we need more multilateralism, not less; we need more of the UN, not less; and we need a UN that is effective, efficient, relevant and accountable.”\n\nOn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Ms. Joly said the 193-member General Assembly has spoken clearly and with conviction.\n\n“Russia’s aggressions against Ukraine violate the UN Charter. It strikes at the heart of the commitment we all made in building this Organization from the dark tragedy of the Second World War. Rather than follow this Assembly’s decisions and a legally-binding order from the International Court of Justice, Russia had doubled down, including with a desperate effort to justify the unjustifiable.”\n\nNoting that while the world gathered in New York, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russia will conscript more young people to the war.\n\n“For Putin, this is a war to the death; for Ukraine, it is a war for life,” Ms. Joly stated.\n\nThe impacts of this “illegal” war are profoundly felt around the world, she continued. “We must address the global food security crisis and other consequences of the illegal invasion with imagination and determination.\n\n“And those who break the law must be met with the force of the law. A permanent seat on the Security Council not a license to kill nor to silence anyone, and it should never guarantee impunity.”\n\nNo country left behind’\n\nTurning to other major challenges, Ms. Joly highlighted the need to redouble efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, and to reforming the international financial institutions to enable them to adapt to today’s crises.\n\n“No country must be left behind,” she stressed, adding that Canada is working with partners for just and equitable reform of the international financial system, which is crucial for equity and for global peace and stability.\n\nCanada, she went on, is committed to ending the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as tackling HIV, tuberculosis and malaria. Last week, Prime Minister Trudeau committed to investing $1.2 billion in these efforts.;\n\n‘More urgency on climate’\n\nOn climate change, Ms. Joly said the world must act with the same urgency as during the COVID pandemic.\n\n“From the Arctic to the small island States, climate change is an existential threat, and we are feeling its effects every day,” she said. “Canada has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by 2030 and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, and we have a credible plan to do so.”\n\nThere are no simple solutions to the challenges the world is facing, she noted. “But it is clear that to isolate ourselves, to disregard the rule of law and to force people into silence runs counter to progress. And yet, certain countries are restricting civil liberties, violating human rights and conducting widespread surveillance of their population.\n\n“This trend towards authoritarianism is extremely worrying,” she stated, drawing particular attention to the Xinjiang region of China.\n\nOn human rights, no ‘defending the indefensible’\n\nLikewise, Canada is concerned about the repression of human rights seen in several countries. “We know that human rights are universal by nature. Therefore, we cannot hide behind the pretext of national sovereignty to violate them; there are limits to defending the indefensible.”\n\nMs. Joly also stressed the equality of women and girls as crucial for peace, justice and prosperity. Canada will repel increasing attacks on the rights and freedoms of women – from Afghanistan, where the Taliban are preventing women and girls from going to school, to Myanmar, where the women who are openly calling for a return to democracy are imprisoned by the military junta, tortured and subjected to “horrific” acts of sexual violence.\n\n“In Iran,” she continued, “women protesting the death of Mahsa Amini are met with arrests and bullets. We salute their courage and join them in sending a strong message that women’s rights are human rights.\n\n“Today, Prime Minister Trudeau announced that Canada will sanction those responsible, including Iran’s so-called morality police and its leadership.”",

    "Canada: Nova Scotia To End Immigration Detention in Jails": "Click to expand Image Nova Scotia becomes the Second Canadian Province to End Immigration Detention in its Jails. © Human Rights Watch 2022\n\n(Halifax) – Nova Scotia’s confirmation that it will terminate its immigration detention contract with the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) is another win for migrant and refugee rights, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International Canada said today. The move follows a landmark decision by British Columbia on July 21 to terminate its own contract with the border agency.\n\n“Nova Scotia’s decision is a momentous human rights victory that upholds the dignity and rights of people who come to Canada in search of safety or a better life,” said Samer Muscati, associate disability rights director at Human Rights Watch. “With two provinces now canceling their immigration detention contracts within weeks, the federal government should show leadership by canceling the remaining agreements, which are at the heart of so many rights violations.”\n\nOver the past five years, CBSA has incarcerated thousands of people on immigration grounds in dozens of provincial jails across the country. In Nova Scotia, they are held in provincial jails by default because the province has no dedicated immigration holding center. According to information accessed under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, as of April 2021 the federal government pays Nova Scotia one of the highest rates in the country, CAD $392.30 per day, for each immigration detainee.\n\n“As a result of Nova Scotia’s decision, immigration detainees will soon be spared the corrosive, human rights-impairing conditions of the province's jails, where solitary confinement, mass lockdowns and other forms of routine institutional violence have only intensified since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Sheila Wildeman, Co-Chair of East Coast Prison Justice Society and associate professor of law at Dalhousie University. “We call on the federal government to use the resources devoted to maintaining this brutal practice to instead invest in sustainable immigration settlement supports in the community.”\n\nIn a June 2021 report, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International documented that people in Canadian immigration detention are regularly handcuffed, shackled, and held with little to no contact with the outside world. Canada is among only a few countries in the global north with no legal limit on the duration of immigration detention, meaning people can be detained for months or years with no end in sight.\n\nThe border agency has full discretion over where people in immigration detention are held, with no legal standard guiding the agency’s decision to hold a person in a provincial jail rather than an immigration holding center. In the year following the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the agency relied more heavily on provincial jails, holding 40 percent of immigration detainees in those facilities, at least double the percentage in each of the three previous years.\n\nPeople with psychosocial disabilities (mental health conditions) experience discrimination throughout the immigration detention process. For example, CBSA policy indicates that immigration detainees with psychosocial disabilities may be incarcerated in provincial jails rather than dedicated federal immigration holding centers in order to access “specialized care.” People from communities of color, and Black people in particular, appear to be incarcerated for longer periods in immigration detention and often in provincial jails instead of immigration holding centers.\n\nAcross the Atlantic provinces and throughout the country, migrants and refugee claimants too frequently face abusive, open-ended immigration detention – especially traumatic for those fleeing war or persecution in search of a safe haven,” said Julie Chamagne, Executive Director of the Halifax Refugee Clinic. “Nova Scotia’s decision is an important step forward for human rights. We call on the federal government to enact robust legislative and regulatory changes to stop rights violations in this system across the country.”\n\nNova Scotia’s decision is building powerful momentum to end immigration detention in provincial jails, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International said. Since the start of the #WelcomeToCanada campaign in Nova Scotia six months ago, approximately 4,600 people have called on the province to take this step.\n\n“We commend Nova Scotia for its decision to stop locking up refugee claimants and migrants in the province’s jails solely on immigration grounds,” said Ketty Nivyabandi, secretary general of Amnesty International Canada (English Speaking). “There is now clear pressure to end this harmful practice across the country. We urge other provinces and the federal government to follow suit.”",

    "Opinion: Why are Chinese police operating in Canada, while our own government and security services apparently look the other way?": "Unit 1 & 2 at 220 Royal Crest CT, in Markham, Ont. This addredd home to a registered NGO is reportedly being used by Chinese police as a base of operations in the GTA.YADER GUZMAN/The Globe and Mail\n\nCharles Burton is a senior fellow at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute in Ottawa, and non-resident senior fellow of the European Values Center for Security Policy in Prague. He served as a diplomat at Canada’s embassy in Beijing.\n\nIn China, the high-profile TV drama In The Name Of The People has become a smash hit. In that show, Chinese agents enter the U.S. posing as businessmen so they can repatriate a factory manager who had fled abroad with huge ill-gotten wealth.\n\nBut a new study by the European non-governmental agency Safeguard Defenders suggests that there might be some truth to the fiction. According to the NGO, the Fuzhou Public Security Bureau has established more than 50 “overseas police service centres” in cities around the world – including three publicly documented ones in Toronto, home to Canada’s largest Chinese diaspora.\n\nThis is an outrage. Chinese police setting up offices in Canada, then “persuading” alleged criminals to return to the motherland to face “justice” – while our own government and security services apparently choose to look the other way – represents a gross violation of Canada’s national sovereignty, international law and the norms of diplomacy. China is extending the grip of its Orwellian police state into this country, with seemingly no worry about being confronted by our own national security agencies.\n\nThe RCMP and politicians of all stripes routinely condemn Chinese state harassment of people in Canada, but what action has been taken? There have been no arrests or any expulsion of any Chinese diplomats who might be co-ordinating this kind of thuggery.\n\nBeijing describes these global police outposts as administrative centres to help Chinese nationals renew driver’s licences and other domestic banalities back home. But the Safeguard Defenders study found that they also hunt down political dissidents, corrupt officials or rogue Chinese alleged criminals and urge them to return home.\n\nThe summary says some of these operatives are given cover by being formally attached to local Chinese Overseas Home Associations (which have themselves largely become co-opted by the Chinese Communist Party’s United Front Work operations and run out of China’s embassy and consulates).\n\nThis bold strategy is consistent with China’s propensity for routinely flouting international laws, including those that require any other country’s police wishing to gather evidence in Canada to work through the RCMP.\n\nIn the case of these “police service centres,” Safeguard Defenders reports that agents press their targets to return home, including by offering vague promises of leniency or even urging families back home to encourage them to do so. The officers have taken aim at these alleged (and unproven) criminals by seizing their families’ assets, denying children in China access to schools, and terminating family members’ employment, all in violation of due process.\n\nIn Canada, this has been a reality for years. In 2001, during refugee hearings in Vancouver for Lai Changxing – a businessman wanted by Beijing over accusations of corruption and smuggling – Chinese police admitted to entering Canada using fake documents, and even to spiriting in Mr. Lai’s brother in an attempt to convince him to return home. Canadian authorities effectively smiled benignly at this serious breach of criminal and immigration law; Mr. Lai was eventually deported back to China.\n\nCanada is becoming China’s chew toy. Consider Beijing’s alleged disinformation campaign which helped “unfriendly” Conservative MPs of Chinese ethnicity, including Kenny Chiu, lose their seats in the 2021 federal election.\n\nOttawa wants Canadian businesses to be able to tap into the world’s largest market. But the price of this access appears to be ignoring Beijing’s Canadian agenda, from military and industrial espionage to harassing Canadian Uyghurs, Tibetans, Falun Gong practitioners and ethnic Chinese and Taiwanese people who reject Beijing’s hectoring that they should be loyal to China instead of to Canada.\n\nDoes Canada have no security capabilities on the issue? Our police and security agencies must surely know what is going on, but for some reason prefer to simply curate their information rather than act on it. When asked by The Globe and Mail about the police service centres, an RCMP spokesperson said the force would not comment on “uncorroborated media reports or statements.” And most of the information we receive about China’s illegal and “grey zone” activities in Canada typically comes from the U.S. government and well-funded security and intelligence-focused think tanks in Australia and Europe.\n\nThe more we ignore reports of China’s growing presence in Canada – including its interference in our electoral process, its potential espionage in our universities and research institutes, and so on – the more emboldened and manipulative Chinese agents become. With no sign that it will be held accountable, China will only increase the size and threat of its operations, because it can.\n\nWith its seeming indifference toward China’s blatant contempt for our laws and security, Ottawa is playing an extremely dangerous game with Canada’s sovereignty.",

    "Climate change means Atlantic Canada will see more frequent storms": "Hurricanes don’t usually maintain high wind speeds as they make their way toward Atlantic Canada. But ocean warming may be linked to the increasing intensity of storms like Fiona.\n\nAtlantic Canada has been left reeling from the impacts of one of the largest and most dangerous ocean storms to ever hit the region. Hurricane Fiona made landfall as a powerful post-tropical storm on Saturday along the eastern shore of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador, delivering heavy rainfall, damaging winds and massive waves.\n\nThe storm surge — a rise in seawater level — resulted in power outages, flooded roads, and in southwest Newfoundland, homes were washed away. The southwest coast of Newfoundland was hit particularly hard by extreme waves and storm surge, which were highest on the eastern side of the storm track.\n\nThe huge storm had a very low atmospheric pressure (931.6 mb) — which is the lowest ever recorded for a tropical storm that made landfall in Canada. Low pressure weather systems are associated with strong winds and heavy rains.\n\nOffshore, the wave heights exceeded eight to 10 metres on the Scotian Shelf and reached 17 metres at the Banqureau Banks wave buoy.\n\nWhile we wait for the NHC's official call, it looks like #Fiona has recently made landfall between Canso and Guysborough. With an unofficial recorded pressure at Hart Island of 931.6 mb, this makes Fiona the lowest pressured land falling storm on record in Canada. pic.twitter.com/TYo9G05sUz — ECCC Canadian Hurricane Centre (@ECCC_CHC) September 24, 2022\n\nPast storms\n\nHistorically, the Saxby Gale of 1869 was a massive storm that caused significant flooding in Nova Scotia. Other more recent storms, such as Hurricane Juan in 2003 and Hurricane Dorian in 2019 had big impacts, but they also weakened in storm intensity just before making landfall in Nova Scotia.\n\nHurricanes with the size and strength of Fiona do not usually maintain their high wind speeds this far north. This makes Hurricane Fiona a pivotal event in the Canadian coastal ocean, as it raises the question of when this will happen again.\n\nHow did Fiona get into Canadian water with such size and intensity? This is related to its heat source: the ocean. Ocean warming may be linked to the increasing intensity of storms making landfall and to the development of strong hurricanes.\n\nSo climate change leads to warmer ocean water at higher latitudes. A warmer future increases the probability that more intense storms will reach Canadian coasts.\n\nTypes of impact\n\nDepending on the size and strength of the hurricane, where it makes landfall and the shape of the coast that it strikes, the impacts can be very different.\n\nIn addition to large waves and storm surges, hurricanes also bring heavy precipitation that floods the land surface and can affect coastal groundwater systems.\n\nThese storms drive strong currents that can erode sediments and change the shape and forms of coasts. They can also affect water quality by suspending and spreading contaminants in harbours.\n\nHurricanes the size of Fiona may not occur again soon — or, a similarly intense storm could strike Atlantic Canada again within the next few years. We are making progress with recent improvements to hurricane forecasting and real-time coastal modelling.\n\nBeing able to predict the size, frequency and impact of storms helps inform warnings, decisions, responses and policies. These predictions are essential for being ready to face the next big storm event when it happens.\n\n______________________________\n\nRyan P.

    "Revenue Canada wants to tax former Winnipeg CAO and his company on bribe money, court documents reveal": "The Canada Revenue Agency wants former Winnipeg chief administrative officer Phil Sheegl and his company FSS Financial Support Services Inc. to pay taxes on bribe money the company received from the contractor that built the Winnipeg Police Service headquarters, court documents reveal.\n\nThe revenue agency said it was reassessing Sheegl's and FSS's taxes for 2011, according to a court document.\n\nThe CRA says that's because the company received a $200,000 \"secret commission,\" which is considered income that it did not declare, according to a notice of appeal filed by Sheegl on April 19, 2022, in Tax Court of Canada.\n\n\"In failing to report all its income for the 2011 taxation year, the appellant made misrepresentations attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default,\" the attorney general of Canada said in a reply to a separate notice of appeal by FSS, which was also filed on April 19.\n\nThe documents say the money Financial Support Services received came from Mountain Construction — a company controlled by Armik Babakhanians, whose main construction business is Caspian Projects Inc.\n\nThat happened in 2011, two days after Caspian was awarded a contract to build the Winnipeg Police Service headquarters, the documents say.\n\nIn 2020, the City of Winnipeg sued Sheegl, along with a number of other people and companies involved in the police headquarters project, alleging a scheme to defraud taxpayers out of millions of dollars. (Tyson Koschik/CBC)\n\nThe police HQ construction project was later the subject of a five-year RCMP investigation that ended in December 2019 with no charges laid.\n\nDocuments filed in the Tax Court of Canada say Babakhanians, through Mountain Construction, paid FSS a $200,000 cheque marked \"consulting fee\" in July 2011. Sheegl gave half to then Winnipeg mayor Sam Katz and wrote \"loan\" on the cheque.\n\nSheegl \"has no knowledge as to why the payor of the deposit referred to the amount as a 'consulting fee' on the cheque, as the amount was not an income item,\" said the FSS notice of appeal.\n\nIt says the amount was \"sale proceeds from the disposition of part of the interest\" in a share of a piece of undeveloped land in Tartesso, Ariz.\n\nWATCH | A 2017 CBC report on the Arizona land deal:\n\nFSS said it didn't declare the money as income because the money did not belong to the company.\n\nIt said $100,000 was owed to Winnix — an Arizona company owned by Sheegl. The other $100,000 was owed to Duddy Enterprises LLC, an Arizona company owned by Katz, according to FSS.\n\nSheegl says the $200,000 was sent to FSS because it's a Canadian company.\n\nWhile FSS maintains the payment was part of a 2011 real estate deal Sheegl and Katz did with Babakhanians, a Manitoba court called it a \"bribe\" in a ruling delivered earlier this year.\n\nIn January 2020, the City of Winnipeg sued Babakhanians, Sheegl and a number of other people and companies involved in the police HQ project, alleging a scheme to defraud taxpayers out of millions of dollars.\n\nThat lawsuit is still before the courts.

(CBC)\n\nIn March 2022, a justice with what was then Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench found Sheegl had accepted a bribe and breached his duty as a city officer when he took $327,200 from Babakhanians, which he split with Katz.\n\nThe money was given to Sheegl and Katz in two payments — the $200,000 Mountain sent to FSS, and $127,200 sent to a Katz company.\n\nSheegl was ordered by the Manitoba court in March to pay the city approximately $1.1 million, which included the bribe money and severance pay. He is currently appealing that decision.\n\nMust pay taxes on money given to Katz: CRA\n\nThe latest court documents say FSS is a consulting business and had reported $28,069 income in 2011, as well as a loss of $121,978 partnership income.\n\nThe attorney general's reply to the FSS appeal says \"$200,000 represents a 1,000 per cent increase over what was reported as consulting revenue.\"\n\nThe Canada Revenue Agency also reassessed Sheegl's personal income taxes on March 7, 2019, to include the $100,000 payment to Katz in 2011. The documents say Sheegl's reported income in 2011 was $208,000, but should have included that money.\n\nThe CRA says in court filings that Sheegl benefited by giving that money to Katz, who was mayor from 2004 to 2014, because he didn't have to pay taxes on it.\n\nSheegl's notice of appeal says the $100,000 payment was not made for his own benefit.\n\n\"The payment was owed to Mr. Katz/Duddy for the portion of the interest that was sold to Mr. Babakhanians,\" said Sheegl's notice of appeal. \"Therefore, the payment is not taxable in the hands of the appellant.\"\n\nIn March 2022, a Manitoba court found that Sheegl, shown here in a file photo, had accepted a bribe and breached his duty as a city officer when he took $327,200 from Winnipeg police headquarters contractor Armik Babakhanians, which he split with former mayor Sam Katz.

    "Preview: Canada faces Uruguay in important pre-World Cup match": "It’s finally happening. It’s just around the proverbial corner. The match Canadian footy fans have been long waiting for. Where Friday’s affair with Qatar was entertaining, it is viewed by many as the warm-up to this window’s main event – Tuesday’s tilt with South American and world heavyweight Uruguay.\n\nThere has been no recent competitive history between the two countries. Canada’s only previous senior match with Uruguay was on February 2nd, 1986, a 3-1 defeat for Canada at the Miami Cup. George Pakos was Canada’s goal scorer that day, with his fifth and final tally in his Canada career.\n\nUruguay is ranked 13th by FIFA and 11th in the more current Elo rankings whereas Canada is well back at 43rd in FIFA rankings and tied at 29th with South Korea in the Elo system. The “qualitative advantages” possessed by Uruguay are not lost on John Herdman, who has stated,\n\n“I have to say the game against Uruguay, that was a massive coup for Canada to pull that one off in Europe,...That’s going to be a real test and it’s not necessarily a tactical test. This will be the first time you play a team of $400-million value. When you think you play the U.S., and they’re at that 250-mark, you double that now when you are playing Uruguay.”\n\nHerdman further remarked\n\n”It’s just another level. We can’t wait. It’s pretty exciting.”\n\nCanada’s roster is missing some key personnel, such as midfielder and national team captain Atiba Hutchinson, Doneil Henry, and last minute withdrawal Jonathan Osorio. The latter’s nagging head injury producing “neurological dysfunction” symptoms is becoming a concern to John Herdman. Tajon Buchanan has been a late arrival to the camp and is expected to play limited minutes on Tuesday as he recovers from injury. Alphonso Davies took a knock just prior to leaving the Qatar game, but it appears to have not been too serious and has resumed regular training with the team.\n\nHerdman has brought a seeming surfeit of wingers and attackers into the squad. Who and how many play is up for debate. Four of five strikers brought into the CanMNT camp saw the field against Qatar on Friday with the odd man out being Lucas Cavallini. Given Cavallini’s South American roots and early career playing professionally in Uruguay, he will be chomping at the bit to see action against La Celeste. However, it is more likely he comes off the bench rather than starts.\n\nWingers in the squad who did not see action against Qatar include Theo Corbeanu, Luca Koleosho, and the aforementioned Buchanan. The question on many supporters’ minds is whether Herdman will put the 18-year-old dual national Koleosho into the game. While a single appearance in a friendly match will not cap tie the young prospect, it may reflect a statement of intent for his future.\n\nUruguay is a two-time World Cup winner in 1930 and 1950, albeit both times before the tournament required qualification processes for all participating teams, or experienced significant boycotts by leading footballing nations.\n\nOfficial - @Uruguay’s 26 players for the friendlies vs. Iran and Canada\n\n\n\n• Absences: Cavani and Josema\n\n• Additions: Rogel [DF, Hertha ], S. Cáceres [DF, America ] and Satriano [FW, Empoli ] pic.twitter.com/ctCjpKvhmE — Uruguay Football ENG (@UruguayFootENG) September 16, 2022\n\nThe current Uruguay roster is transitioning to a younger team with many of the mainstays from the past decade missing out this window, and some finding more time on the bench than on the pitch. Household names such as second all-time leading scorer Edinson Cavani, long-time captain and all-time caps leader Diego Godin and his oftentimes central defence partner José Giménez have been ruled out by injuries.\n\n.@valenciacf manager Gattuso has confirmed that Cavani will not join Uruguay for the upcoming friendlies vs. Iran and Canada pic.twitter.com/KTXrzjkGMf — Uruguay Football ENG (@UruguayFootENG) September 16, 2022\n\nHowever, veterans such as long-time goalkeeper Fernando Muslera, defender Martín Cáceres, who recently signed for the LA Galaxy, and all-time top scorer Luis Suárez are with the Uruguay squad. They will be supported by younger stars like strikers Darwin Núñez of Liverpool and Facundo Pellistri of Manchester United, and centre-back Ronald Araújo of Barcelona. Araújo, however, left the game with Iran early with an injury and is a doubt for the Canada game. The average age of the 23 outfield players for Uruguay this window is 26 years of age.\n\nThe real test for Les Rouges, as sought by Herdman, is with the Uruguay midfield. A source of strength for Uruguay no matter who they play in midfield, the straw that stirs the drink for the Uruguay midfield, is Federico Valverde. A rising star with his club Real Madrid, Valverde is a La Liga player of the month award nominee for September. Since the start of 2022, Uruguay tended to play with either a four or five man midfield, but its last two games have featured a midfield three.\n\nThe midfield battle with Uruguay is of particular interest to Herdman’s World Cup planning as Canada will face a pair of strong midfields in Belgium and Croatia in November. Missing Hutchinson and Osorio has thrown a wrench into Herdman’s planning. Nevertheless, it will be a test for the five midfielders called into this camp to provide a glimpse for Herdman to see what they might expect in the upcoming World Cup matches and to see which midfielders complement Stephen Eustáquio best should Hutchinson not be ready in November.\n\nCanada is coming off a comfortable 2-0 win over World Cup hosts Qatar on Friday September 23rd while Uruguay were surprised by Iran 1-0 that same day. Iran put on a tenacious defensive display against an overall superior Uruguay side, but made the most of their limited chances and scored on a late counter. The loss was current Uruguay manager Diego Alonso’s first taste of defeat with La Celeste.\n\n3 Keys to the Game\n\nHow will the Canadian defence hold up against a high-quality attack such as Uruguay? From the perspective of many observers Canada entered the Octagonal with a suspect back line but then came out with the qualifying tournament’s best defensive record. Not to belabour the obvious, but Uruguay is decidedly not another CONCACAF opponent. The midfield battle. How will Canada fare against Uruguay’s dominant midfield? This is as good a test as Herdman could ask for his midfield, even with Canada missing a few important pieces in Hutchinson and Osorio. Will Canada be able to contain Valverde and Bentancur? Canada’s stamina and ability to maintain their defensive shape will be crucial as time on the ball is not expected to be in Canada’s favour. Canada’s counter-attack. Can Canada’s speed on the wings and quickness in transition tip the balance in a game where possession will most certainly be ceded to Uruguay? Will Canada generate sufficient opportunities for its strength to show itself and make a difference?\n\nFor Canada to succeed against Uruguay, let alone Belgium and Croatia in November, the first two keys need to be executed to such a degree that it will allow the third key to be executed by the team’s stars.\n\nPredicted Line-ups\n\nCanada – 3-4-3: Milan Borjan; Kamal Miller, Steven Vitoria, Alistair Johnston - Samuel Adekugbe, Stephen Eustáquio, Samuel Piette, Theo Corbeanu – Alphonso Davies, Jonathan David, Cyle Larin.\n\nUruguay – 4-3-3: Sergio Rochet; Damián Suárez, Augustin Rogel, Sebastián Cáceres, Mathías Olivera - Federico Valverde, Matías Vecino, Rodrigo Bentancur - Facundo Pellistri, Luis Suárez, Darwin Núñez.",

Asheesh Moosapeta Aa Accessibility Font Style Serif\n\nSans Font Size A\n\nA\n\nThe Parents and Grandparents Program (PGP) allows parents and grandparents of Canadian permanent residents and citizens to immigrate to Canada, and experience the benefits of permanent residence (PR) and even citizenship; though it is less available than the Super Visa, due to its lottery system selection process, and once-a-year availability.\n\nSponsor your family for Canadian immigration\n\nThe Super Visa functions as a temporary resident visa (TRV) and allows parents and grandparents of Canadian PRs/citizens to enter and remain in Canada on a long-term basis (up to 10 years validity, with five years continuous stay). It is available year-round, but doesn’t provide parents/grandparents with the same options to PR and eventually citizenship, as the PGP.\n\nEligibility\n\nAt minimum, candidates hoping to sponsor their parents/grandparents through either program must be:\n\nAt least 18 years old;\n\nA Canadian citizen, or PR;\n\nResiding in Canada at the time of application and when parents/grandparents are expected to arrive;\n\nOf good financial standing;\n\nIneligibility\n\nIn addition to failure to comply with the eligibility criteria, candidates will also be ineligible for either program if they:\n\nDid not pay back an immigration loan, a performance bond, or court-ordered family support (i.e.: alimony or child support);\n\nDid not provide promised financial support they agreed to when sponsoring a family member in the past;\n\nFall under any other ineligibility criteria.\n\nFinancial requirements\n\nFor the Super Visa, candidates will have to prove that their household meets the required Low-Income Cut-Off (LICO) criteria.\n\nFor the PGP, candidates should look to meet the Minimum Necessary Income (MNI) requirements for the program. Candidates must show proof of funds by requesting a Notice of Assessment (NOA) from the Canadian Revenue Agency (CRA); showing that the sponsor has met the MNI for their case, and has done so for the last three taxation years, before applying.\n\nApplication process\n\nFor Super Visa sponsorship, the application process is similar to that of a regular TRV. Additional documentation is needed, however, to prove that parents/grandparents can be looked after, upon arriving in Canada.\n\nFor the PGP, candidates must follow the steps to meet and prove their eligibility, and then submit this information to be included in the candidate pool. If candidates are selected, they will receive an invitation to apply, which carries subsequent steps.\n\nFor either the PGP or the Super Visa, the sponsored individuals cannot be medically or criminally inadmissible to come to Canada. An Immigration Medical Exam (IME) is required for both programs, and the PGP also requires a police certificate.\n\nAvailability in Quebec\n\nBoth programs are available to Quebec residents and citizens as well, though there are added steps, including a unique MNI system (for both sponsor and the sponsored), and the need to obtain a Quebec Selection Certificate (CSQ).\n\nSponsor your family for Canadian immigration\n\n© CIC News All Rights Reserved.

    "International students' visa backlog due to an outdated system: lawyer": "An ongoing Canadian immigration backlog of 151,000 applications has left many international students at risk of missing their entire fall semesters altogether. Many schools are recommending they defer their semesters, effectively leaving these students in limbo.\n\nFederal data shows that, as of the end of July, 34 per cent of pending international student visa applications were taking longer to process than government standards dictate.\n\nImmigration lawyer Mario Bellissimo says a main cause of the backlog is an outdated immigration system that attempts to push a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to most applicants.\n\nWhile COVID-19 exacerbated the issue, the problem is more historical, Bellissimo told CTV’s Your Morning on Monday. Arguing that the system has been ‘slow to modernize,’ he advocates a more nuanced approach.\n\n“We need to have provincial specific study permit categories (and) better training and regulation of educational agents that are tracking these students to Canada,” he said.\n\nAccording to Bellissimo, the current immigration pathway of a one-to-four-year study permit, which often leads to a work permit for international students after graduation, doesn’t always guarantee a permanent residence. He says this needs to be made clear to applicants.\n\n“If you remove the one-size-fits-all (system), you'll have a more nuanced system, one that has caps and terminates when individuals can’t be processed in time,” he said, adding that this will allow students to move on.\n\nInternational students now make up almost 20 per cent of all students enrolled in post-secondary institutions in Canada, up from 7.2 per cent in 2010. This group is often considered a potential solution to the country’s aging workforce.\n\nBut, the path to steady employment and citizenship for them is paved with complicated immigration requirements and barriers to entry in many workforces, a report published earlier this month by RBC Economics and Thought Leadership has found.\n\n“For many, a Canadian education may not yield the desired return on investment,” the report stated.\n\nBellissimo says that there isn’t much that the students who are currently in the immigration backlog awaiting their visas can do.\n\n“It's very difficult to deliver a meaningful remedy to these students and so, a lot of their lives are being interrupted by this, and keep in mind when we're thinking about students, we're not just speaking about individuals coming for their first degree,” he said.\n\n“We're thinking about some accomplished students, some that have career experience, those that are coming with spouses and families.\n\nSo there's a lot of myth-busting that has to happen here. And, understanding how many lives this really impacts.”\n\nIn a statement to CTV’s Your Morning, the IRCC said that they are moving to a more “integrated, modernized and centralized working environment,” which is expected to help speed up application processing.\n\nBellissimo says that immigration systems in Canada need to leverage newer technology such as artificial intelligence if they plan to keep up with demand which, at the moment, outweighs supply.\n\nSo far this year, the IRCC has processed more than 360,000 study visas, a 17 per cent increase over the same period in 2021.\n\nThe High Commission of India in Ottawa said in a statement it was talking to Canadian universities about what can be done to accommodate the large number of Indian international students who are still waiting for visas.\n\nThe high commission said universities have also approached the immigration ministry with their concerns.\n\nSome institutions will provide a remote option for students unable to reach Canada at the start of the term because they have not yet received a visa.\n\n“We have to remain true to the principles of the program, which is really to draw in (the) future, potentially in some cases, future Canadians,” Bellissimo said.\n\n“You don't know who is in that backlog. Someone that may make a huge impact on Canada.”\n\nWith files from The Canadian Press",

And how does it help those operators who are recovering from the pandemic to stabilize and grow while bravely navigating new economic hardships? Firecircle – that's how.\n\nToday, Firecircle announced its latest project, Transition to Tourism Entrepreneurship, an intensive business development program founded on Firecircle's innovative 5x5 Method and customized to empower 1,000 tourism and hospitality entrepreneurs from across Canada to envision, launch and grow their best business ideas through a series of animated online and live video workshops, step-by-step guidance and expert, sustained mentorship. The new resources being prepared and delivered through the Transition to Tourism Entrepreneurship program are targeted at the needs of Indigenous, rural, Northern and Francophone entrepreneurs as well as entrepreneurs with disabilities seeking to start a business or recover their existing operations from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAccording to Destination Canada's latest reports, domestic tourism spending and activity have increased to near 2019 levels and demand for Indigenous and rural tourism is on the rise, both domestically and internationally. However, the tourism industry's small and medium sized businesses, who make up over 99% of tourism businesses in Canada, are still struggling to recover and repoint to meet that demand. Deneen Allen, CEO of Firecircle and one of Canada's leading sustainable tourism advisors, is passionate when she says, \"It is imperative that the entrepreneurial spirit and capacity of our tourism industry be supported with effective education and mentorship that create opportunities for new growth and future resiliency – that's where this exciting program comes in\".\n\nA full 500 of the 1,000 total participant seats in the Transition to Tourism Entrepreneurship program are being offered to Indigenous entrepreneurs, supported in partnership with the Indigenous Tourism Association of Canada (ITAC). \"This partnership will continue our efforts to return the Indigenous tourism industry to the historic levels of 2019. Firecircle will be an important partner in supporting aspiring Indigenous entrepreneurs on their journey to developing their business plans, helping the industry recover, and build resiliency from the impacts of the pandemic. We are excited to offer this program to our members, which supports The Original-Original Accreditation Program as a tool for businesses who need extra support,\" says Keith Henry, President and CEO of ITAC. A further 500 participant entrepreneurs will be invited to join the program from rural and Northern communities across the country.\n\nFirecircle is the only digital, mentored business accelerator platform for tourism and hospitality entrepreneurs in Canada. \"Firecircle launched in 2020 to inspire new - and strengthen existing - tourism and hospitality entrepreneurs.

    "Sudden die-off of endangered sturgeon alarms Canadian biologists": "When the first spindly, armour-clad carcass was spotted in the fast-flowing Nechako River in early September, Nikolaus Gantner and two colleagues scrambled out on a jet boat, braving strong currents to investigate the grim discovery.\n\nDays later, the remains of 10 others were spotted floating along a 100km stretch of the river in western Canada.\n\nIn total, 11 endangered white sturgeon have mysteriously died in a short period of time, blindsiding biologists, who are trying to save a fish teetering towards extinction.\n\nThe species has remained relatively unchanged in 200m years: toothless apex hunters that glide gracefully in a handful of British Columbia’s rivers. To navigate the murky waters, sturgeon gently brush whisker-like barbels that hang from their snout along the gravelly bottom.\n\nWhite sturgeon, with a torso clad in five distinct bony plates called scutes, look every inch a prehistoric fish. The largest ever recorded reached 20ft long and another, believed to be 104 years old, weighed nearly 1,800 lbs.\n\nThe Nechako River, where the sturgeon population has dropped from 5,000 to 500 in the past century. Photograph: Fernando Lessa/Alamy\n\n“When you see a massive head appearing through the murky water and the eyes look at you, it’s just incredible to see this majestic animal alive,” said Gantner, a senior fisheries biologist with the British Columbia government. “And you gain respect for it, knowing that most fish we see are older than us.”\n\nThe rapid succession of deaths has taken an unexpected emotional toll on Gantner and his colleagues.\n\n“I’m deeply saddened. These last couple of weeks, I feel like I’m going through grief,” he said. Each time he and colleagues tenderly move the hulking carcasses of the fish from the shore to the freezer and on to the necropsy table, he feels a pang of sorrow. “I don’t think I felt like that from other fish that I’ve worked with.”\n\nSo far, there are no obvious answers. The team hasn’t found any sign of trauma nor evidence of chemical exposure, disease, or angling-induced death.\n\n“Whatever it is, it affects larger sturgeon, not other species. It’s constrained to a place in time and space. So that gives us some clues,” said Steve McAdam, a biologist with the province’s ministry of land, water and resource stewardship. “In a way, it’s easier to rule a bunch of stuff out than to rule some things in.”\n\nThe deaths in the Nechako are particularly painful for McAdam, who studied a similar die-off in the lower Fraser River in 1993 and 1994, when the region lost 36 fish in two years.\n\nA battery of tests that followed that die-off was inconclusive, said McAdam; the events occurred in differing ecosystems, hundreds of kilometres apart, offering limited clues to investigators.\n\nBecause the team investigating the current episode has a narrow window of time to recover dead sturgeon before decomposition sets in and destroys valuable clues, they have appealed to the public for help. In a region where the fish have deep cultural ties to First Nations and are part of the curriculum in local schools, residents have paid close attention to the phenomenon.\n\nA range of theories have been suggested, including a belief that elevated water temperatures are to blame. But McAdam said previous hot summers had not triggered similar die-offs.\n\n“There’s no end to the ideas. There are some partial explanations, but we’re really trying to keep an open mind and not veer too far down one path,” he said.\n\nTo navigate in murky waters, sturgeon gently brush whisker-like barbels that hang from their snouts along the gravelly bottom. Photograph: Minden Pictures/Alamy\n\nBefore the mysterious die-offs, white sturgeon, which are listed as a federal species at risk, were already in trouble.\n\nOver the last century, the numbers in the Nechako River have dropped from more than 5,000 to only 500. Soon after a dam was built on the Nechako River in 1957, the species experienced what biologists call “recruitment failure” – new fish weren’t being added to the population.\n\nIt is from within that ageing population, already missing an entire generation of fish, that the 11 have died.\n\nOverfishing, drainage projects and dam construction have all contributed to the collapse. On all the rivers in the province where sturgeon once thrived, dams have crushed their populations. Only the Fraser River, the largest without a dam, has a relatively healthy sturgeon population in the tens of thousands.\n\nBritish Columbia has worked since 2001 to help the species recover, drawing teams of provincial and federal biologists, First Nations groups and the industries tied to sturgeon habitat loss, like hydroelectric dam operators.\n\nEfforts include using hatcheries, a “stopgap measure” to help the population recover, as well a longer-term goal of restoring habitat.\n\nBut the sudden death of 11 members of a species already spiralling towards demise mirrors a trend all over the world: sturgeon have become the most threatened genus of fish.\n\nAll of the 26 remaining species of sturgeon are now at risk of extinction. They are the victims of overfishing; in some species, like beluga sturgeon, the roe is prized as caviar. And the habitats they have persisted in are disappearing.\n\n“They are a quite a charismatic species and it’s a fish that has been around for millions of years. So you don’t take it lightly when it’s in danger,” McAdam said.\n\nThe abruptness with which the fish have died has puzzled biologists in part because white sturgeon have been closely studied and monitored for the last three decades, precisely because of their precarious situation.\n\n“And then within a week, this happens. We have a new huge question mark,” said Gantner. “It’s really blindsided us.”\n\nBoth Gantner and McAdam were hopeful that the deaths will serve a broader end, providing valuable insight to biologists into what might have happened – and how a similar outcome can be prevented in the future.\n\nBecause the other option – that they have already reached some kind of a tipping point – is too bleak to consider.\n\n“We’ve never done the experiment of eliminating them fully and seeing how truly important sturgeon are to an ecosystem,” said McAdam. “And personally, I don’t think we ever want to.”",

    "The Republic of Korea and Canada: Stronger Together - Joint Leaders’ Statement": "We, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and President Yoon Suk Yeol of the Republic of Korea (ROK), met today in Ottawa to celebrate and strengthen a vibrant friendship that is reflected in the depth and diversity of our ties.\n\nOn the eve of the 60th anniversary of the Canada-ROK diplomatic relationship in 2023, we acknowledge that ours is a special friendship forged together through war, people-to-people ties, a mutual commitment to multilateralism, the rules-based international order and global commerce, and sustained by a shared spirit of innovativeness, creativity, and entrepreneurship.\n\nCanada and the ROK have long been like-minded partners on matters of peace and stability. Canada stood with the ROK through the Korean War, defending not only its people but also the international order we were building, made real in the United Nations. Since then, we have been working together to protect and strengthen democracy, security, and human rights, including the rights of women and girls, in the region and around the world. We reiterate our common objective of the complete denuclearization of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). President Yoon explained the ROK’s Audacious Initiative and Prime Minister Trudeau expressed his strong support for President Yoon’s efforts to achieve a denuclearized, peaceful and prosperous Korean Peninsula.\n\nOur peoples have built strong ties, too. Many Canadians and Koreans live, work, and study across their borders, creating vibrant communities, families, and businesses, becoming an essential part of our cultural fabric, and making our friendship stronger. Similarly, many of our students have lived or studied in each other’s world-class universities, creating a strong network of friends between Canada and the ROK.\n\nOur long friendship, highlighted by the establishment of the Canadian embassy in Korea in 1973 and the Korean embassy in Canada in 1965, was more recently reinforced when we established the Canada-ROK Strategic Partnership and subsequently signed the Canada-ROK Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and Science, Technology, and Innovation (ST&I) Cooperation Agreement. These agreements have been an important part of our lasting friendship, increasing trade and economic prosperity for both of our countries and facilitating collaboration between our most innovative researchers, scientists, and entrepreneurs.\n\nNow more than ever, Canada and the ROK – Canadians and Koreans – are ready to modernize our bilateral relationship and to advance, through joint action, the values that we share. Today, we are upgrading our bilateral relationship to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, based on the following five shared priorities in the areas of values, security, prosperity, sustainability, and beyond.\n\nDefending the Rules Based International System, Democracy, Freedom, Human Rights, and Gender Equality\n\nStrengthening Security and Defense Partnerships, including Peacekeeping and Maritime Security\n\nEnhancing Economic Prosperity and Security, Cooperating on Supply Chains, Critical Minerals, and ST&I, and Promoting Trade and Investment\n\nAddressing Climate Change and the Environment, Supporting Energy Security, and Developing Sustainable Energy Sources\n\nDeepening Partnerships in Health and Culture\n\nTo begin implementing our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, we are pleased to jointly welcome the creation of the new annual Canada-ROK Climate Change Dialogue, the renewal of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on Defence Materials Cooperation between the ROK Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) and the Canadian Department of National Defence (DND), and the renewal of the MOU on Industrial Technology and Innovation Partnership between the Korea Institute for Advanced Technology (KIAT) and the National Research Council Canada (NRC).\n\nToday, we agreed to work towards launching a high-level dialogue on economic security involving the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Industry. Reflecting the increasingly important nexus between economic interests and security, we also commit to address economic security challenges through enhanced cooperation and coordination. This includes deepening our strategic partnership on supply chain resiliency. We will seek to position both countries as globally competitive players in the critical minerals supply chain and battery and EV (Electric Vehicles) value chains in ways that support our collective prosperity and security, while raising labour and environmental standards. To that end, we agreed on the need to develop an MOU in the coming months to enable the building of value chains in Canada and Korea to support clean energy transition and energy security, including with respect to critical minerals. We also agreed on the need to strengthen the bilateral Joint Committee on Science, Technology, and Innovation (ST&I).\n\nWe are also committed to strengthening ST&I cooperation in emerging technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence (AI), and next generation network beyond 5G) and exploring future opportunities for bilateral collaboration on AI while seeking to identify mechanisms to drive collaborative innovation for the benefit of all citizens. Furthermore, recognizing the importance of ensuring mutual economic prosperity, we commit to seeking opportunities to grow bilateral trade and investment to ensure the creation of well-paying jobs in both economies.\n\nWe note with appreciation the contributions made by our Working Holiday Program to promoting people-to-people exchanges and will continue to explore avenues for its renewal. In recognition of the upcoming 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Canada and the ROK, we have designated 2024-2025 as the Year of Cultural Exchanges between Canada and the ROK.\n\nDuring the 60th anniversary of our diplomatic relations next year, and as we strengthen cooperation through our forthcoming Indo-Pacific strategies, we look forward to working together on several important initiatives under our shared priorities to fully implement the Canada-Korea Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.\n\nExpressing his gratitude for Prime Minister Trudeau’s warm welcome and hospitality, President Yoon extended, and the Prime Minister accepted with gratitude, a sincere invitation to visit the ROK, an occasion that promises to mark yet another leap in the bilateral relations upon the 60th anniversary.",

    "World Cup expectations for Canada? Dwayne De Rosario sets the record straight": "Could that all work for Les Rouges rather than against them, though? MLS legend Dwayne De Rosario, second in all-time goals (22) for Canada, sure thinks so as the country’s first World Cup appearance in 36 years rapidly approaches.\n\n“I'm interested to see how we adapt to playing against teams in a World Cup environment, something that we're very immature [with], something that we're very inexperienced in and how we handle our emotions and how we play,” De Rosario said in an Extratime 1-on-1 interview.\n\n“Now, that could benefit us though because when you're playing against Belgium, Morocco and Croatia, they're going in thinking 'Canada? Come on. We got this.' If we can sneak an early goal and be up and hold it, it could be pretty interesting.\"\n\nSetting expectations\n\nCroatia and Belgium finished second and third, respectively, at the 2018 World Cup in Russia. World superstars like Manchester City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne and Real Madrid midfielder Luka Modric are among their ranks, too. Morocco won’t be an easy opponent either, a perennial contender in the African Cup of Nations that counts Paris Saint-Germain defender Achraf Hakimi as their superstar.\n\nThey’re all “world-class teams,” as De Rosario noted. And they represent a step up in competition for head coach John Herdman’s team, which finished ahead of traditional regional leaders Mexico and the United States during Concacaf’s Octagonal qualifying pathway.\n\nSo, where should expectations be when Group F play unfolds from Nov. 23 to Dec. 1?\n\n“I'm going to be very honest: It's a tough group,” said the 2011 Landon Donovan MLS MVP. “If we scrape and get out of that group, that's a huge success. I'm just happy the fact we're there and we're having the conversation of Canada being in the World Cup first and foremost.",
    "Canada: Why ERs are struggling to stay open nationwide": "Data over the last five years shows people are waiting longer in the ER before they are either seen by a doctor or admitted to hospital. Nearly five million Canadians don't have a family doctor, often making an emergency room their primary place to get help if they need it.",
    "Mounties’ missteps creating crisis of confidence in Canada’s police": "Hours after the arrest earlier this month of a fugitive wanted in connection with the stabbing deaths of 11 people, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police hastily called a press conference to announce that Myles Sanderson was “no longer a threat” to the public.\n\nBut as RCMP assistant commissioner Rhonda Blackmore described the four-day manhunt, she omitted a critical detail: Sanderson, who had been taken into custody alive, was already dead.\n\nIt was nearly five minutes after announcing his arrest that Blackmore added that Sanderson had died after he went into “medical distress” and was transported to hospital.\n\nReporters covering the press conference were in disbelief. “I have never seen a more egregious case of burying the lede,” tweeted Siobhan Morris of CTV News.\n\nAfter two mass killings in two years – both among the worst in the country’s history –the institutional opaqueness of Canada’s national police force has once again become the focus of criticism. These public communication fumbles – and a troubled legacy of scandals, lawsuits and policing failures – have renewed longstanding questions over the force’s structure.\n\nIn the days since Sanderson’s death, questions over police actions and communication with the public have continued to mount. National media have repeatedly pressed the force after the police said they would not release autopsy results.\n\nAnd it emerged that – despite the fact that earlier in the summer an arrest warrant had been issued for Sanderson on unrelated charges – police do not appear to have been searching for him until he launched his stabbing spree on 4 September.\n\n“In many ways, the RCMP has lurched from crisis to crisis,” said Kent Roach, professor of law at the University of Toronto.\n\nPolice have not publicly speculated on what triggered the eruption of violence in which Sanderson killed 10 people aged between 23 and 78 in the James Smith Cree Nation, an Indigenous community in northern Saskatchewan, and the neighbouring village of Weldon.\n\nAfter the attacks, Sanderson remained at large for four days, with local communities on edge amid a string of false sightings.\n\nAs officers searched for Sanderson, the RCMP was itself the subject of a sprawling public inquiry over its response to another mass killing on the other side of the country, when a lone gunman shot and killed 22 people over the course of 12 hours in rural Nova Scotia.\n\nThe RCMP commissioner, Brenda Lucki, speaks with victims’ family members at an event after the mass stabbing at James Smith Cree Nation, Saskatchewan. Photograph: Heywood Yu/AP\n\nIn that case, police failed to send an emergency alert warning locals of the ongoing threat, and waited 12 hours to alert the public that the suspect was driving a fake police car. The public inquiry heard that two victims died in the time it took Canadian police to get internal approval to tweet a warning to the public about the suspect.\n\nAs the commission wrapped up this week, lawyer Sarah McCullough, who represents most of the 22 victims’ families, said the RCMP demonstrated it was fundamentally untrained, unprepared and unequipped for a major mass killing in a rural area.\n\nDuring the Saskatchewan attack, multiple alerts were sent out to warn residents of the threat. The RCMP also worked closely with local police forces, something they were criticized for not doing in Nova Scotia.\n\n“We definitely saw some improvements in their general communications in Saskatchewan, but it is disturbing there has not been more information about how Mr Sanderson died,” said Roach, author of the recent book Canadian Policing: Why and How It Must Change.\n\nOn Wednesday, Saskatchewan’s chief coroner announced that two inquests – for the stabbing victims and Myles Sanderson – would be launched in the spring.\n\n“With the suspect deceased, there will not be a public criminal trial. Without a public hearing of the facts, it will leave many questions unanswered from the families involved and the public pertaining to the circumstances leading to the deaths,” chief coroner Clive Weighill said in a statement.\n\nA jury in the inquest will only be able to establish fact, not guilt, but can also issue recommendations.\n\n“It is my intention to have the jury wholly comprised of Indigenous persons,” said Weighill.\n\nDue to a quirk of Canadian policing, the RCMP oversees both federal criminal law enforcement as well as operating contract police services to most provinces and municipalities. Only Ontario, Quebec and Newfoundland have their own police forces. But even in Newfoundland, the RCMP handles much of the rural policing.\n\nPeople hold candles at a vigil remembering the stabbing victims in front of City Hall in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. Photograph: Canadian Press/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nBut that system is once again under scrutiny after the Saskatchewan murders, which highlightedthe RCMP’s deficiencies in rural areas and First Nations. The force has only one officer dedicated to policing the 2,400 residents of James Smith Cree Nation.\n\nIn wake of the Saskatchewan attack, the James Smith Cree Nation has discussed creating its own police force to better address the needs of First Nation residents.\n\nThe challenges of enforcing the law on Canada’s rural regions was underlined in 2019 when two teenage murder suspects eluded capture for weeks as they fled into the forested wilds of northern Manitoba. Police only found their bodies after deploying aircraft, heat-sensing technology and dog teams.\n\n“The reality of policing of sparsely populated rural areas is something that Canada really needs to grapple with,” said Roach, who has called for a substantial overhaul of the force. “How much are Canadians willing to pay for policing of these communities?”",
    "How age is a big factor for immigration applicants to Canada": "Canada is credited for having one of the world’s most immigrant-friendly policies, ranking fourth internationally in the Migrant Integration Policy Index. But the criteria used to prioritize applicants based on age leaves many at a disadvantage, even though they might have the qualifications Canada is looking for.\n\nWith immigration backlogs and several technical glitches on the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) online portal during the pandemic, many have become ineligible for certain programs that consider age as a criterion.\n\nWhen Pedro Carvalho arrived with his wife in 2017 from Brazil, the couple was in their 30s.\n\nBut after missing the Express Entry (EE) draw this year because of a technical glitch, Carvalho was skeptical about meeting the CRS cut-off score due to his age.\n\nAfter the resumption of EE draws in July 2022, the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score has been on the higher end (above 500 points) in comparison to pre-pandemic levels, touching 557 on July 6th.\n\nWith high cut-off scores at the time, many like Carvalho were pessimistic and switched to another program called temporary resident to permanent resident program (TR to PR) to ensure they can stay in Canada as permanent residents.\n\n“Now I turned 40, so I lost points. To be honest I don't know what else I can say,” Carvalho said in an email to CTVNews.ca in August.\n\nRick Lamanna, director at Fragomen Canada, an immigration services provider, told CTVNews.ca in a phone interview that it can be frustrating for certain applicants waiting in the pool.\n\n“They see themselves losing points every year because of these delays. They may have fewer points than they did a couple of years ago or even a year ago,” he said.\n\nAt first glance, age is not highlighted as a major criterion by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).\n\nBut for certain programs—such as the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP) or Canadian Experience Class (CEC)— the importance of being young becomes quite explicit, especially for applicants touching the 40s threshold.\n\nA DEEPER LOOK AT THE POINT-BASED SYSTEM\n\nPrograms under EE include the FSWP, Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP), CEC, and a portion of the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP). An applicant needs to be eligible for one of the above to enter the EE pool of candidates.\n\nCanadian employers typically rely on EE designed to attract highly skilled foreign workers through its programs that lead to permanent residency (PR) and among these, FSWP, and the CEC are popular—both of which consider age as one of the core/human capital factors.\n\nLamanna says, while age can drop the score of a CEC or FSWP candidate, other factors can help raise CRS scores.\n\n“However,” he said, “It is very difficult. Because applicants in their 40s lose a lot of points on age relative to people in their 20s or 30s.”\n\nCRS is a points-based system that scores a profile to rank applicants in the Express Entry pool. To get an invitation to apply (ITA), the candidate should meet a score above the CRS score.\n\nThe maximum score in CRS is 1200 and this evaluation is based on several characteristics such as level of education, English/French skills, and work experience. If an applicant doesn't meet the CRS score in a specific draw, he/she has to upload their profile again to be considered for the next pool.\n\nPOINT DROP FOR OLDER APPLICANTS\n\nUnder the CRS score, candidates can get a higher score if they are single and fall under the Express Entry category. However, the score falls dramatically for those above the age of 44. Canada’s comprehensive ranking system gives no points to those above 45 years of age.\n\nNot only that, starting from the age of 40, the points reduce by 10 versus 5 before the age of 40. While a 29-year-old can get a maximum of 110 CRS points for age, an applicant of a similar caliber approaching their 30th birthday may see a sharp decline. By the time they reach 39, just 55 points are available, and by the time they reach 45, there are no points.\n\nUnder FSWP, the applicant’s age is worth 12 per cent of the overall selection criteria on the selection grid. The FAQ section makes it clear that someone over the age of 47 will not get any points under the Age factor of the CRS, but may get points on other factors such as job offer, skills, and language abilities.\n\nDOES CANADA NEED YOUNG WORKERS?\n\nImmigration has played a critical role in Canada’s economy, providing a relatively young stream of workers. More than 80% of the immigrants admitted in recent years have been under 45 years old.\n\nAccording to a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), young immigrants are generally much more educated than immigrants nearing retirement and this is true for those entering the labour force.\n\nWith an aging native-born labour force and low fertility rates (roughly 1.4 births per woman in 2020), an inflow of immigrants has become increasingly important for Canada. The country suffers a shortage of skilled workers despite attempts to attract immigrants. According to the data from Statistics Canada, immigrants account for a little over one-quarter of Canadian workers.\n\nRecent census data from 2021 shows that people nearing retirement outnumber those who are too old to enter the labour market in Canada. Additionally, rural populations are also aging faster than those in urban areas – partially due to the lower influx of immigrants.\n\nThe Canadian population is seeing a big shift, with baby boomers getting older, according to a report by Statistics Canada. The shift will have significant consequences on the labour market, services to seniors, and the consumption of goods and services.\n\nA recent Census report by Statistics Canada shows that young immigrants are helping boost numbers in Canada’s population growth. Millennials (born between 1981 and 1996) were between 25 and 40 years old in 2021, and are already the fastest-growing generation. In Canada, their numbers rose 8.6 per cent between 2016 and 2021 due to immigration, according to the StatsCan report.\n\nBut when it comes to the age factor in economic immigration, Canada is not alone.\n\nAustralia has age as one of the selection criteria for permanent residency and the age of the applicant should be below 45 years to apply for a PR visa. Germany recently introduced its version of the “green card” (known as Chancenkarte) to meet the country’s growing labour shortage. Three of the four criteria to be considered for the program include that applicant is below the age of 35.\n\nBUT TARGETED DRAWS IN 2023 COULD BE A GAMECHANGER\n\nLamanna says as 2023 approaches, applicants need to brace themselves for specified targeted draws, which are designed to address the labour shortage that Canada currently faces in certain sectors.\n\nThe recently passed Bill C-19 allows invitations to those applicants under Express Entry that support the regional economic needs. The training, education, experience, and responsibilities (TEER) system would allow IRCC to invite applicants based on occupation, language or education rather than the traditional CRS score.\n\n“While the issue of age is currently important, a bigger issue will be what happens when targeted draws occur,” he said. If someone is not in the pool of that specific occupation type, then applicants may be left in limbo and these could include those with higher CRS scores.\n\nLamanna said provinces have more autonomy in selecting people in certain occupations to help employers in certain jurisdictions. There is a risk-reward to targeted draws. It helps meet the labour shortage in specific industries such as health care, manufacturing and construction.\n\n“The risk is there are people in the queue who know that at some point, they will be selected as long as they meet the CRS score. But if a minister shifts to occupation-based selective selection process, then people may be left wondering when their turn will come next,” Lamanna said.",

    "No ‘Rah-Rah Canada’ for Amazon Studios: Streamer On the Hunt for Half-Hour Formats That Aren’t Uber-Canadian": "Amazon Studios wants to beef up its content library in Canada. And the quickest way to do that, according to Brent Haynes, the studio’s head of originals in Canada, is with half-hour formats.\n\n“With the exception of ‘Three Pines,’ we are doing half-hours and that’s because they help quickly build our library. But, that is also one of the gaps in our programming,” Haynes said recently during a Content Canada session in Toronto.\n\n“A lot of our other territories are doing one-hours and crime dramas, so we don’t need to repeat that,” he continued. “We are aware of what’s coming out around the world and we try to each make something that would help our other territories.”\n\nIn order to achieve that robust library, Haynes revealed the goal is to have anywhere from 5 to 10 shows in development at a time. “In our minds, every single one of those is going to go,” he said. “We’re not naïve to think they all will, because they fall apart and our needs change. But we’re finding because we love it, we want to make it.”\n\nSpecifically, Haynes is looking for local and unique stories that have a global appeal. What he’s not looking for are limited series or shows that are “hyper-localized” and inaccessible to mass audiences.\n\n“We want a unique Canadian perspective on everything,” he explained. “We’re not trying to tell stories that are rah-rah Canada, or are uber-Canadian, or check boxes that say, ‘This is what’s Canadian.’ But we do want something that we feel is unique to the territory,” he continued.\n\n“It has to hit a bar and that bar is really, really high. We know most Prime customers sign up for their free package delivery. But there’s still an expectation that they’re paying for this service. There has to be some sort of premium element to it,” said Haynes.\n\nThe executive added the general Amazon Studios model is to work backwards in terms of starting with data that models what its customers are looking for and then figuring out how to fill in those gaps.\n\n“We’re looking to make shows that Canadians will watch based on the research and the amount of data,” he said. “The strategy isn’t to just take great pitches, which we will, but we also want pitches in this area because we know this is what we need. The strategy is to find the best of the best.”\n\nThis past April, Amazon Studios Canada revealed a slate of Canadian original productions including the return of “The Kids in the Hall” and a companion docuseries, an adult animation series called “Gary and His Demons,” comedy drama series “The Sticky,” and the aforementioned “Three Pines” starring Alfred Molina and based on the book series by Louise Penny.\n\nChristina Wayne, who played a key role in the development of the Canadian originals strategy since joining the company in 2019, left her role as head of Canadian originals earlier this month to pursue other interests. Haynes joined the company as head of scripted series in May 2021 and was promoted this past August.\n\nHaynes was one of several executives on hand during the two-day Content Canada event, which also boasted Spotlight Stage sessions with Paramount+, Tubi Originals and Disney Plus. Netflix Canada took the stage for a session with director of Canadian series Danielle Woodrow and manager of Canadian series Tara Woodbury; however, it was closed to press.",

    "Will Canada cut ties to the monarchy under King Charles?

But a lot has changed since then.\n\nTHE CANADIAN PRESS\n\nIn 1982, Canada adopted a newly written Constitution that included the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the recognition of aboriginal treaty rights and a home-grown means of amending the Constitution in Canada without the involvement of British parliament.\n\nCanada also retired the old red ensign that included the Union Jack and raised the red-and-white flag featuring the maple leaf in 1965. Nonetheless, Canada remains a constitutional monarchy and not a constitutional republic despite these American-style moves toward independence.\n\nLoyal to the British monarchy\n\nCanada’s evolution as a modern state centred on its loyalty to the British Crown, a clear alternative to the American experiment as a democratic republic nearly a century earlier.\n\nThe American Revolution was premised on an explicit, violent rejection of the Crown in favour of a presidential form of government. Whatever its problems and failings, it was a great moment of human innovation.\n\nBut despite staying loyal to the Crown, Canada would begin to drift away from the old British model 100 years later.\n\nThe year 2022 is a possible inflection point as the long reigning and personally popular Queen Elizabeth is succeeded by her less popular eldest son.\n\nFor Americans, this may be a celebrity story first and foremost. But for Canadians, Australians, New Zealanders and other citizens of Commonwealth countries, the monarchy is tied to their system of government, symbolic representation and identity.\n\nCutting ties in the Caribbean\n\nThe recent decision by the Caribbean island of Barbados to abandon the monarchy and become a republic likely portends similar outcomes in Jamaica, Antigua and Barbuda and elsewhere in the region.\n\nEven in the U.K., support for the monarchy has been declining for decades, although the majority still support it. According to some sources, younger Britons in particular are losing faith in the monarchy and leaning toward republicanism.\n\nSome commentators suggest with good reason that abandoning the monarchy in Canada would be all but impossible as a constitutional question, though all bets would obviously be off if the U.K. dumped the monarchy first.\n\nWhile the United States comes to grips with its authoritarian tendencies and the rise of white nationalism, Canada and other Commonwealth countries are increasingly focused on race relations, in particular the role of the Crown in relation to the transatlantic slave trade, imperialism and the treatment of Indigenous Peoples.\n\nThese issues all pertain to the historical role of the Crown and the British monarch in the fundamental legitimacy of our states and legal orders. Although Canada didn’t fight a revolutionary war for a republican form of government like the U.S. did, it’s moved closer to an American, republican model of government and further from the British one over the course of its legal, political and constitutional history.\n\nBreaks from the Crown\n\nCanada’s first break with the Crown occurred in 1867 when it became an independent dominion and adopted a division of powers between the founding provinces and the federal Parliament in Ottawa. The second major break was almost 100 years later, when it patriated the Constitution in 1982.\n\nWhile it’s true Canada retained the British hereditary monarch as its head of state in both 1867 and 1982, that doesn’t mean it has to do the same in the 21st century.\n\nGranted, Canada has not held a referendum on transitioning to a constitutional republic as Australia did in 1999 when citizens opted to maintain ties to the Crown. But the recent decision by Barbados to ditch the monarchy suggests that the global decolonization process is ongoing and that anti-imperial ideology has teeth across the region.\n\nCanadians, Australians and New Zealanders who are the descendants of slaves or Indigenous Peoples have likely been inspired by these developments. Those sentiments will only intensify now that the popular Queen has died.\n\nCanada’s particular reckoning with the role of the Catholic Church, the Church of England and the Crown itself in residential schools and colonial genocide makes the Royal Family’s attributes of continuity and tradition seem like strange reasons to keep them around.\n\nRead more: Not in the past: Colonialism is rooted in the present\n\nTime to reflect on Canada’s future\n\nThe death of Queen Elizabeth and the ascension of King Charles should present a moment of reflection for Canada, especially as Caribbean Commonwealth nations begin to abandon the monarchy.\n\nThe world admired the Queen. But whatever her personal qualities, it’s time to determine how the monarchy aligns with Canada’s current situation as an independent country and its aspirations for the future, especially if it wants to take itself seriously as a modern, 21st century nation focused on reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples.\n\nTHE CANADIAN PRESS/Darren Calabrese\n\nAs a matter of constitutional law, unanimity of all provincial legislatures and both houses of federal Parliament would be required to remove the monarchy from its place at the heart of our formal and symbolic constitutional order.\n\nIt would also likely require a referendum in each province before any of the provincial legislatures or Parliament would take such a vote.\n\nThat would be difficult, and probably wouldn’t succeed on the first or even second try, but it’s hardly impossible. Opinion polls suggest that although a majority of Canadians admired the Queen, only about half are in any way committed to the monarchy as an institution.\n\nYounger, more diverse and Indigenous citizens may begin demanding a country in their own image, a country that belongs not only to those who settled it but to those there long before then — and those choosing to make it their home today.",

    "Advocates urge Canada to grant permanent status to migrants": "Rights groups say permanent status will help prevent abuse and allow foreign workers in Canada to defend their rights.\n\nMontreal, Canada – Migrant rights advocates in Canada have renewed their push for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau‘s government to grant permanent residency to all foreign workers, students and other undocumented people in the country when parliament resumes next week.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Wednesday during a virtual news briefing, undocumented worker and rights activist Danilo De Leon said he and others without status “cannot wait” any longer.\n\n“My daughters are the reason I continue to sacrifice, being far from them and fighting for my status. I want to be reunited with them in Canada so they will have a better future … We cannot wait, make status for all a priority now. No one should be excluded,” said De Leon.\n\nOrganised by the Migrant Rights Network, the news conference comes just days before rallies will be held across Canada to demand permanent status for all – a call that has been gaining momentum among civil rights activists for months.\n\nWhile regularising the immigration status of workers and others without permanent status has been a long-standing demand, it gained increased urgency as the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted systemic problems in several industries employing these labourers.\n\nRights groups estimate that more than one million migrant workers, students, refugees and others are in Canada without permanent immigration status, while hundreds of thousands of others are undocumented.\n\nMany work as domestic caregivers, in healthcare or custodial jobs, or in Canada’s highly profitable agricultural and food processing sector. And activists say a system that ties many of these workers to their Canadian employers leaves them vulnerable to abuse and with little recourse to defend their rights because the threat of removal hangs over their hands.\n\n“These migrants often hold poorly paid, precarious jobs with little or no social protection. [They] find themselves at the mercy of placement agencies, which too often place them in situations of exploitation,” Amnesty International Canada said in a report (PDF) on Wednesday. “Their rights as employees are generally not respected, but they don’t dare denounce the situation because of the precariousness of their status.”\n\nLast month, Jamaican farmworkers brought to Canada under a special, temporary migration programme said in an open letter that they are “treated like mules”, and verbally abused and threatened by their bosses. “As it currently stands, [the Seasonal Agricultural Worker Program] is systematic slavery,” they said.\n\nJamaica has since said it plans to send a special, fact-finding team to Canada to investigate the workers’ claims.\n\nPathways to residency\n\nThe Canadian government has said it is looking into pathways to permanent residence for foreign workers and international students.\n\nThe office of Canada’s Minister of Employment Carla Qualtrough also told Al Jazeera in an email last month that the government in 2021 set aside $38.1m ($49.5m Canadian) over three years to boost support for migrant workers.\n\n“In the last year, we have strengthened the workplace inspection process, expanded the TFW [temporary foreign worker] tip line to provide services in multiple languages, and are increasing support for migrant worker organizations,” it said, among other measures.\n\nIn 2020, Ottawa also announced a regularisation programme for so-called “guardian angels” – temporary workers who were on the front lines of Canada’s coronavirus response, including those who worked in hard-hit elderly care facilities at the height of the pandemic.\n\nBut advocates say that measure did not go far enough, and they argue permanent status for all is the best way to help all workers defend their rights and access services.\n\nTemporary migrants can lose their status for many reasons, including “if they leave a job for any reason such as unpaid wages, sexual harassment, or unsafe working conditions”, sociology professors Luin Goldring and Patricia Landolt at York University and the University of Toronto, respectively, wrote last year in The Conversation.\n\n“Status for all centres human rights, mobility rights and decent work — for all temporary migrants with precarious legal status and their families, not just workers in some sectors or occupations,” they said.\n\nHundreds of civil society groups have endorsed the call for status for all (PDF), while the editorial board of the Toronto Star, Canada’s largest newspaper, also recently urged the government “to take a generous approach and avoid arbitrary limits on who could apply” for permanent status.\n\n“Given the perils they face, these residents are exactly the sort of people governments should be seeking to protect,” the board wrote last week.\n\nDay of action\n\nOn Sunday, just days before Canada’s parliament resumes in Ottawa, rallies will be held in Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver and several other cities across the country to demand permanent status for all.\n\nOrganisers say they hope public pressure will get the government to act now.\n\n“We’re not asking for charity; we are demanding equality,” Syed Hussan, executive director of the Migrant Workers Alliance for Change advocacy group, said during Wednesday’s news conference.\n\nHe pointed to Ireland, which in early 2022 launched a regularisation programme for undocumented migrants who have lived in the country for at least two years, as one recent positive example that Canada should follow.\n\n“Prime Minister Trudeau has shown that he is ready to do the right thing,” Hussan said. “We are all here to insist that absolutely each and every undocumented person should be included – no one left behind.”",

It allows international student graduates to work anywhere in Canada for up to three years.\n\nSchedule a Free Work Permit Consultation with the Cohen Immigration Law Firm\n\nA major benefit of the PGWP is that it provides international graduates with professional work experience in Canada, which is helpful when PGWP holders go on to apply for Canadian immigration. In general, a PGWP holder needs to gain one year of professional work experience in a National Occupation Classification (NOC) code of 0, A or B to then be eligible to apply for a Canadian permanent residence program.\n\nWhat are the PGWP’s eligibility requirements?\n\nTo be eligible for a PGWP, international students must have:\n\nCompleted studies in an academic, vocational or professional training program that is at least eight months long at an eligible Designated Learning Institution (DLI)\n\nCompleted a study program that led to a degree, diploma or certificate\n\nHeld full time student status in Canada during every academic session of the program of study and included as part of their post-graduation work permit application\n\nObtained a transcript and an official letter from the DLI confirming the applicant has met all requirements to complete their program of study\n\nThe student must also have graduated from:\n\na public post-secondary institution, such as\n\na college\n\na trade or technical school\n\na university\n\nCEGEP (in Quebec)\n\na private post-secondary school (in Quebec) that operates under the same rules as public schools in Quebec;\n\na private secondary or post-secondary school (in Quebec) that offers qualifying programs of 900 hours or longer and results in the issuance of a diplôme d’études professionnelles (DEP) or an attestation de spécialisation professionnelle (ASP); (Note: this will no longer be in effect starting September 2023) or;\n\nCanadian private school that can award degrees under provincial law (for example, Associate, Bachelor’s, Master’s or Doctorate degree) but only if the student was enrolled in a study program that leads to a degree as authorized by the province.\n\nHow long is a PGWP valid for?\n\nA PGWP will be valid for between eight months and three years, depending on the length of the students’ study program. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) provides the following guidelines on its website:\n\nCompleted program under eight months: Not eligible for a PGWP\n\nCompleted program between eight months and less than two years: The PGWP will be valid for the same length of your study program (e.g., a 10-month program will result in a 10-month PGWP)\n\nCompleted program of two years or more: PGWP will be valid for three years\n\nCompleted more than one program: You may be able to combine your Canadian educational programs to get a PGWP as long as the programs are DLI eligible and each over eight months in duration.

In order to be eligible for this policy, the student must:\n\nBe enrolled at a DLI\n\nHave started or will start a program between spring 2020 and summer 2022, or the program was already in progress by March 2020.\n\nHave a study permit or approval for a study permit, or apply for a study permit prior to starting your program and are eventually approved\n\nMeet all other PGWP criteria\n\nPermanent Residency for International Residents\n\nUnder Express Entry, the Canadian government uses the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) to evaluate each candidate based on their human capital. Canada looks at age, education, language skills, work experience, among other criteria. Usually every two weeks, the Canadian government holds Express Entry draws providing permanent residence invitations to those with the highest CRS scores. Extra points are given to candidates with Canadian education and work experience under Express Entry.\n\nMany international students obtain permanent residence status through the Canadian Experience Class (CEC). With a PGWP, students must go on to obtain at least 1,560 hours of Canadian work experience in a NOC 0, A or B job in order to be apply for permanent residency through CEC. Many Provincial Nominee Programs also cater to international graduates.\n\nIf you have studied in Quebec and would like to settle in the province permanently, a student may also be eligible for immigration under the Quebec Experience Program (PEQ).

Through the fund, the UN and partner nations will assist the HNP to improve its administration/logistics, train police, and strengthen operational capacity to counter gang violence in Haiti.\n\nThe mounting insecurity should be addressed with urgency to help Haiti move towards stability and sustainable development. A holistic approach is needed to re-establish security, encompassing measures to strengthen the HNP and initiatives to successfully address the socioeconomic drivers of violence, as Haiti remains one of the poorest countries in the world, with significant structural impediments to sustainable development.\n\nCanada and the United States commend the international community for mobilizing more than $294 million in new commitments since December 2021 to support Haiti’s most pressing needs. In these very challenging times for the Haitian people, we are convinced that international partners should redouble our efforts to help the Government of Haiti ensure citizen security and improve conditions on the ground. We urge partner nations to contribute to the UN Basket Fund to restore peace and citizen security for the Haitian people.

    "Canada Criticized For Welcoming The Rich Linked To Iranian Regime": "A Canadian journalist has criticized Ottawa for spreading a “lush welcome mat” for rich Iranians linked to the regime but refusing visas to relatives of Flight PS752 victims.\n\nIn an article published by the National Post Wednesday, author and journalist Terry Glavin said Ottawa has allowed an Iranian vice president’s son to live and work in British Columbia while refusing visas to relatives of Iranian victims of Ukraine Airlines Flight PS752.\n\nThe flight was shot down by the Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) missiles in January 2020, and relatives of those killed in the tragic event wanted go to Canada for memorial services. Ontario's Superior Court of Justice has ruled that IRGC’s downing of the flight was intentional.\n\nIn his article Glavin referred to frequent visits of high-ranking former Revolutionary Guards officials such as former police chief of Tehran, Morteza Talaei, and former brigadier-general Alireza Razm-Hosseini, in the past few years and said Razm-Hosseini was “free to wander Canada’s streets as though Ottawa and Tehran were on intimate speaking terms.”\n\n“Allowing Talaei to freely enter Canada sends a dangerous message; a message that is an affront to Iranians who have themselves sought refuge in Canada,” several human rights groups said in an open letter in February.\n\nCanada broke off diplomatic relations with Iran in 2012, citing its support for the Syrian government, non-compliance with United Nations resolutions over the nuclear program, and fears for Canadian diplomats after protestors stormed the British embassy.\n\nOver the past five years, the federal Start-Up Visa (SUV) Program has been a wildly popular way for Iranian entrepreneurs to obtain permanent resident status in Canada. Since 2015, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada has received a total of 3,203 permanent-resident applications from 70 countries via the SUV program. Of those applicants, 615 were Iranians.\n\nKhazali's son, Hamid Rezazadeh\n\nGlavin also mentioned the more recently revealed case of Hamid Rezazadeh, Iranian Vice President for Women and Family Affairs, Ensieh Khazali's son, who has been living and working in Canada for several years.\n\nKhazali has denied her son's immigration to Canada and claimed he is there only on a short visit for further \"knowledge-based\" research. This is one of the favorite terms of Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei who has nicknamed the current year as \"the year of knowledge-based production.\"\n\nBut social media activists have provided some evidence that Rezazadeh is running a company in Canada that sells a VPN application called Betternet to circumvent government censorship of the Internet inside Iran.

    "Canada's tipping culture is flawed and there's no clear fix in sight: experts": "1:53:00 FULL EPISODE: What's your tipping story?\n\nFrom oil changes to take-out food, the \"tip nudge\" has quickly become a \"well-established societal norm\" in Canada, according to food economist Mike von Massow.\n\nCard payment machines have made it simple for businesses to prompt a gratuity option, even in industries where tipping previously wasn't part of the cost or conversation. And data from Canadian trade associations show the average percentage tip for restaurant dining has gone up since the pandemic began.\n\nVon Massow, who's also a professor at the University of Guelph, says the expectation for Canadians to increase the amount of their gratuities is getting out of control, and has become a hot-button issue across the country.\n\n\"I went to my local craft brewery the other day, just to the bottle shop, to pick up a couple of cans of my favourites,\" von Massow said. \"When I was paying there, literally someone grabbed beer out of the fridge and gave it to me and I was prompted to tip in that circumstance.\"\n\nHe calls it a \"double whammy\" for consumers, with more businesses asking for tips while simultaneously raising their prices.\n\n\"You know, I've started to wonder if I give a particularly good lecture, should I put a jar at the front of the lecture hall at the end, and as they file out? Maybe they could drop a few bills in there for me, too. I mean, where does it stop?\"\n\nInternational alternative\n\nKate Malcolm moved to Port Perry, Ont., in 2017 from the U.K., where tipping isn't common.\n\nFive years later she says she still has a hard time coming to grips with Canada's tip culture.\n\n\"There is no way that in England you would give $10, $20, $30 to a hairdresser,\" she said. \"It's so expensive to get your hair done as it is, and then you have to tip them as well? It's such a foreign concept.\"\n\nMalcolm, who runs a podcast aimed at newcomers, included her reaction to Canada's unwritten rules for gratuities in a TikTok video outlining her \"culture shock.\"\n\nA screenshot of Kate Malcolm in a TikTok video that includes her reaction to Canada's unwritten rules for gratuities. (Kate Malcolm/TikTok)\n\nShe says when her parents first came to visit they were also unclear what the expectations were for tipping in Canada, leading to an awkward exchange at a restaurant.\n\n\"They kind of just threw coins on the table, like maybe $2 and change, and were like, 'that's all we do, right?' I was cringing for that. I'm like, that is probably more insulting than not doing it [tipping].\"\n\nMalcolm lived and worked as a server in Australia, as well, where tipping is also not the norm.\n\nShe said the wage was much higher than in Canada, and without the expectation to make tips, she felt less pressure to be \"super friendly\" all the time.\n\nSome customers outraged by tip prompt\n\nThe Dough Bakeshop in Toronto added a gratuity option to its card machines after input from employees and customers.\n\nCo-owner Oonagh Butterfield says they've always had a cash tip jar at the counter but saw a significant increase in tips when customers were given a debit or credit card option to do so.\n\n\"I've had signs up since we implemented it, being as clear as I can be, saying it's not expected,\" she said.\n\nOonagh Butterfield, co-owner of Dough Bakeshop in Toronto, says some customers have shown outrage about being prompted for a tip even with signs posted in the store that say tips aren't expected. (Photo by Dylan Garez)\n\nDespite posting signage like \"to bypass the tip option please press green\" Butterfield says some customers still question the electronic gratuity option.\n\n\"Sometimes there's a little bit of, I'll say, outrage around the fact that they're even being asked the question, 'would you like to tip?' Especially if they're just buying bread, which, again, is why I try to communicate to people this is not a necessity.\"\n\nDespite currently having the tip option for customers, Butterfield says she supports moving away from Canada's current tipping culture, \"so that everyone can be guaranteed a living wage.\"\n\nNo tipping equals prices raised to give staff living wage\n\nIn July 2020, Toronto's Richmond Station restaurant did away with tipping, instead choosing to raise its prices to pay staff more.\n\nCo-owner Carl Heinrich calls Canada's tipping culture \"a very inequitable way of paying staff.\"\n\nThe lockdown forced his business to start offering take-out — historically a service that didn't generate a lot of tips, he says.\n\n\"Any time you edit somebody's wage or pay, their livelihood, there's a lot of communication necessary,\" Heinrich said. \"Because there was no blueprint for this new system, there was a lot of work. And frankly, two years later, it's still work.\"\n\nCarl Heinrich is the co-owner of Richmond Station restaurant in Toronto. He says they did away with tipping in July 2020. Instead, they chose to raise their prices to pay staff more. (Photo by Sarah Brownlee)\n\nThere isn't one flat rate of living wage for staff at Richmond Station. Pay varies depending on a person's performance, experience and their position, he added.\n\n\"Dishwashers are making a living wage. Servers are making a living wage. But certainly our best servers are paid more than our least experienced servers. In the previous system that wasn't possible.\"\n\nIn an ideal world, there would be no tipping. It's a human rights catastrophe. But it's just so deeply entrenched. I think we're stuck with it. - Marc Mentzer, business professor, University of Saskatchewan\n\nAside from \"very top end\" restaurants, where customers might not be as sensitive about how much they're spending, says University of Saskatchewan business professor Marc Mentzer, many businesses that replace tipping with service charges don't succeed.\n\nCustomers like the illusion of having power over the server and the server likes the illusion of controlling the amount of their own income, he adds.\n\n\"In an ideal world, there would be no tipping. It's a human rights catastrophe. But it's just so deeply entrenched. I think we're stuck with it.\"\n\nMarc Mentzer is a professor at the University of Saskatchewan’s Edwards School of Business. He says the card reader for electronic payment has changed expectations around how much to tip, when to tip, and what for. (Submitted by Marc Mentzer)\n\nHefty pre-programmed tip percentage options on chip card machines can \"scare people into tipping a higher percentage than they might have ever considered before,\" Mentzer added.\n\n\"Everybody complains about tipping, but given a choice between a restaurant with tipping and a restaurant with a service charge, I'm not sure how customers would make that choice. I think customers might actually prefer the tipping approach if given the choice.\"",

    "FIBA Women’s World Cup Takeaways: Canada defeats Japan, punches ticket to quarterfinals": "Bridget Carleton netted a game-high 19 points and pulled down six rebounds as Canada punched its ticket to the quarterfinals of the FIBA Women’s Basketball World Cup 2022 with a 70-56 victory over Japan.\n\nThe win improved Canada to 3-0 during the round robin phase of the tournament as it now leads Group B outright with six points.\n\nCanada’s win over Japan was revenge of sorts for a defeat during World Cup qualifiers in Osaka, Japan earlier this year, when the Canadians blew a 20-point lead only to lose in overtime.\n\n“That was a big game for us,” Carleton said after the game. “We played Japan in February, we were up by a lot and they ended up forcing it to overtime and we ended up losing. So, that was kind of in the back of our minds today.”\n\nCarleton went 8-for-14 from the field, including shooting 2-for-5 from deep, breaking out of a slump that saw her score just 12 points on 4-of-20 shooting in Canada’s first two games combined.\n\n“[It was] definitely good to come away with the win,” she said. “And it felt good to see some shots go in for me.”\n\nMaki Takada led Japan with 11 points as the usually free-wheeling, three-point bombing Japanese side was stymied by yet another strong Canadian effort on the defensive end. Canada held Japan to 32 per cent shooting from the floor and a dismal 17 per cent clip from outside.\n\nUp next for the Canadians will be an encounter with host Australia Monday at 6:30 a.m. ET, a pivotal matchup that could very well end up determining who wins the group. The world No. 3 ranked Australians were initially expected to win the group coming into the tournament, but their opening-game loss to France opened the door for another team like Canada possibly take top spot.\n\nHere’s a few more takeaways from another Canadian win at the World Cup.\n\nCanada punches ticket to quarterfinals in impressive fashion\n\nCanada has made it into the knockout round in the fewest possible games, a praiseworthy feat, for sure, but even more impressive is the road it took doing it.\n\nThough certainly not a slouch as the No. 4 ranked program in the world, Canada has still had a killer path so far beating the likes of No. 10 Serbia, No. 6 France and, now, No. 8 Japan, a team that also happened to capture the silver medal at the most recent Olympic Games.\n\nThose are three quality wins back-to-back-to-back and have shown Canada to be a force to be reckoned with early on through the tournament and has given Canada growing confidence in itself.\n\n“It’s great to be 3-0,” Carleton said. “I wouldn’t say it exceeds our expectations. Every game we go into we think we can win. We think we should win. Our goal is always to be on the podium, so this is exactly where we want to be, 3-0.”\n\nAn added bonus Canada’s got for itself by reaching the quarters so quickly is this guarantees that it won’t see the No. 1 ranked United States in its opening elimination-round game. Like, Canada, the U.S. locked up a quarterfinal berth and sits atop of Group A with a perfect 3-0 record.\n\nHounding defence in second quarter breaks game open\n\nThe Canadian defence was outstanding yet again, but unlike the shutdown job in the halfcourt that was seen against Serbia and France, in its game with Japan, Canada’s defence showed a different defensive look in order to slow down the Japanese quick-strike attack.\n\nCanada went on 13-0 run to end the second quarter, breaking the game open and allowing it to cruise to victory in the second half. This was sparked mainly by the substitution head coach Victor Lapena made midway through the frame to bring in sparsely-used guard Sami Hill, whom he had pick up full court in an effort to disrupt Japan’s offensive flow.\n\nIt ended up working as Hill’s quick feet and relentless on-ball pressure rattled the Japanese ballhandlers, allowing Canada to create some turnovers and get easy baskets that helped turn the game in Canada’s favour.\n\n“I don’t know if it was the key of the game, but it was important,” Lapena said. “Sami has a very special energy … when we need energy on the court, we need Sami. And so, that was my decision.”\n\nCanadian offence breaks out\n\nCanada’s contest against Japan proved to be its best offensive performance of the tournament so far.\n\nThe defence has been the main spotlight, but the Canadians were sharp offensively in the game as well.\n\nOf course, Carleton’s breakout performance certainly helped, but the 70 points Canada put up was the most it’s done so far and the 30-of-69 shooting performance from the field proved to be both the team’s most made field goals and field-goal attempts so far.\n\nMore importantly, was the apparent offensive process with players hunting for better matchups and looking to get the entire team involved more often than not. This was most apparent in the play of 21-year-old forward Laeticia Amihere, a rising star of the program who’s contributions to the senior team have mostly lied in her ability score and rebound, she seemed to unlock another aspect of her game against Japan, dropping five dimes to go along with the 10 points and six rebounds she also tallied.\n\nThose five assists Amihere racked up was a game high and revealed a high-low game among Canada’s bigs that wasn’t apparent before, another area of attack that the Canadians might be able to go to as the tournament progresses.",
