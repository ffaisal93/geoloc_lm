    "Cuba overwhelmingly approves same-sex marriage in referendum": "New code also would allow surrogate pregnancies, broader rights for grandparents and measures against gender violence.\n\nCubans have overwhelmingly approved a sweeping ‚Äúfamily law‚Äù that would allow same-sex couples to marry and adopt, the electoral commission said, in a move that will also redefine rights for children and grandparents.\n\nMore than 3.9 million voters ‚Äì 66.9 percent ‚Äì voted to ratify the new code while 1.95 million or 33 percent were opposed, National Electoral Council President Alina Balseiro Gutierrez said on state-run television on Monday.\n\nThe 100-page ‚Äúfamily code‚Äù legalises same-sex marriage and civil unions, allows same-sex couples to adopt children, and promotes equal sharing of domestic rights and responsibilities between men and women.\n\nPreliminary results from the electoral commission showed 74 percent of 8.4 million Cubans eligible to vote participated in the Sunday referendum.\n\n‚ÄúLove is now the law,‚Äù President Miguel Diaz-Canel wrote on Twitter on Monday morning.\n\n‚ÄúIt is paying off a debt with several generations of Cuban men and women, whose family projects have been waiting for this law for years,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAs of today, we will be a better nation.‚Äù\n\nGan√≥ el S√≠. Se ha hecho justicia. Aprobar el #C√≥digoDeLasFamilias es hacer justicia. Es saldar una deuda con varias generaciones de cubanas y cubanos, cuyos proyectos de familia llevan a√±os esperando por esta Ley. A partir de hoy seremos una naci√≥n mejor. #ElAmorYaEsLey ‚ù§Ô∏èüá®üá∫ pic.twitter.com/O5o0Hi2cm1 ‚Äî Miguel D√≠az-Canel Berm√∫dez (@DiazCanelB) September 26, 2022\n\nTranslation: Yes has won. Justice has been done. To approve the Family code is to do justice. It is paying off a debt with several generations of Cuban men and women, whose family projects have been waiting for this law for years. As of today, we will be a better nation.\n\nThe reforms had met unusually strong open resistance from a growing evangelical movement in Cuba ‚Äî and many other Cubans ‚Äî despite an extensive government campaign in favour of the measure.\n\nThat push included thousands of informative meetings across the country and extensive media coverage backing it.\n\nCuban elections, in which no party other than the Communist is allowed, routinely produce victory margins of more than 90 percent ‚Äî as did a referendum on a major constitutional reform in 2019.\n\nThe ‚Äúfamily law‚Äù measure had been approved by Cuba‚Äôs parliament, the National Assembly, after years of debate about such reforms.\n\nIt would allow surrogate pregnancies, broader rights for grandparents in regard to grandchildren, protection of the elderly and measures against gender violence.\n\nDiaz-Canel, who has promoted the law, acknowledged questions about the measure as he voted on Sunday. ‚ÄúMost of our people will vote in favour of the code, but it still has issues that our society as a whole does not understand,‚Äù he said.\n\nA major supporter of the measure was Mariela Castro, director of the National Center for Sex Education and a promoter of rights for same-sex couples. She is the daughter of former President Raul Castro and the niece of his brother, Cuban leader Fidel Castro.\n\nBut there is a strong strain of social conservatism in Cuba and several religious leaders have expressed concern or opposition to the law, worrying it could weaken nuclear families.\n\nWhile Cuba was officially atheist for decades after the 1959 revolution led by Fidel Castro, it has become more tolerant of religions over the past quarter century.\n\nThat has meant a greater opening not only to the once-dominant Roman Catholic Church, but also to Afro-Cuban religions, protestants and Muslims.\n\nSome of those churches took advantage of the opening in 2018 and 2019 to campaign against another plebiscite that would have rewritten the constitution in a way to allow gay marriage.\n\nOpposition was strong enough that the government at that time backed away.",
    "Hurricane Ian nears Cuba on path to strike Florida as Cat 4": "HAVANA (AP) ‚Äî Hurricane Ian was growing stronger as it approached the western tip of Cuba on a track to hit the west coast of Florida as a major hurricane as early as Wednesday.\n\nIan was forecast to hit the western tip of Cuba as a major hurricane and then become an even stronger Category 4 with top winds of 140 mph (225 km/h) over warm Gulf of Mexico waters before striking Florida.\n\nAs of Monday, Tampa and St. Petersburg appeared to be the among the most likely targets for their first direct hit by a major hurricane since 1921.\n\n‚ÄúPlease treat this storm seriously. It‚Äôs the real deal. This is not a drill,‚Äù Hillsborough County Emergency Management Director Timothy Dudley said at a news conference on storm preparations in Tampa.\n\nAuthorities in Cuba evacuated 50,000 people in Pinar del Rio province, sent in medical and emergency personnel, and took steps to protect food and other crops in warehouses, according to state media.\n\n‚ÄúCuba is expecting extreme hurricane-force winds, also life threatening storm surge and heavy rainfall,‚Äù U.S. National Hurricane Center senior specialist Daniel Brown told The Associated Press early Monday.\n\nHere are the 11am EDT Monday 26 September Key Messages for Hurricane #Ian.\n\n\n\nLatest Advisory: https://t.co/tnOTyfOjMY pic.twitter.com/3yeYqkQCxe ‚Äî National Hurricane Center (@NHC_Atlantic) September 26, 2022\n\nThe hurricane center predicted areas of Cuba‚Äôs western coast could see as much as 14 feet (4.3 meters) of storm surge Monday night or early Tuesday.\n\nIn Havana, fishermen were taking their boats out of the water along the famous Malecon, the seaside boardwalk, and city workers were busy unclogging storm drains ahead of the expected rain.\n\nHavana resident Adyz Ladron, 35, said the potential for rising water from the storm worries him.\n\n‚ÄúI am very scared because my house gets completely flooded, with water up to here,‚Äù he said, pointing to his chest.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Ian was moving northwest at 13 mph (20 km/h), about 195 miles (310 kilometers) southeast of the western tip of Cuba, with top sustained winds increasing to 85 mph (135 km/h).\n\nThe center of the hurricane was passing to the west of the Cayman Islands, where Premier Wayne Panton said the government and its opposition were working together to keep the people as safe as possible. No major damage was reported there Monday, and residents were going back into the streets as the winds died down.\n\nIan won‚Äôt linger over Cuba, but will slow down over the Gulf of Mexico, growing wider and stronger, ‚Äúwhich will have the potential to produce significant wind and storm surge impacts along the west coast of Florida,‚Äù the hurricane center said.\n\nA surge of up to 10 feet (3 meters) of ocean water and 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain was predicted across the Tampa Bay area, with as much as 15 inches (38 centimeters) inches in isolated areas. That‚Äôs enough water to inundate coastal communities.\n\nMichael Brennan, the acting deputy director of NOAA, discusses the forecast track of Hurricane Ian. (Source: CNN)\n\nAs many as 300,000 people may be evacuated from low-lying areas in Hillsborough County alone, county administrator Bonnie Wise said. Some of those evacuations were beginning Monday afternoon in the most vulnerable areas, with schools and other locations opening as shelters.\n\n‚ÄúWe must do everything we can to protect our residents. Time is of the essence,‚Äù Wise said.\n\nFloridians lined up for hours in Tampa to collect bags of sand and cleared store shelves of bottled water. Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a statewide emergency and warned that Ian could lash large areas of the state, knocking out power and interrupting fuel supplies as it swirls northward off the state‚Äôs Gulf coast.\n\n‚ÄúYou have a significant storm that may end up being a Category 4 hurricane,‚Äù DeSantis said at a news conference. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs going to cause a huge amount of storm surge. You‚Äôre going to have flood events. You‚Äôre going to have a lot of different impacts.‚Äù\n\nDeSantis said the state has suspended tolls around the Tampa Bay area and mobilized 5,000 Florida state national guard troops, with another 2,000 on standby in neighboring states.\n\nPresident Joe Biden also declared an emergency, authorizing the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate disaster relief and provide assistance to protect lives and property. The president postponed a scheduled Tuesday trip to Florida because of the storm.\n\nPlaying it safe, NASA planned to begin slowly rolling its moon rocket from the launch pad to its Kennedy Space Center hangar, adding weeks of delay to the test flight.\n\nFlash flooding was predicted for much of the Florida peninsula, and heavy rainfall was possible for the southeast United States later this week. With tropical storm force winds extending 115 miles (185 kilometers) from Ian‚Äôs center, watches covered the Florida Keys to Lake Okeechobee.\n\nBob Gualtieri, sheriff of Pinellas County, Florida, which includes St. Petersburg, said in a briefing that although no one will be forced to leave, mandatory evacuation orders are expected to begin Tuesday.\n\n‚ÄúWhat it means is, we‚Äôre not going to come help you. If you don‚Äôt do it, you‚Äôre on your own,‚Äù Gualtieri said.\n\nZones to be evacuated include all along Tampa Bay and the rivers that feed it. St. Petersburg Mayor Ken Welch urged residents not to ignore any evacuation orders.\n\n‚ÄúThis is a very real threat that this storm poses to our community,‚Äù Welch said.\n\nThe hurricane center has advised Floridians to have survival plans in place and monitor updates of the storm‚Äôs evolving path.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press contributors include Curt Anderson in St. Petersburg, Florida; Anthony Izaguirre in Tallahassee, Florida; and Julie Walker in New York.\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

    "Pandemic worsened inequalities, exposed true essence of unjust global order, Cuba tells UN": "‚ÄúNever has humankind had this wealth of scientific and technical potential that it has now, neither has it ever had the extraordinary capacity than it does now to create wealth and well-being,‚Äù he said on Wednesday, but added: ‚ÄúHowever, never has the world been so unequal in terms of just how much people suffer.‚Äù\n\nHe pointed to some grim figures, including that some 828 million people are going hungry, around 50 million children suffer from stunting and unemployment will affect 207 million persons in 2022.\n\nTrillions in military spending while vaccines remain scarce\n\nHe went on to note that around 6.5 million people have died because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and vaccinations to tackle this crisis are inaccessible to billions of people in low-income countries.\n\nReferring to global military expenditures, which have grown at a dizzying pace and for the first time now exceeds $2 trillion dollars, and while championing the universalization of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, he raised the question of how much more could be done if these resources were devoted to promoting health and development, how many lives could be saved.\n\nTalking about the climate crisis, the Cuban Foreign Minister remarked, ‚Äúwe have one planet earth, one common home, for the rich and the poor, we must act without delay.‚Äù\n\nEconomic war against Cuba\n\nIn sharing his observation that international relations are moving along a dangerous path, he decried the United States for its offensive of economic, military, political and diplomatic coercion.\n\nRecalling the General Assembly‚Äôs adoption of the first resolution to end the embargo against Cuba 30 years ago, he denounced the US for the ‚Äúact of economic war in times of peace,‚Äù for ignoring the resolution, creating material shortages, pressuring banking institutions and damaging the Cuban people.\n\nCriticizing the ‚Äúunfair inclusion‚Äù and ‚Äúslanderous classification‚Äù of Cuba as a sponsor of terrorism when Cuba ‚Äúhas been a victim of state terrorism‚Äù, he called out the US for its double standards, inconsistency, selectivity and manipulation including on human rights.\n\nReferring to the colossal challenges that face the Cuban people and government, he said ‚Äúthe Cuban economy has withstood extraordinary pressure which is having an impact on industry service provision, leading to scarcity in food and medicine, and leading to a decline in consumption and thus resulting in a decline in the general well-being of our people. The human damage caused by this policy is impossible to quantify but is nevertheless vast, cruel and immoral.‚Äù\n\nUrging the US to address the issues fueling irregular migration, he commended the return of visa processing at the US embassy in Havana and reiterated Cuba‚Äôs readiness to move towards better relations with the US but only based on mutual respect, sovereign equality and no attempts at undermining sovereignty and independence.\n\nSolidarity with others\n\nThe Foreign Minister shared that at the worst moments of the pandemic, Cuba was able to send 58 medical brigades to some 48 countries. He went on to express solidarity with the governments of Venezuela and Nicaragua, support for Caribbean nations‚Äô claims for reparations for the slave trade and colonialism, reaffirmed Cuba‚Äôs commitment to independence of Puerto Rico and reconstruction of Haiti.\n\nMr. Bruno Rodr√≠guez reiterated Cuba‚Äôs staunch commitment to peace in Colombia, an end to foreign interference in Syria, and a just and lasting solution to the Middle East conflict. He also called for an end of the Israel occupation of the Palestinian territories.\n\nHe concluded by turning to Ukraine and said that the realistic solution to the war must guarantee the security and sovereignty of all. He said, ‚ÄúCuba will continue to speak out loud and clear to reject hegemonism and domination, unilateral coercive measure, genocide blockades and attempts to impose one culture and one model on the world.‚Äù",

    "Cuba approves same-sex marriage in unusual referendum": "HAVANA (AP) ‚Äî Cubans have approved a sweeping \"family law‚Äù code that would allow same-sex couples to marry and adopt as well as redefining rights for children and grandparents, officials said Monday, though opposition in the national referendum was unusually strong on the Communist Party-governed island.\n\nThe measure ‚Äî which contains more than 400 articles ‚Äî was approved by 66.9% to 33.1%, the president of the National Electoral Council, Alina Balseiro Guti√©rrez, told official news media, though returns from a few places remained to be counted.\n\nThe reforms had met unusually strong open resistance from the growing evangelical movement in Cuba ‚Äî and many other Cubans ‚Äî despite an extensive government campaign in favor of the measure, including thousands of informative meetings across the country and extensive media coverage backing it.\n\nCuban elections ‚Äî in which no party other than the Communist is allowed ‚Äî routinely produce victory margins of more than 90% ‚Äî as did a referendum on a major constitutional reform in 2019.\n\nThe code would allow surrogate pregnancies, broader rights for grandparents in regard to grandchildren, protection of the elderly and measures against gender violence.\n\nPresident Miguel D√≠az-Canel, who has promoted the law acknowledged questions about the measure as he voted on Sunday.\n\n‚ÄúMost of our people will vote in favor of the code, but it still has issues that our society as a whole does not understand,\" he said.\n\nOn Monday, he celebrated approval of the measure, tweeting ‚ÄúLove is now the law.‚Äù\n\nPassage ‚Äúis to pay a debt to various generation of Cubans whose domestic plans had been waiting years for this law,\" he added. ‚ÄúAs of today, we will be a better nation.‚Äù\n\nThe measure had been approved by Cuba's Parliament, the National Assembly, after years of debate about such reforms.\n\nA major supporter of the measure was Mariela Castro, director of the National Center for Sex Education, a promoter of rights for same-sex couples, daughter of former President Raul Castro and niece of his brother Fidel.\n\nBut there is a strong strain of social conservatism in Cuba and several religious leaders have expressed concern or opposition to the law., worrying it could weaken nuclear families.\n\nWhile Cuba was officially ‚Äî and often militantly ‚Äî atheist for decades after the 1959 revolution led by Fidel Castro ‚Äî Raul‚Äôs brother ‚Äî it has become more tolerant of religions over the past quarter century. That has meant a greater opening not only the once-dominant Roman Catholic Church, but also to Afro-Cuban religions, protestants and Muslims.\n\nSome of those churches took advantage of the opening in 2018 and 2019 to campaign against another plebiscite which would have rewritten the constitution in a way to allow gay marriage.\n\nOpposition was strong enough that the government at that time backed away.\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

    "Mark Cuban Considering Leaving Shark Tank As He Bets His Legacy On Low-Cost Drugs": "Blockchain, basketball, Broadcast.com: Mark Cuban has never lost his passion for disruption. Now the billionaire entrepreneur has an ambitious plan to take on Big Pharma and lower the cost of prescription drugs once and for all. And, after 13 seasons, this savvy shark may finally be ready to leave the tank.\n\nM ark Cuban unlocks his phone and opens his inbox, which is pinging like crazy as email after email fills the screen. ‚ÄúBam, bam, bam, bam, bam,‚Äù he says, swiping each into the garbage with barely a moment‚Äôs thought.\n\nOne with the subject line ‚ÄúA Desperate Plea‚Äù: delete. Next, an email about a crypto project he‚Äôs working on‚ÄîCuban agreed to buy the digital rights to drawings by one of the World Trade Center architects and is planning to turn them into NFTs. He squints. The type‚Äôs too small. Next. Finally, an email from an aspiring entrepreneur. His first act of mercy: ‚ÄúI like these guys. I‚Äôll save them for later.‚Äù\n\nCuban in real life is not that much different from the role he‚Äôs played for 11 years‚Äîor in TV math, 13 seasons‚Äîon Shark Tank. He listens to everyone, at least briefly, before making snap judgments. His personal email address is public (mcuban@gmail.com), and the billionaire investor slogs through every scam, spam message or pitch sent his way. Why? He can‚Äôt help it. ‚ÄúTo me it‚Äôs the sport I get to compete in and I get to be really good at,‚Äù he says, grinning. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be 110 years old still doing whatever is the equivalent 50 years from now of responding to email.‚Äù\n\nCuban, the entrepreneur, has founded more than ten companies, starting in 1983 with software reseller MicroSolutions and up to Cost Plus Drugs, the public benefit corporation he star¬≠ted in January 2022, which aims to lower prescription drug prices. Cuban, the insta-billionaire, sold Broadcast.com, an internet sports radio outfit, to Yahoo for $5.7 billion at the peak of the dot-com bubble in 1999 (a few years la¬≠ter, Yahoo shuttered the service). Cuban, the investor, has poured at least $25 million into crypto concerns (including dogecoin, the currency famously started as a joke) and taken stakes in at least 400 startups, many through Shark Tank.\n\nSome of his gambles have done all right; some have blown up. But more than two decades later, Broadcast.com is still the main reason he got so rich, worth an estima¬≠ted $4.6 billion. (Cuban didn‚Äôt start Broadcast.com; it was founded in 1992 by Chris Jaeb. He joined three years later with his college buddy Todd Wagner, also a Broadcast.com billionaire.) The Yahoo sale earned Cuban an estimated $1.1 billion payout after taxes. He spent $280 million of that buying a majority stake in the NBA‚Äôs Dallas Mavericks the next year. Bam, another slam dunk. Now worth $2.2 billion, according to Forbes‚Äô estimate, his 85% stake in the team represents almost half his fortune.\n\nPhoto by Guerin Blask for Forbes\n\n‚ÄúOn the one hand I understand that nobody should have this much wealth, but it is what it is,‚Äù Cuban says. ‚ÄúYou make the best of it, and I don‚Äôt feel guilty about it at all. I busted my ass to get here.‚Äù\n\nCuban is the rare billionaire who seems to actually enjoy being rich. In his younger years he embraced his wealth by buying a sprawling Dallas mansion, an apartment on Central Park West and a private jet, and traveling the world partying ‚Äúlike a rock star.‚Äù More recently he‚Äôs been having a blast doling out advice on Shark Tank and via Twitter (he has 8.8 million followers), buying shots for strangers and running his mouth to anyone who will listen. He still spends money on fun stuff. Case in point: He recently bought the town of Mustang, Texas (population: zero), as a favor to a dying friend (‚Äúthis was his big asset‚Äù), and appointed one of his other pals the mayor. The billionaire toyed with the idea of filling the ghost town with life-size robotic dinosaurs made by one of his Shark Tank entrepreneurs but has since deemed that impractical. He‚Äôs open to other ideas. (Email him.)\n\nOn the far side of the seriousness spectrum from animatronic T-Rexes is his new pharmaceutical business, Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drugs, which he‚Äôs positioning as the remedy to skyrocketing prescription prices. Launched nine months ago, Cost Plus Drugs offers steep discounts on around 350 different generic medications. Generic Crestor, a cholesterol-lowering med, costs $151 a month at the local CVS, a steep discount from the brand-name pill, which runs $329. Cuban sells it for $4.80. Ditto Glucophage, a diabetes drug. The generic sells for $20 at CVS, versus $3.90 at Cost Plus. Or there‚Äôs the generic version of antidepressant Zoloft, which is $50 at CVS but $4.20 at Cost Plus.\n\n‚ÄúNobody should have this much wealth, but it is what it is. You make the best of it, and I don‚Äôt feel guilty about it at all.‚Äù\n\nCuban can offer such low prices because he bypasses the pharma industry‚Äôs many middlemen, including the price negotiators known as pharmacy benefit managers. (It is a huge, notoriously opaque business. Market leader CVS Caremark generated $153 billion in sales in 2021.) Instead, Cuban buys directly from the folks who manufacture the pills, paying them just enough to make it worth their while, then sells them online at a fixed markup of 15%, plus $8 for shipping and fees. It‚Äôs not an entirely novel idea. Walmart and Costco are experimenting with similar models. But Cuban, perhaps thanks to his celeb¬≠rity, is quickly gaining traction. Cost Plus Drugs already claims more than a million customers and says it is growing at a rate of about 10% each week, on track to be profitable in 2023. Cuban is uncharacteristically tight-lipped about revenue; Forbes estimates Cost Plus has booked at least $25 million in sales during its first nine months as an operating concern.\n\nCuban, who notes that it‚Äôs the first com¬≠pany he‚Äôs ever put his name on, has invested close to $100 million so far and says he‚Äôs all in on the idea and willing to spend ‚Äúwhatever it takes.‚Äù It is, in his own words, ‚Äúlegacy defining. If we get this right, this will be the most impactful thing I‚Äôve ever done.‚Äù\n\nHe insists he will pull back from other projects to focus on Cost Plus Drugs. He is even considering stepping away from Shark Tank. ‚ÄúPart of me wants to quit,‚Äù he says. He‚Äôs not worried about whether the show will sink or swim. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll survive fine without me.‚Äù\n\nKILLER INSTINCTS | (From left) Longtime Shark Tank stars Mark Cuban, Barbara Corcoran, Kevin O‚ÄôLeary and Lori Greiner with guest investor Daniel Lubetzky, the founder of Kind bars, during the show‚Äôs 13th season. ABC\n\nC uban‚Äôs friends and family all say the same thing: He was a born entrepreneur. Raised in the quiet Pittsburgh suburb of Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania, as the eldest of three sons of working-class parents, he stood out from a young age for his endless stream of moneymaking schemes.\n\n‚ÄúHe was always doing stuff, always hustling to make a buck,‚Äù says younger brother Jeff, who runs Cuban‚Äôs entertainment properties, including movie distributor Magnolia Pictures. Once, during a printer strike in Pennsylvania, a teenaged Cuban got up before dawn and drove 130 miles to Cleveland to buy newspapers to sell in his hometown.\n\n‚ÄúLuck is a huge part of everyone‚Äôs success. Shaq used to give me a hard time: ‚ÄòOh, you got lucky.‚Äô And I‚Äôm like, ‚Äòyou planned to be seven-foot-two and athletic, right?‚Äô‚Äù\n\nThe ploys got more ambitious as he got older. As a rising senior at the University of Indiana, he begged and borrowed enough‚Äîeven dipping into his student loans‚Äîto purchase a local bar, Motley‚Äôs Pub. It was at Motley‚Äôs, which was eventually forced to close because of underage drinking, that he met his future Broadcast.com partner Todd Wagner. In August, Cuban returned to the site of Motley‚Äôs, now called Kilroy‚Äôs on Kirkwood, and left a $10,000 tip after buying 100 shots for its patrons.\n\n‚Äú[He] always knew he was either going to make it big or he was just going to go broke,‚Äù says Jerry Katz, who has known Cuban since kindergarten.\n\nBy 32, Cuban was a multimillionaire after selling Micro¬≠Solutions to CompuServe, an early online service, for $6 million. He decided to retire. But that didn‚Äôt stick for long. In 1995, the year Netscape went public, he and Wagner bought into Broadcast.com, then called AudioNet, which was struggling to find a way to provide the play-by-play of out-of-town sports, even experimenting with shortwave radio. Cuban and Wagner took the idea online. As Web 1.0 mania inflated, Broadcast.com recorded the best-ever IPO at the time, ending its first trading day with a market cap of $1 billion, more than 300 times its sales of $3.2 million. It sold to Yahoo a year later.\n\nCuban knew a bubble when he saw one. He and Wagner were paid in Yahoo shares, but in a savvy move suggested by Cuban, the duo used stock collars to cap their upside if the stock jumped‚Äîbut limited their downside if the shares plummeted. Still, he readily admits that his lucky break was exactly that. ‚ÄúLuck is a huge part of everyone‚Äôs success. Shaq used to give me a hard time when I first got to the NBA. He goes, ‚ÄòOh, you got lucky.‚Äô And I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄòYou planned to be seven-foot-two and athletic, right?‚Äô‚Äù\n\nWagner, who has partnered with Cuban on multiple businesses since, including the Mavericks, and who himself is worth some $1.8 billion, argues it‚Äôs much more than just luck. ‚ÄúMark, I think, has always had an ability, and still does, to see around corners,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI think of Mark as the smartest, best-prepared guy in the room.‚Äù\n\nA s much as he loves money, Cuban might love being famous even more. In 2004, he starred in The Benefactor, ABC‚Äôs answer to Donald Trump‚Äôs Apprentice, in which 16 contestants competed for $1 million out of Cuban‚Äôs fortune. It was canceled after one season. (Trump later wrote to Cuban consoling him on his ‚Äúdisastrous‚Äù and ‚Äúembarrassing‚Äù effort. ‚ÄúIf you ever decide to do another show, please call me and I will be happy to lend a helping hand.‚Äù) A big silver lining: meeting producer Clay Newbill, who later recruited him for Shark Tank. Cuban wasn‚Äôt available for the show‚Äôs pilot in 2009 but joined as a ‚Äúguest shark‚Äù in the second season in 2011. He has been on every episode since.\n\n‚ÄúEverybody, at some level, wants to be a celebrity,‚Äù says Cuban, who has also appeared in dozens of TV shows and movies as himself, including Entourage and Brooklyn Nine-Nine.\n\nLike other Hollywood types, Cuban has become enamored with NFTs, down to owning a CryptoPunk (No. 869, currently valued at $95,000.) He was a prominent supporter of NBA Top Shot, the league‚Äôs highly successful NFT marketplace (more than $1 billion in total sales since its October 2020 launch), and even star¬≠ted his own NFT platform, Lazy.com, where he displays his personal collection. In March 2021, the Mavericks became the first NBA team to accept the meme cryptocurrency dogecoin as a form of payment‚Äîand (incredibly) still do despite the currency plummeting 90% since last year. It‚Äôs quite an about-face for Cuban, who quipped back in 2019 that he‚Äôd ‚Äúrather have bananas‚Äù than bitcoin.\n\nLast October, the Mavericks inked a five-year partnership with Voyager Digital, one of the fastest-growing publicly traded crypto brokerages in the United States. Voya¬≠ger has since lost 99% of its value and filed for bankruptcy, prompting a group of customers to sue Cuban, arguing that his endorsement duped everyday investors into pumping $5 billion (now frozen) into the platform. Cuban won‚Äôt comment on the lawsuit beyond saying it won‚Äôt stop him from promoting crypto.\n\nThe launch of Cost Plus Drugs in January was years in the making for Cuban‚Äîand even longer for his cofounder, Alex Oshmyansky, a radiologist from Colorado who, with some doctor friends, came up with the idea of selling off-patent drugs at manufacturing cost back in 2015. The doctors imagined it as a nonprofit and spent three years searching for funding. ‚ÄúWe failed spectacularly and didn‚Äôt raise a single dime beyond what I put in myself,‚Äù says Oshmyansky, who invested about $200,000. In 2018, he switched gears and reincorporated as a public benefit corporation, meaning he could run the pharmacy as a business rather than a charity. That‚Äôs when Cuban got involved.\n\nThe billionaire‚Äôs initial investment was small (about $250,000), but he incrementally put in more money as the company made progress in overcoming regulatory hurdles and persuading hesitant drug manufacturers to participate. It took a full year to convince the first manufacturer, New Jersey‚Äìbased Amneal Pharmaceuticals, to agree to make drugs for Cost Plus. At first, Cost Plus offered just 100 medi¬≠cations from three manufacturers. Now it works with 20 manufacturing partners and is adding about 100 new drugs every month.\n\nCost Plus is also planning to manufacture its own medi¬≠cations. Its $11 million, 22,000-square-foot Dallas manu¬≠facturing facility is set to open in November. The all-robotic plant has been designed as a ‚Äúflexible‚Äù facility that can quickly pivot to make whatever drugs the company can‚Äôt source from other manufacturers.\n\nA Shark‚Äôs Mark\n\nIn his 13 seasons as a Shark Tank judge, Mark Cuban says he‚Äôs invested $29 million in at least 85 companies. He has hit a handful of home runs, but just like a traditional VC, he‚Äôs also struck out a bunch (at least two Cuban-backed startups have declared bankruptcy or stopped operating). One big winner: preschool app Brightwheel, of which Cuban owns a 2% stake worth $12 million, 20 times his estimated investment. Here are a couple more from each side of the scorecard.\n\nWinners\n\n\n\n\n\ntk tk\n\nDude Products\n\nFour young guys in Chicago who prefer baby wipes to toilet paper invented flushable Dude Wipes, packaged in single travel packets for on-the-go use.

In September, the company raised $15 million from private investors at a $200 million valuation.\n\nLosers\n\n\n\n\n\nBreathometer\n\nCuban put an estimated $250,000 into this smartphone attachment to measure blood alcohol levels in 2013 but later called it his worst investment.

It floundered, filing for bankruptcy in 2012‚Äîjust one year after Cuban and fellow shark Kevin O‚ÄôLeary pledged to invest $200,000 on the show.\n\n\n\n\n\n‚ÄîConor Murray and Jemima McEvoy\n\nFor all its benefits, Cost Plus has some major limitations. The company doesn‚Äôt accept insurance. Nor does it currently sell drugs that are still protected by patents, which include blockbusters like Humira (arthritis) and Trulicity (diabetes). ‚ÄúOur goal is to be the low-cost provider of medications, and we will surprise a lot of people when we have branded drugs,‚Äù Cuban says. ‚ÄúI think people are just missing us. . . . They kind of pigeonhole us.‚Äù\n\nBeyond pharma, Cuban is thinking about higher ed, another industry ripe for disruption. ‚ÄúThe one thing I will never do is give a school money, because all they‚Äôre going to do is build buildings,‚Äù he says. He argues that a better approach would be universities stripped down to the basics. Skip the ‚Äúpretty dorms,‚Äù fancy cafeterias, rock-climbing walls and Division I sports and focus instead on recruiting the best teachers and keeping tuition low.\n\nBy nature, Cuban is not a pessimist, but the ‚Äúone thing‚Äù that gets him down is American poli¬≠tics. He isn‚Äôt a fan of efforts to hike billionaires‚Äô taxes (shocker!) and thinks the electoral process needs an overhaul. ‚ÄúI want to blow up the two-party system,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúTo me, that is the root of all evil.‚Äù He seriously explored a presidential run in 2020 but decided against it after attracting less than 25% of the vote in a national poll he commissioned.\n\nFour years ago, Cuban turned 60. His birthday celebration was exactly the sort of blowout you might imagine. A host of friends and celebrities‚Äîhis Shark Tank colleagues, singer Jennifer Lopez and her then-fianc√©, former New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez‚Äîgathered on the lawn of his epic 24,000-square-foot Dallas spread. Stevie Wonder and the Chainsmokers, a popular electronic-music duo, provided the entertainment.\n\nToward the end of the night, Cuban wandered up to his childhood friends Jerry Katz and Todd Reidbord. ‚ÄúHe was the drunkest I‚Äôd ever seen anybody, but [he was] a happy person,‚Äù Reidbord recalls. ‚ÄúHe put his arms around us and said, ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt believe this happened to me.‚Äô‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE FROM FORBES\n\nMORE FROM FORBES Crypto Darling Helium Promised A 'People's Network.'

But experts urge everyone in the region to have an emergency plan in place, even if the latest track doesn't show the storm making landfall in their area.\n\nPredictions currently call for the storm to remain off of Florida's western coast as it moves north toward the Panhandle. But it will drop heavy rain along the way ‚Äî up to 15 inches in local areas, and 8-10 inches in central western Florida overall.\n\nIn areas along the coast, the deepest waters are expected to strike on the storm's right-hand side, due to the double-whammy of the storm surge and waves whipped by strong winds.\n\n\"Regardless of Ian's exact track and intensity, there is a risk of a life-threatening storm surge, hurricane-force winds, and heavy rainfall along the west coast of Florida and the Florida Panhandle by the middle of this week,\" the NHC said on Monday.\n\nGrocery shoppers in the storm's predicted path are stocking up on water, batteries and other supplies. Some shelves were reportedly bare in northern Florida, but in the Tampa area, residents were more relaxed, hoping the storm will steer clear of them.\n\n\"It's trending west,\" a shopper at a Winn-Dixie store in Sarasota told member station WUSF on Sunday. \"We have looked at the models and only a few of them look like they are going to impact us, everything else says it is going to be the Panhandle.\"\n\nCopyright 2022 NPR.

    "Cuba: the communist climate criminal kids ignore": "When it comes to socialist and communist dictatorships, environmental groups fall silent. There is an unwillingness to criticise these oil-heavy nations for profiting off the black gold of fossil fuel, even when things go horribly wrong.\n\nThis moral double standard makes a mockery of UN-affiliated green groups who routinely heap praise on their ideological bedfellows while demonising Western nations for their rolling green fields of family farms or the horror of reliable energy grids.\n\nThe ethical dilemma was on full display when a Cuban oil storage facility at the Matanzas supertanker port went up in flames on August 5 after it was struck by lightning. The resulting blaze spread across four fuel tanks over the following week, injuring over a hundred. It was later discovered that 16 firefighters were missing and eventually confirmed dead. The ferocity of the blaze sent thick, black smoke laden with chemicals churning into the sky like a volcanic eruption.\n\nThe Big one‚Ä¶ Raging fire in Cuban oil depot leaves 80 injured and 17 firefighters missing: 800 people evacuated as smoke billows towards Havana after lightning strikes oil tank#cuba pic.twitter.com/3O0cNATC1l ‚Äî Kyle.Taylor (@livingbyyyz) August 6, 2022\n\nExperts were rushed in from ‚Äòfriendly‚Äô nations such as Venezuela and Mexico during the initial panic. They created a fleet of planes and helicopters that buzzed around the fire like bugs at night, dousing it in foam. Their efforts could not stop the original half-tank fire spreading, but did eventually bring the worst fire disaster in Cuban history under control.\n\nIn the aftermath, Cuba has called on the US Environmental Protection Agency for help wanting access to ‚Äòinnovative US techniques and procedures‚Äô for the cleanup operation. The amount of help offered by the Biden administration is likely to be limited.\n\nThe destroyed fuel tanks formed part of an eight-tank facility that stores part of Cuba‚Äôs vast supply of crude oil ready for transport. Some is sent off to the nation‚Äôs thermoelectric plants ‚Äì one of which had to be shut down. At the time, locals were ‚Äòwarned to wear face masks and avoid acid rain‚Äô as water mixed with toxic fumes. They later saw evidence of black filth appearing all over their residences.\n\nWhile our politicians bicker about whether or not they‚Äôll have to destroy Australia‚Äôs agriculture industry to cut ‚Äòemissions‚Äô, huge tanks full of oil were burned and released directly into the atmosphere.\n\nWhat‚Äôs the carbon footprint for this mess?\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the United Nations going to punish Cuba for endangering the entire planet by bringing on the climate apocalypse?\n\nWhy didn‚Äôt we see climate-panicked school children from Western nations pour onto the streets, crying, screaming, and clutching banners about ‚ÄòCuban climate criminals destroying the world!‚Äô?\n\nYou‚Äôd be hard-pressed to find an Australian school that mentioned the disaster that occurred near Havana, let alone a teacher brave enough to criticise their Left-wing regime.\n\nüìπ| Another Blast in Cuba Oil Warehouse. ‚ñ™Ô∏èFriday‚Äôs thunderstorm caused a giant fire at a crude oil warehouse in #Matanzas, #Cuba. 1 dead, 147 wounded and 14 missing.pic.twitter.com/8Z2NG2T9FY ‚Äî EHA News (@eha_news) August 9, 2022\n\nCuba distanced itself from the world in the 1950s under Fidel Castro and created a communist dictatorship. Their story since then has followed the typical communist collapse of terrible living conditions, blackouts, food shortages, crime, civil unrest, and pitiful healthcare.\n\nBut don‚Äôt worry, the World Wildlife Fund‚Äôs Living Planet Report 2006 listed Cuba as the ‚Äòmost sustainable model of development on the planet‚Äô. It is, apparently, ‚Äòenvironmentally sustainable‚Äô with a ‚Äòhigh quality of life‚Äô.\n\nWhy all the praise? They installed a few solar panels‚Ä¶ That was enough to tip the virtue scales in their favour. It is a game of green shadows and disingenuous ‚Äòscience‚Äô. As world burns, Cuba number 1 for sustainable development: WWF, went the slightly awkward headline in 2016.\n\nDespite the obvious enormous environmental damage caused by this disaster, the propaganda machine that protects everyone except Western companies seems hesitant to criticise Cuba for the mishap.\n\nDelegate for the Ministry of Science, Technology and the Environment, Oscar Garc√≠a Mart√≠nez, notes that ‚Äòair quality‚Äô is the main problem, but that it does not ‚Äòcompromise human health‚Äô.\n\n‚ÄòEverything indicates that what happened in the fire doesn‚Äôt seem to have compromised any aspect for the future,‚Äô they said.\n\nBut what about the imminent climate apocalypse, I hear you say? No one mentioned it. Experts can tell you the carbon footprint of your salad wrap, but not the Cuban fire crisis because ‚Äì uh ‚Äì reasons?\n\nCitizen reports were more honest than official propaganda. According to World Nation News:\n\n‚ÄòIn the days leading up to the fire, it was common to read independent media descriptions of residents in high-risk areas who reported ‚Äúa black spot or powder that stains clothes and hands and leaves an unusual appearance in the water‚Äù. While he warned that in the Yumuri Valley, a few kilometers from the town of Matanjas, ‚Äúthe animals don‚Äôt want to eat the yerba. They chew it and throw it away. We have nowhere to water the animals. Rivers get polluted after the rains.‚Äù‚Äô\n\nDespite the glowing reviews of ‚Äòsustainability‚Äô, 80 per cent of Cuba‚Äôs energy comes from oil and natural gas with almost all of the rest drawn from biofuels. The loss of these four tanks has spread fears of sustained and regular power outages in the months to come.\n\nThe French announced that they would help build the now notorious supertanker hub in 1989 in an agreement between the Bouygues Offshore Group, a Soviet company, and the Cuban oil ministry. While the original base was largely constructed with money from the Soviets, the destroyed tankers were new and built with help from Venezuela. It is no surprise to hear that after the destruction, President of Venezuela Nicol√°s Maduro has put his hand up to say that he will instruct the Ministry of Petroleum to invest in the rebuilding of the Cuban supertanker hub.\n\nUnsurprisingly, instead of worrying about the massive oil fire, Cuba is more concerned about the environmental impact of ‚Ä¶ Covid.\n\n‚ÄòIt is not difficult to predict then that the disease will cause new and greater damage to biodiversity, aggravating the already existing deterioration of ecosystems,‚Äô said Cuba‚Äôs Minister for Science, Technology and the Environment, Elba Rosa P√©rez Montoya.\n\nIt was part of a ploy to get wealthy countries to re-invest in developing countries to save their biodiversity.\n\nSo, while the communist tyrannies of the world burn fossil fuels and complain about their new Climate Change money-making demon of Covid, the rest of us face a future of Veganism and blackouts.",
    "Life Expectancy: The US and Cuba in the Time of Covid": "The article documents that, for the first time, life expectancy in Cuba exceeds that in the US by almost three years. It explores intertwined reasons behind this occurrence, including responses to Covid, health care systems, racism, poverty, misinformation campaigns, the embargo, international solidarity efforts, and resilience to climate change.\n\nRecent data shows that between 2019 and 2021, life expectancy (LE) in the US plunged almost three years while for Cuba it edged up 0.2 years. Yet, in 1960, the year after its revolution, Cuba had a LE of 64.2 years, lower by 5.6 years than that in the US (69.8 years). As I document in Cuban Health Care , the island quickly caught up to the US and, from 1970 through 2016, the two countries were nip and tuck, with some years Cuba and other years the US, having a longer LE. But neither country was ever as much as one year of LE ahead of the other.\n\nLife Expectancy (LE) in US and Cuba, 2017-2021\n\nYear LE US LE Cuba US ‚Äì Cuba 2021 76.1* 79.0 ‚Ä° ‚Äì 2.9 2020 78.8‚Ä† 78.9 ‚Ä° -0.1 2019 79.0* 78.8 ‚Ä° +0.2 2018 78.7‚Ä† 78.7 ‚Ä° 0.0 2017 78.6‚Ä† 78.6 ‚Ä° 0.0\n\nThis continued through the beginning of Covid, which sharply changed the pattern. LE in the US suddenly dropped behind that in Cuba. Bernd Debusmann Jr.of BBC News wrote , LE in the US fell ‚Äúto the lowest level seen since 1996. Government data showed LE at birth now stands at 76.1 compared to 79 in 2019. That is the steepest two-year decline in a century.‚Äù From 2019 to 2020 , ‚ÄúLE declined in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nHow could a country with all the problems of Cuba, actually have LE almost three years greater than the US? There were enormous differences between the way the countries responded to Covid.\n\nThe Covid Contrast\n\nUS Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data confirmed that ‚Äú Covid-19 was the main contributing factor [to changes in LE]. The statistics show that Covid-19 accounted for 50% of the decline between 2020 and 2021. Between 2019 and 2020, the pandemic contributed to 74% of the decline.‚Äù\n\nA critical divergence between the two countries is that Cuba guarantees health care to all as a human right while the US system is based on profit and political grandstanding. When Covid hit, the US dawdled for months as Cuba mobilized for medical action.\n\nThe Ministry of Health developed a national strategy before the island‚Äôs first victim had succumbed to the disease. Cuban TV carried daily press conferences with detailed info on the status of new patients, results of cabinet meetings on Covid, and announcing the best way for citizens to protect themselves and others. Social distancing, masks and contact tracing were universally accepted.\n\nEach day Cuban medical students knocked on doors to ask citizens how they were. Students‚Äô tasks included obtaining survey data from residents and making extra visits to the elderly, infants and those with respiratory problems. Clinic staff dealt with issues that doctors were unable to cope with and sent patients they could not care for to hospitals. Medical data was used by those in the highest decision-making positions of the country. In this way, every Cuban citizen and every health care worker, from those at neighborhood doctor offices through those at the most esteemed research institutes, had a part in determining health policy.\n\nThis inclusive approach resulted in Cuba‚Äôs having 87 Covid deaths by July 21, 2020, when the US had experienced 140,300. While the US population is 30 times that of Cuba, it had 1613 times as many deaths.\n\nTwo aspects of Cuba‚Äôs response to Covid stand out. First, Cuba does NOT have more money to spend on health care. It actually spends less than a tenth as much per person per year than does the US, but it spends that wisely on a holistic system. Second, Cuba‚Äôs health care is global ‚Äì it continued its practice of sending thousands of medical staff to other countries during Covid.\n\nOver the past six decades more than 400,000 Cuban medical professionals have worked in 164 countries and improved the lives of hundreds of millions of people. In addition to providing Cuban doctors with experience coping with diseases and medical issues they do not see at home, this action is positive global diplomacy. US diplomacy, on the other hand, seems to focus on threatening to harm people and/or actually harming them.\n\nIn Addition to Covid\n\nNews stories also mentioned other factors associated with the shorter LE in the US: drug overdoses, heart disease, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis and suicides. The corporate press also acknowledged racial disparities.\n\nThere had been progress in reducing LE differences between Black and white Americans. This was reversed during 2018 ‚Äì 2020 when LE went down 1.36 years for whites, 3.25 years for Hispanics, and 3.88 years for Blacks.\n\nThe fall in US life expectancy was even more pronounced among Native Americans and Alaska Natives. Since 2019, it ‚Äúdropped by 6.6 years, more than twice that of the wider US population.‚Äù\n\nThe US has multiple groups who reject government attempts to vaccinate or wear masks. Most loud-mouthed, of course, are the right wingers who lividly despise the very idea of public health campaigns. While their thought processes are hallucination-based, people of color have reality-based fears of being ignored, lied to, and used for government experimentation, such as the Tuskegee Syphilis Study. There is a strong connection between vaccination hesitation and racism.\n\nWhat They Did Not Look At\n\nAmong factors with increasing US Covid rates ignored by corporate media in the US are poverty, an acute rise in misinformation, abortion, the embargo against Cuba and preparation for climate change.\n\nPoverty . The first task of the Cuban revolution was to simultaneously address poverty, food, sanitation, literacy, education, racism and housing, which the rebels saw as parts of unitary whole. During the Covid crisis, many US corporations were determined to force low wage workers to stay at their jobs, spreading the disease. Cuba told those with Covid to stay home.\n\nMisinformation . Discussions of Covid deaths must not ignore the deadly role of science denial. At the same time Trump was foolishly downplaying mounting dangers of Covid, Cuba was far along developing its ‚ÄúNovel Coronavirus Plan for Prevention and Control.‚Äù Trump was not and is not an isolated individual ‚Äì he manifests a life-threatening movement toward lunacy. Cuba has no significant group which confronts Covid with a bottle of Clorox or expects a cure brought by Q Anon on a flying saucer.\n\nAbortion . Cuba also does not have a ‚ÄúWomen‚Äôs Lives Don‚Äôt Matter!‚Äù movement seeking to eliminate abortion rights. Those who do not want an abortion do not get one and people do not seek to impose their religious and spiritual beliefs on others. The Supreme Court‚Äôs allowing states to criminalize abortion will cause many women to die, due both from self-attempts at abortion and lack of its availability. LE averages are impacted more by deaths of young than elderly; so, we can expect many abortion-induced deaths in US will be among teenagers and young women, which will affect LE.\n\nEmbargo . The ‚Äútrade sanctions‚Äù or ‚Äúblockade‚Äù or ‚Äúembargo‚Äù have a special relationship with LE in Cuba: one might expect it to decrease LE; but it has not done so. When Cuba was reeling from the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, the US passed laws intending to punish those who continued to trade with it. This raised prices in the already impoverished country and has prevented or slowed the arrival of much life-saving medical equipment. Yet, due to its prioritizing health care during the 1990s, Cuba‚Äôs infant mortality decreased while its LE showed a slight increase.\n\nInternational solidarity movements have stepped in to help Cuba overcome many embargo effects. Lack of essential material prevented Cuba from performing liver transplants in children. But, during May 2022, Puentes de Amor (Bridges of Love) delivered the vital chemical compound to the William Soler Pediatric Hospital.\n\nResilience . Avoiding the use of fossil fuels and enormous hydro-, solar- and wind-projects, as Cuba does, will cut down on global destructiveness but have very little effect on reducing climate change on the island. However, preparing for resilience in the face of climate change can hugely affect its quality of life.\n\nIn March 2022 (p. 8) Scientific American editors wrote that most important in preparing for the next pandemic is ‚Äúbuilding new systems.‚Äù Unfortunately, this is what the US is avoiding as it becomes absorbed in making minor tweaks to outmoded, inadequate systems of environmental protection.\n\nCuba has been holding Basti√≥n (bulwark) events involving as many as four million citizens who carry out food production, disease control, sanitation and safeguarding medical supplies. When a policy change is introduced, government representatives go to each community, including the most remote rural ones, to make sure that everyone knows the threats that climate change poses to their lives and how they can alter behaviors to minimize them. They include such diverse actions as conservation with energy use, saving water, preventing fires and using medical products sparingly.\n\nAnother energy positive being expanded in Cuba is farms being run entirely on agroecology principles. Such farms can produce 12 times the energy they consume. Biodigesters break down manure and other biomass to create biogas (very different in Cuba than the US) which is used for tractors or transportation. Vegetable and herb production in Cuba exploded from 4000 tons in 1994 to over four million tons by 2006. This is why Jason Hickel‚Äôs ‚ÄúSustainable Development Index‚Äù rated Cuba‚Äôs ecological efficiency as the best in the world in 2019.\n\nWhere Are We Headed?\n\nThe connection between LE and climate change is becoming increasingly evident. US media stories typically focus on a given disaster such as a flood and mention how aging infrastructure is being neglected. The implication is that if infrastructure were updated to its status of 50 or 100 years ago, that would be adequate. It would not be adequate because climate change means that storms will be more frequent, more intense and more deadly in the future.\n\nBy 2017, Cuba had become the only country with a government-led plan (Project Life, or Tarea Vida) to combat climate change which includes a 100 year projection. While Cuba is looking ahead and planning how to protect people from increasingly devastating storms, US politicians feverishly bury their heads in the sand in subservience to corporate interests, subjecting future generations to ever greater catastrophes.\n\nThis causes LE in the US to plunge down while LE in Cuba climbs slowly upward. Covid did not create the LE divide between the US and Cuba. Covid exacerbated trends which have become increasingly intertwined for decades. The best guess is that these trends will continue well into the future.",
    "Cuba holds unusual vote on law allowing same-sex marriage": "HAVANA (AP) ‚Äî Cuba held a rare referendum Sunday on an unusually contentious law ‚Äî a government-backed ‚Äúfamily law‚Äù code that would allow same-sex couples to marry and adopt, as well as outlining the rights of children and grandparents.\n\nCuba holds parliamentary elections every two years, though no party other than the Communist is allowed, but seldom has it held referendums on specific laws.\n\nAnd seldom has an officially backed measure met as much open criticism as the family law of more than 400 articles, which has been questioned by many members of the island's increasingly vocal evangelical community.\n\nThe sweeping code also would allow surrogate pregnancies, broader rights for grandparents in regard to grandchildren, protection of the elderly and measures against gender violence.\n\nPresident Miguel D√≠az-Canel, who has promoted the law acknowledged resistance as he voted on Sunday.\n\n‚ÄúMost of our people will vote in favor of the code, but it still has issues that our society as a whole does not understand,\" he said. Results of the referendum are expected on Monday.\n\nSixty-four-year-old market vender Miguel Alberto Galindo said he had voted for the measure: ‚ÄúIt's time that homosexuals have the same rights as everyone else,‚Äù he said.\n\nBut Alejandro Rodr√≠guez, a 33-year-old hardware store worker, said he'd voted against the measure, saying, ‚ÄúSome things in the code are good but others are bad.‚Äù He said he did not agree with giving gay couples the same rights as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù families.\n\nThe measure was approved by Cuba's Parliament, the National Assembly, following a thousands of government-organized information sessions this year in neighborhoods across the country.\n\nA major supporter of the measure is Mariela Castro, director of the National Center for Sex Education, a promoter of rights for same-sex couples, daughter of former President Raul Castro and niece of his brother Fidel.\n\nBut there‚Äôs a strong strain of social conservatism in Cuba, where evangelical churches have been growing. Several religious leaders have expressed concern or opposition to the law., worrying it could weaken nuclear families.\n\nWhile Cuba was officially ‚Äî and often militantly ‚Äî atheist for decades after the 1959 revolution led by Fidel Castro ‚Äî Raul‚Äôs brother ‚Äî it has become more tolerant of religions over the past quarter century. That has meant a greater opening not only the once-dominant Roman Catholic Church, but also to Afro-Cuban religions, protestants and Muslims.\n\nSome of those churches took advantage of the opening in 2018 and 2019 to campaign against another plebiscite which would have rewritten the constitution in a way to allow gay marriage.\n\nThe opposition was strong enough that the government at that time backed away.\n\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

He acknowledged that a part of Cuban society still fails to understand some elements contained in the regulations because, in 62 years of the Revolution, patriarchal criteria have persisted in some people and families.\n\nThe head of State added that the process of constructing the Code respected everyone‚Äôs right to an opinion, but he regretted that for reasons of belief a part of the citizenry still does not understand that the law respects the type of family that they defend and also protects the rights of other forms of love.\n\nD√≠az-Canel noted that a strategy of demonization of the Cuban Revolution, of discredit, is also underway, which generates a lot of hatred towards everything related to it, mainly on social networks.\n\nIn this regard, he added that those who are part of this platform use very aggressive language against the Code, but none of it has to do with convictions or opinions, because if it said the opposite, they would still criticize it because it is a legal norm within the Revolution.\n\nD√≠az-Canel highlighted the benefits of the legal document, which gives rights and guarantees to the entire society regardless of the type of family organization.\n\nHe stressed that the Family Code was a necessity since the nation has become more heterogeneous and there were debts from the legal point of view, evident in the life stories told these days, recorded in research works, and in situations discussed in court.\n\nThe new law resolves these issues, said the president, who extolled the participation of the people and experts in the process of building the law, and urged them to read it and interpret it with their hearts, putting themselves in the place of others, of those who have experienced complex situations.\n\nI think that Cuba has grown up, the president emphasized, adding that this is the most important thing, the growth as a society.\n\nPhoto: Estudios Revoluci√≥n\n\nPhoto: Estudios Revoluci√≥n\n\nPhoto: Estudios Revoluci√≥n",

    "Three Crises Merge in Cuba‚Äôs Economy: Causes & Risks": "From Progreso Weekly\n\nBy Julio Carranza (Progreso Weekly)\n\nHAVANA TIMES ‚Äì What follows is a text trying to summarize, in a concrete way, the main factors that affect, characterize and challenge the Cuban economy at this time.\n\nFirstly, we must take into account that the economy has been in crisis mode for a long period of time with some intermittent but insufficient recoveries, which began in the 1990s ‚Äî since the fall of the socialist camp and the disappearance of the USSR, plus the intensification of the U.S. blockade. It all gave rise to the obsolescence of the economic model that, without going into details and nuances now, was essentially inspired by the economies of the socialist countries of Eastern Europe that had been established during the first decades of institutionalization of the revolution, especially in the 70s and 80s. This stage, by the way, corresponded to the period of greatest growth and stability of the economy.\n\nPreviously we have tried to make a periodization of this long stage of crisis that has already lasted for more than three decades until reaching this last critical segment that begins in 2020, when the main economic indicators have once again fallen notably and the standard of living of the population has contracted perhaps as in no other previous period, including the special period of the 1990s. In this case with a different generation and under the leadership of a government that, for logical reasons, does not and could not have the influence, the historical authority and the leadership of the then-government.\n\nFactors affecting the current situation:\n\nThe intensification of the U.S. blockade that, after the important but very brief moment of notable improvement in relations with the U.S. during the end of the Barack Obama administration, has reached strong extremes under the delusional administration of Donald Trump and that, so far, has been essentially unchanged during the first two years of Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe impact of the global COVID 19 pandemic, which for more than two years has meant the almost total loss of income derived from tourism, and the commitment of important and very scarce resources to face its various internal consequences.\n\nThe extraordinary achievement during this period, perhaps the only significant one in this context, was by the Cuban scientific community that quickly and effectively obtained more than one vaccine to guarantee total coverage of the population is remarkable.\n\nThe weight of the external debt, time and time again partially renegotiated with Cuba‚Äôs main creditors (including China and Russia, with whom it was possible to suspend the payment of their service until 2027), but which continues to limit the country‚Äôs access to credit, trade, and international investment.\n\nThe deterioration of the international situation, impacted by the war in Ukraine, which, in economic terms, is characterized by volatility and uncertainty in the markets, as well as by a strong inflationary process worldwide.\n\nFinally, an essential factor of an internal nature is the late, slow and not sufficiently integrated economic reform that the national economy should have.\n\nIf the combination of the above factors is taken into account, it could be stated that the challenges and pressures have been enormous and the response has not been up to the task and with the certainty and agility required. Although the resistance capacity that the country has shown in the face of difficulties and aggression must be recognized, despite moments of increased social tension.\n\nThree crises at once\n\nTrying to dissect the current situation, it could be said that the national economy faces at least three crises that overlap and reinforce each other in the same time and space:\n\n1. The structural crisis of the economic model:\n\nAs we stated earlier, beyond the discussion of whether or not it was the best option, the reality is that for years the Cuban economy established a model for organizing the economy inspired by the socialist economies of Eastern Europe and accompanied by a process of integration in the economic space that they formed with the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CAME).\n\nThe disappearance of that world and the closure of the economic space that had allowed Cuba to largely overcome the isolation imposed by the U.S. blockade, made evident from very early on in the 90s the need for a fundamental economic reform of the economy, not to abandon its socialist horizon, but to adapt it to the new and difficult international conditions. Contributing and discussing that necessary change is what motivated our book published in Havana in 1995, ‚ÄúCuba: Restructuring the Economy: A Contribution to the Debate‚Äù (Carranza, Guti√©rrez and Monreal). However, beyond specific changes, some of them certainly very important, up to now the model of organization of the national economy has not been restructured to the extent needed and with the necessary depth.\n\nAfter almost two decades of debates and above all the accumulation of evidence, the party congresses discussed and approved documents that opened the political space to advance in the necessary economic reform, mainly ‚ÄúThe conceptualization of the economic model,‚Äù the ‚ÄúGuidelines‚Äù and finally the new Constitution of the Republic approved by the majority vote of the population. However, the measures for change were adopted slowly (if not late) and without sufficient comprehensiveness, which has delayed and continues to delay the articulation of the only strategic solution that, in our opinion, the Cuban socialist economy has in overcoming the immense challenges it faces and the enormous pressures that oppose it.\n\nEssential to the process is the integrating the different economic actors based on their various forms of ownership and management, a deep reform of the state company (leader of the system), reform of the agricultural production subsystem, modification of the relationship between planning and the market, move the economic model towards greater decentralization, construction of markets ‚Äî including the means of production and monetary markets ‚Äî with their corresponding regulations, an active monetary, exchange and fiscal policy economically based and rigorously implemented, a focused and effective social policy, an investment policy that respond to national priorities, etc. and everything in the right sequence.\n\nThe reform of the state company is a key point. Make changes, both in their internal organization (so that they better express the interests of their owner, which is the people), as well as the ways in which they relate to each other and to the rest of the economic actors, to create the conditions that allow them to raise their efficiency, which today, in general terms, is at clearly low levels.\n\nA more dynamic economy is needed with greater autonomy and in a competitive context and strong financial restrictions. The leadership of the state company in the national economy should not and cannot be established by ‚Äúdecree,‚Äù but rather the result of its scale, efficiency and profitability.\n\nThe proper operation of the markets, with the necessary regulations, including the money market, is impossible without a reformed state company that allows it to attend to them without causing strong distortions. The markets must integrate all the economic actors (state, cooperative and private, plus foreign investment companies), under the leadership of the state company, which must also respond to a more strategic and financial planning than traditional bureaucratic planning that has affected the socialist economies, the Cuban one included.\n\nThe macroeconomic crisis\n\nSecond, the precipitated macroeconomic crisis after 2020, with the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic ‚Äî in a two year period the economy contracted more than 13%, with a very slight recovery of 1.3% during the last year ‚Äî imports were drastically and abruptly reduced, with which the scarcity of practically everything invaded the spaces of the national economy, generating multiple difficulties and growing discomfort in the population.\n\nAll marketing spaces have been characterized over the last two and a half years by a sustained shortage and permanent queues, more in those that offer products in national currency, but also in those that offer in MLC, the latter more difficult to understand since it is a segment that can finance itself and sustain the flow of foreign exchange that favors the economy. (In this sense, and as several economists have been proposing for some time, a greater liberalization of the wholesale and retail markets has recently been decided, a measure still to be implemented.)\n\nThe most evident expression of this dimension of the crisis is the galloping inflation and the monetary chaos that remains and grows in the country as a result of the contraction of the economy and also of the insufficiencies and inaccuracies with which the economic policy has been conducted during the last two and a half years, including how the so-called ‚Äúmonetary order‚Äù ‚Äî started in January 2021 ‚Äî was conceived and implemented.\n\nWe have expanded on the reasons for the impact of this on the growth of inflation in previous articles. The causes of inflation are not only in the economic and monetary policy, without a doubt there are also external factors, but the internal economic policy has fueled it notably.\n\nOn the one hand, the multiplication of business costs with the devaluation of the national currency from January 2021, and then, trying to compensate for the rise in prices with an excessive expansion of demand with the increase in various incomes and the distribution of ‚Äúutilities‚Äù without the productive support and precise calculations that allow maintaining macroeconomic balances and keeping the fiscal deficit under control, essential factors for the stability and growth of any economy.\n\nThe strong expansion of demand in an economy such as Cuba‚Äôs, where the country‚Äôs industrial and productive base in general, including agriculture, is so affected, while still tied by clearly unjustified limitations (in addition to pressure from the blockade), makes the response to that monetary expansion not productive but inflationary, it does not exist, so that it can be quickly activated, what Keynesians called ‚Äúmultiplication factor‚Äù.\n\nHence the importance of the underestimated sequentiality and comprehensiveness of the reform. Before multiplying costs and expanding demand, conditions must be created for the recovery of supply via production with adequate progress in the comprehensive economic reform, including the consolidation of the different economic actors, including the emerging private sector of SMEs and cooperatives, as well as and essentially, we insist, the reform of the state company, also with a part of the available foreign exchange dedicated to maintain essential imports, especially medicines, food and certain means of production, even when this implies a reduction in the rate of investment in sectors such as tourism.\n\nIn other words, of course, the establishment of an integrated exchange market and monetary order must be a very important component of the reform, but not in any way, with any order, or at any time.\n\nAdded to the regulations are the recent measures for the establishment of a market for the purchase and sale of currencies, but it is being carried out again in a partial, limited and disintegrated manner, which has motivated a new spiral of growth in the price of foreign currency in the parallel market, with all its implications, among them the rise of inflation, which mainly affects the lower-income sectors, which in Cuba affects the largest sector of the population.\n\nIt should be noted that certain official prices (including fuel and other services and products offered in the state network) have maintained their level anchored in the exchange of 1 USD for 24 CUP, which was established in January 2021. However, due to the new official parallel rate OF 1 USD for 120 CUP, plus the informal one that is already around 150 CUP, it turns out that for holders of foreign currency or MLC (not the majority of the population that only receives national currency and therefore deals with low incomes), these products and services have, via the exchange rate, a comparatively low price (gasoline is a typical case), which causes significant losses to the state. It is the expression of the great distortion of the money market that this process has created.\n\nMonetary policy is a fundamental instrument of economic policy and also of social policy. It cannot be treated simply as a mechanism for ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù of foreign currency because these negative distortions are generated. Previously we had stated that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãevaluating the possibility of investing a few million dollars to expand and bring the money market under control ‚Äî of course there is not enough foreign currency ‚Äî is not a minor matter. It is a fundamental factor in contributing to put the foreign exchange market and inflation under greater control ‚Äî a fundamental social priority. It might even be possible to obtain international credits for this purpose. It is a subject as complex as it is essential, so a discussion about it with the corresponding specialists, calculating and reviewing the data, would be very convenient.\n\nOn the other hand, continuing to seek and apply various ways to alleviate the pressure of the external debt is also a factor of great importance, including the exchange of debt for investment, bond issuance, etc. Without payment guarantees there is no possibility of obtaining the resources that the country needs through credit and investment. This is a critical point.\n\nThe country‚Äôs economists have talked a lot, and rightly so, about the need for a more balanced investment policy adjusted to national priorities where the agricultural sector stands out for its role in guaranteeing the food security of the population, now notably affected.\n\nAccording to calculations made by economists, between 2 billion and 2.5 billion dollars of investment per year would be necessary to sustain a GDP growth rate of more than 5% per year. The current level is very far from that figure. This supposes greater incentives and policy updates for foreign investment, including aspects such as direct payment to workers hired by investors, etc. But to return to our essential point, an economic model that works in an integrated and efficient manner is also decisive in this matter, including the existence and functionality of structures such as financial services, insurance, post, connectivity. Do they exist? Yes. Do they work effectively? No.\n\nThe sectoral crisis\n\nAdded to the two previous dimensions of the crisis is the specific crisis in important sectors of the economy: mainly energy and agriculture.\n\nThe former is affected not only by prices and difficulties in accessing fuel, but also, and very importantly, by the lack of sufficient foresight in the maintenance cycles of the country‚Äôs main power plants, as well as in fuel tanks, which is the reason for constant breakages and accidents. Are they causes or risks?\n\nOf course, the lack of foreign currency and the blockade limits the proper maintenance and capital repairs, but it is a factor that the economy must have enough time and include in its strategic plans. There is not only an economic problem in this, there is also a national security problem.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning here that the insufficient progress in the installation of alternative energy sources that contribute to changing the national energy matrix. Cuba still has an immense space and conditions to advance in this field.\n\nOn the other hand, the crisis in the agricultural sector, which despite having benefited from a set of liberalizing measures has not yet had the strategic transformation it needs. That is, as we have stated on other occasions, what is needed is a profound change of the agricultural production subsystem as part of the general and comprehensive reform of the economy. ‚ÄúA group of measures‚Äù is not enough, no matter how positive they may be. The incentives, links and forms of management in the entire agricultural sector, from production and distribution to marketing and consumption, must be fully transformed.\n\nThe country cannot allow itself to have strong limitations in the supply of food and at the same time idle land and other lands with productivity levels far below those that could be obtained, even taking into account the strong limitations imposed by the blockade.\n\nMention should also be made here of the deterioration of the traditional sugar sector, whose current production levels are still insufficient even to cover national demand.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is imperative that the economic strategy and the economic policy respond to these three crises at the same time, with the integrality and the necessary sequence, without the solutions to the emergencies dismantling or hindering the strategic solution that is, I insist, in the integral and deep transformation of the organization of the economic model, preserving its character of justice and social inclusion, complex and difficult, yes, impossible, no. The future of the country is at stake. Time runs fast and is a critical variable.\n\n*Julio Carranza, PhD in Economic Sciences, is considered among the most lucid Cuban specialists.\n\nRead more from Cuba here on Havana Times.",

    "Cuba‚Äôs Family Code Referendum Is Sparking Deep Debates": "On September 25, Cuba will hold just its fourth national referendum since the 1959 Revolution. The vote, which will decide the fate of the government‚Äôs proposed New Family Code, is generating intense debate. Many voters will cast their ballots based not on the content of the Code, but rather their views on the government and the referendum process itself.\n\nAmid a severe economic downturn, much of the public is struggling to access medicine, electricity and even a basic diet. Meanwhile, the administration of President Miguel D√≠az-Canel is scrambling to improve its international image even as it prosecutes a prolonged crackdown on civil society and political opposition. In the wake of the massive anti-government demonstrations of July 11, 2021, over 1,400 alleged participants have been arrested. All of this has precipitated a massive exodus; record numbers of Cubans are attempting to reach the U.S., Spain and other countries.\n\nMany opponents of the government say they will vote against the Family Code to deny the D√≠az-Canel administration a victory that might improve its international image and distract from this backdrop of economic and social crisis. For its part, the government claims noble intentions with the referendum. In the last two referenda on modifications to the constitution, in 2018 and 2019, conservatives prevented marriage equality and other LGBTQ rights from being codified.\n\nNow, the Code would guarantee rights to marriage equality and surrogate pregnancies. It would also codify domestic violence penalties; extend labor rights to those who care full-time for children, the elderly, or people with disabilities; and allow for parental rights to be shared among extended and nontraditional family structures that could include grandparents, stepparents and surrogate mothers.\n\nThose in favor of the Code say it promotes equality by guaranteeing basic rights. Some opponents cite religious objections or discomfort with shifting gender roles or identities, while others are concerned about the Code‚Äôs language around child abuse and education. It would outlaw corporal punishment or ‚Äúany other kind of violence, abuse or inappropriate forms of discipline.‚Äù It also includes a parental duty to educate children to respect authorities and ‚Äúlove of family,‚Äù ‚Äúthe homeland‚Äù and ‚Äúits symbols.‚Äù It would also make it easier for anyone to report physical or verbal abuse of minors to law enforcement.\n\nSome fear the government will abuse these stipulations to separate dissidents from their children. The new Penal Code includes a similar stipulation, forbidding anyone from encouraging a minor ‚Äúnot to fulfill their duties related to respect for and love of the homeland.‚Äù The government has recently used such laws to incarcerate parents for attempting to homeschool their children.\n\nCritics of the referendum also say that in leaving this decision up to a popular vote, the legislature is abdicating its own responsibility to pass laws that guarantee rights, promote equality and protect minorities. This may serve two purposes, they say. First, if the Code is rejected, the government can simply ‚Äúwash its hands‚Äù of gender and sexuality discrimination and ignore the issue. Second, the act of calling a referendum as opposed to simply passing legislation seems performative. After all, Cuban authorities recently approved the new Penal Code and Decree Law 370, which restricts freedom of expression, without referenda. Critics say the government chose to submit the Family Code to a vote only in order to boost the image of Cuba‚Äôs system of ‚Äúdemocratic centralism.‚Äù\n\nThrough this system, the government has sponsored many rounds of discussions about the Code in workplace and local government councils. Officials say they take note of the points made in these discussions and elevate them up decision-making channels. The government has modified its proposal two dozen times, supposedly based on feedback from these discussions. However, there is little transparency in how these decisions are made, and there is no watchdog or auditing body to oversee them. Even so, the government has been praising this system of consultation in the media as its political leadership seeks to show ‚Äúgreater closeness to the people.‚Äù\n\nIf it passes, the Code will also allow the government to posture as aligned with the international left on gender and LGBTQ issues, even as it continues its crackdown on dissent and freedom of expression. For now, the international community continues to condemn the government‚Äôs prosecution and jailing of dissidents, some of them minors, since the July 11 demonstrations.\n\nThe D√≠az-Canel administration seems bent on improving its reputation‚Äîbut without softening its repression of political dissent. This may drive many voters who support much of the content of the Code to vote against it.\n\nTurnout is almost always high in Cuba, because authorities generally view abstention as subversive and can easily identify those who don‚Äôt vote. This is why most people who wish to protest a vote will turn in blank ballots instead of refusing to cast a ballot. Many others vote in line with the government to avoid the problems that come with being identified as a possible dissident.\n\nWhen the votes are tallied in the referendum on the Family Code, observers should keep in mind that the results will reflect much more than simply how people feel about its contents.\n\n‚Äî\n\nGarc√≠a is head of monitoring, evaluation and impact at the Cuban independent media outlet El Toque and is communications lead at the Transparency and Accountability Initiative",

Jose Enriquez, Mission Command Training Program, delivers remarks during the National Hispanic Heritage Month observance Sept. 20 at the Frontier Conference Center. (Photo Credit: Prudence Siebert) VIEW ORIGINAL\n\nFORT LEAVENWORTH, Kan. ‚Äî Maj. Jos√© Enriquez, an observer/coach/trainer with the Fort Leavenworth-based Mission Command Training Program, shared the impact of his experience growing up in Cuba and immigrating to the United States on the Mariel Boat Lift in 1980 during the National Hispanic Heritage Month observance Sept. 20 at the Frontier Conference Center.\n\nEnriquez began his remarks with a brief overview of Cuban history and the island‚Äôs proximity to Key West, Florida. Both factors are relevant to the influx of immigration that led his family and many others to the United States.\n\nEnriquez explained that Cuba‚Äôs previously free economy ‚Äî which included opportunities for employment, property rights and upward mobility ‚Äî belonged to a heavily corrupt government under the leadership of an elitist military dictator, Fulgencio Batista. Fidel Castro revolutionized the Cuban population against Batista and installed a Marxist‚ÄìLeninist one-party socialist republic on Jan. 1, 1959.\n\nIn 1970s Cuba, Enriquez and his family lived near the Port of Mariel, a deep-water port about an hour from Havana, the nation's capital. Enriquez explained that two years into Castro‚Äôs rule, families received annual booklets known as \"Libreta de Abastecimiento\" based on each family‚Äôs size and age through which they could claim supplies monthly at a registered store; the ration system is still in place today. In addition to necessary commodities. Enriquez said toys were also rationed. He said his grandfather ‚Äúdonated‚Äù acreage to the local government in order to keep part of his family‚Äôs land, including a vegetable garden, fruit trees and sugar cane that helped feed his family.\n\nGuest speaker Maj.

(Photo Credit: Prudence Siebert) VIEW ORIGINAL\n\nEnriquez said around 20 years later, the Cuban government actively persecuted anyone labeled counter-revolutionary or in dissent of Castro. On April 1, 1980, five Cubans sought asylum by driving a bus through the fence of the Peruvian embassy and Cuban police exchanged fire with embassy guards, expediting the push for mass emigration. Castro removed the guards there, and more than 10,000 Cubans crowded into the Peruvian embassy seeking asylum, prompting him to ask other nations to receive Cubans he deemed as undesirable.\n\n‚ÄúOnce it became known that you were planning to leave Cuba, you were immediately labeled a ‚ÄòTraitor to the Revolution‚Äô by the government and called an ‚Äòescoria‚Äô (scum). Your ration card would be confiscated; your job terminated; if you were in school, you would be expelled immediately. And by the time you left the Port of Mariel, any property you owned had already been inventoried and taken by the government. The Cuban government also organized acts of repudiation against those who wished to leave the island,‚Äù Enriquez said.\n\nBetween April 15 and Oct. 31 of 1980, more than 125,000 migrants traveled the 120 miles from the Port of Mariel to the United States on several hundred boats picking up Cuban refugees, including a 4-year-old Enriquez and his family.\n\n‚ÄúAccording to my Cuban passport, my immigrant Visa was stamped on May 13, 1980, which is the day we left, but I was not in-processed in Key West until May 18, 1980. I assumed it was due to procedural delay at Key West, but when I asked my dad and oldest sister if they can explain the gap, they told me it was because we were lost at sea for three or four days. It turns out that shortly after departing the Port of Mariel we ran into a bad thunderstorm and the captain lost his way,‚Äù Enriquez said. ‚ÄúBy then, we had run out of food, most of us were dehydrated and were on the brink, but once the boat captain finally made it back to the correct sea lanes, we were air-dropped rations by Coast Guard helicopters.‚Äù\n\nCuban-born guest speaker Maj.

Nobody claimed his family upon arrival in Key West, and after five days, they moved into the Miami Orange Bowl stadium. Enriquez and his family moved into a tent city under the I-95 overpass after a month at the Miami Orange Bowl without a sponsor. He described the refugee camp as dangerous; he said violence and crime, including rape and theft, were common.\n\nAfter another month, a distant relative claimed his family and they moved to Hialeah, Florida, until his parents moved the family to an apartment complex.\n\n‚ÄúHialeah in the early 80s was particularly dangerous and gang infested, and that apartment complex was the epicenter. It was so dangerous that it was nicknamed ‚ÄòVietnam.‚Äô If you told anyone in Miami that you lived in ‚ÄòVietnam,‚Äô they knew exactly what you meant,‚Äù Enriquez said.\n\n‚ÄúWe spent the better part of the 1980s moving, in the cover of night, from one apartment to the next before the deposit month ran out. Back then, you weren‚Äôt asked to leave and then taken to court; you were forcibly removed from the premises by police and your stuff was unceremoniously tossed into the street. It was not uncommon to see couches, TVs, and beds flying out from an upper-story balcony.‚Äù\n\nEnriquez emphasized his disdain for the place, but that he was still grateful to be in a different circumstance.\n\n‚ÄúDespite all that, life was good, and we didn‚Äôt complain at all. We were grateful for the generous monthly supply of government food, and we were given food stamps on top of that. It took us the whole month just to get through a block of cheese,‚Äù Enriquez said.\n\nGuest speaker Maj.

    "The largest mass emigration in Cuba‚Äôs history continues": "A Cuban stands with his makeshift raft on a beach near Havana. ADALBERTO ROQUE (AFP)\n\nCuba‚Äôs latest migration crisis is breaking records. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) reports that in the last 11 months, nearly 180,000 Cubans crossed the US-Mexico border, and another 8,000 tried to make it to the United States by sea. In addition, the US Coast Guard reports that it intercepted 5,421 Cuban rafters trying to cross the Florida Straits since October 2021, and about 3,000 made it to US shores, numbers that exceed the total number of rafters detained in the last five years. The current Cuban exodus is unprecedented and far surpasses previous mass emigrations like the 1980 Mariel boatlift (125,000 people) and the 1994 Cuban rafter crisis (35,000 people).\n\nThe Cuban sociologists and economists we interviewed all agree that the hemorrhaging will not be stanched anytime soon and may even worsen due to deteriorating living conditions and economic hardship in Cuba. They believe that the current crisis is structural and that it will take years of investment, financial aid and radical reforms for the country to recover, measures that the Cuban government may be reluctant to take.\n\nMore information The US embargo against Cuba turns 60 with no policy change on the horizon\n\nCuban and US news outlets publish daily reports of deportations, shipwrecks, human trafficking operations and harrowing accounts of the land and sea journeys made by these Cuban emigrants. Hundreds have been killed by the mafias that control illegal migration in Central America and Mexico, while others have drowned at sea or crossing the Rio Grande. But this hasn‚Äôt deterred the desperate people who continue to leave Cuba.\n\nThe US Embassy in Cuba recently announced that the US is increasing patrols and enforcement by land, air and sea, as well as a new ‚Äúinteragency task force responsible for deterring, preventing, and responding to illegal maritime migration under Operation Vigilant Sentry. The primary objectives of the task force are to prevent loss of life at sea and to deter and dissuade maritime migration using Department of Homeland Security forces.‚Äù\n\nCuban television reporters recently interviewed several rafters deported from the US, including a young woman with a small child, who told how they nearly died at sea. They vowed not to try and emigrate illegally again, sending a clear message of deterrence to viewers. But it is unlikely that this will resonate with the desperate, exhausted and disillusioned Cuban people.\n\nThe crisis led Cuba and the US to convene a ‚Äútechnical meeting‚Äù in Havana between the Cuban Border Guard and the US Coast Guard to ‚Äúincrease bilateral cooperation‚Äù in combatting irregular migration, human and drug trafficking, as well as maritime search and rescue.\n\nThe official Cuban communiqu√© about the meeting said it was fruitful and conducted ‚Äúin a respectful and professional atmosphere‚Ä¶ Both delegations noted the usefulness of these meetings and the importance of increased cooperation in this area,‚Äù and agreed to hold more technical meetings in the future. In April, Cuba and the US resumed bilateral talks on migration issues, the first high-level discussions since US President Joe Biden was elected. The meetings had been suspended during the Trump administration, which reversed the Obama-initiated rapprochement between the two countries.\n\nImmigration has always been a key issue in the turbulent US-Cuba bilateral relationship. Over the last 60 years, several mass emigrations have ratcheted up tensions between the two nations. Cuba has used emigration as an escape valve during times of economic and political crisis, and also to pressure the US. But the magnitude of the current exodus is unprecedented, and led to historic anti-government protests on July 11, 2021. That date established a before-and-after point in time for Cuba, and the emigration numbers speak for themselves.\n\nIn fiscal year 2020 (year ending on September 30), 14,000 Cubans illegally entered the US across the Mexican border. In FY 2021, this number increased to 39,300. As of August 2022, almost 180,000 migrants have entered the US across its southern border. If the current pace continues, US officials say FY 2022 could close with a record 200,000 irregular Cuban migrants. The US Coast Guard data on Cuban rafters is equally alarming. The number of Cubans intercepted at sea bounced around for years (1,468 in 2017; 259 in 2018; 313 in 2019; 49 in 2020; and 838 in 2021), but in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, US officials picked up 5,421 Cubans at sea.\n\nThis is undoubtedly the most severe migration crisis since the Cuban Revolution triumphed in 1959. The problems in Cuba that are driving the exodus are equally severe and difficult to solve. There seems no end in sight for the widespread exhaustion and desperation of the Cuban people caused by economic hardship, draconian energy blackouts, runaway inflation, medicine and basic necessity shortages, and deteriorating health care services. Many young people feel that leaving is their only option for a better life, a scenario that will surely mortgage the country‚Äôs future.\n\nThe Biden administration does not want more irregular Cuban emigrants, and has recently launched several initiatives to resurrect the family reunification program and restore the consular services that Trump dismantled. But Cuban officials say that these measures are inadequate and accuse Washington of accelerating the flow of illegal emigrants by failing to comply with the bilateral agreement stipulating the granting of 20,000 visas annually to Cuban citizens. Cuba also says that the US has not complied with the Cuban Adjustment Act, which allows Cubans to obtain permanent residency a year and a day after entering the country, even if they entered illegally. Lastly, Cuba continues to blame US economic sanctions for all its problems. While both governments remain mired in long-running disputes, Cubans continue to suffer and the exodus intensifies.",

    "US Migration from Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua Soars in August": "The number of Venezuelans, Cubans and Nicaraguans taken into custody at the U.S. border with Mexico soared in August as migrants from Mexico and traditional sending countries were stopped less frequently, authorities said Monday.\n\nU.S. authorities stopped migrants from Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua about 56,000 times last month, up from 49,826 times in July and 23,141 times in August 2021, according to administration officials. At the same time, fewer migrants were stopped from Mexico and the Central American ‚ÄúNorthern Triangle‚Äù countries of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras for a third straight month.\n\nOverall, migrants were stopped about 203,000 times. They were stopped 199,976 times on the U.S. border with Mexico in July and 213,593 times in August 2021.\n\nThe growing numbers from Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua, are the latest sign of rapidly changing migration flows as U.S. authorities wrestle with unusually large influxes.\n\nWhile no single reason can be pinpointed, it is extremely challenging for the U.S. to expel migrants from those countries under a pandemic-era rule known as Title 42, which U.S. officials invoke to deny a chance at seeking asylum on grounds of preventing the spread of COVID-19. U.S. relations with all three countries are deeply strained, making it difficult to impossible to send them home.\n\nMexico agrees to accept migrants expelled under Title 42 if they are from Guatemala, Honduras or El Salvador, in addition to Mexico. While the rule applies to all nationalities in theory, people from those four countries are most affected.\n\nThe Biden administration has leaned on other countries in the Americas to absorb more people fleeing their homes, including Mexico, Costa Rica, which is home to many Nicaraguans, and Colombia, which has taken in millions of Venezuelans in recent years.\n\nVenezuelan migration plummeted early this year after Mexico introduced restrictions on air travel but has increased in recent months as more come over land through the notoriously dangerous Darien Gap in Panama.\n\nIn July, Venezuelans were stopped 17,651 times on the U.S. border with Mexico, most of them in and around Eagle Pass and Del Rio, Texas.\n\nReminders of their presence are in daily headlines. The roughly 50 migrants that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis flew to the upscale Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard were all Venezuelan, as were five of the six bodies that U.S. authorities found drowned to death in the Rio Grande near Eagle Pass on Labor Day weekend. The sixth was from Nicaragua.",

    "Humanitarian Crisis In Cuba: One Year On From The Anti-Government Protest": "In early July, 2021, thousands of Cubans took the streets in protest against the authoritarian Cuban government which was failing to not only combat the ongoing Covid pandemic, but also address the growing food shortages and severe blackouts plaguing the island country. Now a year later, trials for the 1,400 arrested and the ongoing fallout from the protests have raised concerns over human rights violations throughout the international community. Much of the concerns have centered specifically around the treatment of La G√ºinera, a poor and predominantly black neighborhood outside of Havana. Of the 700 who were given prison sentences, 100 were just from this neighborhood alone and the one casualty of the protests was a black man shot by the authorities in La G√ºinera.\n\nPrison sentences have been as high as 25 years ranging anywhere from accusations of vandalism to outright sedition. In an article by the BBC, a father of one of the convicted protesters spoke out about the severe injustice of many of the trials. His son, 22 and from La G√ºinera, has learning difficulties but was convicted of sedition and sentenced to 12 years of prison time, only allowing government witnesses to be used in the trial. Other instances included even false identification of protestors from obscured footage and trying large groups of people together at the same time. Even before the trials themselves, according to a report published by the Human Rights Watch, there have been instances of arbitrary detentions, abuse during prosecution, and even torture. Many in Cuba as well as the international community believe that the Cuban government is purposefully making an example out of La G√ºinera in order to discourage any other future uprisings.\n\nLeonardo Fern√°ndez, an arrested protester from another part of Cuba told the BBC, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs sad to see 20-year prison terms being handed down to 19-year-old kids. There are cases in which the sentences exceed the length of the convicted person‚Äôs life. It‚Äôs a human tragedy, and one which the international community needs to sit up and take notice of.‚Äù As the Cuban government prosecutes those who protested last July, it has ignored the reasons why the protest happened in the first place. The economic crisis has only worsened and now many have chosen to flee the island. According to the New York Times, migration from Cuba to the U.S. has reached its highest level in four decades. A longtime Cuban dissident told the New York Times, ‚ÄúHere, whoever doesn‚Äôt leave, it‚Äôs because they can‚Äôt.‚Äù\n\nAs human rights abuses continue to be committed in Cuba, the international community must take action to not only denounce and punish the actions of the Cuban government but to also provide critical aid to those who are fleeing. Between just this past January and May, more than 118,000 Cubans were detained in the U.S. compared to the 17,400 for the same time period last year. As the number of those who are detained rises, so does the overall number of people who are risking their lives in attempts to flee to the U.S. Action must be taken by the U.S. government in order to show its allegiance to the humanitarian plights of the Cuban people. This can be done through politics as well as further trade restrictions with Cuba. As for the refugee crisis, similar measures to those taken for Afghanistan and Ukraine should be applied to Cuba. As a close neighbor to the U.S. and as a country which has also had a complex relationship with the U.S., humanitarian aid measures should also be the same.\n\nSince the Cuban Revolution from 1953-1959 where the communist party of Cuba came to power, migration between Cuba and the United States has increased. The rise of Communism so close to U.S. shores sent a panic through the American government and people as the Cold War began. U.S. meddling during the Cuban revolution also put a strain on U.S.-Cuban relations. This gave birth to many of the policies with Cuba which still exist today, including the U.S. embargo. Harsh isolation of the Cuban economy wreaked irreparable damage to the country as a whole which has lasted into today. Though it was not the only factor, the U.S. did play a hand in Cuba‚Äôs current state.\n\nTherefore it is in fact in part the United States‚Äô responsibility to provide aid to the Cuban people. As the humanitarian crisis escalates in Cuba, similar approaches should be taken by the United States and other global powers to the international responses to both Afghanistan and Ukraine.",

Havana supports the series of important proposals from the Chinese side, including the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative, he added.\n\nCuba will continue to firmly abide by the one-China principle and unwaveringly support China's stance on issues related to Taiwan, Hong Kong and Xinjiang, Rodriguez said, adding that his country opposes any and all politically motivated anti-China moves.\n\nWang said the international situation right now is full of crises and chaos, but good prevails evil, unity is strength, and persistence leads to victory.

    "More migrants are coming from dictatorships like Venezuela and Cuba": "It took nearly a month for Fabricio Hoyos to make the dangerous and uncertain trek from Venezuela to the United States. But as he arrived at a migrant processing center recently, he had another long journey ahead: the process of seeking asylum.\n\nCBS News national correspondent Manuel Bojoquez spoke to Hoyos at the migrant processing center, located in El Paso, Texas, where around 1,500 migrants are seen each day. About half of those being seen at the center are coming from Venezuela.\n\nThey are part of what U.S. Customs and Border Protection have called a \"new wave\" of migration. 157,921 people were encountered at borders nationwide last month, according to the agency ‚Äî a 2.2% increase from the month before.\n\n\"Failing communist regimes in Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Cuba are driving a new wave of migration across the Western Hemisphere, including the recent increase in encounters at the southwest U.S. border,\" CBP Commissioner Chris Magnus said this week in a statement.\n\nHe added that \"those fleeing repressive regimes pose significant challenges for processing and removal.\"\n\nAt the center in El Paso, migrants are screened and vetted, and identified and classified, according U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesperson Landon Hutchens. They ‚Äî along with people coming from Nicaragua and Cuba ‚Äî are processed under Title 8 authorities, said Hutchens. That usually allows them to be released and request asylum, a process that typically takes years to complete.\n\nBut not everyone is allowed in. According to Customs and Border Protection, more than 1.3 million migrants have been deported or expelled so far this year. It's a number greater than those still in the United States.\n\nStill, critics say the Biden administration's policies incentivize migrant crossings.",
