    "How great partnerships can lead to effective service delivery in Bangladesh": "These achievements are not without its challenges. Health facilities can easily be overwhelmed, as was the case during the usually high outbreak of dengue fever this year. Similarly, earlier this year, when a fire broke out, it led to 70 beds in the SARI ITC being destroyed. It highlights the degree of vulnerability and the risks that continue to constrain service delivery efforts.\n\nThe close collaboration between the government and partners will continue to be crucial in developing and sustaining critical service delivery systems for both the DRPs and the host communities. The provision of family planning services at the Camp 3 primary health care center, which I also had the chance to visit, is a terrific example of how partnerships can lead to beneficial results – with the government providing the facility while UN agencies like International Organization for Migration, United Nations Population Fund, World Health Organization, United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the World Bank crowdsourcing the provision of equipment, technical assistance, and renovation support. The DRPs and the host communities' lives are being positively impacted as a direct result of this support from The World Bank.\n\nI am hoping to talk to more people like Jannatul and Mohammed in the future to continue to gauge our impact on the ground.",
    "Death toll in Bangladesh boat tragedy rises to 51, dozens missing": "Boat packed with Hindu devotees sinks in a river in the worst waterways disaster to hit the country in more than a year.\n\nAt least 51 people have been killed and dozens feared missing after a boat packed with Hindu devotees sank in Bangladesh, officials said, in the worst waterways disaster to hit the country in more than a year.\n\nThe small boat packed with mostly women and children on their way to a popular temple flipped over in the Karatoya river on Sunday as onlookers screamed in horror from the shore near Boda town in the northern Panchagarh district.\n\n“Twenty five people are still missing,” district magistrate Dipankar Roy told Anadolu news agency, while also confirming the death toll.\n\nOn duty emergency officials told Anadolu that the rescue operation was suspended for Monday night and will resume Tuesday morning.\n\nDistrict police chief Sirajul Huda earlier said seven bodies were found in the river. Police said the boat was carrying around 90 people, more than 50 being Hindu pilgrims on their way to the temple on the occasion of Mahalaya, when Hindus make offerings to their ancestors.\n\n“It was carrying three times its capacity. There were heavy rains in the morning and that is why when the ferrying began, pilgrims packed the boat to make it quickly to the temple,” Huda said.\n\n“The boatman asked some people to disembark in an effort to ease the weight-load. But no one listened,” he added.\n\nThe bodies recovered so far included 16 women and 10 children, said Jahurul Islam, district administrator of Panchagarh. He said the authorities were compiling the list of the missing based on information provided by the relatives.\n\nA five-member committee is investigating the incident and they suspect overcrowding caused the accident, he said.\n\nSunday marked the start of the Durga Puja, the biggest Hindu festival in Bangladesh and other parts of South Asia. Thousands of Hindus in Muslim-majority Bangladesh visit the Bodeshwari Temple on the occasion.\n\nThe incident in the country’s remote north was the latest in a string of similar tragedies blamed on poor maintenance and overcrowding in the low-lying delta country with extensive inland waterways.\n\nAt least 26 people died in May after an overcrowded speedboat collided with a sand-laden bulk carrier and sank on the Padma River.\n\nIn December, nearly 50 people were killed and more than 70 injured when a ferry caught fire in the southern rural town of Jhalokati.\n\nA ferry sank in Dhaka in June 2020 after a collision with another vessel, killing dozens of people.\n\nAt least 78 people died in February 2015 when an overcrowded ship collided with a cargo vessel in a river west of the capital.",
    "Tensions as Bangladesh accuses Myanmar of firing in its territory": "Weeks of firing from Myanmar escalates tensions between the neighbours, raising concerns of a new Rohingya exodus into Bangladesh.\n\nDhaka, Bangladesh – Mohammad Yunus, a 45-year-old resident of Ghumdhum in Bangladesh’s hilly district of Bandarban along the Myanmar border says he has not been able to sleep properly for weeks.\n\nThe reason? Weeks of relentless cross-border gunfire and shelling by the Myanmar military, which experts say could be a way to push more Rohingya into Bangladesh.\n\n“We are not able to sleep at night. There are constant sounds of firing guns. Sometimes there are explosions,” Yunus told Al Jazeera over the telephone.\n\n“We have left our house and moved to a relative’s place. We are scared for our lives,” he said.\n\nThe firing from Myanmar has escalated tensions between the neighbours, raising concerns of a new Rohingya exodus into Bangladesh as well as diminishing prospects of their repatriation into Myanmar.\n\nThe Bandarban administration said it has started the process of relocating some 300 families living in Ghumdhum to a safer place further inland. The no-man’s land in the frontier area is also home to about 4,500 Rohingya refugees.\n\nLast Friday, a Rohingya teenager was killed and four other Bangladeshi nationals injured when mortar shells fired from Myanmar exploded on a strip of land along the Bangladesh-Myanmar border.\n\nBangladesh has the world’s largest refugee camp with nearly a million mainly Muslim Rohingya, most of whom fled a brutal crackdown by the Myanmar military in 2017, which the United Nations said was carried out with “genocidal intent”.\n\nMyanmar has been charged with genocide at the International Court of Justice in The Hague. Myanmar’s military denies the charges.\n\nBangladesh is lobbying with international agencies to repatriate the Rohingya back to their homeland, but the refugees have refused, citing safety concerns, and continue to stay in squalid and cramped camps.\n\nNow, weeks of relentless gunfire and shelling by the Myanmar military along its border with Bangladesh have added to the tensions between the neighbours.\n\nLocal media reports earlier this month said more than a dozen Rohingya have entered Bangladesh amid the cross-border firing, seeking refuge in camps near Teknaf. Hundreds more Rohingya have gathered near the border in a bid to cross the Naf River into Bangladesh, the reports added.\n\nBangladesh foreign minister A K Abdul Momen this week said the government has sealed its border with Myanmar to prevent a further influx of Rohingya refugees into Bangladesh.\n\n“We won’t take any more Rohingya people,” Momen told a press briefing on Wednesday.\n\nWhile Bangladesh’s border protection force, the Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB), has stepped up vigilance along the 271-kilometre (168-mile) Bangladesh-Myanmar border, Dhaka said it does not want to engage militarily and is seeking to resolve the tension through diplomatic channels.\n\nAung Kyaw Moe, Myanmar’s envoy in Dhaka, has been summoned four times in as many weeks by the Bangladesh foreign ministry, which has raised serious concerns over mortar shells falling on its territory, indiscriminate aerial firing and airspace violations.\n\nMoe said the firings into Bangladeshi territory were conducted by the Arakan Army, an armed group fighting the Myanmar military for the rights of the ethnic minorities in Myanmar’s Rakhine and Chin states.\n\nSince early August, fighting between the Myanmar military and the Arakan Army has increased along the border.\n\nA top official at the Bangladesh foreign ministry told Moe the shells falling into Bangladesh were unacceptable. He said the dispute between Arakan Army and Myanmar military was their “internal affair” and how they chose to solve it was “completely up to them”.\n\nDelwar Hossain, professor of international relations at Dhaka University, believes Myanmar military firing across the border and airspace violations by Myanmar could be ways to provoke Bangladesh to engage militarily.\n\n“It will sort of divert the international attention from their internal conflicts with different ethnic minority groups that have been going on for long,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nHe said Bangladesh was on the right track so far by not falling into Myanmar’s trap.\n\nHossain said Myanmar could be trying to force another Rohingya influx into Bangladesh’s territory.\n\n“Myanmar also aims to make things more difficult so that the Rohingyas’ repatriation can be put off even longer. They see advantages if they can cause strife or military action in Bangladesh,” he said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Bangladesh’s home minister Asaduzzaman Khan held a meeting with the country’s security and law enforcement agencies. He later said the Bangladesh army was ready to defend the country if instructed to do so.\n\nAlso on the same day, Bangladesh army chief General S M Shafiuddin Ahmed said his troops were prepared to respond against Myanmar if necessary.\n\nForeign minister Momen, however, again stressed on Wednesday that Bangladesh had no intention of going to war with its neighbour and hoped the situation could be resolved diplomatically.\n\nBangladesh’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who is currently in the United States to attend the United Nations General Assembly, is expected to raise the issue in a speech scheduled later on Friday.\n\nHasina is also expected to urge global leaders to play an active role in arranging the repatriation of Rohingya refugees.\n\nShafqat Munir, senior research fellow at the think-tank, Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies, told Al Jazeera the Bangladesh government has taken “absolutely the right steps in taking the diplomatic approach”.\n\n“Our goal should be to solve the problem diplomatically and through dialogue. Military solution is not required at this point,” he said.\n\n“We, however, must be on guard against any prospect of fresh influx of Rohingya or any other displaced Myanmar nationals. We also need to make sure that our voices are heard in the international community.”",
    "Afif Hossain's 77* saves Bangladesh's blushes": "Bangladesh 158 for 5 (Afif 77*, Nurul 35*, Meiyappan 2-33) beat United Arab Emirates 151 (Suri 39, Afzal 25, Miraz 3-17, Shoriful 3-21) by seven runs\n\nAfif Hossain and Mehidy Hasan Miraz led Bangladesh out of trouble an occasion each as they beat UAE by seven runs in the first T20I in Dubai. In front of a sparse crowd mostly made up of expat Bangladeshis, the visitors picked up their first T20I win in the country.\n\nAfter being put in, Bangladesh recovered from 47 for 4, then withstood Chirag Suri 's fiery start with the bat, before 16-year-old debutant Aayan Khan gave them a final scare in the last three overs of the 159-run chase.\n\nAfif top-scored with an unbeaten 77 while Miraz took three wickets and two superb catches, one of his own bowling, before Shoriful Islam's two wickets in the last over sealed the game for Bangladesh.\n\nOpening woes continue for Bangladesh\n\nSabbir Rahman and Miraz walking out to open the innings for Bangladesh laid to rest all the speculation about the opening pair since their curtailed training camp in Dhaka a couple of weeks ago.\n\nTheir stand, however, lasted just nine balls when Sabbir struck Sabir Ali down to Basil Hameed at deep square leg. Miraz also didn't look too comfortable, falling for 12 off 14 balls with two fours, top-edging one back to the fast bowler Zawar Farid in the fifth over.\n\nIn between, the returning Litton Das also fell for 13, although he did start with a lot of intent, hitting three boundaries.\n\nMeiyappan's double-strike\n\nBangladesh got into further trouble when legspinner Karthik Meiyappan removed Yasir Ali with his first ball. The delivery held its line, sending the visitors into a tail-spin at 47 for 4 in the eighth over. Meiyappan has been a revelation since his debut last year, having now taken 16 wickets in ten T20Is. When he lured Mosaddek Hossain out of the crease, and had him stumped for three, it looked like UAE were on the ascendancy.\n\nAfif to the rescue, again\n\nAfif, though, stood firm amid a flurry of wickets. He has already been Bangladesh's leading run-scorer in T20Is this year, so there was a bit of consistency expected of him. He dominated the 30-run stand for the fifth wicket with Mosaddek, before adding 81 in an unbroken stand with captain Nurul Hasan.\n\nLuck was also on Afif's side. He was dropped at deep square leg twice, on 2 and 63. But he struck the ball well through the leg side, regularly hitting it behind square, which seems to be one of his favoured areas this year. He missed a few scoops and ramps, and the straighter bat shots yielded more runs. He finished with three sixes and seven fours - Bangladesh will be happy that they have at one batter who is showing good form.\n\nSuri lights up UAE's chase\n\nSuri started with a boundary spree but Bangladesh had a lucky break in the middle. In the fifth over, a shot from Suri brushed bowler Shoriful's fingers on its way to the stumps at the non-striker's end to find Muhammad Waseem out of his crease. Waseem had struck a four and a six in his run-a-ball 15, but the home side needed a harder push.\n\nSuri then struck the ball brilliantly against Mustafizur Rahman in the last over of the powerplay. He timed the ball behind square on the off side for two fours before adding a third with a swivelled pull when Mustafizur came around the wicket. The 14-run over took UAE to 43 for 1 after six overs.\n\nMiraz comes to the party\n\nThe chasing, however, fell flat when Miraz got into the act. He had Suri stumped in the eighth over for 39 off 24 balls. In his next over, he had the dangerous Aryan Lakra for 19.\n\nAfter that, it was the turn of Miraz the fielder. UAE captain CP Rizwan tried to crack Mustafizur through point, but Miraz dived to his left to complete an excellent catch. Shoriful then removed Basil Hameed, before Miraz took his second brilliant catch of the game. Off his own bowling, he dived full length, once again to his left, to intercept Vriitya Aravind's leading edge.",
    "Inflation, Unrest Challenge Bangladesh's 'Miracle Economy'": "Standing in line to try to buy food, Rekha Begum is distraught. Like many others in Bangladesh, she is struggling to find affordable daily essentials like rice, lentils and onions.\n\n\"I went to two other places, but they told me they don't have supplies. Then I came here and stood at the end of the queue,\" said Begum, 60, as she waited for nearly two hours to buy what she needed from a truck selling food at subsidized prices in the capital, Dhaka.\n\nBangladesh's economic miracle is under severe strain as fuel price hikes amplify public frustrations over rising costs for food and other necessities. Fierce opposition criticism and small street protests have erupted in recent weeks, adding to pressures on the government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which has sought help from the International Monetary Fund to safeguard the country's finances.\n\nExperts say Bangladesh's predicament is nowhere nearly as severe as Sri Lanka's, where months' long unrest led its long-time president to flee the country and people are enduring outright shortages of food, fuel and medicines, spending days in queues for essentials. But it faces similar troubles: excessive spending on ambitious development projects, public anger over corruption and cronyism and a weakening trade balance.\n\nSuch trends are undermining Bangladesh's impressive progress, fueled largely by its success as a garment manufacturing hub, toward becoming a more affluent, middle-income country.\n\nThe government raised fuel prices by more than 50% last month to counter soaring costs due to high oil prices, triggering protests over the rising cost of living. That led authorities to order the subsidized sales of rice and other staples by government-appointed dealers.\n\nThe latest phase of the program, which began Sept. 1, should help about 50 million people, said Commerce Minister Tipu Munshi.\n\n\"The government has taken a number of measures to reduce pressures on low-income earners. That is impacting the market and keeping prices of daily commodities competitive,\" he said.\n\nThe policies are a stopgap for bigger global and domestic challenges.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has pushed higher prices of many commodities at a time when they already were surging as demand recovered with a waning of the coronavirus pandemic. In the meantime, countries like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Laos — among many — have seen their currencies weaken against the dollar, adding to the costs for dollar-denominated imports of oil and other goods.\n\nTo ease the strain on public finances and foreign reserves, the authorities put a moratorium on big, new projects, cut office hours to save energy and imposed limits on imports of luxury goods and non-essential items, such as sedans and SUVs.\n\n\"The Bangladesh economy is facing strong headwinds and turbulence,\" said Ahmad Ahsan, an economist and director of the Dhaka-based Policy Research Institute, a think tank. \"Suddenly we are back to the era of rolling power cuts, with the taka and the forex reserves under pressure,\" he said.\n\nMillions of low-income Bangladeshis, like Begum, whose family of five can barely afford to eat fish or meat even once a month, still struggle to put food on the table.\n\nBangladesh has made huge strides in the past two decades in growing its economy and fighting poverty. Investments in garment manufacturing have provided jobs for tens of millions of workers, mostly women. Exports of apparel and related products account for more than 80% of its exports.\n\nBut with fuel costs so high, authorities shut diesel-run power plants that produced at least 6% of total production, cutting daily power generation by 1,500 megawatts and disrupting manufacturing.\n\nImports in the last fiscal year, ending in June, 2022, rose to $84 billion, while exports have fluctuated, leaving a record current account deficit of $17 billion.\n\nMore challenges are ahead.\n\nDeadlines are fast approaching for repaying foreign loans related to at least 20 mega infrastructure projects, including the $3.6 billion River Padma bridge built by China and a nuclear power plant mostly funded by Russia. Experts say Bangladesh needs to prepare for when repayment schedules ramp up between 2024 and 2026.\n\nIn July, in a move economists view as a precautionary measure, Bangladesh sought a $4.5 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund, becoming the third country in South Asia to recently seek its help after Sri Lanka and Pakistan.\n\nFinance Minister A.H.M. Mustafa Kamal said that the government asked the IMF to begin formal negotiations on loans \"for balance of payments and budgetary assistance.\" The IMF said it was working with Bangladesh to draw up a plan.\n\nBangladesh's foreign reserves have been falling, potentially undermining its ability to meet its loan obligations. By Wednesday they had dropped to $36.9 billion from $45.5 billion a year earlier, according to the central bank.\n\nUsable foreign reserves would be about $30 billion, said Zahid Hussain, a former chief economist of the World Bank's Dhaka office.\n\n\"I would not say this is a crisis situation. This is still enough to meet three months of imports, three and half months of imports. But it also means that … you do not have a lot of room for maneuvering on the reserve front,\" he said.\n\nStill, despite what some economists say is excessive spending on some costly projects, Bangladesh is better equipped to weather hard times than some other countries in the region.\n\nIts farm sector — tea, rice and jute are major exports — is an effective \"shock absorber,\" and its economy, four to five times larger than Sri Lanka's, is less vulnerable to outside calamities like a downturn in tourism.\n\nThe economy is forecast to grow at a 6.6% pace this fiscal year, according to the Asia Development Bank's latest forecast, and the country's total debt is still relatively small.\n\n\"I think in the current context, the most important difference between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh is the debt burden, particularly the external debt,\" said Hussain.\n\nBangladesh's external debt is under 20% of its gross domestic product, while Sri Lanka's was around 126% in the first quarter of 2022.\n\n\"So, we have some space. I mean debt as a source of stress on the macroeconomy is not much of a much problem yet,\" he said.\n\nWaiting in a line to buy subsidized food, 48-year-old Mohammed Jamal said he was not feeling such leeway for his own family.\n\n\"It has become unbearable trying to maintain our standard of living,\" Jamal said. \"Prices are just out of reach for the common people,\" he said. \"It's tough living this way.\"",

    "Bangladesh’s RMG industry preparing for next phase of growth": "Bangladesh's RMG industry preparing for next phase of growth\n\nThe RMG industry of Bangladesh has “immense potential for growth”, Shahidullah Azim, vice president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers Exporters Association (BGMEA) has said, playing a crucial role in propelling the economic development of the country.\n\nSpeaking at an event in Dhaka last week, organised by the National Security Intelligence Training Institute (NSITI), Azim said, as a mainstay of Bangladesh’s economic success story, the apparel sector has continued its endeavours to seize every opportunity that lies ahead and contributes to the development of the country.\n\n“The industry is increasingly focusing on product diversification, innovation, technology upgradation and skill development in a bid to enhance its capabilities and competitiveness in the global market in the coming days,” he added.\n\nThe BGMEA recently urged investment in the country’s readymade garment sector as it gears up for graduation from its status as a least developed country (LDC). The country is expected to graduate from LDC status in 2024, however, it will continue to benefit from duty-free access to the European Union, Canada, and Japan until 2027.\n\nThe country’s growth in recent years has resulted in a decline in poverty levels, stable inflation, moderate public debt, and greater resilience to external shocks.\n\nIn his keynote speech last week, Azim gave an overview of Bangladesh’s RMG industry, including its challenges, opportunities, and preparedness to realise its potential. He also briefed the audience about the RMG industry’s future priorities, including upgrading business capabilities and embracing innovation to address future challenges of the RMG industry, especially after LDC graduation.\n\nThe industry is focusing on diversifying products, especially man-made fibre-based products as part of its strategy of shifting from volume to value and quantity to quality, he said.\n\n“Globally the share of cotton textile and clothing consumption is 25% only, whereas 75% of Bangladesh’s RMG product is concentrated on cotton. This means we have tremendous opportunities in this segment,” he remarked.\n\nHe also briefed the participants about the strategic vision of the BGMEA that aims to accelerate the growth of the RMG industry in a sustainable manner.\n\nLast month, the BGMEA announced a new sourcing event aimed at showcasing sustainability strides being made by Bangladesh garment makers and comprises 17 physical events including conferences, expositions, fashion runway shows, sustainable design and innovation awards, and factory tours.",

    "Bangladesh eye win against Nepal": "Bangladesh national football team players attend a training session at the Army sports ground in Kathmandu on Monday.— BFF photo\n\nAfter a 1-0 win over Cambodia on Thursday, the Bangladesh national football team will be looking to secure their second consecutive win on the international stage when they take on hosts Nepal in another FIFA friendly match in Kathmandu today.\n\nThe match will begin at 5:45pm Bangladesh Standard Time at the Dashrath Stadium, where the Bangladesh women’s team made history a week ago by clinching their maiden SAFF Women’s Championship title with a 3-1 win over Nepal in the final.\n\nSpanish coach Javier Cabrera’s charges reached Nepal from Cambodia on September 23 – a day after they beat hosts Cambodia - and had a three-day long training session in Kathmandu.\n\nThe win against Cambodia was the first win for Bangladesh under the Spaniard’s tutelage since he replaced English coach Jamie Day in January this year.\n\nCabrera believed that the win against Cambodia would inspire his charges to earn another win against Nepal.\n\n‘Obviously, Cambodia’s win is a big boost for the players’ anyway the players are positive, the group is confident, and every day they work hard enough to win tomorrow’s [Tuesday] game. They will give their best to win, ‘Cabrera said in the pre-match press conference on Monday.\n\nBangladesh captain Jamal Bhuyian was a bit cautious as Nepal would be playing at their home.\n\n‘It is Nepal’s home ground and we have to respect the home team…We want to be competitive tomorrow to win the match,’ said Jamal.\n\nNepal team’s interim coach, Pradip Humagain, vowed to present the country with a win as they will be celebrating the Durga Puja, beginning on October 1.\n\n‘It’s a great opportunity for us on the occasion of our great festival to play with our neighboring country, Bangladesh, in our homeland.

And as always, it is going to be exciting before the home crowds.’\n\nAlongside the home venue advantages, the latest FIFA rankings show that the Nepalese are stronger than Bangladesh, who are 16 steps behind Nepal (176th).\n\nThe most recent game results statistics also favoured Nepal, as Bangladesh could only manage a 2-0 win against Nepal in a friendly game in November 2020, while losing twice and drawing twice since September 2018.\n\nHowever, the overall statistics tell a different story, with Bangladesh winning 13 times, drawing three times, and losing seven times in their previous 20 meetings since September 1983.",

    "Liberal trade could boost Bangladesh’s GDP by 14.8%: World Bank study": "Infographic: TBS\n\nUnilateral trade and investment liberalisation could boost Bangladesh's GDP, investment, and exports by 14.8%, 20%, and 63.2%, respectively, according to a World Bank study.\n\nSuch unilateral reforms will help Bangladesh reduce trade costs and access to cheaper and better-quality imported inputs to boost domestic firms' competitiveness and output, it says, pointing out that Bangladesh's trade competitiveness is eroding mainly due to lack of lower export base.\n\nFor greater market access for exports, Bangladesh needs to explore deeper and comprehensive trade integration within the region and beyond, suggests the report \"Bangladesh- Country Economic Memorandum: Change of fabric,\" which was disclosed on the bank's website on Friday.\n\nIts chapter 3 on \"Boosting Bangladesh's Trade Competitiveness\" studies the potential gains for Bangladesh from regional and multinational integration as well as trade reforms.\n\nThe report, while calling for deeper bilateral integration with India and the European Union, estimates that the impact of a preferential trade agreement with India will be higher, with export gains more than double the benefits of an agreement with the European Union.\n\nBangladesh could also reap significant benefits from participating in regional integration with South Asian and Southeast Asian countries, with an estimated increase in GDP between 1.4% and 14.3%, it estimates.\n\nBangladesh's trade intensity is lower than predicted for countries at similar levels of per capita income and the country is missing out on gains from trade due to an inward-looking trade regime, it points out.\n\nWhile tariff modernisation is an important step to support export diversification, an ambitious trade agenda that covers goods, services, and investment can boost the gains for Bangladesh.\n\nBangladesh's gains from a deep regional integration scenario are estimated to be more than 10 times higher compared with shallow regional integration relying on tariff cuts only, the study estimates in its designated chapter.\n\nGiven historical political tensions, the degree of regional integration in South Asia is very low compared with other world regions, it points out. Despite growth over the past 20 years, trade and investment linkages between Bangladesh and South Asia are still constrained by high tariffs and NTBs, and burdensome and costly customs procedures, it says, suggesting that Bangladesh can focus on strategies that go beyond South Asia and include countries in Southeast Asia and beyond as well as pursue free trade agreements.\n\n\"Bangladeshi policy makers may consider joining existing regional groupings such as ASEAN or the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership,\" reads the report.\n\nCommenting on the study, Dr Zahid Hossain, former chief economist of the World Bank in Dhaka, said Bangladesh can benefit from regional connectivity and signing FTAs with South Asia and South-East Asian countries. But in that case, along with achieving progress in ease of doing business, initiatives should be taken to remove existing tariff and non-tariff barriers in various markets.\n\nWhile speaking high of regional and multinational integration, the World Bank study also points to the possible downsides in some areas.\n\n\"Bangladesh has a lot to lose from missing out on intraregional Southeast Asia integration, with GDP gains cut to about a third and export gains at less than a fifth compared with the open regionalism scenario,\" it assesses.\n\nRemoval of tariff wall needed for an export boost\n\nThe lack of export diversification may be at least partly attributed to the country's protective trade regime.\n\nThe high level of protection, provided through high tariffs and complex and nontransparent para-tariffs, such as regulatory and supplementary duties, is a key reason for the static export basket, it identifies.\n\nBangladesh's average tariffs doubled from 14.7% without para-tariffs to 28.8% with para-tariffs in FY2021, incentivising industries to focus on the domestic market rather than exports, thus creating creating an anti-export bias, the study points out, suggesting that reduction in protective tariff rate by 3-5% every year in line with the Eighth Five Year Plan.\n\nAverage tariffs in Bangladesh are higher than its competitors. Average tariff rate on intermediate goods in Bangladesh is 18.8%, which is more than double the rate in China (7.4%) and almost double the rate in Thailand and Vietnam (9.6%) but closer to the rate in India (14.7%).\n\nModernisation of tariff regime by moving toward low and uniform tariffs and adopting a single rate for similar goods, irrespective of origin, gradual elimination of para-tariffs and making the tariff structure consistent with that of an upper-middle-income country can end the \"anti-export\" bias and help diversify exports, the report suggests.\n\nBenefit from US-China tariff war\n\nBangladesh could also benefit in the short term from trade diversion if the United States and China were to engage in sustained trade tensions and keep retaliatory tariffs in place.\n\n\"Even in the absence of any additional reform measures, GDP in Bangladesh is estimated to increase by 0.4 percent,\" says the report.\n\nAssuming that Bangladesh can capitalise on the opportunities provided by US-China trade diversion and expand exports to respond to these new sources of demand in the United States and China, exports could expand by 0.7%, it estimates.\n\nDr MA Razzaque, research director of Policy Research Institute, told The Business Standard that Bangladesh has already begun to enjoy some of the benefits of the US-China tariff conflict. The high growth in Bangladesh's garment exports to the US market over the past few months has been made possible due to the US-China conflict.\n\nHe said that China's share of the US RMG market is still about 25% which will decrease further in the coming days.\n\n\"For Bangladesh to export a portion of that, emphasis should be placed on man-made fibre, because a major part of China's RMG export is man-made fibre,\" he said.\n\nMA Razzaque said, due to the dollar crisis, the exchange rate has been left to the market, so there has been a major reform in terms of export competition.\n\n\"The export sector is getting its benefits. However, Bangladesh's export capacity will not increase unless customs, ports, trade facilities, cargo handling and internal transport systems are modernised. The bottom line is both business costs and time need to be reduced,\" he said.",
    "UNHCR Bangladesh Operational Update, August 2022 - Bangladesh": "This month marked five years since more than 700,000 Rohingya women, men and children fled Myanmar for Bangladesh, joining hundreds of thousands who had sought and found refuge in the country in previous years. UNHCR has appealed for renewed support and solutions for the refugees. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy on Myanmar visited the refugee camps in Bangladesh, advocating for more education and livelihood opportunities for the refugees to prepare for their sustainable reintegration in Myanmar. A demonstration by the refugees calling for a safe and dignified return to Myanmar took place on 25 August.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS OF THE MONTH\n\nThis month 486 refugee adolescent girls and 389 refugee caregivers graduated from the first cycle of the 2022 Girl Shine Program. A total of 1,241 adolescent girls and 1076 caregivers are participating in the program this year, which gives refugee girls the skills, knowledge, social networks and self-confidence to help protect themselves from gender-based violence as they navigate through adolescence and beyond.\n\nThe COVID-19 booster vaccination dose (Pfizer) for refugees over 18 years of age began on 27 August 2022 and will run untill 15 September 2022 in the Cox’s Bazar camps. So far 95,706 individuals have received the booster dose. Overall, a total of 527,711 individuals 12 years and above have received one dose reaching 94 per cent coverage.\n\nUNHCR has set up a research project to establish the best way to reuse the by-products generated from the faecal sludge treatment plant for agriculture. Different kinds of crops along with bamboo have been planted in the research unit and the Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh is providing expert support. The faecal sludge treatment plant is one of the largest in a humanitarian setting, servicing 120,000 refugees.\n\nThe dengue prevention campaign continued mass cleaning, fumigation, and awareness raising continued in the refugee camps. Overall, 87,400 refugees were reached with dengue prevention messages. 411 refugee volunteers supported the cleaning of drainage, extending for almost 500,000 feet. 52 marketplaces were cleaned and disinfected with the support of the community.\n\nThis month 150,080 refugees were reached by Community Outreach Members, imams and female religious leaders who provided information on health, monsoon and cyclone preparedness, fire safety, and protection issues such as child protection, gender-based violence, trafficking, and social cohesion. The campaign included house to house visits, through which more than 3,600 persons with specific needs were identified and referred to services in the camps.\n\nAs part of ongoing capacity building of Armed Police Battalion (APBn) in the camps, 192 APBn personnel, including 30 women were trained on refugee protection, including community policing, safe identification, confidential referrals, and gender and child-sensitive policing. APBn is responsible for safety and security in the camps.\n\nWith the support of the PSEA Network, UNHCR organized a one-day workshop for PSEA focal points of 22 different organizations. The workshop refreshed partners’ knowledge of the referral mechanism and case management for survivors.",
    "Celebrating Bangladesh’s family planning success": "Bangladesh faced enormous challenges in 1971, grappling with poverty, limited resources, poor healthcare access, food insecurity, and a rapidly growing population. At the time, one in five children died before they turned five, more than five in 100 mothers died during pregnancy or childbirth, and women gave birth to an average of seven children.\n\nIn this context, the government of the young country prioritized family planning, a pivotal decision that set the stage for the economic growth and improved health and education outcomes that Bangladesh is known for today.\n\nOn World Contraception Day, September 26, the United States congratulates Bangladesh on developing a successful family planning program that helps families plan the timing and number of children with the help of a range of modern and effective contraceptive options. The US government, through the US Agency for International Development (USAID), is proud to have contributed to this world-renowned success throughout our 50-year partnership.\n\nWhy does family planning matter and how did it help Bangladesh?\n\nAccess to voluntary family planning and reproductive health services provides families with the freedom to choose how many children they want to have, and when to have them. This is a crucial component for promoting safe motherhood and healthy families. Having children spaced too closely together can negatively affect the health of both mothers and children.\n\nWhen parents can focus on long-term goals for their children rather than focusing solely on survival, they invest in education and specialized skills training, save for their futures, and enable children to maximize their potential in life and become productive members of tomorrow’s workforce.\n\nThis benefits families, communities, and entire countries. No country has emerged from poverty in the last 50 years without expanding family planning access. This is why family planning matters.\n\nAs the world’s largest bilateral family planning donor, the US government provided expertise to support Bangladesh’s vision to expand access to high quality family planning methods. Alongside the government of Bangladesh, we worked with non-government organizations, the private sector, and other donors to build knowledge of and demand for family planning, while simultaneously helping the health system to deliver better quality services.\n\nHow did Bangladesh achieve their family planning goals?\n\nFirst, by collecting and using robust evidence. Where the global evidence was scarce, Bangladesh invested in research to build an evidence base. USAID worked with the government of Bangladesh for decades to collect demographic and health data to inform service delivery programs and reach out to people through popular radio and television campaigns.\n\nThese efforts helped elevate family planning from a taboo topic to an essential health service that has saved the lives of millions of mothers and children.\n\nSecond, Bangladesh expanded access to health services and commodities, even in hard-to-reach areas. The country proved to the world that rural women not only benefit, but can effectively deliver health services, including family planning, in their communities.\n\nThis model method became an essential vehicle to deliver health and family planning service delivery around the world.\n\nBangladesh continued to add different methods of family planning to the available services, understanding that men and women have different needs, and not every family planning method is right for everyone.\n\nNow, in addition to health workers providing family planning commodities in rural communities, many family planning methods are widely available in pharmacies, and clinical methods are offered from both public and private sector facilities.\n\nTo ensure a stable, steady supply of contraceptive products, USAID helped Bangladesh build a supply chain management system to effectively deliver family planning commodities when and where they are needed.\n\nBangladesh’s pioneering family planning program advanced global knowledge, and those lessons reduced maternal and child deaths in many other countries around the world. While Bangladesh’s family planning story continues to be written, it is clear that robust family planning programs helped lift an entire country.\n\nBeyond improving the health of women and children, access to contraceptives has given Bangladeshi families the freedom to choose the number of children they want to have and when they want to have them.\n\nThis opened educational and economic opportunities for millions of women. And when incomes and opportunities for women increase, entire communities and countries benefit.\n\nToday, most people say they want two children, which is the average family size in Bangladesh. This is a testament to the hard work and dedication of Bangladesh and those who have supported its vision over the past 50 years.\n\nKathryn D Stevens is Mission Director, United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in Bangladesh, United States Embassy, Dhaka.",
    "Bangladesh authorities arrest siblings of UK-based journalists": "Share this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nTelegram\n\n\n\nNew York, September 20, 2022 – Bangladesh authorities must immediately and unconditionally release Nur Alam Chowdhury Pervez and Abdul Muktadir Manu and cease harassing family members of journalists who report from abroad, the Committee to Protect Journalists said Tuesday.\n\nOn September 13, officers with the detective branch of the Bangladesh police, in the Noakhali town of the southeast Chittagong division, arrested Nur Alam Chowdhury Pervez, brother of Shamsul Alam Liton, editor of the privately owned United Kingdom-based Weekly Surma newspaper, according to news reports, a report by The Weekly Surma, a Twitter thread by Bangladeshi editor Tasneem Khalil, and a person familiar with the case, who spoke to CPJ by phone on the condition of anonymity due to fear of reprisal.\n\nThe September 13 police first information report, a document that opens an investigation, accuses the U.K.-based Liton of spreading anti-government propaganda on social media platforms and alleges that Pervez conspires with Liton to create “confusion and agitation” among the public.\n\nSeparately, on September 9, police in Moulvibazar town in the northeast Sylhet division arrested Abdul Muktadir Manu, brother of Abdur Rab Bhuttow, a special correspondent for The Weekly Surma and head of the privately owned digital news platform London Bangla Channel, according to news reports and a person familiar with the case, who spoke to CPJ by phone on the condition of anonymity due to fear of reprisal.\n\n“The Bangladesh government’s targeting of family members of critical journalists is an egregious form of retaliation that must not go unnoticed by its diplomatic partners and the international community,” said Beh Lih Yi, CPJ’s Asia program coordinator, in Frankfurt, Germany. “Authorities must swiftly and unconditionally release Nur Alam Chowdhury Pervez and Abdul Muktadir Manu and cease subjecting family members of foreign-based journalists to detention, harassment, and other forms of reprisal.”\n\nThe September 10 police first information report alleges that Manu is conspiring with the U.K.-based Bhuttow to remove Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina from power and “destroy the image of the state.”\n\nBoth police reports cited a section of the Bangladesh Code of Criminal Procedure that allows authorities to conduct warrantless arrests if there is “reasonable suspicion” that an individual may commit an offense.\n\nThe arrests came days before the prime minister left on official visits to the U.K. and the United States.\n\nThe person familiar with Pervez’ case told CPJ that he is also the brother of Hasina Akhter, host of the U.K.-based political affairs talk show Table Talk with Hasina Akhter, and Shah Alam Faruq, editor of the U.K.-based, privately owned digital news platform Shoja Kotha. On August 14, Liton published an editorial for The Weekly Surma calling on Hasina to hold government officials accountable for alleged money laundering.\n\nCPJ’s source said they believed Pervez’ arrest was either retaliation for his sibling’s critical journalism or because of Liton’s organization of a protest in front of the British parliament in support of Bangladeshi victims of enforced disappearances on August 30. Pervez is the Noakhali district president of the Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal, a socialist party associated with Hasina’s ruling Awami League party.\n\nSeparately, the person familiar with Manu’s case told CPJ that they believed his arrest was in retaliation for Bhuttow’s critical journalistic work, most notably two interviews he published on the London Bangla Channel in August 2022 with retired lieutenant colonel Hasinur Rahman, who received international attention for his allegation that Bangladesh’s military intelligence secretly detained him on two separate occasions in 2011 and 2018.\n\nThat person told CPJ that Bhuttow received several anonymous threatening calls and messages following the publication of these interviews, warning him to stop his critical journalistic work.\n\nManu is a government servant with a local administrative unit associated with the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, according to news reports and the person familiar with the case, who added that Moulvibazar jail authorities have denied Manu access to his family since his arrest.\n\nThe Bangladesh police, the Awami League, and the prime minister’s office did not respond to CPJ’s emailed requests for comment.\n\nPreviously, Bangladesh authorities detained Nusrat Shahrin Raka, sister of the U.S.-based Bangladeshi journalist Kanak Sarwar, from October 2021 to March 2022, and have repeatedly harassed the mother of Khalil, who is based in Sweden as the editor-in-chief of the Netra News website.",
    "Bangladesh Baseline Study Report for the Integrated Flood Resilience Programme (Phase 2) - Bangladesh": "Executive Summary\n\nThe “Integrated Flood Resilience Programme (IFRP): Phase Two through Community-Based Disaster Risk Reduction (CBDRR)” is one of the comprehensive resilience programmes of BDRCS and IFRC to enhance community resilience through reducing the vulnerability of highly exposed people to floods and to strengthen the community resilience capacity of the disaster vulnerable households through a community led approach. The programme is being implemented at the four communities of Tangail district by BDRCS with the technical support and overall guidance by IFRC. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA), Republic of Korea is providing the fund and the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) is working as the monitoring and liaison partner of this programme. The goal of the programme is to build the resilience of the community to respond to floods and other climate induced phenomena, including COVID-19 pandemic/health emergencies effectively and efficiently.\n\nSurvey Design: The Baseline Survey was a designed activity under the programme. The major objective of the survey was to collect primary and secondary data based on the indicators of the programme from four communities of Tangail district. The Survey was collaboratively conducted by BDRCS and IFRC with the support of Tangail Red Crescent Unit. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used in the research. Household survey with 1,550 samples, 08 FGDs and 10 KIIs were conducted for the baseline survey data collection purpose.\n\nSome Key Findings of this Survey: It was found that the rate of education was low among the community people, 62 per cent of the respondents had no formal or institutional education. The main occupations of the household heads of the four communities were based on the economy considering the rural context. About 42 per cent and 24 per cent of the household head’s main occupations is agriculture and day labouring. The households had an average monthly income of BDT 6,844 and their average monthly expenditure was BDT 7,272. Only 42 per cent of the households had their own agricultural and homestead lands. Followings are sector wise summary of this survey for a quick glance.\n\nFindings on Disaster Preparedness: Only 21per cent of the respondents of the four communities had ideas about climate change and disaster risk reduction and about 29 per cent of the respondents had ideas/knowledge about flood resilience. Flood is the main disaster of the four communities in the last 20 years and about 89 per cent of the respondents also mentioned that river erosion had impacts on their life and livelihoods. About 63 per cent, 55 per cent, 49 per cent and 44 per cent of the respondents mentioned that flood destroys their household and properties, stops daily working opportunity, destroys crops and agricultural lands and makes people shelter less. About 49 per cent, 65 per cent and 70 per cent of the households used to take actions before, during and after the flood period. Only 28 per cent of the respondents had ideas on flood early warning messages and there was no established flood early warning system at the four communities. About 87 per cent of the respondents mentioned that their households’ livelihoods were hampered during the last flood and their households’ heads had very limited options of earnings.\n\nFindings on Livelihoods: Only 1 per cent of the respondents or their household members received skill development training to improve livelihood/income generating options in the last three years. While identifying the necessary training for the community people to improve their livelihoods, the respondents suggested that training on animal-husbandry/poultry rearing, agriculture, tailoring and small business/retailing, small cottage, fisheries, IT and technical and vocational training would be helpful for them. About 92 per cent per cent of the respondent’s houses were found as Kaccha and only 34 per cent per cent of the respondents considered their houses as resilient to any type of disaster and flood risk.\n\nFindings on WASH: It was found that all households of the four communities used tube-well as the major source of drinking water. Around 60 per cent of the tube-wells of the four communities are inundated when flood occurs. About 97 per cent of the households usually collects drinking water and about 24 per cent of the respondents and its household members had proper knowledge about improved water and its sources. About 43 per cent of the households must use water from inundated tube-wells during the flood period. About 81 per cent of the households had their own latrines and only 26 per cent of the latrines of the communities were protected from flood. About 78 per cent of the respondents and their household members use sandals during defecation and about 84 per cent of the respondents and their household members wash hands by using soap/mud after defecation. Only 27 per cent of the respondents had an idea about proper hand washing technique. About 78 per cent of the respondents has an idea about menstrual hygiene management. About 42 per cent of households covers food items properly and in a hygienic way.\n\nFindings on Health: About 71 per cent of the community people takes treatment and medicine from the village doctor and only 11 per cent of the community people had the capacity to take treatment from private clinics. About 19 per cent of the respondents and their household members had suffered from types of diseases like scabies, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and dysentery during the last flood. Only 11 per cent of the households had the capacity to provide health services and advice from private clinics for their pregnant women. About 95 per cent of the respondents had an idea about COVID-19 and about 85 per cent of the respondents mentioned the COVID-19 kept impacts on the livelihoods of their households. About 14 per cent of the respondents mentioned that the women and girls of the community feel insecure during the disaster/flood period and about 15 per cent of the respondents think that sexual and gender-based violence increase during the disaster/flood period. The community people take different measures to protect women and girls from SGVB resulting from disaster/flood. About 34 per cent of the respondents mentioned that the officials/representatives of Government and nongovernment organizations consult with the community people while doing different works.\n\nRecommendations: From the Baseline Survey, some recommendations were identified so that the implementing team can take effective measures for achieving the goals and outcomes under the programme. It has been recommended to increase the knowledge of the community people on climate change adaptation, disaster risk reduction, community resilience, health, WASH, resilient shelter sustainable livelihoods and COVID-19 though different types of activities under the programme. It has been also recommended to form the Community Disaster Management Committee (CDMC), Community Disaster Response team (CDRT) and establish Community-Based Flood Early Warning Systems (C-BFEWS) and Community Gathering Places (CGPs) at the four communities. Training and cash grants on animalhusbandry/poultry rearing, agriculture, tailoring, small business/retailing, small cottage, fisheries, information technology, technical and vocational training should be provided to the selected beneficiaries if any type of livelihood supports are provided to the selected beneficiaries under the programme. The training and orientations under the programme must include disaster aspects so that the beneficiaries can cope with the disaster situation by utilizing their knowledge and resources. Finally,\n\nBDRCS should do advocacy with Tangail District and Sadar Upazila Administration so that the success of the programme can be achieved. As the programme is for only one year and it will be very tough to implement all the activities under the programme by this stipulated time frame as well as achieve community resilience. So, the concerned management and IFRC should consider the extension of the programme to make the four communities resilient to flood and disaster.",

    "Human Development Report 2021-22: Takeaways for Bangladesh": "The world has plunged into a confluence of calamities such as the Covid-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and the cost of living crisis, which are stacking up on the persistent threat of climate disaster. These are adding new layers of uncertainty that are quickly becoming the new normal. Three novel sources of volatile and interacting strands at a global scale are driving uncertainty: dangerous planetary pressures, sweeping societal transformation, and increased polarisation. With almost everyone everywhere feeling distressed, six out of seven individuals in the world feel unsettled and insecure today.\n\nThis was the key message coming out of the Human Development Report 2021-22, \"Uncertain Times, Unsettled Lives: Shaping our Future in a Transforming World,\" which the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) recently launched. The report also presents an index of human development for every country. The Human Development Index (HDI), which measures a country's average achievement along three basic human development dimensions – a long and healthy life, education, and decent living standards – saw nine out of 10 countries worldwide slipping in their performance for the last two years in a row. With human development falling back to 2016 levels, this indicates worrying reversals in progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nHow is Bangladesh faring in these turbulent times? On the one hand, the country saw its HDI scores persistently improve over the past consecutive years, including in 2021. With a current value of 0.661, it ranks at 129 out of 191 countries and places among medium human-development countries. Bangladesh is also one of South Asia's better performers, with its HDI value above the regional value of 0.632. But additional indices in the report that add equity and sustainability perspectives unmask mixed results. Inequality is a major challenge: Bangladesh's HDI value falls to 0.503 when adjusted for inequality, resulting in a loss of 23.9 percent of its original HDI value.\n\nBangladesh fares quite well when accounting for planetary pressures. Findings from the report reaffirm the country as one of the world's lowest carbon emitters and with little material footprint. At COP26 last year, Bangladesh laudably pledged to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 6.73 percent by 2030. The energy sector is set to account for the bulk of the reduction. As one of the world's most climate-vulnerable countries and as a second-time chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF), this step reinforces Bangladesh's commitment to international solidarity and the cause of climate change. Nonetheless, it will require significant investments, especially in the energy and transport sectors, and the country is still far from attaining its national target for transitioning to clean, renewable energy.\n\nOn a more sobering note, gender parity is an area where Bangladesh has significant room for improvement, despite efforts over the years. A closer look into the Gender Development Index – a measure of disparities in the HDI by gender – presents stark findings. While women are likely to live longer than men, they trail behind when it comes to education and income per capita. On average, women receive 6.8 years of schooling compared to eight years for men. Also, gross national income per capita for Bangladeshi women stands at USD 2,811, compared to USD 8,176 for men.\n\nMoreover, Bangladesh ranks 131 on the Gender Inequality Index (GII), a measure of gender inequality along the dimensions of reproductive health, empowerment, and the labour market. Globally, progress along these dimensions of GII has stagnated over the last three years with overlapping crises contributing to setting women back. In Bangladesh, women's participation in the labour market was stagnating even before the pandemic. Social norms are also influencing persisting gender inequalities: 88 percent of women and 91 percent of men worldwide show at least one clear bias against gender equality along political, economic, and educational dimensions, as well as in areas such as intimate partner violence and women's reproductive rights.\n\nFor Bangladesh, progress in its human development performance weighs heavily for Covid recovery and for realising ambitious goals. It is set to graduate out of the Least Developed Country (LDC) status by 2026. The country has also expressed strong commitments to achieve the SDGs, become an upper-middle-income country by 2031 and a developed nation by 2041. In this context, how can UNDP in Bangladesh continue to support development initiatives to maintain and advance hard-won development gains, while exploring sustainable pathways from crises and vulnerability during uncertain times?\n\nThe future does not have to be bleak. Rather, in line with the recommendations of the report, UNDP has been working to promote policies and programmes around the three \"I\"s – investment, insurance, and innovation – to support the country to thrive in a world in flux. For example, with climate change presenting an existential threat to Bangladesh, we are supporting rural communities in climate-vulnerable areas to adapt to the impacts of climate change. and through an ongoing urban poverty programme across 19 cities and municipalities nationwide, efforts are undertaken to address the interrelated challenges around climate change, migration, and urbanisation, and ensure sustainable and inclusive development.\n\nWe are also supporting Bangladesh's ongoing national social security strategy reform agenda as it gradually adopts a lifecycle-based approach. The pandemic has already highlighted fractures in the current system, and has underscored the need for shock-responsive, urban social protection that includes developing national social insurance schemes. Much more remains to be done in expanding care systems. A gender-responsive social protection system will also be vital to promote gender equality by providing a lifeline to women to improve their income security and help narrow gender gaps in poverty rates.\n\nThere is no scope to be complacent as we strive to support Bangladesh in its efforts to double down on human development. Given the complex challenges confronting Bangladesh and humanity all over the globe, upholding human development through uncertain times will require new ways of engaging and working, connecting partners from across multiple sectors, reflecting the specificities of national and subnational contexts, and finding bridges between short and long-term imperatives. In the words of many of those attending this year's HDR launching, \"The best world is ahead of us if we make the right choices.\" The same applies to Bangladesh.\n\nStefan Liller is the resident representative of UNDP Bangladesh.",
    "India, Bangladesh Ink Pact on Sharing Waters of a Common River": "India and Bangladesh reached an agreement on sharing the waters of a common river and pledged to boost trade links as they reaffirmed close ties Tuesday during a visit to India by Bangladesh’s prime minister, Sheikh Hasina.\n\nCalling Dhaka “our biggest development and trade partner in the region,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said both sides will start talks on a comprehensive economic agreement and expand cooperation in sectors such as information technology, space and nuclear energy.\n\nBuilding close ties with Bangladesh is a priority for India, which is trying to fend off inroads made by China in neighboring South Asian countries like Nepal and Sri Lanka, with Beijing’s Belt and Road infrastructure initiative.\n\nIn Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina’s four-day visit to India is seen as politically significant because it takes place ahead of general elections next year.\n\nAmong the seven pacts signed Tuesday, the one that will be welcomed the most in Dhaka is an agreement to share waters of the Kushiyara River. It is the first such deal the two countries have inked in more than 25 years and is seen as a breakthrough in addressing an issue that has cast a shadow on their otherwise close ties.\n\nA pact to share water resources from transboundary rivers that run downstream from the Himalayas from India into Bangladesh has long been a priority for Bangladesh, a lower riparian state that suffers from crippling water shortages. The rivers sustain South Asia’s agriculture and meet the needs of very large cities in a region that is becoming increasingly water-stressed.\n\nBut an agreement that Bangladesh has sought for sharing waters on one of the major transboundary rivers, the Teesta, has eluded the two countries for more than a decade, largely due to opposition from the West Bengal government in India, through which the river runs.\n\n“India and Bangladesh have resolved many outstanding issues and we hope that all outstanding issues, including Teesta water-sharing treaty, would be concluded at an early date,” Sheikh Hasina said.\n\nTuesday's pact to share waters of the Kushiyara is expected to help alleviate some of Dhaka’s concerns.\n\nNew Delhi and Dhaka have shared close ties since Sheikh Hasina took power in 2009. Calling India Bangladesh’s most important neighbor, she said that “Bangladesh-India bilateral relations are known to be a role model for neighborhood diplomacy.”\n\nBoth countries said they will aim to grow bilateral trade, which doubled in the last five years to reach $18 billion last year. They also announced the completion of the first phase of a thermal power project that Prime Minister Modi said would increase the availability of “affordable electricity” in Bangladesh.\n\nIndia and Bangladesh are also looking to expand connectivity projects – both countries are working on a raft of road, rail and waterway projects.\n\nThe bid to increase links comes as some countries become increasingly wary of Chinese investments after another South Asian country, Sri Lanka, spiraled into an economic crisis as Chinese investments there failed to generate the expected returns and added to a debt burden that has been partly blamed for its meltdown.\n\nBangladesh has one of the world’s fastest growing economies. It has boomed on the back of a growing garment export industry. Bangladesh, however, is among South Asian countries seeking a loan from the International Monetary Fund as it grapples with depleting foreign exchange reserves.\n\nBefore coming for the visit, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina told Indian news agency ANI that her country’s economy remains strong despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and higher oil and food prices in the aftermath of Russia’s war in Ukraine.",
    "Bangladesh to celebrate Eid-e-Miladunnabi October 9": "The Eid-e-Miladunnabi (SM), marking the anniversary of the birth and demise of Prophet Hazrat Muhammad (SM), will be observed in Bangladesh on October 9 with due religious solemnity.\n\nThe decision was taken at the National Moon Sighting Committee's meeting held at the Islamic Foundation's Baitul Mukarram office tonight with Religious Affairs Additional Secretary Md Munim Hasan in the chair.\n\nThe meeting informed that the moon of Rabiul Awal of 1444 Hijri was not sighted in Bangladesh sky on Monday and, due to that reason, the holy month of Rabiul Awal will be counted from September 28 (Wednesday).\n\nOn this day in 570, the 12th of Rabiul Awal of the Hijri calendar, Prophet Muhammad (SM) was born in Makkah of Saudi Arabia with divine blessings and messages of peace for mankind. He also passed away on the same day.\n\nThe day is a public holiday.",
    "Bangladesh's first e-bus service for students to launch in December": "The country's first environment-friendly e-bus (electric bus) service for school-goers is likely to hit Dhaka streets this December.\n\nThe Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) authorities are working to import the air-conditioned e-buses, which will operate in the Gulshan, Banani, and Baridhara areas of the city, officials said.\n\nInitially, students of four English medium schools -- Chittagong Grammar School-Dhaka, Scholastica School, Sir John Wilson School, and Bangladesh International Tutorial School – will be able to avail the service during the pilot project.\n\nAccording to the plan, all schools in Dhaka will gradually be brought under the project if it proves to be a success. Experts say a school bus service is an effective way to reduce traffic jams.\n\nThe DNCC has already completed preliminary work on implementing the initiative. At present, a technical committee is conducting a study that will end in mid-October. The committee will finalize the specifications of the buses, as well as fix fares and catchment areas.\n\n“The city corporation is closely working with the Power Division for setting up charging stations for the buses. The new e-buses will be air-conditioned and dedicated for use as a school bus service,” Md Selim Reza, chief executive officer of the DNCC, told Dhaka Tribune.\n\nTo ensure security, he said, the authorities will use modern technology, including CCTV cameras and tracking systems.\n\nThe DNCC initiated the project to reduce carbon emissions to a large extent and help reduce pollution in Dhaka -- one of the most polluted cities in the world.\n\nEarlier, the state-owned Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation (BRTC) introduced a special school bus service in January 2011 with 14 buses between Mirpur and Azimpur. But the service could not be maintained due to an absence of proper management.\n\nThe BRTC introduced the service mainly to reduce traffic jams, while the DNCC is moving ahead with the same objective since the problem has become more severe than before.\n\nExperts say many cities around the world have school bus services since they are safe and financially convenient.\n\n“The BRTC failed to maintain the catchment area for picking up students while guardians prefer door-to-door service,” said Dr Md Hadiuzzaman, a transport expert.\n\n“But the new initiative taken by the DNCC can be a success as it targets specific zones with specific students,” he told Dhaka Tribune.",
    "Where in Bangladesh is the Indian FDI going?": "The venerable Indian think-tank, the Centre for Policy Research (CPR), recently organized a series of podcasts featuring different countries in South Asia.\n\nI was the guest last week in the podcast featuring Bangladesh.\n\nThe host was Sushant Singh, senior fellow at the Centre.\n\nA former deputy editor of the Indian Express, Sushant has also been a visiting lecturer in political science at Yale University.\n\nI went in expecting Sushant to ask me not only about Bangladesh -- its economy, politics and society -- but also about how we, Bangladeshis, view our large neighbour.\n\nI had a feeling that he will also ask about our relations with China; after all, that is a major subject of interest in India. My hunch proved right.\n\nI responded saying that a major driver of our China relationship is economic with a current focus on infrastructure, but, going forward, there was likely to be another important dimension to our economic relations with China.\n\nI expressed the hope that, in the coming years, there will be a quantum jump in FDI from China, and that a large part of this will be FDI that helps diversify our exports.\n\nBut that is China. What about India?\n\nI argued that on both fronts, i.e., infrastructure and export oriented FDI, China can only partially meet our needs.\n\nThere is thus considerable scope for other countries, India included, to step in and help Bangladesh achieve its infrastructural and export diversification objectives.\n\nOur economic relations with China should not be seen by others as a zero-sum game but a positive-sum one.\n\nWhile I understand that the world does not revolve around economics alone, I pointed out that these economic relationships are important for us and that geopolitics should not unduly cloud the discussion on this.\n\nThus, what India should worry about is not our economic relations with China but how Indian FDI can help Bangladesh achieve its economic upgrading and diversification objectives.\n\nCurrent context\n\nThis brings me to the Prime Minister’s recent trip to India where investment must have been one of the important subjects on the agenda.\n\nThe PM's delegation included a large contingent of business leaders and she had meetings with Indian private sector organizations.\n\nIt is likely that there was a call from the Bangladesh side for more Indian FDI.\n\nWe also know that land is being allocated for constructing an economic zone dedicated to Indian investment.\n\nSo, what kind of investment are we likely to get from India?\n\nFDI experts distinguish between three kinds of FDI:\n\na) Natural-resource seeking FDI where the foreign investor is primarily interested in exploring and exploiting natural resources (such as Chevron’s investment in Bangladesh)\n\nb) Market-seeking FDI where the investor is seeking to operate in a country in order to serve the local market (such as the FDI that has come to the power or mobile telecommunication sectors in Bangladesh)\n\nc) Efficiency-seeking FDI where the investor seeks to produce in a country in order to sell abroad (for example, Bangladesh may be viewed as a cost-efficient production base -- hence the term efficiency-seeking; an example is investment in garments.)\n\nOften, the market-seeking foreign investor has a history of selling certain products to a country from a production base in its home country or elsewhere.\n\nIt then decides to manufacture the products in the recipient country itself.\n\nWithin this category of market-seeking FDI, we may make a distinction between investment in tradable and non-tradable goods.\n\nA motorcycle or a TV is an example of a tradable good because such goods can be exported from one country to another.\n\nBy contrast, power generation will be considered largely non-tradable because power is usually sold within the country in which it is generated, although there are some exceptions.\n\nThe same is true for banking.\n\nIn the early years of Bangladesh’s existence as an independent country, much foreign investor interest was confined to exploiting natural resources and in providing traditional services such as banking.\n\nLater, with the domestic economy expanding, FDI inflows were dominated by market-seeking investment in infrastructure, such as power generation and mobile telecommunication.\n\nWhere the FDI goes\n\nAs of March 31, 2022, exactly half of the FDI stock was in gas and petroleum, banking, power, and telecommunications sectors.\n\nThe only other sector with substantial FDI is textiles and apparels, which have received about 18% of all FDI since independence.\n\nGoing forward, a key objective of FDI should be to help diversify our exports in order to reduce our dependence on garments and gradually shift towards more skill-intensive, complex products, a theme on which I had written earlier in this column.\n\nSo far, very little of the FDI inflow has gone into export-oriented industries and much of that too in the traditional sectors such as garments and leather goods.\n\nThus, while the move away from natural-resource seeking FDI to investments in infrastructure is welcome, the strategy going forward should be to attract more FDI inflows towards efficiency-seeking FDI that can help diversify our export basket.\n\nWill Indian FDI help us meet that objective?\n\nI don't have much information on the activities/sectors that Indian investors are showing interest in.\n\nThis is an area where government agencies such as The Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (Bida) and Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority (Beza) should have some information.\n\nHowever, I do have some data on the investment that has already come in.\n\nThis is from the Bangladesh Bank and is available on its website.\n\nThe data shows the stock of FDI as of March 31, 2022, i.e., the cumulative total of all FDI that has come into Bangladesh since independence (minus any disinvestment.)\n\nA sectoral breakdown is provided which allows me to categorize the FDI from various countries into the three categories I mentioned above.\n\nBefore going into the results for Indian FDI, let me mention that the categorization is a little arbitrary since the data is for broad sectors (such as textiles and apparels, oil and gas, telecommunications, etc) and not for specific activities within each sector.\n\nThus, for example, the data for the pharmaceutical or food sector FDI may include some market-seeking FDI and some efficiency-seeking FDI.\n\nI was not able to make that distinction within each sector.\n\nThus, the categorization is not perfect, but I think the big picture is valid.\n\nFor those interested in details, I have categorized FDI in the gas and petroleum sector as natural-resource seeking, those in the textile and apparel, leather and leather products, food, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, and agriculture and fishing, as efficiency-seeking, and the rest as market-seeking.\n\nThe chart below shows the results for India with China, Hong Kong and South Korea as comparators.\n\nI have left out the category \"natural-resource seeking\" because this is either absent or very negligible for these countries.\n\nWhat we see is interesting.\n\nMuch of the Indian FDI that has come in is of the market-seeking type and not efficiency-seeking.\n\nThis is similar to the composition of Chinese FDI but very different from the type of investment that is coming from Hong Kong or South Korea.\n\nA sizable part of FDI coming from these two jurisdictions is efficiency-seeking.\n\nThis is particularly true for Korean FDI.\n\nAs I said, this categorization is not perfect (we need more granular data) and this does not cover future FDI.\n\nWhat I wanted to do is start a conversation that will lead us to an important question: what is the type of FDI that we are getting in the near future and how consistent is it with our needs and development goals?\n\nThe investment decisions of foreign investors -- whether to invest in a country and, if so, in what sectors -- are shaped by their own motivations.\n\nThe role of public policy in the recipient country is to steer FDI towards activities that are desirable from the view of the country.\n\nIn some cases, the two sets of interest may match well without any public policy intervention.\n\nHowever, in most cases, some policy intervention is required to create the match.\n\nBut first, we must have granular data on where the investments are going, or likely to go.\n\nThe government needs to go beyond just talking about investor roadshows, general meetings with investors or about economic zones being developed for investors from specific countries.\n\nWe would like to see some data on the specific type of FDI that is being discussed.\n\nBoth Bida and Beza should come forth with such data.\n\nWe need public discussion on whether the planned FDI is aligned with our needs.\n\nAt the same time, countries seeking to forge closer relations with us, such as India, should be asking how much the FDI coming from their countries is aligned with Bangladesh’s development aspirations.\n\nThe author is an economist, previously with an international development agency",
    "Beijing to ask Myanmar to put an end to Bangladesh border violence": "Beijing to ask Myanmar to put an end to Bangladesh border violence\n\nBeijing will ask Myanmar to stop violation of Bangladesh's territorial sovereignty and speed up the tripartite mechanism for early Rohingya repatriation.\n\nChinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Li Jiming made the assurance during a meeting with acting foreign secretary Admiral (retd) Khurshed Alam at the foreign ministry today (September 26, 2022).\n\nTalking to reporters after the meeting, Jiming said the recent incidents on the border are unfortunate.\n\nHe said they discussed ways for early repatriation of Rohingya refugees, recent incidents along Bangladesh-Myanmar border, and bilateral cooperation in other areas.\n\nEarly last week, foreign ministry organised separate briefings with the Asean diplomats and other foreign diplomats in Dhaka on the Myanmar-border situation and requested them to use their influence to stop Myanmar's repeated violation of border rules.\n\nSince late August, mortar shells landed in Bangladesh territory from Myanmar and helicopters flew over the border area where the Myanmar military and rebel group Arakan Army have been fighting since early August.\n\nNo representative from the Chinese Embassy in Dhaka was present in that meeting on September 20.\n\n\"We had informed the diplomats of the border situation last week. As no one from the Chinese Embassy was there, we informed them about it today,\" Khurshed Alam told reporters at the foreign ministry.\n\nHe said he sought China's renewed initiative to speed up the tripartite mechanism, which involves Bangladesh, Myanmar and China, for early repatriation of the Rohingyas. Not a single one of over a million Rohingyas could be repatriated since the biggest influx in 2017.\n\nHe said Li Jiming assured that China would raise the issue of Myanmar's border rules violation with Naypyidaw.\n\n\"Our goal is to start the Rohingya repatriation as soon as possible. The situation here is not good so the repatriation process needs to begin,\" Khurshed said.\n\nChina has constructed a number of houses in Rakhine State for sheltering the Rohingyas when they return. So, if the Rohingyas go there, Myanmar will ensure their safety and security, he added.\n\nAsked if the repatriation is possible as conflict is ongoing in Myanmar including in Rakhine State, he said, \"Yes, that's right. But there is no war where the Rohingyas will be taken.\"",
    "Bangladesh: Allow UN to Assist ‘Disappearance’ Inquiries": "Click to expand Image Relatives hold portraits of their missing family members during protest rally on behalf of victims of enforced disappearance by security forces, in front of National Press Club in Dhaka, Bangladesh, August 20, 2022. © 2022 Mamunur Rashid/NurPhoto via AP\n\n(New York) – Bangladesh authorities should heed international calls for transparent, independent investigations into enforced disappearances, Human Rights Watch said today on the International Day of the Victims of Enforced Disappearances. On August 14, 2022, Netra news – which is blocked in Bangladesh – published a whistleblower report revealing that Bangladesh officials were allegedly holding and torturing victims of enforced disappearance at a secret detention site called Aynaghar (house of mirrors).\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet, during her three-day visit to Bangladesh in August, called on the government to establish a “specialized mechanism that works closely with victims, families and civil society to investigate allegations of enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings.” She offered her office’s support to create such a mechanism in line with international standards. Bangladesh’s strategic and trade partners have urged the government to step up measures to hold senior members of security forces accountable and prevent future abuses.\n\n“The evidence of Bangladesh authorities’ involvement in countless enforced disappearances is overwhelming,” said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The Bangladesh government should stop feigning ignorance and work with the UN to provide urgent answers and effective accountability.”\n\nIn August 2021, Human Rights Watch published a report on enforced disappearances in Bangladesh alongside a webpage documenting 86 cases of apparently disappeared people. The Bangladesh government’s only response was to deny the allegations. Since then, it has not provided updated information to Human Rights Watch on any of these cases.\n\nOn December 10, 2021, the US government designated Global Magnitsky human rights sanctions against Bangladesh’s Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) and top commanders implicated in abuses, particularly enforced disappearances. In response, Bangladesh authorities initiated a campaign of threats and intimidation against families of victims of enforced disappearances. This was presumably intended to contradict and undermine the families’ allegations, although officials claimed they were only investigating the factual record.\n\nMaayer Daak, an advocacy group of families of victims of enforced disappearance, said that the authorities visited and threatened at least 10 victims’ families, in some cases forcing them to sign false statements that their relative was not forcibly disappeared and that they had intentionally misled the police. Some reporting on these reprisals has since been taken down from the internet, raising concerns of media censorship.\n\nIn February, UN rights experts urged the government to end reprisals and said that the ongoing acts of intimidation and harassment seemed “to indicate a concerted effort to silence families of victims and anyone who has been working to clarify the fate of the numerous individuals who have been forcibly disappeared over the years.”\n\nThe experts said they were concerned about:\n\nthe lack of serious progress in clarifying the fate and whereabouts of disappeared persons in the country.… Instead, the authorities appear to have shielded RAB officials and other security agencies from any scrutiny and from criminal responsibility. In this regard, we are particularly alarmed by the prevailing culture of impunity, which effectively undermines the rights of victims and their families to truth, justice, redress, and guarantees of non-recurrence.\n\nBachelet urged the Bangladesh government to invite the UN Working Group on Enforced Disappearances to visit Bangladesh to “show a commitment to decisively address this issue.” She also said that Bangladesh should ratify the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance.\n\nIn August, Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan denied that there had been any enforced disappearances, repeating previous claims that those missing were in hiding to escape prosecution for criminal actions, to avoid debt repayments, or due to family disagreements. Of the 76 cases included by the Working Group on Enforced Disappearances, the minister said that most had been resolved and that 28 of them had absconded because they faced criminal charges. Families of the disappeared, he declared, had an “ulterior motive” for their protests.\n\nThe Bangladesh government has repeatedly failed to respond meaningfully to concerns raised by the UN, foreign governments, activists, and victims’ families regarding grave allegations of torture, enforced disappearance, and extrajudicial killings in the country, Human Rights Watch said. Other governments should consider joining the US sanctions against security force units and individuals to address the lack of accountability and prevent further abuses. The UN Department of Peace Operations should heed Bachelet’s warning that as “the biggest contributor of uniformed personnel to UN peacekeeping missions, Bangladesh should ensure it has a robust system in place for the careful human rights screening of security personnel.”\n\n“Families of victims of enforced disappearances have spent years being tormented by authorities’ flippant denials about the whereabouts of their loved ones,” Ganguly said. “The Bangladesh government should mark the International Day of the Victims of Enforced Disappearances by taking the first step toward accountability.”",
    "Rupee trade with Bangladesh likely as it fights forex crunch, say bankers": "A dollar crunch in Bangladesh, dip in the country's foreign exchange reserves and a weakening taka may soon pave the way for a rupee loan line to Bangladesh and settlement of India's trade with the neighbour in local currency, according to banking circles.Two senior bankers told ET that in the wake of the turbulence faced by Bangladesh they expect a bilateral loan denominated in Indian rupees can be used by the country to pay for the imports from India.A framework for settling exports and imports invoiced in rupees is in place with the Reserve Bank of India 's June 11 circular allowing special vostro accounts that banks of the partner country can have with banks in India.It may further require a central bank notification allowing settlement of trade transactions in Indian rupees outside the Asian Clearing Union mechanism - an arrangement, in vogue since the mid-70s, to facilitate payments among member countries on a multilateral basis to economise on the use of forex reserves and transfer costs. (In May, RBI permitted settlement of trade with Sri Lanka in rupees as the country grappled with a severe shortage in hard currency).Indian banks have turned cautious and selective on their exposure to Bangladesh amid fears that in the coming days banks there may find it difficult to organise dollars from the market to pay for the goods the country imports.Bangladesh is considering currency diversification and measures to cut down dollar outgo.\"Under the circumstances we understand that a rupee loan facility may be under consideration. It would reduce the strain on Bangladesh's forex kitty and is likely to work out cheaper when the loan is repaid later. If the loan is in rupee, the outgo in taka terms would be less compared to a dollar loan because the rupee would also depreciate,\" said a banker.However, the advantage is retained only if the loan is used only to buy Indian goods invoiced in rupees. If the rupees lent is converted to US dollars and used to buy dollar-invoiced goods, the benefit goes away.But a rupee loan line is a matter that New Delhi and Dhaka, along with the central banks of the two countries have to finalise. \"We have not received any communication from the RBI or the ministry so far. However, we believe some initial discussions have happened given the relationship between the two countries,\" said the person. An RBI spokesman did not comment on the matter.According to the RBI circular, the exchange rate between the currencies of the two trading partner countries (settling trade in rupees) may be market-determined. \"While a rupee-taka exchange rate can be arrived at using the dollar, the banks representing exporters and importers cannot readily sell rupees to buy taka or vice-versa as currencies are partly convertible. Unlike the trade with Russia, exports are more than imports from Bangladesh,\" said an industry official.Bangladesh had a trade deficit of $14 billion with India in the last financial year. The country's forex reserves have fallen below $37 billion - down by over $11 billion in one year.Geopolitics and financial compulsions have combined to push countries to figure out ways to promote foreign trade in domestic currencies. Whhile the India-Russia trade in rupee (yet to fully take off) is an outcome of US sanctions, a local currency trade with Sri Lanka is the fallout of an acute shortage in hard currency. \"While rupee remains a currency of limited convertibility, the new arrangements could slowly increase its acceptance in other markets. Probably, countries would look beyond arrangements like ACU,\" said a banker.",
    "Latest water-sharing deal between Bangladesh, India is ‘drop in the ocean’": "Bangladesh and India share 54 rivers that flow down from the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal, chief among them the Ganges and the Brahmaputra.\n\nManaging the flow of water both upstream and down is crucial for agriculture, navigation, inland fisheries, and keeping saltwater intrusion at bay in Bangladesh, but is undermined by a lack of water-sharing agreements.\n\nThe Bangladeshi and Indian prime ministers recently signed an agreement on sharing water from the Kushiara River for irrigation, but experts say this is nothing special in the grand scheme of things.\n\nThey’ve called on the governments of both countries to push for securing long-term treaties on water sharing from major rivers like the Ganges and the Teesta, which in the latter case has been hobbled by local politics in India.\n\nWater management experts have derided as “a drop in the ocean” an agreement between Bangladesh and India to share water from the Kushiara River, a minor waterway out of the 54 that flow between the two countries.\n\nIn a recent visit to India, Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina signed a memorandum of understanding with her Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, in which both governments agreed to withdraw the equivalent of 4.3 cubic meters (153 cubic feet) per second of water from the Kushiara during the off-monsoon season from November to May.\n\n“Bangladesh will irrigate 5,000 hectares [12,400 acres] of arable land with this water,” said Malik Fida A. Khan, a member of the Joint Rivers Commission (JRC) , a technical body that advises the Bangladesh government on the management of transboundary rivers and water.\n\nTransboundary water experts in Bangladesh, however, say the new agreement is a “drop in the ocean.” They expressed frustration that India, sitting upriver, is unwilling to consider the interests of downstream Bangladesh when it comes to sharing of water from the major rivers flowing from the Himalayas down to the Bay of Bengal.\n\n“I personally do not consider the MOU for Kushiara a special one,” said Ainun Nishat, a former technical member of the JRC and professor emeritus at Bangladesh’s BRAC University.\n\n“Both countries are already withdrawing water from the middle of the river — which is an international border — for irrigation. While formalizing an existing consensus is good, there are several other major issues on transboundary rivers that Bangladesh has raised for a long time, which are not getting priority in India.”\n\nBangladesh is an active delta formed by sediments carried through the rivers flowing from the Himalayas. The two neighboring countries share at least 54 such rivers, according to the JRC, the most prominent among them being the Ganges and the Brahmaputra. Agriculture, navigation, inland fisheries, and keeping saltwater intrusion at bay are all heavily dependent on the flow of water of these rivers.\n\nTreaties for major rivers\n\nTo date, the only ongoing long-term agreement on river management between the countries is the Ganges Water Sharing Treaty of 1996. During PM Hasina’s recent visit to India, both governments agreed to conduct an assessment of the optimum utilization of water received by Bangladesh under the provision of the treaty, which ends in 2025.\n\n“We are looking at this as an ongoing process of getting the treaty prolonged,” said Malik Fida, who also serves as executive director of the Centre for Environmental and Geographic Information Services (CEGIS) and was part of PM Hasina’s entourage during the India visit.\n\n“This assessment should have been done right after the agreement was signed in 1996, as per the treaty,” said Nishat, who played a key role in bringing about the treaty. “But it never took place. It is good to see that it is finally going to happen.”\n\nBangladesh has been seeking a treaty to share the water of the Teesta River, another major common river, for several years.\n\nBut while India’s national government has been keen to arrive at an agreement, there’s been resistance from the state government of West Bengal, through which the Teesta flows before entering Bangladesh.\n\nThe two countries did reach a provisional agreement in 1983 to share the water of the Teesta during the lean pre-monsoon period, under which Bangladesh would get 36% of the water and India 39%, while 25% would remain unallocated. That agreement ended in 1985 and was extended to 1987, but there’s been no progress since then on reviving it.\n\nIn 2011, both the governments were ready to sign an agreement during a visit by then-PM Manmohan Singh of India. But it was canceled at the last minute after the West Bengal chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, pulled out of the visit.\n\nSince then, the issue has been stuck in “discussions.”\n\n“The chances of getting a concrete decision on Teesta water share is very little because of political complexities in India,” Nishat said. “The West Bengal ruling party does not want to lose votes by agreeing to share the water, and at the same time, the ruling party in the Indian central government does not want to antagonize West Bengal voters as they are looking to increase their political stake in the state.”\n\nRole of the JRC\n\nActivists and experts say the Joint Rivers Commission, the body that’s supposed to facilitate discussions on sharing water between the countries, has been ineffective.\n\nThe JRC is meant to arrange a regular meeting at least once a year between officials from the two countries. But the latest JRC meeting, held on Aug. 25 this year, came 12 years after the previous one, held in March 2010.\n\n“The gap between the meetings should tell you how effective JRC is and what kind of priority it receives from the government,” said Sheikh Rokon, general secretary of the Riverine People, a river conservation group. He added the JRC in any case is only a facilitator, with no decision-making authority.\n\n“It is the government’s role to discuss and solve the crisis, not the JRC’s,” said Rokon, also a former JRC member. “The meeting is supposed to be held between the governments at the bureaucratic level.”\n\nNishat said he believes the lack of action on shared water management will lead to a crisis at some point as demand for water rises in both countries.\n\n“We need a comprehensive management plan for the entire basin area by conserving the monsoon water,” he said.\n\nBanner image: Boats on the Padma River, which is the main distributary of the Ganges flowing into Bangladesh.

    "Bangladesh: First visit by UN human rights expert on climate change": "GENEVA (29 August 2022) – UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights in the context of climate change, Ian Fry, will visit Bangladesh from 4 to 15 September 2022.\n\nThis is the first official visit by the UN expert since he took office on 1 May 2022.\n\nDuring the visit, the UN expert will assess how the adverse impact of climate change affects human rights of communities in vulnerable situations. The Special Rapporteur will focus on loss and damage incurred due to climate change and extreme weather.\n\n“The impacts of climate change continue to take a huge economic and social toll on the people of Bangladesh. Studies indicate that globally, costs related to loss and damage from climate change impacts will rise to between $290 billion and $580 billion a year by 2030. The people of Bangladesh are suffering from the greenhouse gas pollution caused by the developed world. It is time the international community stepped up and took responsibility for these impacts,” the UN expert said.\n\n“I will also pay special attention and explore how climate change impacts are forcing people to be displaced from their land and what measures are being taken to address these impacts,” he said.\n\nThe UN expert will identify good practices, strategies and policies implemented by the Government of Bangladesh, as the country adapts to climate change and builds resilience to its adverse impacts for the full and effective enjoyment of human rights.\n\nFry will travel to Dhaka, Khulna, and Sylhet to meet with communities affected by climate change. He will also meet central and local district government officials, and representatives from civil society.\n\nA news conference to share the expert’s preliminary findings will be held in Dhaka on 15 September, at 10:00 local time at the InterContinental Hotel (G, 1 Minto Rd, Dhaka 1000). Access is strictly limited to journalists.\n\nThe Special Rapporteur will present a comprehensive report on his visit to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva in June 2023.\n\nENDS\n\nMr. Ian Fry is the first Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights in the context of climate change. He was appointed by the Human Rights Council at its 49th session in March 2022 and started his mandate on 1 May 2022. Mr. Fry is an international environmental law and policy expert. His focus has primarily focussed on mitigation policies and loss and damage associated the Paris Agreement, Kyoto Protocol and related instruments. He worked for the Tuvalu government for over 21 years and was appointed as their Ambassador for Climate Change and Environment 2015-2019.\n\nThe Special Rapporteurs are part of what is known as the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council. Special Procedures, the largest body of independent experts in the UN Human Rights system, is the general name of the Council's independent fact-finding and monitoring mechanisms that address either specific country situations or thematic issues in all parts of the world. Special Procedures' experts work on a voluntary basis; they are not UN staff and do not receive a salary for their work. They are independent from any government or organization and serve in their individual capacity.",
    "Vision impairment affects earnings and safety in Bangladesh": "Reviewed by Jennifer L. Patnaik, PhD\n\nOrbis International has focused on vision impairment related to workers in low- and middle-income countries. To no one’s surprise, unaddressed visual problems negatively affect both the level of safety and the earnings of workers in these underdeveloped countries. Simple, readily available solutions can profoundly impact poverty reduction, gender disparities, and road safety.\n\nBus crashes\n\nInvestigators led by Munir Ahmed, MS, MBBS, country director for Orbis International in Bangladesh, found that visual problems were factors in bus crashes in Bangladesh and called for appropriate screening to identify affected drivers. The study data were recently published in a special edition of Asia-Pacific Journal of Ophthalmology.1\n\nOrbis International in Dhaka, Bangladesh, with local partner Grameen GC Eye Hospital, conducted eye health screenings including refraction and the distribution of questionnaires at 10 bus terminals in 7 districts of Bangladesh, from June through August 2019. Near and distance visual impairment and self-reported traffic crashes were recorded among 700 drivers.\n\nNearly 1 in 5 bus drivers had a presenting visual acuity (VA) in the better-seeing eye of 6/9 or lower, which is below the vision standard required in Bangladesh for driving a bus. Most drivers, 70.3%, had a near or distance refractive error. Of those who fell below the driving standard, the vast majority, 88.1%, achieved improved vision with simple measures—by either wearing glasses or undergoing cataract surgery. Almost 9% of the drivers reported ever having 1 or more traffic crashes while driving a bus or minibus.\n\nThe factors identified as being associated with near or distance visual impairment were older age (odds ratio [OR]/year, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.12-1.18; P < .0001] and not having a driver’s license [OR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.04-3.13; P = .037). A self-reported history of a motor vehicle crash was associated with near or distance visual impairment (OR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.09-5.49; P = .030),even when adjusting for other factors such as age and weekly miles driven.\n\nEnsuring that bus drivers are screened to meet the required vision standards for driving and referring those who do not meet the standard for treatment, which usually only requires wearing a pair of glasses, can contribute to safer roads in this high-risk setting. The investigators pointed out the alarming rate of crash fatality per capita in Bangladesh: It is 3 times higher than that in the South Asia region, and bus crashes are a high contributor to that statistic. In a recent 3-year period, about 50% of fatal crashes in the Dhaka metro area of Bangladesh involved buses compared with less than 1% in the United States and United Kingdom.\n\n“These findings underscore important recommendations for policy makers, including ensuring that specific vision standards are not only set for licensure, but also enforced by rigorous testing of all applicants, particularly those responsible for the safety of numerous other road users. Additionally, given the very high proportion of drivers with vision impairment due to readily treatable causes, referral for affordable and accessible care must be made for all those failing screening,” the authors commented.\n\nGarment workers in Bangladesh\n\nWomen largely comprise the population of individuals who work in the garment industry in Bangladesh. Visual problems among these workers are associated with lower monthly wages, according to findings from another recent study led by Ahmed.2\n\n“Given that women constitute the majority of workers in the garment industry globally, the study offers evidence that increasing access to quality eye care can help increase earnings among female workers and has the potential to pull more women out of poverty,” Ahmed commented.\n\nConsidering that garment production accounts for over 80% of Bangladesh’s total export earnings and that 4 million workers are involved in the industry, alleviating vision-related problems would have a profound effect on both workers and country. Most of the tasks of cutting material and sewing require good near vision.\n\nA total of 915 women, aged 18 to 70 years, were included in the study, which was conducted at 4 factories in Bangladesh. Of the participants, 29.2% (n = 267) and 26.8% (n = 245) had correctable distance and near vision impairment, respectively, the authors reported.\n\nThe prevalence of near vision impairment was significantly (P < .0001) higher among rural residents (34.2%) than urban residents (19.0%). The greatest differences were seen in women aged 35 to 39 years (68.2% vs 44.2%, respectively; P = .0019) and those over 40 years (85.9% vs 48.9%; P < .0001).\n\nThe treatment of presbyopia is simple and requires the wearing of glasses in most cases. When this is addressed, the study investigators suggest earnings could increase by about $70 US annually; this difference is equivalent to 6 weeks of income over the World Bank’s poverty line and can cover almost 1 month of expenses for a child. This increase also can translate into gains for the factories involved in garment production.\n\n“This study proposes solutions such as workplace screenings and the provision of glasses as a scalable strategy for poverty reduction. Additionally, by fighting preventable vision loss in industries with a high proportion of female workers, we can begin to address gender disparities and combat the adverse economic impact of gender inequality,” the investigators concluded.\n\n“These 2 studies in Bangladesh demonstrate the powerful impact of vision impairment on traffic safety and income potential,” said Jennifer L. Patnaik, PhD, a volunteer faculty member at Orbis International and principal investigator for both studies. “Our work at Orbis seeks to improve the well-being of individuals in countries where visual health issues are underaddressed.”\n\nReferences\n\n1.

    "Do Bangladeshi Hindus feel safe?": "The lead-up to Durga Puja, Bangladesh's biggest Hindu festival, is the busiest time of the year for Anil Krishna Pal. The 55-year-old and his team are crafting the structures and idols that are worshiped at temples during the festival. This year he has received 20 orders.\n\n\"First, we make this background frame with wood and bamboo. Then we make an idol structure with hay and set it on the frame. After that we start the clay work,\" Pal told DW.\n\n\"It takes eight days to finish the basic structure and the clay work. Then we need two more days to color it,\" he explained as he showed DW an array of idols.\n\nPal's workshop is located in the southeastern Bangladeshi city of Cumilla where last year a mob of angry Muslims attacked Hindu temples during the Durga Puja celebrations.\n\nWhat happened last year?\n\nWidely circulated footage on social media purported to show a copy of the Quran being placed on the lap of the Hindu deity Hanuman.\n\nThe video was seen as insulting by many of Bangladesh's Muslim majority and provoked hundreds to protest in more than a dozen districts. Houses belonging to Hindus were attacked and seven people were killed.\n\nThe idol that appeared in the footage had been crafted by Anil Krishna Pal.\n\n\"I felt very bad. What else could I feel? The idol that I made myself was destroyed — we could not even provide offerings. Isn't it a matter of sorrow? We give blessings and pray to the idol. My heart broke,\" Pal said.\n\nThe incident was later revealed to have been a deliberate ploy to provoke religious tensions.\n\nCCTV footage showed a man placing the Quran on the idol in a temple. He was later arrested.\n\nLast year, thousands of Muslims protested during Durga Puja against a video that they perceived as being insulting to Islam\n\nTemple attacked\n\nRatna Das, 45, who lives in a Hindu-majority neighborhood, witnessed last year's sectarian violence.\n\n\"Our area was the second to get attacked,\" she told DW. \"The young men and women from our neighborhood resisted and protected our temple. Now we have built this gate to stop any unwanted breaking in.\"\n\n\"However, they vandalized other neighborhoods here,\" Das added.\n\n\"The main entrance [of another temple] was destroyed. They vandalized the festive decorations, sound boxes, lights etc. Many people were injured,\" she said.\n\nCelebration 'with fear'\n\nAttacks on Hindus and other religious minorities are not uncommon in Bangladesh. According to Ain o Salish Kendra (ASK), a Bangladeshi human rights organization, even before last year's Durga Puja, there had been attacks on more than 100 Hindu homes.\n\nBetween 2013 and 2021, there were more than 3,500 assaults on Hindus, including 1,678 attacks on temples and vandalism of idols.\n\n\"But we had not seen such attacks as last year's. Even our fathers and forefathers had not seen such incidents in Cumilla,\" Das told DW. \"That is why we are a little scared.\"\n\nRatna Das' neighbor, Nipa Pal, said: \"My eight-year-old daughter was asking me if there will be any Puja at all? We know we will celebrate the festival, but fear that such a situation might recur.\"\n\nAnil Krishna Pal crafts the idols who are worshipped at various different temples during Durga Puja\n\nPolice protection\n\nThis year's Durga Puja will be celebrated in more than 32,000 temples and makeshift temples across Bangladesh. Authorities have said that they don't expect situations like last year's to occur.\n\nBangladeshi Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal has held meetings with organizers and law enforcement agencies and insisted that security will be increased this year.\n\n\"I have asked the organizers to set up CCTV cameras in all the puja pavilions. We will deploy enough police or other law enforcing members,\" he told reporters.\n\nBangladeshi police said that they were assessing the risk across the country.\n\n\"We started taking security measures since the idols are being crafted,\" Md. Haider Ali Khan, Bangladesh Police's deputy inspector general, told DW.\n\n\"Our intelligence departments are collecting information so that we can assess the risk level and take measures accordingly.\"\n\nHowever, the Puja organizers are not completely satisfied with the current situation.\n\n\"We want to go to a societal system where no religious festival will need police security. That was the main meaning of our national independence. Here you will be celebrating Puja under police protection, that does not make any sense,\" Podder told DW.\n\nBangladeshi police have assessed the risk for thousands of Hindu temples across the country\n\nMuslim cleric calls for cohesion\n\nMeanwhile, ahead of Friday prayers at the central mosque in Dhaka, Baitul Mukarram, Muslim clerics preached about social cohesion. They said that Islam did not permit giving pain to the \"others.\"\n\n\"Islam says that if there are people from other religions, they should not be harmed by the acts of Muslims,\" said 20-year-old Islamic student Md. Shahidul Islam. He told DW that no religious values could be imposed on a person of a different belief.\n\nHis friend, Ali Hasan, said that he believed that hatred and fighting were not the solution to any misunderstandings. \"Our prophet has not taught us to hate people,\" he told DW.\n\nMeanwhile, the head cleric of Baitul Mukarram called for proper action to prevent crimes against minorities. \"The government should ensure that such incidents should not happen again,\" Hafez Mawlana Mufti Ruhul Amin told DW. \"They must take action. They should keep an eye on such perpetrators.\"\n\nHow active is the government?\n\nThere seemed to be a general impression that Bangladesh's ruling Awami League got most of the minority votes because it does not lean to the religious far right, even though Hindu leaders have complained that the government has failed to protect them.\n\n\"It is very frustrating that the perpetrators go unpunished. So they feel encouraged to stage the attacks one after another,\" Poddar told DW.\n\nPolice filed at least 52 cases following last year's Durga Puja attacks. They also arrested the main suspect and hundreds of others — but cases are still pending.\n\n\"We have submitted the investigation reports of most of the cases to the court. Some investigations are still underway,\" DIG Khan told DW.\n\nHafez Mawlana Mufti Ruhul Amin has called for proper action from the government to prevent crimes against minorities\n\nShahriar Kabir, a Bangladesh-based journalist and researcher on communal conflict, said that the government has to be proactive.\n\n\"We have advised [it] to take short-term and long-term measures to make the country safe for the religious minorities,\" Kabir said.\n\n\"In the short term, they have to make sure the victims get justice by punishing the perpetrators. In the long term, we ask them to form a national minority commission or pass a minority protection law.\"\n\nBack in Cumilla, Ratna Das finished her evening prayers in the temple. In her mind, there was a list of things that she wants to buy for the Puja celebration and a question.\n\n\"This is my country. Isn't it weird that I now have to think about safety during Puja?\"\n\nEdited by: Keith Walker",

    "Lack of finance prevents Bangladesh farmers from diversifying their rice crops": "About 15 million farmers in Bangladesh grow just five to six rice varieties, despite the availability of more than 130 different rice varieties, giving rise to an effective monoculture that leaves farmers at higher risk from pests and diminishing yields.\n\nObservers attribute this to a lack of support from the government to help farmers explore other rice varieties, which typically have lower yields and fetch lower prices than the most popular varieties.\n\nLack of financial support means many farmers have to take out high-interest microcredit loans for their operational expenses, which in turn compels them to grow the most profitable rice varieties, locking them in a vicious cycle.\n\nObservers have called on the government to do more to incentivize farmers to diversity their rice crops, pointing to long-term benefits in the form of improved soil health and resilience to pest attacks.\n\nBangladesh is home to more than 130 different rice varieties, but a lack of economic incentives means farmers here grow only a handful of the higher-yielding types. This has given rise to a virtual monocrop system, which farmers and experts say threatens both long-run production and soil quality.\n\nMost farmers, meanwhile, blame a vicious cycle of dependence on high interest micro-credit for agro-input, which leaves them overdependent on high yield varieties, and little room to experiment with other varieties.\n\nAbdur Razzak,a 48-year-old farmer in the northern district of Dinajpur, has for the past 15 years grown the most popular varieties — known as BRRI-28 and BRRI-29 — which yield around 6 metric tons of rice per hectare of land, or about 2.7 short tons per acre.\n\n“A couple of years back we tried BRRI-35,” he says. “[We] dropped it the next year as it yielded only about 3 [metric] tons per hectare,” or 1.3 short tons an acre. Making matters worse, the market price of BRRI-35 and other lesser-known varieties is lower than that of the popular varieties because of the lack of demand.\n\nLike Razzak, some 15 million farmers in Bangladesh depend just on five to six rice varieties in an effort to maximize their output, cultivating them on 8.6 million hectares (21.3 million acres) of land. That’s made Bangladesh the fourth-highest rice-producing country in the world, churning out 36 million metric tons of rice annually to feed its 170 million people.\n\nOther popular varieties are BRRI-58, 50, 63 and 74, all named after the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute that developed them. But it’s BRRI-28 and 29 that dominate, accounting for around 50% of all the rice grown in the country, because of their better yields and market price.\n\nBoth farmers and researchers say the return on investment is the main reason for this practice, which has given rise to an effective monoculture. The high cost of production — ranging from irrigation and labor to fertilizers and pesticides — as well uncompetitive prices mean farmers have no incentive to explore beyond the dominant varieties.\n\nLack of access to affordable financing\n\nIn a country where agriculture is a mainstay of the economy and farmers play the chief role in ensuring food security, farmers have little formal access to low-cost financing for their operational needs.\n\nGenerally, there are three sources of financial support available to Bangladeshi farmers. First, there are dadon, local lenders who charge exorbitant interest rates on loans that must be paid back in weekly installments. Then there are nongovernmental organizations that provide microcredit loans, followed by state-owned banks.\n\nAlthough the latter, with their lower interest rates, would be the ideal option for farmers, most shy away from banks because of the convoluted bureaucracy. The government established the Bangladesh Krishi Bank in 1973 with the aim of supporting farmers, but even today it hasn’t gained much traction.\n\n“Unfortunately, bureaucratic tangles, involvement of third parties in the loan disbursement process, and political intervention has made the bank ineffective,” said Fazle Rabbi Sadeque Ahmed, deputy managing director of the Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation (PKSF).\n\nBetween the dadon and the NGOs, farmers tend toward the latter. But even here, the loans aren’t cheap: the average annual interest rate is 31%.\n\n“We are forced to sell the paddy at a low price immediately after harvest to repay our loans,” said Dilip Kumar, a 40-year-old farmer from another northern district, Lalmonirhat. “If we wait to sell it, the interest on our loan will go up.”\n\nRisks of monocrop culture\n\n“If farmers cannot get a fair price for their produce and cannot access finance to meet their [production] needs on time, they will definitely go for varieties that have the best yield,” said Ahsan Uddin Ahmed, a researcher on environment and climate change issues.\n\nHe said that makes the predominance of monoculture the fault of the government, as it has failed to address the farmers’ interests by making it feasible for them to explore other rice varieties.\n\nA 2019 study suggested that adopting alternative varieties of rice could help Bangladeshi farmers avoid risks such as pest attacks and low yields in the long run — risks that grow the greater the overdependence on a few varieties.\n\nRepeated monocropping also degrades soil health, which Ahsan Uddin, who is a member of the Green Climate Fund’s Independent Technical Advisory Panel of the Green Climate Fund, also blamed on the government.\n\n“The farmers are not liable for the damage to soil health. It’s the state’s responsibility to ensure availability of technology, finance and cultivable varieties. The government has failed in this regard,” he said.\n\n“The government should introduce a mechanism so that farmers get a fair price for their production,” said Jibon Krisna Biswas, a former director-general of the BRRI. “Otherwise, they will continue to grow varieties like BRRI-28 and BRRI-29. This is leading to the monocrop culture, which will bring ecological ruin in the long run.”\n\nBanner image: Farmers with freshly harvested paddy.

    "Myanmar, Bangladesh must solve border tensions peacefully": "Many Rohingya people fled from Myanmar a few years ago in fear of their lives, but recently the Myanmar army has had to face strong resistance from other independence-seeking rebels. Along with the Arakan Army, the military is in serious conflict with the Cochin Army, and elements of the Shan, Karen, Mong, Shin and Kaya peoples.\n\nAs a result, the Tatmadaw (military) has adopted a slightly different strategy from its persecution of the Rohingya to avoid international surveillance of its suppression of the rebels. As a part of this, it has mounted a campaign on the border with Bangladesh.\n\nMyanmar has been firing mortar shells into the area. By creating pressure, the Tatmadaw hopes the remaining Rohingya in Myanmar will go to Bangladesh or elsewhere. As well, it hopes to incite Bangladesh into joining its war on the rebels. This will further increase the persecution of Rohingya.\n\nMeanwhile, the Myanmar army is placing landmines one after another in the border areas in violation of international norms. Earlier, Rohingya were killed by mines, but now Bangladeshis are also falling victim. The presence of the army in the border area without a declaration of war is against international norms, but Myanmar does not comply with these.\n\nThe Tatmadaw has also repeatedly violated Bangladesh’s airspace. As the Myanmar junta has acted with impunity in the past, it is again showing the audacity to violate international norms.\n\nBorder tensions\n\nHowever, the law and order forces of Bangladesh are on alert at the border and the situation is under constant observation.\n\nBangladesh has a 271-kilometer sea and land border with Myanmar. About 1.2 million Rohingya are in Teknaf and Ukhia, two subdistricts of Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, bordering Myanmar.\n\nBangladesh must avoid getting involved in the conflict on the Myanmar border. Doing so would benefit both the Tatmadaw and the rebel Arakan Army. Bangladesh should therefore make all efforts for a peaceful solution to the problem.\n\nAcross the Naikshyongchari border in Bandarban, the Myanmar army is engaged in a fierce battle with the Arakan Army. At this time, mortar shells are falling in Bangladesh. Helicopters are also entering the airspace of Bangladesh.\n\nThere is concern in Bangladesh due to border tensions. However, the Myanmar army is not carrying out any attack targeting Bangladesh. The Arakan Army is attacking Tatmadaw military posts along the border. Because of this, the Myanmar army is conducting an operation mere meters from the border with Bangladesh.\n\nThe tension on the border has been going on for quite some time. The tension sometimes increases and sometimes decreases. Lately there has been an increase in shelling and airspace violations. This is because the Arakan Army has increased its activity. As a result, the Tatmadaw has launched a major operation.\n\nThe violation of Bangladesh’s border by the Myanmar army is going to increase in the coming days. Boundary violations can be reduced by demonstrating the power Bangladesh has, rather than using it. As Bangladesh’s military and national strength are not visible to the Myanmar forces, they do not care about them.\n\nBangladesh should make every effort to solve the problem peacefully. Bangladesh has summoned Myanmar’s ambassador four times. But strength must be demonstrated behind diplomatic language.\n\nThe biggest concern is the fear of more Rohingya entering Bangladesh. Moreover, the operation of the Myanmar army is not limited only to the Rohingya region. People from other ethnic groups in Rakhine may also enter Bangladesh under the pressure of the campaign. Thus some people from Myanmar entered Mizoram in India.\n\nIt is not right for Bangladesh to get involved in the problems of Myanmar. Bangladesh says it has increased Border Guard Police (BGP) and Coast Guard deployments. But it will not be right for Bangladesh to deploy the army along the border at this time.\n\nAppeal to UN\n\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina is going to the United Nations General Assembly meeting and she is scheduled to address it on Friday. She will definitely raise the matter there. Besides, she should arrange a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping while both are in New York.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin is not going to the United Nations, but Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is. A K Abdul Momen, the foreign minister of Bangladesh, should arrange a meeting with him, as he is also going to the UNGA.\n\nFrom what can be understood from the international media, rebel groups in Myanmar claim that the army does not have control over 52% of the area in Rakhine state. The war with the Arakan Army has taken a prominent shape.\n\nMyanmar has proved in the past that it does not abide by international law or diplomacy. Therefore, Myanmar’s internal problems should be solved within the country and not outside. But Bangladesh has to internationalize this issue.\n\nProfessor Imtiaz Ahmed, of Dhaka University’s International Relations Department, said recently that internationalization of the issue needs to be increased.\n\nIf Bangladesh adopts a mixed strategy of demonstration of military power and diplomacy simultaneously, the Myanmar military can’t respond easily. Thus Bangladesh needs to pursue a peaceful diplomatic approach towards Myanmar.\n\nThe Myanmar military has little control over most of the remote mountainous areas except for the plains. The way the conflict is increasing in these areas, the junta government has indicated that elections next year will be very difficult.\n\nSheikh Hasina said recently that Bangladesh is showing maximum restraint on the Myanmar border. Keir Starmer, the leader of the UK opposition and head of the Labour Party, met with Hasina, who was visiting London on Saturday. At the time, she informed him about the growing burden on Bangladesh due to the prolonged presence of Rohingya from Myanmar.\n\nStarmer’s meeting with Sheikh Hasina discussed the recent escalation of armed conflict near the border with Bangladesh.\n\nShe said that despite the effects of the conflict in Myanmar spreading within the territory of Bangladesh, her country is exercising maximum restraint.\n\nIn order to assess the situation on the Myanmar border, Bangladeshi Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan on Wednesday convened a high-level meeting with the country’s security and law-enforcement organizations at his secretariat office.\n\nThe minister declared after the meeting that Bangladesh’s army and other forces were prepared to defend the nation if given the necessary instructions.\n\n“We have seen a number of provocations,” he said. “We think Bangladesh has no role to play as long as there is an internal conflict where the Arakan Army is fighting with [Myanmar armed forces].”\n\nIn a different broadcast on Wednesday, Bangladesh Army Chief General S M Shafiuddin Ahmed stated that his troops were prepared to respond against Myanmar if necessary.\n\nForeign interests\n\nBangladesh is on the right track so far without stepping into Myanmar’s trap. Solutions should be sought in all other ways than engaging in conflict. At the same time, Dhaka should increase the pressure on Naypyidaw through more engagement with China, India and member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.\n\nThere is a need to work hard with the ASEAN countries in this regard, because the victim of this conflict will be ASEAN in the future. War is not desirable for anyone. The Bangladeshi government’s diplomatic and military preparations need to be strengthened.\n\nDiplomacy also has different phases. One stage in this is the role of regional powers. They can play an effective role in ending this conflict. But so far they have shown little interest. So Bangladesh has to expand its diplomacy.\n\nMilitary diplomacy in addition to traditional diplomacy can help mitigate and de-escalate the tensions. In that case, a warning can be given to Myanmar by showing military force without getting involved in the conflict.\n\nIn the current situation, it is necessary to walk with prudence. All aspects including the Rohingya issue, national security and economic stability of Bangladesh must be calculated and considered seriously.",

    "Islamic Bangladesh celebrates its first women's football title in a frenzy": "The players of the Bangladesh women's national football team, who had to train in secret to avoid Islamist reprisals, were greeted this week as heroes on their return to the country, including a ride in a convertible bus, after winning the South Asian championship.\n\nBangladesh defeated Nepal 3-1 in the final of the South Asian Football Federation (SAFF) women's championship on Monday to win their first-ever title in a tournament led mainly by neighbouring India.\n\nSince then, the celebrations and the expressions of affection have not stopped among fans of the sport, who see this victory as an important milestone for the empowerment of women in the country.\n\n\"This is a great achievement for us. One of the best sporting achievements of our country, I would say. It was also the culmination of years of hard work by our girls,\" Bangladesh Football Federation president Kazi Salahuddin told Efe on Thursday after receiving some of the players.\n\nSuch is the furore over the milestone that Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina announced she would give cash prizes to all the team members in recognition of the victory and ordered houses to be built for the needy, Bangladesh's state-run agency BSS reported.\n\nThe Bangladesh Cricket Board also pledged a reward of $150,000 to be distributed among the players, most of whom come from low-income rural families.\n\nAfter their arrival in the capital on Wednesday, the players paraded through the streets of Dhaka in an open-top bus to receive the support of hundreds of fans who came to greet them, while local television channels carried live coverage of the four-hour journey.\n\nFor women's rights activist Maleka Banu, this achievement is more than just a title, as Bangladeshi women \"have to fight against a lot of odds. This is a victory against all kinds of regression. We hope it will be a big step forward for our girls\".\n\nBangladesh, ranked 147th in FIFA women's football, went into the SAFF tournament with low expectations, as neighbouring India had topped the competition in the previous five editions.\n\nThe team, led by striker Sabina Khatun, who was also named player of the tournament, scored 23 goals in the entire competition and conceded only one goal.\n\nA long, complex and secretive road\n\nBut the road to victory was far from easy for the Bangladesh women's football players.\n\n\"We had to organise a secret training camp, as many people in this society did not like the idea of girls playing football. There was no sponsor available for us,\" said former general secretary of the Bangladesh Women's Sports Federation, Qamrunnahar Dana.\n\nAlthough Bangladesh is known for its passion for football, it has not been able to achieve significant success. The one that resonates most in the country was the South Asian championship title won by the men's team in 2003.\n\nThe men's team is currently ranked 192nd, one of the lowest in the world, and only ahead of Pakistan and Sri Lanka in the region.\n\n\"Hopefully, this victory will open everyone's eyes,\" Dana said.",

    "Bangladesh external debt situation and vulnerabilities": "The surge in the current account deficit in FY2022 pushed by global inflation has led to considerable public discussion and debate about the Bangladesh external debt situation and associated vulnerabilities. The unprecedented current account deficit has led to considerable pressure on the exchange rate, increase in short-term borrowings, and a depletion of foreign exchange reserves. Many see these developments as evidence of growing vulnerability of the balance of payments and the external debt situation. There is also a worry that the scheduled repayment of loans for a number of large infrastructure projects in the coming years will add to these pressures.\n\nThis is a healthy debate, but it is important that the discussions must be based on solid data and evidence. All efforts must be made to avoid speculative analysis that is not backed by evidence. This note seeks to provide an analysis of the external debt situation, and the underlying issues and challenges, with a view to clarifying the public debate on the facts of external debt and assisting the government's thinking on how best to move forward to stabilise the macroeconomy.\n\nThe evolution and current structure of external debt is shown in Table 1. Bangladesh has traditionally managed its external debt prudently. It has maintained a surplus or low deficit in the current account; it has largely relied on publicly-funded low-cost medium- and long-term foreign borrowing to finance its trade and investment needs; and the use of short-term credit has been modest. Combined with a major export drive in RMG and labour exports, Bangladesh external debt indicators, both short- term and long-term, have been comfortable.\n\nThe emergence of Covid-19 created some external sector difficulties through the loss of export earnings, but recovery happened fairly swiftly. In FY2021, the balance of payments and external debt indicators were all in the prudent zone. The long-term debt sustainability indicators (debt to GDP; debt to exports, debt service to exports) were all in the comfortable zone. The short-term vulnerability indicators (short-term loan to reserves and the combined short-term loan plus current account deficit to reserves) were within prudential limits (well below 1).\n\nThe advent of global inflation fuelled by the Ukraine War since March 2022 has exerted some serious pressure on the Bangladesh external sector reflected in the soaring value of imports. The Bangladesh exchange rate depreciated sharply as excess demand for foreign exchange along with an appreciation of the US dollar in the global markets pushed up the taka price of dollar. The import surge caused the current account deficit to rise to an unprecedented $18.7 billion in FY2022. The financing of this huge deficit required a resort to short-term borrowing as well as a substantial loss of reserves.\n\nThe cumulative effect of these developments was that the short-term debt indicators worsened sharply. The short-term debt to reserve ratio worsened from 30% to 50% between FY2021 and FY2022, while the ratio of short-term debt and current deficit to reserves weakened dramatically from a low of 38% in FY2021 to a high of 94% in FY2022. The medium-to-long-term debt indicators, however, remain in the comfortable zone.\n\nHow vulnerable is the current debt situation? From a medium-to-long-term perspective, there is not much need to worry if exports remain stable. Simulations show that the medium-to-long-term debt sustainability indicators remain within prudent limits. This is true even after accounting for the upcoming repayment schedule of a number of infrastructure projects including the Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant (debt repayments of $569 million per year starting in FY2027), the Padma Bridge Rail Link (debt repayments of $176 million per year starting in FY2024), the Karnaphuli Tunnel (debt repayment of $53 million starting in FY23) and the Expansion and Strengthening of the Power System Network under the DPDC area ($67 million per year starting in FY2025).\n\nThe short-term debt risk situation is tricky and could present a challenge. The sharp deterioration in the short -term debt indicators in FY2022 noted above needs to be reversed and stabilised. While they are still within prudential norms (ratio of less than 1), given the uncertainties of the Ukraine War and global inflation, Bangladesh would be well advised to protect its foreign exchange reserves against any further decline, while seeking to lower the current account deficit in the immediate short term (FY2023). This will require keeping the current account deficit at a level that can be fully financed through net MLT loans and net FDI flows, and a roll-over of the $20.7 billion short-term debt at a reasonable cost. These in turn will require stabilising the macroeconomy by using a combination of monetary, fiscal and exchange rate policies.\n\nThe main policy reforms entail unification of the exchange rate at the market determined rate with one exchange rate for all transactions (exports, imports and remittances), doing away with subsidies on exports and remittances, removing the interest rate caps to lower demand through an adjustment in the interest rate, preparing for a major overhaul of the tax system to strengthen revenue mobilisation, reforming the state owned enterprises to eliminate operating subsidies and earning a reasonable rate of return on invested assets, and increasing expenditure on health, education and social protection.\n\nSadiq Ahmed is the vice chairman at Policy Research Institute of Bangladesh",

    "Demand for sand in Bangladesh escalates illegal activities, threatens environment": "Demand from Bangladesh’s construction industry for sand has led to a boom in unregulated and illegal mining from rivers, activists say.\n\nThis extracted sand flows into the country year-round through 57 transboundary rivers from India and Myanmar. In all, these waterways carry around 2.4 billion metric tons of sediment, including sand, clay and silt.\n\nExcessive sand mining is destroying the ecology of river systems as well as their biodiversity, and increasing the risk of river erosion, a study says.\n\nA 2010 law meant to keep sand mining in check has instead allowed the illegal industry to thrive, critics say, thanks to weak punishment, lax enforcement, and the involvement of politically connected players in the business.\n\nThere is an increasing demand for sand from Bangladesh’s construction industry that has led to an escalation in sand mining. An illegal industry has spread that now overshadows the legal one. The mining is also destroying ecosystems and exacerbating river erosion.\n\nAs Bangladesh’s cities and towns grow on the back of solid economic growth over the past three decades, the construction industry has resorted to extracting sand from rivers nationwide. This sand flows into the country year-round through 57 transboundary rivers from India and Myanmar. In all, these waterways carry around 2.4 billion metric tons of sediment, including sand, clay and silt.\n\nA large part of the extracted sand is used as landfill to reclaim new land in a country where much of the area is part of a delta. These new lands, often created by filling in canals and drains, pose an obstacle to the flow of the monsoon runoff.\n\nThe sand mining itself poses a threat to all kinds of physical infrastructure, including homes, agricultural lands, schools, bridges, and embankments in the river. It also destroys the adjoining groundwater system, according to a recent study.\n\nHotspots of illegal sand mining include districts in the Ganges River Basin and the Meghna River Basin.\n\nThe Bangladesh government has long been aware of the problem, and in 2010 passed the Quarry and Soil Management Act to control sand mining activities. But critics say the law is neither effective at discouraging sand mining, nor is it enforced seriously by the government.\n\nAdverse impacts\n\nAs a result of the unregulated extraction of sand, Bangladesh’s floodplains are sinking deeper, raising the probability of worsening floods and flood damage. And by altering the pattern of riverbeds and coastal areas, sand mining is responsible for causing harm to several species of flora and fauna.\n\n“Alongside natural causes, unplanned sand mining is one of the major causes of river erosion in Bangladesh,” said Maminul Haque Sarker, senior adviser on river, delta and coastal morphology at the Center for Environmental and Geographic Information Services (CEGIS).\n\n“Extreme mining of sand causes the degradation of rivers and their channels. The mining process creates holes in the bed, which leads to riverbank erosion,” he said.\n\nIn recent years, CEGIS has been monitoring erosion caused by three major rivers in Bangladesh: the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna. In 2019, it recorded 725 hectares (1,792 acres) of land swallowed by the Brahmaputra and 1,240 hectares (3,064 acres) lost to the Ganges (the lower stretch of which is known in Bangladesh as the Padma).\n\nIn 2020, more land was lost to these rain-swollen rivers: 1,120 hectares (2,768 acres) to the Brahmaputra and 1,265 hectares (3,126 acres) to the Ganges. Roads, arable land, schools, health facilities, government and nongovernment establishments stood on this land that had been eroded.\n\nWeak law, weak enforcement\n\nEnvironmental activists and lawyers are critical of the Quarry and Soil Management Act because of the numerous loopholes that exist in it.\n\nThe law permits local governments to declare a particular area a “sand quarry” based on the suggestions of a committee, without specifying the criteria for identifying a quarry. The law also doesn’t require miners to carry out an environmental impact assessment (EIA) before starting extraction activities.\n\nIn India, the government has long required an EIA be carried out for sand mining, and in 2016 extended that requirement to projects in areas smaller than 5 hectares.\n\n“We have a very weak legal framework and even this weak legal framework is not implemented,” said Syeda Rizwana Hasan, an environmental lawyer and activist. She added that influential local players with political connections are major stakeholders in the sand extraction business.\n\n“The weak act is always giving them an escape route. Sometimes, they run their operations in front of the local administration by exerting influence through the presence of thugs,” Rizwana said.\n\nBangladesh also doesn’t track statistics on sand extraction, said Rizwana, who is also the chief executive of the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (BELA). She said it can be assumed that about 60-70% of the total mined sand in the Bangladeshi market is illegally extracted.\n\nBELA has filed at least 300 lawsuits against illegal mining across the country in recent years. “None of the convicted received exemplary punishment, as the act allows them to secure release by paying a small fine,” Rizwana said.\n\nOut of control\n\nBecause of the poor legal framework and the massive profits involved, influential people with political connections are increasingly getting into the sand mining business. Their presence makes it difficult and dangerous to speak out, environmental activists say.\n\nLocal government officials have been physically assaulted when trying to inspect allegations of illegal mining, as have journalists investigating the issue, according to local media. In 2012, three people were detained in 2012 in a fabricated lawsuit filed by a sand mining company, according to a report by the Asian Human Rights Commission.\n\nCITATION:\n\nRentier, E.

    "Bangladesh allows construction on troubled elevated transit line to resume": "Five members of a family were killed when a girder from the construction of an elevated transit corridor fell and crushed their car along the Dhaka-Mymensingh national highway, Aug. 15, 2022.\n\nBangladesh’s government has allowed a Chinese contractor to resume construction of an elevated rapid bus route after suspending the project in the wake of a girder falling and killing five people in a car last month, officials said.\n\nAuthorities have also granted the Gezhouba Group Company, a road-building firm from mainland China, a one-year extension on the project after it gave the government assurances about implementing safety measures to prevent other accidents from happening, officials told BenarNews.\n\n“China’s Gezhouba Group Company has been permitted to resume the construction work as they have adopted safety measures at the project site. We want them to finish the work as soon as possible,” A.B.M Amin Ullah Nuri, the secretary of the Road Transport and Highways Division, told BenarNews.\n\n“The project is already behind schedule; how long will we make people suffer for the project?” said the official, who also chairs the state agency implementing the Dhaka Bus Rapid Transit line (DBRT).\n\nThe deadly accident on Aug. 15 was the latest mishap to occur during construction of the 20.2-km (12.5-mile) overhead rapid transit bus corridor. Five members of a family, including two children and a newlywed couple, were killed when the falling girder crushed their car as they were driving underneath the construction site of the elevated transit line.\n\nA government investigation into the incident found that the China Gezhouba Group Co., a subsidiary of the China Gezhouba Group Corp. (CGGC), was responsible for the accident by not ensuring people’s safety in or near the project site.\n\nThe project, valued at 42.6 billion taka (U.S. $450 million), is being financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Nuri said.\n\nOnce completed, the transit line will connect the neighboring Gazipur district with Dhaka’s Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, in a project that aims to ease traffic congestion on a busy highway connecting the two points.\n\n“We have to work with the ADB to take action against the contracting company. We are working with them in this regard,” Nuri said without elaborating.\n\nIn 2016, the Gezhouba Group was awarded the contract for the project. Its original end-date was June 2020, but the project got delayed multiple times amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and the company was then given a new deadline for finishing the project by June 2021.\n\n“Thus far, nearly 80 percent of the project has been finished. We want the physical construction of the project to finish by March next year. So, we have proposed the planning commission to extend the deadline for the company to December 2023,” Shafiqul Islam, the managing director of the DBRT company, told BenarNews.\n\nWhen asked whether the government was considering cancelling the contract and finding a new builder for the transit line, he replied: “This is very difficult to change the contractor of an ongoing project. We will not change the contractor CGGC.”\n\n“There are … provisions for punishment in the contract, but applying the provisions is realistic,” Islam added.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in Dhaka did not immediately respond to BenarNews requests for comment.\n\nLawsuit\n\nTen people, all Bangladeshi nationals connected with the Chinese company, have been arrested in connection with the Aug. 15 accident but have been freed on bail.\n\nMeanwhile, a plaintiff in a lawsuit brought against the company over the latest incident told BenarNews that senior officials of CGGC went to his home in Dhaka recently.\n\n“They offered us Tk two million for each family as compensation so that we could withdraw the case. But we have not accepted their proposal,” said Md. Afran Mondal Babu, who is suing the company for culpable homicide not amounting to murder.\n\n“The police had not arrested any official of the Chinese company. Some local staff of the project were arrested and all of them have been [released] on bail,” said Babu.\n\n“We have asked for Tk 30 million (U.S. $287,240) for the settlement. And they rejected our offer,” he said.",

    "Millennials of Bangladesh: The generation that grew in democracy, neoliberalism and disparity": "Kazuyo Minamide, a Japanese anthropologist, stayed in Bangladesh for more than 20 years and observed a generation growing up and their transformation through the various stages of their lives - navigating things like life goals and identity politics.\n\nIn 2002, she studied in class four at a primary school in Jamalpur with 38 students. She refers to these 38 as her \"classmates\". Since then, she has documented how her classmates' lives took shape in the Bangladeshi socio-economic context.\n\nHer book Millennial Generation in Bangladesh examines how the characteristics and experiences of the generation born in the 1990s reflect broader changes taking place in Bangladesh.\n\nAlthough the book was published this year in March, the launching programme was held much later on 7 September.\n\nMembers of this generation were born during a political transition period and saw the revival of democracy after a series of military regimes, and they grew up in a society directly influenced by the global push toward neoliberalism. Their struggle represents the dilemmas of contemporary Bangladeshi society in the global setting.\n\nAssisted by eight erudite professors and researchers in the field, the eight-chapter book anthropologically describes different groups of Bangladesh's 1990s generation. Based on fieldwork experience, each author investigates their subjects and examines how they struggle with their specific set of circumstances.\n\nSince 1990, Bangladesh has undertaken various initiatives to ensure the rights of children. With approaches like reproductive care and child nutrition, the rate of infant and child mortality has subsequently declined, making 1990's kids the largest population cohort in the nation's history.\n\nSupported by international aid and other stakeholders, universal education has been a massive priority since Bangladesh's independence. Education became the arena where the aims of the global society for Bangladesh and national globalisation initiatives met. And this Y generation was at the centre of this union, making them the first globally educated generation.\n\nTherefore, the generation underwent many experimental phases. For example, after the 1990s, there were huge changes in every stage of education.\n\nEducation in Bangladesh has three main streams based on the language of education: the Bangla medium, the majority, the English medium, primarily for the economically privileged class, and the Madrasa, which is also divided into Qawmi and Aliya, based on Islamic education.\n\nFor higher studies, there are public universities, private universities and national universities. Again, the national university contains two different curricula for honours courses and degree courses.\n\nEducation by multiple providers and inconsistent policy has meant that not everyone has received a standardised education. The qualitative disparities and a lack of secondary education access have resulted in the majority of the 1990s generation only completing primary school.\n\nHuge qualitative inequality exists among all streams of education. As a result, the more the access to education increased, the more the disparity was exposed.\n\nHowever, the primary school enrollment rate of girls has dramatically increased and exceeded that of boys at the same time, thanks to the support and pressure of international aid. Formal education has created a 'youth period' that did not, at least for young women, exist for previous generations.\n\nMinamide's studies show that more than half of the 1990's generation left their education by the end of the 10th grade. Only 10% to17% remained enrolled in tertiary education. So, in order to fully understand the current situation of the 1990's generation, we, therefore, must look beyond their educational experience.\n\nThere are huge socioeconomic and cultural disparities between the majority cohort, those who received only primary education, and the rest who have got their higher education at universities.\n\nThe effects of globalisation also impact these groups differently. With the advent of global connectivity, a part of the generation became liberal while another group grew fanatic, resulting in events like the 2016 attack on the Holey Artisan Bakery in Dhaka, commented Minamide.\n\nAlthough contemporary youth in Bangladesh are actively involved in cyberspace, the ways in which they use and communicate online vary significantly.\n\nOn the one hand, they are connected and consuming the global imaginary, while on the other hand, they are separated by the need to react and create their sociality.\n\nChapters 1 and 2 focus on working garment factories as the majority of wage labourers in this sector are members of the 1990s generation. For living, they moved to urban areas, and the author explores whether these youth, through their urban experiences, have urbanised their lifestyle or sense of belonging.\n\nEmployment allowed women to live independently or earn the primary family income, but the belief in an ideal marriage, in which the husband was the main provider, remained intact. According to Minamide the core circumstances for women haven't changed.\n\nThe following couple of chapters investigate the links between higher education and career aspirations among the generation, showing why these young cohorts consider government jobs as the only option that can give them a fair chance to move up both socially and economically.\n\nChapters 5 and 6 deal with the identity politics of urban youth. The final two chapters explore how online identities affected the generation. For the urban youth, the author notes, this online space became the means of debate, discussion, interaction and socialisation, which gave birth to many movements throughout the country.\n\nMinamide ends the book by providing limitations of their study and leaving aspects to be discovered by future researchers.",
    "\"Saudi Arabia will always remain beside Bangladesh\"": "Saudi Arabia will always remain beside Bangladesh in various aspects in order to make its dream come true towards the development, Saudi Ambassador to Bangladesh Essa bin Yousef Al Duhailan said.\n\nIn a message marking the 92nd Saudi National Day today (September 24, 2022), he said Saudi-Bangladesh relation is deep rooted and excellent based on strong foundation of religious, cultural, economic and humanitarian ties.\n\n\"Saudi Arabia always stands beside Bangladesh helping it, especially in the time of hardship,\" he said.\n\nEssa bin Yousef said Saudi-Bangladesh relations witnessed more strength after the visit of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to the Kingdom in 2016 and meeting with the King of Saudi Arabia King Salman Bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud, as well as frequent high-level visits by a number of Bangladeshi high officials to Saudi Arabia and vise-versa.\n\n\"Apart from this, nowadays, Saudi companies also have expressed their cordial eagerness to invest in Bangladesh in various sectors because of peace, political stability, rules-regulations and good incentives.\n\n\"This will help to take the bilateral strong relationship into a new height as well as assist Bangladesh government to fulfill its vision of reaching in the list developing country by 2026.\"\n\nHe said Bangladesh gives great importance to the Kingdom, which extended help to improve the living standards and socio-economic development of Bangladesh.\n\nOn the other hand, around 2.6 million Bangladeshis are working in the Kingdom, the largest overseas labour market of Bangladesh. They send more than $3.5 billion remittance every year.\n\nThe Kingdom has a great contribution to betterment of the living standards of all people of this country.

    "For lightning-prone communities in Bangladesh, new warning system may not be enough": "An average of four people a week are killed by lightning in Bangladesh, and the problem is expected to get worse as climate change increases the frequency of lightning strikes.\n\nMost of the victims tend to be farmers and fishers, who, like members of other poor communities around the world, are bearing the brunt of climate change impacts.\n\nThe Bangladesh Meteorological Department has rolled out an early-warning system, based on modeling developed in collaboration with NASA, that it says will provide up to 54 hours’ warning of potential lightning strikes.\n\nBut experts say the communities most in need of these alerts are those who don’t have access to the technology, and have called for other measures, such as building lightning arresters in open fields and wetlands, to protect vulnerable communities.\n\nDHAKA – On July 30 this year, Moza Mia took his two buffalo out to graze in the field near his home in Bangladesh’s northern Lalmonirhat district. Soon after, lightning struck, and Moza, 52, was killed instantly, along with his two buffalo.\n\nTwo days earlier, Jain Uddin, a farmer in Sunamganj, in the country’s northeast, was working in his field in front of his home when lightning struck, also killing him on the spot. Also in Sunamganj that day, Tera Mia, a fisherman, was killed in a strike while fishing in a wetland near his village.\n\nDeath by lightning is a relatively common phenomenon in Bangladesh. According to the country’s Department of Disaster Management, 2,164 people were killed in lightning strikes from 2011 to 2020, or about four people a week.\n\nBut this is an underestimate of the true toll, said Gawher Nayeem Wahra, member secretary of the Foundation for Disaster Forum, a coalition of humanitarian NGOs.\n\n“The actual death toll from lightning strikes is much higher than the official figure as the concerned government agency counts lightning death cases only reported in newspapers,” Wahra said.\n\nThe Foundation for Disaster Forum estimates 3,273 people were killed in lightning strikes between 2010 and 2021, with 363 deaths in 2021 alone. As of August this year, 228 people have been killed by lightning, according to data from the Save the Society and Thunderstorm Awareness Forum (SSTAF).\n\nFarmers and fishers like Moza and Jain and Tera account for most of the victims, and as is often the case around the world, it’s members of poorer communities who are most at risk as a changing climate threatens to increase the frequency of lightning strikes.\n\nHeightened risk of lightning\n\nBangladesh is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change impacts, ranging from rising sea levels to increased water temperature to more frequent and intense cyclones. The changing climate is also driving an increase in lightning strikes by inputting more heat and moisture — the key components required to accumulate energy for lightning — into the atmosphere.\n\nIn Bangladesh, lightning strikes generally take place during the monsoon and pre- and post- monsoon seasons, and this window is widening due to changing weather patterns. That translates into more days in the year during which lightning strikes are likely.\n\nThe rising temperature is also a factor: A 2014 study in the U.S. projected that with every rise in the average global temperature of 1° Celsius (1.8° Fahrenheit) increases the frequency of lightning by 12%. In Bangladesh’s northern Rangpur district, the average temperature increased by 1.2°C (2.16°F) between 1984 and 2013, according to a 2018 study. Thunderstorms and lightning strikes in the area have increased in frequency during this period.\n\nAnother study, from 2021, shows that lightning strikes have a positive and statistically significant relation with climatic variables like temperature, rainfall, humidity and air pressure. It warns that lightning strikes may become more frequent in Bangladesh.\n\nThe Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) is disseminating live maps using numerical models, indicating the most potential lightning-prone areas. The red areas are considered most likely to be struck by lighting.\n\nEarly-warning system\n\nThe Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) recently adopted an early-warning system, known as a high-impact weather assessment toolkit, or HIWAT, to more accurately forecast thunderbolt and lightning strikes. It says the toolkit, part of a collaboration with NASA, will allow it to issue an advisory up to 54 hours before a lightning strike.\n\n“Since 2016, lightning strikes have been increasing in Bangladesh. Taking this into account, BMD introduced the HIWAT to issue more accurate operational forecasts,” Abdul Mannan, a meteorologist at the BMD’s Storm Warning Centre, told Mongabay.\n\nThe system builds on weather data going back 20 years. By applying numerical modelling, the high impact toolkit can now forecast how many lightning flashes will occur in a specific area, how many flashes will occur every hour and the coverage of a lightning flash in an area.\n\n“The system was integrated into the BMD so that it could provide lightning forecasts within the shortest possible time,” Mannan said.\n\nThese forecasts can then be disseminated to the affected regions, where “the people must be made aware of the forecasts,” Mannan said.\n\nHowever, it’s precisely those people who are most vulnerable to lightning strikes, such as farmers and fishermen, who likely won’t have access to the forecasts generated by the BMD, experts say.\n\n“Those who work in open fields or catch fish in open waterbodies are affected more. The death toll from lightning strikes is much higher than people dying from natural disasters like cyclone and floods,” said Rashim Mollah, general secretary of the Save the Society and Thunderstorm Awareness Forum.\n\nAccording to an SSTAF report, farmers accounted for 122 of the 177 people killed in lightning strikes across Bangladesh between March 31 and June 7 in 2021. Of 228 killed as of Aug. 18 this year, 145 were farmers and 29 were fishers.\n\n“Death from lightning mainly happen to people who work in the outdoors, and yet there is no location- and time-specific warning system for the local level community in Bangladesh,” said Mohan Kumar Das, a climate scientist at the Bangkok-based think tank Regional Integrated Multi-Hazard Early Warning System.\n\nFarmers and fishers tend to be poor and have no alternative but go out daily to earn a livelihood, even in adverse weather conditions, said Wahra from the Foundation for Disaster Forum.\n\n‘Take shelter’\n\nWith climate change set to increases the frequency of lightning strikes, experts say the Bangladesh government should introduce further steps such as lightning arresters to reduce people’s vulnerability and loss of lives to the phenomenon.\n\nOne initiative the government is already taking is to plant palm trees along roads, which would effectively serve as lightning rods in the absence of other tall structures. But Wahra said it will take time to see any results from this project, as the trees need a long time to grow to full height.\n\nExperts have also called for lightning arresters to be installed in open fields and wetlands in the absence of trees.\n\n“Lighting arresters can be installed on electric poles too, and Nepal has already had remarkable success in the Terai region by setting up such arresters,” Wahra said.\n\nWithout such measures, vulnerable populations are essentially on their own. Mannan from the BMD said people should take shelter in safe places if they see flashes in the sky, as lightning usually starts striking the ground 30 minutes to an hour after cloud-to-cloud flashes start.\n\n“When black clouds [cumulonimbus] accumulate in the sky, cloud-to-cloud flashes start,” he said.\n\n“If farmers working in open fields or fishermen in rivers and wetlands stop work for 30 minutes and go take shelter upon spotting black clouds in the sky, they will be able to protect themselves from potential lightning strikes.” the meteorologist said.\n\nBanner image: Fishermen going out to the river in Banglaesh.

    "Comilla Victorians owners to stay on till BPL 2025": "The tournament, which had shrunk to six teams last year, has expanded back to its usual seven now\n\nThe owners of Comilla Victorians will stick around to see their team defend the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) title next year. Last month, there were reports that Comilla Legends Ltd had failed to submit Expression of Interest (EOI) papers, but in an announcement on Sunday, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) confirmed that the Victorians will remain part of the BPL until 2025.\n\nThe tournament, which had shrunk to six teams last year, has expanded back to its usual seven now and there is a new owner in the mix. A company called Future Sports Bangladesh Ltd took over the Sylhet team. There is a high-profile returnee as well with Bashundhara Group reacquiring the Rangpur franchise.\n\nFortune Barishal Sports Ltd kept hold of the Barishal team. Mindtree did the same with Khulna Tigers. Progoti Green Auto Rice Mills Ltd, who owned Sylhet last season, have taken on the Dhaka franchise this time. Minister Group had sponsored the side from the capital in 2022 after the BCB dismissed the original owners. Delta Sports Ltd retained control of the Chattogram franchise.\n\nThis means that five of the owners who were involved with BPL 8 earlier this year will stay on for BPL 9, 10 and 11.\n\n\"After detailed evaluation and assessment of the EOI documents submitted by prospective owners, the BPL (Bangladesh Premier League) T20 governing council has invited the parties to complete the process of securing franchise ownership rights for the next three editions of the tournament,\" the BCB said in a press release."
