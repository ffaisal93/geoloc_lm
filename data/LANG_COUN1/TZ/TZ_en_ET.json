an 80 per cent increase since the beginning of the conflict.\n\n‚ÄúMost of the population in Tigray must now survive on limited and nutritionally inadequate diets,‚Äù she said, adding that there had also been ‚Äúan increase in child marriages and child labour, human trafficking, and transactional sex as desperate means for survival‚Äù.\n\n¬© UNICEF/ Christine Nesbitt A child sits inside a vehicle burned out during fighting in the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia.\n\nTigrayan women and girls not spared\n\nAccording to the Commission chairperson, rape and crimes of sexual violence had happened ‚Äúon a staggering scale‚Äù since the earliest days of the conflict, ‚Äúwith Ethiopian and Eritrean forces and regional militias targeting Tigrayan women and girls with particular violence and brutality‚Äù.\n\nTigrayan forces had also committed rape and sexual violence against Amhara women and girls and Eritrean refugees, Ms. Murungi said, highlighting the devastating long-term impacts for the survivors that included trauma, unwanted pregnancy and HIV infection.\n\n‚ÄòUnfair and biased scrutiny‚Äô\n\nRejecting the report‚Äôs findings, the Ethiopia delegation repeated its claim that the federal government had been subjected to ‚Äúunfair and biased scrutiny‚Äù at the Council for more than a year.\n\nAddis Ababa was engaged in responding to an ‚Äúinsurrectionist armed group that has endangered the territorial integrity of the country‚Äù, the Council heard.\n\nThe international commission of human rights experts on Ethiopia was established after the Human Rights Council adopted resolution S-33/1 on 17 December 2021.\n\nIt mandated a panel of three human rights experts -

    "What Ethiopia and Tigray need for peace talks to succeed": "An impartial mediator, political will and a fraction of the world‚Äôs attention that Ukraine has received would help.\n\nOn August 24, 2022, the wheels fell off an uneasy nine-month truce between the Ethiopian and Tigrayan governments, with an enormous military assault across dozens of fronts in Tigray.\n\nThe informal cessation of hostilities had been reached following the withdrawal of Tigrayan forces from the neighbouring Afar and Amhara regions in December 2021. In the ensuing period, both parties called for mediation to end the war, as the humanitarian situation in northern Ethiopia deteriorated.\n\nMediation efforts by the United States to revive the ceasefire in early September failed. The deadly war on Tigray ‚Äì which has killed more than half a million people, left more than 5.6 million Tigrayans starving and displaced another two million ‚Äì has flared up again. In some ways, the signs have been ominous for a while: The government in Addis Ababa had, at the start of August, refused to lift the siege on Tigray and had criticised a joint visit by envoys of the United Nations, US, and European Union to the region‚Äôs capital Mekelle.\n\nStill, a new window of opportunity for peace has emerged ‚Äî if the parties to the conflict and bodies like the UN, which is currently meeting in New York, can utilise it urgently.\n\nOn September 11, 2022 ‚Äì the Ethiopian New Year ‚Äì the government of Tigray expressed its readiness to resume negotiations brokered by the African Union, effectively putting the ball in Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed‚Äôs court. Now, proactive mediation is needed to stop the entire region from being sucked into a greater abyss, save tens of thousands of lives and alleviate the suffering of millions.\n\nNegotiations between the governments of Ethiopia and Tigray will determine the future of both the region and the country. In the Horn of Africa, 66 million people are already affected by drought. The stakes for the international community are very high. What then can be done to revive the truce and build a permanent ceasefire? What needs to be done to ensure successful mediation?\n\nUnderstanding military realities\n\nOn one side of the war are Ethiopian, Amhara and Eritrean forces marshalling the resources of a population of more than 120 million with two sovereign states and their foreign allies providing military-grade drones. On the other side are the Tigray Defense Forces (TDF) representing the popular resistance of the fewer than eight million people of Tigray. Their war of attrition will reach the two-year mark on November 4, 2022.\n\nThe success of mediation efforts heavily depends on the military realities on the ground, the political will of the warring parties and the determination of the international community to end the war ‚Äì as demonstrated by the diplomatic, financial, and other resources it deploys.\n\nFurthermore, the success of mediation also depends on the mediators and their strategies. That in turn will determine the process, structure and agenda for talks, how different issues at stake are prioritised and other key ingredients for negotiations. In this instance, the AU, as the lead mediator in consultation with other envoys, has yet to develop a clear strategy. That could be dangerous because discredited mediation leaves conflicts even more convoluted than before and reduces trust in the utility of such efforts.\n\nImpartial mediator needed\n\nFollowing the reservations expressed by Tigray over the current African Union (AU) envoy, former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, it is imperative that the organisation appoint other mediators acceptable to both parties.\n\nImpartiality is the cornerstone of proactive mediation. Former Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, who has been engaging both parties, was appointed by his successor, William Ruto, to serve as his country‚Äôs envoy for Ethiopia and the Great Lakes. The US, EU and others have endorsed Kenyatta‚Äôs appointment. The AU should consider swiftly appointing Kenyatta as its envoy to Ethiopia too, while Obasanjo remains the envoy for the Horn.\n\nCrucial next steps\n\nTo achieve military disengagement, it is critical to cease hostilities. This will allow a return to peaceful negotiations towards a ceasefire and transitional security arrangement. Unlike a mere truce, a ceasefire requires an overall agreement on the political agenda for the items of peace negotiations.\n\nThat agenda must include confidence-building measures, including unimpeded access to humanitarian aid and the immediate resumption of civilian transportation, electricity, telecommunications, banking services, salary payments, fuel deliveries and other items critical to survival for millions in Tigray. These are prerequisites for negotiations. Another confidence-building measure would be the release of prisoners of war and political prisoners, including Tigrayan members of the Ethiopian army and security sector.\n\nTo commence the process and prepare the ground for substantive and intricate politico-military negotiations, a Declaration of Principles ‚Äì laying out parameters for the talks ‚Äì should be made to guide the mediation process.\n\nNone of this will be easy. There are several thorny issues involved. They include demands from Tigray for the withdrawal of all non-TDF forces from all territories of the region, in effect returning to pre-war military positions. Ethiopia needs to recognise the TDF as the sole provider of security for Tigray and respect the will of the region‚Äôs people, including their right to hold a referendum within an agreed-upon time frame. Finally, there needs to be legal accountability before an international tribunal for atrocities established by the recent report of the International Commission of Human Rights Experts (ICHRE) on Ethiopia.\n\nInternational community involvement\n\nFinding agreement on these issues and bridging differences in a way that is anchored in respect for human rights will require unified international support for the mediation.\n\nEffective mediation, in turn, needs robust and coercive compliance mechanisms and enforcement measures against violators, including provisions for sanctions on selected individuals, regional travel bans, freezing of assets and exclusion from political office in future governance arrangements.\n\nThe war on Tigray resumed partly due to the failure of the pan-African and international community to take concrete measures to end Ethiopia‚Äôs siege of the region. The Ukraine war has deflected the international community‚Äôs resources, leadership and attention away from the catastrophic war in Ethiopia ‚Äî and laid bare some glaring double standards.\n\nAfter all, in terms of magnitude and the humanitarian consequences, the conflict in Ukraine ‚Äî while horrific ‚Äî pales in comparison to the ongoing battles of attrition in Tigray, which have already claimed more than 500,000 lives.\n\nThe UN Security Council and the UN General Assembly must urgently discuss the situation in Ethiopia and deliberate on the report of the International Commission of Human Rights Experts on Ethiopia, submitted to the Human Rights Council in Geneva this week.\n\nJust a tiny fraction of what the Western world has so far spent in support of Ukraine‚Äôs resistance against Russia‚Äôs invasion could have stopped the war in the Horn of Africa, ending the suffering of hundreds of millions.\n\nFor peace to truly take hold in the region, the world needs to wake up. Now.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author‚Äôs own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera‚Äôs editorial stance.",

    "U.S. Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa Hammer‚Äôs Work in Ethiopia": "Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa (SEHOA) Mike Hammer arrived in Ethiopia on September 5 to encourage efforts for an immediate stop to the fighting and participation by the government of Ethiopia and the Tigrayan regional authorities in African Union-led peace talks. Special Envoy Hammer met with Ethiopian government officials, AU representatives, and international partners on next steps forward, and returned to Washington September 16. He will continue diplomatic efforts on the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York during high-level week beginning September 19.\n\nDuring his visit to Ethiopia, Special Envoy Hammer met with the AU‚Äôs High Representative Olusegun Obasanjo on several occasions to discuss how the United States can partner to support the peace process. In addition, SEHOA Hammer met with his counterparts the UN Special Representative to the Secretary General Hanna Tetteh and EU SEHOA Annette Weber, as well as other international partners. Meanwhile, Assistant Secretary Molly Phee, who attended the inauguration of Kenyan President Ruto in Nairobi, also advanced these diplomatic efforts aimed at getting AU-led talks launched in pursuit of peace. The United States welcomes the Government of Ethiopia‚Äôs restatement of its continued readiness to participate in talks, as well as the September 11 statement by Tigrayan regional authorities accepting an AU-led process, including by naming its delegation. Based on these commitments, the United States seeks tangible follow through from all parties to the conflict to enter into negotiations in good faith.\n\nSpecial Envoy Hammer and Charg√© d‚ÄôAffaires ad interim Tracey Ann Jacobson at the U.S. Embassy in Addis Ababa also met with Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and with Deputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister Demeke Mekonnen to discuss U.S. concerns about the renewed fighting in the north of Ethiopia and Eritrea‚Äôs re-entry into the conflict as well as the urgent need to redouble efforts to begin AU-led talks aimed at bringing a permanent end to the conflict. During his meetings with Ethiopian government officials as well as with Tigrayan regional authorities Special Envoy Hammer reiterated the need for unhindered humanitarian access in the Tigray, Afar, and Amhara regions, stressed the need to respect human rights and avoid civilian casualties, raised ongoing reports of ethnically-based detentions, and pressed for accountability for those responsible for atrocities and justice for the victims and survivors.\n\nFinally, he met with AU Commission Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat, Minister of Justice Dr. Gedion Timothewos, and National Security Advisor Redwan Hussein. The United States is committed to the unity, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Ethiopia and seeks peace and stability for the benefit of all Ethiopians. Special Envoy Hammer received briefings on the ongoing severe drought in eastern and southern Ethiopia, including delivery of humanitarian assistance as the United States continues to be the largest donor of humanitarian assistance to Ethiopia.",

    "Al-Shabaab‚Äôs Attack in Ethiopia: One-off Incursion or Persistent Threat?": "Al-Shabaab‚Äôs Attack in Ethiopia: One-off Incursion or Persistent Threat?\n\nEthiopian forces in July contained and repulsed an attack conducted in the eastern part of the country by Somalia-based al-Shabaab. Fighters from the militant group entered from southwestern Somalia and targeted four border towns in Ethiopia‚Äôs Somali regional state known as Ogaden Region. The estimated 500 al-Shabaab fighters had moved 150 kilometers inside Ethiopia before being met by the Ethiopian military and retreating (Garowe Online, July 30).\n\nAfter several days of fighting, the Ethiopian military claimed it killed as many as 800 militants, including Fuad Mohammad Khalaf, who is also know as Fuad Shangole and was a senior al-Shabaab leader. The U.S designated Shangole as a foreign terrorist in 2010 and placed a $5 million bounty on his head in 2012 (People Dispatch, August 1). Al-Shabaab, however, later denied the Ethiopian claims about the death totals and asserted it had killed at least 100 Ethiopian servicemen, including policemen, before taking control of the town of Aoto (Sudan Tribune, August 7).\n\nThe attack came as surprise since al-Shabaab had not launched cross-border attacks into Ethiopia in years. However, the group has frequently targeted the nearly 4,000 Ethiopian troops operating in Somalia under the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS), which was formerly known as the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM). On August 21, Somali security forces, which are backed by ATMIS, for example, fought off a 30-hour al-Shabaab attack on Hotel Hayat in Mogadishu, which left at least 21 people dead. The attack was the first major attack since Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohammud took office in May (Nation, August 22).\n\nA More Confident and Expansionist Al-Shabaab\n\nThe attempt by al-Shabaab to spread to Ethiopia appears to have been thwarted by Ethiopian forces, but the attack underlines a resurgent, more confident, and strengthened al-Shabaab. Despite the group losing key territories to ATMIS forces and some of its top leaders in U.S airstrikes, such as Aden Hashi Farah ‚ÄúAyro‚Äù in 2008 and Moktar Ali Zubeyr in 2014, the group continues to show resilience after each setback, always launching fresh attacks. It has also carried out continuous recruitment campaigns throughout the East Africa region (Garowe Online, January 1).\n\nAt the same time, the current political circumstances in Ethiopia create favorable ground for the militant group‚Äôs continued attacks. Ethiopia‚Äôs security forces have been struggling with internal unrest since the launch of the military operation in the northern state of Tigray in November 2020 (Terrorism Monitor, December 7, 2021). As the conflict persists, it is likely that al-Shabaab will take advantage of the turmoil to launch more cross-border attacks (Africa News, August 5).\n\nAdditionally, the push into Ethiopia can be seen as part of al-Shabaab leaders‚Äô attempts to expand the conflict beyond Somalia. The vision was first articulated by the late Shaykh Ahmed Abdi Godane, who was the group‚Äôs emir and was killed in a U.S. airstrike in 2014 (aljazeera.com, September 6, 2014). Less than a year before the attacks in Ethiopia, Ahmed Diriye, who is al-Shabaab‚Äôs current emir, appeared to restate Godane‚Äôs vision. He called for external attacks beyond Somalia with emphasis on American and French interests, especially in Djibouti (African News, March 29, 2021).\n\nNorthern Kenya Under Threat From a Financially Emboldened Al-Shabaab\n\nApart from the attack in Ethiopia, al-Shabaab has persistently attacked parts of the northern and coastal regions of Kenya. In one of the latest attacks, five policemen were injured in Mandera in northern Kenya after suspected al-Shabaab fighters ambushed them while they were on patrol. In January, six people were also killed in Lamu in another attack by suspected members of al-Shabaab (The Star, January 3).\n\nMoreover, while controlling large swathes of territory in southern Somalia, the group has also outpaced the government in revenue collection. This provides al-Shabaab with the financial muscle it needs to further expand the insurgency (Somali Guardian, February 22). As a result, al-Shabaab has been strengthening its arsenal by spending a reported US$24 million out of its annual budget of US$180 million on arms purchases. The money is raised through taxation at checkpoints in Somalia or persuading or coercing the local population into paying tax (Hiraal Institute, October 2020).\n\nBesides purchasing guns, ammunition, explosives and other heavy weapons, the manufacture of explosives and some ammunition also comprises part of al-Shabaab‚Äôs budget. The weapons are being obtained from the local black market and international sources, with Yemen as a key exporter. Other weapons are also seized in battles with the Somali national army and ATMIS troops (Africa News, February 22).\n\nConclusion\n\nAl-Shabaab‚Äôs attempt to spread to Ethiopia appears to have been contained, but this was not a one‚Äìoff attack and more attacks should be anticipated in the near future. At the same time, the current political circumstances in Ethiopia are creating fertile ground for the militant group‚Äôs attacks. The resolution of the Tigray crisis is paramount if any further spread of al-Shabaab into Ethiopia is to be stopped.",
    "S. Sudan, Ethiopia agree on joint project to link with Djibouti port": "By Tesfa-Alem Tekle\n\nSeptember 23, 2022 (NAIROBI) ‚Äì Ethiopia and South Sudan have agreed to carry out a series of joint infrastructure projects that would eventually enable the latter to link with the port of Djibouti.\n\nThe agreement was reached on Tuesday after a high-level South Sudan delegation led by Vice-President, Taban Geng Gai, met with a group of Ethiopian Ministers led by Finance Minister, Ahmed Shide.\n\nEarlier, the two sides discussed ways how to enhance joint infrastructure connectivity projects.\n\nIn this regard, both sides agreed on ways to enhance their previously designed plans in the areas of road infrastructure, energy, telecommunications, water transportation, and other vital economic sectors with a view to creating integration for mutual benefits.\n\nPer the newly reached agreement, one of the key projects being prioritized was to undertake road projects with a view to boosting connectivity between the two landlocked countries.\n\nAfter the discussions, Ethiopia‚Äôs Finance Minister, Ahmed Shide, confirmed that the two sides have concluded a very important agreement in terms of advancing two road projects.\n\n‚ÄúWe comprehensively agreed to work on joint infrastructural connectivity that will overcome geographical barriers in terms of trade and logistics flows between our two countries and people-to-people relations.‚Äù\n\nCut reliance on Kenya‚Äôs port\n\nThe fresh agreement with Ethiopia comes only a few days after South Sudan announced buying three acres of land at the port of Djibouti for the construction of a facility to handle its import and export of goods as the landlocked country eyes an alternative route to cut high dependency on Kenya‚Äôs Mombasa port.\n\n‚ÄúWe have only been using Port Sudan and Mombasa but recently, we have decided to go to Djibouti and as I am speaking to you, we have landed in Djibouti,‚Äù South Sudan Minister for Petroleum Puot Kang Chol is quoted as saying by local media.\n\nThe minister said the land was procured by the Ministry of Petroleum for the purpose of exporting the country‚Äôs crude oil as well as using it on imported goods. If effected, the move will hit the port of Mombasa given that Juba is one of Kenya‚Äôs largest clients importing nearly all of its cargo through the Kenyan port. Rising costs Khartoum charges Juba for pipelines have also pushed South Sudan to eye alternative routes to export its crude oil to the international market.\n\nPort of Djibouti\n\nThe road projects will be given top priority to open up transportation so that connectivity of South Sudan will be enhanced via Ethiopia through the Djibouti corridor, the Ethiopian minister added.\n\n‚ÄúThese projects will be financed jointly and we have agreed to finalize the feasibility and preparations in terms of selecting a contractor so that the joint financing mechanism will be worked upon,‚Äù Shide said. The South Sudanese delegation, on its part, vowed to cooperate and work for the immediate implementation of the joint projects.\n\n‚ÄúThe agreed projects will be operationalized and put into consideration as soon as all the technical aspects are addressed,‚Äù said Michael Makuei Lueth, South Sudan‚Äôs Information minister said on behalf of the delegation.\n\nLueth said that it is worth mentioning that South Sudan, as a landlocked country, will benefit from the port of Djibouti using Ethiopia as a transport hub. ‚ÄúTrade can be facilitated by Ethiopia through the Djibouti corridor,‚Äù he said adding ‚ÄúWe expect Ethiopia to support us so that we can grow and be as strong as Ethiopia is today.‚Äù the South Sudanese minister added.\n\nIn transport connectivity, river, fibre optics and transmission line connectivity has been agreed upon and the preparation to realize the agreement will commence right after this meeting, Ethiopian officials said. ‚ÄúAs soon as the preparations are completed we will work together for resource mobilization and reaching out to development financial institutions as part of the Horn of Africa initiative‚Äù Shide added. Aviation Sector The two sides have also agreed to work on the aviation sector. ‚ÄúEthiopia has massive experience in airport construction. With this capacity, we have also agreed to share our experience and work on a joint mechanism on aviation connectivity and development with the republic of South Sudan.‚Äù the Ethiopian Finance Minister told journalists. Peace Process Ethiopia will continue to work and support the peace process in South Sudan, the minister said. He noted that ensuring regional peace and stability are crucial for the two countries‚Äô joint infrastructural development. ‚ÄúWe have a very comprehensive political commitment and will to advance the cooperation between the two countries,‚Äù Shide added. The South Sudanese high-level delegation arrived in Addis Ababa on Wednesday for a three-day official working visit. Upon arrival at Addis Ababa Bole International Airport, the South Sudanese delegation was warmly received by Ethiopian Defense Minister Abraham Belay and Director General of African Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Fisseha Shawul, among other senior government officials.",
    "A Wounded Ethiopia": "Last month, Ethiopia‚Äôs Tigray conflict resumed after months of truce, once again bringing desperately-need humanitarian aid flows to a halt and drawing in neighboring Eritrea‚Äôs armed forces. The return of outright hostilities in Tigray has prompted more intense international efforts to get a peace process on track, including the deployment of U.S. Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa Mike Hammer to the region for intensive talks with the parties to the conflict. External actors who desire stability in the Horn recognize that neither of the main antagonists can decisively defeat the other.\n\nThe setback in Tigray came in the context of escalating civil conflict in multiple parts of the Ethiopian state, from Afar and Oromia to Benishangul Gumuz and Gambella. Questions about the capacity of the Ethiopian government to provide security throughout the country have grown more urgent. An incident in July in which al-Shabab fighters crossed into Ethiopia from Somalia to stage attacks, suggests that they perceived Ethiopia to be both weakened and distracted. It‚Äôs difficult not to get a sense that the government in Addis Ababa, which has little economic room to maneuver, has no real long-term strategy for coping with these multiplying crises.\n\nIronically, Prime Minister Abiy initially rallied domestic and diaspora support for his scorched-earth tactics in Tigray by framing the conflict as one in which Ethiopia‚Äôs sovereignty and right to self-determination was a stake. But as his government becomes overwhelmed by security and economic struggles on multiple fronts, it becomes an ever-more appealing target for international opportunists of all stripes, from organizations like al-Shabab to governments that can offer some short-term relief in the form of economic support and weapons, even as they build long-term leverage and influence. In the geostrategically vital Horn of Africa, Ethiopia has gone from a power that shaped the contours of regional dynamics to a state cobbling together reactions to the forces affecting it. The outcome is precisely the opposite of the one that Ethiopian nationalists seek. If the state can avoid collapse, it may be far more beholden to outsiders than just two years ago.\n\nAfrica in Transition Michelle Gavin and other experts track political and security developments across sub-Saharan Africa.

Instead, the Horn of Africa grows more unstable, malign actors like Eritrea are emboldened, and the horrifying human costs of a manmade famine in Tigray lay bare the international system‚Äôs dysfunction. In the face of fierce Ethiopian resistance to UN Security Council involvement, the supposed guarantors of international peace and security have been unable to meaningfully address the Tigray issue, despite its interstate dimensions and collective international efforts to place humanitarian siege strategies beyond the pale of acceptability globally.\n\nA ray of hope emerged on Sunday, when Tigrayan forces indicated they were prepared to enter into a mutual cessation of hostilities agreement and participate in African Union-led talks without delay. This announcement creates a new opportunity to build positive momentum toward an end to the Tigray crisis. Whether real progress toward lasting peace will materialize remains to be seen, but what is not in doubt is just how difficult the outlook for Ethiopia will be without it.",

    "Deadly Diseases Rise as War Limits Vaccinations in Ethiopia": "Deadly diseases like measles, tetanus and whooping cough are on the rise in Ethiopia‚Äôs Tigray area. Vaccination rates have fallen sharply there during the almost two-year-long civil war.\n\nThe percentage of children receiving usual vaccinations has fallen below 10 percent this year, data from the Tigray Health Bureau shows. That has undone years of government efforts to increase vaccination rates.\n\n\"The hopes of the children in the region to grow healthier and happier were snatched away in the blink of an eye,\" the agency wrote in a letter this month to the international vaccine group Gavi.\n\nThe letter said attacks on Tigray by Ethiopian government forces led to supply shortages that reduced the number of vaccinations. The Tigray agency also wrote that power outages have disrupted vaccine supply chains. The agency added that it is difficult for people in rural areas to get to health centers.\n\nA ceasefire from March to late August made it possible for foreign medical aid to enter the area. But humanitarian access has been suspended since fighting began again, U.N. human rights experts said Monday.\n\nThe experts said in a report that they had reason to believe that the denial of access to healthcare and other aid by federal officials is a crime against humanity.\n\nEthiopian government officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the U.N. report.\n\nThe government has denied blocking aid and says the Tigray People‚Äôs Liberation Front (TPLF), the party leading the area government, is responsible for the conflict. The fighting has killed thousands of civilians in Tigray.\n\nMeasles outbreaks\n\nHealth Minister Lia Tadesse said vaccines had been provided to Tigray this year. She said that more were ready to be provided once conditions improved.\n\nIn its letter, the Tigray Health Bureau said the percentage of children receiving the full dosage of vaccines had dropped to very low levels.\n\nVaccination rates against several diseases including whooping cough, tetanus, and hepatitis B dropped from 99.3 percent in 2020 to 36 percent in 2021. This year, the vaccination rate is seven percent.\n\nThe rate across Ethiopia was 65 percent in 2021, said the U.N. children's agency UNICEF.\n\nThe letter also reports a drop in percentages of children being vaccinated against tuberculosis and measles. The vaccination rate was above 90 percent in 2020 and is below 10 percent this year.\n\nThe letter said measles have spread in 10 of Tigray‚Äôs 35 districts since the war began.\n\nThe nonprofit organization Gavi pays for and ships vaccines to developing countries. It said it had provided measles and COVID-19 vaccines during the ceasefire in Tigray, but that some activities had been suspended since fighting began again.\n\nEthiopia's Lia said 860,000 doses of measles vaccines were sent to Tigray last December and more doses were provided on April 2. And she said the U.N. World Food Program (WFP) is delaying a planned transport of humanitarian aid into Tigray.\n\nBut WFP spokesperson Claire Nevill said the agency was waiting on approval from Ethiopia‚Äôs government.\n\nWithout the clearances, she said, ‚Äúlifesaving humanitarian supplies, including food, nutrition and medical items, will have to be on hold.‚Äù\n\nI‚Äôm Dan Novak.\n\nDan Novak adapted this story for VOA Learning English based on reporting by Reuters.\n\n____________________________________________________________________\n\nWords in This Story\n\nregion ‚Äî n. a part of a country, of the world, etc., that is different or separate from other parts in some way\n\nsnatch ‚Äî v. to take (something) quickly or eagerly\n\nin the blink of an eye ‚Äî n. very quickly\n\ndisrupt ‚Äî v. to cause something to be unable to continue in the normal way\n\naccess ‚Äî n. a way of getting near, at, or to something or someone\n\ndose ‚Äî n. the amount of a medicine, drug, or vitamin that is taken at one time\n\ndistrict ‚Äî n. an area established by a government for official government business\n\nclearance ‚Äî n. an official decision saying that someone has permission to do something\n\nnutrition ‚Äî n. the process of eating the right kind of food so you can grow properly and be healthy",
    "Daily Noon Briefing Highlights: Ethiopia": "17 July 2022. Kori Town, Afar Region. Women and children stand in their community in drought-affected Kori Town. (Credit: Liz Loh-Taylor for OCHA Ethiopia)\n\nDaily Noon Briefing Highlights - 23 September 2022\n\nEthiopia\n\nIn Ethiopia, our humanitarian colleagues tell us that hostilities continue with reported displacement of hundreds of thousands of people in parts of Tigray, Afar and Amhara regions in the last few weeks.\n\nLarge parts of Tigray and several areas in Amhara and Afar are now inaccessible to humanitarians due the reported fighting.\n\nHumanitarian convoys via the only available land route into Tigray remain suspended. UN Humanitarian Air Service flights to and from Tigray are also suspended since 25 August, halting the transport of high value commodities and operational cash into Tigray.\n\nWe along with our partners continue to respond with available stocks in accessible areas across the three regions, but it is not enough to meet the increasing needs.\n\nIn Tigray, 1.4 million people were assisted with food in the beginning of this month, bringing the total to more than 2.1 million out of the 5.4 million people targeted since the start of August.\n\nIn Amhara, humanitarian partners assisted displaced people with food, including more than 30,000 people at Jarra site.

    "Ethiopia - Situation Report, 19 Sep 2022 - Ethiopia": "HIGHLIGHTS\n\n6,037 internally displaced people assisted to voluntarily relocate from Semera to Ab‚Äôala. Semera displacement site has been effectively closed on 5 September;\n\nDespite renewed hostilities, humanitarian response has continued in accessible areas with the available stocks in Afar, Amhara and Tigray regions;\n\nMore than 59,000 people are reportedly displaced by floods in Afar Region and require assistance;\n\nMore than 16 million people in drought affected areas require multisectoral assistance at least until the end of the year, and beyond.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nSituation Overview\n\nMultiple man-made and natural crisis across different regions of Ethiopia continue to drive high humanitarian needs. As indicated in the 2022 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP), more than 20 million people will require humanitarian assistance and protection services until the end of 2022. The mid-year review of the 2022 HRP is being finalized and will also incorporate the recently released Drought Response Plan (1).\n\nFollowing the resumption of hostilities some three weeks ago, after a five-month generally calm situation in northern Ethiopia, the displacement of tens of thousands of people has been reported in parts of Afar, Amhara and Tigray regions. The situation continues to create higher humanitarian needs and further stretch the limited response capacity of humanitarian partners striving to deliver assistance to people in need.\n\nIn Afar Region, 6,037 IDPs have voluntarily relocated from Semera to Ab'ala, and the Semera IDP site has been effectively closed on 5 September.The relocation process had started on 16 August. Humanitarian partners continue to provide assistance to those relocated in their current location, including supporting health services and water infrastructure in Ab'ala. Voluntary relocation from another site in Semera and of internally displaced persons (IDPs) residing with the host community will be conducted once preparations are completed and if security situation permits.\n\nMeanwhile, new displacements continue to be reported due to the ongoing hostilities in Afar Region. Displacements are also being reported due to floods, withmore than 59,000 people reportedly displaced in Asayita, Afambo, Dubti and Mille in Zone 1 and Gewane, Gelalo, Amibara, Hanruka, Buremudaytu, Awash Fentale and Dulecha Woredas in Zone 3. Additional areas are at risk of floods. Some of the newly displaced people have received food, emergency shelter and non-food items assistance, albeit still very limited compared to the high needs. At the same time, some flood-affected areas remain temporarily inaccessible.\n\nIn Amhara Region, the hostilities are affecting communities in North Gondar, North Wollo and Wag Hemra zones among others. Debark in North Gondar, Kobo and Woldiya in North Wollo as well as Abergele and Sekota in Wag Hemra remain hard-to-reach for humanitarian operators due to the volatile security situation. Destruction of property and of civilian infrastructure has also been reported. In North Wollo Zone, Jara IDP site was reportedly looted and part of the existing infrastructure damaged or destroyed. On 30 August 2022, more than 30,000 IDPs who were sheltering in the site had left looking for safety as news spread about fighting reportedly nearing Woldiya City, which is located some 50 kilometers from Jara. Most of the IDPs have now returned to the damaged site where the Government and humanitarian partners have resumed the provision of food and water trucking services. Lack of fuel and intermittent access challenges, however, are limiting the response efforts.\n\nRegional authorities have recently set up six collective sites in Mersa Town in North Wollo Zone on 6 September to accommodate increased number of IDPs. At least 12,000 newly displaced people, mainly women and children, are taking refuge in the town. Following the findings of a recent interagency needs assessment mission to Mersa Town, partners are mobilizing food and non-food items for distribution to assist them. A mobile health and nutrition team has already been dispatched to the town.\n\nThe overall food security level is concerning with at least 5 million people considered food insecure in Amhara. The situation is particularly dire in conflict-affected areas in the region. Malnutrition levels in more than 80 per cent of these areas are high. The most recent Government nutrition hotspot classification published in March 2022 revealed 125 hotspot woredas across the region, of which 74 are Priority One for response. Blanket and targeted supplementary feeding as well as school feeding programs are ongoing, but due to resources' constraints, partners can target only 83 per cent of the targeted food-insecure people, including some only receiving an incomplete food basket (limited to wheat).\n\nFlooding has also been reported in several flood-prone areas in Amhara Region, including in North Gondar, South Gondar and West Gojam zones. The Regional Flood Contingency Plan estimates that more than 487,000 people will be affected, of which more than 29,000 are likely to be displaced across 32 woredas in seven zones. Food response is ongoing but with severe limitations due to resource constraints.\n\nSimilarly, in Tigray Region, hostilities continued to be reported in several parts with tens of thousands of people reportedly displaced and civilian property and infrastructure damaged. New conflict-induced displacements are expected around Adigrat, Mai Tsebri and Sheraro. Movements of humanitarian convoy along the Semera - Mekelle route remains suspended since 24 August, hindering the transportation of humanitarian supplies. The United Nations Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) flights, which had been flying between Addis Ababa and Mekelle twice per week and had recently announced the organization of a third weekly flight, also remains suspended since 26 August, hampering the rotation of humanitarian workers and the transfer of cash for humanitarian operations. Nevertheless, the distribution of humanitarian assistance continues in accessible areas in Tigray with the remaining available stocks in the region, including supporting health centers and hospitals medical supplies and cold chain equipment (freezers and refrigerators). Partners have also mobilized shelter supplies for 23,000 newly displaced households in Shire and Mekelle towns, while preparations are underway to receive new IDPs in Sebacare IDP site in Mekelle and Mai Dimu site in Shire.\n\nHostilities in parts of western, southern, and eastern Ethiopia also continue to drive humanitarian needs. Hostilities in western Oromia, particularly in the Wollega zones, have also led to an influx of displacement across the Wollega zones and into Amhara Region, particularly to Debre Birhan Town in North Shewa Zone. The latest insecurity in Somali Region continues to impede the drought response, particularly in parts of Afder and Shabelle zones, as well as partially in Liben Zone. Meanwhile in Siti Zone, people displaced by violence in recent months are receiving assistance. The displaced population is sheltering in Aydhidhi, Bediwayn, Caska and Garba sites. An inter-agency mission will be monitoring the ongoing response to gauge new needs as well as identify gaps.\n\nIn eastern and southeastern Ethiopia, the Government and humanitarian partners continue to mobilize resources to scale-up multi-sector lifesaving assistance to close to 17 million people living in drought-affected areas, but the needs still surpass ongoing response, where the drought continues to impact several essential and critical sectors. In addition to deepening food insecurity and rising malnutrition, school dropouts and protection risks are rife. At present, around 9.9 million people require food assistance, and 2.9 million children and pregnant and breastfeeding women require nutrition interventions until the end of the year. The education of 1.4 million children has also been disrupted due to drought-induced migration, school closure or communicable diseases. The health impacts of the drought are also rising, including measles and diarrheal cases.\n\nIn Somali Region,for example, the number of dysentery/diarrheal cases have shown an increasing trend in recent weeks, particularly in Afder, Dawa, Fafan and Shabelle zones. Overall, the number of diarrheal cases in the region has increased by 33 per cent compared to the same period last year. The Government and partners are implementing prevention and control measures, including increasing access to safe drinking water and sanitation, provision of drugs and overall support to health facilities. Overall, 11 million people in drought affected areas require health interventions until the end of the year. In SNNPR, even if water availability has improved following the good rains received during the summer/*Kiremt (*June-September) rainy season, water trucking support needs to continue in the chronically water-insecure areas such as Benatsemay, Dasenech, Gangatom and Hamer woredas of South Omo Zone; Wera Dijo *Woreda *of Halaba Zone, and Dugna Fango Woreda of Wolayita Zone.\n\nThe humanitarian situation is expected to deteriorate further in parts of drought affected areas with the reported fifth consecutive failed Deyr/Hageyarainy season (October -- December), according to most recent forecasts. The extent of the drought impact is captured in the revised Drought Response Plan (1) published on 8 September. This plan will serve to organize and monitor the drought response until the end of 2022.\n\nFootnotes\n\n1. Find link to the Drought Response Plan here: https://bit.ly/3S5zzYf",
    "Eritrea Calls Up Armed Forces After Ethiopia Clashes": "Eritrean authorities have called on their armed forces to mobilize in response to the renewed fighting in northern Ethiopia, the British and Canadian governments said.\n\nThe return to combat last month shattered a March truce and dashed hopes of peacefully resolving the nearly two-year war between Ethiopian authorities and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF).\n\nTigrayan authorities have since expressed readiness to hold talks led by the African Union, but the Ethiopian government has not responded publicly to the overtures, other than saying it remains \"committed\" to the AU-led peace process.\n\nBoth sides have accused the other of firing first, and fighting has spread from around southern Tigray to other fronts farther north and west, while also drawing in Eritrean troops who backed Ethiopian forces during the early phase of the war.\n\nIn travel advisories published late Friday, the Canadian and British governments warned their nationals in Eritrea to limit their movements following the mobilization call.\n\n\"Local authorities have issued a general call for mobilization of armed forces in response to the conflict in northern Ethiopia,\" the Canadian government said.\n\n\"Additional security measures could be imposed on short notice across the country,\" it said.\n\nThe British advisory said the Eritrean announcement was made on Wednesday.\n\n\"You should be extra vigilant at this time,\" the advisory said.\n\nEritrea, which is one of the world's most closed states, has not commented on the reports.\n\nSince the latest clashes broke out, Tigray has been bombed several times, with an official at Ayder Referral Hospital, the region's biggest, saying that 16 people had died in air strikes.\n\nAFP was not able to independently verify the claims. Access to northern Ethiopia is severely restricted and Tigray has been under a communications blackout for more than a year.\n\nThe TPLF ruled Ethiopia for decades before Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed took office in 2018.\n\nAbiy's government has declared the TPLF a terrorist group and considers its claim to authority in Tigray illegitimate.\n\nAbiy -- a Nobel Peace Prize laureate -- sent troops into Tigray in November 2020 to topple the TPLF, in response to what he said were attacks on federal army camps.\n\nBut the TPLF recaptured most of Tigray in a surprise comeback in June 2021.\n\nIt then expanded into the neighboring regions of Afar and Amhara before the fighting reached a stalemate.",

    "Kenyan lenders can now buy up to 30pc stake in Ethiopia banks": "Equity Bank Headquarters at Upper Hill in Nairobi. [Wilberforce Okwiri, Standard]\n\nKenyan banks planning to enter Ethiopia through local joint ventures will be able buy only up to 30 per cent stake in Ethiopian banks.\n\nThis is after the Ethiopian government set the foreign holding cap in local banks for banking entities at 30 per cent, according to new details of the laws guiding the opening up of the local banking sector.\n\nThe cap is applicable for foreign lenders that want to acquire stakes in existing banks, according to an official spearheading the liberalisation process who was quoted by Ethiopian publication The Reporter on Saturday.\n\nAn additional five per cent stake will be allowed for foreign individuals and foreign non-bank investors each, taking the maximum stake a local bank can sell to foreigners at 40 per cent.\n\nKenyan banks are expected to line up to take advantage of an under-penetrated banking market in the horn of Africa country, buoyed by its huge population once the market fully opens.\n\nA law intended to accelerate foreign investment in the local banking sector is being finalised, though its implementation timelines are not clear yet.\n\nClear the way\n\nThe much awaited foreign investment law is expected to clear the way for Kenyan banks such as Equity, KCB and Co-operative Bank to set up operations in the Horn of Africa‚Äôs most populous nation.\n\nCo-operative Bank said earlier that it would prefer to enter the Ethiopian market through a joint venture with Ethiopia‚Äôs cooperative movement in a deal similar to its South Sudan business in which the government has a stake.\n\nThe bank said the entry would enable it to capitalise on Ethiopia‚Äôs fast-growing unbanked population.\n\nFormer KCB Group Chief Executive Joshua Oigara had earlier said that KCB would consider partnering with a local bank if Ethiopia‚Äôs economy were to be liberalised and foreign banks allowed to invest.\n\nAlternatively, he said, the bank could establish a standalone business.\n\nUnder the new investment law that is being firmed up, banks will have four options for Ethiopia entry.\n\nThey include opening local subsidiaries, buying stakes from local partners capped at 30 per cent, opening a branch or opening a representative office.\n\nIf foreign banks want to open a subsidiary on their own, there will be no cap, according to the new guidelines.\n\nEthiopia‚Äôs population of 110 million people ‚Äì the second-largest in Africa after Nigeria - offers significant business opportunities for Kenyan banks, the largest of which have embarked on a massive regional expansion in recent years.\n\nLess than 30 per cent of Ethiopians have access to a bank account, highlighting the opportunity for foreign lenders.\n\nAt present, Ethiopia has over 30 commercial lenders, two of which are State-owned, according to its Central Bank.\n\nKenyan banks have had their sights on the Ethiopian market for years due to the country‚Äôs huge population.\n\nKCB opened a representative office in Addis Ababa in 2015 as it readied to run full-fledged banking operations when the opportunity arises.\n\nRepresentative offices\n\nThis followed the 2012 deal that allowed Kenyan banks to open representative offices but barred full banking operations in Ethiopia, including direct lending and deposit-taking.\n\nThe lenders cannot generate deposits or lend directly to Ethiopian companies and households as such, but they can conduct research and credit assessments to allow lending from their headquarters in Kenya.\n\nKenyan banks have in the past decade aggressively opened subsidiaries in South Sudan, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, and Burundi to cut their reliance on the local market.\n\nThe local commercial banks are looking beyond Kenya‚Äôs borders for acquisitions, seeking to tap opportunities in East Africa which are driven by rapid economic growth and trade integration.\n\nA subsidiary is authorised to accept deposits from local individuals and businesses and advance loans to the same clientele.\n\nA direct local presence, therefore, allows banks to acquire more customers and expand their loan book in the foreign market. Equity opened a representative office in Addis Ababa in 2019.\n\nKCB Group recently entered an agreement to acquire 85 per cent stake in Trust Merchant Bank (TMB) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).\n\nIts entry into DRC take bring competition to the doorstep of its rival Equity Group, which in 2020 purchased a 66.5 per cent stake in Banque Commerciale Du Congo, entrenching its foothold in the hugely unbanked mineral-rich country.",

    "Ethiopians celebrate new year amid high inflation": "Renewed conflict in the north, crippling drought and stubbornly high inflation: Ethiopians rang in their new year on Sunday with little to celebrate.\n\nAt a livestock market in the capital Addis Ababa, traders and visitors alike bemoaned the various crises confronting Africa's second most populous nation.\n\n\"As you can see now, everything is expensive. If there was peace it wouldn't be like this,\" trader Endashew Denekew told AFP on Saturday, the eve of the new year holiday known as Enkutatash.\n\n\"The peace situation that you see and hear in different places is not good. People stayed at home and didn't come to the market and bring their livestock.\"\n\nFighting broke out last month between Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's forces and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), shattering a five-month truce that had raised hopes of a peaceful resolution to the nearly two-year war.\n\n\"The heightened level of conflict and fragility in Ethiopia is of great concern,\" the World Bank said in a gloomy report on Ethiopia published on September 8.\n\n\"Multiple conflicts combined with historic drought and other shocks have severely impacted millions of Ethiopians, jeopardizing the economic and social development progress the country has achieved in recent years.\"\n\nThe UN's emergency response OCHA earlier this month described the humanitarian situation in Ethiopia as \"dire\", with 20 million people nationwide in need of assistance because of conflict as well as climatic shocks such as prolonged drought and seasonal floods.\n\nWith a population of 115 million, Ethiopia has been one of the world's fastest-growing economies over the past 15 years, according to the World Bank. But like many has been hard hit by the Covid pandemic and the fallout from the war in Ukraine, as well as its own domestic woes.\n\nInflation in July was running at 33.5 percent, according to official data, with food inflation at 35.5 percent, deterring people from spending.\n\n\"There are not the usual crowds that you would see during the holiday market, like before,\" civil servant Chombe Gebrehana told AFP near the main open-air market in the capital.\n\n\"Inflation has had its impact. If people had enough money in their hands... we wouldn't see smaller crowds like this during the holiday market.\"\n\nIn a recent interview with the state-run Ethiopia News Agency, Abiy's senior policy adviser Mamo Mihretu acknowledged the cost of living crisis but said the government was taking measures to bring prices under control.\n\n\"Our effort is actually bearing fruit because inflation, if not completely addressed, is becoming stable right now,\" said Mamo, who is also head of the country's sovereign wealth fund.\n\nHe said the government was adopting reforms to attract investment and trade and forecast economic growth of six percent this year.\n\nMeanwhile, the renewed hostilities in the north have led to a new round of frantic diplomacy to try to end the conflict that first erupted in November 2020.\n\n\"May the parties in the conflict have the courage to choose talks over fighting, and participate in an African Union-led process that produces a lasting peace,\" the visiting US envoy for the Horn of Africa, Mike Hammer, said in a new year's message to Ethiopians.\n\nBack at the livestock market, metal worker Assefa Alemu says only a few people are buying.\n\n\"I used to buy (sheep) from 4,000 to 5,000 birr (about $75 to $95 at current exchange rates). But today it is 15,000 birr (about $285). Some people have less income, they can no longer afford this... the current situation is very difficult,\" he told AFP.\n\n\"I think if peace comes to the country, the prices will decrease.\"",

Since the establishment of diplomatic relations over half a century ago, no matter how the international landscape evolves, bilateral relations have always moved forward with sound and steady development. Mutual trust has kept deepening and pragmatic cooperation has been at the forefront of China-Africa cooperation. China highly appreciates Ethiopia's adherence to the one-China principle and its firm stand with China on issues concerning China's core interests. China will also continue to uphold justice on issues concerning Ethiopia's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. China attaches great importance to deepening and carrying forward mutual trust and friendship with Ethiopia and stands ready to make joint efforts to elevate the comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership between the two countries to new levels.\n\nDemeke Mekonnen Hassen expressed that he thanked Mr. Foreign Minister for his visit to Ethiopia last year at a time when Ethiopia was in difficulties. Ethiopia cherishes the deep and strong friendship with China, and is ready to strengthen the comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership and carry out all-round cooperation with China, and hopes that China will increase support for Ethiopia's personnel training. Ethiopia definitely agrees with the principle of non-interference in internal affairs and will continue to stand firmly with China.\n\nDemeke Mekonnen Hassen briefed on Ethiopia's commitment to advancing the peace talks on the northern conflict, and spoke highly of China's proposal on the \"Outlook on Peace and Development in the Horn of Africa\".\n\nWang Yi said, China appreciates Ethiopia's efforts for peace and supports Ethiopia in independently handling its own affairs. China will continue to provide assistance within its capacity to Ethiopia in dealing with temporary difficulties and jointly uphold the principle of non-interference in internal affairs. China appreciates Ethiopia's active support for the \"Outlook on Peace and Development in the Horn of Africa\" and supports Ethiopia's proposal for the institutionalization of the Horn of Africa Peace Conference. China is ready to maintain close communication with all parties to encourage regional countries to build common ground, independently handle regional affairs and advance the process of regional integration.",

However, he was told by Ethiopia‚Äôs Deputy Prime Minister Demeke Mekonnen that the country remains committed to African Union mediation of any peace talks.\n\nThe visit comes after fighting in the near two-year conflict between the Ethiopian federal government and rebels with the Tigray People‚Äôs Liberation Front (TPLF) resumed August 24, ending the five-month cease-fire.\n\nThe U.S. has condemned neighboring Eritrea's reentry into the conflict, an offensive by the TPLF, and airstrikes by the Ethiopian government, which hit civilian areas, including a kindergarten.\n\nBefore the fighting resumed peace talks looked possible, with the TPLF favoring mediation by the U.S. and Kenya‚Äôs government, while the Ethiopian government looked to the African Union to broker talks.\n\nWilliam Davison, an analyst with the International Crisis Group, a Belgium-based political analysis firm, said stability in Ethiopia is of great concern to the U.S.\n\n‚ÄúAbove and beyond the desire to bring about peace because of its intrinsic benefits to Ethiopia because of the devastation the conflict is causing,‚Äù Davison told VOA, ‚Äúthe U.S. is of course concerned about the regional and geopolitical implications of increasing instability in Ethiopia, a critical country in the Horn of Africa, which is an important strategic reason itself.‚Äù\n\nDavidson said Washington can‚Äôt force the parties to the negotiating table.\n\n‚ÄúAt this point the U.S. probably doesn‚Äôt have, immediately, any extra leverage to bring to bear,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOf course, it has the diplomatic access and can implore the parties to recommit to the truce and try and achieve talks, but for the moment, the momentum has moved away from any sort of punitive measures. They did establish a sanctions regime.‚Äù\n\nAmong some Ethiopians on social media, there have been accusations the U.S. is biased toward the TPLF.\n\nKiram Tadesse, a pro-government commentator, holds that point of view.\n\n‚ÄúThe United States and the so-called international community are not impartial and even defend the TPLF, whenever the federal forces and other allied forces launched their offensive against TPLF,‚Äù Tadesse said. ‚ÄúThere is a clear dissatisfaction among the social media users.‚Äù\n\nEthiopian state and state-controlled media also frequently parrot this view.\n\nVOA reached out to the TPLF and Ethiopian government with requests for comment on the arrival of the U.S. envoy, but neither responded.\n\nIn Tigray, humanitarian organizations say parts of the region are likely in a state of famine due to a lack of humanitarian aid being allowed in. The government has also shut down telecoms and banking there.\n\nWith clashes looking set to continue, it remains to be seen whether anyone can persuade the sides to open peace talks.",
    "Ethiopia, Eritrean forces launch joint offensive in Tigray": "Ethiopian and Eritrean forces on Thursday launched a massive \"joint\" offensive against areas of Tigray bordering Eritrea, say authorities in the rebel region in northern Ethiopia.\n\nEthiopia, \"after repositioning a massive military force in Eritrea, has now launched a joint offensive with the invading forces of Eritrea\" against northern Tigray, bordering Eritrea, the rebel forces' command announced in a statement.\n\nThe Ethiopian government and rebels in the Tigray region accused each other on Wednesday of opening new fronts in northern Ethiopia, a week after renewed fighting shattered a five-month truce.\n\nThe possible expansion of the conflict comes a day after a new air raid on the Tigrayan capital Mekele, the second since hostilities resumed on August 24, in areas of the Amhara and Afar regions surrounding the southeastern tip of Tigray.\n\nIn a statement issued on Wednesday morning, the Ethiopian government accused the rebels of having \"extended their offensive to other areas\" of northern Ethiopia, in the Wag administrative zone (northeastern Amhara), in Wolkait, a district of western Tigray, and in areas of western Amhara bordering Sudan.\n\nWhen asked by AFP, Getachew Reda, spokesman for the rebel authorities in Tigray, accused the \"Abiy regime\" of having \"launched an offensive in these areas\".\n\nNo confirmation of fighting in these areas could be obtained immediately from independent sources. Journalists do not have access to northern Ethiopia, making independent verification impossible, and telecommunications networks there operate randomly.\n\nClaimed by the Tigrayans and the Amhara - the country's second largest ethno-linguistic population - the West Tigray administrative zone has been occupied since the end of 2020 by the regional Amhara forces, which are assisting the federal army in the conflict.\n\nIn its statement, the Ethiopian government did not mention this new strike, which it neither confirmed nor denied.\n\nA humanitarian source who requested anonymity confirmed to AFP on Wednesday the night air strike on Mekele, without further details.\n\n- 18,000 displaced -\n\nThe rebel authorities in Tigray said in a statement that the raid had \"caused light to serious injuries to civilians and material damage\", without further details.\n\nAn earlier airstrike hit the town on August 26, killing at least four people, including two children, according to Dr. Kibrom, an official at Ayder Hospital, the main hospital in Mekele.\n\nThe rebels and UNICEF said a \"kindergarten\" had been hit, while the government said its aircraft only targeted \"military sites.\n\nMr. Getachew said overnight that the new \"night drone raid on Mekele\" was not aimed at any \"military target\" and accused Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed of \"killing children and innocent civilians.\n\nOn Tuesday, Getachew said the Tigrayan rebels, after initially \"defending (their) positions,\" had launched a counter-offensive across the southern border of Tigray.\n\nIn its statement, the government said the army had \"valiantly defended itself against attacks\" by the rebels \"in eastern Amhara.\n\nIn recent days, according to diplomatic, humanitarian and local sources, the rebels have advanced about 50 km into Amhara, approaching the town of Woldiya, as well as Afar.\n\nOn Tuesday, APDA, an NGO active in Afar, said it had already counted 18,000 people displaced by the resumption of fighting in the region and feared that their numbers would increase as the rebels \"advance\" towards Amhara.\n\n- Ready to negotiate -\n\nQuickly defeated in november 2020 by troops sent by Mr. Abiy to dislodge the executive of Tigray, which challenged his authority and which he accused of having attacked military bases, the tiger rebels took back almost the entire region in mid-2021, thanks to a counter-offensive that saw them approach Addis Ababa.\n\nThey then retreated to Tigray, accusing the government of \"laying siege\" to the region, which the latter denies.\n\nIn recent days, the international community has increased its calls for dialogue. Since June, the two parties have repeated that they are willing to negotiate, but have not stopped disagreeing on the modalities of future talks.\n\nDespite the resumption of fighting, the government said on Wednesday that it had \"not yet ruled out the possibility of peace\" and the rebels said the day before that they were \"open to any negotiations\".\n\nThe truce decided at the end of March had allowed the resumption of the delivery of humanitarian aid by road to Tigray, which had been interrupted for three months and which now seems to be threatened again.\n\nThe toll of this deadly war is unknown. But it has displaced more than two million people and plunged hundreds of thousands of Ethiopians into near-starvation conditions, according to the UN.\n\nTigray has also been without electricity, telecommunications, banking services or fuel for more than a year.",
    "Confronting Ethiopia's Abusive Siege": "Click to expand Image Ethiopians wait for food distribution in a small town north of Mekele, in the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, May 7, 2021. ¬© 2021 AP Photo/Ben Curtis ¬© 2021 AP Photo/Ben Curtis\n\nThe United Nations‚Äô first chartered ship carrying Ukrainian grain, which had been sitting in blockaded silos as a result of Russia‚Äôs full-scale invasion, docked in Djibouti on August 30. Free passage of this shipment, destined for Ethiopia, followed concerted pressure by African governments on Russia as well as U.N.-led negotiations. But more diplomatic muscle, including by African countries, is needed to end the Ethiopian government‚Äôs almost two-year-long chokehold on humanitarian assistance to the beleaguered Tigray region. Otherwise, many of the Ethiopians most at risk of hunger are unlikely to benefit.\n\nEthiopia is one of six countries the U.N. has singled out for having people at risk of starvation. Millions in the country‚Äôs south and east are grappling with alarming levels of hunger and malnutrition due to one of the worst droughts in decades. Communities in conflict-affected areas in the country‚Äôs north rely on humanitarian assistance. But it is in the Tigray region, specifically, where a severe starvation crisis has persisted for over a year and could be reversed through government actions.\n\nSince the outbreak of war in Tigray in November 2020, Ethiopian forces and their allies have frequently violated the laws of war. They pillaged and targeted homes and civilian infrastructure‚Äîcrimes the Tigrayan forces would later replicate in other regions‚Äîwhile shutting off basic services and severely obstructing aid to civilians caught up in the fighting. Then the authorities imposed an effective siege on the entire region, keeping out virtually all humanitarian assistance for civilians in violation of Ethiopian domestic law, international human rights, and humanitarian law.\n\nFor the first eight months of the conflict, Ethiopian forces and their allies pillaged businesses, hospitals, banks, livestock, and harvests, leaving the region dependent on assistance. The impact of this destruction has been devastating. It has prevented people from getting healthcare, food, and other basic services, and stymied the recovery of a health system broken by the conflict. For months, federal and regional forces blocked off the roads, making it nearly impossible for private actors or humanitarian agencies to carry in medical supplies or food. Supplies decreased to alarming levels.\n\nHuman Rights Watch researchers spoke to doctors in February who had treated dozens of survivors of a deadly drone strike without access to intravenous fluids or protective gloves. A journalist who traveled to Tigray in late May and early June told us he saw ‚Äúhunger everywhere.‚Äù In August, the U.N. warned that one out of three Tigrayan children under the age of 5 is acutely malnourished.\n\nSince the Ethiopian government declared a humanitarian truce in late March, humanitarian convoys previously blocked from entering Tigray were finally making it into the region. But what was getting didn‚Äôt come close to matching the mounting needs of a vulnerable population. With fuel deliveries and cash flows stymied‚Äîand the government still keeping the banks closed and telecommunications shut off‚Äîaid organizations are struggling to save lives.\n\nThe resumption of fighting in northern Ethiopia on Aug. 24 puts aid agencies‚Äô efforts at further risk. A U.N. spokesperson noted that Tigrayan fighters entered a U.N. warehouse in Tigray‚Äôs capital, Mekelle, and seized 12 fuel tankers intended for humanitarian use. Tigrayan forces have also pushed into the neighboring Amhara region. A probably Ethiopian government airstrike in Mekelle on Aug. 26 reportedly struck a kindergarten and killed at least seven people, including children. Delivery of humanitarian supplies by road remains suspended since then, as are humanitarian flights. The siege in Tigray remains very much in effect.\n\nAirstrikes, and the pillage of limited fuel supplies, will only harm Tigrayans who are already suffering the effects of the conflict and the siege. Most people in Tigray can‚Äôt buy the food that is available because the cost of staples continues to soar. A resident of the town of Shire said that the cost of teff, a grain that is one of the country‚Äôs main staple foods, had tripled over the last five months.\n\nThe U.N. Security Council sought to tackle broad restrictions on aid and essential goods in the conflicts in Yemen and South Sudan by passing a resolution in 2018 condemning the unlawful denial of lifesaving humanitarian aid and essential services as a strategy of warfare. In the hope of preventing this elsewhere, the Security Council resolution pointedly calls on the U.N. secretary-general to swiftly inform the council when the risk of conflict-induced famine arises.\n\nAnd yet, faced with flagrant violations of its own resolution in Ethiopia, the Security Council never sanctioned those most responsible for unlawful actions during the conflict. What‚Äôs more, the council hasn‚Äôt even placed the ongoing siege in Tigray on its formal agenda.\n\nConcerted African diplomacy around the Ukraine grain crisis and Russian blockade stands in stark contrast with Africa‚Äôs inaction on Ethiopia on the Security Council. The three elected members representing the African Union on the Security Council‚ÄîGabon, Ghana, and Kenya, known as the A3‚Äîhave repeatedly stalled any public discussion on Ethiopia, allowing this blatant disregard for international norms to persist.\n\nIn the meantime, Ethiopia and its partners in the region and beyond have allowed access to life‚Äôs necessities to become a political bargaining chip. Ethiopia‚Äôs state minister for foreign affairs recently said that basic services won‚Äôt be restored until the two parties begin peace talks, whereas Tigrayan authorities want services restored before talks can begin. With the resumption of fighting, it's even more essential for the world to make clear that negotiations and access to aid must be decoupled.\n\nSo, what‚Äôs to be done?\n\nThe U.N. Security Council, starting with the A3, and the African Union need to act now. They should publicly call on Ethiopia to completely lift its chokehold on desperately needed humanitarian aid and its shutdown of basic services. They should insist that the warring parties, including Tigray‚Äôs forces, abide by international law and facilitate assistance to those in need without any preconditions or delay. The Security Council should hold a public debate to address conflict-induced hunger and place Ethiopia on the council‚Äôs regular agenda.\n\nIt is crucial that such governmental practices are not normalized. Those responsible for blocking food, fuel, and medicine, as well as using basic services as a bargaining chip, should be held accountable. Those using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare by impeding relief supplies or depriving civilians of what they need for their survival can be prosecuted for war crimes. For this to happen, continuing the work of the United Nations International Commission on Human Rights in Ethiopia, which is up for renewal by the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva in September, will also be critical.\n\nAfrican and U.N. engagement over Russia‚Äôs Black Sea blockade has demonstrated what public pressure combined with diplomacy can deliver on humanitarian aid. Ships departing from Ukraine‚Äôs ports laden with grain is the best kind of dividend of that approach. But we‚Äôve also seen the opposite: a largely forgotten crisis in Ethiopia where the weaponized starvation of an entire region hasn‚Äôt generated anywhere near the same attention. Unless the international community rallies to ensure everyone in Tigray has full access to humanitarian assistance, grain shipments finally arriving in Ethiopia may not get to one of the populations in greatest need. If that‚Äôs the ultimate result, the grain deal will be a hollow victory.",

    "Ethiopia: Civilians in Western Oromia Left Unprotected": "Click to expand Image Distribution of approximate 480 damaged structures destroyed by fire in five villages in Tole kebele, Gutin, Silsaw, Chekorsa and Begene as of July 25, 2022. These numbers might be an underestimate, as it was only conducted within the area covered by the satellite imagery, and additional structures might be also affected. Satellite image: 25 July 2022. ¬© 2022 Planet Labs PBC. Analysis and graphics ¬© 2022 Human Rights Watch\n\n(Nairobi, August 31, 2022) ‚Äì An armed group killed several hundred Amhara civilians in western Oromia in June 2022 while Ethiopian security forces did little to protect them, Human Rights Watch said today. Nearly three months later, the Ethiopian government has failed to provide adequate shelter or meaningfully address the serious health and protection concerns of surviving residents.\n\nFor eight hours on June 18, heavily armed assailants shot and killed about 400 Amhara civilians, including many women and children, in villages in Tole and Sene kebeles (wards). The unidentified assailants also burned and destroyed hundreds of homes and businesses, and looted livestock and other property. Satellite imagery analysis corroborated the burning of at least five villages and the destruction of approximately 480 structures. Despite warnings, government security forces stationed nearby did not arrive until hours after the attack.\n\n‚ÄúArmed attackers destroyed one village after another, killed entire families with unmitigated cruelty, all while nearby government forces appeared to do nothing,‚Äù said Laetitia Bader, Horn of Africa director at Human Rights Watch. ‚ÄúThis is just the latest such massacre for which the Ethiopian government needs to do more to ensure credible and independent investigations, identify those responsible, and ensure adequate assistance reaches everyone in need.‚Äù\n\nSince 2019, government forces and the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) armed group have been fighting in western Oromia, resulting in serious abuses against Oromo and minority communities. Ethiopian authorities alleged that the OLA was responsible for the June massacre and other attacks. The OLA accused a government militia of carrying out the attacks and called for an independent investigation.\n\nBetween June and August, Human Rights Watch interviewed 25 people by phone, including 19 witnesses and relatives of victims from 5 villages: Gutin; Chekorsa; Silsaw; Begene, in Tole kebele in western Oromia; and a village in neighboring Sene kebele in the Benishangul Gumuz region. Human Rights Watch obtained lists of those killed from residents and analyzed satellite imagery collected before and after the attack. From April to May 2021, Human Rights Watch also interviewed 12 witnesses and family members of a similar attack in Bone kebele, in Babo Gembel district in western Oromia, and conducted follow-up interviews in August 2022.\n\nOn the morning of June 18, as male residents left to tend to their crops on nearby farmland or to go to the market, leaving woman and children in the villages, groups of heavily armed men unexpectedly attacked villages in Tole and Sene kebeles.\n\nA farmer from Gutin said he first heard gunfire and saw smoke rising from the direction of Silsaw, a village north of the main asphalt road and near Gutin and Chekorsa. ‚ÄúI ran toward my house and noticed the area encircled by gunmen,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI took my children to the bush for safety and hid in a tree near the village. The gunmen were ‚Ä¶ fully uniformed and armed ‚Ä¶ I heard them saying: ‚ÄòFinish them. Don‚Äôt Leave. End them.‚Äô‚Äù\n\nA woman from Chekorsa escaped with her five children to nearby maize fields. The attackers pursued them:\n\n\n\nMy 8-month-old child started crying. I heard an attacker say, ‚ÄòLook there, look there ‚Ä¶‚Äô before they shot in our direction. They shot my baby dead. I wrapped the dead body with some clothes I was wearing. My other child was shot in her back; the bullet came out around her neck ‚Ä¶ I then pressed my injured child against my chest, and I prayed to Allah to save her life.\n\n\n\nHer older child survived but required two weeks of hospital treatment.\n\nThe attacks lasted several hours in some villages, including until 2 p.m. in Gutin and longer in others. Five residents said they made numerous frantic calls to district authorities for help, and to federal and regional government security forces stationed in Jogir, about 17 kilometers from Tole, as well as to a military camp in Didessa. A small contingent of Ethiopian military forces arrived only at 4 p.m., after the attackers had left. Residents then began returning home, where they witnessed the aftermath of the onslaught, and began burying those killed in mass graves.\n\nIn Silsaw, residents found bodies throughout the village, including about 29 in the mosque compound. ‚ÄúFrom a single family, five, six people were killed,‚Äù said a 20-year-old woman. ‚ÄúIn other cases, families lost 20 people.‚Äù In Gutin, residents found 12 charred bodies among the remains of a burned grass house.\n\nThree residents involved in burying victims believed that over 400 people had been killed in at least 6 villages. Community leaders, who gathered lists of those killed and property destruction, estimated that at least 112 were killed in Silsaw, 105 in Chekorsa, 37 in Gutin, 72 in Begene, 16 in Hayaw, and 50 in Sene kebele. At a June 30 media briefing, a spokesperson of the Office of the Prime Minister said that the bodies of 338 people had been identified.\n\nThe attacks in Tole and Sene mirror other killings of Amhara civilians in western Oromia. Less than two weeks later, the media reported that armed groups attacked predominantly Amhara civilians in Hawa Gelan district, Kellem Wellega Zone, killing scores. A March 2021 attack on Amhara civilians in Bone kebele, West Wellega Zone, similarly left scores dead.\n\nSurvivors from Tole and Sene said that fear of continued attacks in the area, and insufficient protection and humanitarian support was forcing many residents to leave Oromia.\n\nThe United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said that at least 4,800 people were displaced from Tole, and that more than 500,000 had been displaced in western Oromia due to the conflict there.\n\nOCHA also reported that it was hard for aid groups to get access to the region because of access restrictions, inadequate funding, and a lack of humanitarian presence. Ethiopian authorities need to create a conducive environment for aid delivery, Human Rights Watch said.\n\nThe Ethiopian authorities‚Äô immediate response to the attack was to announce that they would intensify ‚Äúlaw enforcement measures‚Äù against armed groups. On July 6, Ethiopia‚Äôs parliament authorized the establishment of a special committee to investigate violence against civilians in several regions in Ethiopia, including Oromia, and to make recommendations.\n\nBut people in Tole, Sene, and Bone kebeles said there have been little signs of investigations so far. The government should provide regular public updates on its investigations, and its steps to curtail abuses by armed groups as well as federal and regional security forces and militias, Human Rights Watch said.\n\nBoth the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet and the African Union Chairman Moussa Faki called for independent investigations into the attacks in western Oromia. In a June 30 Oral Update before the UN Human Rights Council, the chairperson of the UN International Commission of Human Rights Experts on Ethiopia expressed alarm at atrocities against civilians in Ethiopia, including western Oromia, and urged member states to provide the commission with experienced investigators and other support.\n\n‚ÄúCommunities in western Oromia have been left reeling from repeated attacks and are living in fear of the next attack,‚Äù Bader said. ‚ÄúEthiopian authorities should urgently move beyond promises to act and provide urgent and adequate humanitarian assistance to affected communities, and support for credible independent investigations.‚Äù\n\nConflict in Western Oromia\n\nSince 2019, Ethiopian government forces and the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) armed group have engaged in an armed conflict in western Oromia. The OLA was previously the military wing of the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF), a once-banned political opposition group, that fought a low-level insurgency for the self-determination of Oromos for decades.\n\nAfter Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed assumed office in April 2018, the government reached an agreement with various opposition groups, including the exiled leaders of the Oromo Liberation Front in Eritrea, who agreed to lay down arms, reintegrate, and commit to a peaceful political struggle. However, negotiations soon broke down.\n\nBy early 2019, the government had established military command posts in western and southern Oromia. Federal and regional security forces began coordinated military operations against the OLA. In April 2019, the OLA formally broke its ties with the OLF and continued its armed operations.\n\nThe conflict has resulted in serious human rights abuses. Government forces have carried out summary executions, arbitrary arrests, and detentions of Oromos, and have at times cut communications in the area. The OLA has killed government officials and attacked non-military government offices. Unidentified armed assailants have also been implicated in killings, abductions, destruction of homes, and mass displacements of ethnic Amhara communities. Residents of Tole kebele in western Oromia said that OLA fighters in the neighboring hills for the past three years have abducted people and demanded ransom.\n\nHuman Rights Watch documented a March 30, 2021, attack on Babo Gembel district, West Wellega Zone. At around 8 p.m., gunmen surrounded Sedeka village, in Bone kebele, forced the Amhara residents to gather for a meeting, and shot 28 dead. A man who had fled the village as residents were being gathered said that the armed men spoke Afaan-Oromo, the Oromo language, and had distinctive long hair, which residents said was common among OLA fighters. He climbed a tree and stayed there until 2 a.m., ‚ÄúI later heard gunfire,‚Äù he said at the time. Residents called for help from the Oromia regional special forces, who were stationed about 30 minutes away, but they didn‚Äôt arrive until 2 a.m., long after the attack had ended.\n\nOne village leader lost his brother and his sister-in-law in the attack. ‚ÄúWe had just celebrated their marriage on Thursday [March 25], and they were then killed on Tuesday evening,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAfter all the preparations to celebrate their marriage, we began to prepare for their funeral ‚Ä¶ A mother of a 15-day-old baby was also among the killed.‚Äù\n\nAttacks in Tole and Sene Kebeles, June 18\n\nOn June 14, the OLA clashed with government forces in the Gambella region, and in Gimbi town, in western Oromia, 49 kilometers from Tole kebele. Around June 17, government security forces stationed in Tole, along with a small number of local militiamen and Oromia police, left the area without explanation, several local residents said.\n\nIn the early hours of June 18, residents in several villages in the adjacent Tole and Sene kebeles saw armed men gathering. They said the attackers wore a mix of civilian clothes and uniforms worn by the Oromia regional special forces, militias, and the former Ethiopian national military uniform. They later noted that they spoke in Afaan Oromo and some of the armed men had long hair.\n\nAt 7 a.m., a farmer in Silsaw village and a kebele official, among others, called various officials and security forces for protection and support. The official said, ‚ÄúWhen I first called, they said they couldn‚Äôt take action, without discussion and reaching an agreement with the zone [an administrative division].‚Äù\n\nAround 9 a.m., attackers began shooting near Silsaw village in Tole kebele andstarted torching village buildings. Residents said scores of men, armed with military assault weapons, then stormed villages around Tole and Sene kebeles and pursued residents who fled into surrounding areas.\n\nSome farmers around Silsaw and other villages reported that they initially tried to resist the attack, but were outnumbered by the armed men, who carried machine guns, rifles, and Kalashnikov assault weapons. ‚ÄúSome of the men among us had our own guns,‚Äù said a farmer from Silsaw. ‚ÄúWhen they started shooting, we also tried to defend ourselves. Twelve people among us who were trying to defend themselves were also killed.‚Äù\n\nMany residents began to flee into nearby farmland or river areas. An 18-year-old woman from Silsaw village described being captured:\n\nI was fetching water when these forces approached. I ran to Chekorsa village, but I was caught and taken away from there to a field. Others that were running away were shot. They gathered other people as well [and brought them to the field]. Many were children. We were around 60. They asked us for money, phones, jewelry, and watches. After they took our property, they started shooting. They were bragging, as they were shooting ‚Ä¶ saying ‚ÄúWe are heroes, and no one can escape from us. We will kill you all. Even those who escape, we will come after you wherever you are.‚Äù\n\n\n\nThe woman said she was shot in the arm, around her back, and in her leg, but managed to survive, along with seven other people.\n\nA man, 48, said: ‚ÄúWe hid in the bushes. Two people were killed near me. One was my wife‚Äôs relative. He left behind three young children.‚Äù\n\nA woman, 20, fled Silsaw village along with her aunt and her aunt‚Äôs 6-month-old twins. ‚ÄúI was carrying one of the babies ‚Ä¶ It was such a difficult moment,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBullets were going over our heads. I thought we were doomed. We survived by God‚Äôs mercy.‚Äù\n\nRetrieval of Bodies, Burials\n\nAt about 4 p.m., a small contingent of Ethiopian military forces arrived in Tole kebele. Residents began returning home that evening.\n\nA farmer, 48, from Gutin lost four family members, including his 22-year-old in daughter-in-law and his 4-year-old granddaughter. He found their charred bodies along with 10 other people, in a burned grass-thatched house in the village. He said that 5 of those killed were children under age 8.\n\nIn Sene kebele, a man from Sene village returned to find 21 people in his compound dead, including his wife and daughter, 8 other relatives, and several neighbors. His 11-year-old son survived but had been shot 4 times.\n\nA man from Chekorsa said he had desperately searched for his family:\n\nI tried to go check on the house where I took my family members [for safety], but they weren‚Äôt there. I looked for them in the maize fields but couldn‚Äôt find them. I heard that many people were collected and killed in Silsaw [a neighboring village]. I saw people injured and dead on the way.\n\n\n\nHe said he found the bodies of his wife, who was 8-months‚Äô pregnant, and their three young children in the mosque compound, where the assailants had gathered and executed 29 people:\n\nMy wife and three children, ages 2, 6 and 10, were killed with others in the compound of the mosque. Everyone was rushing to identify the dead bodies. I tried to help gather those killed. It was raining heavily at the time.\n\nIt‚Äôs difficult to explain what I felt after what happened. I can‚Äôt say that human beings did this. It is the maximum cruelty I have seen. We couldn‚Äôt bury them all that day.\n\n\n\nResidents said that 112 people were killed in Silsaw alone and that they buried about 60 people in the mosque compound. Community leaders said that over 400 people were killed in Tole and Sene areas, during the June 18 attack, and had made lists of the dead.\n\n‚ÄúThe majority of the victims were women and children,‚Äù a kebele official from Gutin village said. ‚ÄúThe village was filled with dead bodies ‚Ä¶ We started collecting them and burying them in different areas, some in mass graves.‚Äù\n\nSome of the survivors had been displaced from other areas. ‚ÄúWe previously lived in Arjo [East Wellega Zone],‚Äù said a 38-year-old woman from Tole. ‚ÄúWe were forced to leave the area after our houses were burned and property looted. That was eight months ago, and we fled to Tole, now [this] happened again.‚Äù\n\nLooting and Destruction of Property\n\nThe assailants looted property and livestock and destroyed civilian structures during the attack. Satellite imagery recorded on June 18, at about 10 a.m., shows smoke plumes emanating from Gutin, Chekorsa, and Silsaw villages. Additional smoke plumes were visible over Gutin 45 minutes later. Thermal anomaly data collected by an environmental sensor, and reviewed by Human Rights Watch, also confirms the time of those attacks, showing several fires in Tole kebele.\n\nClick to expand Image Six distinct smoke plumes emanating from Gutin, Chekorsa, Silsaw villages and surrounding areas in Tole kebele, Oromia region, Ethiopia, on June 18 at 10:07 am local time.

Analysis & graphics ¬© 2022 Human Rights Watch.\n\nHuman Rights Watch was able to estimate the scale of the destruction by analyzing satellite imagery recorded on July 25. Damage signatures detected on satellite imagery are consistent with arson and confirm the destruction of approximately 480 structures across 5 villages in Tole kebele, including Gutin, Chekorsa, Silsaw and Begene, but were unable to identify the fifth village with visible destruction. Most of the damaged structures seen on imagery are tukuls (huts). Silsaw and Begene recorded the highest number of structures affected. These numbers might be an underestimate, as it only included the area covered by the satellite imagery.\n\nA man from Chekorsa said that his house had bullet holes and several other houses in the village were burned, and stores destroyed.\n\n‚ÄúI had so many properties back there,‚Äù said a man from Silsaw. ‚ÄúI had a farm, I just brought fertilizer. But my house was burned down, I lost everything.‚Äù He had left Silsaw for Wollo, in the Amhara region and had no plans to return.\n\nClick to expand Image Satellite image showing a snapshot of the substantial damaged structures by fire across four different villages in Tole kebele, Oromia region, Ethiopia.

Analysis and graphics ¬© 2022 Human Rights Watch\n\nThree residents from Silsaw and Begene villages said that a separate group of attackers had looted property, including livestock and personal items. A resident of Begene said:\n\nThere were three groups. The first that killed people indiscriminately, a second group that looted cows and properties, and a third that burned houses. Sixteen of my cows were taken, and 100 quintals [a unit of weight equal to 112 pounds] of grain destroyed. My house was burned down, and I lost over 200,000 Ethiopian birr [US$3,800].\n\n\n\nInadequate Investigations and Humanitarian Assistance\n\nThe government and the Ethiopian Red Cross reported that they provided humanitarian assistance to residents following the June 18 attack. However, remaining residents who spoke to Human Rights Watch said that they only received a one-time distribution of food, and as of August lacked shelter and faced serious health risks.\n\nA farmer, 48, from Silsaw said: ‚ÄúWe are now living with the help of the Ethiopian military who are sharing their own food ‚Ä¶ We don‚Äôt even have enough cooking utensils, so we are sharing one utensil among 10 people.‚Äù A man from Chekorsa said a registration of remaining residents took place in early August but added that they still did not receive any additional aid.\n\nA farmer from Begene said: ‚ÄúThere is nowhere to shelter now. It‚Äôs the rainy season. We sometimes use plastic shelter from the rain. But we don‚Äôt have enough food to sustain our lives ... we are worried about malaria.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to remove the weeds from the farms, but we can‚Äôt because it‚Äôs not safe. The Ethiopian military can‚Äôt protect us there so people are losing hope to live here and are leaving ‚Ä¶ Many went to Wollo or Debre Birhan [in the Amhara region].‚Äù\n\nSurvivors with serious injuries have also faced obstacles to receiving adequate medical care. The man from Sene whose 11-year-old son was shot four times said he had been struggling to get him proper treatment: ‚ÄúI am begging to treat my son and moving from hospital to hospital ‚Ä¶ My son is not completely healed, but the hospital gave me a discharge letter. And I don‚Äôt know where to take him now. I am standing in the rain. I don‚Äôt know where to go. Right now, I have nothing.‚Äù\n\nSimilarly, more than 18 months after the March 2021 attack on Bone kebele, the survivors were still living at a displacement site in Benishangul-Gumuz. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been four months since we received food aid, we are starving,‚Äù said the village leader in August. ‚ÄúWe received a call from the local authorities to return, but still, we are afraid. We were informed that it is still insecure ‚Ä¶We heard that only four people were punished, and that many residents seeking to flee have been abducted.‚Äù\n\nSeveral residents from Tole raised concerns that the government had inadequately investigated the attack. ‚ÄúOne week after the incident, a wereda (district) official and the vice-president of the Oromia regional state came and talked to us,‚Äù said a man from Gutin. ‚ÄúSince then, no one has talked to us.‚Äù A farmer from Begene said that ‚Äúno government body came to my village to investigate the number of killings or property destroyed.‚Äù\n\nHowever, a farmer from Silsaw said that government investigators came once to speak to communities gathered around Chekorsa village: ‚ÄúThey went around Chekorsa and Silsaw. They went to Silsaw to observe where people were buried, and property destroyed. But they didn‚Äôt go to other areas where the attacks happened.‚Äù\n\nRecommendations\n\nAll parties to the armed conflict in western Oromia should facilitate the provision of humanitarian assistance to all populations at risk. They should also cooperate and provide full, unimpeded access to independent investigators to all conflict-affected areas.\n\nThe Ethiopian government should:\n\nPublicly provide information on the steps it is taking to investigate and appropriately prosecute killings, pillage, the destruction of property, and other abuses by non-state armed groups.\n\nUrgently provide or facilitate humanitarian assistance, including food, medical care, and shelter to Amhara and other communities affected by June 18 violence and other incidents of violence in Oromia.\n\nInvestigate the role of local and regional authorities and national security forces who may have been negligent in their duty to protect civilians, and publicly disclose the results of the investigation.\n\nEnsure credible, independent, and impartial investigations into reports of security force abuses, including arbitrary arrests and extrajudicial executions of Oromo communities in western Oromia.\n\nTo the OLA and other armed groups operating in western Oromia:",
    "Avoiding the Abyss as War Resumes in Northern Ethiopia - Ethiopia": "Renewed fighting between a federal-Amhara-Eritrea coalition and Tigray‚Äôs forces has shattered a tenuous months-long truce. The reversal heralds a return to one of the world‚Äôs deadliest conflicts. International envoys should keep pressing the Ethiopian parties to renew the truce and begin formal direct negotiations.\n\nWar rages ‚Äì again ‚Äì in northern Ethiopia. The resumption of conflict on 24 August between the federal military, forces from the Amhara region, which borders Tigray, and Eritrean troops, on one side, and Tigray forces, on the other, marks the breach of a roughly nine-month truce that had largely halted some of the world‚Äôs deadliest fighting. The return to blows is a setback for a struggling peace process and strenuous efforts to get food to millions of besieged Tigrayans. Although it is unclear exactly why combat restarted or whether either side planned a sustained campaign, both immediately escalated, with a Tigrayan offensive to the south into Amhara and a joint Ethiopian-Eritrean incursion into Tigray from the north. Sustained full-blown hostilities would mean prolongation of a likely unwinnable war, creating more mass suffering. Instead, the Ethiopian parties must renew the truce and overcome the obstacles that have impeded the beginning of formal talks. Concerted high-level pressure by donors, many of whom have been distracted by the Ukraine crisis, will likely be vital to any breakthrough.\n\nA Return to Arms\n\nFighting in Ethiopia‚Äôs nearly two-year civil war ‚Äì a brutal conflict that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives, displaced millions and generated credible reports of atrocities on all sides ‚Äì resumed in northern Amhara on 24 August. Efforts to commence formal talks have failed to end the siege and humanitarian crisis in Tigray, and tensions have been rising over the course of the summer. As when the war broke out in November 2020, each side blamed the other for starting the hostilities, and it is not clear who shot first. As in 2020, federal troops had been massing near Tigray‚Äôs southern border for weeks. In recent months, Tigray‚Äôs leaders have also bolstered their own forces through rearming, recruitment and training.\n\nThe late August clashes in northern Amhara ‚Äì just south of a part of Tigray that Amhara groups claim as their own ‚Äì were preceded by smaller incidents. Federal forces shelled Tigray positions at Dedebit in north-western Tigray on 15 August. That was the first serious violation of a truce dating back, in effect, to December 2021 but formalised in March. Then, on 24 August, the day fighting to the south began, the federal military said it had shot down a plane the previous evening coming from Sudanese airspace to deliver weapons to Tigray. No independent source has verified that the plane was indeed carrying arms, but Tigray has previously received other air deliveries of unspecified cargo that Addis Ababa believes to have been lethal aid.\n\nWhether or not either side fully intended it, the fighting quickly spread, taking the country back to full-blown confrontation. Tigray‚Äôs fighters seem to have had the better of the first exchanges in the south, taking the northern Amhara town of Kobo on 27 August; Tigrayan media showed footage of prisoners of war arriving in Alamata town in southern Tigray. For its part, the federal air force bombed Tigray‚Äôs capital Mekelle on 26 August, and again overnight on 30-31 August, reportedly causing deaths by hitting a kindergarten and civilian areas near the main hospital.\n\nAs new fronts opened, each side painted the other as the aggressor. On 1 September, Tigray authorities said the Ethiopian and Eritrean armies had launched major offensives from Eritrea to the north. On Twitter, Eritrea‚Äôs ambassador to Kenya and Tanzania implicitly confirmed Asmara‚Äôs renewed involvement. Federal authorities, a day earlier, accused Tigray forces of staging an ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù of areas to the west of Kobo and also close to the disputed Sudanese border in Western Tigray. The latter clashes reportedly involved Tigrayan former UN peacekeepers who were stranded in Sudan during the war when they refused to return to Ethiopia. A top Tigray official told Crisis Group that these forces were defending their position near the Sudanese border, and that federal and Amhara units had tried to penetrate Tigray in the south.\n\nWar, Truce and War Again\n\nEthiopia‚Äôs civil war began in November 2020, when a constitutional dispute between Tigray and federal leaders escalated into conflict amid a prolonged power struggle. Momentum has repeatedly flipped sides. At first, the federal government (backed by Eritrea‚Äôs military and Amhara forces) pushed into Tigray, took Mekelle and compelled the region‚Äôs ruling Tigray People‚Äôs Liberation Front (TPLF) administration to flee to mountainous areas. Tigray forces subsequently regrouped to launch a guerrilla campaign that thwarted federal plans and, months later, recaptured Mekelle and reinstalled the TPLF government. In July 2021, partly in response to a renewed federal blockade, Tigray‚Äôs troops mounted an offensive, pushing in several directions in Amhara (amid accusations of atrocities), as well as south toward Addis Ababa in an attempt to dislodge Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed‚Äôs government. Then, in turn, the federal government, armed with new drones and backed by strong popular mobilisation, beat back Tigray‚Äôs forces, which retreated to their home region in December.\n\nThe subsequent lull in fighting evolved into a fragile, informal truce, with both sides making conciliatory gestures. In December, Addis Ababa ordered the release of key opposition prisoners and put forward a plan for national dialogue to address Ethiopia‚Äôs long-festering political challenges. In late March, the parties formalised a humanitarian truce, after which critical aid deliveries into Tigray began picking up. In the precarious new status quo, federal troops stayed largely outside Tigray, while Tigrayan forces left the Amhara holding onto Western Tigray (which the Amhara call Welkait) ‚Äì where rights group say Amhara groups have committed atrocities and displaced 700,000, mostly Tigrayan residents, since the war began. Eritrean soldiers continued to occupy parts of Western Tigray (in the north) and north-eastern Tigray.\n\nEven following the truce, the humanitarian situation in Tigray remained dire. Despite the increase in food aid, Addis Ababa and its allies continued to block commercial traffic into the region, while tightly restricting the fuel supply and failing to restore Tigray‚Äôs electricity, telecommunications and banking services, all of which the federal government had severed in the conflict‚Äôs early phase and cut again after leaving Mekelle in June 2021.\n\nEfforts to get peace talks off the ground also foundered. Both sides took steps and offered commitments to engage in formal negotiations, but the latter never commenced amid squabbling between the two sides over mediators and preconditions. While the federal government and many outside actors backed an African Union-led process, the Tigray authorities expressed scepticism that this body, which is headquartered in Addis Ababa, could act as a fair arbiter, and rejected a lead role for its envoy, former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo. Tigray authorities have said they prefer Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta as mediator, but he is leaving power, having served his final term. It is unclear if Kenyatta could still play such a role after his anointed successor, Raila Odinga, lost to Deputy President William Ruto, who has a bitter relationship with Kenyatta, in Kenya‚Äôs 9 August election. Further complicating matters, the federal government demanded talks without preconditions, while Tigray authorities made negotiations contingent on both unfettered humanitarian operations and a full restoration of services, as well as the return of Western Tigray (a hotly contested area that the Amhara, who currently control it, claim the TPLF violently annexed in the early 1990s).\n\nInternational efforts to steer the parties toward peace have been uneven. Distracted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Western capitals reduced their high-level focus exactly as the truce in Ethiopia was beginning to take hold. The diplomacy that persists is often disjointed. For instance, the U.S., which has now dispatched its third regional envoy since creating the post in April 2021, facilitated a secret meeting between senior officials from both sides in June in Djibouti (there was a similar one earlier in Seychelles), where the federal government pledged to restore services to Tigray. But there was little follow-up to that meeting, with Tigray accusing Addis Ababa of breaking its pledge and Washington of failing to act as guarantor. When the AU‚Äôs Obasanjo subsequently tried to go to Mekelle days after a joint UN, U.S. and EU visit, and with still no progress made toward service restoration, Tigray‚Äôs leaders took it as another sign Abiy was reneging on the Djibouti pledges and rejected his request to visit. Obasanjo‚Äôs call for Eritrea to also attend prospective talks caught many other actors by surprise and cemented Mekelle‚Äôs view that he should not lead mediation efforts.\n\nFor Tigrayans, the conflict‚Äôs further escalation would bring major risks. Any form of renewed war is in fact likely to worsen the blockade of Tigray and the humanitarian crisis, with all aid operations to Tigray suspended since hostilities kicked off. In a 23 August letter to international partners, which reiterated demands for federal authorities to restore services and return Western Tigray to Mekelle‚Äôs control, Tigray‚Äôs president concluded by warning again that the region would fight to end the blockade if necessary. But the reality is that, while Tigray may well be able to demonstrate its military prowess, it looks unlikely to achieve its ends in the short term. Its forces would face a major challenge in seeking to break through the combined force of federal, Amhara and Eritrean troops to open and then maintain a corridor to neighbouring Sudan. Nor is there much reason to think that another push south, aimed at overthrowing Abiy, is likelier to succeed than last time. Rather, renewed fighting could well embolden hardliners in Addis Ababa and Asmara, as well as among Amhara‚Äôs political leaders who want to double down on the siege strategy that has so devastated Tigray.\n\nAbiy, too, would likely lose out from an escalation. He still has no viable military and political strategy for bending Mekelle to his will. His administration has already proven unable to hold and govern Tigray in the face of a resolute and popular insurgency, which his own brutal tactics served to inflame. A rebooted full-blown war is likely to increase his government‚Äôs international isolation at a time when the Ethiopian economy desperately needs foreign aid, while bogging Addis Ababa down in a costly, deadly and unwinnable conflict with a foe that has had time to regroup and is fighting for its survival. Clashes near the Ethiopia-Sudan border in an area contested by those two states as well as by Amhara and Tigray raise the stakes further. Should these skirmishes persist, Sudanese troops could become involved, possibly in a de facto alliance with Tigray forces. That development would increase the likelihood of a disastrous, wider confrontation, pitting Sudan against Ethiopia ‚Äì they are already at loggerheads over disputed border areas and Ethiopia‚Äôs new megadam on the Blue Nile river ‚Äì and maybe Eritrea as well.\n\nIf any actor expects to gain from more violence, it is probably Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki, whose forces fought alongside federal and Amhara troops against Tigray during the war‚Äôs first phases, re-entered the fray recently and, as noted above, continue to occupy parts of the region‚Äôs west and north east. Isaias considers the TPLF a historical and existential foe. He thus opposes any rapprochement between the TPLF and Addis Ababa that would mean rehabilitating the Tigray party (he almost certainly welcomed Ethiopian federal authorities classifying the TPLF as a terrorist organisation in May 2021). He may well struggle to take on Tigray on his own, however, meaning that he is unlikely to be able to pursue war if Abiy wants to return to the truce.\n\nRenewing the Truce\n\nIt is essential that the African and international envoys who have been engaged diplomatically continue to demand that the main antagonists rein in their forces, prevent further escalation and agree on a new truce ‚Äì while beginning to set the stage for formal talks. The window for averting a return to a sustained full-blown war appears to be short. Until a 2 August visit to Mekelle by the EU, U.S. and UN special envoys ‚Äì which has now been followed by an early September visit to Addis Ababa, under way as this statement goes to press, by the U.S. and UN emissaries, plus Obasanjo ‚Äì outside actors working for a peaceful resolution had been watching too passively, as a volatile standoff drifted back toward conflict and the peace process stalled. A higher-level, more intense degree of engagement is required.\n\nThe main external actors, including the AU, U.S., EU and UN, as well as Kenya, should move immediately and in concert. The recent joint trips by envoys to Mekelle and Addis Ababa are a welcome start and should be paired with higher-level engagement from all, such as telephone calls from senior officials. They should make clear to Abiy‚Äôs government that major non-humanitarian assistance, including World Bank projects and any new International Monetary Fund financing, may be in jeopardy should the federal government fail to stop its offensives and continue the de facto blockade of Tigray. The war puts donors seeking to ease Ethiopia‚Äôs economic difficulty in a bind. Yet, while they should keep scaling up humanitarian relief, they should take direct budget support off the table for now lest they wind up bankrolling a revived federal war effort. Further, donors risk undermining a key incentive for Abiy to make peace should they continue to ramp up major development assistance even as war resumes.\n\nExternal players, including the AU, should also insist with as much unity as possible that Eritrea withdraw its troops from Tigray (and that Abiy press for this result) and that the federal government honour its representatives‚Äô private pledges at the U.S.-facilitated June meeting in Djibouti with Tigray officials to restore banking, telecommunications and electricity services to the beleaguered region.\n\nOutside actors should lean on Tigray as well. They should keep demanding that its leaders desist from steps that would further escalate the fighting and agree to a truce. Mekelle should agree to hold the necessary discussions with the federal authorities on the logistical and security aspects of restoring services to Tigray, such as how to manage payments and provide security for installation and maintenance technicians. Diplomats also need to mediate a dispute between Tigray‚Äôs government and the World Food Programme after the former grabbed twelve WFP tankers on 25 August, saying the UN agency refused to return in kind fuel it was owed. Tigray‚Äôs seizure of the WFP fuel trucks creates a further constraint on already woefully insufficient humanitarian operations that have left at least half of Tigray‚Äôs approximately seven million people in need of support. Unless the incident is remedied, federal authorities are likely to use it as a reason to restrict, or completely close off, the region‚Äôs fuel supply, arguing that Tigray‚Äôs authorities redirect humanitarian assistance to their military operation.\n\nIf the parties can be persuaded to de-escalate and restore the truce, the next step is clearing still substantial hurdles to formal talks. At the end of August, a senior Tigray commander insisted to Crisis Group that the federal government must at least publicly commit to completely lifting the blockade and restoring services before any form of discussions can occur. For its part, Addis Ababa‚Äôs latest position on the issue was that those things would happen only alongside discussions over a permanent ceasefire. An Ethiopian diplomat told Crisis Group on 31 August that it was not practical to restore services with the TPLF still armed and prepared for war.\n\nMuch as African and international players should continue to insist that Ethiopia restore services, Tigray‚Äôs leaders should also weigh whether their demands for the government to fulfil what they cast as its legal obligations in advance of talks are well advised, particularly if they help prolong an intolerable, immiserating status quo. There are alternatives that could allow Mekelle to maintain a position of principle while making practical progress toward peace. For example, Tigray‚Äôs representatives could attend formal talks but limit their discussions to the logistical and security issues of reconnecting Tigray to trade, aid and services, leaving formal talks on other issues until the government has lifted the siege. In such a scenario, the formality of the process and extra international scrutiny could help increase external pressure on the federal government to honour its pledge to restore services and end its punishment of Tigray‚Äôs civilian population, even if international actors‚Äô pleas to this effect have long gone unheeded.\n\nAnother hugely difficult issue that will likely need to be finessed until talks get off the ground is the status of Western Tigray. The area has been administered by Tigray throughout the current federal era that began in the early 1990s, but is also claimed by the Amhara, which seized it when the present conflict began, citing their longstanding stance that the TPLF forcibly took it, displacing the native population when the Tigrayan party rose to power in the 1990s. The 2020 Amhara takeover involved the violent expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Tigrayans and widely reported atrocities by Amhara forces and militia against civilians. Tigray‚Äôs leaders face substantial pressure from Tigrayans not to make concessions that legitimise these new facts on the ground and have refused to negotiate over the area‚Äôs constitutional status. Reclaiming the area would also allow the besieged region a corridor to resupply itself through Sudan.\n\nFinding common ground with respect to Western Tigray will be no small task, as the sides remain far apart. Amhara outright rejects Tigray‚Äôs demand that it withdraw and return the territory to its pre-war status, and Addis Ababa has thus far declined to force the issue. Abiy may well have assessed that favouring Tigray in this instance would be too costly for him in Amhara, which has been a core pillar of his political and wartime coalition. In recent months, in order to assert control, the federal and Amhara governments have arrested thousands of members of Amhara‚Äôs nationalist militia, known as Fano, causing opposition to Abiy to grow in Ethiopia‚Äôs second-largest region. Abiy can ill afford to lose more Amhara support given the host of other problems his government is facing, including the growing rebellion in Ethiopia‚Äôs most populous region, Oromia, which is nominally Abiy‚Äôs base. Furthermore, the prospect of Tigray gaining the capacity to resupply itself from Sudan via Western Tigray is unacceptable both to Abiy and Isaias.\n\nRather than let the intractable Western Tigray issue continue to be an obstacle to de-escalation and peace talks, the parties should get around the table and discuss disagreements there. To help matters along, the federal government could publicly acknowledge that Amhara‚Äôs violent takeover was unconstitutional, and call for Amhara and Eritrean forces to leave the area so recently displaced residents can return. These steps could open the door to Tigray representatives attending the talks, although it would also require Mekelle to implicitly accept the need for a political process on Western Tigray and, during that process, federal control of the area if and when the other forces leave. Tigrayan and federal commitments to a future political process to assess the various claims might help ease Amhara concerns. Long-term solutions that might emerge from those discussions include Amhara and Tigray agreeing to jointly administer the area, ensuring minority rights protections or creating an autonomous district accountable directly to the federal government.\n\nLast is the question of mediation. To ease Tigrayan concerns about AU mediation, the AU could create a panel of senior African officials to lead the process, which in addition to Obasanjo could include representatives from the Kenyan, South African and/or Algerian governments. Should talks progress to permanent ceasefire arrangements, Western partners, particularly the U.S. and EU, would likely need to act as guarantors of any agreement. The UN would probably be best positioned to monitor it, though reaching agreement to such an arrangement in Addis Ababa and New York will not be easy. In any event, more coordinated efforts from all the major outside actors will be necessary to hold the parties to their commitments and to get talks under way. Such a boosted approach will also be required in the future to deal with sticky Western Tigray discussions, as well as all aspects of re-establishing relations between the federal and Tigray governments, including Mekelle‚Äôs demand for a self-determination referendum and the future status of Tigray‚Äôs forces.\n\nTo alter the current trajectory, high-level visits to Addis and Mekelle by the U.S. and other international officials may be useful; ideally, these would be coordinated for maximum effect (as indeed happened with the joint visit to Mekelle by the U.S., EU and UN special envoys in early August, even though that proved insufficient to curb the renewed fighting). To further raise awareness of the gravity of the situation, African leaders might convene a meeting on Ethiopia‚Äôs crisis at the forthcoming UN General Assembly. While focused international attention is vital to prevent more carnage, the onus for preventing more senseless death and suffering in Ethiopia rests on Ethiopian leaders on both sides of the conflict, as well as Eritrea‚Äôs government. If the parties do not find a way to address their differences around the negotiating table, then the brutal war will continue, with Ethiopia‚Äôs people paying the price of their failure.",

    "Feature: Ethiopian coffee garners popularity among Chinese consumers": "ADDIS ABABA, Sept. 26 (Xinhua) -- The increasing number of consumers and growing popularity of Ethiopia's coffee among the Chinese people is propelling Ethiopia's coffee export market, officials and coffee exporters said.\n\n\"Currently, the youth in China are really fond of Ethiopian coffee and we are witnessing growing coffee market share in China and other parts of Asia,\" Adugna Debela, director general of the Ethiopian Coffee and Tea Authority (ECTA), said in a recent interview with Xinhua.\n\nFigures from ECTA showed that Ethiopia exported 11,935.65 metric tons of coffee to China during the last Ethiopian fiscal year which ended on July 7, earning 65.31 million U.S. dollars, up by 84 percent year on year.\n\nThe increase has made China the seventh major importer of Ethiopian coffee last fiscal year (July 8, 2021-July 7, 2022), up from 33rd in the previous fiscal year (July 8, 2020-July 7, 2021)\n\nEthiopia obtained a record 1.4 billion U.S. dollars from exporting over 300,000 metric tons of coffee last Ethiopian fiscal year. The top five export destinations were Germany, the U.S., Saudi Arabia, Belgium and Japan.\n\nDebela argued that China would be one of the main destinations for Ethiopian coffee due to its population size and the growing coffee drinking habits among the people.\n\n\"Very recently, countries like China, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates are coming to the front line, after consumers in those countries tested and proved that Ethiopian coffee is an organic one,\" Debela said.\n\nAmid the growing demand for Ethiopian coffee in the Chinese coffee market, a growing number of Ethiopian coffee growers and exporters are vying to penetrate the emerging Chinese coffee market.\n\nIsrael Degefa, Chief Executive Officer of Kerchanshe Trading, the largest producer and exporter of coffee in Ethiopia, shares the idea of the director general and anticipates \"China would be one of the main destinations for Ethiopian coffee in the near future.\"\n\n\"In general, the Chinese market is growing every year and we are tripling our export to China both in volume of coffee and value. The demand is high and we are preparing to grow more coffee to feed the Chinese market,\" Degefa said.\n\nEthiopia, which is known as the origin of Arabica coffee, is recognized worldwide for its rich coffee quality, variety of flavors and aroma, making the demand for the commodity increase globally.\n\nFor Degefa, the rising demand for Ethiopian coffee in China has to do with a cultural shift. \"I think there is a cultural shift among the Chinese people. The Chinese new generation is adapting to drink tea and coffee concurrently,\" Degefa said.\n\nTemesgen Cherkos, export manager of Hadeed Trading Private Limited Company, said his company is making increasing shipments of coffee to China, attributing the rise in the volume of coffee export to growing coffee drinking habits in China.\n\n\"We have been sending coffee to China for two years now. We exported a small volume of coffee the previous year but this year, after we got registered in China, we are exporting an increasing volume of coffee to China. At least we make shipments of 10 containers of coffee to China every month,\" he said.\n\nThere are about 5 million coffee growers in Ethiopia and more than 25 million people in the country depend on coffee production and processing for their livelihood. Also coffee accounts for up to 30 percent of Ethiopia's export revenue, according to ECTA.\n\nHowever, figures from the ECTA show that only 12 percent of Ethiopian coffee export commands the highest price in the international coffee market due to lack of using modern technology and the best variety of species in the production and processing of coffee.\n\nAccording to ECTA, coffee Arabica is highly vulnerable to changing climatic conditions, especially the desert weather which is posing a potential threat to coffee production. ‚ñ†",

Now, trucks have delivered a portion of that wheat to the World Food Program's main warehouse in Ethiopia, where food aid is desperately needed.\n\nThe World Food Program said the 23,000 tons of grain is enough to feed 1.5 million people on full rations for a month.\n\nSome of the grain is destined for Somalia, which like the rest of the Horn of Africa is reeling from severe drought.\n\nWhile it is not clear how much grain is going to Ethiopia, the WFP has said it hopes to reach 11.5 million Ethiopians in need by the end of 2022.\n\nThe WFP said food needs to continue to flow in for that to happen. Ukrainian food exports were cut off for months until Ukraine and Russia reached an U.N.-backed agreement last month to open a corridor for the free flow of food shipments.\n\nThe WFP says this is the first humanitarian aid shipment from Ukraine to arrive in Ethiopia under the agreement.\n\nEthiopia is experiencing drought and conflict in the northern Tigray region which have put more than 20 million people nationwide in need of humanitarian assistance.\n\nThe recently renewed clashes between the government forces and the rebel Tigray People‚Äôs Liberation Front have displaced more people, and the lack of access to some areas has complicated relief efforts.",

    "Ethiopia‚Äôs Industrial Hopes Dwindle as Conflict, Sanctions Take Toll": "Ethiopia once said it wanted to become the \"China of Africa\" ‚Äî that is, a manufacturing hub ‚Äî with the help of its industrial parks. But the global economic downturn and the country's ongoing conflict have prompted companies to leave the parks and lay off thousands of workers.\n\nThe Ethiopian government hoped that one the country‚Äôs industrial parks ‚Äî Hawassa, which was opened in 2016 with the potential to create 60,000 jobs ‚Äî would help the country move from an agricultural to a manufacturing economy, and that the companies operating there would bring high-tech work.\n\nKalkidan Asrat, a logistics manager Nasa Garment at the Hawassa Industrila Park, shared those dreams.\n\nHer birthplace, she said, is a small town and her family worked in agriculture for a living as subsistence farmers. When she completed her education, she joined the industrial park, where she said she was able to improve her prospects.\n\nThere are 10 other industrial parks like Hawassa spread across Ethiopia.\n\nThe government has said it hoped to make Ethiopia a lower middle-income country by 2025, with manufacturing playing a big part.\n\nThat is now looking less likely because of the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation, a lack of foreign currency in the country, and conflict and human rights abuses.\n\n\"Two of the industrial parks have been directly impacted. They‚Äôve been in the combat zone, effectively,‚Äù said emerging markets economist Patrick Heinisch. ‚ÄúThe most severe hit to the industrial parks is from the loss of access to AGOA. One week after the announcement, the first company announced they would retreat from the Ethiopian market; they sold their factories in Ethiopia. This has been followed by other companies.\"\n\nThe African Growth and Opportunity Act, or AGOA, passed in the U.S. in 2000 to aid development in sub-Saharan Africa, gave Ethiopia duty-free access to the U.S. market for several products.\n\nWith Ethiopian wages much lower than those in China, a country synonymous with manufacturing, and AGOA making it cheaper to import goods to the U.S., many international manufacturing companies set up in Hawassa‚Äôs industrial sheds.\n\nOn January 1, however, the U.S. withdrew Ethiopia‚Äôs access to AGOA due to ‚Äúgross violations of human rights.‚Äù\n\nRights groups have accused the Ethiopian government and its aligned military forces of large-scale human abuses, including ethnic cleansing, against Tigrayans during the country‚Äôs nearly two-year conflict.\n\nTigrayan forces have also been accused of abuses.\n\nThirty-five thousand people worked at Hawassa, but in June, one firm laid off 3,000 workers and others laid off hundreds.\n\nOne factory owner in Hawassa, Raghavendra Pattar, said the country is struggling to adapt.\n\n\"We are forging towards a new market, but it will take more time to roll up the market again, so that‚Äôs why we are suffering a lot,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe country is suffering because of foreign currency availability in the country today. They also need support from other countries, big countries, like America.‚Äù\n\nThe deputy general manager of the park, Belante Tebikew, said the withdrawal of AGOA was causing more problems than the pandemic or inflation.\n\n‚ÄúThere are some, as I told you, reductions on orders, because they are being injured by the customs, duty-free privileges in the American markets, since most of the commodities are being exported to the U.S.,‚Äù he said.\n\nIn another bad sign for the country‚Äôs economy, fighting between government and Tigrayan rebel forces broke out again in late August after a five-month cease-fire.",

Parliament early this year reportedly approved an additional $1.7 billion budget for defense.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, a drone strike hit a university campus in Tigray‚Äôs capital, Mekele, causing an unknown number of injuries, according to a media worker there who spoke on condition of anonymity because he didn‚Äôt have authorization to speak to other outlets. He said another drone strike also destroyed the station of regional broadcaster Dimtsi Woyane.\n\nEthiopian officials continue to paint a rosy picture for the country of well over 110 million people. ‚ÄúOur economy has continued to grow amid natural and man-made problems,‚Äù the planning and development minister, Fitsum Assefa, said earlier this month.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut the Ethiopian Economic Association‚Äôs meeting this month made clear the country is hurting, while international mediators urgently seek progress on talks to end the fighting.\n\nBecause of internal conflicts, the destruction of infrastructure and uncontrolled spending are hurting the economy while ordinary Ethiopians face weakening incomes and rising poverty, economist Alemayehu Seyoum told the meeting.\n\nEthiopia once seared into the global consciousness with a devastating famine in the 1980s. The country has since transformed its economy with mega-projects like the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, the largest in Africa, and large-scale construction projects in Addis Ababa, Africa‚Äôs diplomatic capital.\n\nThe economy grew at an average of 11% over the past decade.\n\nBut the war in the northern Tigray region, which began in late 2020, has caused immense disruption. In June, the International Monetary Fund said growth likely fell to 3.8% for 2021-2022 because of the war and a ‚Äúsharp fall in donor financing,‚Äù among other factors.\n\nThe finance ministry has declined to approve the financing of three industrial parks, symbols of Ethiopia‚Äôs China-like development, citing ‚Äúbudgetary pressure.‚Äù\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nInstead, the economy has shifted to a war focus.\n\nThe finance ministry now pleads with the public and Ethiopia‚Äôs large diaspora to contribute to a ‚Äúnational cause‚Äù for war reconstruction and aid. Ethiopia‚Äôs National Bank introduced changes to give the government all possible access to foreign currency, including requiring foreign residents to convert all in their possession upon entry.\n\nCertain development works continue, including Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed‚Äôs flagship projects like the beautification of the capital.\n\nBut some critics such as the spokesman for the outlawed Oromo Liberation Army, Odaa Tarbii, say ‚Äúvanity projects‚Äù are not necessary now.\n\nAnything seen as criticism of the war can be stifled. Last week, authorities blocked 31 local civil society groups from organizing a media briefing calling for peace.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFollowing criticism that its financial support was enabling the government‚Äôs war efforts, the World Bank last week said it will continue its partnership but expressed concern.\n\nSome state-run sectors of Ethiopia‚Äôs economy continue to open to investors, as Abiy promised after taking office. The cabinet this month approved the entry of foreign banks, a significant step.\n\nEthiopia‚Äôs ambassador to the United States, Seleshi Bekele, said the ‚Äúinternational community should support this initiative by helping to disarm the hostile (Tigray forces).‚Äù\n\nU.S. special envoy Mike Hammer was again in Ethiopia last week to ‚Äúdiscuss the urgency of immediate cessation of hostilities,‚Äù according to the State Department, which said ‚Äúthe Ethiopian people have suffered tremendously from this conflict.‚Äù\n\nEthiopia‚Äôs government was unsettled when the U.S. last year removed it from a preferential trade program over its failure to end the war in Tigray that the U.S. said led to ‚Äúgross violations‚Äù of human rights.

The airline has denied it.\n\nInside Tigray, millions of residents are still largely cut off from the world. Communications and banking services are severed, and their restoration has been a key demand in mediation efforts.\n\nAn agricultural survey conducted in several accessible parts of Tigray last month by Mekele University personnel, shared with The Associated Press, found many crops were failing because of the lack of fertilizer. Even traveling had become ‚Äútiresome‚Äù because of the lack of fuel, the survey said.\n\nOther shortages are deadly.

The electricity at Ayder Referral Hospital had been cut for weeks, hospital head Kibrom Gebreselassie said. Medical and fuel supplies were dwindling. Doctors and nurses had been working without pay for 16 months.\n\nBut an uneasy peace in Ethiopia‚Äôs civil war had meant that, at least since March, the flow of wounded had paused. Then last week, an airstrike that residents and local media blamed on the Ethiopian government ripped through a kindergarten. Gebreselassie said four people, including two children, were declared dead on arrival at the hospital. As staff at the Ayder hospital rushed to treat more than a dozen victims, he said, they were forced to forgo care for their regular cancer, kidney and cardiac patients.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n‚ÄúWe cannot keep up,‚Äù said Gebreselassie, a 44-year-old surgeon.\n\nNearly two years into Ethiopia‚Äôs devastating civil war, which has left millions in Tigray on the brink of famine, intense fighting has resumed between government forces, led by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, and the Tigray People‚Äôs Liberation Front (TPLF). The extent of the violence, which has included two airstrikes in the area of the regional capital, Mekelle, has dashed hopes for peace talks between the two sides.\n\nEach side blames the other for launching the attacks. In a statement about the airstrike, the Ethiopian government said that its Air Force only targets military sites and accused the TPLF of ‚Äúdumping fake body bags in civilian areas.‚Äù\n\nLeft to suffer are the 5.5 million people living in Tigray, where the Ethiopian government has largely cut off communication and banking services, restricted access for journalists and limited fuel distribution. About 9 in 10 Tigrayans are in need of food aid, according to a recent U.N. report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt Ayder, the main hospital in Mekelle, food supplies have mostly come from nonprofits operating in the area, according to Gebreselassie, who said he has not been able to see his wife in Addis Ababa for more than a year and that his relatives in Mekelle are going hungry. He said the food supply has been sporadic, and staff have at times struggled to have enough food to feed the patients. Even though many staff members are themselves going hungry, Gebreselassie said, they have continued coming to work.\n\n‚ÄúSiege is a slow killer,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúslowly you lose your loved ones, slowly you see people starving to death or losing hope.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhen there is active fighting on top of the blockade, he added, ‚Äúit is disastrous for civilians and everybody.‚Äù\n\nEthiopia had once been a source of stability in the Horn of Africa, and a partner to the West. But the nation of 113 million, has also long been riven by ethnic divisions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe TPLF, a guerrilla group from the country‚Äôs mountainous north composed mostly of ethnic Tigrayans, was welcomed by many Ethiopians after it seized power in 1991 from an oppressive Marxist regime. But over decades in government, the TPLF suppressed many of Ethiopia‚Äôs larger ethnic groups, including the Amhara and Oromo. Abiy, who is half Amhara and half Oromo, was heralded as a liberalizing figure when he came to power in 2018 and was awarded the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize for brokering peace with neighboring Eritrea.\n\nWhat began as a political dispute between his government and the TPLF turned violent in the fall of 2020, when the TPLF attacked an Ethiopian military base in Tigray ‚Äî the Tigrayans called it a preemptive strike ‚Äî and Abiy launched a military offensive in Tigray. Abiy has framed the war as ‚Äúexistential‚Äù and referred to the TPLF as ‚Äúweeds‚Äù and ‚Äúcancer‚Äù that must be eliminated. Both sides have committed atrocities, according to a U.N. report last year, including executions and mass rapes.\n\nDespite pressure from Western countries, peace talks have made little progress. In a news conference Tuesday, TPLF spokesman Getachew Reda said Abiy‚Äôs government was able to ‚Äúhoodwink the international community‚Äù into believing they were serious about peace. The Ethiopian government on Wednesday accused the TPLF of launching an invasion in the direction of Sudan‚Äôs border, and the TPLF on Thursday claimed the government and Eritrean troops had launched a ‚Äúmassive‚Äù offensive against Tigray.\n\n‚ÄúThe escalation risks the situation spiraling out of control,‚Äù said William Davison, an analyst with the International Crisis Group. ‚ÄúIt is all a major setback to a peace process that was already struggling.‚Äù\n\nAdvertisement\n\nActions taken by both sides, including allegations that the Tigray authorities stole fuel from the World Food Program, make it unlikely that the federal government will end an effective blockade anytime soon, he said.\n\nWhen the airstrike occurred last week, three loud booms rang out and an aid worker named Liwam and her co-workers scurried into their office for shelter. She said her mind went blank as she realized what was happening. Then she thought of her family and three children.\n\nAfter about an hour, Liwam, who asked to be identified by her middle name because her job does not allow her to speak to media, headed to the scene of the airstrike at RES Kids Paradise. The nursery school near her home was closed for the summer, she said, but its playground filled every day with children clamoring over its colorful play sets. What Liwam said she found were medical workers loading injured children into ambulances. Women crying as they looked for their own children. Blood everywhere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the images she said she cannot get out of her head is that of two children killed in the strike, their bodies charred.\n\n‚ÄúFor the siege and blockage, why let us die in front of everyone?,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúOur national government is telling us, either die or accept ‚Ä¶ Is our living of no interest to the government?‚Äù\n\nTewelde Legesse, a popular entertainment reporter from Tigray who fled to a neighboring country after war broke out, was sitting with friends when he got a message on WhatsApp that there had been an airstrike near his hometown.

She was telling the local television station she could not find her children.\n\nHe wanted desperately to call her but couldn‚Äôt.

The OLA denied the allegation and called for an independent investigation.\n\nThe rapid uptick in violence in what Human Rights Watch calls Ethiopia‚Äôs ‚Äúother conflict‚Äù has led some to question whether it constitutes a second civil war for the country.\n\nInformation from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project shows that from August 2021 to July 2022, there were 3,784 deaths linked to the OLA, compared with 651 the previous year.\n\nFuel for insurgency\n\nWilliam Davison, an analyst with International Crisis Group, a Belgium-based research organization, said the increased violence is the result of long-standing grievances related to Oromo self-determination and lack of political representation in Ethiopia‚Äôs federal system, especially since the current government came to power in 2018.\n\n‚ÄúI think that added fuel to the Oromo Liberation Army insurgency, after a failure to reintegrate those fighters and their rebellion,‚Äù Davison said.\n\nThe Oromo are the largest ethnic group in the country.\n\nDavison was asked if the conflict is as significant as Ethiopia‚Äôs headline-grabbing war with Tigrayan rebels in the north of the country.\n\n‚ÄúIt probably doesn‚Äôt immediately threaten the regional government authority in Adama or the federal government authority in Addis Ababa,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbut it is affecting a huge number of people in Oromia, as well as leading to direct violence that‚Äôs killing combatants and civilians.‚Äù\n\nFor now, Gambella is calm, but less than 10 kilometers beyond its outskirts, there are regular firefights with the OLA, local police say.\n\nLocal officials are keen to project stability. Chankot Chote, head of the Gambella Regional State Peace and Security Office, said that with the help of the special forces, federal police and regular police, and the community, the situation has improved. He added that although the OLA is trying to attack on the outskirts of town, it will never enter the city again.\n\nThe OLA is an offshoot of another rebel group, the Oromo Liberation Front, which signed a peace deal with the Ethiopian government in 2018.\n\nEditor‚Äôs note: The story has been updated to include attribution and a reaction from the Oromo Liberation Army on the killing of ethnic Amharas in the Oromia region.",
    "Ethiopia Drought Response July - December 2022 (Revised) - Ethiopia": "Crisis Overview\n\nThe first reiteration of the Drought Response Plan was developed in April 2022 as an extract of the Ethiopia Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) for 2022 using the information available at the time. By the end of June more data became available indicating the worsening drought conditions and expansion to other regions. This revised plan takes in consideration the new data available and expand the scope of the response to the new areas affected by the drought and reviews the response strategy and resources needed to respond to the growing needs until the end of the year. It is expected that the situation will continue to evolve over the next few months. This plan will serve to organize and monitor the drought response until the end of 2022. This drought response plan is an integral part of the Ethiopia HRP 2022 and will be integrated with the HRP mid-year review to be carried out in August.\n\nA worsening and expanding drought over the last few months expected to continue in the coming months ‚Äì Following four consecutive failed rainy seasons in parts of Ethiopia, the drought impact has continued to worsen and expand over the last few months with more areas affected, notably in Afar.\n\nRecent weather forecasts point towards a higher likelihood that the upcoming deyr/hageya rainy season (October ‚Äì December 2022) will also be below-average, making it an unprecedented fifth consecutive failed rainy season. Already, owing to the revised methodology used for revising this plan to strengthen the identification of drought-affected areas, the number of affected woredas increased from 157 in the first iteration of the Drought Response Plan to 391 by the end of June.\n\nAt present, there are 16.99 million who will be targeted for multi-sector lifesaving assistance for the rest of the year. This is an increase from 8.1 million people targeted in the last iteration of the Drought Response Plan, more than doubling of the affected population identified at the beginning of the year.\n\nOver the recent years, drought-affected pastoralist and agro-pastoralist communities in southern and eastern Ethiopia have suffered from the impact of multiple and often recurring shocks. In addition to four back-to-back failed rainy seasons since late 2020 (the worst in the last 40 years), these communities have endured the impact of desert locust infestations, conflict and disease outbreaks, including COVID-19 pandemic and previous droughts episodes notably in 2017 and 2011. Likewise, the expansion and continuation of the drought has not only affected more people, it has also increased significantly the severity of their needs and eroded any remaining resilience mechanisms almost completely. In addition, the drought has expanded to areas that have also been affected by conflict in Northern Ethiopia, notably in Afar region, or violence in other part of the country, notably in Oromia and SNNP regions, subjecting affecting people to increase vulnerability.\n\nThe impact of the drought on the livelihoods of affected communities is already devastating and is expected to further worsen in the second half of 2022 increasing the severity of needs. Recent weather forecasts point towards a higher likelihood that the upcoming deyr/ hageya rainy season (October ‚Äì December 2022) will also be below-average, making it an unprecedented fifth consecutive failed rainy season. The drought impact continued to worsen and to expand over the last few months with more areas affected, notably in 9,788 Afar. According to the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET), ‚Äúpasture conditions are among the driest on record, with few to no migration options. implementing response activities. Subsequently, an estimated 3.5 million livestock have died between late 2021 and mid-May 2022, and herd sizes are likely to decline further given very limited livestock births this season and high offtake expected during the upcoming dry season.\" An additional 25 million weakened and emaciated livestock are also at risk of deaths, which is a devastation for a population heavily reliant on livestock for nutrition, notably for children, and income.\n\nDue to the limited food and milk availability for children, coupled with poor health and limited or no health and nutrition services, acute malnutrition rate amongst children has surpassed the emergency threshold in most areas. According to FEWS NET, ‚ÄúCrisis (IPC Phase 3) and Emergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes exist across southern and southeastern areas, and there is a risk of more extreme outcomes ‚Äì marked by Extremely Critical levels of acute malnutrition and high levels of hunger-related mortality ‚Äì without sustained, large-scale assistance.‚Äù At present, around 9.9 million people require food assistance and 2.9 million children and pregnant and lactating women require nutrition interventions until the end of the year. The level of water scarcity is alarming for both livestock and human consumption. Surface water continues to dry up, while groundwater levels continue to decrease, and the population is traveling longer distances to reach water points. More than 13 million people need WASH assistance in drought affected areas.\n\nThe risk of gender-based violence (GBV) has also increased as women and girls are forced to travel far distances to fetch water, while in other cases they are often left alone while family members are away looking for food or livelihood. Recent inter-sectoral assessments show an increase in psychosocial distress, especially among children and caregivers, and negative survival strategies. Child labor, street begging and an increase in the number of school dropouts and early marriage cases were observed in drought-affected areas. Cases of family separation and of serious neglect of children, older persons and persons with disability were reported as well.\n\nRecent inter-sectoral assessments show an increase in psychosocial distress, especially among children and caregivers, as well as in the resort to negative survival strategies. Child labor, street begging and an increase in the number of school dropouts and early marriage cases were observed in drought-affected areas. Based on Government data and UNICEF Analysis (May 2022), the number of child marriage cases has increased by 264 per cent in Somali, by 69 per cent in Oromia and by 38 per cent in SNNP ‚Äì all regions severely affected by drought ‚Äì compared to the same period (January- April) last year. Cases of family separation and of serious neglect of children, older persons and persons with disability were reported as well.\n\nWith the worsening conditions, hundreds and thousands of people continue to migrate in search of water, pasture, and assistance. leaving behind their elderly and sick family members. Further movements are anticipated in the months to come as the drought is expected to progress. Movement of communities heightens the risk of disease transmission (both for humans and livestock) due to high population concentration and weakened immunity. The longer the drought condition persists, the weaker they become exposing them to illnesses, including water-borne and skin diseases. The education of 1.4 million children has also been disrupted due to migration, school closure or sickness.",
    "Aid halted to Ethiopia's Tigray, UN says, as fighting escalates": "Ethiopia's northernmost region has been suffering from severe food shortages and limited access to basic services\n\nAddis Ababa (AFP) ‚Äì Renewed clashes in northern Ethiopia have forced desperately needed aid deliveries to a halt in war-torn Tigray, the United Nations said, as fighting escalated Thursday between Tigrayan rebels and pro-government forces.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nThe resumption of combat last month shattered a March truce and sparked international concern, with frantic diplomatic efforts now under way to find a peaceful resolution to the nearly two-year war.\n\nThe truce had allowed aid convoys to travel to Tigray's capital Mekele for the first time since mid-December.\n\nBut in its first situation report since clashes broke out on August 24, the UN's humanitarian agency OCHA said the violence was \"already impacting the lives and livelihood of vulnerable people, including the delivery of lifesaving humanitarian assistance\".\n\n\"The last humanitarian convoy to enter Tigray before the interruption was the humanitarian convoy on 23 August consisting of 158 trucks with humanitarian and operational supplies,\" the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said late Wednesday.\n\nIt said twice-weekly UN humanitarian flights between Addis Ababa and Mekele have also come to a halt since August 26.\n\nFighting erupted around Tigray's southeastern border, but has since spread along the region's southern border to areas west and north of the initial clashes.\n\n#photo1\n\nA diplomatic source and a foreign source, who spoke to AFP on condition of anonymity, said fighting had intensified along Tigray's northern border, with pro-government forces and troops from neighbouring Eritrea -- which backed Ethiopia's army in the early stages of the war -- targeting rebel positions.\n\nBoth sources described heavy artillery fire near Adigrat, a town in northern Tigray not far from the Eritrean border.\n\nThere is \"intense shelling from Eritrea into the Adigrat area, around the border\", said the diplomatic source.

    "Ethiopia: Humanitarian crisis fuels hardship for people with disabilities in Afar": "Getachew Gesese sits on a cemented edge of a flower bed, under a flagpole in front of a hotel in Semera, the capital of Afar region in Ethiopia. Next to him is his friend, Shegaw Ababu. A friend with whom he shares a similar disability and challenges. They have both lost their ability to walk. A dog with its ribs running against its belly like a bell stares at them with its tongue out of its mouth, as they beg for money from passersby.\n\nGetachew is a 20-year-old man who lives in Logia, a small town 10km outside of Semera. He lost his ability to walk 10 years ago. The condition forced him to abandon school and his dream of becoming an orthodox priest ‚Äì in a region where over 95% of the population is muslim.\n\n\"When it started, I felt severe cramps and difficulty stretching my legs,\" says Getachew.\n\nAlthough his mother massaged his legs for months with traditional herbs, Getachew's condition got worse, and he could no longer walk. He did not seek medical diagnosis and treatment because his family could not afford it.\n\n\"Everybody also said there is no treatment for it,\" he adds.\n\nWith his physical disability, Getachew says he cannot get a job. He lives in a poor neighbourhood in Logia and depends on donations from people on the streets for survival. In the past, he could make 700 Ethiopian Birr on a good day. But since the war in northern Ethiopia spread to Afar region in 2021, he hardly makes 200 Birr. Some days, there is nothing to eat at home. And on several occasions, his landlord has thrown him out of the one room he rents ‚Äì for days - and then will feel pity for him and allow him to stay without paying.\n\n\"It's tough now, especially for us who cannot walk,\" says Getachew.\n\nThe humanitarian needs in Afar are huge. Many people living with disabilities do not have access to medical services. There is no functional physical rehabilitation center in the region to provide full services to persons with special needs. The conflicts and violence in neighbouring Tigray, Amhara, Somali and Oromia regions have made it even more difficult for patients to access care elsewhere.\n\nOur region is different because it is facing a severe humanitarian situation from four conflicts\n\nsays Ali Zeinu, head of Afar's social affairs bureau.\n\nAt Dubti Referral Hospital ‚Äì the largest in the region ‚Äì doctors say the hospital is strained because of the dire humanitarian situation exacerbated by the different armed conflicts in neighbouring regions. Patients are being treated on beds in the hospital's corridors and several others are in queues waiting to be seen by medical staff. Among them are persons with different forms of physical disabilities. Some of them lost their legs and arms in the conflicts.\n\n\"Many patients with physical rehabilitation needs come here. Most of them are from very distant and remote areas. We can only provide basic services because we do not have the resources. We need assistance to improve our physiotherapy services,\" explains Dr. Hussein Aden, Chief Executive Officer of Dubti Referral Hospital. According to him, the hospital lacks equipment and is seriously understaffed. It also lacks critical services like mental health and ophthalmology.\n\nThe region also faces a food crisis. There is not enough food for people to eat. The influx of displaced people from nearby regions has added to the number of people who cannot access food. Malnutrition cases are rising. At a makeshift feeding centre in Dubti hospital, dozens of children and adults are getting therapeutic support for malnutrition and its complications. At the Mille Primary Health Center, which is some 60km on the outskirts of Semera, health experts weigh dozens of malnourished children at a nutrition center before providing them with essential therapeutic nutrition. Some of them arrive in desperate conditions.\n\nThe food shortage has left some people with no choice but to eat the seeds of certain legumes (genus lathyrus) that have irreversible health consequences ‚Äì including permanent disability. Like many other people in the region, Getachew suffers from neurolathyrism ‚Äì a lasting lower limbs paralysis condition caused by eating certain legumes, as diagnosed by physiotherapists from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), after screening patients in Afar region in August 2022.\n\n\"I ate guaya (grass pea). Three days after, I started having cramps, fatigue and difficulty stretching my legs,\" recalls Getachew.\n\nThe ICRC team's outreach activity was the first in the region for persons with disabilities. A total of 104 patients were screened in Logia, Mille, Dubti and Semera. Twelve of the patients were diagnosed with neurolathyrism as the underlying cause of their disability ‚Äì including Getachew's 29-year-old friend, Shegaw.\n\nShegaw, 29, lost his ability to walk 10 years ago. Without medical care, he finds it very hard to cope with the disability.\n\n\n\nBut since meeting our physical rehabilitation team in Logia, he is hopeful his condition will get better. He is among 104 patients screened in #Afar region pic.twitter.com/hlde7f7NtW ‚Äî ICRC Ethiopia (@ICRCEthiopia) September 7, 2022\n\n\"Looking at the number of neurolathyrism cases and the age range of the patients, their condition is likely linked to the food crisis in Ethiopia in the 1980s that forced people to eat certain legumes, knowing the health consequences. The Afar region, where we identified these patients, and the eastern Amhara region were severely affected by this food insecurity,\" explains Venkatakannan Packirisamy, ICRC's Physical Rehabilitation Project Manager in Ethiopia. \"The current food situation needs timely action to prevent many more people from being pushed into this irreversible health condition. Apart from the acute social and health-related consequences, the food insecurity leaves a longer-term legacy in terms of disability and productivity of the affected population.\"\n\nLike Getachew, most of the people living with disabilities in Afar have never had the chance to consult a medical doctor or physiotherapist.\n\n\"This [screening by the ICRC team] is my first time to meet a medical professional,\" says Shegaw. \"If I can be treated, I'll be very happy to walk again.\"\n\nAfter the screening, the ICRC team provided immediate support that included crutches to 61 patients on the spot, while 13 others were registered to receive wheelchairs to aid their mobility. Severe cases were referred to the physical rehabilitation center in Dessie, Amhara region, supported by the ICRC and to hospitals in the capital Addis Ababa, where they will receive free treatment.",

    "Conflict in Ethiopia: UK Minister for Africa's statement": "Commenting on the breakdown of the cessation of hostilities in Ethiopia, the Minister for Africa said:\n\nThe return to conflict between the Tigray People‚Äôs Liberation Front ( TPLF ) and the Ethiopian Government is catastrophic for the people of Ethiopia. This development risks tens of thousands of deaths ‚Äì both directly through fighting, and indirectly through a further deepening of the already dire humanitarian situation. 22 months since fighting first began, it is clear that there is no military solution.\n\nThe cessation of hostilities agreed in March 2022 created an opportunity to resolve this conflict politically and enable Ethiopia to return to sustained development and economic growth. The resumption of fighting makes the path to peace much more difficult. Tigrayan forces should immediately cease fighting in Amhara region and return to Tigray. Eritrean forces should leave Tigray. We remain confident that progress towards peace can be made if talks begin.\n\nThe conflict in northern Ethiopia has contributed to one of the world‚Äôs worst humanitarian crises, leaving 13 million people in Tigray, Amhara and Afar requiring humanitarian assistance. Conflict, and the TPLF ‚Äôs seizure of fuel from the World Food Programme, makes the work of humanitarian agencies more difficult. The UK urges all parties to the conflict to guarantee unfettered humanitarian access by immediately ceasing hostilities. The UK calls on the Ethiopian Government to urgently restore services to Tigray and the TPLF to enable the seized fuel to be used for aid distribution and critical services.\n\nPrevious phases of the conflict were marked by terrible violations and abuses of human rights, including sexual violence. The UK will strongly support all efforts to ensure accountability for violations and abuses, including by the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission and the International Commission of Human Rights Experts on Ethiopia. There have already been reports of airstrikes on Tigray by the Ethiopian Government resulting in civilian casualties, and of ethnically targeted arrests. It is the responsibility of all parties to the conflict to prioritise the protection of civilians, respect human rights and uphold International Humanitarian Law.\n\nThe only way to resolve this conflict is to reinstate the cessation of hostilities and immediately begin political negotiations. We support the African Union‚Äôs mediation efforts to this end, and urge a redoubling of these efforts to avert further escalation.",
    "USAID‚Äôs response to unprecedented drought in the Horn of Africa - Ethiopia": "Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia are facing the most severe food security crises in the world right now. Find out how USAID is working to save lives.\n\nA Historic Drought and its Impacts\n\nThe worst drought in at least 70 years is devastating the Horn of Africa, a region encompassing the East African countries of Ethiopia, Somalia, and Kenya. This region has seen catastrophic drought before, most recently in 2016-2017, as well as in 2010-2011, when hundreds of thousands of people died of hunger.\n\nWhat makes the current drought different, however, is its duration. While previous droughts were the result of two or three consecutive failed rainy seasons, the Horn recently experienced four back-to-back seasons of poor rainfall since late 2020‚Äìsomething that has never happened before. This means that for nearly two years now, herders have been losing livestock without even a moment of reprieve and farmers haven‚Äôt been able to produce anywhere near the amount of food needed to feed their families or their communities.\n\nTo complicate matters, many families are still reeling from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, desert locusts, and haven't fully recovered from the 2016-2017 drought. Humanitarian actors warn that things could get even worse in the coming months, with an unprecedented fifth failed rainy season expected to take place in late 2022.\n\nNow, more than 20 million people across Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia require emergency food assistance according to the UN; many communities lack access to reliable water sources; and a growing number of people are abandoning their homes to make long and dangerous journeys in search of food, water, and grazing lands. Conflict over increasingly scarce water resources is also on the rise, further endangering vulnerable populations.\n\nUSAID‚Äôs Humanitarian Response\n\nAs humanitarian needs continue to grow across the Horn, USAID is stepping up to save lives. USAID‚Äôs Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance has provided more than $1.8 billion in lifesaving humanitarian assistance this fiscal year alone, and more help is on the way. To meet growing needs, USAID partners are delivering food and water, treating malnourished children and pregnant women, repairing wells, and preventing disease outbreaks in vulnerable communities. Take a look at where and how USAID is helping.\n\nETHIOPIA\n\nDry weather has struck southern and southeastern Ethiopia‚Äôs Oromiya and Somali regions particularly hard. Overall, drought has affected 24.1 million people countrywide, 8.2 million of whom are facing water shortages. Water pumps, wells, and canals in many villages lie in a state of disrepair due to intense bouts of dry weather and conflict in recent years. People in these areas are having to choose between drinking water or using it for cooking or hygiene purposes. This often leads to deadly disease outbreaks in communities where immune systems have been ravaged by malnutrition.\n\nUSAID is working with more than 20 partners across Ethiopia to meet urgent humanitarian needs. In one project, USAID partner GOAL is constructing water points, pipelines, and storage tanks in Oromiya Region‚Äôs West Guji Zone‚Äìan area that has some of the worst water infrastructure in Ethiopia due to recent conflict. Meanwhile, our partner Save the Children is repairing village wells and installing rainwater harvesting systems at health centers in Ethiopia‚Äôs Oromiya and Somali regions.\n\nKENYA\n\nIn Kenya, drought-related food and nutrition needs have reached startling levels in the northern counties of Marsabit, Mandera, and Wajir. Across the country, approximately 2.4 million livestock have died due to water shortages and drying pasture lands as of August. These animals were the primary source of income and food for many households. Crucially, they also produced the milk that is a key source of nutrition for many children. As of August 2022, nearly 885,000 children under the age of 5 required urgent treatment for malnutrition.\n\nUSAID and its partners are helping communities in arid and semi-arid areas across Kenya cope with the worst effects of the drought. In Mandera county, USAID partner the Rural Agency for Community Development and Assistance (RACIDA) is screening and treating children for malnutrition in some of the region‚Äôs most remote villages. The NGO is also providing immunizations and vitamin supplements to enable these children to fight off life-threatening illnesses. To boost incomes and production of nutritious dairy products RACIDA has also dewormed and vaccinated hundreds of thousands of livestock in recent months.\n\nSOMALIA\n\nMore than 90 percent of Somalia is experiencing severe drought, but food security conditions are particularly dire in central and southern parts of the country, including the Bay Region. Between October and December of this year, 6.7 million people are expected to require lifesaving emergency food aid, and more than 300,000 are likely to face catastrophic levels of food insecurity‚Äìincluding people at risk of famine in Bay‚Äôs Buur Hakaba and Baidoa districts‚Äìunless emergency food assistance is expanded dramatically in the coming months.\n\nSix USAID partners are delivering food to meet needs that haven‚Äôt been seen in Somalia in decades. In July alone, the UN World Food Program (WFP), with support from USAID and other donors, delivered food to 3.7 million people in Somalia. WFP is also scaling up its food programming at sites in Bay Region and near Mogadishu that have received tens of thousands of people fleeing drought in recent weeks.\n\nThis is not just another drought in the Horn of Africa. This is a perfect storm of factors resulting in catastrophic levels of humanitarian need and long-term protracted impacts. Persistent malnutrition, high vulnerability to droughts, and the effects of climate shocks are increasing the challenges faced by vulnerable communities across Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia. As the largest single humanitarian donor to the Horn of Africa, the United States has stepped up to meet the majority of immediate funding gaps to save lives. We are committed to the people living in the Horn, but we cannot solve this crisis alone. We now need other donors to step up and join us in alleviating suffering for millions of people and prevent more lives from being lost.\n\nLearn more about how USAID‚Äôs Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance provides lifesaving aid around the world.\n\nIf you would like to learn more about how you can help people affected by the drought in the Horn of Africa, the Center for International Disaster Information has more information and great tips.\n\nGet updates on our response efforts by following USAID‚Äôs Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.",
