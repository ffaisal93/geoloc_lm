I think we have about 7-8 million in stock at the moment, and with the others I told you about, we will probably reach a consistent figure. If we're talking about 15 million vaccine doses, it's probably EUR 100-200 million, I can't tell you exactly,\" Rafila told local news channel Antena 3, News.ro reported.\n\nMinister Rafila also said that, under the contract, Romania is still to receive millions of COVID-19 vaccine doses.\n\n\"It's a delicate situation, I personally tried to find a solution. Beyond appetite, there are some contractual obligations. This year we are going to receive about 11.2 million doses of vaccine, and next year about 19 million doses of vaccine. This is the contractual provision. […] I had discussions with the Commission and the producers. I hope, and we are on the verge of obtaining a reduction of about 80% of this year's contract, and the vaccine that should come to Romania should be with the new formula,\" Alexandru Rafila said.\n\nAbout a month ago, the health minister said Romania has 8 million COVID-19 vaccine doses that it might have to destroy once they expire as neither the population nor other countries are interested in them.\n\nirina.marica@romania-insider.com\n\n(Photo source: Facebook/Ministerul Sanatatii)",

As part of its partnership with CNN International Commercial, Antena 3 will also have more access to CNN reporting and content for usage in its output.\n\nCNN adds that the move builds on the success that Antena 3 has seen with News Hour with CNN – a show exec-produced by CNN, which has become the most watched news show in its time slot and grown market share for that slot by over 30% since its launch in May 2021.\n\nBy enhancing the editorial capabilities of its affiliate, CNN will also have greater reciprocal access to Antena 3’s content at a time when CNN is extensively covering Central and Eastern Europe and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.\n\nThe new channel will be inaugurated at a launch event at the Royal Palace in Bucharest on September 26 with a signing ceremony between Rani Raad, president, CNN Worldwide Commercial, and Mihai Gadea, CEO of Antena 3.\n\nCommenting on the re-launch, Raad said: “From the very outset of CNN, our strong relationships with affiliate partners have enhanced the editorial footprint and improved the way news is reported by both CNN and our affiliates.\n\n“At this critical moment when the eyes of the world are on Central and Eastern Europe, it is important for CNN to have a strong partner in Romania as we extensively cover news from this region in light of the conflict in Ukraine.

This development is not just a key milestone for Antena 3 but also for Romania and our country’s media industry as we prepare to deliver news that upholds the very highest standards of journalism”.",
    "Romania's Hidroelectrica wants to take over supply firm previously owned by CEZ": "The Board of Romanian state-controlled hydropower company Hidroelectrica green-lighted the bid for electricity supply firm CEZ Vanzare, taken over by the Australian investment fund Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets (MIRA) from Czech group CEZ at the end of 2020, E-nergia.ro announced quoting a company's press release.\n\nThe target company was evaluated by MIRA, at the time it took it over, at EUR 15 mln.\n\nE-nergia.ro reported this spring that the Australian investment fund plans to divest the supply firm and keep the other assets taken over from CEZ.\n\nAt this moment, the Romanian electricity suppliers accuse challenging cash flow problems caused by the Government not paying timely the subsidies.\n\nThe biggest impact on Hidroelectrica's business derives not from the price paid for CEZ Vanzare (supposedly low, considering the market circumstances) but from the subsequent enlargement of its customer base: CEZ Vanzare serves some 75,000 non-residential customers and 1.3 mln residential customers. For comparison, Hidroelectrica serves 21,000 large customers (residential and non-residential) and 0.3 mln residential customers.\n\nThe takeover would make the hydropower group (with a market share of some 30% in normal years) one of the major electricity suppliers as well. At this moment, Hidroelectrica sells electricity to households at the lowest price on the market: just below the cap set by the Government (above which the state provided subsidies to the supply companies).\n\nMIRA took over CEZ Vânzare and all other assets, including a distribution network in the southern part of the country, a wind farm in Dobrogea and micro hydro plants in Caraşi county, from CEZ in a transaction worth RON 4.7 bln (EUR 1 bln).\n\niulian@romania-insider.com\n\n(Photo source: Dreamstime.com)",

    "Romania’s government to speed up major natural gas projects": "Romania’s Minister of Energy Virgil Popescu has signalled that the government will do its best to speed up the two largest natural gas projects – one onshore and the other offshore – which are fully (the onshore project) or partially (offshore) managed by the state-owned company Romgaz.\n\nBoth the Neptun Deep project and the onshore deep Caragele field, which would cover Romania’s gas consumption for a combined period of up to ten years, have been delayed for years while the deadlines have been repeatedly postponed.\n\nFirstly, Popescu expressed hopes that OMV Petrom and Romgaz would announce this year the investment decision related to the extraction phase of Neptun Deep natural gas deposit in the Black Sea, “considering the current context on the gas market”.\n\nPopescu, spoke on September 21 at the Romanian International Gas Conference, organised by the Romanian Oil and Gas Employers' Federation (FPPG).\n\n“I expect and I wish the decision of Romgaz and Petrom to be taken as soon as possible … including by the end of this year. I wish this because there is a special situation in the market. [More] natural gas is needed in the market and Romania can play a role. I think the Offshore Law is clear enough. I believe a decision will be made by the end of this year,\" said the government official.\n\nRomania sweetened the Offshore Law earlier this year and Romgaz took over Exxon Mobile’s 50% stake in the Neptun Deep project, with an estimated reserve of 48bn-84bn cubic meters of natural gas.\n\nSeparately, Popescu said that Romgaz will begin extracting gas from its onshore deep Caragele field in 2024.\n\nDiscovered in 2016 some 100 km from Bucharest, Caragele field was initially supposed to come online in 2019.\n\nTwo years later, in 2018, the deadline was already deferred to 2021-2022.\n\nMore recently, this year, Popescu was speaking of 2023 as the most likely moment for beginning production at Caragele.\n\nThe deposit has an estimated accumulation of gas of roughly 25bn-27bn cubic metres, amounting to the country's entire consumption for up to three years. It was estimated at that time at a value of $4bn, but the natural gas price has tripled meanwhile.\n\nRomgaz owns 100% of the concession contract for the perimeter located in Buzău County.",

The ten CEE countries, Romania among them, could reach a digital economy worth EUR 330 bln by 2030, with digital commerce being the main driver of growth.\n\nRomania’s own digital economy was estimated at EUR 14.8 bln in 2021, or 6% of GDP, in the same report. The value is shared between digital commerce (EUR 9.8 bln), expenditures on ICT (EUR 3.5 bln), and offline spending on digital products like PCs or smartphones (EUR 1.6 bln). McKinsey analysts reckon that the sector could be worth EUR 52 bln (9.6% of GDP) by 2030.\n\nICT showed promise in Romania, growing at around 8% annually between 2017 and 2021. However, investments in this sector are still low when compared to countries such as Poland or Czechia. As Romania’s ICT infrastructure develops, it may become an important driver of growth.\n\nDigital commerce, however, is the clear driver of Romania’s digital economy, representing 66% of it. The segment grew by 17% annually, almost doubling in value between 2017 and 2021. The share of SMEs selling online more than doubled as well, from 7% to 17% in the same period. The spectacular growth transformed Romania into the second largest digital commerce market in the CEE, not to mention the third-largest digital economy.\n\nThere is, however, still room to grow. The average expenditure on digital commerce per capita and the digital commerce penetration rate in Romania are some of the lowest in the region. Romania’s digital commerce per capita was around EUR 506 in 2021, lower than the ones in Czechia (EUR 849), Slovenia (EUR 866), or Lithuania (EUR 1,064). Digital represents just 14% of the total retail segment in Romania, the rest being offline commerce. With 14% penetration, Romania has one of the lowest rates of digital commerce relative to total retail in the CEE.\n\nThe use of innovations delivering ultra-convenience (payments, omnichannel, fast delivery and returns, and data-driven individualization) could help Romania double its digital commerce market size.\n\nThe report shows that the most significant categories for digital commerce in Romania are home goods and electronics (39% share of digital commerce), transportation services (31%), and apparel (14%). However, during the pandemic years, the fastest category growth was seen in groceries, which grew from EUR 123 mln (2% share of digital commerce) in 2019 to EUR 389 mln in 2021 (4% share of digital commerce).\n\nradu@romania-insider.com\n\n(Photo source: Nitsuki | Dreamstime.com)",
    "Rain on the range – Getting muddy with NATO’s multinational battlegroup in Romania": "Earlier this year, Allies agreed to enhance NATO’s presence in the east of the Alliance by establishing four new multinational battlegroups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia (in addition to the existing battlegroups in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, which have been in place since 2017). Now, Allied troops are training together in these new battlegroups, demonstrating their ability and commitment to working together – come rain or come shine.\n\nFrench soldiers observe a live-fire exercise at the new NATO multinational battlegroup in Romania, where they are working alongside their Polish and Romanian counterparts.\n\nFor a soldier, rain is a fact of life.\n\nIt streams from the brim of your Kevlar helmet. It plasters your cold, wet combat uniform to your skin. And it turns the Romanian soil of Cincu Training Area into cake-batter mud that gloms onto your boots and adds a kilogram to every step.\n\nBut for these French soldiers assembled for a live-fire exercise, the rain seemed like an afterthought. They stood outside their armoured personnel carriers, which were parked in a line beside Polish and Romanian infantry fighting vehicles, waiting for the order to move out. Perhaps they’d simply grown used to the weather after several months of being deployed to Romania as part of the NATO Response Force.\n\nThe call came down the line: “Allons-y.” Let’s go. The French, Polish and Romanian soldiers grabbed their rifles and ducked into the cramped confines of their vehicles for the short ride to the gunnery range.\n\nFrench soldiers get into position under cloudy grey skies during a live-fire exercise in Cincu, Romania.\n\nThe French Army – which in 2022 is serving as the lead nation of the highest-readiness element of the NATO Response Force – deployed troops to Romania following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, alongside a contingent of Belgian soldiers. In May, the French and Belgians formally stood up NATO’s first multinational battlegroup in Romania, with a contingent of Dutch soldiers due to arrive in the coming months.\n\nThe battlegroup is backed up by rotational deployments of US and Polish mechanised infantry elements – including troops from the US Army’s 2nd Cavalry Regiment, forward deployed from Vilseck, Germany, and the Polish Army’s 17th Mechanised Brigade. While not under direct NATO command, these units greatly enhance the Alliance’s defensive posture while giving their troops invaluable time to cross-train with their Allies.\n\nPolish soldiers hold positions following a live-fire exercise in Cincu, Romania.\n\nAs the French, Polish and Romanian armoured vehicles raced towards the firing line underneath dark, woolly clouds, it was hard to shake the sense that this felt different from your standard exercise – the gloomy sky matched the mood of the continent, where Russia’s war against Ukraine has shattered peace and created the biggest security crisis in Europe since the Second World War.\n\nThe vehicles came to a halt and opened fire at simulated targets downrange, the .50-calibre machine gun mounted on the French armoured personnel carrier chattering against the deeper chug-chug-chug of the 30-millimeter autocannons mounted on the Polish and Romanian vehicles. After laying down a blanket of suppressing fire, the hatches opened and the soldiers spilled out, sprinting towards their firing positions.\n\nFor a few minutes, every rifle on the firing line was sending rounds downrange, soldiers pausing only to change magazines. Combined with sustained cannon fire from the infantry fighting vehicles, the volume of firepower was deafening. When it was over, the only sound was the voices of French, Polish and Romanian platoon leaders confirming over the radios that they’d spent all their ammunition. The soldiers mounted up and headed back to camp on the groan of diesel engines.\n\nA soldier with the French Army’s 93rd Mountain Artillery Regiment crawls under a barbed wire obstacle in Cincu, Romania. Troops go through a wide variety of physical tests and training in NATO multinational battlegroups, in addition to live-fire exercises.\n\nAlong with the other new battlegroups in Bulgaria, Hungary and Slovakia, NATO’s multinational battlegroup in Romania is a tangible manifestation of how European security has changed since February. While Allied soldiers routinely deployed to Romania in the past for training exercises, their permanent presence comes with a palpable sense of gravity.\n\n“In the first week of the deployment, we felt that it was a very important historical moment,” said Lieutenant Colonel Adrien, deputy commander of the battlegroup. He had deployed with the first French forces activated as part of the NATO Response Force.\n\n“We also felt the responsibility that we had as leaders of this spearhead battalion,” he explained, “the responsibility that we have to demonstrate our capabilities to be ready, totally, with our Allies to fulfil the mission that we have been given.”\n\nNATO troops from across the Alliance have continued to arrive at all four new battlegroups over the past several months, as they carry out the process of being set up and integrated into NATO’s military command structure. No matter where they’re from or where they’re deployed, these soldiers will stand side-by-side with their Allies and live, work and train in the toughest conditions – whether there are blue skies or grey skies ahead.",

    "EC wants energy reduction measures, Romania’s already lowest in Europe": "The average Romanian consumed 2.7 MWh in 2020, placing the country last in a ranking measuring energy consumption per capita in Europe.\n\nBy comparison, Ukraine’s average per capita energy consumption in the same year stood at 2.8 MWh, while Germans consumed 6.4 MWh per inhabitant in the same period. These values pale in comparison with the champions of per capita energy use in Europe, namely Norway (23.3 MWh) and Iceland (51 MWh), both outside the EU.\n\nOther figures serve to further contextualize Romania’s energy climate. The country’s energy consumption dropped by 19.48% since 1990, and its CO2 emissions by 58.33% in the same period, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\n“95% of Romania’s energy consumption in the ‘90s was industrial, households accounting for the rest,” energy and infrastructure analyst Otilia Nuţu told ZF. Energy consumption is especially low in the countryside, the least developed areas in Romania, she says.\n\nLast week, the European Commission unveiled a series of “exceptional electricity demand reduction measures” meant to reduce the cost of electricity throughout the winter. The Commission hopes to tackle high energy prices brought about by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent energy crisis.\n\nOne of the measures will have states reduce electricity consumption by at least 5% during selected peak price hours. Member states will also have to reduce overall electricity demand by at least 10% until March 31, 2023.\n\n“Our problem is that we don’t even have the data. We don’t know how energy is consumed in Romania. We have the same production method, with very large units, close to the old former industrial units, while our consumption has moved to the urban area,” Nuţu says.\n\nDespite massive deindustrialization, households only take up around 25% of the energy consumed in Romania, while the European average stands at 27%. Few devices using electricity have made their way to the country’s rural households, something which can translate into something akin to an advantage in the coming period.\n\nradu@romania-insider.com\n\n(Photo source: prudencio_alvarez | dreamstime.com)",

These are the territories of other countries,” he said.\n\nMarga added that at present, the conflict could only be resolved through negotiations with Russia mediated by America, Germany, and China.\n\nMoreover, Marga said that in Ukraine, “we are not talking about democracy”: “There is still a long way to democracy. Parties are banned there, and television is controlled by one of them. Some very wealthy people leave the country with money. The country, from which people leave with money, with everything, cannot be either democratic or developed.”\n\nIn turn, the Ukrainian embassy in Romania replied that such statements are unacceptable under any circumstances: “They are a particularly egregious violation at a time when Ukraine is heroically defending its independence and the security of all of Europe.”\n\n“We regret that the former minister of the European democratic state, Marga, is making statements that question the basic principles of international law, especially the inviolability of borders.

From stunning landscapes and popular tourist destinations and landmarks to people, traditions, and food, this series helps you discover Romania one photo at a time. This week, we put the focus on Romanian mountain lakes.\n\nThe small glacial Lake Vinderel is located on the ridge connecting Farcău Peak and Mihăilecu Peak, at an altitude of 1615m on the territory of Repedea and Poienile de Sub Munte, in the Maramureș Mountains. (Photo source - click on the number to get to the photo 172655297 © Volodymyr Martyniuk | Dreamstime.com)\n\nThe geological, faunal, and landscape reserve covers an area of 150 hectares, which is part of the Maramureș Mountains Natural Park, and aims to preserve the local biological diversity, says infopensiuni.ro. The reserve includes the Farcău and Mihăilecu peaks, Julii Cave, Bologhii Cave, Wolves’ Cave, and Vinderel Lake.\n\nThe lake is fed by snowmelt and rainwater, and by the small basins of swamp-like water located on its southern shore. The banks are grassy and slope gently down to the lake, says Bogatiile Muntilor Maramures, with some juniper thickets to the east. Other species of plants found on the edge of the lake are Edelweiss, Peat Mosses, Cottongrass, and Hawkweed.\n\nVinderel Lake has given rise to many legends, some of which describe it as a bottomless lake, others saying it is inhabited by a dragon that feeds on whoever might enter its water. One such tale, told by Stirileprotv.ro, says the dragon once ate all the guests at a wedding that was held by the lake’s side. It is also said that it is not good to throw a stone into this lake because you will start a storm.\n\nMaramureș Mountains Natural Park's website tells us of two different hiking trails that can be followed, if you want to visit Vinderel Lake:\n\nRepedea - Chicerea – Vinderel Lake\n\nTrail marking: Blue stripe\n\nTrail length: 10 km\n\nTrail duration: 4-5 hours\n\nDifficulty: medium, difficult in winter.\n\nFrom the center of Repedea the marker follows the lane leading to the school.

    "IAEA Team in Romania Concludes First Ever Site and External Events Design (SEED) Review for a Small Modular Reactor": "An International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) team of experts has concluded a safety review of Romania’s process for selecting the site of the country’s planned Small Modular Reactor (SMR), which could become the first SMR built in Europe.\n\nIn May, the Romanian Government, through state company Societatea Nationala Nuclearelectrica SA (SNN), announced that it had chosen Doicești, approximately 90 km northwest of the capital Bucharest, as the preferred site for the SMR, following an in-depth study conducted with a United States Trade and Development Agency grant. Romania requested the IAEA to conduct a Site and External Events Design (SEED) review mission to assess the process that was followed in choosing the preferred site. The SEED mission — which took place from 22 to 24 August — was the first ever IAEA SEED mission to look into site selection for an SMR.\n\nSEED missions assist IAEA Member States at different stages in the development of a nuclear power programme, including by reviewing site selection, site assessment and design of structures, systems and components, taking into consideration site specific external and internal hazards.\n\nThe three-day mission was conducted at the request of SNN. Romania currently has one operating nuclear power plant (NPP) in Cernavodă, which generates around 18% of the country’s electricity. The country is considering expanding and modernizing its nuclear power programme through the deployment of SMRs at suitable sites, in addition to other actions on the existing large plant site.\n\nSMRs have the potential to contribute to global access to reliable nuclear power. They are a fraction of the size of large reactors — about one-third of the generating capacity of traditional nuclear power reactors — and have lower upfront capital costs, shorter construction times (owing to prefabrication) and pose fewer risks to the population in case of an accident.\n\nThe IAEA’s review assessed how Romania conducted the process for the site selection of the SMR against IAEA safety standards, taking into account potential impacts to a site from external events, such as tsunamis, earthquakes and floods, and potential impacts to the population from low probability accidents at the site.\n\n“This comprehensive review will provide assurances to the Romanian public and beyond about the SMR site selection,” said Paolo Contri, Team Leader for the review and Head of the External Events Safety Section in the IAEA Department of Nuclear Safety and Security. “The recommendations made will help Romania to prepare for the construction of the SMR, by making sure that potential issues associated with site safety are carefully considered early in the process and that alternative sites are available in the event that the selected site does not meet the requirements on the basis of the detailed site characterization. It is important that potential external hazards are identified early to allow for adequate consideration and assessment of protective measures that may be necessary for the defence in depth approach.”\n\nThe mission team comprised three experts from Germany, Türkiye and the United Kingdom. They met with senior staff from SNN at its premises in Bucharest.\n\nThe team welcomed the effort spent by SNN to conduct an objective, feasible and safety oriented site selection process in Romania. Romania documented the site selection process in a preliminary SNN report, which will be followed by a preliminary Front-End Engineering and Design (FEED) study. The SEED mission said a limited amount of additional work is needed on sensitivity analysis and collection of confirmatory data for the FEED study, together with detailed recommendations on the minimization of project risks.\n\nThe team provided some recommendations to support the optimization of the site selection process and to minimize the risk that the following phases will identify important safety issues that may affect project implementation. In particular, the IAEA team recommended that:\n\nAll data be collected in a site selection summary report, according to the recommendations issued in IAEA Safety Guide SSG-35, to provide traceable support for later decisions and site evaluation phases.\n\nA suitable graded approach be applied for the specific technology selected for the SMR to be deployed, and in accordance with the potential radiological consequences of accidents, to meet overall safety objectives. Guidelines on the IAEA approach to grading were provided.\n\nA possible additional data collection phase for the selection process — through light investigation and monitoring — be implemented for the preferred site, as back-up solutions, focused on the most discriminating selection criteria.\n\nRomania informed the IAEA that further in-depth assessments of the Doicești site are to be conducted in the upcoming period and it is actively addressing the recommendations of the IAEA SEED mission to support this work.\n\n“We invited the IAEA SEED mission because it is a priority for us to build in Romania a state-of-the-art SMR project, in full compliance with the highest safety standards, as we have done in the 25 years we have operated the Cernavodă NPP,” said Cosmin Ghita, SNN CEO. “With the continued support of the IAEA, our experience in siting and building our first SMR can be used by other countries considering building SMRs. SNN is ready to share our experience on strategic and technical aspects of SMR deployment projects.”\n\nThe final mission report will be delivered to the Government of Romania within three months.",
    "Out-of-pocket payments for health care in Romania undermine progress towards universal health coverage": "Romania has a high incidence of catastrophic health spending compared to other European Union (EU) countries, a new report by WHO/Europe finds. In 2015, 1 in 8 households incurred out-of-pocket payments that exceeded 40% of their capacity to pay for health care, the report reveals. Catastrophic health spending means a household can no longer afford to meet other basic needs, such as food, housing and electricity.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report produced by the WHO Barcelona Office for Health Systems Financing is the first comprehensive analysis of financial protection – otherwise known as affordable access to health care – in Romania. The analysis shows that catastrophic health spending is heavily concentrated among the poorest 40% of households and older people. It is mainly driven by out-of-pocket payments for outpatient medicines, followed by dental care and outpatient care.\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween 2010 and 2015, the incidence of catastrophic health spending grew, particularly among poorer households. Although access to health care improved during this period, the rates of unmet need for health care and dental care in Romania continue to be well above the EU average.\n\nGaps in coverage\n\nReforms introduced in the last few years have expanded the range of health benefits provided by Romania’s National Health Insurance House (NHIH), and levels of public spending on health have increased.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite these positive developments, the report also draws attention to persistent gaps in health coverage.\n\n12% of the population is uninsured and can only access a few publicly-financed health services. People need to pay health insurance contributions to access NHIH benefits, which some people with low incomes cannot afford.\n\nExemptions from user charges (co-payments) for prescribed medicines do not target people with low incomes, and there is no overall cap on co-payments. Balance billing and extra billing by health care providers is also problematic and undermines transparency.\n\nAccess to dental care is limited due to budget constraints.\n\nOther factors that contribute to financial hardship and unmet need include:\n\ninformal payments to health workers and for medicines and supplies, particularly in inpatient care;\n\nissues with service quality and ageing infrastructure in public hospitals; and\n\na shortage of health facilities and professionals in rural areas.\n\nMaking access to health care affordable for everyone\n\nThe new report sets out a series of policy recommendations to improve access and financial protection in Romania. These include the need to:\n\nensure the whole population is covered by the NHIH and has access to the same set of benefits;\n\nextend exemptions from co-payments to low-income households and introduce an income-based cap on all co-payments;\n\nlimit the ability of health care providers to charge people additional user charges through balance billing and extra billing;\n\ncontinue to improve the way in which the NHIH purchases medicines, including over-the-counter medicines;\n\nstrengthen the coverage and purchasing of dental care to address high levels of unmet needs in the poorest households;\n\naddress informal payments, starting with better monitoring; and\n\nsupport these changes with increased public investment in the health system; public spending on health is still low in Romania compared to most EU countries, at 4.6% of GDP in 2019 compared to an EU average of 6%.\n\nWHO supports countries in moving towards universal health coverage\n\nFinancial protection is central to universal health coverage, which is at the heart of the European Programme of Work, WHO/Europe’s strategic framework. Through the WHO Barcelona Office for Health Systems Financing, WHO/Europe monitors financial protection in over 40 countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial protection is an indicator of the Sustainable Development Goals and part of the European Pillar of Social Rights. The WHO Barcelona Office provides tailored technical assistance to countries to reduce unmet need and financial hardship by identifying and addressing gaps in coverage.",
    "Denmark's Shape Robotics wins new order in Romania": "BUCHAREST (Romania), September 23 (SeeNews) - Denmark's Shape Robotics said that it has received a 7 million Danish crowns ($918,250/941,300 euro) one-off order for its smart classroom solutions from a partner in Romania.\n\nThe order will be delivered in September partially from both local subsidiaries Shape Robotics Romania and Video Technic Systems, the company said in a press release on Thursday, without disclosing the name of its local partner.\n\n\"We see the order as strategically important, not only does it constitute a large one-off order, but also shows the potential when our companies within the group work closely together, to meet the market's needs, thus complementing each other within R&D, AV solutions and educational technology,\" Shape Robotics CEO Andre Fern said.\n\nShape Robotics' interest in the Romanian market comes as the country plans to invest approximately 2 billion euro ($1.95 billion) in digitisation of education over the next four years, using EU funds from the Recovery and Resilience Plan (RRP). Furthermore, the company is exploring opportunities in other EU countries with the same focus in their national RRP’s such as Italy, Bulgaria, Greece and Poland. The company also said it has a strong focus on new EU candidates Moldova and Ukraine.\n\nEarlier this month, Shape Robotics completed the acquisition of Romanian technology company Video Technic Systems (VTS) for 9.6 million crowns. Following the acquisition, Shape Robotics lifted its revenue expectations for this year to 81-93 million crowns from 75-85 million crowns.\n\nIn April, Shape Robotics said that it has signed an agreement with local peer KUBO Robots to distribute educational robots to schools in Romania and has signed a three-year distribution deal with Romanian IT&C retailer Altex for robots, printers, virtual reality glasses and educational software.\n\nShape Robotics already has a major agreement with several schools in Romania for the supply of the same types of products. In 2022 alone, the company will supply equipment to 100 SmartLabs in Romanian schools under a 60 million crowns deal. In November, the Danish company announced that it expects to deliver up to 1,175 SmartLabs in Romania under a project worth 420 million crowns which has been included in the EU-funded RRP.\n\nIn August 2021, Shape Robotics bought Romanian smart learning company StoryKids, its longtime partner in the country, for an undisclosed sum.\n\nShape Robotics has developed Fable, a modular robotic system that helps students to build and program their own robots.\n\n(1 Danish crown=0.1345 euro)",
    "Daddy Daughter Charity Ball raises funds for public kindergarten libraries in Romania’s rural areas": "A new edition of the Daddy Daughter Charity Ball took place in September at the Cesianu-Racovița Palace in Bucharest, raising funds for the OvidiuRo Association with the purpose of stimulating reading among kindergarten children. During the event, fifty fathers and their daughters joined forces to equip the libraries of rural kindergartens in Romania where vulnerable children study.\n\n\"Besides raising awareness and money for the social cause we chose, the purpose of our charity ball is to raise our children in the spirit of philanthropy. We want them to learn to give much more than they received and will receive throughout their lives. There are a lot of children in Romania who have nothing or very little, so the cause we chose to support this year and for the foreseeable future is the \"Read me 100 stories!\" campaign initiated by the OvidiuRo Association,\" said Mike Costache, co-founder of the Daddy Daughter Charity Ball.\n\n\"Over the past two years, 475,000 books were purchased from the top ten children's publishing houses and were put into the hands of 200,000 children learning at the 1,966 kindergartens across Romania, which completed the certification process. All this was made possible through the hard work of ten wonderful OvidiuRo employees and with the support of two million euros provided by several major donors and a few dozen smaller donors,\" he added.\n\nMany of the fathers who attended the event chose to \"adopt\" a kindergarten that will bear their family name, dedicated in the name of their daughter(s), in exchange for 13 monthly donations of EUR 100 or EUR 1,300 donated in advance. The organisers said this is how much it costs to equip a Kinder Library and to train the educators to properly read children the various 100 stories.\n\nThe breakdown of the EUR 1,300 is as follows: EUR 150 books/professor, EUR 100 books/kid's group (4 groups on average per kindergarten), EUR 50 training/professor, and EUR 100/kindergarten (logistics & monitoring implementation activity).\n\n\"On behalf of the small team of just ten colleagues, we thank you all for joining the cause we are working on. Thank you for making it possible to continue the 'Read me 100 stories!' project, through which we contribute to the early education of children, a vital element for Romania's future. We are grateful for the contributions of each of you,\" said Maria Gheorghiu, executive director of the OvidiuRo Association.\n\nNow in its third edition, the Daddy Daughter Charity Ball is part of a series of charity balls dedicated to fathers and their daughters.\n\nThe OvidiuRo Association was established in 2004 and has so far collected funds of over EUR 12.5 million, with which it has financed several social programs aimed at children from disadvantaged backgrounds, such as Each Child Deserves a Story, \"Șotron\" Summer Workshops, The Bag with two books, Stories under the magnifying glass, Read me 100 stories!, Reading Caravans, and many others.\n\nirina.marica@romania-insider.com\n\n(Photo source: the organizers)",

    "EU4Youth: first interactive map of social enterprises from Romania, Moldova and Ukraine": "September 23, 2022\n\nMore than 150 registered social enterprises from Moldova, Romania and Ukraine are now part of a free online community developed by EU4Youth, which will support business, networking and learning opportunities.\n\nThe innovative digital platform will connect social enterprises with buyers and companies driven by a strong social commitment. It was created by the EU4Youth – Social Innovation Impact – a strategic partnership project led by ADV Romania – a pioneer in the social economy sector and youth inclusion.\n\nThe vision for the platform is to enable a regional pole for the development of social entrepreneurship, spread awareness about a new way of doing business and showcase the impact of social entrepreneurs in contributing to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nWhile the three neighbouring countries are at very different stages regarding the framework for social entrepreneurship – from Romania that boasts thousands of registered social enterprises to Ukraine that has no legal framework for social enterprises – the thread connecting social entrepreneurs from Romania, Moldova and Ukraine is their ability to feel the vibe of the community and to understand its challenges, combined with their passion for crafting unique products, services, and customer experience.\n\nThe war in Ukraine tore up many of the project’s plans to boost social enterprise in the country. Of the three youth-led social enterprises that won the Accelerator of Social Enterprises competition, just one was able to take up the grant to start a social business.\n\nStill, the Map of Social Enterprises can provide a tool for supporting enterprises in Ukraine. From the project’s recent analysis, many enterprises included on the map remain active even in these times of war. Buying from these social enterprises would be the best way to support these organisations and the people behind them. Some of these social enterprises sell online and make international deliveries (for example Vereta.Store and Trava.ua). Another idea would be to pay for food from local bakeries (Goodbread) or even therapeutic, educational services for children and send them to people in need (Dunastan, Spring of Hope, Olanna).\n\nThe project hopes the map will help to create a favourable framework for networking, market access and peer learning across the three countries. The map provides an open-source virtual database containing information about the location of entities, the types of products and services supplied, the number of employees, and the impact they have on their local communities. Enterprises that want to register on the map can do so for free, by providing information about their activity and social impact.\n\nThe project is now looking for partners and funding with the aim of expanding the map to all Eastern Partnership countries and connecting it to other international databases.\n\nFind out more\n\nFull story",
    "Romania moves to put dispute over the EU-funded gamma beam facility to bed": "Romania made mistakes over the management of the contract for the construction of a gamma beam at the state-of-the-art EU research infrastructure, ELI-Nuclear Physics, and must now move things forward, the country’s recently appointed science minister, Sebastian Burduja has said.\n\nBurduja, who took up the post in May this year, told Science|Business it would be “a shame not to finish a project that has huge potential” to advance science in Romania and Europe.\n\nThe construction of the gamma beam, a secondary piece of equipment to the main high intensity laser system at the Extreme Light Infrastructure – Nuclear Physics (ELI-NP) facility, has been bogged down in complications since 2015.\n\nEuroGammaS, a consortium of European research institutions and companies, was awarded the contract to build the gamma beam, but a dispute about the specifications of the building to house it led to the contract being cancelled by Romania’s institute of Physics and Nuclear Engineering (IFIN-HH).\n\nFollowing this, EuroGammaS and IFIN-HH have been involved in court cases over the cancellation since 2018. Now government officials say it is time to put the past to bed and move on with the project.\n\n“We're really trying to be very constructive and not ask whose fault it is. We've certainly made mistakes – that's the reality of it,” said Burduja.\n\nThe shift in attitude is driven by the recognition it is in the government’s interest to complete the installation of the beam. “We see it as an essential part of Romanian infrastructure, but also an essential part of European knowledge and access to knowledge,” Burduja said. “It's a project that's never been done in the world, it has huge potential, it would be a huge shame not to finish it according to the parameters that were set in the beginning.”\n\nThe complications, though, do not end here because after the contract with EuroGammaS was cancelled, a US company Lyncean Technologies was handed a €42 million deal to take over and complete construction on the gamma beam. But in March this year the journal Science reported rumours that the company was facing bankruptcy.\n\nBurduja said the Romanian government has not received any definitive communication from the company on this matter. “We're evaluating to see their capacity to carry the project all the way to the end and essentially finalise the gamma source,” he said.\n\nAccording to Burduja, Lyncean had some financial trouble in the past couple of years, but he is not yet aware of the company declaring bankruptcy. “I think it's public information that they've had some challenges during the pandemic but to my knowledge they have made no formal notification [about the bankruptcy issue] at this point,” he said.\n\nScience|Business did not receive any response from Lyncean to emails asking about its capacity to complete the project.\n\nBurduja said that if the company is unable to complete the project they would look at alternative options, including going back to the EuroGammaS consortium.\n\nDeadlines, penalties and litigation\n\nThe ELI-NP project has already gone through two phases of EU funding, and cannot be “phased” again. It means that the facility needs to be completed by the end of 2023 to maintain its EU funding. There is a two-year buffer in which, if the project is not fully completed, the Romanian government can step in and fund it with its own resources.\n\nIf it is not completed after that buffer, which means by the end of 2025, then Romania risks a heavy penalty from the European Commission, something Burduja says it wants to avoid. The facility is being built at a total cost of €300 million, most of which is from EU structural funds, with only a small portion being covered by the Romanian government.\n\nThe project remains in limbo and cannot move forward because of the ongoing court cases over the cancellation of the first contract with EuroGammaS. This is eating into the time left to complete it, but Burduja said there is the possibility of an amicable settlement.\n\nOne possibility is that an agreement is reached about the terms of the first contract. For example, the completion of stage one of the construction of the gamma beam – there were three planned stages – could be deemed satisfactory in terms of meeting the contract requirements.\n\nThe equipment delivered to the facility as part of that first stage could also eventually be used to build a radioactive beam infrastructure that could be a tool for nuclear research.\n\nPierluigi Campana, a member of the executive board of the Italian Institute of Nuclear Physics (INFN), one of the main partners in the EuroGammaS consortium, has been following the events at ELI-NP for several years and says the situation is “very complex”.\n\nAccording to Campana, things are now better, although INFN still needs some political action from the Romanian government. “We cannot hope to build the full [gamma beam] machine by 2025 because we have wasted so much time,” he said, admitting that the terms of the EuroGammaS contract could be amended so only phase one needs to be completed.\n\nCampana said he feels the situation is moving forward positively and that recently steps have been taken by the Romanian government to resolve the issues. He spoke to Burduja at the end of July to lay out the situation and said the conclusion was that “the best path is to conclude the legal issues.”\n\nBurduja has also held talks with the Italian and French ambassadors to Romania, both of whose countries had stakes in EuroGammaS, to try to smooth out relations, as the contract dispute has had an impact on Romania’s international reputation.\n\n“The very horrible way of treating international partners was not without consequences. The whole scientific community of Romania is suffering,” Campana said. “On the other hand, our institutions have suffered because they put a lot of resources into a project that was blocked for years and this was devastating.”\n\nScience|Business also contacted another EuroGammaS partner, France’s national research centre CNRS, but it declined to comment on the situation.\n\nCampana said that despite the history, EuroGammaS would still work with Romania.\n\nAt the end of September there will be a technical meeting in Rome with representatives of Romania and the consortium to discuss how best to use the ELI-NP facility, an indication the research and science element is moving forward in spite of the politics. The general opinion of those directly or indirectly involved with ELI-NP is that science, research and the pursuit of knowledge is more important than what is going on in Bucharest courts.\n\nAnother indicator of this is ELI-NP’s growing involvement in the European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC). ELI-NP was built as part of a triumvirate of laser research facilities in central and eastern Europe.\n\nIn Hungary there is the ELI Alps institute and in Czech Republic there is ELI Beamlines. These two other facilities have come together to form the ELI European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC), which ELI-NP was left out of, due in part to the bad relations that came about after the cancellation of the EuroGammaS contract.\n\nELI-ERIC recently put out a call for users at the three laser institutions, with the deadline on September 9. The first projects are due to start in October and last until March. A second call for users will be put out in January 2023.\n\nAllen Weeks, director general of ELI ERIC, said he is very pleased that the call went out with the involvement of IFIN-HH and ELI-NP. “This demonstrates that all the facilities are working closely together, on a scientific level, to deliver the best and most advanced portfolio of laser sources in the world to the global science community,” he said.\n\nWeeks said he could not put a timeframe on ELI-NP fully joining ERIC, but is optimistic it will happen as the facility nears completion.\n\nELI-NP director Călin Ur agreed with this assessment, saying, “Even if we are not part of ERIC, we are participating in the process of defining the rules that will govern the consortium in such a way that when we join, we will be prepared to do so immediately and to be effective.” ELI-NP has received a high number of requests as part of ELI ERIC’s call for users.\n\nNicolae Marginean, director general of the IFIN-HH, stressed the need to talk about the potential of the ELI-NP facility rather than the contract disputes over the gamma beam.\n\nThe facility has huge potential, particularly the high intensity laser system which is equipped with two 10-petawatt lasers. This unique capability will allow scientists to carry out research on improving X-ray imaging, fine tuning the use of radiotherapy in cancer treatment, investigating how materials will react to radiation in space and more.\n\nTesting on the laser system is ongoing but successful trials of it at 100 terawatts and one petawatt have already been conducted. Ur said that the team of international experts brought in to run the trials described the facility as “one of the best in the world” in terms of the characteristics and quality of the beam.\n\nIf the issues with the gamma beam can be resolved and ELI-NP gets fully up and running, then there is little doubt that Romania will have a world-class facility capable of attracting the best and brightest talent from around the world. Marginean said it will be, “A cluster of excellence in nuclear science.”\n\nFor Ur, it is vital that the project is a success. “We have to demonstrate that we are capable of handling large research projects,” he said.\n\nThe Bucharest facility will help Romania stop the brain drain and attract research talent from around the world. “Most are going abroad to do research because the offer here in terms of research equipment is limited […] was limited,” he said. “Now, by having these possibilities, we can bring back people who left Romania and we can bring researchers from around the world to work here.”\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated 16 September 2022.

    "DP World links new location in Romania with Ukrainian grain lifeline": "Port of Constanta\n\nDP World in Romania is working to facilitate grain exports from Ukraine via Romania while keeping a low profile. That being said, the global logistics player will utilise a recently authorised terminal in Dornesti, near the Romania-Ukraine border, to bring more grain flows towards the port of Constanta by rail.\n\nThe new rail link that could commence anytime soon will connect Vadul-Siret in Ukraine with the company’s hub terminal in the Port of Constanta via Dornesti. The latter was developed into a functioning terminal by DP World swiftly to alleviate congestion in Constanta and serve the company’s multimodal expansion in Romania.\n\nCosmin Carstea, CEO of DP World Romania, commented on the news website The Loadstar that the new rail service could run with up to five roundtrips per week, and trains could carry up to 50 containers per time.\n\nInvestment with future\n\nUnderstandably, a global player like DP World also sees a long-term benefit in such commitments. Apart from helping Ukrainian grain to find new rail routes toward Romania, the Dornesti terminal will also boost the company’s presence in the country. Apart from its hub terminal in the port of Constanta and Dornesti, DP World is also working in another location.\n\nSpecifically, in early May, the company kicked off the construction of a new multimodal logistics terminal in Aiud, in the region of Transylvania. As the company commented, “with over 50 per cent of Romania’s industrial GDP coming from the wider Transylvania region, the Aiud terminal will perform a key role in expanding the country’s global trade while providing robust infrastructure in a region that traditionally lacked it”. Additionally, DP World stressed that the terminal will “sit directly on the train line linking Europe to China via Central Asia”.\n\nAlso read:",

    "UN General Assembly: RO president says consequences of the war in Ukraine are global, calls for further solidarity": "Video\n\nRomania’s president Klaus Iohannis addressed the general debate of the 77th Session of the UN General Assembly on September 20, talking about the “unprovoked and illegal war” started by Russia in Ukraine and its global consequences. He also called for further unity and solidarity, saying that Romania will continue to support its northern neighbour.\n\n“We are witnessing, since February 24, the dramatic consequences of the unprovoked and illegal war started by the Russian Federation, a permanent member of the Security Council, against Ukraine. We are also witnessing exceptional solidarity from numerous countries united in their support for Ukraine, a sovereign member of this Assembly and a victim of months of aggression against its civilians, basic infrastructure and economy,” Iohannis said during remarks at the UN General Assembly.\n\nHe said the consequences of the war in Ukraine, which has no justification, are global and go beyond security, referring to “blatant violations of norms and principles of international law, including international humanitarian law and fundamental human rights, and on sustainable development worldwide.”\n\n“There is no justification for bloodshed, destruction and human suffering. It is our joint responsibility to come together and uphold our common values as members of the United Nations,” he continued.\n\nIohannis also reiterated Romania’s support for Ukraine and the refugees fleeing the war. According to him, since the beginning of the conflict, over 2.3 million Ukrainians have crossed Romania’s borders.\n\n“Romania has offered not only emergency assistance, but also medium and long-term support for those who decided to stay in our country, with free access to education, health services and the labor market. In addition, we offered direct humanitarian assistance and put in place a logistic hub for coordinating international humanitarian assistance from the entire world. Our support will not stop here,” Klaus Iohannis said.\n\nHe then added: “We know that our response, especially to this war, will shape our common future. Our support for peace should be voiced now, louder than ever. In defending our universal values, it is essential to stay united and bring everyone on board, including those who are still hesitating. Engagement and dialogue are crucial to overcoming divisions and, at the same time, to counter the spread of falsehoods and propaganda.”\n\nPresident Iohannis also said that “weaponizing access to food and restricting it around the world is unacceptable,” renewing Romania’s commitment to continue facilitating grain exports from Ukraine.\n\n“In order to support the Ukrainian economy and help manage the global food crisis, Romania has acted in a responsible way by facilitating the export of more than 4 million tons of Ukrainian grain, which represents 60% of the grain exported by Ukraine, through our ports on the Danube and at the Black Sea, since the beginning of the crisis.”\n\nThe Romanian president also talked about energy security and called for “joint solutions and responsible action.”\n\n“We must avoid the use of energy as a tool of blackmail. Energy security requires strategic investments in renewables, in nuclear power - with new future-oriented projects such as small modular reactors - or in hydrogen. It also requires energy prices that are accessible for our citizens,” he told the UN General Assembly.\n\nirina.marica@romania-insider.com\n\n(Photo source: Presidency.ro)",
    "Ukrainian children in Romania. Interview with Rodica Marinoiu - Romania": "Rodica Marinoiu is the director of the SOS Children’s Village in Hemeius, Romania. A social worker by training, she joined the organization in 2008 as manager of the family strengthening programme. Today, she is managing the work of 32 staff who work in four programmes: alternative care, family strengthening, youth programme and foster care. As of 2022, Rodica is also responsible for the humanitarian action programme in Bacau for people affected by the war in Ukraine.\n\nWhy and how did you get involved in the emergency response for Ukrainian children and families?\n\nAll of us here in Bacau and in the entire Romanian association of SOS Children’s Villages immediately got involved. For me personally, all it took was the first image of people fleeing the war and going towards the unknown. It is one’s own social responsibility to engage all resources to help because that engagement means making things right. For me, getting involved in the help for Ukrainian people was natural, it wasn’t forced or asked for. People needed help and we could help.\n\nI have my own child and there are many children in our programmes who see me and my colleagues on daily basis. We want them to grow up with a strong sense of social responsibility. To inspire that, we have to walk the talk. We have to be a part of the good experience. We have to be part of the solution.\n\nWhat kind of assistance was offered to the Ukrainian people in Hemeius?\n\nA few years ago, we moved the Romanian families from the SOS Children’s Village in Hemeius to the city of Bacau. We had six empty houses in the village that we immediately opened for Ukrainian families. Some of our houses are quite big and that allowed for several families to stay together. We have moms who knew each other from Ukraine and they preferred to stay in the same house. This gives them an extra sense of security, and that’s what we want. We want them to feel safe and have time to compose themselves.\n\nHow is the local community reacting?\n\nIn May, the Mayor of Hemeius called me asking if integration activities were ever going to be on our agenda. We began with a joint event for Romanian and Ukrainian children and families. I wanted to involve both children and young people from the Romanian programmes of SOS Children’s Villages and from the local community. So, I reached out to local partner organizations who work with young people. We mixed Romanian and Ukrainian children and organized a Day of Good Deeds. They went to poor Romanian communities delivering in-kind support and creative workshops for the local children. I am proud to say that all Romanian and Ukrainian children and young people who we invited showed up despite the day being a bit rainy. They were welcomed by the local communities with bread and salt, as it is customary.\n\nOne of the activities was themed ‘childhood can colour anything’. All children were given black t-shirts and colourful powders. The winning Ukrainian Eurovision song was playing. The children splashed colours all over the dark t-shirts bringing life and happiness to the grim reality. It was a magical moment that left all adults in tears, thinking of the fragility of our lives, of all the people who lost their homes, and of the need to help each other.\n\nThe day was very emotional for everyone. This increased the trust of the local community in SOS Children’s Villages and motivated us to organize a summer school programme which aims at promoting integration and mutual acceptance.\n\nWhat is the summer school programme?\n\nThe summer school programme is a two-month long programme from 01 July to 31 August that takes place every working day from 8 am to 5 pm in the SOS Children’s Village Hemeius. Monday to Thursday the children and young people have educational, creative and sports activities, and Fridays are scouts’ days – they go together outside the village for various joint adventures.\n\nWe have two Ukrainian teachers involved along with two Romanian teachers. The young people are mainly involved in the organizational work but they also sometimes take part in the activities. There are many Romanian children involved who are not part of the programmes of SOS Children’s Villages. The aim is to bring them together, foster integration, mutual acceptance and understanding.\n\nAs I said, the motivation for the summer school was the event on 1 June. But, I have to admit that I struggled with the concept of the summer school because I am lucky enough to not know war trauma. None of my colleagues do, again luckily. We had to find a way to offer a range of activities which are supposed to make Ukrainian children feel safe, secure and comfortable, while making the topic understandable for Romanian children. So, we decided to find a common ground by basing summer school’s activities on a popular Romanian story that deals with the trauma of leaving home. The story is called Enchanted Forest and tells a story of a girl who loses her mother and has to travel in rough conditions to find safety. Incidentally, a movie based on the story is filmed in the Dendrological Park that is located just behind the SOS Children’s Village in Hemeius.\n\nI have to emphasize that my colleagues and I really put a lot of efforts in coming out with ways to approach Ukrainian children without pretending to know what they went through. To do it otherwise is simply not fair and is doomed to fail. I saw a drawing one Ukrainian child made of guns and explosives. They came from occupied territories and have witnessed shelling, shooting, killing maybe. All we wanted was to create a programme that would have them smile and laugh and play freely and safely.\n\nWe cannot solve the situation in Ukraine, but, we can give them moments of happy childhood. Maybe we cannot help them cope with their traumas right now, but we can give them the opportunity to reclaim their childhoods. At this point, that is good enough for me. And I can tell that their parents feel the same.\n\nSeeing the children engage in the programme every day, I often joke that it’s not Enchanted Forest we have here, but Jungle Book. And that’s great, because so far, the laughter we hear and the enjoyment we seen in the summer school programme exceeds our expectations which can only mean we’re doing something right.\n\nHow are the parents from Ukraine who live in the SOS Children’s Village doing?\n\nWe are individually seeking opportunities for all parents depending on their situation and wishes. Some still have jobs that they do online and we make sure to have stable, fast internet connection to enable their work. Others expressed a wish to find local jobs, so some found employment in local restaurants and factories.\n\nWe also employed two people in our village. One father who is very skilled in all construction work offered his services free of charge right away. After about a month, we hired him and he’s our colleague now. One mother also got immediately involved in housekeeping, so we hired her too.\n\nThe Ukrainian families, as much as they all want to go back home, do not want to lose any time. Their children are in online schools and we support them with an after-school programme in the local primary school with a Ukrainian and Romanian teacher to give them all the possible education opportunities. Two children are already attending the local kindergarten and two attend music lessons in the nearest music school. We must not forget that all children lost almost two years of regular schooling in the pandemic, so bringing them back to regular school curriculum, for however short the time, is essential.\n\nYou said they all want to go back home, but finding employment or enrolling to school seem like longer-term stay in Romania. How does that fit in the picture?\n\nAgain, this was a natural process. Hiring and having Mykola and Hanna as our colleagues does in no way interrupt their plans of going back home when the circumstances allow for it. But they live in the village here and now. They can help and we need them. It’s much easier to have colleagues who can speak the language of the people who live here. In addition, having them work gives them a purpose. When Mykola came, he went around fixing things with our village master without anyone asking him if he could help.\n\nWhen the war started, all the families that came first were mothers and children. Then we had several families where fathers were also in the picture. These were families where the dads were either over 60 years of age or had three or more children, as the Ukrainian regulations allow for those men to leave the country. Frankly speaking, having Mykola and other men in the village added to the feeling of safety for all Ukrainian families. Mykola experiences the village as his home. I know I don’t have to worry about who shuts the gates because he is on it all the time.\n\nAre there any problems?\n\nOf course. We work with people. It would be dishonest to say we don’t have problems. But we work through them and try hard to find solutions. That is why we employed a Ukrainian teacher who is also a psychologist to help us understand what we need to do.\n\nBeing so involved in the response to the war in Ukraine, how are you personally handling the situation? Honestly, I would have been more affected if I couldn’t do anything. If we, SOS Children’s Villages, didn’t do anything, I would have been affected and it would have been bad for me personally.\n\nRight now, we need to look at our learnings and experiences. We need to organize ourselves and our further response depending on how the situation develops.\n\nI am proud of the fact that SOS Children’s Villages Romania was there from day 1. When I see children from Romania and Ukraine hugging, I get goose bumps. I am so very proud of all my colleagues and all the work we have done.\n\nI know we are doing the right thing.\n\nInterview by Katerina Ilievska",
