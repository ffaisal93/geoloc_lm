    "2022 Discoveries Turning Namibia into an Exploration Hotspot, Says Rystad Energy": "While exploration efforts have reaped few rewards over the past few decades in Namibia, the two sister discoveries in 2022 are set to position the country at the forefront of Africa’s upstream future. Shell’s Graff-1 well – which was spud in December 2021 in Block 2913A in the Orange sub-basin – encountered light oil in January 2022. Soon thereafter, TotalEnergies’ Venus 1-X wildcat discovery in Block 2913B brought the total volume of both finds to 835 million barrels – with even more scope of increasing volumes to 1 billion barrels due to Venus’ prospectivity. In a relatively unexplored and underexplored basin, these finds have triggered newfound interest in Namibia’s upstream market.\n\nHowever, the advantages of these finds transcend the discoveries themselves, with the announcements of reserves awakening new interest by other energy majors worldwide. Rystad Energy notes that Shell has already drilled a follow-up well 8km from Graff and is in the process of evaluating its own find; TotalEnergies is expected to spud a delineation well at Venus; Chevron is reportedly set to enter Block 2813B; Eco Atlantic has expanded its presence offshore Namibia; while Galp Energies is expected to drill a probe in the new months. As such, between this year and 2025, over 15 probes are expected to be drilled offshore Namibia, thereby making the country an exploration hotspot, according to Rystad Energy.\n\nTranslating Discoveries into Tangible Developments\n\nAccording to Rystad Energy, Venus and Graff not only account for over 85% of total discovered volumes in Africa in 2022 but additionally represent the largest global finds so far this year. However, ensuring the discoveries translate into tangible project developments will take a committed approach by government and operators alike. While deepwater developments are typically capital-intensive, Namibia’s numbers are relatively competitive.\n\nConsidering the deepwater nature and development schemes of the projects, Rystad Energy notes that utilizing floating production storage and offloading units would appear the most suitable solution for the development of both Venus and Graff, with the leasing of such facilities mitigating larger greenfield expenditure and abandonment expenditure. According to Rystad Energy estimated, such schemes for both the fields will result in cumulative greenfield expenditure of a minimum $6.5 billion and operational expenditure of $20 billion – both of which are competitive for deepwater developments.\n\nMeanwhile, on the tax front, Rystad Energy notes that Namibia’s fiscal regime is relatively simple – main taxes include a 5% royalty, an additional tax ranging between zero and 50% based on the rate of return, and an income tax of 35% – and is largely in favor of operators. As such, the country’s tax terms are contractor-friendly, however, new incentives will need to be implemented to make such projects more profitable, particularly regarding the cost-intensive nature of the developments and the reduced capital expenditure associated with upstream oil and gas in 2022.\n\nThus, considering the sheer size of the two finds; the number of upstream projects that have been launched following the discoveries; and the competitiveness of Namibia’s upstream market, the country’s oil and gas future is bright and its hopes of becoming a regional producer and hub are well on the cards.",

    "Learning from Namibia": "K. P. Nayar\n\nTHERE was a time when every able-bodied, fighting-fit Namibian was a ‘cheetah’. And many of them had an Indian connection well before the real cheetahs arrived in India this month to great joy and expectations all around.\n\nAt a time when there is a debate over colonial legacies, India can take a cue from Namibia, which was never a British colony, but is a Commonwealth member.\n\nEarly in the 1980s, shortly after South Africa granted notional autonomy to Namibia — then known as South West Africa — India became the biggest supporter globally of the territory’s fight to rid itself of colonialism and racial discrimination. Such support was not only diplomatic and financial, but also had a heavy military side. Indira Gandhi gifted close to a hundred Willys Jeep to the South West Africa People’s Organisation (SWAPO), which had been fighting for Namibia’s independence since 1960. SWAPO mounted 160mm artillery guns on them and these vehicles became critical weaponry in the struggle for South West Africa’s freedom.\n\nWhen I went to Windhoek, Namibia’s capital, as part of the travelling media with PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee, I was shown black-and-white reels from those days of SWAPO fighters zipping around the mostly desert terrain along their border with South Africa and getting the better of their white oppressors. Their speed, the way they had adapted these Jeeps to local conditions and their dexterity are matched only by real cheetahs.\n\nThe African cheetah is the fastest-moving animal on earth. Such qualities in those animals became familiar to Indians last fortnight through a surfeit of television and social media coverage in anticipation of the ambitious relocation of cheetahs from Namibia to Madhya Pradesh.\n\nThe global automotive conglomerate, Mahindra and Mahindra has been importing Willys Jeeps since 1947. A variation of those World War II workhorses is now manufactured domestically and sold as Mahindra Thar. But when I saw videos of SWAPO fighters using Indian-gifted Jeeps as assault vehicles, I understood why Joseph Stalin, aligned with the US during World War II, implored US Chief of Army Staff Gen George C Marshall for 5,000 Jeeps and got them. ‘It is impossible to have too many of them, and the side having the largest number of these motors is bound to win,’ he told his interlocutors in the US military.\n\nWhen Vajpayee became PM in 1998, the first foreign capital he went to on a state visit was Windhoek. He was persuaded in this milestone by his Principal Secretary, Brajesh Mishra, who was the midwife, so to speak, in the birth of Namibia. Mishra was appointed UN Commissioner for Namibia in 1982. The same year, the UN Secretary-General appointed Mishra as head of the International Conference in Support of Struggle of Namibian People for Independence. Vajpayee had exercised India’s nuclear option and had tested two atom bombs in Pokhran by the time he reached Windhoek. Sanctions against the tests had kicked in. So, Vajpayee was easily persuaded to travel to Windhoek when he was briefed about Namibia’s potential, as the world’s second largest producer of uranium, to supply the nuclear component to India. After India signed a nuclear deal with the US and got a waiver for trade in nuclear material from the NSG, India and Namibia signed a deal in 2009. Uranium exports from Namibia are still a work in progress and need to be followed up as a strategic priority.\n\nDuring a month when the opening of New Delhi’s Central Vista and the death of Queen Elizabeth have sparked domestic debates about colonial legacies, Namibia’s case is worthy of foreign policy research. Namibia was never a British colony. The UK only had a League of Nations mandate for the territory under South African administration. Before this, it was a German colony. Yet, Namibia is a member of the Commonwealth. Sam Nujoma, the country’s first President, recognised that this membership gave his nation an extra sense of belonging in a neighbourhood made up of Commonwealth countries: Botswana, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Namibia was able to benefit from the organisation’s transnational capacity-building programmes which covered areas of Africa contiguous to its own.\n\nIndia’s first Head of Mission in Windhoek, Shiv Shankar Mukherjee, helped in Nujoma’s efforts at that time to integrate with the Commonwealth. Mukherjee recalls that at a ceremony where Namibia formally acceded to the Commonwealth, the British Ambassador — soon to be High Commissioner — said if a country wanted to join the Commonwealth, it was welcome to join the organisation’s fold. This position was formalised as the Commonwealth’s revised membership criteria in 2007. Rwanda followed Namibia’s example two years later. These are the only two members of the Commonwealth without historic ties to the UK. In June this year, its capital, Kigali, hosted the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.\n\nIndia ought to closely look at the experiences of both these African countries on how best to exploit its own links to the London-based organisation of 56 countries accounting for a combined population of 2.5 billion.\n\nDuring Vajpayee’s visit — and later when President Pranab Mukherjee was in Windhoek in 2016 — Namibians showed off their well-preserved national parks. The training that their forest rangers receive is impressive. It is worth adopting, now that India has established a wildlife relationship with Namibia through the adopted cheetahs. In the 1990s, talking points in Africa were about endangered species of wildlife. Today, Africa is a spectacular success in rolling back endangerment. In countries like Zimbabwe, these efforts have led to a big increase in elephant population. Last year, elephants killed 72 people in Zimbabwe. So far this year, 60 people have been killed and 50 injured. That tells its own story of conservation.",
    "Revealed: Namibian elephants illegally sold to Emirati zoos": "In March 2022, a group of wild Namibian elephants landed in the UAE. The New Arab's investigation reveals that the sale serves only to simulate an African safari experience in Emirati zoos with no benefit for the animals and Namibian locals.\n\nSpanning over an area of eight square kilometres, the recently opened Sharjah Safari Park in the United Arab Emirates claims to be the world’s largest safari outside Africa. With space for 50,000 animals of 120 species from across the continent, it promises to “simulate the real regions of Africa” in the Arabian desert.\n\nThe park’s elephant enclosure, entitled the ‘Niger Valley’, is large by zoo standards, with an opulent waterfall and pool, but barren of any kind of vegetation one would expect to find in a savannah. There are no fences to be seen, but artificial rock formations demarcate the park boundaries.\n\nThe Niger Valley is home to 13 wild African elephants, who huddle together under the shade of large umbrellas, their only respite from the glaring sun and up to 50 degree Celsius heat typical of UAE summers.\n\nThese elephants are part of a larger group of wild elephants that were exported from Namibia to the UAE in March of this year. Initially captured from their natural habitat in the northwestern Kamanjab constituency of Namibia in early September 2021, they spent six months in quarantine captivity.\n\nMap of the 'Niger Valley', where the elephants are located at Sharjah Safari Park. [TNA]\n\nThe elephants were then heavily sedated before being loaded into shipping containers, onto a plane, and transferred to their final destinations: the Sharjah Safari Park and Abu Dhabi’s Al-Ain Zoo. The first of the two state-owned facilities is an initiative of the Environment and Protected Areas Authority (EPAA) established in 2017 by the ruler of Sharjah, Sheikh Sultan bin Mohammed Al Qasimi. As for the Al-Ain Zoo, it was founded in 1968 by the late Sheikh Zayed, the founder of the UAE.\n\nBoth facilities are said to be part of the UAE’s larger wildlife conservation efforts, and the arrival of the Namibian wild elephants is supposedly part of this project. In reality, the sale served primarily commercial purposes under a cover of conservation, and violated international guidelines that discourage the removal of wildlife from their natural habitat.\n\nAt the time of publication, there are a confirmed 13 elephants in the Sharjah Safari Park and eight to nine elephants are thought to be in the Al-Ain Zoo. While the elephants in Sharjah were on display for the public, those in Al-Ain have not been seen by The New Arab (TNA), and remain enclosed in a large hangar, likely only to be exhibited in the beginning of 2023. In late August, when The New Arab visited the Al-Ain Zoo for the second time in a few months, an Emirati tourist guide put the number of elephants at nine. He had never seen them though, and was convinced that they had come from Zambia.\n\nWildlife trafficking is considered to be the fourth most lucrative illicit trade in the world, worth an estimated USD 15 billion annually. Technically, this is not supposed to be a wildlife trafficking story, but that of an African government selling tuskers to Emirati zoos. The export echoes a wildlife trafficking story though, when looking at the involvement of shadowy intermediaries, the violation of international conventions on endangered species, the mistreatment of the elephants, and the lack of long-term benefits for conservation or the communities affected by their presence.\n\nElephants under the shade at Sharjah Safari Park, 30 May 2022. [TNA]\n\nNamibia: A for-profit conservation model\n\nNamibia is often presented as a country with exceptional wildlife conservation management policies to be replicated across the African continent, but has recently relaxed rules relating to the hunting and sale of wild animals.\n\nNow, the southern African nation is one of the leading proponents of the ‘sustainable utilisation of wildlife’. The government’s conservation model supports commercial trade of wild animals and products derived from them. Namibia, along with other countries in southern Africa, has been a long-time proponent of legalising the ivory trade.\n\n“Wildlife must have a commercial value in order for it to be protected. They are firm believers in commercialising wildlife,” said Adam Cruise, an investigative environmental journalist who has conducted extensive research on Namibia’s elephants.\n\nOn 3 December 2020, the Namibian government announced an auction to sell 170 'problem' elephants, with offers needed by 29 January 2021. It was organised on short notice, announced only in a government publication, and took place over the main holiday period. In the tender, the Ministry stated the requirements that entire family groups must be captured together using qualified professionals, following all international guidelines.\n\n\"The old saying that guides the official approach to the country’s conservation agenda is: 'If it pays, it stays'\"\n\nOn 15 February 2022, the ministry officially announced that 57 of the 170 elephants had been sold to successful bidders, 37 of which had already been paid for and captured, including the 22 that were destined for the UAE. The remaining 20 auctioned elephants were still roaming free, pending payment in full and the issuance of related export permits. They were expecting to generate N$5.9 million (USD 326,000) from the sale in total.\n\nIntermediaries pocketed most of the profits though. According to media reports, South African game farmer Gerrie Odendaal - whose name was confirmed to be among the successful bidders by the Namibian government - paid 3.3 million Namibian dollars (USD 183,000) for the capture of 22 gentle giants, and went on to sell an indeterminate higher number of elephants (with two of them being born while in quarantine) for N$17.17 million (USD 950,000) to another South African dealer, Elske Burger. She then proceeded to handle the export to the Emirati zoos. Elske Burger declined to comment by the time of publication.\n\nThe whole deal was reportedly worth around N$50 million (USD 2.76 million). Speaking to The New Arab on condition of anonymity, another South African wildlife dealer described the amount as “feasible” for that number of elephants.\n\nBurger was also involved in the sale of Zimbabwean elephants to the Dubai Safari Park in 2018, according to data released by the Zimbabwean government.\n\nThe tender posted by the Namibian Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism in a local newspaper announcing the auction of 170 wild elephants.\n\nToo many unruly elephants or a water problem?\n\nAccording to official government figures as of 2019, Namibia has an elephant population of 24,000. However, conservationists and wildlife experts believe that the real number is considerably lower.\n\nIn response to questions submitted in December 2018 by Namibian journalist John Grobler, one of the authors of this investigation, the Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism’s (MEFT) Deputy Director for Natural Resource Management Colgar Sikopo stated that Namibia’s elephant population has grown from the 1995 count of 7,000 to 16,000 by 2004, and then 24,000 in 2019.\n\nHe said that the population “is growing at about 3.3% per year”. But these numbers don’t work out. A 3.3% compound growth for 24 years, starting from the 1995 total, would have produced an elephant population of around 15,000.\n\nIn reality, the numbers that Sikopo quoted represent an implausibly high annual population growth of 5.3%, close to the widely held theoretical maximum for African elephants of 7%. Elephants in Namibia have experienced ever increasing human encroachment into their habitat and a once in a generation drought – not the ideal conditions of heavy rainfall and peace from human disturbance.\n\nIn fact, in the study that the 7% number comes from, rain is cited as one of the biggest indicators of high population growth. The validity of the reported Namibian population numbers are further brought into question when you consider that for the 1995 to 2004 period they show a per annum growth of 9.6%.\n\n\"According to official government figures as of 2019, Namibia has an elephant population of 24,000. However, conservationists and wildlife experts believe that the real number is considerably lower\"\n\nCompare these numbers to what has been seen in Kenya, where officials boast about having had great success cracking down on poaching and increasing their elephant stock. It saw a 21% jump in seven years, from the peak of poaching in 2014 to a population of 36,280 in 2021. This represents a 2.76% year on year growth, just half of Namibia’s claimed growth.\n\nIn addition, Namibia is well known for its small and unique population of what are considered ‘desert-adapted’ elephants roaming the ephemeral river systems in the Kunene region of Namibia, in which Kamanjab is located.\n\nExplaining the reasoning that informed the decision to remove the elephants from the Kamanjab region, Chief Public Relations Officer for the MEFT Romeo Muyunda explained to The New Arab: “We calculate in terms of the carrying capacity of the area against the current population that is there. The reason why the specific areas, Kamanjab included, were selected is because there is too many elephants there.”\n\nSatellite images show impact of drought and human encroachment between 2011 and 2020. Rainfalls brought some respite in 2022.\n\nHowever, in recent years studies have shown that the ‘desert-adapted’ elephant population of this region has been in sharp decline due to severe droughts as well as hunting and conservation mismanagement.\n\nIt is believed that the elephants sold to the Emirates come from this population, though there is argument over whether or not they are from the “true desert population”. Given the small numbers of surviving desert-adapted elephants, the export could threaten the group’s existence.\n\nThe Namibian government asserts that the motivation behind the sale of their wild elephants is because of the increase in dangerous interactions between humans and elephant populations across the country, what is referred to as human-elephant conflict (HEC).\n\nSpecifically, they claim that in the four areas that the elephants were taken from, droughts have driven elephants into farmland areas in search of water, damaging infrastructure and crops and posing a threat to local farmers.\n\n“With an estimated 180 freehold farms affected by elephants, infrastructure damages could come to N$9 million (USD 498,000) using a conservative estimate of N$ 50,000 per farmer per year,” wrote Gail Thomson, a consultant with Namibia’s Chamber of Environment.\n\nLast June, Gerardo Martinez, head of elephants at Sharjah Safari Park, told Dubai This Week TV programme that the elephants were causing “a lot of conflicts in the villages where they lived” and that the Emirati safari park stepped in to “save” them.\n\nFurther comparison with Kenya posed questions on the validity of HEC as the motivating factor behind the sale. Kenya has more elephants and much more people in a smaller area, and while they do experience difficulties with wildlife management, they have not resorted to removing elephants from the country. Namibia, on the other hand, is one of the least densely populated countries in the world. Kenya also does not allow for trophy hunting, whereas Namibia does.\n\n[Table compiled by drawing on a combination of government and UN data].\n\nConservationists and wildlife experts have also challenged the Namibian government’s claims of increased HEC, and believe that it is being used as the cover story for a financially-motivated sale.\n\n“The reality is that HEC is a complete fabrication that the Namibian government uses to justify these translocations,” said Cruise. He explained that the term itself can be misleading: ‘conflict’ implies there’s danger or threat to human life, when in reality interactions with elephants are rarely ever aggressive or dangerous, and the damage is almost always confined to crops or property.\n\nThe claimed HEC ‘hotspots’ are in fact commercial farming areas that have expanded in recent years, crossing into elephant corridors.\n\nIn cases like these, regulations and conservation protocols of the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), the only major international treaty on wildlife trade to which Namibia and the UAE are both signatories, say that the elephant groups causing trouble should be relocated within the country or at least the southern African region, and that wild areas or private reserves should be their final destination in order to keep the elephants as close to their home habitat as possible, known as in-situ conservation.\n\n\"Given the small numbers of surviving desert-adapted elephants, the export could threaten the group’s existence\"\n\nRelocations within the region would have been sufficient to address HEC, and the other 15 elephants that have already been captured were relocated within Namibia. In the case of the UAE-bound elephants, Thomson said that local relocations would have been the ministry’s first choice.\n\n“Although it wasn't a requirement, they had a strong preference to keep them in the country, if there had been a lot of tenders,” she said, but the requirement to take whole elephant herds drastically reduced the number of buyers able to comply with the terms.\n\nHowever, The New Arab was told that several offers had been made to the ministry to relocate the elephants within Namibia. Rob Roy Ramey and Laura Macalister Brown, US researchers heading the Namibian Desert Elephant Conservation project, have studied this population for decades. When the ministry launched the auction, they submitted a proposal to relocate the Kamanjab ‘problem’ population to enhance the gene pool of the Hoarusib population further in the west. But they never heard back from the ministry.\n\nThe New Arab also spoke with an NGO that had contacted the Namibian authorities at the time of the announcement of the auction, and offered to assist with logistics and securing funding to translocate the elephants to areas of Namibia where populations had declined. A draft of the proposal was also shown to The New Arab. These offers were also not taken up.\n\nWhen asked about NGOs offering to relocate the elephants, the ministry’s PR officer Muyunda explained that the offers had come in too late: “When there’s a public tender out we expect people to give offers regarding the public tender … Any other alternative solution that anybody is giving outside the tender will not be considered.” He then asked: “Why do they wait until government takes a decision to auction?...Issues of Human Wildlife Conflict are continuing at the moment as we speak.”\n\nWild elephants in Namibia's Kamanjab region seen near a local farm. [John Grobler for TNA]\n\nIn late July The New Arab visited the communal farming areas of Kamanjab to speak to farmers and other members of the community about their experiences with HEC and whether or not they wanted the elephants to be removed.\n\nOver the 32 interviews conducted, there were points that came up time and time again: the farmers do have a water problem, but HEC is just one factor rather than the main cause; they aren’t getting enough help from the government; people are only injured by elephants when they behave aggressively towards them to start with; they don’t want the elephants to go away, for sentimental reasons but also because their presence attracts tourists.\n\nThe last ten years of drought were extremely tough for people in the region, including Aaron Ikurua, a farmer from Driehoek Opstal whose cattle all perished. He is now instead forced to only keep goats, which drink less water but bring in less money.\n\nDroughts have taken a heavy toll on northwestern Namibia over the past decade. [John Grobler for TNA]\n\nThe elephants have also been struggling throughout the drought years and are drawn to pools of fresh water, such as the large open top concrete cisterns – known locally as dams – that farmers pump water into. Often elephants will come and drink from the dams and leave without causing any damage, though this is still a problem as it forces farmers like Ikurua to use up more of their already scarce diesel: “So the little diesel you are buying for the goat [to pump water] the elephant is coming and drink the dam out.”\n\nThings are then made worse when the elephants have calves with them that are unable to reach over the wall and drink from the dam: “The older ones just puts their trunks in and drinks, but once they are with younger ones and can’t reach then they will pull out the pipe,” said Michael Nowoteb from Farm Driehoek Pos Een.\n\nNowoteb’s farm has a government waterpoint that had been damaged by elephants the night before The New Arab’s visit. Just like every other time this happened, he had to repair it himself and reportedly received no financial aid from the government: “We haven’t received any assistance from anyone. Imagine damage like that for 20 years.”\n\nLidia Brummer is co-owner of Huab Valley Lodge, where she runs wildlife spotting trips for tourists. Elephants are their main attraction.\n\n“If we have water points for them, where they can drink and refresh, I doubt if we are really going to have conflicts,” she said.\n\n\"'We are not against the elephants here, as long as we got support from somebody, the conservation or the government or somebody. But we are on our own.'\"\n\nDespite the problems that elephants cause, all of the farmers interviewed by The New Arab – bar one exception – did not want to see them removed. Instead they wanted the government to do more on the ground to help them.\n\n“We are not against the elephants here, as long as we got support from somebody, the conservation or the government or somebody. But we are on our own,” said Aaron Ikurua.\n\nFarm Ruspoort, run by the ǁUirab family, was the only place where The New Arab encountered a fully anti-elephant sentiment. Salonika ǁUiras said that elephants had broken their water tank a few years ago, and that they’ve repeatedly raided her vegetable garden. ǁUiras has a complaint not shared by other farmers: she claims that their cattle herders refuse to stay out at night because they are scared of elephants, which means that they then lose livestock to predators.\n\nThe cattle herders’ fear of elephants at night is understandable; even Michael Nowoteb, who has lived with elephants his whole life, admitted that he finds it “really scary” when the large noisy creatures come near his home after dark.\n\nHowever, incidents in which locals are badly injured or killed are extremely rare and seem to be the result of people acting aggressively and trying to chase elephants away. “If you learn nice with them, you stay together, no problems,” said Adam Bahono, a guide at the local Himba Village.\n\nElephants drink water from cisterns in Namibia. Human-Elephant Conflict is mostly due to lack of government support for water management. [John Grobler for TNA]\n\nA portion of the money made from Namibia’s wildlife goes into the Game Products Trust Fund (GPTF), so that it can then be spent on helping people in game areas live with wildlife. According to a MEFT statement released on 15 February this year, N$4.4mn (USD 243,400) from these elephant sales has already been paid into the GPTF.\n\nHowever, many of the farmers that The New Arab heard from say that they currently don’t receive any help from the government and have never heard of the GPTF. In the end, just 10% of the total USD 2.76 million reportedly paid for the elephants would have gone back to the Namibian government.\n\nAn alternative way for the people in the region to profit from the elephants is through tourism. Lidia Brummer, from the Huab Valley Lodge, said that it would be a “very sad day” if the elephants were to disappear from the region, and would greatly impact tourism.\n\nShe also highlighted that elephants had stopped crossing into the lodge, with only one sighting of elephant tracks in three months. Brummer referred to human encroachment as the reason why elephants have become more nocturnal. Capture operations are likely to further discourage their appearance in the daylight.\n\nAaron Ikurua also spoke about how important it is that the elephants stay so that people from Europe continue to visit, adding that, “We like them, they are a beautiful animal, we are blessed to have elephants here in Namibia.”\n\nEmirati zoos adamant on importing wild-caught elephants\n\nThe Sharjah Safari Park officially opened its doors in February 2022. However, plans and preparations to import wild African elephants go back at least a decade, long before the Namibian government announced its intention to auction.\n\nIn May 2021, The New Arab spoke to a prominent UK-based zoo operator, who said that many years ago, he had had a conversation with an Emirati colleague in Sharjah in which he was told that a very large hangar was being built to house elephants. The most obvious location for this would have been the Sharjah Safari Park.\n\nSharjah’s EPAA began the expansion of a conservation park into the current safari in June 2016. Taking into account the planning stage and the fact that Sharjah only has African species in its collection, they likely had to plan the sourcing of the pachyderms three or four years before starting construction of the elephant compound.\n\nAsked whether the UAE would have considered the impact of this import on the Namibian ecosystem, the former CEO of an Emirati safari park told The New Arab that “the UAE authorities would have turned a blind eye to the status of the elephant population in Namibia, passing the responsibility to the zoos themselves to do any background check.”\n\nAs for Al-Ain, the zoo had expressed interest in acquiring elephants as early as 2010. Official plans for African elephants date back to July 2019 though, when construction began on the zoo’s AED 93 million (USD 25 million) elephant safari project, which promises a feeding experience that is “unique to the GCC area”.\n\nThe beginning of construction of elephant housing facilities in both Sharjah and Al-Ain long before the Namibian government announced its plans to sell the elephants suggest that the UAE’s demand for African elephants was already high.\n\nThe New Arab sought a right to reply from all of Mona al-Shamsi, the head of CITES at the Emirati ministry of environment and water; Hessa al-Shamsi, the director of EPAA communications department in Sharjah; Hana Saif al-Suwaidi, the EPAA chairman; the Sharjah Government Media Bureau; Ghanim Mubarak al-Hajeri, the Director General of Al Ain Zoo; Jane Budd, the head of veterinary services at EPAA; Mariam Bint Mohammad al-Mheiri, the minister of climate change and environment; and Daniel O’Loughlin, the head of education at Sharjah Safari.\n\nSatellite image apparently shows hangar at the edge of Sharjah Safari Park elephant exhibit. The elephants are supposedly kept here during the night, as well as periods of extreme heat in the warmer months.\n\nAs The New Arab is banned in the UAE, it sought their comment through independent journalists working on this investigation. Nevertheless, none of the concerned parties was available to comment by the time of publication.\n\nThe owner of Maguari-One Zoo, the company contracted to design the Sharjah Safari Park, is Dutch national Koen Brouwer, who is also the former head of the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA). Koen Brouwer’s design included the ‘Niger Valley’ elephant enclosure in the park. He was not available to comment by the time of publication.\n\nAl Ain Zoo is accredited by EAZA, while the Sharjah Safari Park was reportedly hoping to become a member.\n\nPaul Vercammen, another Dutch zookeeper, was involved in the decision-making process, according to multiple sources. He is operations manager at the EPAA-managed Breeding Centre for Endangered Arabian Wildlife (BCEAW). Vercammen is also an EAZA council member. He was not available to comment on his alleged role by the time of publication.\n\nEAZA Director of Communications David Williams-Mitchell told The New Arab that the association “is made up of institutions, not individuals, and we have no mandate to investigate the actions of people who work for our Members unless their actions are clearly taken on behalf of that Member”.\n\nWhile planning the acquisition of African elephants, the Emirati safar parks ignored the warnings of established zoo associations like EAZA and sidelined them in the decision making process.\n\n\"For Emirati rulers, the tourism-driven African theme of their wildlife parks apparently mattered more than the success of breeding programmes. And for this, the Emirati zoos were willing to pay a high price\"\n\nArne Lawrenz, the EAZA ex-situ Programme (EEP) coordinator for elephants, told The New Arab that, around 2019, he had been approached by Mark Craig, the former Al-Ain Zoo Life Science Director, and that he had made “absolutely clear that there are no imports [from Africa] with a breeding programme”. Lawrenz explained that EAZA had imported African elephants in the past but the breeding programmes had not been successful. Mark Craig was not available to comment by the time of publication.\n\nUnlike the African pachyderms, Asian elephants had been doing really well in EAZA facilities, according to the EEP coordinator, to the extent that they had to stop breeding to avoid overpopulation. Lawrenz informally proposed to Craig and Vercammen the transfer of Asian elephants to the Emirati zoos but was told that they wanted to have Africans only.\n\nFor Emirati rulers, the tourism-driven African theme of their wildlife parks apparently mattered more than the success of breeding programmes. And for this, the Emirati zoos were willing to pay a high price. Lawrenz described the “philosophy” of the Emirati zoos as “I got the money, I want to have it. I don't care if that works.” The outcome was a lucrative deal finalised through middlemen rather than a non-commercial exchange between zoos.\n\nIt was also clear from the beginning that the Emirati zoos were interested in obtaining large families of tuskers as soon as possible and were unlikely to source them from a breeding programme.\n\n“They asked for huge families. And we don’t have huge families at the moment within the breeding programme. So we said we have some older females, we might have some bachelor groups available. But that takes time, [...] you have to [...] get on a waiting list... But they just wanted to have elephants and they had built everything in advance,” said Lawrenz. He complained about the Al-Ain Zoo having been elusive in the run-up to the import and said he had learned about it as a fait accompli.\n\nEAZA did not agree to share with The New Arab copies of the two internal complaints filed by Dr. Lawrenz with regards to the Al-Ain Zoo. After months of back and forth with EAZA officials, during which The New Arab kept sharing information and questioning the role of the European association’s members in this sale, EAZA decided to terminate the Al-Ain Zoo’s membership on the 15th of September.\n\nWhile Sharjah Safari Park was not yet accredited by EAZA, the Al Ain Zoo recently had its accreditation revoked as a result of the controversial export.\n\nIts statement said the import of the Namibian elephants implied “multiple breaches” of EAZA rules. It further cited lack of transparency and the decision to go ahead with the import in spite of EAZA’s opposition as reasons for ending the membership of the Emirati zoo.\n\nMembership will be officially terminated by the end of this year but the Al-Ain facility has the right to appeal. Further measures against EAZA members might be announced in the association’s annual meeting scheduled to be held on September 30.\n\nIn violation of international treaties\n\nIn August of 2019, 184 CITES members voted on a resolution to end the export of live African elephants. Namibia voted against the resolution, but it passed anyway with a two-thirds majority. One year later, to the surprise of many, Namibia’s MEFT announced its plans to capture and auction 170 wild elephants.\n\nThis was not particularly out of character for Namibia: it had previously sold wild elephants to Mexico and Cuba. Zimbabwe leads the region’s pro-trade agenda with exports of more than 140 elephants to captivity in China over a seven-year period. However, these trades were made before the 2019 decision that these transactions were not and could not be in the animals’ best interest.\n\nAll species covered by CITES are listed in three appendices corresponding to the level of protection needed, with Appendix I being the most endangered. Due to the bigger size and stability of the population, Namibian elephants are listed under Appendix II meaning that they are, “not necessarily threatened with extinction, but in which trade must be controlled in order to avoid utilisation incompatible with their survival.” Despite the threat of extinction faced by Namibia’s desert-adapted elephants, no official distinction is made.\n\nAppendix II allows for the trade of wildlife, but the amendment passed in 2019 explicitly bars the export of elephants from Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and South Africa to any country where the elephants are not naturally occurring, except in the case where there is an explicit conservation benefit.\n\n\"While all parties involved claim that the trade was legal and done with the wellbeing of the elephants in mind, international guidelines were clearly flouted, and involved parties were likely aware of this\"\n\nElephant populations are not present in the UAE, and under these terms, it would be extremely difficult to justify that the export of wild elephants to captivity in zoos would provide a conservation benefit.\n\nTo get around these regulations, the parties involved exploited a loophole, upgrading the elephants from Appendix II to Appendix I, a move that is permissible given that Appendix I should afford the elephants more protections.\n\nAppendix I prohibits the trade of listed species for commercial purposes. However, in a highly controversial issue within the convention’s policies, zoos and safari parks are considered ‘primarily’ non-commercial sites, and the transaction is therefore not prohibited. This is considered one of the biggest loopholes in CITES, which has a troubled reputation among conservationists, and has drawn widespread criticism.\n\nAt the Sharjah Safari Park, Gold tickets, which include a luxury vehicle and private guided tour, go for AED 275 (USD 75). The Al Ain Zoo offers an even more lucrative experience; a Safari SUV experience costs AED 1,050 (USD 286). In the four months after its opening, Sharjah Safari Park had already attracted 35,000 visitors.\n\nIn addition, under CITES regulations, before any trade can be issued, both the exporting and importing countries must produce a non-detriment finding, a conclusion by the country’s Scientific Authority that the proposed trade will not negatively impact the survival of the species.\n\nIn the case of the 22 wild elephants, no non-detriment findings have been made public from either Namibia or the UAE, as these would have certainly triggered scientific challenges of the conclusions reached.\n\nSeveral animal welfare and conservation groups have independently sought legal opinions regarding whether the wild elephant sale was illegal under CITES provisions, which are binding for member states.\n\nAn elephant skull in Kamanjab, Namibia. Droughts and human encroachment have reduced elephant population numbers. [John Grobler]\n\nThe New Arab obtained a copy of an opinion submitted by Cullinan & Associates, an environmental law firm, on behalf of EMS Foundation, a South African animal welfare group. Lawyers came to the conclusion that, given that the elephants likely came from the desert-adapted population, both Namibia and the UAE, “could not reasonably be satisfied that the proposed export of such a large number of animals would not be detrimental to the survival of the species.”\n\nThe legal opinion therefore concluded: “We do not believe that it would be lawful for the Namibia CITES Management Authority to issue an export permit under either Appendix I or Appendix II of CITES. Similarly, we do not believe it would be lawful for a country outside of the range of states for Loxodonta Africana [i.e. African elephants] to issue an import permit.”\n\nAnother legal opinion submitted to CITES for consideration in March concludes that, “any previous or future export of live wild-caught elephants from Namibia to a destination outside the natural range of the species … does not comply with the provisions of CITES.”\n\nIn response to this investigation, CITES spokesperson David Whitbourn asserted that, “the [CITES] Standing Committee considered the issue and did not feel that there was sufficient evidence of non-compliance…for it to take action.”\n\nThe 19th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (CoP) to CITES is scheduled to take place in Panama City in November, and regulations governing wild elephant trade are on the agenda.\n\nWhile all parties involved claim that the trade was legal and done with the wellbeing of the elephants in mind, international guidelines were clearly flouted, and involved parties were likely aware of this.\n\n“If this whole transaction was ostensibly legal as Namibia and the UAE claim, then why was the whole thing very clandestine? It was done under this cloud of secrecy… clearly something was done that they knew wasn’t quite right,” said Cruise, the environmental investigative journalist.\n\n\"'If this whole transaction was ostensibly legal as Namibia and the UAE claim, then why was the whole thing very clandestine?'\"\n\nSplit up families and succumbed calves?\n\nIn the Namibian ministry’s original tender, it specified that successful bidders would have to capture an “entire herd as per lot size and not leave infants/juveniles behind”. Government officials and pro-trade conservationists place great emphasis on this requirement as an indicator of the importance of animal welfare during the process.\n\n“That requirement was an ethical one. The ministry didn’t want small elephants being taken and shipped to zoos, they wanted whole herds being taken at once,” said Thomson, the consultant with the Namibian government.\n\nThomson said that the likelihood of a member of a family unit being left behind was “very very small” since elephants of a herd tend to bunch together when threatened.\n\nCruise, however, contested this and explained that even though elephants group together, “there's always a very good chance that they forgot a few of them…that they left a few behind.”\n\nAt least one member of the herd was reportedly left behind. The owner of a farm, next to where the group was captured, told The New Arab that a large bull was left there alone because it could not fit in the transport container. There have been no reports on the condition or well being of this abandoned bull.\n\nWildlife dealer Gerrie Odendaal is likely to have taken this route when transferring the elephants from Namibia’s northwestern Kamanjab to his farm in eastern Gobabis in early September 2021.\n\nGerrie Odendaal, in an article written by Gail Thomson, spoke about a young elephant among the group that “seems to be an orphan,” as it “does not associate closely with any of the adult females.” He assumes that this must mean that its mother had been “killed some time” before the capture. However, he gives no reason why he came to this conclusion, as opposed to having missed the mother in the capture operation, separating it from its calf. This would have contravened the rules of the tender.\n\nRudie Van Vuuren, a conservationist who relocated the other 15 auctioned elephants within Namibia, explained to The New Arab that when he had captured his elephants, his team had done lots of scouting work to determine family groups.\n\nOnce they had captured the elephants, they took blood from each to do DNA testing and determine family relations. Van Vuuren said that the blood work was given to the MEFT. However, when speaking with The New Arab, the MEFT’s Muyunda could not recall the existence of any DNA records.\n\nWhat is known is that the UAE-bound group of 22 elephants were captured in Kamanjab and taken in trucks on an eight hour overnight trip to Odendaal’s quarantine facility. From there, the number of elephants being transported becomes difficult to confirm.\n\nThe New Arab has heard from multiple industry sources that there are rumours about what happened to the calves born at Odendaal’s facility: Several sources believe that they died after being subjected to powerful sedatives during transportation, or that they were separated from their mothers during the transfer and then rejected upon reuniting.\n\nCaptured elephants were kept in quarantine for six months at Gerrie Odendaal’s Farm Mooiplaas in eastern Namibia. [John Grobler for TNA]\n\nIf they were born in captivity, Cruise believes it would have been extremely irresponsible to transport them at such a young age, and that the chances of them dying would be “almost certain”.\n\nMuyunda, when asked about these calves, could only confirm that “none were left behind.”\n\nIf calves or heavily pregnant cows were flown, this would most likely be in contravention to the CITES transportation rules: the advice for carriers guidelines states that “pregnant animals, or animals that are still dependent on their mother” are not fit to fly.\n\nAs is often the case though, CITES regulations provide for “exceptions”, including for females of species that are “pregnant for most of their lives and it is, therefore, not practicable to avoid shipping them when they are in this condition”. This might be exploited as a loophole, given that African elephants’ gestation period lasts for 22 months and they usually procreate every four years.\n\nCITES guidelines for non-air transport, which would apply to the elephants captured by Odendaal and transferred to his paddock, are more stringent though. “A pregnant female for whom 90% or more of the expected gestation period has already passed” is not considered fit for transport.\n\nCITES is also clearly opposed to sedation, whose “side-effects are still not fully known and, furthermore, animals that are in a lethargic state are very vulnerable to injury if violent movement of the aircraft, ship, lorry or train is experienced”.\n\nExceptions are allowed, but “a qualified veterinarian should normally accompany the animal.” Neither the Namibian nor the Emirati authorities provided any evidence as to whether a veterinarian had accompanied the elephants.\n\nIn an interview with Gail Thomson, Odendaal said that he was in “constant contact” with vets while the elephants were “in his care.” However there is no mention of precisely when his care ended. The New Arab attempted to contact both Odendaal and the vet who had been reportedly present during the capture, to verify if a vet had accompanied the animals while they were flown to the UAE, but received no response.\n\nCITES spokesperson David Whitbourn did not respond to queries on the potential violation of the aforementioned transport guidelines and deferred discussions on the elephant trade to the CoP meeting scheduled in November.\n\n\"'To enclose an elephant in anything beyond its natural range is total cruelty'\"\n\nInternational action needed\n\nWhen The New Arab visited the Al Ain Zoo in late August, the facility was empty with very few visitors. Under the scorching heat the zoo had come to resemble a desert, covered in sandy hills. There are wells that are filled with water every morning, but by late afternoon they appear to have dried up.\n\nDriving around in the air conditioned SUV, stopping to feed carrots to ostriches and giraffes, the animals - antelopes, zebras, rhinos, and lions - appeared to be panting, congregating and hiding from the heat under the shade. Once they are on display, these are the conditions the Namibian wild elephants will encounter.\n\n“To enclose an elephant in anything beyond its natural range is total cruelty, especially if it has grown up in the wild,” said Cruise.\n\nOne of the most concerning elements of this deal is that it points to a growing demand in the UAE for wild animals, taking them from their natural habitat and putting them in captivity, not for conservation as they claim, but for personal and public pleasure and status, as well as a willingness to meet this demand from certain nations home to African elephants. The Sharjah Safari Park alone can host up to 50,000 African animals.\n\nThis deal likely is one of several before it, and unless the inadequacy of international regulations and oversight mechanisms is addressed, it's likely there are many more to come.\n\nEAZA’s decision to end the membership of the Al-Ain Zoo was a step in the right direction, but the road ahead is still fraught with loopholes and complicit institutions. International spotlights are now on CITES to adopt more stringent measures in their summit in November.\n\nMatteo Mazzoleni contributed to this investigation.",

    "Namibia genocide: Opposition demands new deal with Germany": "\"For a long time, we thought the Greens were our friends,\" said Nandiuasora Mazeingo, chairperson of the Ovaherero Genocide Foundation (OGF), shrugging his shoulders at news from Germany that the Berlin government sees no need to renegotiate the Joint Declaration with Namibia.\n\nThe deal was thought to have brought an end to years of negotiations to recognize the genocide of Herero and Nama people during the German colonial period in what is now Namibia.\n\nHowever, the agreement led to heated debates in the Namibian parliament in September 2021.\n\n\"It seems like this issue in Germany is only about gaining political power,\" Mazeingo said in an interview with DW. \"But we will outlast these governments because we are on the right side of history!\"\n\nStill, the leader of the official opposition in Namibia, McHenry Venaani, has hope in the environmentalist Green Party, part of the Germany's governing coalition with the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) and the neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP) .\n\nStreet Debate: The price of the genocide in Namibia\n\nThe president of the country's largest opposition party, Popular Democratic Movement (PDM), has written an open letter to German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, a member of the Greens, which DW has obtained. In it, he called for the agreement to be \"renegotiated\" and \"restructured.\"\n\n\"Frau Baerbock had shown credibility while she was a candidate,\" Venaani told DW. \"Now we have to see if she brings the same understanding as a minister.\"\n\nBotswana and South Africa should join negotiations\n\nVenaani is particularly concerned about the diaspora communities.\n\n\"There are descendants of genocide victims living in Botswana and South Africa — and they are left to fend for themselves,\" he said.\n\nHe wants their representatives to be included in the renegotiation process, but told DW that the German government could perhaps begin talks with the government of Botswana.\n\nMcHenry Venaani has called for the agreement to be 'renegotiated' and 'restructured'\n\nVenaani's statements have been met with mixed feelings in Namibia. OGF chairperson Mazeingo rejected the politician's call for more government participation.\n\nWhile agreeing with the demand to include the Herero and Nama in the diaspora, he criticized a possible participation of more governments as a \"perpetuation of the exclusion.\"\n\nHe refered to the fact that the Ovaherero Traditional Authority (OTA) and the Nama Traditional Leaders Association (NTLA) — which see themselves as the official representatives of the diaspora communities — were not part of the negotiations between Germany and Namibia.\n\nHowever, Ileni Henguva, a traditional councillor for the Ovambanderu, said that the affected communities had actually been considered in the original negotiations with the German government, therefore he sees no need for further talks.\n\nThe German Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not want to comment on the demands when contacted by DW. As a matter of principal, Berlin does not respond to open letters, a spokesperson told DW.\n\n\"We respect the difficult decision making process and the discussions within the Namibian society and politics,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nDemonstrators call attention to the genocide in Windhoek, Namibia in May 2021\n\n'We will shame them'\n\nThe ministry also referred to discussions about the implementation of the joint declaration that took place in March 2022 between Namibian and German delegations in Windhoek.\n\nUltimately, renegotiating how the terms of the deal would be implemented seemed like a possibility, though this might not appease the critics in Namibia, where the OTA is demanding a completely fresh start to talks.\n\n\"We are not going to sign a sham agreement that makes Germany look good on the international stage,\" OTA representative Mazeingo emphasized to DW.\n\nHerero people were driven off their lands by German settlers, and when captured were sent to concentration camps\n\nWording in dispute\n\nHe demanded an admission of guilt by the German government. In the eyes of the OTA, the biggest stumbling block lies within the wording of the Joint Declaration, which calls the atrocities committed between 1904-1908 a genocide \"from today's perspective.\"\n\nOpposition leader McHenry Venaani also wants a clear, legal recognition of the genocide. In his open letter to Baerbock, he wrote that the atrocities \"cannot only be recognised in a moral and political sense.\"\n\nIn his interview with DW, he referenced reparations again, describing the aid deal — worth €1.1 billion ($1.34 billion) to be paid out over 30 years under the Joint Declaration — as an insult.\n\n\"It's not about extracting the largest possible sum. We are only asking for a package that will sustainably improve the socio-economic conditions of the affected communities,\" Venaani said.\n\nThe PDM party leader argued that even the Namibian government has come to understand that the people of Namibia are not ready to accept this agreement.\n\nThis also applies to a possible apology by the German government. A \"half-baked apology\" would only lead to boos in the Namibian parliament, he said. OGF chairperson Mazeingo shared these sentiments.\n\n\"We are going to organize protests. We would make sure that whoever comes here to offer an apology is shamed, shamed to know that it is the biggest mistake that they have done to come to the people whom they have brutalized and to come here and pretend to offer an apology that is not genuine, \" he told DW.\n\nModern-day slavery Illegal workforce Despite the fact that slavery is prohibited worldwide, modern forms of the sinister practice persist. More than 40 million people still toil in debt bondage in Asia, forced labor in the Gulf states, or as child workers in agriculture in Africa or Latin America.\n\nModern-day slavery Sold, threatened, exploited Human trafficking is big business, according to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. Sectors such as construction or mining exploit almost exclusively men, while victims of forced prostitution and exploitation in private households tend to be women. But something they all have in common: they are coerced into working through threats, the use of violence, or fraud. Most cases go unreported.\n\nModern-day slavery When children are enslaved Because of poverty parents may sell their children as labor. That's often the case in Lake Volta, Ghana, where children are forced to work for fishermen. Parents are told their children will get to do an apprenticeship. But in reality, they're kept as slaves in appalling conditions. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO) there are around 10 million child slaves worldwide.\n\nModern-day slavery Child brides One in five girls is wed before she turns 18, according to the UN Children's Fund UNICEF. Not all of these marriages are forced arrangements. But every year millions of underage girls are forced into marriage before the age of 15. In many cases they're taken out of school and essentially live as unpaid laborers in their spouse's home. Many report physical and sexual abuse in the marriage.\n\nModern-day slavery Locked up All over the world, girls are exploited as house slaves — by their own family or by strangers. Poverty-stricken families may be promised that their children will get the chance to go to school. But once they're taken, these girls are locked inside the house and forced to work 12-14 hours a day. Many also suffer sexual abuse. The number of unreported cases is high — even in industrialized nations.\n\nModern-day slavery Millions held in debt bondage Under this form of slavery, victims are forced to work to pay off a debt. Often the debts continue to pile up, even if the whole family toils for 10 hours a day at the brickworks, or in their owner's quarries, fields or mines. Often the debts are also inherited by children. The ILO estimates there are around 30 million people working as debt slaves, most of them in India and Pakistan.\n\nModern-day slavery Nowhere to turn Illegal migrants are especially vulnerable to exploitation, regardless of where in the world they are. They often have nowhere to claim rights, usually cannot speak the local language, and don't know where they can turn for help. It's not clear how many illegal migrants work in agriculture in Europe alone. But many live in abysmal conditions as they slave away for well below the minimum wage.\n\nModern-day slavery Born into slavery The descendants of African slaves in Mauritania are called \"Haratin.\" Although slavery is officially banned in the northwestern African country, people are still inherited or sold as property there. An estimated 600,000 women, men and children in Mauritania are currently exploited as domestic workers or in the agriculture sector. That's one-fifth of the population.

    "AFRO 2- Malaria project changes lives - Namibia": "RUNDU - About ten kilometres on the eastern outskirts of Rundu is the Mayana village, an area characterized by flood plains. In fact, Mayana means flood plains in the local dialect and is named after the low-lying ground surrounded by water.\n\n“We have a lot of water bodies down here and mosquitoes breed everywhere,” explains Johannes Lipayi, the AFRO 2 Malaria project coordinator for Mayana and Sikondo villages, situated in the Kavango East and West regions.\n\nThe village is in one of five districts among the five regions selected to participate in malaria cases reduction study because of the high number of malaria cases and deaths in those areas. The other districts are in Omusati, Oshikoto, Ohangwena, and Kavango West. The study was part of the World Health Organization's (WHO) continuous efforts to support Namibia in its fight against malaria.\n\nThis three-year pilot project was implemented in 2018 with the aim to reduce malaria transmission through larviciding while also using environmentally friendly chemicals.\n\n“We were trying to see if the water bodies where mosquitoes are breeding if treated with a biological agent would contribute to reducing the mosquitoes transmitting malaria,” explains Dr Florence Soroses, the Malaria National Project Coordinator with the WHO.\n\n“Before the implementation of the project in this village we had a lot of malaria cases and deaths. But as soon as the program started the cases started to decrease,” explained Lipayi.\n\nThe community has always been open to the initiative. When word of the project spread, the community gathered in large numbers at the house of the headman to enquire how they could be involved, explained Lipayi.\n\n“When we compare this village to others where this project has not been implemented you can tell the difference,”said Lipayi.\n\nIn 2020, 13,633 malaria cases were recorded in Namibia. Out of this number, 40 people died from malaria. In 2021, 13,740 malaria cases were recorded in the country. The number of deaths decreased to 15.\n\n“Even when we were reporting the data, we could see a decrease in malaria cases compared to previous years before the project was implemented,” said Lipayi. Meanwhile, Markus Kamburu is a 42-year-old father of five children. For the past three years, Kamburu was employed as a Field Operator on the malaria project in Mayana village. His work schedule started as early as 6 in the morning, and sometimes, he would need to work night shifts depending on the labour.\n\nKamburu’s duties included larval habitat mapping, larviciding as well as setting up the CDC light traps for adult mosquito collection. In addition, Kamburu and two other teammates also had the responsibility of conducting larval surveys, a process which includes the monitoring of mosquito larvae activity and density in the breeding sites. They started by counting the number of households in the village and found the village has 3,365 houses. Out of these 20 houses were randomly selected to be part of the study. The team identified 65 breeding sites. These breeding sites hold water during the rainy season which can be anywhere between December and May. Some breeding sites have water throughout the year.\n\n“These are the breeding sites that we always monitor to see if there are some larvae. If there are larvae, we larvicide. At the very beginning, however, we started with the mapping process and then we did the larviciding for the breeding site which we identified if there were some larvae there,” explained Kamburu.\n\nKamburu says he had no prior knowledge of identifying larvae and neither did he have any technical knowledge of malaria. He was appointed by the village headman in 2018 when the project started.\n\n“The chemicals we use for larviciding were very impressive because when we use them, we expect to find larvae in two to three days when we get back. We will find the larvae floating already. We were also collecting adult mosquitoes. Even while the mosquitoes are adults, we still collect some. So, this process was really fighting the mosquitoes at all the stages of their lives and therefore reducing malaria,” explained Kamburu.\n\nIn addition to larviciding, Kamburu says the team also uses the prokopack aspirators, which operates as a vacuum to collect outdoor resting adult mosquitoes. This process is usually conducted in the early morning hours. For indoor resting mosquitoes, they use the CDC light trap to catch the adult mosquitoes overnight.\n\n“These are the methods we use to collect the mosquitoes in the village,” he explained. After collecting the data, the team records and sends samples for further analysis to their supervisor, Dr Soroses in Windhoek. “We have an organised system that we use to record and send the data to Dr Soroses,” explained Lipayi.\n\nThe WHO injected N$1 million towards the project. In May, the funding for the project officially came to an end, with the community and the WHO hailing it as a success. The Country Representative, Dr Charles Sagoe-Moses said the difference the project has made in the community shows that “the biological agent used works in malaria control”.\n\nJoseph Mbamba says the knowledge and experience he has gained from the project are invaluable. “I go out in the community to raise awareness on malaria. I also take the equipment to demonstrate how we do our work,” he added. The project also helped him financially because he was able to pay for his son’s higher education.\n\n“The WHO invested a lot in these people. My hope is that the Ministry of Health and Social Services or the private sector will take over the project so that their knowledge will not be wasted,” said Lipayi. He also fears that malaria cases will increase again.\n\n“These people know the methods that are used in malaria control, and they are very well informed about that. They attended annual workshops and training and now it’s up to the government to look at their plight and take over,” said Lipayi. Echoing similar sentiments, the headman of Mayana village, Berthold Shinimbo called for investments in the malaria project. “This will enable the community to take over. As you can see, we have a high unemployment rate,” said Shinimbo. The AFRO 2 project was implemented with the goal to strengthen national capabilities for the implementation and scaling up of evidence-based, innovative, diversified and environmentally friendly malaria vector control interventions with a particular focus on winter larviciding as an additional vector control tool to achieve malaria elimination by 2022. The project was also implemented in Botswana and Eswatini.\n\nFor Additional Information or to Request Interviews, Please contact:\n\nMrs Celia Kaunatjike Tel: +264 (0) 61 255 121 Email: kaunatjikec@who.int\n\nDr. Sirak Hailu Medical Officer: Maternal Health\n\nTel: +264-61-255 121/191\n\nFax: +264-61-204 6202\n\nE-mail: sirakk@who.int",
    "Namibia Discovers Oil While Pursuing Green Energy": "The first \"green hydrogen\" power plant being built in Africa is expected to begin producing electricity in Namibia in 2024, an official from France-based HDF Energy told Reuters news agency this week.\n\nThat presents something of a dilemma for Namibia, which is championing the clean energy but also said this month that huge oil deposits had been discovered off its coast after many failed attempts at drilling.\n\nGreen hydrogen is produced by using renewable energy — like wind and sun, both of which Namibia has in abundance — to power the electrolysis of water. A plant producing green hydrogen, a clean power source that can potentially be used for industry and electric vehicles, is due to open in less than two years.\n\nBut at the same time, oil companies Shell and Total recently discovered the oil deposits, estimated to amount to more than 1 billion barrels, about 290 kilometers off the Namibian coast.\n\nHerbert Jauch, the head of a local nonprofit, the Economic and Social Justice Trust, wants Namibia to forsake oil drilling and focus on green hydrogen, a much-touted energy source of the future.\n\nHowever, Jauch said, it's \"tricky\" for Namibia to give up possible oil revenues when advanced nations are still making heavy use of fossil fuels, even as carbon admissions cause global warming.\n\n“The oil discovery coincides with what needs to be the end of fossil fuels, and therefore it is quite tricky for Namibia to move into that direction, to go into large-scale oil exploration,\" he said, noting the potential for ecological danger in drilling and the effects of climate change in many countries. By accenting solar energy and green hydrogen, \"Namibia could become a front-runner in renewable energy.\"\n\nMaggy Shino, the petrol commissioner at the Ministry of Mines and Energy, cautioned that there was still a long way to go before Namibia could become an oil-producing nation.\n\n“We need to understand that for us as explorers, we have a very long journey ahead of us before we can be able to change the narrative to say that we are an oil-producing nation,\" Shine said. \"We are oil finders, we have oil accumulation, but we are not yet an oil-producing nation. For us to get to that stage, a lot of work still needs to be done.”\n\nMinister of Mines and Energy Tom Alweendo said even if Namibia did begin to produce oil, it would have competition from other African countries, and citizens should not expect a financial windfall from oil revenue.\n\n“We just came from an oil and gas conference that was held in Senegal,\" he said. \"Senegal has discovered a lot of oil; so has Ghana; Uganda has oil, although they have not produced yet. So has Equatorial Guinea, so has Angola, so has Nigeria.\"",
    "Namibia on a budget": "Namibia, located on the southwest edge of southern Africa, is one of the continent's safest and most budget-friendly countries to visit.\n\nIf you want to stretch your money and get the most out of your vacation, there are cheap options so you don't sacrifice any of the magnificent sites and experiences the country has to offer.\n\nMake the most out of every adventure with help from our weekly newsletter delivered to your inbox.\n\nA trip to Africa is usually perceived as an expensive, once-in-a-lifetime adventure, but with proper planning and a willingness to rough it a bit, you can save on food, activities, accommodations, transportation and tours.\n\nHere are the top tips for creating an affordable Namibian adventure.\n\nFly to Johannesburg and take a bus to Namibia\n\nIf you’re traveling from the US, there are no direct flights to Namibia. Most itineraries have connections in Johannesburg, which has numerous flights arriving daily from around the world. The cheapest way to get to Namibia from Jo’burg is by bus and shuttle. A bus will take you to Gaborone, Botswana, where you can catch a shuttle to Windhoek, Namibia's capital. The cost is US$65 and will take about 20 hours. Along the way, you'll take in some pretty spectacular scenery while someone else does the driving.\n\nFlying into Windhoek takes only five hours, but the price is around $500. Travelers coming from Europe benefit from a nonstop route from Frankfurt.\n\nTravel during the low season\n\nDecember through April marks the wet season in Namibia. The crowds are gone, bringing down the cost of accommodations and tours. For example, a three-night stay at a game lodge in Etosha National Park will run about $1200 in July, but only $800 in January. Private and group game drives also see price reductions. Booking a group drive in the low season might even result in a private or semi-private experience.\n\nWhile it's not an ideal time of year for viewing throngs of big game, it's an excellent time for birding and seeing newborn animals. The landscape blanketed in wildflowers is also a gorgeous sight to see. Summer rains are typically isolated and brief, mainly occurring in the afternoon. Therefore, timing your excursions in the morning will allow you to relax and enjoy the welcome rain.\n\nRenting a 4WD and driving it yourself is cheaper than joining a tour © Westend61 / Getty Images\n\nSelf-drive your way around the country\n\nSelf-driving is a safe and economical alternative to a fully guided experience. A week-long scheduled group tour starts at around $1450. A 4WD vehicle outfitted for camping will cost $700 plus the cost of fuel.\n\nThe country is easy to navigate and clearly signposted. Though only about 25% of the roadways are tar, the dirt roads are well-kept and frankly more fun to drive on. Flat tires are the most common driver issue, so your vehicle will come with two spares. You'll want to make sure you know how to change one before your trip.\n\nStay at Namibia's vast network of campgrounds\n\nNamibia has no shortage of organized campsites throughout the country, which are clean and affordable with good amenities. Not only will you save a ton on lodging, but it's also an excellent opportunity to meet like-minded people and exchange stories and travel tips.\n\nThe average site costs $30 and has shared bathrooms, hot showers, as well as fire pits with grills at each spot. Some camps even have shops selling basic provisions like food, water and wood for your fire pit.\n\nNamibia has a good network of quality campsites © Cavan Images / Getty Images\n\nJoin a scheduled camping tour\n\nIt’s also possible to join a scheduled guided camping program. Companies that run these types of tours include C Africa Tours, African Overland Tours and Discovery Safari. Durations vary from three to 15 days, starting at around $450 per person. They typically include everything apart from drinks and water.\n\nThis is a great option for solo travelers and those interested in meeting others and sharing experiences. Because the logistics are taken care of and food and fuel are included, you won’t be hit with surprise costs.\n\nMix it up by staying in budget lodges and self-catering apartments\n\nBudget lodges are plentiful in Namibia. They're located all across the country and are clean, some with refreshing pools, starting at just $18 per night for a room with a shared bathroom. Self-catering apartments and homes average $60 per night for the entire place. These types of accommodations are great for spending a night or two between campsites. A nice hot shower and some air conditioning let you reset and get ready for the next leg of your adventure.\n\nStock up on groceries at the beginning of your trip\n\nNamibia's roads offer few opportunities to stop for a bite until you reach your destination, so it’s essential to shop for necessities like snacks and water before you head out. Some self-drive vehicles are equipped with a small refrigerator, allowing you to stock up and save on more than just the basics.\n\nIf you're camping or staying in an apartment, you'll have everything you need to prepare your own meal upon arrival instead of going to a restaurant in town, saving time and money.\n\nFees to enter national parks are just $7 per person per day © paula french / Shutterstock\n\nSpend your days in Namibia’s affordable national parks\n\nNamibia's national parks offer some of the world's greatest diversity: expansive sand dunes, vast deserts, plunging canyons, ancient salt pans and dramatic coastlines. Each of them is easily explored on foot or by vehicle. As of yet, Namibia doesn't offer a national park pass, but the fees are nominal. The government has added a small conservation fee to each park, bringing the total to a mere $7 per person per day.\n\nEmbark on Namibia's first shuttle service\n\nBorn out of the COVID-19 pandemic and the global shortage of rental cars, the Gondwana Collection launched a shuttle service called Go2 Traveller Transfers. It stops at nine different areas of interest: the Kalahari, Fish River Canyon, Sossusvlei, Swakopmund, Etosha and Damaraland. At each designated stop, lodges will arrange for pick-ups and returns. At $44 per leg, the service offers travelers a reliable, affordable, safe, and more environmentally friendly alternative to self-driving.\n\nThis new service could be a game changer for travel in Namibia. The drawback is that you'll need to stay in lodges and tented camps and pay for their excursions. But with the rising cost of fuel and the potential scarcity of rental cars, this option may be the more affordable one.\n\nDaily costs in Namibia",
    "Presidential terms should be \"limited\" - Namibian President": "Representative of the last wave of African leaders, Namibian President Hage Geingob, was in Luanda last week for the inauguration of João Lourenço and shared with Euronews his vision of current African politics.\n\nHe is of the view that the world has experienced three types of African leaders.\n\n“The first wave was those extraordinary personalities who told us to take up arms and fight, like Sékou Touré, Agostinho Neto, and others.\n\nThe second wave was caught up in the let's say, confusion of the Cold War.\n\nNow, as I say, the third wave of African leaders is asserting the constitutional path. We believe in limiting mandates.”\n\nHe added that there are some leaders who want to change the constitution of their country to remain in power, but believe “Generally, the people want elections, democratic elections, everywhere but nobody is perfect, just look at America.”\n\nHage Geingob is of the opinion that presidential terms be limited “because if you are elected directly by the people, you don't really have anyone to answer to but if you are elected by parliament”\n\nDuring his stay in the neighboring country, Hage Geingob did not forget who supported Namibia during the independence struggle.\n\n\"… We were really good comrades. I knew him personally. He didn't usually travel but he went to Namibia for my inauguration. We were very close. Now when it was the funeral, I couldn't travel and I thought: I have to go and pay the last tribute to him.”",
    "India reintroduces cheetahs to wild after big cats airlifted from Namibia": "Eight Namibian cheetahs have been airlifted to India, part of an ambitious project to reintroduce the big cats after they were driven to extinction there decades ago, officials and vets said.\n\nThe wild cheetahs were moved by road from a game park north of the Namibian capital of Windhoek on Friday to board a chartered Boeing 747 dubbed “Cat plane” for an 11-hour flight.\n\nThey are to be welcomed by the prime minister, Narendra Modi, on Saturday, his 72nd birthday.\n\nHe will swing open the gates of Kuno national park, a new sanctuary created for the cats, 320km (200 miles) south of New Delhi.\n\nThe 750 sq km (290 sq mile) protected park was selected as a home because of its abundant prey and grasslands.\n\nThe project is the world’s first inter-continental translocation of cheetahs, the world’s fastest land animal, according to the Indian high commissioner to Namibia, Prashant Agrawal.\n\n“This is historic, global first – game-changing,” he said. “We are all the more excited because it is happening in the 75th year of Indian independence.”\n\nCritics have warned that the Namibian cheetahs may struggle to adapt to the Indian habitat and may clash with the significant number of leopards already present. But organisers are unfazed.\n\nOne of the cheetahs in a transport cage at the Cheetah Conservation Fund in Otjiwarongo, Namibia, before being airlifted to India. Photograph: Dirk Heinrich/AP\n\n“Cheetahs are very adaptable and [I’m] assuming that they will adapt well into this environment,” said Dr Laurie Marker, founder of the Namibia-based charity Cheetah Conservation Fund, which has been central to the project logistics. “So I don’t have a lot of worries.”\n\nThe project has been in the making for more than a decade. Initial discussion started in the 1990s, she told AFP.\n\nIndia was once home to the Asiatic cheetah but it was declared extinct there by 1952. The critically endangered subspecies, which once roamed across the Middle East, Central Asia and India, are now only found – in very small numbers – in Iran.\n\nNew Delhi has since 2020 been working to reintroduce the animals after the supreme court announced that African cheetahs, a different subspecies, could be settled in a “carefully chosen location” on an experimental basis.\n\nThe five females and three males, aged between two and five-and-a-half, will each be fitted with a satellite collar.\n\nThey are a donation from the government of Namibia, one of a tiny handful of countries in Africa where the creature survives in the wild.\n\nVets draw blood from one of the Namibian cheetahs in preparation for the relocation. Photograph: Cheetah Conservation Fund/Reuters\n\nNegotiations are ongoing for similar translocation from South Africa, a government official said on Friday, with vets suggesting 12 cats could be moved.\n\nCheetahs became extinct in India primarily because of habitat loss and hunting for their distinctive spotted coats.\n\nAn Indian prince, the Maharaja Ramanuj Pratap Singh Deo, is widely believed to have killed the last three recorded cheetahs in India in the late 1940s.\n\nOne of the oldest of the big cat species, with ancestors dating back about 8.5m years, cheetahs once roamed widely throughout Asia and Africa in great numbers, the Cheetah Conservation Fund said.\n\nBut today only about 7,000 remained, primarily in the African savannas.\n\nThe cheetah is listed globally as “vulnerable” on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature’s red list of threatened species. In North Africa and Asia it is “critically endangered”.\n\nTheir survival is threatened primarily by dwindling natural habitat and loss of prey due to human hunting, the development of land for other purposes and climate change.",
    "Namibia, Botswana have agreed to stop border killings – Kapofi": "DEFENCE minister Frans Kapofi said Namibia and Botswana have agreed to abolish instances of citizens of the two countries being killed by their defence forces.\n\nHe said the agreement was made when officials from the two countries held a meeting at Swakopmund last year.\n\nKapofi was speaking during a meeting with traditional leaders at Eenhana recently.\n\nHe said he informed traditional leaders in the Zambezi region about this.\n\n“We have heard of our people killed by the Botswana Defence Force while crossing into Botswana. We were discussing those aspects and I assured them that we are engaging our counterparts in Botswana. That aspect of people being killed should not be repeated,” Kapofi said.\n\nHe said the government has put policies in place for Namibians found within the borders or territory of Botswana, or Botswana nationals found poaching in Namibia.\n\nThose transgressing the law will be arrested, charged and taken to court, he said.\n\nKapofi said earlier this month, the Namibian chief of defence, air marshal Martin Pinehas engaged his counterpart in Botswana on issues relating to bilateral relations and cooperation between the two countries.\n\n“We decided when we met them at Swakopmund last year that we must put up structures that safeguard the safety of our people along our borders, and that the killing of our people, be it in Namibia or Botswana must stop forthwith,” he said.\n\nOver the past two decades, about 35 Namibians have been killed in Botswana anti-poaching operations, such as the three brothers Tommy Nchindo, Wamunyima Nchindo and Martin Nchindo and their Zambian cousin Sinvula Munyeme.\n\nThe four were killed in November 2020, along the Chobe River in the Zambezi region.\n\nAt the time, Botswana claimed they were part of a syndicate of poachers believed to be part of a network responsible for cross-border poaching. However, the Nchindo family denied those claims.\n\nNamibian Lives Matter representative Charles Siyauya yesterday told The Namibian despite Kapofi's pronouncement, there would likely be little action from the Namibian government.\n\n“It's an old song. There is no protection from the government of Namibia. God is the only protector of the lives of Namibians in the Zambezi region.\n\n“It is one of those unchecked political statements by honourable Kapofi, who is too arrogant, and lacks sympathy with the people he was supposed to protect from external threats posed by the government of Botswana, which is thirsty and is craving Namibian blood,” he said.\n\nILLEGAL FENCING IN ANGOLA\n\nKapofi also asked traditional leaders to inform residents grazing in Angola to stop fencing off grazing areas.\n\nHe said some Namibians have put up homesteads and declared themselves headmen in Angola, without the permission of the Angolan authorities.\n\n“Now people are angry,” Kapofi said.\n\nHe said all Namibian citizens grazing in Angola should be known, and they should not violate Angolan laws.\n\n“Angola is a friendly country but if we push them, they will just close the borders and if they close the borders, what do we do? Please, let's try and respect the sovereignty of that country,” Kapofi said.",
    "Namibia launches special week to educate learners on climate change effects": "WINDHOEK, Sept. 26 (Xinhua) -- Namibia on Monday launched the National Readathon Week to educate learners about the ongoing climate change challenges that the country and the world are facing.\n\nSpeaking at the launch, Ministry of Education Arts and Culture Deputy Executive Director Gerard Vries said a theme has been carefully picked to enlighten learners about the impacts climate change poses on the key economic sectors such as agriculture, fisheries, tourism, health, energy, and livelihoods in Namibia, and how they can be mitigated.\n\n\"In reaction to the impact of climate change, we persuade all learners, teachers, parents, and every other person to read information, particularly about the ways to reduce climate change,\" he said.\n\nNamibia is one of the largest and driest countries in sub-Saharan Africa, characterized by high climatic variability through persistent droughts, unpredictable and variable rainfall patterns, variability in temperatures, and water scarcity, he said, adding that even though the country does not contribute significant amounts of greenhouse gasses to global emissions, climate change impact is being experienced already with long periods of drought that have lasted for years while flooding has increased in some areas.\n\nReadathon is a week of reading arrangement held every last week of September, where children and young people in schools are pledged to read various quantities and different types of reading materials accompanied by games, dramas, and plays.\n\nThis year, the week is running under the theme titled \"Read Namibia: Understand the impacts of climate change on key economic sectors and livelihoods in Namibia.\"\n\nThe curriculum in readathon is based on developing children's ability to successfully decode and build fluency, while enjoying being read to regularly, at home, and at school, to fully appreciate the magic of books and expand their knowledge which ultimately impacts their reading comprehension.\n\nThe readathon, which is observed nationwide in Namibia, will run from Sept. 26-30.",
    "Things to know before going to Namibia": "Namibia is a vast and mostly unpopulated country, full of otherworldly desert landscapes and wildlife that has adapted to some of the harshest conditions on the planet. Because Namibia is safe and largely free of malaria, it’s a great destination for families and adventurers.\n\nOn my most recent visit to Namibia, my husband and I spent two weeks exploring by car and plane from Windhoek to Sossusvlei, and then from Swakopmund we drove down to Walvis Bay, meeting locals eager to share information about their country along the way.\n\nSqueeze every moment out of your next vacation with tips and tricks from Lonely Planet in our weekly newsletter delivered to your inbox.\n\nSome of the worst travel stories I heard while there involved theft from open taxi windows and credit card fraud. I know now that hailing a random taxi in the streets of Windhoek is not always a great idea, and while you might think that taxi drivers know the way to your destination, that may not always be the case. We once gave the address of a not-so-touristy local shop and were dropped off in the wrong place, only realizing the error after we paid and got out of the taxi.\n\nI also learned about credit card cloning, where thieves make a digital copy of your credit card info using a disguised electronic scanner or some other device. Keep your eyes on your card at all times, ask vendors to bring the card reader to you instead of them taking your card and doing the transaction out of sight.\n\nHere are the nine most important things to know when planning a trip to Namibia.\n\nOff-road driving skills are useful on unpaved roads in Namibia © Cavan Images / Getty Images\n\nA self-driving tour of Namibia is a doable adventure\n\nTraveling by car in Namibia is safe though time consuming if you want to explore large portions of the country. Paved roads, like the Trans-Caprivi and Trans-Kalahari highways, are well maintained and link the most-visited corners of the country. If you’ve got the time, a self-drive safari is an affordable way to experience Namibia.\n\nManeuvering on unpaved roads comes with its own set of risks. On gravel roads, flying pebbles while passing other cars can cause damage to windshields, and driving on uneven terrain requires a sturdy 4WD vehicle as well as off-road driving skills. Driving with headlights on is a must at all times of the day. Avoid driving at night because of roaming animals.\n\nIn remote corners of the country, gas stations are few and far between, so keep an eye on the gas tank and fuel up every chance you get. Always travel with snacks and plenty of water.\n\nTo avoid credit card fraud or cloning, rent your car online through a major rental company, such as Avis, Budget, Triple Three Car Hire or Imperial, which operate across Namibia and at the international airport.\n\nNamibia doesn’t require a tourist visa\n\nYou don’t need a visa to enter Namibia if you’re a tourist and staying for fewer than 90 days. Check your passport to make sure it is valid for at least six months beyond the intended stay in the country and that it has sufficient blank pages for entry and exit stamps.\n\nMalaria is a risk depending on where in the country you visit © Anastasiia Shavshyna / Getty Images\n\nCheck your vaccines\n\nThere’s no risk of yellow fever in Namibia, but if traveling there from a country with risk of yellow fever transmission or transiting for more than 12 hours through an airport of a country with risk of yellow fever transmission, travelers are required to have a yellow fever vaccination certificate.\n\nOther recommended vaccines for traveling to Namibia include hepatitis A, hepatitis B, tetanus, typhoid, and rabies. Confirm that your routine vaccines and boosters, such as MMR, chickenpox, diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, shingles and polio are up to date.\n\nBring malaria medication to Namibia’s north in the wet season\n\nMalaria is a risk when visiting the north and northeast regions of Namibia during the wet season (November to June). You might need to start taking malaria medication several days before your trip, depending on the medicine your doctor prescribes. Check with your doctor about suitable anti-malarial tablets before visiting Namibia. There’s low to no risk of contracting malaria in the rest of the country, including the iconic Skeleton Coast.\n\nView wildlife from a safe distance\n\nWildlife is, well, wild and unpredictable. If you’re on a safari tour, your guide will give you instructions and protocols to follow. If you opt for a self-drive safari, follow the park’s rules, most of which advise you to drive a safe distance from wildlife and to remain in your car unless you are in a designated area and it is safe to get out and walk.\n\nDon’t drive between elephants in a herd, particularly if you see females with their young. If an animal seems disturbed or agitated, slowly back off.\n\nStay vigilant of your belongings when visiting Namibia’s cities\n\nNamibia is a stable country, but to stay safe during your visit, you should be aware of your surroundings. Keep an eye on your possessions, particularly when exploring Windhoek and other town centers where pickpockets can target foreign tourists. Beware of scams, such as someone trying to divert your attention while an accomplice snatches your bag or phone.\n\nIt’s best not to bring expensive jewelry or watches to Namibia. Whenever possible, leave valuables in the hotel safe. Keep cameras, phones and large amounts of cash out of sight when moving around in public. Avoid changing large amounts of money in busy public areas, and if you’re paying by credit card, try to keep your card in full view to avoid the risk of cloning. To do so, insist that the card reader is placed in front of you.\n\nIf you’re renting a car, keep car doors locked and windows shut while waiting in traffic. Keep valuables out of sight during the day and never leave anything in the car when parking overnight.\n\nTaxis are cheap, but know what you’re getting into\n\nIf you don’t have a rental car, taxis are a cheap and convenient way to get around in cities like Windhoek, Swakopmund and Walvis Bay. To operate legally, taxis must have a government registration. But that doesn’t stop anyone with a car from driving a “pirate taxi” in search of a fare. Sometimes these pirate taxis pick up more passengers during your ride. Ask your accommodations or tour operator to call a taxi for you or to recommend a reputable taxi company.\n\nBefore getting in the taxi, know your destination or ask the driver if they know how to get there, and always negotiate the fare in advance. Taxis don’t take credit cards, so make sure you have exact change because often drivers can’t break big bills and will require you to stop somewhere to get change. While riding in the cab, never place your bag or other belongings on the seat next to an open window; at a stop light someone in the street could reach in and snatch it.\n\nEven in winter, temperatures are still high in Namibia © Anastasiia Shavshyna / Getty Images\n\nBe prepared for the heat, but don’t forget there’s a rainy season too\n\nNamibia boasts on average 300 days of sunshine per year, with high temperatures no matter the season. Expect summer temperatures to reach 40°C (104°F), while winter temperatures hover around 25°C (77°F).\n\nThe coastal area, where the Namib Desert is located, is the driest region, as is the Kalahari Desert in the south. The air is humid and can get quite foggy along the coast, particularly in the early hours of the day. The northeast is the rainiest area of the country, with an average of 50 to 60cm (20 to 23.5 inches) of rainfall per year. The peak of the rainy season is from January to March.\n\nDress in earth tones\n\nKeep your wardrobe for Namibia simple and practical. If you’re going on safari, muted earth colors such as beige, khaki and olive green are best because they blend into the environment. During a safari, particularly a walking one, avoid wearing bright or colorful clothing and perfume. Long sleeves protect you not only from the sun but also from mosquitoes and other insects. Shorts, T-shirts, comfortable pants and long skirts are a good bet for when you’re in town.\n\nPack a light jacket or sweater for early morning and evening outings, and a lightweight waterproof jacket in case of rain. Comfortable walking shoes are a must, as are hats and sunglasses. Don’t forget sunscreen, swimwear, lip balm and moisturizer.",
    "NC plasters band aid on broken leg": "THE reported new-found togetherness in domestic football is an illusion, and the Fifa normalisation committee's decision to overturn the ban of five officials of the expelled Namibia Premier League (NPL) is erroneous, says former Namibia Football Association (NFA) first vice president Isaak Fredericks.\n\nThe warring factions remain steadfast and have not reconciled, and plans are afoot by “unhappy members” to challenge the position of the normalisation committee (NC), he says.\n\nFredericks was tasked with overseeing the expulsion process of the NPL and its officials by the NFA executive committee, which has since been dissolved and replaced with the Fifa remedial body.\n\nOn Thursday, NC chief Bisey Uirab announced that disputes within the Namibian football fraternity have been resolved after reversing the banishments of NPL chairman Patrick Kauta, his deputy Bonifatius Paulino, Peter Nakurua, Gabriel Tjombe and Harald Fuelle from all NFA activities.\n\nAs a result of this 'unity', a sponsor had been tied down for the top tier national men's league and women's youth league, with kick-off set at early November, ending months of dormancy.\n\nThe conditions “imposed by and attached to our sponsor” are that all football fraternity disputes are resolved, and “all clubs and members work closely together to protect the image of football and that of the sponsor”.\n\n“Therefore the reversal of the bans was done “in the spirit of reconciling various factions and normalising the game,” Uirab said in a statement.\n\nFollowing “in-depth consultation”, the NC found “it is evident that there was no legal basis for the 'expulsion' of these executives, who were at the time not members of the NFA or members of a member as contemplated by Article 15”.\n\nThe decision to expel the NPL officials for bringing the association into disrepute was based on “errors of interpretation or misunderstandings”.\n\nHowever, Fredericks contests that the NPL and its executives were correctly and simultaneously dismissed at the NFA's 16th extraordinary congress on 23 July 2020 in accordance with Article 15 of the NFA constitution, which empowers congress to expel a member, or a member of a member.\n\nThe NC flouted procedure “to sell a dream” of unity, Fredericks charged.\n\nHe said the NPL has accepted the expulsions and has established a rival national football body with plans to run “a professional league” that has no ties to the NFA.\n\n“They were members of a member. They acted on behalf of the NPL. You cannot separate the two. We correctly followed due process,” Fredericks says.\n\nHe says the new NC has shown little regard for the NFA structures that overwhelmingly approved the NPL's dismissal from the national football mother body's register and impeached former NFA president Ranga Haikali before also prematurely ending his tenure via the ballot last year.\n\nBoth steps, which Fifa endorsed, were effected at congress, the highest decision-making organ of the NFA.\n\nThe NC says it has consulted extensively and are in unison with Fifa over reversing the expulsions.\n\n“The whole process from the side of the NC is unprocedural. A congress decision can only be reversed by the very same legal platform. They say it has no legal basis, but all the facts are there,” Fredericks charged.\n\nHe further accuses the NC of being under the influence of a mystery third party.\n\n“Since their inception, they [NC] operate under strong third party influence and concentrate or go full out for non [NFA] members. We are not going to use names but we know who they are,” Fredericks says.\n\n“There is no reconciliation in football. That is not true at all. You can't reconcile by trying to fool people or undermine them.”\n\nHaikali declined to be drawn into the argument of whether they had made an error. Instead, he called on all parties to rally behind the NC and to find common ground.\n\nNPL remnant African Stars Sports Club, chaired by Kauta, welcomed the development. The NPL has yet to respond to a query on the subject.\n\n“African Stars is elated to learn of the correct decision of the NC to unban football and invalidate the so called expulsion of the executive members of the Namibia Premier League. We are also encouraged by the steps taken by the NC to start football in a sustainable manner,” African Stars said in a statement on Friday.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Stars and the other clubs which did not renounce their NPL status in the aftermath of the expulsion would seek NFA membership in order to benefit from the sponsorship.\n\nThe NFA-run Namibia Premier Football League is the only Fifa-recognised top tier division in the country.\n\n“We hope this decision by the NFA NC will go a long way in restoring the dignity of the game and bring the alignment of purpose to build the football industry. Football is bigger than all of us, and in the end it will triumph,” Stars stated.",

The system will allow SMEs to have a website hosting and online marketplace that caters to their products and services.\n\nThe new project will also cater to automated governance and registration guidance as the pilot project found an overwhelming need for accounting and tax support.\n\nSince kicking off in 2019, the project has delivered exciting designs that will diversify Oranjemund’s economy.\n\nHits: 17",
    "Namibia to learn from Equatorial Guinea on LNG development": "Namibia and Equatorial Guinea are looking to strengthen energy ties and specifically focusing on LNG development and knowledge-sharing opportunities.\n\nA high-level delegation led by Hon. Tom Alweendo, Namibia’s Minister of Mines and Energy, is conducting a diplomatic visit to regional gas leader, Equatorial Guinea, this week with the aim of strengthening energy ties and expanding dialogue between the two nations.\n\nThe delegation conducted a site visit to Equatorial Guinea’s Punta Europa Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) complex (EG LNG), gaining insights into facility operations.\n\nBilateral meetings discussed the role NOCs play in driving oil and gas developments in Africa; the training and development of nationals; and the role gas plays in boosting the local and regional economies, with both SONAGAS and GEPetrol providing key insight into strategies for gas monetisation as well as the rapid developments of resources.\n\nHaving made two sizeable oil and gas discoveries this year, Namibia is committed to seeing these developments come online as soon as possible.\n\nIn May 2007, EG LNG’s first cargo was delivered, making it one of the fastest LNG projects in terms of the timeline it took from final investment decision to first cargo - and Namibia’s Minister Alweendo is hoping to replicate the project’s development.\n\nA group of Namibian engineers will stay on in Equatorial Guinea for the next four months, training and working closely with Equatorial Guinean nationals.\n\nMinister Alweendo said, “This way, it will accelerate the process for us to build the skills. It is a new industry for us so we need to start building those skills and this agreement will really help us and we are thankful for that. As Africa, we need to start increasing collaboration among ourselves.”\n\nHe said Namibia has very recently had two discoveries in February and it is time to engage and collaborate with Equatorial Guinea so that it can embark on the next phase in the industry’s development, learn lessons it can tap into and see what Equatorial Guinea has done already, especially in terms of local content, human development and industry on the ground.\n\nFollowing the visit to Equatorial Guinea, Minister Alweendo is set to depart for Senegal, where he will join other West African energy ministers at the 2022 edition of the MSGBC Oil, Gas & Power conference – taking place under the auspices of H.E. Macky Sall, Senegalese President and current Chairperson of the African Union.\n\nDuring the conference, he will deliver a keynote address, engage in several high-level bilateral meetings while helping drive discussions around a just energy transition in Africa.\n\nThe visits come ahead of the Africa Energy Week (October 18-21), which is likely to place considerable focus on natural gas and LNG.\n\nAfrican leaders are being urged to ‘fast track’ projects amid escalating supply constraints.\n\nThose underway include the 3.4Mtpa Coral Floating LNG project, the 12.8Mtpa Mozambique LNG project and the 1.2 Rovuma LNG project in Mozambique as well as the $4.8bn Grand Tortue Ahmeyim gas project co-developed by Senegal and Mauritania.\n\nCurrently operational terminals for the LNG exports in Africa have a combined capacity of 75m MT per year. Algeria presents the largest annual LNG export capacity in the continent, with 29.3m MT, followed by Nigeria with 22.2m MT.",
    "Germany rejects new negotiations over Namibia genocide": "The German government has not said much publicly in recent months about the reconciliation process between Germany and Namibia.\n\nSix years ago, both governments entered into negotiations about a formal German apology for the colonial-era killings of tens of thousands of the Herero and Nama people in what was once Germany South-West Africa. Historians describe it as the first genocide of the 20th century.\n\nNegotiators agreed on a draft agreement in May 2021, but neither government has yet signed. Right from the start, the document drew loud criticism from politicians and some descendants of the victims, who demanded fresh talks.\n\nNo fresh talks\n\nHowever, the German government has now officially rejected these demands. \"From the German government's point of view, the negotiations for the joined declaration with Namibia have been finalized, even though talks about specific modalities of its implementation are continuing,\" the government wrote in response to written questions submitted by Sevim Dagdelen, a Member of Germany's federal parliament from the aocialist Left Party.\n\n\"It is a sign of arrogance that the German government simply ignores the massive criticism from Namibia's parliament and the outrage of the descendants of the victims and leaves Namibia to deal with it,\" Dagdelen told DW.\n\nThen German foreign minister Heiko Maas announced the end of negotiations in May 2021\n\nA number of Herero and Nama representatives are likely to agree. In December, they had requested a meeting with Germany's foreign minister Annalena Baerbock to push for direct negotiations. They are angry that Germany is only ready to accept political, but not legal responsibility for the genocide.\n\nThey also criticize the €1.1 billion ($1.1 billion) rebuilding and development program that Germany is proposing to finance over 30 years. \"That is development cooperation. This is about financing projects and infrastructure, which is ok. But this deal does not get to the heart of the matter, it is not about justice and reconciliation,\" Nama activist Sima Luipert told German news magazine Der Spiegel in June this year.\n\nHereros and Namas are divided\n\nOther community representatives, however, have rejected demands for fresh talks. \"Protocol wise I don't think that a foreign government can enter into negotiations leading to an agreement with the citizens of a foreign country. Hence, reopening of the negotiation on genocide ... will not be accepted by our government, all OvaHerero, OvaMbanderu and Nama communities\", Ueriuka Tjikuua, a community representative who participated in the negotiations process, told DW.\n\nMany Hereros live in poverty\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding the draft agreement, the German government is already taking steps toward its implementation. This year's federal budget includes €35 million for development projects and €4 million for a foundation that is supposed to keep the memory of the genocide alive. Both sums are part of the €1.1 billion package.\n\nA spokeswoman for Germany's Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development told DW that the development projects would target the descendants of the victims. They cover areas such as land reform, agriculture, water, energy supply, and vocational training.\n\nDevelopment projects are underway\n\nHowever, it is still unclear when the projects will be up and running. \"These plans can only be implemented once the two foreign ministers have signed the joined declaration,\" the spokeswoman said. The ministry did not provide specific information on the state of implementation but told DW that it was in constant dialogue with the Namibian government.\n\nThe debate in Namibia's parliament was marred by protests\n\nThe Namibian government's present position on the draft agreement is also unclear.\n\nAngry Herero and Namas took the capital Windhoek after the negotiations were concluded in May last year. A parliamentary debate about the agreement in September 2021 was also accompanied by loud protests. The mood inside the chamber was equally emotional: Angry opposition members blasted the outcome of the negotiations, with even some MPs from the ruling SWAPO party voicing concern. So far, the government has not put the agreement to a vote in the national assembly.\n\n\"The fact that the government withdrew and also did not schedule another debate about it clearly shows how uneasy it feels, because it realized that it won't be easy,\" German-Namibian scholar Henning Melber told DW.\n\nNo vote in Germany's parliament?\n\nThe German government, however, has tried to remain confident. \"The Namibian government is sticking to the draft of the joined declaration even after the controversial debate in the Namibian national assembly,\" it wrote in its response to the parliamentary questions by the Left Party.\n\nGermany's lower parliament, the Bundestag, does not plan to vote on the agreement at all.\n\n\"It is correct that the fully negotiated joined declaration is not an agreement under international law and does not require ratification by the German Bundestag,\" the government wrote.\n\nMP Dagdelen is not happy with this position. \"Politically, it is more than appropriate that parliament deals with such a historic declaration, even if it is not necessary from a legal point of view,\" she told DW.\n\nHowever, whether German politicians get to vote on the agreement or not may be decided thousands of miles away. Namibia is scheduled to go to the polls in November 2024. Faced with declining popularity, the Namibian government is likely to avoid anything that could generate public anger in the run-up to elections. That could mean the joint declaration with Germany will have to wait.\n\nStreet Debate: The price of the genocide in Namibia\n\nEdited by: Chrispin Mwakideu\n\nThis aritcle was originally published in German.",

    "Skating breaks societal prejudice, empowers young people in Namibia’s capital": "People visit a site in Namibia's capital Windhoek on Sept. 27, 2020, the World Tourism Day. (Photo by Ndalimpinga Iita/Xinhua)\n\nSkating is empowering children living with disabilities to realize their full potential as well as improve inclusion while helping to reduce stigma and increase self-confidence in adolescents living in Namibia's capital Windhoek.Through Skate Aid, an international nonprofit making organization, young boys and girls from the Namibia Institute of Special Education are breaking societal prejudice and transforming community attitudes, shifting negative perceptions against persons with disabilities.For Thomas, a learner, growing up with a disability has been very challenging but skating has given him confidence and value. He no longer feels inferior and discriminated against.\"When we are skating, it does not matter if you are blind, deaf, rich or poor, black or white, we are all just the same. We speak the same language and follow the same rules on the court. I am happy to be a part of this team,\" he said.The 12-year-old says skating has not only changed his life but it has given him a purpose where he is excited about his future which he hopes will include the sport.\"Skating is a beautiful thing, when I see all these kids, we practice together and every time we teach each other and for those that do not understand they are learning sign language just so that we can communicate,\" he said.\"I am happy,\" he added.Thomas has been a part of the skaters since a skate park was built inside the Namibia Institute of Special Education in 2018 and he is at the park almost every day except on weekends when he rests.The Namibia Institute of Special Education consists of three schools, including the school for the visually impaired, the school for the hearing impaired, and the school for the cognitive impaired.Children from these three schools make use of the park, which is also open to the public.Through the skate park, these children have managed to find acceptance. Love and hope make them strive to be the best in their everyday life and possibly change their circumstances of being overlooked and not always prioritized.Sixteen-year-old Kamaya has not only learned how to skate, but he has also learned sign language which he says is a bonus because now he is able to communicate with his fellow teammates.\"When I first started skating, I struggled to communicate because I did not know any sign language but I made it a point to learn, and now I can greet. I would like to say that I know the basics. It is a good thing because I do not just skate with my teammates, now we can talk stories,\" he said.Kamaya is now a pro skater and can do different tricks which he is now trying to teach the younger less skilled teammates.According to Michael Kagola, a skate aid volunteer and coach, the skaters consist of a variety of age groups ranging from 8 to 19 who are not only from the Namibia Institute of Special Education but also from the surrounding communities.Karola, who is a teacher by profession, believes that skateboarding is helping mold these children into better individuals and also teaching them the values of teamwork while allowing children to understand that their talent and abilities can be developed through effort and consistency.\"We work with children from all walks of life including the hearing, visual and cognitive impaired,\" Kagola said.\"We want to empower and instill values in them which will better their lives. Skateboarding will teach them that you always get up when you fall. Just like when you are learning a trick, you fall but always get up. It will teach them how to overcome failure.\"The children are facing tough situations where most of them come from impoverished backgrounds, Kagola said.\"We want to empower kids, get them off the street and deter them from roaming around, we want them to use their free time doing something productive instead of having them engage in bad behavior.\"\"It is funny how a piece of concrete and some skateboards can change people's lives and build confidence and drive,\" Kagola said.Although skating is not yet recognized as a professional sport in Namibia, these children already feel like winners as they practice and perfect their skills.\"We hope that one day the sport will be recognized professionally but for now we will just use it the best way we can, that is to give these kids a skating board and empower them,\" Kagola said.Xinhua",
    "EU-like energy approach needed in Southern Africa, says Namibia presidential advisor": "JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – A collaborative energy approach, like that of the European Union (EU), is needed in Southern Africa, says Namibia presidential economic adviser James Mnyupe.\n\nAt least South Africa and Namibia should put together a case that shows seriousness about decarbonising sub Saharan Africa, says Mnyupe, with the two countries looking to share with the world the burden of building the required pipeline and transmission line infrastructure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nMnyupe, who was a panel member at the Hydrogen Economy Discussion, says EU-like collaborative regional and continental approaches are needed in the renewable energy and green hydrogen space.\n\nModerated by Allen & Overy counsel Gillian Niven, the other panel members were EU-South Africa trade policy officer Darryn Allan, International Renewable Energy Agency programme officer policy Emanuele Bianco, and RebelGroup Southern Africa senior consultant Laurens Cloete.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nMnyupe says African policy makers need to be aware of the different policy toolboxes needed for African countries playing different roles.\n\nFor example, Namibia is poised to be an exporter of green hydrogen, South Africa perhaps a net importer and others playing self-sufficiency roles.\n\n“If you look at Morocco, it may export but it has really large industries that it may need to decarbonise, and South Africa might very well be a good example of that as well.\n\n“Depending on what type of country you are, you will need to think strategically about the different pieces of legislation and policy that you would want to be championing.\n\n“For example, if you are an exporter like Namibia, you will be thinking very hard about securing offtake agreements with clientele countries,” he highlights.\n\nFor others, the focus will be on regulating pricing for the use of specific infrastructure, such as pipelines and ports, and the need for some of that infrastructure needing to be common-user infrastructure so that the original builder of the pipeline does not necessarily restrict access to others down the line.\n\nFrom an upstream perspective, there will be a need for collocating assets in a way that makes sense.\n\nNamibia, with both good wind and solar in one jurisdiction, will need to ensure that it puts legislation for special economic zones around the generating assets to facilitate industrialisation clusters or a hydrogen valley around the generation assets.\n\nThought needs to be given to the prospect of assembling wind blades close to where the wind turbines will be located to negate the need to transport these large pieces of infrastructure over long distances.\n\n“Figure out whether you are a net importer or a net exporter - something that I think is very important from an African perspective, as well as beginning to think about inter-regional trade,” he adds.\n\nHe foresees not only green molecules in the form of green hydrogen and its derivatives being transported around Southern Africa but also green electrons in the form of renewable energy.\n\nIt could be that South Africa will be importing some of the molecules from Namibia to decarbonise its hard-to-abate sectors.\n\n“The one thing I would like to remind all African States to bear in mind is that hydrogen is not purely a molecule play. When you deploy very large renewable energy assets at scale, you will be getting electron connectivity. You could capture some of that, use that to become self-sufficient but possibly to trade electrons as well into the Southern African Power Pool,\" Mnyupe highlights.\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa on 25 July spoke about South Africa possibly needing to consider importing electricity from neighbouring countries that have excess electricity.\n\n“If that electricity happens to be good, clean renewable energy that is cheap and affordable, I think that presents a really great opportunity for South Africa and its neighbours, such as Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. That’s what Africans need to start thinking about when looking at the hydrogen opportunity,\" he adds.\n\nBoth Namibia and South Africa are looking at green hydrogen business models, which could give rise to the Southern African Development Community (SADC) modelling its regulatory framework on that of the EU.\n\nWhile the US and China have big enough economies to do things on their own, the countries of Africa need to consider collaborating in the way the EU is doing.\n\nHe believes African countries will benefit from talking to one another and putting standards in place and then allowing States to play their own roles.\n\n“You do have things like the African Green Hydrogen Alliance being put together but I believe that at African Union (AU) member State level, we do need a coordinated, potentially continental approach to this.\n\n“At the very least you would want a regional approach to some of these endeavours. For example, SADC states, I believe need to talk to one another and I can tell you why. If you look at the EU, they are looking, for example, at building backbone pipeline infrastructure right across the continent that can take electrons from Italy and Spain to Germany, and from the port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands to Germany as well.\n\nThat level of coordination and effort sharing in building inter-regional assets comes with significant benefits and in his view, Namibia, and South Africa, could collaborate on building a pipeline from Lüderitz into Boegoebaai that extends to Sasol in Secunda.\n\nSuch a pipeline of 2 300 km could cost anywhere between €6-billion and €6.5-billion, and moves could be made to jointly strengthen the transmission line network as well.\n\n“In a nutshell, an SADC approach will be needed and I do believe that at AU level, there should be conversations with the EU specifically on standards, certifications to ensure that Africa, as a supplier continent, is speaking to the EU as a potential importer continent.\n\nHe says Namibia wants to make some announcements at the United Nations Climate Change Conference from November 6 to18 in Egypt as it collaborates with the EU “and we’d encourage our peers and our neighbours to do the same”, he adds.",

I worked with former MTF students and honestly, I’m so grateful. Thank you to MultiChoice Namibia for believing in and supporting me from the beginning until the premiere,” said Esther Beukes.\n\nStarring Zambian radio and television presenter, Michie Malambo as the protagonist of the film and stepping into her first role as an actress in Miss Understood, she effortlessly portrays and narrates a troubled character in the African context.\n\nThe film has already been nominated at the Women Festival in Nigeria for Best Short Film and has won the Best International Short Film at the Festival International de Kinshasha, among other accolades.\n\nSharing advice to upcoming filmmakers, the screening consisted of a panel discussion featuring Esther Beukes and clinical psychologist Cynthia Beukes.\n\nHits: 26",
    "Namibia’s Namibian Investment Promotion Development Board (NIPDB) Joins African Energy Week 2022 as Diamond Sponsor": "The African Energy Week (AEW) (www.AECWeek.com) 2022 conference and exhibition – Africa’s premier event for the oil and gas sector which will be taking place from October 18-21 this year in Cape Town – will serve to drive long-term energy investment in Africa with the aim of ushering in a new era of socioeconomic growth. In line with this objective, and as a facilitator of improved local and foreign direct investment in Namibia, the Namibian Investment Promotion Development Board (NIPDB) will be participating as a diamond sponsor at this year’s edition of the AEW conference.\n\nRepresenting one of Africa’s fastest growing energy markets, the NIPDB’s presence and participation as a diamond sponsor at Africa’s biggest event for the energy sector will be crucial for shaping dialogue around current investment trends as well as the challenges and opportunities present across both Namibia’s and the continent’s energy sector.\n\nThe discovery of sizable oil and gas reserves by TotalEnergies at the Venus 1-X well; and Shell and Qatar Energy at the Graff-1 well in early 2022 – as part of a massive exploration campaign launched by the Namibian government to maximize the exploitation of local energy resources to meet local and regional energy needs – has opened up significant opportunities across the entire energy value chain in Namibia. In addition to realizing the potential of the country’s oil and gas prospects, the discoveries, along with the country’s favorable investment climate, have positioned Namibia as lucrative investment destination in 2022 and beyond.\n\nMoreover, with major players expanding upstream investments across Namibia’s untapped hydrocarbons-rich basins – in search of similar discoveries made at Venus and Graff-1 – massive investment opportunities remain across exploration and production landscapes. By shaping critical conversations in keynote addresses and networking forums, NIPDB will highlight these opportunities to regional, continental and international energy stakeholders and investors whilst promoting the role the country’s oil and gas will play in making energy poverty history across the continent by 2030. For Namibia, the discoveries promise a new era of economic growth on the back of oil and gas while for Africa, new supply streams at a time when the continent desperately requires new sources of energy.\n\nWhile Namibia’s oil and gas industry undergoes impressive growth, the country’s green hydrogen sector has also emerged as one of the world’s most attractive and fastest growing markets. Backed by abundant solar and wind potential, Namibia’s burgeoning green hydrogen industry has the potential to supply rapidly growing demand at global scale whilst driving sustainable economic development and GDP growth at regional level. Backed by an attractive regulatory environment and the country’s strategic location to become a green hydrogen exporter for international markets such as Europe, Namibia’s green hydrogen market – kickstarted with the development of a $9.4 billion project with Hyphen Hydrogen Energy in the Tsau/Khaeb National Park and recent plans to develop four hydrogen valleys in the Erongo, Karas, Otjozondjupa and Kunene regions – is headed for further expansion.\n\nAs such, the NIPDB is set to drive the green-hydrogen narrative at AEW 2022, leading high-profile discussions around the role a combination of private and public sector investments, and continental and regional investment partners will play for stimulating market development, growth and expansion. With the company set to host an Invest in Namibia side event at AEW 2022, key insight into current and emerging investment opportunities, the role Namibian energy plays in Africa’s energy future and strategies for securing foreign investment in 2022 and beyond will be deliberated.\n\n“Namibia represents one of Africa’s biggest emerging energy markets, with sizeable investment and large-scale developments kicking off across the entire energy sector and value chain. On the oil and gas front, the country is witnessing newfound growth on the back of two historic discoveries made this year while on the green hydrogen front, Namibia-German investment partnerships lay the foundation for accelerated industry growth. Largely driven by the NIPDB, Namibia has established itself as one of the top energy investment destinations worldwide, and the NIPDB will share further insight at AEW 2022,” states NJ Ayuk, the Executive Chairman of the African Energy Chamber (AEC).\n\nUnder the theme, ‘Exploring and Investing in Africa’s Energy Future while Driving an Enabling Environment,’ AEW 2022 will host NIPDB in high-level meetings and panel discussions where the organization will make a strong case on the massive investment required in order to fast-track Namibia’s hydrocarbon boom. Through these sessions and the Invest in Namibia side event, the country’s investment landscape will be presented to regional and international players.\n\nDistributed by APO Group on behalf of African Energy Week (AEW).\n\nContact Details:\n\nFor sales related inquiries please contact [email protected]\n\nFor attendance related inquiries contact [email protected]\n\nFor speaker related inquiries contact [email protected]\n\nFor media related inquiries contact [email protected]\n\nAbout AEW 2022:\n\nAEW 2022 is the AEC’s annual conference, exhibition and networking event.

    "Breweries revenue shoots up by 14%": "Namibia Breweries Limited (NBL) recorded net a revenue increase of 14.1% to N$3.021 billion for the year ended 30 June 2022.\n\nDespite a decline in Namibian beer volumes, the company’s financials were strong on the back of increased beer volume growth in South Africa, encouraging exports and sound cost management.\n\nAccording to the company, Namibian beer volumes declined by 1.5% as inflationary pressure across all sectors of the Namibian economy continued to stretch consumers’ disposable income.\n\n“While overall volumes for NBL increased by 12%, beer volumes in Namibia decreased by 1.5% against 2021, while volumes to South Africa increased by 60.6% compared to the prior fiscal year,” NBL managing director Marco Wenk said.\n\nBeyond South Africa, Tanzania remains NBL’s largest export market, although, as with most export markets, significant logistics cost increases negatively impacted export profitability compared to the prior fiscal year.\n\nHits: 8",
    "Chief Hijangua – Namibia’s first opera premieres in Windhoek": "Comprising young local musicians, Vox Vitae Singers will premiere Namibia’s first opera at the National Theatre of Namibia (NTN) in Windhoek on Frida and Saturday.\n\nTitled Chief Hijangua and performed in Otjiherero and German, the opera includes international musicians from Germany and South Africa.\n\nComposed and conducted by Vox Vitae Singers’ Founder, Eslon Hindundu, Chief Hijangua is based on a story that has survived through oral tradition over generations in Namibia.\n\nThe story is about a Namibian prince’s tragic and dramatic journey. Heartbroken, Hijangua leaves his tribe and stumbles upon a young German girl, who saves him and later falls in love with him. The German girl’s community disapproves of their relationship. Hijangua is banished and told to return to his homeland. However, his return to his tribe takes a tragic course full of misery, more heartbreak, drama, and death.\n\nSponsored by Bank Windhoek, Chief Hijangua is set to star Sakiwe Mksoana, Henrike Henoch, Natasha Ndjiharine, Monde Masimini, Rheinaldt Tshepo Moagi, Galilei Njembo, and Yonwaba Mbo.\n\n“This project has the potential to massively impact, preserve, develop and create a new idiom in Namibian Classical Music,” said Hindundu. “We envisaged it to reignite the love of music in the hearts of the Namibian community, preserving and reflecting on the journey that Namibians have taken for the current and future generations.”\n\nRegarding the Bank’s support, Hindundu said he is grateful that Bank Windhoek believes in Namibian arts and that this encourages younger artists to pursue their dreams. “As an artist, we do not get much support. But seeing that Bank Windhoek has come on board to support this project is a blessing, and we are all thankful,” said Hindundu.\n\nThe Bank’s Head of Corporate Social Investments (CSI), Sponsorship and Events, Bronwyn Moody, said that as a connector of positive change, Bank Windhoek believes in and supports arts development.\n\n“Composing and having a Namibian opera can preserve and inspire many musicians, bring many nations together. Thus, supporting the staging of the first Namibian opera is a huge privilege. It preserves the treasure of Namibian classical folk music,” she said. “We encourage all Namibia to come to the NTN to experience the first Namibian opera.”\n\nAn opera is a staged drama set to music in its entirety, made up of vocal pieces with instrumental accompaniment and usually with orchestral overtures and interludes. The Chief Hijangua opera was developed by an international team of artists around Hindundu. He is supported by the German director Kim Mira Meyer and the German author Nikolaus Frei.\n\nWith a cast of over a hundred participants, Chief Hijangua is made up of three phases. Following the Windhoek premiere, Munich’s Germany performance is also planned for 2023. The artistic team was inspired by Namibia’s colonial history and traditional folk tales of the country.\n\nTickets are available at Pick ‘n Pay and Web ticket, N$100 for students, N$250 for the public, and N$500 for VIPs.\n\nHits: 129",
    "Namibia utilises One Health for rabies control including oral rabies vaccines for dogs": "Interview with Rauna Athingo (Namibia)\n\nThe northern part of Namibia in particular has been identified as a rabies hotspot, and many rabies cases, both in humans and animals (dogs and livestock especially), have occurred there in the last years.\n\n\n\n© Dr. Rauna Athingo\n\nIn 2006, Dr Rauna Athingo started working as a state veterinarian, responsible for disease control in the Oshana region – one of the regions in the north of the country where rabies is inflicting a particularly heavy burden. She was able to observe how vulnerable children were being exposed to rabid dogs and puppies in particular. At that time, she remembers, the Directorate of Veterinary Services did not have a strategy on how to handle rabies cases, and this made their work very difficult. Dr Athingo was part of a driving force in developing Namibia’s National Rabies Control Strategy, which provides guidance to all veterinarians and public health professionals in how to deal with rabies cases.\n\n“My vision is of a Namibia free from dog-mediated rabies, saving human lives and saving the livelihoods of farmers who also suffer as a result of mass livestock losses due to rabies.” – Dr Rauna Athingo, Chief Veterinarian for Animal Disease Control in the Directorate of Veterinary services, Namibia.\n\nRabies is a prime example of a disease at the animal-human-environment interface: cases in dogs, humans and livestock are directly correlated. To make elimination of rabies possible, therefore, different sectors have to collaborate and work together.\n\n© Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute (FLI)\n\nIn 2015, to do just that, and in an attempt to address the increasing number of rabies cases, Namibia started to implement a One Health approach. The relevant authorities identified the need for collaboration between sectors and completely changed their approach to rabies control, by improving coordination and collaboration as well as communication at the human-animal-environment interface. Representatives from various sectors, such as human and animal health, education, environment and academia, took part in the formulation of Namibia’s strategy. Many activities were implemented under the One Health approach, both nationally and also in cooperation with neighbouring countries like Angola.\n\nCommitments from both the private and public sectors enabled Namibia to work towards the global goal of zero dog-mediated rabies cases by 2030, increasing awareness among communities and improving accessibility to post-exposure prophylaxis, especially in children and poor communities, given that rabies has devastating impacts not only on health but also on livelihoods. The financial burdens for bite victims, for example, include direct travel costs, as a number of trips to a healthcare facility are needed to complete the post-exposure prophylaxis schedule, and also the loss of income that can result from exposure. As well as this, rabies exposure can inflict a heavy psychological burden on families, and dogs too can be associated with this traumatic experience, resulting in long-term fear for humans.\n\nConsidering these economic, social and individual implications, controlling rabies at its source (i.e. the dogs themselves) is cheaper than providing postexposure prophylaxis. It also helps to empower communities – if community members understand the dangers of rabies, and ways to control it, they can contribute themselves to saving lives.\n\nDr Athingo’s message is clear: “Kick out rabies from Namibia – vaccinate your pet”.\n\n\n\n\n\n© Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute (FLI)\n\nFriedrich-Loeffler-Institute (FLI) – Using oral rabies vaccines (value and use)\n\nFor more than five years now, the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute (FLI) has been supporting Namibia’s efforts to control rabies in various areas. Besides carrying out assessments, epidemiological analyses, and building capacity at the laboratory side, vaccination has been a particular focus.\n\nCurrently, rabies elimination efforts rely on mass dog vaccination by the parenteral route, which means injecting a dose of rabies vaccine under the skin. Vaccination campaigns usually rely on owners bringing their dog to vaccination points. However, free-roaming and stray dogs are sometimes hard to catch and this means that vaccination targets, to control rabies in the dog population, may not be reached.\n\nTo increase herd immunity, these free-roaming and stray dogs need to be specifically targeted by vaccination campaigns, and oral rabies vaccination (ORV) of dogs is one possible solution in such cases.\n\n\n\n© Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute (FLI)\n\n“With safe, efficacious and well accepted oral vaccine baits available, ORV has the potential to become a game changer in situations where parenteral vaccination alone cannot stop transmission within the dog population.” - Dr Conrad Freuling, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute\n\nBefore using the vaccine in a larger field trial, colleagues from the FLI, in conjunction with the University of Namibia, tested the immune responses triggered by oral vaccine baits in local Thai and Namibian dog populations 1,2.\n\nDuring a field trial in communal areas of northern Namibia, both veterinary staff and dog owners expressed their appreciation for this particular approach to vaccination. When it comes to oral vaccination, however, bait acceptance has to be considered. Dogs will only go for “tasty” baits. Fortunately for the trial, a great many dogs that were offered bait were interested. They ingested them and were then considered as being vaccinated 3.\n\nORV can complement current parenteral vaccination strategies and go a long way in making up for the lack of access to crucial parts of the dog populations that rabies elimination programs have to contend with.\n\nDr Thomas Müller of the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute said, “The partnership with our Namibian colleagues has been and continues to be very fruitful. We are confident that the promising results from our field assessments of ORV will pave the way for other countries in Africa and elsewhere to integrate ORV into their rabies control programmes.”\n\n\n\n© Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute (FLI)\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n",
    "WHO’s GBV clinical handbook an eye-opener for doctors in Namibia": "When Dr Ifeolu Oyedele first learned that he would be going for training on the World Health Organization (WHO)’s ‘Clinical handbook for the health care of survivors subjected to intimate partner violence and/or sexual violence’ he did not think he would learn anything new from the session.\n\nIn fact, he was already sensitized through his medical training to see signs of abuse and trauma. It was only while attending the training session in September 2021 that it dawned on him the seriousness of Gender-Based Violence and Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) as well as the trauma it causes to the victims.\n\n“The training opened my eyes to what happens after we see patients of GBV. The impact the training made was that I was now starting to give the sexual assault cases a higher priority,” said Oyedele, the Acting Senior Medical Officer at the Rundu State Hospital. He adds that before the training he and other doctors at the hospital did not really prioritize GBV victims.\n\nBefore, patients who would come to the Rundu State hospital for a sexual assault case had to wait for long hours before a doctor would attend to them. Patients were told to wait for the doctors’ lunch hour to be seen because of the high number of patients doctors at the state health facilities attend daily. This changed because Oyedele realized ‘the sensitive nature’ of these cases.\n\n“We would schedule their appointments from lunchtime but now after the training instead of giving her (victim) an appointment I would just see her as immediately as possible, basically I would finish my current patient and then see them and do the rape kit,” he explains.\n\nHe further elaborates: “My eyes were just opened to the sensitive nature of the issue and that they are going through a lot of psychological stress and trauma and telling them to wait, and they haven’t bathed or showered is a bit insensitive. I now do it as soon as feasible”.\n\nOyedele works in the gynaecology department and when doctors in other departments pick up cases of GBV or IPV they are referred to him. “It’s only my department that is dealing with these cases because we are the ones with gynaecological experience,” explains Oyedele.\n\nOyedele is one of 282 healthcare professionals trained in the clinical handbook nationwide. The purpose of the training is to orient health professionals, primarily doctors and nurses at government healthcare facilities to identify signs of abuse in patients.\n\nThe doctors and nurses are trained to see clinical cues and identify violence that healthcare providers are likely to miss in their patients. The doctors and nurses are also trained to be empathetic when dealing with victims of GBV and IPV.\n\nDr Leonard Kabongo is a Chief Medical Officer in the Erongo region. He was also trained on the ‘Clinical Handbook on the Health Care of Survivors Subjected to Intimate Partner Violence and/or Sexual Violence, Namibia’.\n\n“In the past, all we did was a quick physical examination of the patient and concluded that there was no sign of rape or sexual intercourse and that was it. But, now we know that GBV and IPV are not always physical,” explains Kabongo. Through the handbook, Kabongo has developed the ability to listen to his patients. He was also able to transfer these skills and other lessons provided in the handbook to other doctors countrywide as a trainer of trainees.\n\n“It is very important to listen because the story of the assault or the violence is actually guiding you on how to approach this individual (survivor) and where exactly your focus will be as you are listening,” explains Kabongo. By actively listening to his patients, Kabongo has also learned to empathise with his patients.\n\nTimely intervention\n\nDr Alice Kabongo, is a Senior Medical Officer at the Gobabis State hospital. She says that doctors in the state health facilities have to attend to many patients and that sometimes makes it difficult to prioritise sexual assault cases.\n\n“Although we know that GBV cases should not wait because it's an emergency we are sometimes forced to use the triage system where we prioritise who we will see. For example, if it's a young patient we will attend to them at whatever time we have that day and if it’s an older patient we let them sleep in the ward and we see them in the morning,” explained Alice.\n\nMeanwhile, Kabongo (Leonard) feels that even if the state hospitals are busy, GBV survivors equally need urgent attention. “We do a triage to attend to patients who need urgent medical attention, including survivors of IPV and GBV because they are also hurt emotionally and they need support and a place of safety,” Kabongo explained. GBV and IPV are emergencies, he emphasized.\n\nIn addition, time is of importance, especially in the case of a sexual assault. “If you wait too long to attend to the patient you are losing that opportunity to prevent infections, so there are medications that they need to receive, prophylaxis which they need to receive to prevent certain types of infections that could be the result of the assault,” he adds.\n\nEqually, waiting too long to attend to a sexual assault patient increases the chances of losing forensic evidence. The result is that there will not be sufficient evidence to prove in court that a sexual assault has occurred. “Forensic evidence actually disappears with time so the more time has elapsed the more the evidence is gone,” adds Kabongo.\n\nForensic kit\n\nDr Oyedele and Alice both have been using the rape kit for years. Oyedele says that he studied the instructions on the rape kit manual and has been doing it accordingly. “I just followed the manual that comes with the rape kit. This has already been part of the work I do so it didn’t add to the workload,” Oyedele explained. However, not every doctor knows how to use one, says Kabongo. The training was also helpful to the doctors who did not know how to use the forensic kit, Kabongo adds.\n\n“Most of the doctors are not really exposed to forensic examination, for example, how do you collect the evidence appropriately and how do you defend yourself in the court of law if you are summoned to be an expert witness,” he explained.\n\nExposing the doctors to the forensic kit during the training has increased their confidence, adds Kabongo. “And that’s another powerful component of the training that has actually helped to appropriately select the evidence. In the past, we have had cases dismissed due to a lack of evidence, including tampering with evidence. Now, people are aware of when they should open the rape kit,” he said.\n\nIn the event that they are summoned to court regarding a GBV or IPV case, doctors who have undergone the training know what type of evidence to present. “If I present myself in court and I’m being asked questions by lawyers I know how to respond. All these come as a component of the clinical handbook and I think it has really empowered doctors to be able to defend their cases effectively,” Kabongo explains.\n\nAbuse knows no gender or age\n\nWhile it is common for women and girls to be the faces of GBV and IPV, they are not the only ones who experience abuse, Kabongo emphasizes. The clinical handbook training touches on the human being and this includes men and boys.\n\n“Men and boys can also be subjected to this kind of violence and they too need care,” he adds. Oyedele says that the patients he sees for sexual assault and other forms of GBV are mostly women of reproductive age.\n\n“The youngest patient I saw for suspected abuse is three years old and the oldest is 41 years old,” Oyedele says. He has been keeping records of GBV patients he has attended since October 2020. “Even if they are picked up from somewhere they refer them to me,” he adds.\n\nGBV survivors must be protected\n\nMeanwhile, Alice credits the GBV training on the clinical handbook for her alertness and ability to pick up subtle cues and probe suspected abuse. “We take the patient’s comprehensive history to rule out abuse,” she says.\n\nStill, she feels that more needs to be done to protect survivors of GBV and IPV. People who report to the hospital for obvious abuse need to be protected, she says. At the moment, these patients’ first contact point is the casualty department where everyone can see they “have been abused,” says Alice.\n\n“GBV is a sensitive issue and we need a place where these people can be seen and received. For now, we send them to a ward or in the Old Theatre of the hospital when we suspect abuse. But we are advocating for a corner where they can be seen privately,” says Alice. She also feels that more medical professionals should be trained and a designated doctor should be assigned for these cases.\n\n“The only issue is that we are working in an environment where there is a shortage of doctors. In other hospitals, there is literally a separate doctor who attends to those cases and doesn't have to attend to any other patients,” agrees Oyedele. The response to the handbook has been overwhelming with some doctors requesting more training, concludes Kabongo.\n\nThe ‘Clinical Handbook on the Health Care of Survivors Subjected to Intimate Partner Violence and/or Sexual Violence, Namibia’ is an initiative of the WHO in collaboration with UN Women, the United Nations Population Fund and the Ministry of Health and Social Services. The handbook draws on the work of professionals who are dedicated to preventing and responding to GBV.",

    "Loss-making Meatco gets bailout": "MEAT Corporation of Namibia (Meatco) chief executive officer (CEO) Mwilima Mushokobanji says the pre-tax loss of N$206 million the company reported in its latest annual financial results last week were expected, as a result of Namibia's recent drought period.\n\nMeatco has in the meantime received a government bailout of N$200 million.\n\nMushokobanji yesterday said Meatco expected the reported loss of N$206 million as the company's revenue dropped from N$1,7 billion to N$752 million over two financial years.\n\nMushokobanji confirmed that Meatco's loss was stated in an independent auditor's report on the company's latest financial results.\n\n“We knew because we came from the drought,” he said.\n\nMushokobanji said the loss was a result of the drought, which drastically reduced the throughput of slaughter cattle.\n\n“In our projections, what was very clear come 2020/21, we were going to have a serious throughput problem, because we have lost a lot of cattle due to drought, and then for 2021/22, we only slaughtered 36 000 head of cattle,” he said.\n\nMeatco's revenue declined from N$1,7 billion in 2019/20 to N$873 million the following year, and to N$752 million in 2021/22.\n\nTo break even, Meatco needs to slaughter at least 60 000 head of cattle annually, which need to be exported to international markets.\n\n“If we could have slaughtered 60 000 cattle, we could have wiped the loss you see here,” he said.\n\nMushokobanji said the only reason Meatco had N$1,7 billion in revenue in 2019/20 was because the company's slaughtering figures were at 116 000 head of cattle, after farmers were advised to get rid of most of their livestock.\n\nHe said the government has given Meatco N$200 million, which would not constitute additional debt.\n\n“The N$200 million shareholder injection during the 2023 financial year has significantly improved the debt-to-equity ratio,” he said. The auditors were concerned about Meatco's debt, which includes a debt of N$431 million with the Development Bank of Namibia (DBN).\n\nThe company has over the past financial year reduced its bank overdraft by 32% – from N$102 million to N$69 million.\n\nMushokobanji said a loan Meatco has with Bank Windhoek was reduced from N$21 million to N$8 million.\n\n“This loan is now fully settled,” he said, as the government bailout will assist with that.\n\nHe said Meatco has reduced a loan of N$200 million with the DBN from N$171 million to N$147 million over the past year.\n\nGOVERNMENT 'CURSED'\n\nEconomist Omu Kakujaha-Matundu says it is a well-known fact that where the government puts its fingerprints things do not go well.\n\n“Air Namibia, the RCC, TransNamib, and the list continues. The culture of no consequences and pumping public money into bottomless pits is well entrenched,” he says.\n\nKakujaha-Matundu says with Meatco's status as a state-owned enterprise, one would not expect much from its turnaround.\n\n“And one would not expect much in the future as competition is breathing down Meatco's neck. Hopefully the northern communal area-West African deal could turn its fortunes. Let's keep our fingers crossed,” he says.\n\nDISCUSSION NEEDED\n\nMushokobanji yesterday said Meatco needs to discuss its auditors' questions about the company's status, as a going concern with the auditors because they are mainly concerned about the volumes of slaughter stock that come to the abattoir.\n\n“We need to clarify that with the auditors in terms of what they meant . . . they are concerned about the volumes which affect the bottom line,” he said.\n\nHe said because drought has affected Meatco's business over the last three years, it will continue to do so.\n\n“What they mean is that as much as it looks like they are building the national stock, the auditor is worried about throughput moving forward into the future. We gave the auditors confidence,” he said.\n\nGOING FORWARD\n\nMeatco continues to downsize its staff complement to survive the company's financial position.\n\nThe company has retrenched about 80 employees, which the CEO said has saved it salary expenditure amounting to N$15 million.\n\n“No salary increases were given to senior and middle management staff for the last two years,” Mushokobanji said.\n\nThe company's monthly salaries were reduced from N$14 million in 2018 to N$11 million in 2022. That is N$40 million per year less than what was recorded in 2018.\n\n“Total staff reduced from 975 in 2018 to 738 in 2022. Permanent staff will be reduced from 826 in 2018 to 577 in 2022,” he said.\n\nThis comes as more than 50 employees at Meatco's abattoir at Katima Mulilo are demanding that the company employ them on a fixed-term basis with benefits.\n\nMeatco is expected to have its upcoming annual general meeting on 30 September at Otjiwarongo.",

    "Jane Katjavivi obituary": "My friend Jane Katjavivi, who has died aged 69 after a short bout of ill-health, dedicated her life to Namibia. She and I first met in the 1970s when we were both working in the London office of the South West Africa People’s Organisation (Swapo), the liberation movement fighting to end South Africa’s illegal occupation of South West Africa.\n\nSwapo later formed the government of independent Namibia. After moving to the country at independence, Jane forged a unique role for herself. Six months after she arrived she started the first Namibian publishing house – New Namibia Books.\n\nJane was born in Leeds, one of four children of John Coles, a paper merchant, and his wife, Rosina (nee Pocock). She grew up in a family whose strong Christian ethics influenced her for the rest of her life.\n\nOn leaving Leeds girls’ high school, she began undergraduate studies in English literature at the University of Sussex, in the School of African and Asian Studies, later completing a master’s degree in African studies at Birmingham University. These studies, and a year as scholarship officer for the World University Service, an NGO that campaigned for racial and social justice, set her on her course.\n\nIn 1976 Jane went to work as information officer in Swapo’s small London office with Peter Katjavivi, its representative in UK and Europe. Work was intense with many crises at the height of the liberation struggle. Along the way, Jane and Peter fell in love, and in 1980 they moved to Oxford for Peter’s doctorate. They married in 1981 and a few years later their son Perivi was born.\n\nPeter’s university appointments took their family to Finland and the US, where their daughter, Isabel, was born, before they moved to Namibia for independence elections in 1989.\n\nJane’s publishing house successfully championed Namibian and African authors, especially giving a voice to women. Though publishers elsewhere warned her the market in Namibia was too small, Jane’s bestsellers included Last Steps to Uhuru by David Lush (1993) and The Price of Freedom by Ellen Ndeshi Namhila (1997). In 1994 she opened the busy New Namibia Bookshop in Windhoek.\n\nA member of the Communist party in her youth, Jane nonetheless moved seamlessly into new roles, as Peter became an MP, the founding chancellor of the University of Namibia, an ambassador, and the speaker of the National Assembly. As with everything, Jane performed with dedication and panache.\n\nThe irony of the anti-colonial campaigner becoming wife of an ambassador in Brussels and Berlin, at the heart of colonial Europe, was not lost on her. As a radical young woman in London, she had probably imagined a different kind of life – but she never lost her core political values.\n\nIn 2008, returning from Europe, Jane founded the University of Namibia’s publishing arm – an important and lasting legacy. She never stopped making things happen to help build the new Namibia. She combined this successfully with being a wife, mother and grandmother.\n\nShe is survived by Peter, their children, and her siblings, Sarah, John and Helen."
