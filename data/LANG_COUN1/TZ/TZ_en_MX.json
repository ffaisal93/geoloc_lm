    "At UN, Mexico proposes a high-level diplomatic delegation to mediate between Russia and Ukraine": "The proposed caucus would include Pope Francis, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Secretary General Antonio Guterres.\n\nSuch a caucus was necessary Mr. Ebrard explained, because the war in Ukraine had triggered a cascade of global consequences, including food and fuel shortages, disruptions in the world economy, polarized the multilateral system and led to a climate of mistrust and international uncertainty.\n\n“Just when it seemed like the recovery from the pandemic was on the horizon, we saw the war in Ukraine with the risk of a nuclear incident and catastrophic potential consequences,” he said.\n\nThe Mexican Foreign Minister underlined the paralysis of the UN Security Council the face of the conflict, highlighting its inaction to put a stop to armed aggression by one of its own members and to direct a diplomatic process in search of a peaceful and negotiated solution.\n\nFurther, he noted that the Security Council has not been able to guarantee necessary humanitarian assistance, nor has it been able to fully support the work of the Secretary General and other actors to manage access to grains and fertilizers produced by the Russian Federation and Ukraine.\n\nProposal to mediate conflict\n\n“For these reasons, the President of Mexico, proposes that a delegation or caucus of Heads of State and Government, that would encourage and accompany the efforts by the Secretary General to promote peaceful and trust-building measures between the Russian Federation and Ukraine. This will allow us to make use of a peaceful resolution mechanism that would be within the framework of the UN Charter”, he stated.\n\nForeign Minister Ebrard explained that the intention is to create a diplomatic channel that complements those that already exist to interact with the parties in conflict, reduce tensions and channel mediation.\n\nMexico has already presented its proposal to the parties involved and will continue to make the necessary consultations “with the sole purpose of being able to contribute, as an impartial actor in good faith” and to generate greatest support for the efforts and good offices of the Secretary General and the Caucus. In this regard, Mr Ebrard said: “We hope that the creation of this caucus will have the support of the UN’s Member States.”\n\nAbuse of veto\n\nMr. Ebrard attributed the paralysis of the Security Council to the abuse of the so-called right to veto by some of its permanent members. He recalled that his country, together with France, has proposed an initiative that asks the permanent members to refrain from resorting to the veto in situations of mass atrocities. The proposal has so far received the support of 106 States.\n\nIn addition, Mexico and 83 other States promoted an accountability mechanism by which the General Assembly is urged to hold an emergency session every time a veto is registered in the Security Council and to invite the authors of that veto to explain their position.\n\n“We must now make a decision about whether or not we want to take further steps to prevent this system from suffering greater paralysis in the face of mass suffering of people,” he said.\n\nRestoring trust\n\nTo conclude, Foreign Minister Ebrard stressed that the door to political dialogue and diplomatic negotiation cannot be closed. “Current international tensions are not going to be resolved by force. We must ensure political understanding and trust-building mechanisms. Yes, restoring trust is one of our biggest challenges,” he added.\n\nIn this regard, he expressed his country's conviction that the UN continues to be a unique tool of the international community for the peaceful resolution of conflicts and progress towards sustainable development.",
    "U.S. farmers urge Washington to challenge Mexico's looming ban on GM corn": "A trailer truck is loaded with yellow corn imported from Brazil at a warehouse in the port of Tuxpan, in Veracruz state, Mexico September 23, 2022. REUTERS/Yahir Ceballos\n\nMEXICO CITY, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Farmers in the United States are urging their government to challenge a looming Mexican ban on genetically modified (GM) corn under a regional free trade agreement, warning of billions of dollars of economic damage to both countries.\n\nA late 2020 decree by Mexico President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador would phase out GM corn and the herbicide glyphosate by 2024. Supporters of the ban say GM seeds can contaminate Mexico's age-old native varieties, and point to research showing adverse effects of glyphosate.\n\nMexico prides itself as the birthplace of modern corn but it imports about 17 million tonnes of U.S. corn a year and is on track to import even more this year, experts said.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nSome in Mexico's government, including Agriculture Minister Victor Villalobos, have signaled that yellow corn imports for livestock feed will not be disrupted. U.S. farmers remain wary since no official document states that, according to a U.S. agriculture official familiar with recent meetings with Mexican officials.\n\nAlso, Lopez Obrador this month said firmly: \"We do not accept GMO corn.\"\n\nCorn for human consumption, including white corn used in food products like tortillas, accounts for between 18% and 20% of Mexico's total U.S. corn imports. There are still questions about whether such GM imports will be eliminated by 2024.\n\nMexico's health regulator COFEPRIS has not authorized new strains of glyphosate-resistant GM corn seeds for import since 2018. The National Corn Growers Association, representing U.S. farmers, wants the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) to launch a dispute settlement proceeding under the USMCA trade pact, which includes Canada and Mexico.\n\nAngus R. Kelly, the association's director of public policy, trade and biotechnology, said it objects to the \"precedent-setting nature of the decrees\" and to Mexico rejecting biotech crop traits \"without any scientific basis.\"\n\nWashington could potentially raise a dispute under the agriculture chapter of the USMCA stipulating cooperation between members on an individual government's regulation of imports, according to Raul Urteaga, a former Mexican government official and founder of consulting group Global Agrotrade Advisors.\n\nA dispute settlement can apply under some USMCA chapters when a country considers one member government has nullified or impaired a benefit that was in place when the pact was signed.\n\nMexico's agriculture ministry and the U.S. embassy in Mexico declined to comment. The USTR and the USDA did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nBiotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO), representing biotech companies including Bayer, said it \"supported the (U.S.) administration taking enforcement action on Mexico’s treatment of agricultural biotechnology\" if dialogue fails.\n\nFederico Zerboni, Argentina-based president of agriculture chamber MAIZALL which sent a delegation to Mexico in August, said denial of new GM seeds made it seem like Mexico's regulator favors a \"very old and unfeasible production system to feed the world.\"\n\nCOFEPRIS, in a statement to Reuters said its decisions were based on \"scientific evidence and risk assessments.\"\n\nIn 2020, Bayer agreed to pay billions of dollars to settle lawsuits by people who claimed they were harmed by its weedkiller.\n\nA March report by the U.S. consulting firm World Perspectives Inc projected that Mexico's ban could cost the country $4.4 billion over 10 years for corn imports, push the price of tortillas up 42% by the second year and cause major risks to food security.\n\nThe United States could see a $16.5 billion drop in economic output over 10 years, the report found.

    "Mexico could turn gig workers into full-time employees": "In the coming days, the Mexican government is set to discuss an amendment to force delivery and ride-hailing apps to make gig workers into formal employees, which could affect the country’s estimated 350,000 to 500,000 delivery workers and ride-hailing drivers. Mexico’s labor department, known as the STPS, will introduce a proposal to Congress, aimed at reforming the federal labor law, which has the support of government-recognized gig worker unions and some independent workers’ organizations.\n\nBut some independent gig workers’ groups, who do not fit the union registration requirements or don’t want to be legally constituted as one, have been vocal in their opposition. They worry that the government is primarily interested in higher tax collection and increasing membership dues for the official unions, without dealing with workers’ real concerns.\n\nThe proposed law, as drafted by the labor department with the support of official unions, requires a set amount of working hours for employees, plus union membership fees if they wish to join one. “What we want are dignified working conditions for the workers on these platforms,” an STPS spokesperson told Rest of World.\n\nThe National Union of App Workers (UNTA) is one of the official unions that collaborated with the STPS on the proposal. Sergio Guerrero, a spokesperson for the UNTA, told Rest of World that the draft law has broad ambitions, but aims specifically for three things: full legal recognition of a working relationship between platforms and workers, full social security provisions to be given by the platforms, and payment according to the number of hours that each worker is logged into the app.\n\n“We have always pushed for a three-way collaboration, promoting conversations between the government, the workers, and the platforms,” Saúl Gómez Piña, a spokesperson for Ni Un Repartidor Menos — a grassroots delivery organization that walked out of the proposal’s drafting process with the unions and the government — told Rest of World. “But right now, the government is just organizing with some unions and plans to force the proposal onto the platforms. It shouldn’t be done like that.”\n\nFor already unprofitable companies like Uber, Didi, and Rappi, becoming full-time employers would go against existing business models built around independent contractors. Rest of World reached out to all three companies, but they declined to comment. According to Guerrero, these platforms are drafting their own counter-proposals to be considered by the Mexican congress when STPS’ proposal is introduced.\n\nProviding legal rights to gig workers poses a larger challenge for both the platforms and the workers — one that the government is fully aware of. “The great debate is who should pay for social security,” Norma Gabriela López Castañeda, incorporation and collection director of the Mexican Social Security Institute, had said in an interview in October 2021.\n\nMore than 70% of the Mexican population is affiliated with some social security program. A portion of the fees they pay to access benefits is paid for by the government, another by the employer, and yet another by the employee. Independent workers, meanwhile, can voluntarily be added to the system, but they must pay more to make up for their lack of an employer.\n\nBut, many gig workers have incentives to stay out of formal employment.\n\n“Plenty of delivery workers are immigrants, working mothers, or elderly. The proposed draft would outright exclude them from working on these platforms.”\n\n“We have plenty of delivery workers that are immigrants, working mothers, or elderly. The proposed draft would outright exclude them from working on these platforms,” Alfredo García Campos, a spokesperson for independent delivery-workers’ organization Unión de Repas, told Rest of World.\n\nJorge García de Presno, a Mexico City-based labor and employment lawyer from international law practice group Cuatrecasas, told Rest of World that there is a significant group of gig workers who are perfectly fine being classified as independent workers because they’re able to manage their own time.\n\nThat is the case of Gabriela Gómez, a single mother who earns part of her income on several delivery platforms and who is also a spokesperson for Unión de Repas. For her, the terms the STPS’ proposal is pushing for would not be of benefit. “Forcing us to work a set amount of hours, as the proposal is attempting, will complicate our lives,” she told Rest of World.\n\nUnión de Repas, which has almost 900 members — most of whom are from Mexico City and the neighboring State of Mexico — is just one of the multitude of organizations that have emerged to protect and vouch for delivery workers’ rights. According to a manifesto published by gig workers’ organizations in late August, there are more than 50 such organizations nationwide. Of those, only two have been recognized as unions by the government. One of them is the UNTA.\n\n“We have 500 affiliated members nationwide, and our goal is to grow large enough to collectively bargain for workers’ rights,” UNTA’s Guerrero told Rest of World. As a state-accredited union, if the draft passes into law, the UNTA would be able to sue the platforms if “there are any injustices in the application of the law,” he claimed, unlike independent groups such as Unión de Repas or Ni Un Repartidor Menos. But, for them, not being able to take platforms to court isn’t an issue.\n\n“Our priority is for workers to keep their working flexibility, meaning they’re able to be online when they want to, for as long as they want to, without working exclusively for one or another platform,” says Gómez Piña, from Ni Un Repartidor Menos.\n\nRather than pushing for social security, as the STPS is, alternative proposals by independent organizations prioritize other challenges faced by gig workers. Ni Un Repartidor Menos is particularly focused on road safety, while Unión de Repas is pushing for a work flexibility and gender-focused strategy to protect female, trans, and disabled workers.\n\n“The representatives of [government-recognized] unions work in an office and not on the streets,” Unión de Repas’ García claimed. “[It] is a sign that they’re just government pawns.” He said his organization would side with the apps if they legally challenged the amendments to the law in their current state. “We would take the streets, if necessary,” he concluded.",
    "The Unexpected Rise in Remittances to Central America and Mexico During the Pandemic": "The Unexpected Rise in Remittances to Central America and Mexico During the Pandemic\n\nRemittances hit record levels in 2021 driven by rising US wages and unemployment insurance relief\n\nRemittances—the money sent from citizens working abroad to families back home—are a crucial source of income in Central America, Panama, and the Dominican Republic (CAPDR) as well as Mexico. Despite an expected decline at the onset of the pandemic, remittances surprisingly increased in 2020, hitting record levels in 2021. IMF staff research explores why remittances from the US to CAPDR and Mexico remained resilient during the pandemic.\n\nAn unexpected comeback\n\nRemittances to CAPDR and Mexico are sent by immigrants working predominantly in the service-providing sectors of the US economy. Economists predicted that remittances to CAPDR and Mexico would decline by up to 20 percent, given the fall in US employment at the onset of the pandemic. They based this prediction on the data from traditional macroeconomic models that linked US labor market conditions with immigrants’ income. These models accurately predicted the deep but brief collapse in remittances that we observed in April 2020, but they failed to predict the strong comeback that followed.\n\nExplaining the surge\n\nBefore the pandemic, the number of remittance transactions—the volume effect—determined the level of remittances. The jump in remittances observed in the second half of 2020 was a result of an increase in both the number of transactions and the average amount remitted per transaction—the value effect.\n\nThe rise in the number of transactions—the volume effect—was most likely driven by an increase in the number of people sending remittances rather than new immigrants arriving in the US. As a result of the lockdowns, immigrants also adapted and switched to remitting digitally, rather than in person, increasing the number of transactions. More importantly, most of the increase in remittances was due to the value effect. Rising US wages drove the increase in the average amounts remitted. US government assistance, through unemployment insurance relief, also supported incomes and compensated for the loss of income, contributing to the increase. The “altruism” motive was very strong; as COVID-19 cases were increasing at home, immigrants in the US sent on average more money home.\n\nRemittances remained strong in 2021 due to the US labor market recovery and sustained growth in real wages. By the end of 2021, the service sectors where CAPDR and Mexican immigrants predominantly work recovered, recording increases in weekly earnings that were above the US average.\n\nA look ahead\n\nLooking forward, the growth in remittances to CAPDR and Mexico is expected to slow, as some of the extraordinary factors in 2020 and 2021 dissipate. However, over time remittances are expected to grow, as immigration to the US continues to rise and the average amount remitted grows in line with US wages. If employment and wages remain strong in the US, we should expect an increase in remittances during times of hardship in Central America and Mexico, as immigrants help families back home.\n\n****\n\nYorbol Yakhshilikov is an economist in the IMF Western Hemisphere Department.",
    "Mexico's 'Chucky' Lozano steps up with late winner vs. Peru to give El Tri pre-World Cup boost": "PASADENA, Calif. -- For a little over 80 minutes on Saturday night against Peru, it looked as if a dark period for Mexico's men's national team would extend one game further as they approach the 2022 FIFA World Cup.\n\nBefore kicking off the weekend's friendly at the Rose Bowl, Mexico had one win in their last five games, which built additional tension for manager Gerardo \"Tata\" Martino and his side after a questionable run through World Cup qualifying and poor friendly results earlier this year.\n\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, MLS, more (U.S.)\n\nDuring a media day on Tuesday, themes of fan discontent, injury problems and leadership issues surrounded the national team. Martino looked frustrated behind the microphone at the media day, admitting that Mexico haven't played their best soccer since 2019-20, while also listing injuries for key players like Wolverhampton Wanderers striker Raul Jimenez, Houston Dynamo DP Hector Herrera, Ajax's Jorge Sanchez and Monterrey duo Rogelio Funes Mori and Luis Romo. Sevilla's Jesus \"Tecatito\" Corona, arguably El Tri's top player, was also unavailable in the international break after suffering a leg injury this summer that will likely keep him out of the World Cup.\n\nOff the field, the Mexican Football Federation (FMF) has dealt with a chaotic time of its own. Coupled with complications in the women's national team and at youth level, FMF president Mikel Arriola announced sweeping changes in July. Gerardo Torrado and Ignacio Hierro were fired from their respective posts as general sporting director and sporting director of national teams. Luis Perez was also let go as the men's U20 coach. Women's senior coach Monica Vergara would eventually lose her position as well.\n\nMartino held on to his post, despite failing to win the latest CONCACAF Nations League, the 2021 Gold Cup and going through four consecutive games without a victory against El Tri's U.S. men's national team rivals. Rumors of his possible exit from the FMF after the World Cup have led to a disharmonious and potentially cataclysmic end to 2022, but back on the field at Pasadena this weekend, a glimmer of hope emerged for all involved.\n\nIn front of a raucous 62,729 at the Rose Bowl on Saturday, El Tri eventually looked enlivened after a dull start to the game through second-half substitutions for Uriel Antuna, Santiago Gimenez, Andres Guardado and Orbelin Pineda. Possibly due to desperation in changing the script that appeared pessimistic once again, there was excellent movement and playmaking in the final third that helped lead to a decisive corner in the 85th minute, which provided star winger Hirving \"Chucky\" Lozano with a goal that sent the Rose Bowl into a frenzy. and secured a 1-0 win.\n\nThe 27-year-old did well to lead attacking efforts, and eventually found the game-winner late into the second half. Lozano was emotional after scoring his first goal in 2022 for Mexico, while fans sang his name to the usual tune of \"Seven Nation Army.\" Chants of \"El Chu-cky Lo-za-no\" were by far the loudest that they've been heard in years, joyous in the trust that the Napoli player had created a necessary step forward in Mexican soccer.\n\nConfidence at an all-game high, it was easy to forget about any of the problems El Tri has had on or off the field. The Rose Bowl became a party, and unlike the dire scenes that have become the norm at many Mexico matches, there was elation in their first of two World Cup \"sendoff\" games this month in California that ended in a 1-0 victory.\n\nHirving 'Chucky' Lozano gave Mexico a much-needed win in one of their final friendly matches before the World Cup. Omar Vega/Getty Images\n\n\"A victory is always important, and even more so against such a difficult team,\" Lozano said to TUDN after scoring the game-winner. \"I think they made the match very tough for us.\"\n\nEven the typically serious and tired Martino was beaming after the game, knowing not just that Mexico had earned a vital result, but that also he could have an unexpected leader through Lozano.\n\n\"After so many years in Europe, obviously, it makes a footballer evolve in every way,\" a proud Martino said about the Napoli winger after the match. \"It's clear that he is evolving, not only in the soccer part, but also in the professional part and in the human part.\"\n\n- 2022 World Cup bracket and fixtures schedule\n\nIt wasn't just about Chucky, but about the entire squad as they celebrated the goal. Through a release of tension, El Tri desperately needed this result ahead of the World Cup and above the criticism that has been placed upon them since struggling to recreate the magic of Martino's first couple of years in 2019 and 2020. In the postmatch news conference, Martino noted that the team is \"much more similar\" to the one that reached a perceived peak a couple years ago.\n\nIt's questionable to buy into the idea that Mexico are truly turning things around after a number of head-scratching performances over the last several months, but if they claimed another victory this Tuesday against Colombia at Santa Clara's Levi's Stadium (which would mark just their second consecutive victory this year), there would be hope that Mexico's final two pre-World Cup friendlies could propel the team towards greater things at Qatar this November.\n\nThe idea of gradual changes and last-minute long shots might be unrealistic for their World Cup chances, but the same could be said of Lozano's lone attempt back in 2018 that shocked Germany in a 1-0 defeat during the World Cup.\n\nRegardless of injury problems across the squad and issues behind the scenes within the front office, Mexico can continue making small steps forward this month, with the help of an unlikely leader in Lozano and with the dreams of bigger and prominent steps this November.",

We come from a variety of different professions. We have biologists, pilots, cinematographers, photographers, ecologists, lawyers and many others,\" explains Porfirio Gomez, director of Orgcas.\n\nThe name, 'Orgcas,' is a play on the words, mixing 'organisation' and 'Orcas', an alternative word to describe a killer whale. Orgcas aim to preserve all species of marine life but are focusing their efforts on protecting sharks.\n\nThe importance of sharks\n\nSharks play an essential role in the ecosystem as they control their prey's distribution, abundance and diversity. They also indirectly support the growth of ocean plants by controlling populations of sea creatures that feed on them.\n\nAccording to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), there are over 500 species of shark worldwide. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species states that over 143 of these species are in serious danger of extinction and are considered vulnerable to critically endangered.\n\nSeventy per cent of the shark population in Baja California is already gone according to Frida Lara, a scientific coordinator at Orgcas Irene Barajas\n\nThere are many reasons for the decline in the number of sharks. Their habitat is under increasing threat from pollution and climate change. Some are caught accidentally. Many are caught deliberately for their fins, which some countries consider a delicacy.\n\n\"Seventy per cent of the shark population in Baja California is already gone. We already have locally extinct sharks such as the Great Hammerhead and the Oceanic White Tip Shark that are almost gone too,\" says Frida Lara, scientific coordinator at Orgcas. \"If we don't do something now, it will be too late for shark populations to recover,\" she adds.\n\nShark fishing is legal in Mexico.\n\nThe method of shark fishing is legal in Mexico, and the country has occupied the top spot in the world in shark catching ever since the 1970s, according to the Intercultural Centre for the Study of Deserts and Oceans.\n\n\"The people that fish for sharks have been doing it for years. Their families have been doing it for generations before them. It is the only line of work they know, and we're not here to judge them,\" Porfirio Gomez tells Scenes.\n\nOrgcas are helping fishing communities transition from catching sharks to becoming tourist hubs for shark-related experiences Irene Barajas\n\nOrgcas are helping fishing communities transition from catching sharks to becoming tourist hubs for shark-related experiences. \"The town we're working with is called Agua Amarga. It is a small fishing town with a population of 500 people,\" says Elena, director of development at Orgcas. \"We are training them so that they can have an extra income and they can eventually phase out shark fishing,\" she adds.\n\nEmbracing change\n\nThere is no doubt that shark fishing is a challenging profession. Travelling to deep water to find sharks can be expensive and dangerous. So many local fishermen are willing to make a change in their careers.\n\nOrgcas's ultimate ambition is to expand its model to cover the whole peninsula of Baja, California, in order to protect its ecosystems at large Irene Barajas\n\n\"There is double the number of fishermen out there now. It is harder to fish because there are too many of us. But if we go with tourism, customers can go out and see one or two sharks, and they will be happy, and the ocean will be healthier,\" says Francisco Lucero Gerardo, a fisherman and member of Orgcas.\n\n\"If we can prove that this model is successful, I think we will start working with other fishing communities. I think Orgcas has huge potential to help people change their lives in many different ways,\" says Frida.\n\nOrgcas have gained the trust of the fishing community in Agua Amarga and are helping to increase local shark populations. As a result, the organisation's ultimate ambition is to expand its model to cover the whole peninsula of Baja, California, in order to protect its ecosystems at large.",

    "Mexico: Will the EV Transition Pull Mexico’s Automotive Industry Out of Industrial ‘Long COVID’?: Parts and components have felt fine all along.": "M\n\nexico has been a growing leader in the automotive manufacturing industry for decades with companies from Japan, the U.S. and Germany frequently seeking out the low-cost yet highly capable workforce. In 2012 the country ranked as the 10th largest automotive producer in the world and in 2021 pushed out South Korea and claimed sixth place. But the Mexican National Institute of Statistics and Geography reported that in 2021 automotive production dropped by 20.25% across the country, and auto exports fell by 16.46%. The institute further reported that GM and Nissan were hit hard, with GM Mexico’s production falling by 43.7% in 2021, and Nissan Mexicana’s tumbling by 27.2%. Production halts occurred at three Nissan plants as raw materials and microchips became inaccessible.\n\nSupply chain disintegration, the semiconductor shortage and halts in production are all effects of an industrial “long COVID.” But even after a dismal 2021, this May Nissan announced plans to invest $700 million over the next three years in its Mexican plants, including its facility in Aguascalientes.\n\n“Mexico plays an important role in Nissan’s global operations, both as one of the main markets for vehicle sales, and as an export hub for dozens of markets around the world,” said Jeremie Papin, chairperson of Nissan Americas. The company still has faith in the region, and will introduce new Nissan electric vehicles such as the Nissan Kicks e-POWER to the Mexican market.\n\nMore Lover Than Competitor\n\nAlthough Mexico is producing fewer and fewer whole automobiles, the country is spectacular at producing automotive parts. “Despite the fact that fewer cars are being produced, in Mexico, we are making more for each car produced in our country,” said Manuel Montoya for Mexico Business News. Montoya is the president of the National Network of Automotive Industry Clusters, a non-profit that aims to promote automotive manufacturing in Mexico. “Thus, 2022 will be a year of growth for the Mexican automotive industry.”\n\nConway Data, the parent company of Site Selection magazine, has logged 90 automotive production facility projects in Mexico since the beginning of 2021, 64% of which are in parts manufacturing. This paints a tempting portrait for the Mexican auto parts industry, which grew by 21% in 2021.\n\nThe whole world seems to agree. Of these 90 projects — which include facility expansions, developments, and headquarters, — 61 are international, with the main players being the United States and Germany, who account for 37% of investment. Manufacturing represents 45% of all Mexican foreign direct investment, with the automotive industry as torch bearer.\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis reports U.S. investment totaled $9.3 billion in Mexico in 2021, with transportation equipment accounting for $981 million of that total. The countries are more co-conspirators than actual competitors, since investment and nearshoring in Mexico has huge benefits for the United States, and Mexico is a consumer of U.S. goods. In 2021 the Census Bureau found that the U.S. imported $385 billion in goods from Mexico, second only to China. The U.S. also exported $276 billion to Mexico, second to Canada, which recently unseated its USMCA trade partner.\n\nElectrifying Mexico\n\nAnalysts for The New York Times predict that by 2035 EVs will make up 25% of all new car sales and account for 60% of new sales by 2050. Demand for EVs is soaring, and buyers often have to put down deposits months ahead of time or risk the model selling out. Automotive companies are likewise putting down deposits on Mexico’s EV future.\n\nIn 2018, Mexican electric car company Zacua started production in Puebla. The company’s two models resemble muscled Mini Coopers with a range of around 100 miles per charge, perfect for urban areas. After a COVID-induced hiatus the company began selling its first cars this year for a little more than US$30,000, though subsidies upwards of $2,000 are offered. The cars are majority Mexican made, but some parts are outsourced to Spanish and French brands. Zacua CEO Nazareth Black wants this to change.\n\n“When we started, we brought in the transmission systems from outside. Now, we make them at the plant,” she said in an interview with Diálogo Chino in June. “We want all the parts to be Mexican. That is what we have been doing over the years: working on supply issues.” Black said it can be difficult to compete with huge brands that have been coming to Mexico, realizing it’s cheap to assemble there. “Everything is more expensive for us than a global brand. If I buy 50 steering wheels, for example, Ford buys 5 million. Who will get it cheaper?”\n\nThe company is small, and vehicles are assembled by hand. Black wants to make the company attractive to foreign investors who want to use Mexico to enter North American markets, “So why don’t we make a platform to serve them? Either we see them as competition, or we collaborate and capitalize on this.”\n\nThe electric engine of Nissan’s Kicks e-POWER.\n\nCourtesy of Nissan\n\nIn 2021 GM announced a $1 billion investment in its Ramos Arizpe plant in Coahuila, Mexico, with the intention of making it the fifth electric-specific GM plant. Initial phases will include the production of battery packs and electric motors alongside gas engines, with the potential of producing full electric vehicles in 2023, including Cadillac crossovers.\n\nThere are further rumors of Tesla considering Mexico as its next production site, possibly to be announced at the end of 2022. This speculation comes as Chinese company Contemporary Amperex Technology is said to be considering two locations in Mexico with investments up to $5 billion, possibly in the states of Chihuahua or Coahuila close to the U.S. border and to Tesla’s Texas factory in metro Austin. The company is the world’s biggest maker of electric batteries for cars and is a main supplier for Tesla.\n\nThe marriage in locations between the supplier and manufacturer would funnel billions in investment to northern Mexico, which already houses 52.1% of the country’s auto parts production. Coahuila, the location of GM’s 40-year-old manufacturing operation, represents 17.2% of auto parts production, Chihuahua 11.9% and Nuevo Leon 11.4%. All three regions are along the Texas border and have an experienced workforce with coveted proximity to the U.S. and Canada.",
    "What Art Lovers Should See in Mexico City, One of the World’s Top Art Destinations": "To say Mexico City is a great place to experience art would be a substantial understatement. Not only has it produced one of the world’s most beloved painters, Frida Kahlo, but it has consistently stood at the forefront of various international art movements for more than a century.\n\nBut the city’s artistic standing — as well as that of Mexico in general — suffers from misapprehensions derived largely from the region’s rather notorious reputation. At best it’s often considered a destination that offers little more than beaches and booze and, at worst, it’s assumed to be too dangerous to visit, great art notwithstanding.\n\nHaving spent most of the the past six years living in Mexico City and the rest of the country, I can report that both assertions are inaccurate. While the country has undoubtedly suffered issues with crime, Mexico is safe for visitors, with Mexico City in particular undergoing rapid shifts in recent decades to become a safer and ever-more artistically vibrant city. The city overflows with an artistic abundance that stacks up against any other great art city of the world. To that end, here’s a selection of the city’s standout art experiences, from its most renowned museums to under-the-radar spots that only locals know to visit.",

    "Should You Attend A Timeshare Presentation On Your Next Trip To Mexico?": "Share The Article\n\nLast Updated 3 hours ago\n\nIf you’ve traveled to Mexico in the last few years, you’ve probably run into someone at the airport or in your hotel offering you a seemingly incredible deal on something if only you agree to sign up for a timeshare presentation. Would you sit through a 90-minute timeshare presentation to save $986 on a 5-night stay at an all-inclusive? How about for a free taxi ride?\n\nThe ‘gifts’ for attending a timeshare presentation can range from a minuscule free taxi ride to a free stay at an all-inclusive. Obviously, one is more appealing than the other! However, unsuspecting travelers may find themselves swept up into a timeshare presentation without ever knowing that’s what they signed up for.\n\nThose in the timeshare industry are incredibly adept at getting people to sign up for presentations, hence why you will see so many right after landing at many major airports in Mexico.\n\nTravel Off Path has put together a guide to considering timeshare presentations in Mexico, with particular emphasis on the Cancun area. Read on for the Who, What, Where, When, and Why of timeshare presentations in Mexico.\n\nWhat Is A Timeshare?\n\nA simple explanation for a timeshare would be a vacation property that is “owned” fractionally by many people. Essentially, you would pay to “own” a property to use for a week or two every year. Often presented as a way to save some money, there may be certain instances where owning a timeshare could be beneficial. However, in most cases, travelers probably wouldn’t be saving enough to make it a 100% beneficial decision for future travel.\n\nMany popular hotel brands have their own versions of timeshares available, such as Disney Vacation Club, Marriott Vacations Worldwide, or Wyndham Destinations.\n\nWhen most people hear the word ‘timeshare,’ they don’t think of the actual property itself. For many, hours-long presentations with high-pressure salespeople come to mind. Indeed, the most common way people come into timeshare ownership is a direct result of attending a timeshare presentation. Many go into the presentation absolutely sure they won’t fall into a timeshare purchase. But, if this were always the case, companies wouldn’t be offering benefits for attending the presentations in the first place.\n\nWhy Should (Or Shouldn’t) You Attend A Timeshare Presentation?\n\nThe biggest reason you may consider attending a timeshare presentation is for the presentation offer. As referenced earlier, timeshare offers can range widely, from small things like a free meal to significant things like free hotel stays. Depending on their impact on your travels, some offers may be worth considering attending a timeshare presentation. Some typical offers for attending a timeshare presentation include:\n\nDiscounted or free hotel stays\n\nMeals or drinks\n\n“No cost” taxi rides\n\nFree tickets to events or parks (like Disney or Universal)\n\nFree spa treatments\n\nThis isn’t an extensive list by any means. Still, these are some of the more common offers for attending a timeshare presentation. Also, notice our use of the word free. This isn’t quite correct, as you will be giving up precious time you could enjoy during your vacation. This is one of the biggest reasons you shouldn’t consider attending a timeshare presentation on your next trip to Mexico.\n\nWho Should Attend? Who Shouldn’t? Who’s Presenting?\n\nWho Should Attend?\n\nTravelers on an extremely tight budget may benefit from attending a timeshare presentation. If money is really tight, some of the offers for attending a timeshare presentation may be beneficial. Suppose you can secure a free stay in a hotel up to your standard. In that case, one of the highest travel costs can be reduced immensely, sometimes completely.\n\nWho Shouldn’t Attend?\n\nSuppose you have the money to go on vacation to an area in Mexico you know you will enjoy without worrying too much about breaking the bank. In that case, a timeshare presentation will just feel like a waste of time for you. Also, if you are a person who can be easily swayed, stay as far away from a timeshare presentation as you can.\n\nThere is a reason the process is so lengthy and tedious. There’s a reason they are giving you free lunch. They want you to feel invested in the experience, and they want you to feel bad about saying no. If you aren’t the type that can stick to your decision in the face of high-pressure sales, do not go to a timeshare presentation.\n\nAn Author’s Anecdote\n\nMy wife and I got married when we were young and penniless. However, I didn’t let that deter us from going on a honeymoon. We saved as much as possible and searched for all sorts of ways to reduce costs. During a wedding show, we found out we could get four nights free at a decent hotel in Orlando as long as we attended a presentation about cookware. Being young a naïve, we happily signed up.\n\nAfter four grueling hours of hearing about how amazing this cookware was, we had to fight to contain our laughter as we said no to the hilariously overpriced $1400 set of pots and pans. We got our free stay in Orlando, and I wasn’t too annoyed about the lost time.\n\nI wish that’s where the story ended.\n\nAfter arriving in Orlando, we found out that we had to attend a timeshare presentation for the hotel stay to be free. Without writing a novel about how much I wish we had just paid for a hotel, I’ll summarize the experience.\n\nWe went to lunch with our timeshare salesperson, their treat, of course.\n\nWatched a 2-hour long video presentation about how fantastic the timeshare was.\n\nToured the timeshares\n\nFinally, we sat down to hear the final pitch (or so we thought). For the small price of $13,000, we could visit our timeshare property in Orlando once a year.\n\nThis was the easiest no thanks we’ve ever uttered. Mainly because we barely had $1,000 to our name. However, we said no an additional six times before we were finally able to leave. With each no, we would hear about some new deal that would lower the price by a few thousand dollars. The final time they asked, they offered that same $13,000 timeshare for $2,400. We said no every time, and with each no, they made us feel worse and worse. They will really try to make you feel bad for saying no.\n\nI wish we hadn’t fallen into not one but two presentation traps. For what we received, it wasn’t worth the time. However, had the final payout been a weeklong stay at an all-inclusive resort? I would probably feel differently, especially because of how little money we had at the time.\n\nNow, however, the presentation offer would have to be mind-blowing to get us to attend another one.\n\nWhen And Where Should You Expect “Timeshare Sharks”?\n\nThe most common place you will see timeshare salespeople will be after landing at the airport in Mexico. Cancun is notorious for this, but many other airports also have them. According to Rene Gaudreau, while taking a video of Cancun airport, “All these people here are trying to sell you timeshares, they’re lined up on both sides… they’re going to try and stop you, they’ll lie to you, they’ll tell you anything, they’re going to tell you they are your transportation company… just ignore them, your transportation company is outside.”\n\nNot Interested?\n\nIf you have zero interest in seeing what timeshare salespeople have to say, just ignore them and head to your transportation outside the airport. As stated in the video, many timeshare reps inside the airport will claim to be your transportation to trick you into attending a timeshare presentation. Don’t fall for it! Your transport will always be outside the airport waiting and will never meet you inside.\n\n#mexicotrip #traveltiktok ♬ Oh No – Kreepa @jennifervalentinephoto Let’s talk about timeshares on your vacation, there is no way to get out of the hotel asking you about this whike on vacation- they will usually give you some type of perk to come to their presentation that they say is an hour long.. Fun fact it usually is way over an hour long intense sales pitch lol ( I know from personal experience when I was a young traveler) – tell them no thank you and enjoy your vacation! Don’t be locked into a rate for the next 30 years 😌 #travelagent\n\nAnother place you could see timeshare salespeople would be right on your resort’s property. It’s not uncommon to get a call from the front desk letting you know you could attend a “breakfast presentation” for a percentage off your stay or other perks. Similarly, watch out for the ‘activities manager’ or the ‘concierge.’ Sometimes these roles are just a timeshare rep in disguise, as Rosamarie T details in a Tripadvisor review. However, this isn’t always the case. If you feel you are being pulled into a timeshare sales attempt and aren’t interested, simply walk away.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nWhether or not you should attend a timeshare presentation on your next trip is ultimately a decision left to you. Hopefully, some of this information can help you decide whether it is in your best interest. However, be extremely careful if you choose to go to a presentation. Timeshares are notoriously difficult to get out of and can be a serious financial commitment. If you can’t trust yourself to say no (assuming you don’t want a timeshare), don’t risk it!\n\nThis article originally appeared on Travel Off Path.

    "This Unknown City In Mexico Is Becoming One Of The Most Popular Destinations In The Country": "Share The Article\n\nLast Updated 4 days ago\n\nIt seems like Mexico has a new star in the making, as an unknown city that had never before been widely promoted as a destination takes center stage as part of the country’s tourism offer. It does not have a shoreline and thus no pristine beaches like those found in the Caribbean, nor the Yucatan Peninsula’s Mayan monuments, but it is rapidly becoming one of the most popular destinations south of the border.\n\nEver since the world’s borders reopened for tourism and normal tourism resumed, Mexico has claimed for itself the coveted title of King of Tourism, and it’s not hard to see why. Being a country rich in nature and home to numerous iconic landmarks, it is a natural leader in vacation bookings, especially when it comes to sunny getaways.\n\nShockingly though, most visitors to Mexico still fail to grasp how actually diverse and multicultural it truly is – or did, up until this year:\n\nThe Secret Is Out: Mexico Is So Much More Than A Sunny Beach Break\n\nTo reduce Mexico to its resort zones and the occasional mystical ancient pyramid is a crude mistake. Yes, these attractions contribute hugely to making the country great, and we definitely cannot underestimate the power of Cancun as a winter hotspot, but at the same time, a majority of Mexico, and arguably where its untarnished beauty is found, has been concealed from the public eye for years.\n\nLuckily, things are changing, and tourists, including American vacationers, have started to venture more inland in search of ‘more Mexico’, as opposed to being isolated in one of the Riviera Maya’s colossal tourist complexes year after year. This trend translates into actual numbers: a growing number of travelers are seeking more unique experiences when visiting Mexico.\n\nAt the forefront of Mexico’s Tourism Renaissance are its colonial towns, many of which are protected by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites. One of those, the unsung Guanajuato, has been smashing arrival figures, not only because it has its own international airport, allowing for easier access, but due to the fact that it’s simply stunning.\n\nAlthough many are not aware of this, Mexico is where some of the oldest European settlements in the Americas are located. Guanajuato is a prime example of that, with narrow, winding streets lined with ocher-colored houses emulating those found in Spain, and Neo-Gothic churches piercing the skyline.\n\nWhat Makes Guanajuato So Damn Special?\n\nBoth in 2021 and 2022, it was named the Best City in the World according to Travel + Leisure, while Mexico itself deemed it the country’s most beautiful this year. Guanajuato is indeed a sight to behold, not to mention bucket list material, but those who might have wished to keep this gem all to themselves a while longer may be disappointed to learn the secret is out.\n\nAccording to Juan Jose Alvarez Brunel, Secretary of Tourism of Guanajuato, by the end of 2022, the city is expected to recover roughly 70 percent of its tourists, a much higher rate than entire countries – we see you Australia and Canada – and a surprising figure for a non-coastal city that, for the most part, hasn’t been a priority for Mexican Tourism.\n\nThe data has been provided by different service providers, including those in the private sector, academics, and even the World Tourism Organization. As Brunel puts it, should Guanajuato keep up the pace, by late 2023, it should be back to where it was in 2019 and even ‘begin to grow again’. Doesn’t sound too impressive?\n\nWell, that is perhaps because the vast majority of Americans visiting Mexico flock to Cancun, and Cancun only. Of course, when it comes purely to arrivals and gross revenue, there is no beating the Caribbean jewel, but we must understand that, due to being so popular, there is over-representation when it comes to tourism trends and the Riviera Maya.\n\nIn A World Where Giants Like Cancun Exist, Guanajuato’s Recovery Rate Is Nothing Short Of Stellar\n\nA large sum of Mexico’s hard-earned tourist dollars are spent in Cancun, Tulum, and other neighboring municipalities, and naturally, those will bounce back much faster, or even entirely eclipse, other minor destinations in the country. The fact that Guanajuato is repositioning itself as a much stronger competitor this year and still getting its share when so much of Mexican travel revolves around the Caribbean cities is nothing short of stellar.\n\nThis success story is largely attributed to the regional tourism authorities, who boldly envisioned Guanajuato as Mexico’s cultural, enotourism, and gastronomy capital. Regarding the latter, they surely have enough reasons to brag, seeing that UNESCO itself granted Guanajuato’s food scene an ‘Intangible Gastronomy World Heritage’ status in 2020.\n\nCurrently, the motto is the following:\n\nGuanajuato is where visitors can live great stories\n\nYou may be wondering why, considering Guanajuato may not have been a priority on your planned itinerary for Mexico until you came across this article. Allow us to explain why according to the Secretary’s own assertions:\n\nIt is truly one of Mexico’s top enotourism destinations, being the fourth largest producer with 43 vineyards *\n\n* Its Old Town, dating back to the 16th century, has been deemed by UNESCO a true architectural wonder\n\nGuanajuato is within short driving distance of numerous other colonial hotspots of Mexico, including the charming San Miguel de Allende\n\nof numerous other colonial hotspots of Mexico, including the charming San Miguel de Allende The International Airport of Guanajuato offers direct flights from several U.S. cities, including Chicago, both from Midway and O’Hare, Houston, Dallas, and Los Angeles\n\n*21 of those vineyards welcome tourists/guided tours\n\nOther Perks Of Making Guanajuato Your Next Winter Vacay\n\nOnce landing in Guanajuato, tourists have facilitated access to 46 municipalities across the state, including its eponymous capital, by means of a ‘comprehensive road system’ cutting across the territory and reaching deep into Mexico’s more quaint, authentic countryside. Other highlights mentioned include:\n\nVarious hotel chains as well as independent accommodation providers\n\nA myriad of hot springs, spas, and wellness centers that will give the Mayan Worlds a run for their money\n\nthat will give the Mayan Worlds a run for their money World-renowned restaurants (Guanajuato’s cuisine has been noted by UNESCO, remember?)\n\n20 percent of Guanajuato State is a ‘natural protected area’ , home to 45 percent of all bird species in the country – any nature lovers here?\n\n, home to 45 percent of all bird species in the country – any nature lovers here? Great infrastructure, something we already discussed briefly writing on San Miguel de Allende\n\nAs Mr. Brunel brilliantly puts it, Guanajuato has no beaches, but it does not need them: its man-made colonial wonders and foodie scene are exactly what sets it apart from coastal Mexico and precisely the reason why it’s experiencing a revival lately.\n\nRead More:\n\nTravel Insurance That Covers Covid-19 For 2022\n\nMexico Enters Hurricane Season This Month – Here’s What To Expect If You’re Visiting\n\n7 Tips To Travel Stress Free During Your Fall Trip To Mexico\n\nMexico Has Already Welcomed 36 Million International Tourists This Year\n\nResearch Shows Los Cabos Is One Of The Safest Destinations In Mexico\n\nThis article originally appeared on Travel Off Path.

    "Mexico should overturn mandatory pre-trial detention: UN experts": "GENEVA (5 September 2022) - The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention urgently calls on Mexico to abolish mandatory pre-trial detention, also known as “automatic preventive detention”, enshrined in the Constitution.\n\n“Mandatory pre-trial detention is contrary to international guarantees for human rights protection, as the jurisprudence of the Working Group has indicated on multiple occasions,’’ said Miriam Estrada-Castillo, the Working Group’s chair-rapporteur. The Inter-American Court and Commission on Human Rights, as well as the Human Rights Committee and the Committee against Torture, have adopted similar conclusions, the expert said.\n\nUnder article 19 of the Constitution, the Mexican legal system obliges judges to impose pre-trial detention on all persons accused of specific crimes, which has led to multiple violations of their fundamental human rights, such as the presumption of innocence, due process and equality before the law.\n\nMandatory pre-trial detention is also contrary to judicial independence and to the duty to legally motivate the reasons for the detention, Estrada-Castillo said. In addition, it seriously jeopardises the right to personal integrity and to not be at risk of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. Even if pre-trial automatic detention is established by law, this is not a guarantee that it is not arbitrary.\n\n“One of the most serious consequences of mandatory pre-trial detention has been that many Mexicans spend more than a decade deprived of their liberty, awaiting trial, without sentence and in conditions of serious risk to their lives and personal integrity. It also contributes to prison overcrowding,” Estrada-Castillo said.\n\nConscious of the public security challenges that the Government is facing, the Working Group reiterated that mandatory pre-trial detention places Mexico in violation of its international obligations undertaken with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\nOverturning automatic pre-trial detention not only is a key step to addressing the problem of arbitrary deprivation of liberty in Mexico, it will also help to reduce overpopulation in the penitentiary system.\n\nThe Working Group, since 2018, through its opinions and communications, has insisted to Mexico that it must urgently resolve this structural problem, repeatedly offering the necessary technical assistance to the Government.\n\nCurrently, Mexico has a historic opportunity to overturn a harmful measure that has hindered the fundamental rights of thousands of Mexicans for years.\n\nENDS\n\nThe Working Group on Arbitrary Detention was established by the former Commission on Human Rights in 1991 to investigate instances of alleged arbitrary deprivation of liberty. Its mandate was clarified and extended by the Commission to cover the issue of administrative custody of asylum-seekers and immigrants. In September 2019, the Human Rights Council confirmed the scope of the Working Group's mandate and extended it for a further three-year period. The Working Group is comprised of five independent expert members from various regions of the world: Ms. Miriam Estrada-Castillo (Ecuador; Chair-Rapporteur), Mr. Mumba Malila (Zambia; Vice-Chair); Ms. Elina Steinerte (Latvia); Ms. Priya Gopalan (Malaysia); and Mr. Matthew Gilllett (New Zealand).\n\nDatabase of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention.\n\nThe Working Group is part of what is known as the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council. Special Procedures, the largest body of independent experts in the UN Human Rights system, is the general name of the Council’s independent fact-finding and monitoring mechanisms that address either specific country situations or thematic issues in all parts of the world. Special Procedures’ experts work on a voluntary basis; they are not UN staff and do not receive a salary for their work. They are independent from any government or organization and serve in their individual capacity.",

REUTERS/Raquel Cunha\n\nMEXICO CITY, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum, a trained physicist vying to become the country's first female president, is hoping her environmental credentials and success in curbing crime will help set her apart in the race for the top job in 2024.\n\nSheinbaum, a loyal ally of leftist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has held a slight lead over rivals in recent opinion polls as she gears up to compete for the presidential candidacy of the ruling National Regeneration Movement (MORENA).\n\nA strong supporter of social welfare programs promoted by the president that have helped forge his power base and tackle inequality across the country, Sheinbaum, 60, is viewed by many inside the party as his obvious ideological successor.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\n\"I've been there (with Lopez Obrador) in the good times and the bad,\" she said in an interview with Reuters in the palatial city hall, pointing to a shared past with the president going back to her stint as the capital's environment minister when he was mayor from 2000 to 2005.\n\n\"The president's projects must be consolidated, I share the president's vision of a Mexico with justice, and a Mexico where the welfare state must play a fundamental part in development.\"\n\nThe country will elect its next president in June 2024, and Sheinbaum and other potential prospects including Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard have begun jostling for the MORENA candidacy, which is expected to be settled by late 2023.\n\nLopez Obrador, who is barred by law from standing for a second term, has dominated national politics since taking office in 2018, and MORENA remains far more popular than the main opposition parties.\n\nWere she to succeed him, Sheinbaum, whose measured scientific reserve contrasts with Lopez Obrador's combative approach to politics, said she was acutely aware of how symbolic the achievement would be for girls and women in Mexico and beyond.\n\n\"For me to be able to represent that, just imagine the honor and responsibility it means,\" she said, hailing the example of Katya Echazarreta, who in June became the first Mexican-born woman to travel to space.\n\nGREEN ENERGY\n\nLopez Obrador's drive to strengthen the state oil and gas company and the national power utility - both of which depend heavily on fossil fuels - at the expense of private wind and solar power firms has caused friction with the United States and other longstanding allies.\n\nThe policy has also upset some on the Mexican left eager to see the country give priority to renewable energy sources.\n\nSheinbaum, who was part of an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change which shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, has defended Lopez Obrador's efforts to pursue energy independence, but also wants to capitalize on Mexico's green energy reserves.\n\n\"I think it's crucial to really take advantage of renewable energies in the country,\" she said when asked how a Sheinbaum administration could differ from its predecessor, even as she stressed her support for Lopez Obrador's vision for Mexico.\n\nSome have also pressed for higher taxation. Asked whether she favored higher taxes, Sheinbaum declined to be drawn, saying the question would need careful analysis.\n\nWhere Mexico City has diverged is in its success in reducing gang-fuelled violence that has for years ravaged the country.\n\nThe city has targeted problem areas, increasing the number of police on the streets and their pay, Sheinbaum said, and more than quadrupling the number of video surveillance cameras.\n\nWhile the national murder tally barely dropped at all in 2021 from nearly 34,000 in 2018, Mexico City's total fell by well over a third during the same period.\n\nThis year the nationwide figure has eased somewhat.

    "As numbers rise, the hardships of migration through Mexico multiply": "TAPACHULA, Mexico\n\nTapachula, a town on the Mexico-Guatemala border known for its stifling heat, has earned the nickname of a “migrant prison”. Thousands of people hoping to reach the United States have found themselves detained or stuck here, waiting months to obtain a humanitarian visa and struggling to survive in the city long enough to acquire one.\n\nMigrants and asylum seekers who attempt to leave the city and go north on a bus will swiftly encounter a checkpoint where all on board must present their documents to a Mexican immigration officer.\n\nThose unable to obtain a humanitarian visa often end up at the region's largest detention centre, Siglo XXI, a hellish facility where migrants report not receiving food and having their belongings – including their documents – taken by officials.\n\nIn early August, a Haitian died in captivity. Soon after, 126 Venezuelans held at the prison were deported back to their country.\n\nSiglo XXI detention centre has held up to 1,200 migrants at any one time this year (at least 300 above capacity), many awaiting deportation.\n\nMexico has long been a tricky way station for migrants to navigate en route to the United States, but the tough conditions are likely to become worse: Under President Joe Biden, the United States has been quietly pressing Mexico to accept more migrants from Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, according to a Reuters report. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken raised concerns about the escalation in crossings from the three countries when he visited Mexico City last week, two US and two Mexican officials told Reuters. Mexico did not commit to specific actions.\n\nStill, many migrants and asylum seekers find themselves trapped in an administrative maze, suffering corrupt and sometimes abusive officials as they travel through dangerous regions, caught up in flares of violence from organised crime groups, or exploited by coyotes or polleros.\n\nThe sheer numbers trying to make the journey have also compounded problems in border towns. Between October 2021 and September 2022, US Customs and Border Patrol apprehended a record 2 million migrants, a 20 percent increase from the same period a year ago. Some 40 percent of the migrants and asylum seekers are from nations outside Mexico and Central America, according to the UN’s emergency aid coordination body, OCHA.\n\n“It’s so much worse than the situation we left. We need to get out of here.”\n\nMany who aren’t arrested find their situations equally grim. Grace, a Venezuelan who didn’t want to share her last name because her family still didn’t know she had left the country in the hope of reaching the United States, came to the Jesús el Buen Pastor migrant shelter with her five-year-old daughter in June. The shelter is a non-profit organisation, run by a local woman.\n\nGrace said she had never lived in such squalid conditions: people sleeping outdoors for lack of beds, bowls of beans for dinner, and overflowing bathrooms. The shelter has held some 1,000 to 1,400 people at any time, as opposed to a mere 500 in previous years.\n\n“It’s so much worse than the situation we left,” she told The New Humanitarian. “We need to get out of here.”\n\nInflux of Cubans, Venezuelans, and Haitians\n\nThe Mexican government’s policy of restricting tens of thousands of migrants and asylum seekers to one city has caused such shelters to become desperate, unable to feed everyone off donations.\n\nThe majority currently staying at the Buen Pastor shelter are Venezuelan, following a wave of Cuban migrants and asylum seekers, and before that, Haitians. Government data confirm increases in Cubans, Venezuelans, and Haitians this year, while violence and hunger in Central America has maintained a steady stream of people from that region too.\n\nAccording to COMAR, the Mexican government’s asylum department, 67,000 people applied for refugee status between January and July this year. That is over four times the 16,000 people who applied during the same period last year, when Mexico registered the third highest number of asylum applicants globally. Nearly all of them passed through Tapachula.\n\n“The Haitians face language barriers and a new kind of racism that groups of migrants in the past have not had to contend with.”\n\nAmérico Daniel, another Venezuelan, said he would rather sleep out on the street than in an overcrowded shelter. For the past several months, migrants and asylum seekers have slept in the Parque Bicentenário and other central plazas in Tapachula.\n\n“Of the seven countries I’ve travelled through, Mexico has been the worst in its treatment of migrants coming through. It’s chaos here,” he said.\n\nDaniel arrived in Tapachula as part of a so-called “migrant caravan”, which transit through the region in greater numbers for security. His included citizens of over a dozen countries, from as far away as Bangladesh, but most people were from Latin America and the Caribbean. Most of the Venezuelans and Haitians had crossed, roughly two weeks earlier, the Darién Gap, a dangerous strip of jungle with no roads bridging Colombia and Panama. It often takes migrants a week or more to traverse the area, leaving them vulnerable to dehydration, robberies, and deadly accidents.\n\nRead more → A Cuban asylum seeker’s dangerous odyssey\n\nThe different nationalities within this wave of migrants present distinct vulnerabilities while travelling through Mexico, said Enrique Vidal, head of coordination at the Centre for Human Rights Fray Matías de Córdova, an organisation that provides migrants and asylum seekers with access to resources such as legal assistance and investigates claims of abuse.\n\n“The Haitians face language barriers and a new kind of racism that groups of migrants in the past have not had to contend with,” Vidal said. “Meanwhile, the Cubans face higher fees and prices for everything. They are expected to pay five to ten times more, or to pay in dollars, and the Venezuelans are now hit with a lot of fake news targeting them.”\n\nA recent news report blames Meta, the company behind Facebook and messaging app WhatsApp, for enabling human smuggling by not removing dangerous, misleading information posted by smugglers on the platforms. Meta says it prohibits content that could encourage smuggling.\n\nIn June, the Fray Matías centre released a statement arguing that care for refugees and migrants is abysmal in Mexico, and “could not be more irresponsible”.\n\nEarlier this year, the Mexican Supreme Court announced that the practice of carrying out document checkpoints on highways was unconstitutional and racist.\n\nBut little has changed. Neither the National Migration Institute (INM), nor Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, have responded to the ruling.\n\nThe winding, dangerous path out\n\nNorth of Tapachula, in the town of Huixtla, Mexico’s largest checkpoint operates more like a full-scale bus depot than a roadblock. It was built in 2014 with financial assistance from the United States.\n\nThose who make it through the many checkpoints that line the country all the way through to Mexico’s northern border with the United States still risk cartel violence and kidnappings for ransom as well as abuse at the hands of both US and Mexican authorities. In August, an average of roughly 6,800 migrants were apprehended at the US border every day – that daily number peaked in April, at approximately 8,000.\n\nmap_mexico2.jpg Lillian Perlmutter/TNH Migrants in Tapachula study a map provided by Mexican authorities of transit routes through the country.\n\nAccording to Vidal, the US government may urge Mexico to detain and deport a larger number of people travelling north since the recent overturning of the Remain in Mexico policy, which could allow thousands of Central Americans – many of whom have been waiting for months at the US border for their asylum claims to progress – to begin crossing more freely.\n\n“After the Mérida Initiative from 2006, which was a military agreement between the two countries, the United States government has a hand in keeping migration detention centres active in Mexico,” Vidal explained.\n\nPaperwork backlogs cause more of a bottleneck\n\nMigrants stuck in Tapachula must first go to the office of COMAR and acquire a certification of refugee status. Then they can make an appointment with the INM, the Mexican migration authority, to apply for a humanitarian visa – a small card allowing migrants to travel freely in Mexico for a year.\n\nA steep backlog is just one hurdle. As thousands wait, an estimated 300-400 more people cross from Guatemala to Tapachula every day. That means the current process to acquire the visa can take up to six months, according to migrants and aid workers.\n\nThe appointment sign-up section of the INM website was down for months earlier this year. In recent weeks, appointments for refugee certification at COMAR were rescheduled without properly notifying migrants, which led to anger and confusion.\n\nCOMAR did not respond to questions about migrants’ allegations of disorganisation, cancellations, and rescheduling of appointments.\n\nMost migrants do not have enough money to live in Tapachula for six months, especially without stable, lucrative work. Many landlords will not rent to migrants.\n\nThe long waits have led to protests in front of the INM office in Tapachula, including one in which migrants sewed their lips shut to represent their predicament. In February, a protest became violent after an INM officer deliberately threw a migrant’s papers into the dust.\n\nMigrants and asylum seekers told The New Humanitarian the only way to avoid six months in Tapachula is to join a caravan. This summer saw the largest caravan ever in Mexico, with roughly 10,000 people leaving Tapachula on 3 June.\n\nMost of this year’s caravans were organised by Luís Villagrán, a migrant advocate and director of the Centro de Dignificación Humana. Villagrán holds caravan meetings before departures are scheduled and passes around a list for migrants to add their names and ID numbers to. He hand-delivers this list to the INM office in Tapachula several days before departure.\n\nIn an attempt to break up caravans before they leave the city, INM will regularly send those on Villagrán’s list to a different Mexican city right away to acquire the humanitarian visa at the INM office there, where wait times are lower. “This is usually the best-case scenario,” Villagrán said.\n\nViolence, corruption, and fake news\n\nThe caravans that don’t get broken up by INM can still face violent altercations with National Guard troops.\n\nIn April, Villagrán defied authorities by leading a caravan of several thousand people out of Tapachula without visas before being intercepted by National Guard officers some 18 kilometres outside the city. “They started beating me with a baton,” Villagrán said. “Some of the migrants fought back using the wooden cross that we carried with us, and the troops responded by beating them up even worse.”\n\nSo far this year, INM has arrested nearly double the number of migrants compared to 2021. Sometimes, it is unknown why INM arrests certain migrants and holds them for deportation. According to Villagrán, the night before the caravan was set to leave on 3 June, INM raided a motel where caravan participants were staying and arrested 50 people seemingly arbitrarily.\n\n“We are investigating several cases of torture, sexual, and physical abuse by INM officers in the Siglo XXI detention centre this year,” Vidal said. “And those are just the people who have come forward, which is likely much smaller than the total.”\n\n“The policy of making everyone wait in the Tapachula to process documents makes everything so much more complicated than it needs to be.”\n\nPierre-Marc René, a press representative at the UN’s refugee agency, UNHCR, said there have been a few positive changes. “For example, after pressure from many groups, they are no longer detaining children in Tapachula,” René told The New Humanitarian. “But the policy of making everyone wait in the Tapachula to process documents makes everything so much more complicated than it needs to be.”\n\nIn mid-June, a group of primarily Venezuelans, humanitarian visas in hand, boarded a bus in the northern Mexican state of Coahuila headed for the city of Acuña, a popular crossing point into Texas. National Guard troops stopped the bus and ordered everyone on board to get off and go south to Monterrey or face violent consequences. One young man was then led off the bus, handcuffed, and beaten in front of the rest of the passengers.\n\nThat day, an INM official in Coahuila falsely claimed during a press conference that the humanitarian visa does not give a migrant licence to enter Mexico’s northern border states.\n\n“INM is spreading a lot of disinformation to the Venezuelan community right now, telling them about opportunities [for priority processing] that don’t exist, and setting them up to get into situations where they will be detained,” Vidal said. “There’s a permanent level of corruption within INM that has worsened during the pandemic. If a migrant wants to get their papers smoothly, they would pay a corruption fee.”\n\nINM did not respond to multiple interview requests for this story.\n\nBarriers to access\n\nBoth Vidal and Villagrán said changes in practice and policy by authorities since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic have hindered the work of humanitarian aid organisations trying to help the millions passing through Central and Latin America.\n\n“Using the pandemic as a pretext, they took away our private access to people in the detention centre. Now, if we’re having conversations with anyone, there is always an INM officer in the room, so the migrants never feel comfortable speaking freely anymore,” Vidal said. “We used to accompany migrants from the Guatemalan border to Tapachula, to make sure they arrived safely. Now, INM won’t let us – they call it human trafficking,” he added.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross is still allowed private interviews with migrants in detention, a privilege no longer extended to Vidal and his colleagues at the Fray Matías centre in Cordova.\n\n“This is not going to get better even if the number of migrants lowers in the next few months,” Vidal said. “And we know that is not going to happen anyway, because looking at Cuba right now, and the number of people moving through Panama as we speak, the numbers are only going to increase.”\n\nEdited by Paula Dupraz-Dobias and P.J.

    "Avelo Eyes International Expansion With Mexico, Canada, & Caribbean On The Cards": "Avelo Airlines has been rapidly building its presence in the US domestic market. Its network of more than 30 destinations on both the east and west coasts, often flying into underserved airports, has seen it expand its footprint massively over the past year and a half.\n\nWhile the airline has certainly not exhausted all its options when it comes to domestic connections, flying internationally could well be in its future. Speaking exclusively to Simple Flying, President and CEO of Avelo, Andrew Levy, said that it’s not a question of if, but when. He said,\n\n“We were not actively looking at that, but we absolutely will fly International, it's just a question of when, not if. We are a flag carrier, which means we have all the designations that you need to be able to serve international points on scheduled service. We have lots and lots of experience among our team in terms of international operations. So I do expect that that will come.”\n\nWhere would Avelo fly?\n\nFor Avelo Airlines, any international would need to be a modular progression from its existing hubs and network. It would also need to retain its out-and-back mentality; as yet, Avelo doesn’t fly any route that would leave the plane and crew requiring an overnight stop.\n\nRight now, the airline has a strong presence in the Florida region, with hubs at both Orlando and at Fort Myers. Both of these could open opportunities to the south.\n\nIn the north of the east coast, its original east coast hub airport at Tweed New Haven is far enough north that Canada is entirely doable, without spoiling its out and back in a day strategy. Ottawa, Montreal, Toronto, Hamilton, are all well within the reach of Avelo.\n\nOn the other side of the country, its hub at Hollywood Burbank opens opportunities in both directions. Mexico is just to the south, while to the north, the airline already flies to Pasco Tri-Cities Airport, just a hop and a skip from Vancouver.\n\nLevy agreed with our assessment of its opportunities, stating that,\n\n“For us, international would be … close in, more of a leisure or VFR type focus, which is going to be mostly probably Mexico, Caribbean, those types of things. Certainly, there could be some possibilities in Canada perhaps.”\n\nLong-haul, low-cost doesn’t work\n\nAlthough Avelo could eye some near international destinations to the north and south of the USA, Levy was clear that he has no aspirations to start flying further afield. He said,\n\n“I don't foresee ever deciding to go get really big airplanes that fly across the pond or anything like that. I don't believe in long-haul low-cost - That's not for me. I've never seen it work and someone else will have to prove that one out, one day, maybe…”\n\nPlenty of airlines have had a crack at long-haul, low-cost operations, and plenty have fallen as a result. Those who survive in the longer haul market are either less low-cost than the ULCC that Avelo is – think JetBlue – or they’re flying true LCC services but with long-range narrowbodies – think Wizz Air and some of its A321LR routes.\n\nIt’s always been a tough nut to crack, and for Levy, it’s just a step too far. Nevertheless, we could see some interesting destinations added to the route map in the future that make sense for Avelo to serve.\n\nYou can watch the complete interview with Andrew on the video link below:\n\nWhere would you like to see Avelo landing north or south of the US border?

However, it did interest me. They were not chosen because they play similar to Mexico, they are different,” said the Argentine tactician after the match.\n\nScaloni’s message to the Mexico national team\n\nArgentina and Mexico will meet at the World Cup on 26 November and the Argentine coach sent a message full of praise for Mexico.\n\n“Mexico are a great team. I have no doubt that they are one of the best in the World Cup and that they will make things difficult for us. They have a very marked style of play with their coach, a very offensive style. I think Tata [Gerardo Martino] has done a good job and they will be a tough opponent.”\n\nArgentina facing Mexico in Group C\n\nArgentina have been drawn in Group C of the 2022 World Cup alongside Saudi Arabia, Mexico, and Poland and Scaloni will experience the tournament from the bench for the first time.\n\n“The national team gives you something, responsibility, but you have to enjoy it.

    "Lady Pirates drop match against Mexico, 7-2 – Boonville Daily News": "The Boonville Lady Pirates tennis team fell to 2-7 on the season by losing to the Mexico Lady Bulldogs 7-2 Thursday night at the high school tennis courts.\n\nWhile the Lady Pirates picked up wins at No. 1 singles and No. 1 doubles against Mexico, head coach Melissa Harvey said the girls knew going into the match that Mexico would be a tough team to beat. “They have grown greatly as a team this season and the girls were prepared for tougher matches,” Harvey said. “Ever after all the tough losses this season, the girls continue to put forth their best effort and continue to show up every time with a positive attitude. For our senior night Monday, we’re looking forward to celebrating Emma (Neidig) and all her accomplishments the past four years.”\n\nAs for the two wins on the night, senior Emma Neidig improved to 16-2 on the season at No. 1 singles by beating Mexico’s Katherine Gooch 8-1. Meanwhile, at No. 1 doubles, the team of Neidig and Emily Baker won 8-5 over Katherine Gooch and Jyllian Whitworth to raise their season record to 9-3.\n\nHarvey said Neidig had solid playing time in the match against Lopez. “She had powerful serves and great ball placement,” Harvey said. “The opposing coach even commented that she looked like she was “in her prime” tonight. Emma has grown throughout the season. Hopefully, this momentum continues as districts are right around the corner.”\n\nIn other singles matches, Baker fell to Estrella Ramirez-Lopez 8-0 at the No. 2 position. At No. 3 singles, Georgia Hendrix lost to Jocelyn Jarquin-Garcia 8-1. At No. 4 singles, Paola Sanchez lost to Jyllian Whitworth 8-2. At No. 5 singles, Kaylee Casey lost to Lani Blair 8-0. Meanwhile, at No. 6 singles, Camrynn Hundley lost to Messiah Simpson 8-1.\n\nHarvey said despite Baker’s loss, the junior netter had fabulous movement. “Emily kept her feet going and was able to push the ball back,” Harvey said. “Unfortunately, she was unable to keep up with her opponent. During rallies after several hits, she would start to fall back into old habits and drop.”\n\nAs for Kendrix’s match, Harvey said Georgia was very tense. She said Hendrix was able to push the ball back but didn’t have the best form. “She needs to work on loosening her grip and having more fluid movement,” Harvey said. “She is one of the most positive players on the team and looks forward to learning and growing as a player.”\n\nHarvey also sees growth in Sanchez at the No. 3 singles position. She said Sanchez had long rallies with her opponent but struggled with her backhand. “Paola needs to work on getting her body turned so she is able to get her racket pulled back more,” Harvey said.\n\nAs for Casey, Harvey said Kaylee is still pushing through an injury that is affecting her movement on the court. “She struggled tonight with reaching instead of getting her feet to the ball,” Harvey said. “She is still making adjustments to her serve to be more consistent.”\n\nHarvey also complimented the play of Hundley, who came off the courts with a more positive attitude than in previous matches. She said Camrynn was able to pinpoint what she needs to work on. “We can make adjustments in practice,” Harvey said. “With her drive she is going to advance greatly as a player.”\n\nAs for the remaining two doubles matches for Boonville, the No. 2 team of Hendrix and Sanchez fell to Ramirez-Lopez and Jarquin-Garcia 8-2. Meanwhile, at No. 3 doubles, the team of Casey and Hundley lost to the team of Blair and Hudson 8-0.",
    "This smartphone manufacturer beat Samsung and Apple in Mexico": "On average, Samsung is the world’s largest smartphone manufacturer. However, it doesn’t lead all its rivals in every market and performs better in some regions than others. In some markets, Samsung is the leading brand by a wide margin. While in others, such as Mexico, the company is trying to maintain its spot on the podium.\n\nMexico has an active smartphone user base of around 127 million, and needless to say, there are benefits to leading the mobile game in the country. But it’s neither Samsung nor its biggest rival, Apple, at the top of the food chain in Mexico. According to a recent report, Motorola was the leading OEM in Mexico in Q2 2022, with a smartphone sales share of 28%. (via Telecompaper)\n\nMotorola keeps a tight grip over the Mexican smartphone market\n\nAlthough Motorola led the country’s smartphone scene, Samsung was, thankfully, the second-largest OEM in Mexico during the three-month period ending in June. The company captured 26% of smartphone sales throughout the quarter.\n\nApple followed Samsung in third place. The Cupertino giant rose 3% to capture 16% of the market. Motorola’s share in Q2 2022 increased by 5%, while Samsung’s share remained flat from last year. Other notable smartphone brands were Xiaomi, Oppo, and Huawei. Xiaomi held 13% of the market, while Oppo and Huawei captured 11% and 5%, respectively.\n\nIn other news, Samsung’s chief recently visited Mexico to meet with President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, but this had little to do with the company’s performance in the smartphone segment in Q2. Instead, Samsung’s Lee Jae-yong has requested support from the Mexican President for Busan World Expo 2030.",

    "What Do Foreign Investors Need To Understand About Baja California Sur, Mexico?": "A surfer gets out of the sea at the \"Love Beach\" in Los Cabos, Baja California Sur state, Mexico on ... [+] March 10, 2018. Despite a surge of violent crimes in popular tourist areas such as Los Cabos and Cancun, tourism is Mexico's third largest source of foreign exchange. In 2017 the country hit a new record — 39.3 million tourists who generated $21 billion in business. / AFP PHOTO / DANIEL SLIM (Photo credit should read DANIEL SLIM/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe state of Baja California Sur has a less problematic political risk profile than many other areas of Mexico. The risk of organized crime-related violence (public shootouts, kidnapping of executives) in Baja California Sur is quite low. Poverty and marginalization are less extreme in Baja California Sur than in other parts of Mexico. The risk of serious social unrest in a Baja California Sur is relatively low. Expropriation risk is very low in a Baja California Sur (and in other parts of Mexico.) In general, foreign-owned businesses in Baja California Sur are able to resolve potential corruption issues through government relations, liaising with business chambers, and working with lobbying firms. Overall, Mexico’s political and economic framework is relatively stable and unlikely to suffer from major disruptions in the short or medium term. The political leadership in the tourism hub of Los Cabos, the state government in Baja California Sur, and the federal government Mexico City are all members of the same party (Morena). The current dynamic is likely to hold stable for the next two years. Although economic indicators and security dynamics may both worsen slightly, overall Mexico looks like it is on track to maintain stability in the medium term.\n\nBaja California Sur’s governor, Victor Manuel Castro Cosio, was elected in 2021. He will serve through 2027. Castro Cosio is a member of the Morena party of Mexico’s President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. Prior to joining Morena he was a member of Lopez Obrador’s old party, the PRD. Cosio is backed by a well-established political group including former members of the PRI party. One of the local power-brokers who supports him is Homero Davis Castro, who currently serves as the Secretary General in the Baja California Sur state government.\n\nLos Cabos Mayor Oscar Leggs Castro was elected in 2021. He will serve through 2024. He is eligible to stand for re-election for another term. Leggs Castro is a member of the Morena party, the same party as Baja California Sur’s governor and Mexico’s president. The mayor in Los Cabos is from a different faction of Morena than the governor in Baja California Sur but the two enjoy a positive working relationship.\n\nIt is possible that in 2024 after local and national elections that Los Cabos mayor could represent a different political party than Mexico’s president. Given Los Cabos strategic importance to Mexico’s tourism sector the downside risk of a destructive rift emerging between the mayor and the state and national government is relatively minimal. The most likely scenario is that all three levels of government in Los Cabos will continue to be controlled by the Morena party after the upcoming election cycle. Overall, the political risk outlook in Baja California Sur is relatively stable.\n\nForeign executives doing due diligence on potential investments in Mexico need to understand the potential implications stemming from crime and security issues. In general, the risk of violent crime is lower in Baja California Sur than in other states in Mexico. It is not common for criminal groups in Baja California Sur to kidnap foreign executives or the employees of foreign companies. In 2021, Baja California recorded 77 murders, or 2.4% as many as the neighboring state of Baja California, which recorded 3,246 homicides in 2021. Overall, Baja California Sur recorded the 2nd fewest total number of murders of any state in Mexico. In 2017 three tourists were killed in a shooting at a beach in Los Cabos. Although Baja California Sur is relatively peaceful in 2022 there is no guarantee that the current dynamic will hold in coming years. In general, in Mexico violent crime depends on backroom deals and rifts between rival criminal organizations and political leaders. It is likely that current trends of violence in Baja California Sur and Los Cabos will remain steady over the next two years. However, the arrest or death of senior New Generation members in the state could provoke a new fight for control and cause a major uptick in violent crime. The default outcome for Baja California Sur and Los Cabos will be the continuation of current dynamics over the next two years.\n\nEven though the homicide rate in Baja California Sur is lower than Mexico’s national average, common crime is still a potential risk in the state. In 2021, Baja California Sur recorded 397 incidents of cars being stolen but only five cases of violent carjacking. Baja California Sur did not record any express kidnappings or any kidnappings for ransom in 2021. Although Baja California Sur only recorded 7 violent home invasions in 2021, the state recorded 2,462 non-violent home burglaries. Truck hijackings are not common in Baja California Sur. The state reported only 2 cargo truck hijackings in 2021 and 1 during the first half of 2022. Given that organized crime groups in Baja California Sur are more focused on international drug trafficking than preying on local residents, it is likely that the current dynamics of common crime will hold steady over the next two years.\n\nThe criminal underworld in Baja California Sur is dominated by the New Generation Cartel of Jalisco. Because of the lack of competition between cartels, Baja California Sur enjoys a paz narco. Because of the ongoing presence of high level organized crime activity in Baja California Sur there is risk of public shootouts in Baja California Sur. Los Cabos is not considered to be a hotspot for organized crime-related violence. Companies that export products from Baja California Sur to the U.S. face some risk that criminal groups will try and pressure employees to collude in efforts to smuggle drugs into the U.S. Most exporters are able to mitigate this risk with rigorous internal control policies. Barring the death or arrest of a senior New Generation Jalisco Cartel member or the incursion of a rival group, it is likely that the current paz narco will remain intact for the next two years. In August 2022, the New Generation Jalisco Cartel launched a series of public attacks in the state of Baja California, north of Baja California Sur. In 2022, the New Generation Jalisco Cartel has adopted “narco-terrorism” tactics including burning businesses and shooting and killing innocent civilians. So far, the group has not engaged in this type of attack in Baja California Sur. It is possible in the future that similar security issues could affect Baja California Sur.\n\nAlthough extortion by criminal groups is a potential risk for businesses operating in Mexico, it is not a major problem in most sectors in Baja California Sur. Extortion by criminal groups may be an issue in rural areas of Baja California Sur and for local fishermen. The number of open investigations for cases of extortion in Baja California Sur increased from 38 during the first half of 2021 to 71 during the first half of 2022. There are no recent news stories of hotels or restaurants in Los Cabos being burned down by criminals, a tactic used by extortionists in other parts of Mexico. It is unlikely that organized crime groups in Baja California Sur will start threatening and extorting established, formal-sector businesses over the next two years.\n\nOverall, in terms of the threats posed by organized crime, security issues, and political instability Baja California Sur has a favorable political risk outlook.",
    "When is the NFL game in Mexico in 2022 and which teams play?": "The NFL will be taking its show on the road once again this year and this time, we’ve got a game in Mexico City, but who’s playing and when? Let’s find out!\n\n49ers vs Cardinals in Mexico City has a history\n\nWhen the NFL regular season gets underway this year, there’s one game in particular that Latin American fans of the game will be looking forward to and that’s the showdown between the San Francisco 49ers and the Arizona Cardinals. Set for Monday, November 21st at the Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, fans will be able to take in the clash between two of the league’s more recognizable teams. Interestingly, this will mark the first time that the 49ers and Cardinals are playing in Mexico City since playing the NFL’s very first regular-season international game back on October 2nd, 2005.\n\nOn this day in 2005, the #NFL played its first game outside of 🇺🇸\n\n\n\nThe Cardinals beat the 49ers 31-14 in Mexico City 🇲🇽#BovadaSportsHistory\n\n\n\npic.twitter.com/WI85p8dcUy — Bovada (@BovadaOfficial) October 2, 2021\n\nAt that time, the game drew a then record crowd of 103,467 and featured rookie quarterback Alex Smith making his NFL debut. Smith, who was the No. 1 overall pick in the NFL Draft that year, replaced 49ers’ starting quarterback Tim Rattay in the fourth quarter of the team’s 31-14 loss. Indeed, on the day, the 49ers scored two defensive touchdowns in the first seven minutes of the game and never scored again. Cardinals fans will of course be quick to remind doubters, that their team has won eight of the previous 11 head-to-head meetings against the 49ers, including both games last season.\n\nWhere do the 49ers and Cardinals stand right now?\n\nAs they prepare for their date in Mexico City, the 49ers will likely be weighing up the possibility of spending the week before the game practicing and training at the Air Force Academy. In truth, one team in each of the past three Mexico City games spent time in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in an effort to get acclimated to the high altitude before heading out to the game. The Cardinals on the other hand, have got some personnel problems. Though he will be eligible to play for them in Mexico City, wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins was recently suspended six games for violating the NFL’s policy on performance-enhancing substances. How that will affect his and the Cardinals approach, remains to be seen.\n\nWhen is the 49ers vs Cardinals in Mexico City?\n\nAs mentioned before the game between the San Francisco 49ers and Arizona Cardinals will take place on Monday, November 21st, at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, Mexico. Kickoff is scheduled for 8:15 p.m. ET. In case you’re wondering how this affects the teams’ overall slate of games, the 49ers most definitely stand to benefit as they will now see their 17-game schedule featuring nine home games, seven true road games and of course the one neutral site faceoff in Mexico’s capital city. A vast improvement on the extensive travel that they were forced to deal with last season. Curious about the entire slate of international games? Just take a look below:",

He celebrated Mexico's identity, its culture, its indigenous people; he also acknowledged the challenges the country faces.\n\n\"Death to corruption, death to classism, death to racism!\" López Obrador said in Spanish. Responding to each phrase, the crowd shouted, \"Muera!\" (Die!)\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Eduardo Verdugo/AP Eduardo Verdugo/AP\n\nEstimates of the huge crowd's size varied. At one point, Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum said she was told 130,000 people were in the square; as the night crept into the early hours of Friday, she reported an even bigger number: 140,000.\n\nIt was Mexico's first full-fledged Independence Day celebration since the COVID-19 pandemic dampened 2020's event, and people responded with glee, wearing green, white and red paint and bushy fake mustaches.\n\nThe crowd braved periodic rainfall, rewarded with a concert by norteño legends Los Tigres del Norte.\n\nThe government issued a video of the celebration, showing a military honor guard presenting Mexico's tricolor flag to López Obrador, followed by his invocation to the crowd, the national anthem and a large fireworks show.\n\nYouTube\n\nAs is traditional, when the president finished his brief speech he repeatedly yanked on a long sash to ring a bell perched high in the palace's wall — the same church bell the priest Miguel Hidalgo rang 212 years ago in the town of Dolores, signaling the start of the war against Spain and the fight for Mexico's future.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alfredo Estrella/AFP via Getty Images Alfredo Estrella/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe festivities extended beyond Mexico City and Mexico's borders.

    "Mexico's Aeromar Defies Economic Woes With Two New Route Launches": "Aeromar is looking to increase its connectivity in the Mayan region.\n\nThe Mexican carrier Aeromar has recently launched new routes departing from Mérida International Airport (MID). Although the airline seems to be facing financial troubles, it continues to grow by adding point-to-point connectivity throughout Mexico, employing its ATR-based fleet.\n\nThe new routes\n\nOn Monday, Aeromar announced the consolidation of its regional offer by launching two new routes connecting Mérida with Cozumel International Airport (CZM) and Chetumal International Airport (CTM).\n\nThe Merida-Cozumel route began operations on September 18th and has four weekly frequencies, while the Merida-Chetumal route began operations on Monday and has six weekly frequencies. The airline employs its ATR fleet to operate these two routes. Aeromar has six active aircraft currently, two ATR 42-600 and four ATR 72-600, according to data by ch-aviation. These planes have the capacity to carry up to 48 and 72 passengers, respectively.\n\nDuring the inauguration of the routes, Juan Ignacio Rossello, Aeromar's commercial director, said,\n\n“With these new routes, Aeromar consolidates itself as an option for regional travel and confirms that the company has concrete plans for development and expanding in the short, medium and long term, based on the strengthening of the business plan. We continue working on increasing our air connectivity and betting on new routes and destinations, on which we think there is a great opportunity for recovery and development; in this way, passengers can have an alternative journey and the best experience when flying with Aeromar.”\n\nFrom Mérida, Aeromar currently operates two weekly flights to Havana, Cuba.\n\nAeromar recently launched two new routes departing from Mérida. Photo: Guillermo Quiroz Martínez via @gquimar\n\nFlying with Aeromar\n\nAeromar is one of the oldest airlines still active in Mexico. Additionally, it is the only ATR operator in this country, mainly serving point-to-point routes appealing to the business traveler. However, it is also looking to cater to the leisure traveler.\n\nAs of September 2022, the airline operates around 270 flights per week on 24 routes, including a few international such as flights from Guadalajara International Airport, Mexico City Benito Juárez International, and Monterrey International to McAllen, Texas.\n\nThe airline is far from fully recovering compared to 2019 levels, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to data by Cirium, Aeromar is offering 46.5% fewer flights and 48.9% fewer seats this month compared to September 2019. Operationally, this lack of capacity has led to lower passenger numbers, carrying only 235,648 passengers between January and July 2022, versus the 449,189 passengers carried three years ago. That’s a 47% decrease compared to pre-pandemic traffic levels.\n\nAeromar flies to 24 destinations, including McAllen and Havana. After Mexico City (where it has 85 landings per week), Puerto Vallarta (PVR), Guadalajara (GDL), and Zihuatanejo (ZIH) are Aeromar’s top destinations.\n\nThe crisis\n\nEarlier this year, it was reported that Aeromar was on the brink of disappearing. The airline owes at least US$3.5 million in fuel to the State fuel provider. It is also in heavy debt with its labor force and Mexico’s tax authority. The pilot union of Aeromar recently stated that there are at least two investors interested in saving Aeromar. If Aeromar were to disappear, it would become the second Mexican airline to cease operations following the COVID-19 pandemic. The first one was Interjet.\n\nWhat do you think about Aeromar’s new routes? Let us know in the comments below.",
    "Mexico's Big Bet on the Future of Fossil Fuels Will Get Help from a Canadian Pipeline Company": "Mexico's Big Bet on the Future of Fossil Fuels Will Get Help from a Canadian Pipeline Company\n\n09.26.2022 By TankTerminals.com - NEWS\n\nSeptember 26, 2022 [Financial Post] – Deal with TC Energy called ‘crucial’ for North America\n\nMexico is making a big bet on the future of fossil fuels with some help from a Canadian pipeline giant.\n\nBucking broad global sentiment urging a shift away from fossil fuels, Mexico is building a large oil refinery on its Gulf Coast, in the southeastern state of Tabasco. Once operational, the new refinery is expected to expand Mexico’s oil-processing capacity by 20 per cent, while reducing its dependence on imported gasoline, diesel and jet fuel.\n\nAssisting Mexico with its energy ambitions is the $4.5-billion Southeast Gateway Pipeline project, announced last month by Calgary-based TC Energy Corp.\n\nThe pipeline will carry up to 1.3 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas to the southeast region of Mexico, and, crucially, offers up an additional power source for the new state-owned Olmeca Dos Bocas refinery.\n\nTabasco Governor Carlos Manuel Merino Campos, who is visiting Canada this week, said the pipeline will deliver gas that could be used to power the refinery as well as other industrial firms in the growing region. Merino Campos also said the deal with TC Energy shows the country’s openness to foreign investment — a remark that appeared to rebut recent trade complaints from the United States suggesting that Mexico’s energy strategy discriminates against foreign companies.\n\n“This agreement with (TC Energy) is something necessary for Mexico and it shows that Mexico wants to have private investors in our country,” said Merino Campos.\n\nTC Energy will partner with Mexico’s state-owned electric utility, Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE), the utility’s first public-private partnership, to build the 715-kilometre offshore pipeline.\n\nThe project is anticipated to be in-service by 2025, just three years after the joint final investment decision was announced — a pace that appears blistering compared with the hurdles and delays connected with another high-profile TC Energy project, the controversial Coastal GasLink pipeline.\n\nThe Canadian pipeline company may find Mexico to be a particularly hospitable jurisdiction at the moment thanks to Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s desire to build out infrastructure to end the country’s reliance on imported fuels and become energy self-sufficient.\n\nTabasco’s secretary for economic development and competitiveness called the deal with TC Energy “crucial” for North America, particularly in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the disruption to global energy supplies.\n\n“We must work together to have this energy sovereignty, to help our countries face all the financial threats or the energy threats that we may have,” said Jose Friedrich Garcia Mallitz. “This project is showing this bond because the gas is going to come from the United States, the pipeline is going to come from Canada and Mexico is going to benefit from all of this work together as a team.”\n\nTC Energy is also poised to benefit significantly from its latest venture in Mexico.\n\nMexican assets currently contribute roughly seven per cent of TC Energy’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and are projected to grow to roughly 12 to 14 per cent of EBITDA in 2026, according to an analysis by RBC Capital Markets.\n\nThe deal has also resolved a protracted dispute between CFE and TC Energy over fees the Canadian company was to earn from two other pipeline projects.\n\nThe two companies have agreed to terminate arbitration proceedings, with TC Energy earning a return on previous capital invested, the company said in August.\n\nTC Energy isn’t entering uncharted waters, having previously completed an offshore natural gas pipeline, Sur de Texas, in Mexico in 2019.\n\nCEO François Poirier previously said the public-private partnership will develop critical energy infrastructure serving the growing central and southeast regions of Mexico.\n\n“The Southeast Gateway Pipeline will be TC Energy’s second marine natural gas pipeline in Mexico, connecting to the coastal regions of Veracruz and Tabasco, and is another prime example of our ability to originate world-class projects that offer incremental growth to our long-term outlook,” Poirier said in an Aug. 4 statement.\n\nThe trade delegation from Tabasco met with executives at TC Energy in Calgary this week before making stops in Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal.\n\nThe visit comes as a quiet battle may be brewing between Mexico and its allies over Mexico’s direction on energy which its northern neighbours argue could violate the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA).\n\nU.S. trade representatives have warned that Lopez Obrador’s policies privilege state-owned oil producer Pemex and electricity provider CFE.

    "Mexico to hand army control of National Guard, sparking outcry": "Opposition lawmakers pledge to challenge contentious bill, which rights groups say gives too much power to the military.\n\nMexico’s Senate has passed legislation that would transfer control of the country’s National Guard over to the military, a contentious move that rights groups and opposition lawmakers say gives too much power to the armed forces and could lead to abuses.\n\nThe Senate’s 71-51 vote in favour of the bill on Friday comes after the lower house of Congress already approved the measure. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is expected to sign it into law.\n\nWhen the National Guard was created under a constitutional reform in 2019, it was placed under civilian control – but most of its training and recruitment has been done from within the country’s military.\n\nLopez Obrador, commonly referred to as AMLO, has waved aside concerns over the increased militarisation of public security, saying the guard must now be under military command to prevent corruption.\n\nBut opposition parties have said they plan to file court appeals challenging the new legislation, which they argue violates the Constitutional guarantee on civilian control.\n\n“Public safety is not achieved by violating the rule of law, by violating the Constitution,” said Senator Claudia Anaya Mota of the Institutional Revolutionary Party.\n\nThe Mexican military has been criticised for a record of abuses and rights groups have warned that removing civilian control over the National Guard could lead to similar violations.\n\n“We have already seen the disastrous results of the militarization of public security forces in Mexico over the last 16 years,” Edith Olivares Ferreto, executive director of Amnesty International Mexico, said in a statement on Friday, criticising the Senate’s decision.\n\n“We call on the executive branch to design a plan for the progressive withdrawal of the armed forces from the streets, prioritizing the strengthening of civilian police forces and the development of public prevention policies aimed at guaranteeing public safety.”\n\nNada Al-Nashif, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, also said that “the reforms effectively leave Mexico without a civilian police force at the federal level, and further consolidate the already prominent role of the armed forces in security in Mexico”.\n\n“The security forces should be subordinated under civilian authorities,” Al-Nashif said in a statement.\n\nBut Lopez Obrador on Friday lashed out at critics, including the United Nations.\n\n“When did the United Nations take a stand?” he said during a regular news conference, questioning what the body had done to prevent war from breaking out between Russia and Ukraine.\n\n“These organisations that supposedly defend human rights, almost all these organisations are made up of people on the right from different countries of the world … because they earn a lot of money for simulating, for pretending, for being go-betweens for authoritarian governments,” he said.\n\nMexico has seen record levels of violence in recent years, and members of the opposition and activists have accused the National Guard of various cases of abuse.\n\nThe ranks of the National Guard, made up of more than 110,000 members, are largely filled with members of the army and marines. Those officers retained their place in the military and were considered on loan to the guard.\n\nBefore coming to power in 2018, Lopez Obrador had pledged to send the military back to the barracks. But he has tasked them with a wide variety of assignments, including fighting drug cartels, helping with various infrastructure projects, such as a new airport in the capital, and building bank branches in rural areas.\n\nLate last month, a Truth Commission investigating the 2014 disappearance of 43 students said that six of the students were handed over to an army commander who ordered that they be killed. The shocking revelation directly tied the military to one of Mexico’s worst human rights scandals.",
    "Mexico values its Sonora lithium deposits at $600bn": "MEXICO CITY - A potentially vast lithium deposit in Mexico's northern Sonora state could be worth as much as 12-trillion Mexican pesos ($602-billion), according to a recent finance ministry report, or over a third of the country's projected economic output this year.\n\nMexico hopes its reserves of the key battery component will help it benefit from a global shift toward electric vehicle production that has turbo-charged demand, but experts are skeptical it will be able to quickly mobilize its industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nLithium prices have soared to surpass $70 000/t this year.\n\nWhile the ultra-light white metal is typically extracted from rock or brine deposits, lithium in Sonora is mostly trapped in clay soils, from which it has not yet been mined on a commercial scale.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nPresident Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has urged the private sector to work with the new state miner, saying the size of the investment needed means the government needs partners.\n\nBut analysts argue that companies are more likely to focus near-term investments in Chile or Argentina's sprawling salt flats, where industries are more established and policies more market-friendly.\n\nThe massive projected lithium demand should, however, eventually draw interest to Mexico, they added.\n\n\"We have a product which can define what will happen with the world's energy,\" Bolivia's Mexico ambassador Jose Crespo said in a statement published on Thursday.\n\nMexican newspaper La Jornada reported the government's lithium valuation earlier on Thursday.\n\nThough Mexico does not currently produce the metal, the finance ministry estimated the Sonora reserves could add some 0.3 percentage points to potential GDP in the medium-term.",

    "Big questions before Mexico's pre-World Cup friendlies: Injuries, leadership, and the 'quinto partido'": "Only two months separate the Mexico men's national team from their World Cup group-stage opener against Poland on Nov. 22. Before the trip to Qatar, El Tri have two upcoming friendlies in California, against Peru (Sept. 24) at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena and against Colombia (Sept. 27) at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara.\n\n- World Cup bracket and fixtures schedule\n\nLeading into the games, there have been few signs of Mexico shaking off the rust that made World Cup qualifying and previous friendlies a strenuous ordeal for manager Gerardo \"Tata\" Martino and his roster. During a news conference on Tuesday, themes of injury worries, fan discontent and leadership issues surrounded the team that have just one win in their last five.\n\nMexico have been far from their best, and with the hopes of them gaining some much-needed confidence this month, here are a few questions that continue to linger above them before the World Cup.\n\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, MLS, more (U.S.)\n\nWill ill-timed injuries haunt Mexico?\n\nIdeally, Martino would have his top players available for upcoming friendlies as they prepare for the World Cup. Instead, he'll now have to continue his groundwork without some of his high-profile names.\n\nMartino said star striker Raul Jimenez has \"no chance\" of playing this week because of injury. Martino made no guarantees that the Wolverhampton Wanderers frontman will be at the World Cup either, stating that \"I never thought we would be in this situation. ... I do have to give it a lot of thought.\"\n\nWhile with the squad, Jimenez is doing recovery training along Ajax Amsterdam's Jorge Sanchez and Monterrey duo Rogelio Funes Mori and Luis Romo, who are all set to depart camp before the game against Colombia. Houston Dynamo FC midfielder Hector Herrera is also a doubt and is currently being evaluated by the medical team.\n\nAlong with the serious leg injury for Sevilla's Jesus \"Tecatito\" Corona in August that will likely keep him out of the World Cup -- although Martino did note that they are going to re-examine him in early October -- Mexico now suddenly have a little over a third of their best XI not fully healthy.\n\nThat now means that the next two games will be key in finding those who can step up as possible replacements. Backups like Henry Martin, Santiago Gimenez, Diego Lainez, Orbelin Pineda, Erick Gutierrez, Luis Chavez, Kevin Alvarez and others should all get opportunities to claim minutes and push away any worries regarding injuries. That said, if solutions don't arise, the skepticism around El Tri will only grow stronger before the World Cup.\n\nIs there an El Tri leadership void?\n\nWhen things have gotten tough for Mexico, which has essentially been the last year or so, many fans and media have yearned for old school leaders like the eccentrically brash Cuauhtemoc Blanco or the more stoic and resolute Rafael Marquez.\n\nA perceived lack of strong-willed guidance has become a talking point, but is that necessarily valid?\n\n\"They say there are no leaders in the national team, that's not true. They say it because they are looking for the leader from the past: the grouch, a scolder, the one who demonstrates, and that has changed,\" said captain Andres Guardado on Tuesday about a supposed lack of commanding names.\n\nGuardado later made a good point by recognizing that he prefers to be a more open and approachable kind of captain. Instead of dishing out the \"rigid and cold\" conversations he dealt with as a younger player, he likes to be light-hearted and has been more involved in the transition of new players into the squad.\n\nMexico will rely on veteran leadership such as Andres Guardado and Guillermo Ochoa at the World Cup. Omar Vega/Getty Images\n\nThat said, there should probably also be a transition into different leaders for Mexico as well. As important as Guardado is in the locker room, the same can't be said on the pitch where he is no longer a guaranteed member of the starting XI. Other veterans such as Herrera and Hector Moreno are also on the cusp of being replaced, if not already, in their starting positions.\n\nGuillermo Ochoa is an unquestionable member of the XI, and almost sounded like a politician on Tuesday as he proclaimed that \"in the hour that a Mexican has to close ranks, we all close ranks,\" but his influence as a leader remains held to the net and not as a field player.\n\nIt's unlikely that we'll suddenly see the captain's armband handed to a younger name over the next couple of friendlies, but there should be an ambition for level-headed or hard-working players like Edson Alvarez, Cesar Montes or Gutierrez to step up and potentially be new guiding forces into the World Cup.\n\nAnd what about that quinto partido?\n\nIt's a national obsession that is synonymous with the national team: the quinto partido.\n\nTranslated to \"the fifth game,\" the saying marks a desperate desire for Mexico to qualify for the quarterfinals of the World Cup -- and thereby playing a fifth game -- after previously exiting in the round of 16 for seven consecutive tournaments.\n\nAs impressive as it is that Mexico has always gone past the group stage since the 1994 World Cup, the fact that the team has gone through a similar fate in seven tournaments seems to symbolize a stagnation, and not growth, for the national team structure.\n\nAt the moment, stagnation leading to regression seems to be more relevant for El Tri. Martino himself admitted that he believes his squad were playing at their best through 2019-20 and not in the last year or so -- in which they've failed to win the CONCACAF Nations League and Gold Cup, while also going four consecutive games without a victory against their U.S. rivals.\n\nTime is running out for him to steer Mexico back on track and possibly reach that fifth game, but if there's any glimmer of a chance that it could happen, convincing results against Peru and Colombia would be huge steps in the right direction.\n\nplay 1:26 Gomez: Mexico have knocked it out the park with new kit Herc Gomez can't hide his love for the new Mexico away kit and training jacket.\n\nOn the path towards doing so, Alvarez opened up on Tuesday about Mexico's squad visualizing that quinto partido.\n\n\"We always think about it, but it's something that we need to keep calm in our heads, because if we go there [to Qatar] with this in our minds, it's not good for us,\" said the midfielder.\n\nIt's going to be a fine balance between having an aim but not overthinking the goal, and in the process of fighting for the accomplishment, two wins would work wonders in building confidence before the World Cup.\n\nJimenez spoke about the quinto partido as well. He possibly had the funniest response, and perhaps even the perfect mindset, when asked what the most important factor to making it to the fifth game was: \"Winning the fourth one.\"",

A wheelbarrow full of mangos sat to one side. This is where Jorge Sánchez Ordóñez, 36, does most of his journalism. It’s also the house from which his father was kidnapped seven years ago. The home looks more imposing now than it did then. After the abduction, workers for the Federal Mechanism for the Protection of Human Rights Workers and Journalists installed security cameras and a metal fence crowned with barbed wire.\n\nWhen Jorge Sánchez leaves the property, he wears a plain black T-shirt and jeans; he wants to look nondescript, especially as he delivers the tamales and chiles rellenos that his family sells to fund his work. But when he arrives at a scene to report, he pulls out his single-lens reflex camera, hangs a press pass from the rearview mirror of his car, and puts on a navy-blue vest with his father’s name embroidered under the slogan, “To live with fear is not an option.”\n\nJorge Sánchez is one of a handful of volunteer journalists at La Unión, the publication that his father, Moisés Sánchez Cerezo, founded. The paper has grown from its early days in the 1980s when it was a flyer handed out around town. Now it’s a digital outlet with more than 17,000 Facebook followers and an occasional print edition. It remains free, ensuring that everyone in the community can read it.\n\nLa Unión’s focus is denuncia social, or social criticism—essentially local accountability reporting. It’s an emphasis that has proved deadly for journalists in Mexico, including Moisés Sánchez, whose body was found weeks after his kidnapping with signs of torture.\n\nOutside of active war zones, Mexico is the most dangerous country in the world for media workers. Since 2005, more than 30 reporters have been killed in the state of Veracruz alone. On September 19 at The Hague, the People’s Tribunal on the Murder of Journalists, which was organized by a group of media freedom organizations, declared Mexico (along with Sri Lanka and Syria) “guilty of all the human rights violations brought against them.” The unofficial court has no legal authority, but Miguel Ángel López Solana, the son of assassinated journalist Miguel Ángel López Velasco, read aloud part of the verdict at a public event in Veracruz.\n\nIt’s not only international groups trying to raise awareness about the attacks against reporters. The Network in Memory and Struggle for Assassinated or Disappeared Journalists, which was founded earlier this year, includes representatives from 14 families with relatives of murdered media workers. While it is the first collective in Mexico to unite around victims who were journalists, it is part of a long history of memory work in Latin America.\n\n“Mexico is a country with no memory,” said Patricia Espinosa, a preschool teacher in Mexico City whose brother Rubén Espinosa, a photojournalist, was killed in 2015. “Something happens today, and right now it’s news, and right now it’s important, but after a few months it’s no longer material.… We’ve gotten used to living with this quantity of cases.”\n\nAccording to Artículo 19, an NGO dedicated to press freedom in Mexico and Central America, the majority of documented aggressions against Mexican journalists are committed by government officials. The founders of the Network say the government has conducted smear campaigns against their deceased family members, bungled forensic processes, and mishandled their cases. Yet the group’s mission is not just to demand justice within the judicial system; with 98 percent of journalist murders in the country going unpunished, members told me that this goal often seems out of reach. The organization also commemorates murdered reporters and photographers, honors their work, and publicly and accurately discusses their assassinations to raise the political cost of future killings.\n\nThe Argentinian sociologist Elizabeth Jelin describes this type of memory work as part of a broader movement to confront large-scale impunity. In her book State Repression and the Labors of Memory, she writes, “Memory, truth, and justice blend into each other, because the meaning of the past that is being fought about is, in fact, part and parcel of the demand for justice in the present.”\n\nThis year, 15 media workers have been murdered in Mexico in possible retaliation for their reporting. After years of running into one another at protests and memorials for their dead relatives, the members of what would become the Network began to organize this spring as three more journalists from Veracruz were killed: José Luis Gamboa, Yesenia Mollinedo Falconi, and Sheila Johana García Olivera.\n\nYazmín López Solana, a nurse, and Isabel Luna Varela, an office worker, have been friendly for years, because their relatives worked together at a newspaper before they were killed in separate attacks. Yazmín López told me that when heard about this year’s murders she felt like the 11 years since the assassination of her family members had frozen, “and I was sitting here once again.”\n\nIsabel Luna added, “It feels really ugly to think that another family is going through the same thing.”\n\nJorge Sánchez, the Network’s spokesperson, has been demanding that the government hold the killers of journalists accountable. He has received threats related to both his reporting and his activism. Such threats are part of why he said it made sense for surviving family members to form a collective. “Imagine that they’ve just assassinated your relative,” he explained to me. “You have to travel. You have to look for lawyers.… On top of that, the fear of what you’re going to do, will you flee? You have to take care of yourself. They call you. They threaten you. You don’t sleep.” Helping others out with this combination of circumstances, he said, is a major reason the organization is so necessary.\n\nAs the Network grows, Jorge Sánchez said he hopes it can expand to support members in other states, but for now it’s a challenge just to coordinate the group in Veracruz, which covers nearly 30,000 square miles. The Network is fundraising for its members’ travel expenses so it can host more in-person events—whether those are talks with organizations dedicated to journalist safety, protests following a journalist’s death, or a chance to meet with the government about their cases. In August, they met with nine federal and state organizations to insist that “their petitions and agreements don’t stay in the realm of ‘goodwill’ or ‘empty words,’ rather that there be a real commitment on the part of the government bodies to follow up on the cases and make positive progress.”\n\nSurvivors told me repeatedly that being related to an assassinated journalist comes with challenges. In 2012, after her brother Guillermo Luna Varela, a photojournalist for Veracruz News, and uncle Gabriel Huge, a former reporter for NOTIVER, were murdered alongside Irasema Becerra, her colleague at El Dictamen, Isabel Luna was fired from her job selling ads. “I think maybe they didn’t want to deal with another death,” she said.\n\nFears of relatives’ being killed are not unfounded. When gunmen shot dead Yazmín López’s father, Miguel Ángel López Velasco, then the director of crime reporting at NOTIVER, they also murdered her mother, Agustina Solana, an employee of the Mexican Institute of Social Security, and her brother Misael López Solana, a budding photojournalist.\n\nShortly afterward, Yazmín López said she was driving in Veracruz when “a ton of people armed with long guns” blocked her path, forced her from her truck, and stole the vehicle. It wasn’t clear whether the robbery was related to the assassination, but she worried that it might be and spent years afraid to speak out.\n\nYazmín López told me anomalies have also plagued many of the investigations. “We ourselves, the family, mopped up the blood from how they left the bodies,” she said. “They left the blood, and they never came back to pick up the bullets. We found the bullets. We found the casings. We found pieces of teeth.… The police never did a good job collecting evidence.”\n\nPartly because of the mismanagement of the crime scene, Yazmín López believes that her family’s murderers will never be brought to justice. This summer, in a ceremony attended by the Network, Yazmín López’s surviving brother, with the support of Reporters Without Borders, mounted a plaque in their honor in Veracruz. Having a place to mourn has meant a lot to Yazmín López. “There are people that don’t have a place to go to cry over their family,” she said. “There are people who still haven’t found their family members.… I want them to feel what I’m feeling in this moment.”\n\nThere’s a pattern in Veracruz, Jorge Sánchez told me, in which the government officials charged with finding the killers blame the victim by tying the person to other forms of crime. This tars the journalist, their surviving family, and their colleagues as undeserving of justice and creates room for the government to close the case without investigating itself.\n\nJust days before his disappearance, Jorge’s father, Moisés Sánchez, told his family that he’d heard that the mayor, Omar Cruz Reyes, had threatened him in a private meeting. It took months before the state congress authorized an investigation into Cruz, and in the interim, he fled the state. Seven years later, he remains at large.\n\nAfter Moisés Sánchez’s disappearance, federal police showed up at the family home with surprising news: They had found explosives in the trunk of the taxi he drove to support his work with La Unión. But the Sánchez family had taken photos of the car, including inside the trunk, when Moisés Sánchez was kidnapped, and no explosives were present.\n\n“So then, because they could see that we had proof that their accusation was false, they had to desist, and they didn’t continue with that angle,” Jorge Sánchez said.\n\nJorge Sánchez isn’t exactly sure what the police were trying to achieve by planting explosives in his father’s taxi. Perhaps, he said, they were trying to imply that he “worked for a terrorist cell, or something like that.” But the family has been vigilant in protecting Moisés Sánchez’s legacy—including pushing back against the government’s attempts to minimize his journalism. After Moisés Sánchez was kidnapped, the governor of Veracruz himself referred to him, dismissively, as a “taxi driver and neighborhood activist.”\n\nLater in 2015, when unknown assailants assassinated Rubén Espinosa alongside Nadia Vera, Yesenia Quiroz, Mile Virginia Martín, and Alejandra Negrete in Mexico City, the local attorney general’s office published toxicology reports indicating that Espinosa and Vera had consumed drugs. The government also investigated rumors that Martín, a Colombian model, was a sex worker, based mainly on her nationality and profession.\n\nFor Patricia Espinosa, Rubén Espinosa’s sister, those speculations are beside the point. “It’s a method that the authorities and their allies in the media use to stain the image of the people [involved], so that society will say ‘Ah, well… That’s why they were assassinated,’” she told me. “The authorities, instead of looking at the perpetrators, turn their gaze on the victims.”\n\nOn the anniversary of the assassinations in Mexico City, activists and family members hold a festival called “Arte Para No Olvidarte,” or “Art So I Won’t Forget You.” Outside the apartment where the five were shot, the group conducts a ceremony to “resignify the space,” followed by performances and the testimonies of family members. This year, there was a demonstration in the Veracruz state capital as well.\n\nItzamná Ponce and Daniela Guillén, who help organize Arte Para No Olvidarte every year, told me that in the face of actions intended to provoke terror, joy is an important form of resistance. “Smiles, dancing, partying…art, music, laughter, hugs, tenderness, for us have been those spaces of searching and demanding justice and struggling,” Ponce said. “From that place, what we’ve tried to do is this: to generate a space of resistance out of our smiles. Because that’s something they’re trying to take away from us.”\n\nOn a humid summer evening, many of the neighbors in Fraccionamiento Arboledas San Miguel, a neighborhood in Medellín de Bravo, were outside searching for a breeze. There was a soccer game in progress, and near the pitch, a handful of people had gathered around an exposed electrical cable. Jorge Sánchez stood with them, camera in hand, as they explained how the neighborhood’s developer was refusing to reroute the cables underground. They told him that the exposed cable posed a fire risk to the neighborhood, that there was no street lighting at night, and that uncovered manholes lined the roads. A teen had even fallen into a manhole and injured his hand.\n\nThe next morning, Jorge Sánchez wrote up the article. “Those affected said that since VIVEICA, the developer which built the neighborhood, declared bankruptcy, no one has taken an interest in or attended to the neighborhood’s problems, evidenced by the fact that they now have been living for more than a month without adequate electrical service,” he reported in the piece.\n\nThis might seem like straightforward journalism, but for Jorge Sánchez, it’s a rejection of fear. When he goes out to report, people remember him as a boy accompanying his father. They still call him “Moi”—short for Moisés. And as his father used to say, to live with fear is not an option. “If we’re afraid, we’ll never do anything. And things are going to stay the same,” Sánchez said. “We have to do something.”",

    "In Mexico, a 1,000-year-old site is declared an ancient monument, the first in a decade": "MEXICO CITY — An ancient Mexican site more than 1,000 years old has been declared the country’s first archaeological zone in a decade, antiquities institute INAH announced on Tuesday, despite several years of steep budget cuts for archeological research.\n\nCañada de la Virgen, the modern name of an ancient Otomi ceremonial center, is located near the picturesque mountain town and tourist destination of San Miguel de Allende.\n\nThe pre-Hispanic site features a large stone temple complex and other structures, many aligned with astronomical bodies, and is believed to have reached its peak around 600-900 AD, contemporaneous with dozens of major Maya cites.\n\nAncient Otomi settlements were mostly clustered around the present-day central Mexican states of Puebla, Hidalgo and Guanajuato, where Cañada de la Virgen is located, before being conquered by the Aztecs in the 14th century and incorporated into their sprawling empire.\n\nScholars believe an ancient version of the Otomi language, which is still spoken today, may have been the language spoken at Teotihuacán, the ancient metropolis near Mexico City and home to towering pyramids and temples.\n\nA stone pyramid at an ancient Otomi ceremonial center in Guanajuato, Mexico.

The president argues the project will promote development in Mexico’s poorer south while minimizing harm to the environment.\n\nFollow NBC Latino on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.",

    "The best and worst H-E-Bs in Texas and Mexico, according to Google": "For Valerie Placeres, the H-E-B in San Antonio’s Dignowity Hill neighborhood was way too small.\n\nLocated at the corner of New Braunfels Avenue and Houston Street on the city’s East Side, the grocery store had long lines and tiny aisles that stressed her out. She took to Google to vent her frustrations.\n\n“It smelled like pee in the soda aisle,” Placeres wrote in a recent review on Google. “This H-E-B will make your great mood flip to stressful as soon as you pull in the parking lot.\n\nThe H-E-B at 415 N. New Braunfels is tied with a store on Ed Bluestein Boulevard in Northeast Austin for the lowest-rated H-E-B in Texas and Mexico with 41. stars, according to Google.\n\nAmong the complaints from the customers were long lines and unfriendly employees.\n\nIn search of the best and worst H-E-B grocery stores in Texas and Mexico, the Express-News pulled Google Map ratings on hundreds of locations listed in the company’s directory. The newspaper only analyzed locations with at least 100 ratings. This list does not include Central Market, company convenience stores and other H-E-B offshoots.\n\nMore than 20 H-E-Bs in Texas have a 4.7 rating on Google. Three of them are in San Antonio, the home of the grocer’s headquarters. At 45 locations, the Alamo City is also home to the most H-E-Bs in Texas.\n\nJosie Norris/San Antonio Express-News\n\nDya Campos, the company’s director of government and public affairs, said “all forms of customer feedback are important to us” in response to emailed questions.\n\nRelated: 5 things to buy and 5 things to avoid at H-E-B in San Antonio\n\nAmong the San Antonio stores in the top 20, including the H-E-B on Bulverde Road and Loop 1604 on the Northwest Side. Visitors to this grocery store have lauded its wide aisles, stocked shelves, friendly staff and tasty barbecue from its True Texas BBQ restaurant.\n\nThe store also features True Texas Tacos located in the H-E-B convenience store on the property, which one local equated to being “the best tacos at any gas station.”\n\nTexas vs. Mexico\n\nTexas has a higher percentage of above-average H-E-B’s than tiendas across the border. Thirty-three percent of H-E-B's in Mexico have a rating of 4.4 percent. In comparison, 30 percent of H-E-B locations in Texas have a 4.6 rating.\n\nThere are three Mexico H-E-Bs with a 4.7 rating on Google, faring better than any of the 24 Texas grown grocery stores you’ll find in Austin. The highest rated store in the Texas Capitol is the Lakeline H-E-B Plus! with 4.6 stars.\n\nThe H-E-B in Torreón, a city in the Mexican state of Coahuila, is among the best in Mexico. It is rated 4.7 on Google. The H-E-B in Aguascalientes, a central Mexican city about three hours northwest of Guadalajara, has the most reviews on Google Maps. It enjoys a 4.6 star rating.\n\nThe store has 10,680 reviews, about 2,000 more than the Tower of the Americas. Customers have lauded the store for its produce and meat selection.\n\nThe San Antonio-based grocer has had a presence in Mexico for 25 years and has 75 stores south of the border.\n\n‘I can see why Texans love their H-E-B’\n\nHouston, home to 21 H-E-B stores, had two grocery stores at the top of the list. Among them was the Heights H-E-B at 2300 N. Shepherd Dr. in Northwest Houston. This massive store has a two-floor parking garage, and customers have praised it for its cleanliness, organization, product selection and friendly staff.\n\n“I can see why Texans love their H-E-B,” Dominik Sakowski wrote review last month. “The store’s very well maintained, clean and organized, everything nicely shelved and easy to find, well, besides the fact that there were so many options. As a bonus the lighting system for parking spaces stuck to me as clever and handy.”\n\nThe downsides of the store include a small vegan section and general frustrations about the rising cost of food, according to reviews on Google.\n\nS.A.

H-E-B has stores in Waxahachie and Ennis, which have 4.6 and 4.4 stars, respectively.\n\nRyan Moilan found it hard to navigate the throngs of customers inside one of the only H-E-Bs in North Texas. Moilan drove more than 12 miles from Midlothian to Waxahachie for the grocery trip and went on Google to talk about the lack of stores.\n\n“You need a Super H-E-B in Waxahachie,” wrote Moilan, who included a photo of the checkout line packed with customers. “Don’t tell me the numbers don’t support it. Guess I’ll go to Kroger cause it’s not worth the stress shopping here.”\n\n‘Ratchet stuff’\n\nThe lowest-rated stores in Texas are tied between two stores — the 415 N. New Braunfels location in San Antonio and the 7112 Ed Bluestein location in Austin. Both have 4.1 stars.\n\nIn a review five months ago about the Austin store, Timothy Smith wrote: “People stealing and fighting outside. Police searching people’s vehicles. Store wasn’t even stocked, had no salads. If you like ratchet stuff and empty shelves shop here. Otherwise go to another H-E-B.”\n\nHelen Alvarez, during a visit to the same store four months ago, had an entirely different experience.\n\n“This H-E-B has many friendly, open, and hard-working employees,” Alvarez wrote. “I’ve seen them confront customers that are a bit picky with professionalism, which I also appreciate.”\n\ntimothy.fanning@express-news.net"
