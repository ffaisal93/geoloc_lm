    "Uganda: Opposition kicks off Consultations on Copyright Law": "Opposition MPs have started holding stakeholder engagements with a view of improving a draft private Members’ Bill that seeks to amend the 2006 Copyright and Neighbouring Rights Act.\n\nThe Bill is sponsored by the Shadow Minister for Culture and Performing Arts, also Mawokota North MP, Hillary Innocent Kiyaga (NUP).\n\nThe first stakeholder meeting was held on Friday, September 23, 2022, at Parliament under the chairmanship of the Leader of the Opposition in Parliament (LOP), Hon Mathias Mpuuga, and drew the participation of officials from the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs led by the Deputy Solicitor General, Pius Biribonwoha, Uganda Registration Services Bureau (URSB) and representatives from the arts industry.\n\nThe proposed amendment seeks to close gaps in the 2006 law to recognize and protect the rights of a composer of artistic work and to streamline the registration of copyrights among others.\n\nThe Registrar General, Mercy Kainobwisho told the meeting that while her agency, URSB recognizes that there are gaps in the existing law coupled with implementation challenges, there is no need for a Private Members’ Bill her entity had already engaged Uganda Law Reform Commission to process an amendment that would lead to the domestication of international treaties on copyright and audiovisual performances.\n\n“The provisions of this Bill and the proposed amendments of the current Act may be parallel to the steps URSB is taking to amend the Act,” Kainobwisho said.\n\nHer submissions were however challenged by MPs, Abdulhu Byakatonda (Ind., Workers), Geoffrey Kayemba Solo (NUP, Bukomansimbi South) and Kiyaga. Their concerns were amplified by artistes, Hannington Bugingo (comedian) and Sylver Kyagulanyi from the Copyright Institute.\n\n“We wish to have this law amended in the areas of regulation, administration and protection. Regulation is so pertinent because we already have an existing issue with [Uganda Communications Commission] UCC,” Kyagulanyi said in reference to the stage plays and public performance rules which were announced by UCC in 2019.\n\n“We the creatives need to be regulated but what UCC is doing is an exhibition of the gap in the current law. UCC is using a 1964 draconian law – The Stage Plays and Public Entertainment Act which ought to be repealed. UCC would be within their mandate if they try to regulate broadcast but are trying to [stretch their mandate] to the regulation of everything including creativity and creative work,” he added.\n\nThe meeting later agreed to a harmonization of the positions of the two sides and hold joint consultations to have the legislation processed within the current financial year.\n\n“With these very good proposals, if we don’t sit and agree on the issues as we have heard them, we [risk] talking about the 2022 law the same way we are talking about the 2006 law,” Biribonwoha said.\n\nDistributed by APO Group on behalf of Parliament of the Republic of Uganda.",

The ministers also approved Standard Operating Procedures for handling ADF combatants who defect or surrender,” the statement reads in part.\n\nAccording to UPDF deputy spokesperson Col Deo Akiiki, the new extension will span two months as have the previous ones since the start of the operation.\n\n“The ongoing operations are normally reviewed after every two months by CDFs who then make recommendations to ministers of Defence,” he said.\n\nThe statement adds that the ministers reviewed the current situation in eastern DRC and ongoing joint operation code named Shuja, following the third meeting of Chiefs of Defence Forces that happened recently in Kampala.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUganda’s technical team was led by Maj Gen Dick Prit Olum, while FARDC was represented by Chief of General Staff Gen Célestin Mbala.\n\nIn November last year, the UPDF and their Congolese counterparts the Forces Armées de la République Démocratique du Congo (FARDC) launched a joint offensive against the ADF rebels.\n\nKampala sought Kinshasa’s permission to pursue the rebels, accusing them of orchestrating several assassinations of government officials, suicide bombings and recruiting of Ugandans to their ranks.\n\nThe ADF has been an anti-Uganda terrorist group since mid-1990s, but recently established links with the Islamic States of Syria and Iraq (ISIS).\n\nThe United Nations says the group is responsible for about 200 killings and displacement of 40,000 people in DRC from the 155 attacks they carried out in 2020 alone.\n\nThe joint operation is currently in its third phase, according to Maj Peter Mugisa, the spokesperson of the UPDF mountain brigade. This third phase involves chasing down fleeing insurgents who fled when officers of the joint military operation bombarded their hideouts.\n\nThis phase also includes securing communities, and recruiting and training local defence units that are left behind to thwart possible attacks from the rebels.\n\n“For the past one month, we have been pursuing these rebels to wherever they have been running and we are still doing exactly that,” Mugisa said.",
    "Uganda oil: One’s man’s poison is another man’s meat": "OPINION: European Union parliamentarians upped the ante against fossil fuel projects last week by passing a controversial resolution demanding a halt to work on a $20 billion project that aims to develop two oilfields in Uganda and send the oil along the East Africa Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) to Tanzania’s coast.\n\nThis provocative move against TotalEnergies’ mega-project prompted a blistering response from the Ugandan Parliament’s Deputy Speaker Thomas Tayebwa, who accused the EU of “economic racism”, saying the resolution was hypocritical and invoked bitter memories of colonialism and imperialism,\n\nHe argued that Europe should stop investing in its own fossil fuel projects, given its historic contribution to climate change, not Africa.",
    "Uganda rejects UN definition of abortion as a human right": "Uganda has joined several other African countries to oppose the contentious United Nations Human Rights Committee’s definition of abortion as a human right.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines abortion as termination of pregnancy prior to 20 weeks gestation.\n\nDr Jesca Nsungwa, the Commissioner for Maternal and Child Health at the Ministry of Health, told this publication yesterday that abortion in Uganda is illegal and that the country does not support UN definition of the act as a human right.\n\n“We don’t promote or support abortion in Uganda. We are pro-life and, therefore, we oppose that definition,” Dr Nsungwa said in telephone interview, “There are many things that are promoted as a human rights including homosexuality but we do not support them given our laws, culture and morals, “she added.\n\nInternational media reports indicate that a United Nations resolution defining abortion as a human right and advancing gender ideology was passed early this month, and was backed by majority of Western countries, but was rejected by others, especially from Africa.\n\nAccording to fsspx news, the resolution’s focus on abortion and gender ideology was criticised by 33 countries, mostly located in Africa.\n\nIt reported that among the 32 nations that joined Nigeria in supporting amendments to strike abortion and gender language from the resolution were Uganda, Cameroon, Ethiopia and Senegal. The Philippines, Nicaragua, Russia and a handful of Middle Eastern countries also joined the effort.\n\nSenegal’s representative condemned the inclusion of abortion as a method of family planning and argued that the word ‘gender’ should only refer to “social relations between men and women.”\n\nThe Deputy Speaker of Parliament, Mr Thomas Tayebwa, in April said that he would promote and protect human rights, including fighting abortion.\n\n“I promise the Parliament and the people of Uganda that I will do things that will give respect to God. Personally, I have values that I believe in. We must respect the lives of every individual including the unborn. I’m pro-life,” Mr Tayebwa emphasised.\n\nArticle 22 of the 1995 Constitution provides for the right to life and Article 22(2) clearly states that no one has the right to terminate an unborn child except if authorised by law.\n\nDr Nsungwa also said unsafe abortion is a vice that must be fought to save the lives of women and girls. According to the Ministry of Health, Uganda loses about 16 women and girls on a daily basis and complications arising from unsafe abortion account for about 22 percent of deaths.\n\nWHO abortion stand",
    "Inter-Agency Situation Report - Uganda Refugee Emergency (9 - 15 September 2022) - Uganda": "Uganda continues to receive new arrivals from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and South Sudan, through the Southwestern and Northern borders. The security situation in all operational areas is unpredictable as armed conflicts are still active in DRC and South Sudan.\n\nHeavy rains are causing delays and postponement of service delivery, flooding of settlement areas and damage to shelters as well as latrines.\n\nThe new arrival trends from South Sudan and DRC are high, putting pressure on available facilities at collection points and transit centres across the operation. The average latrine coverage ratio is 1:20 individuals. Due to the high numbers, it is now 1:434 individuals. The holding capacity at Nyakabande transit centre (Kisoro district) is overstretched by 87 per cent (capacity of 7,200 with 13,465 individuals currently).\n\nLokung collection point in Lamwo district, is over stretched by 261 per cent (capacity of 560 with 2,019 individuals currently), while Kagoma reception centre (Kikuube district) by 97 per cent (capacity of 1,000 holds 1966 individuals). The pressure is partly attributed to lack of core relief items (CRIs) affecting relocation to settlements. There is need for additional funds to cater for procurement of CRIs.",
    "Uganda: Is the First Lady flying above the vice president?": "Ugandan First Lady and Minister of Education and Sports Janet Kataha Museveni forced her way into politics in 2006 as a member of parliament, something that President Yoweri Museveni and other high-ranking members of the ruling party never supported. She became a junior minister three years later.\n\nPolitics is a path she never thought she would take, Janet wrote in her memoir, My Life’s Journey. “Of all things I thought I would ever do in my life, getting into active politics was never on my list,” she wrote. Janet, who is a devoted Christian, attributed her her change of mind to calling from God. ‘The idea seemed ludicrous,’ she wrote.\n\nJanet is ranked 10th on the order of precedence as per Uganda’s constitution and eight steps below the vice president, who is second to the president. But in recent months, the vice president has been representing the first lady at events, the most recent being when Alupo represented Janet in Israel at a graduation ceremony of Ugandan students whose education was sponsored by the Israeli government. Neither the president’s nor the vice president’s spokespeople responded to questions.",
    "Uganda condemns EU resolution slamming oil pipeline": "**Uganda slammed a resolution by the European Union’s Parliament calling for a halt to extractive activities in protected ecosystems in an oil pipeline project. The Deputy Speaker of the Ugandan National assembly slammed a \"deliberate misrepresentation of key facts\" in the resolution.\n\n**\n\nBy 2025, Uganda will have its oil coming out of the East Africa Crude Oil Pipeline as planned. The comments of leader Yoweri Museni reaffirmed his determination to have the project completed.\n\nHis reaction came Friday following a resolution by the European Union’s Parliament urging the international community \"to exert maximum pressure on Ugandan and Tanzanian authorities, as well as the project promoters and stakeholders,\" to stop oil activities around Lake Albert.\n\nUganda is estimated to have recoverable oil reserves of at least 1.4 billion barrels. In February, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation and TotalEnergies said that the total investment would be more than $10 billion. They have partnered with the Uganda National Oil Company, and the Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation\n\nThe national assembly issued a statement asserting Uganda’s sovereignty and condemning the EU parliament’s resolution. \"The resolution is based on misinformation and deliberate misrepresentation of key facts on environment and human rights protection. It represents the highest level on neo-colonialism and imperialism against the sovereignty of Uganda and Tanzania\", Thomas Tayebwa, the Deputy speaker of the assembly said.\n\nKampala says oil wealth can lift millions. When environmental Ngos like Friends of the Earth evaluated that over one hundred twenty thousand people will lose land to make way for the project.\n\nUnfair compensation\n\nCompensation was also an issue. If Ugandan civil society had already voiced that disclosed compensation was not fair, the resolution doubled down. Saying that some landowners \"had their homes destroyed to facilitate the construction of access roads or the processing plant, others have had all or part of their land requisitioned and have lost the free use of their properties and thus their means of subsistence, without prior payment of fair and adequate compensation; whereas the compensation paid is often far too low to allow farmers whose land has been expropriated to buy comparable land on which to continue farming [...]\". It, therefore, called for the authorities to \"compensate promptly, fairly, and adequately, as provided for in the Ugandan Constitution and as promised by the companies\" , \"those evicted or denied access to their land\" and \"people [who] lost property and land\".\n\nThe text also expressed its \"grave concern about the human rights violations in Uganda and Tanzania linked to investments in fossil-fuel projects, including the wrongful imprisonment of human rights defenders, the arbitrary suspension of NGOs, arbitrary prison sentences\".\n\nMuseveni said TotalEnergies had assured him that the pipeline — which would link oil fields in western Uganda to the Indian Ocean port of Tanga in Tanzania — would proceed but warned on Twitter that \"if the French energy group was to choose to listen to the EU Parliament, Uganda shall find another partner.\"",
    "US Overtakes Uganda in Buying Kenyan Goods": "New figures from Kenya's National Bureau of Statistics show the United States has overtaken Uganda as the largest buyer of Kenyan goods.\n\nThe numbers from Kenya's National Bureau of Statistics show that between January and June 2022, Kenya's exports to the United States totaled 38.8 billion Kenyan shillings — the equivalent of about $321 million.\n\nUganda's imports from Kenya dipped to about $300 million.\n\nAccording to the report, the jump was caused mainly by increased sales of Kenyan clothing apparel to the U.S.\n\nEconomists such as Ken Gichinga say the figures are a sign of Kenya’s deepening bilateral relationship with the U.S., including increased direct flights to New York.\n\n\"Americans have a bigger purchasing power for products in Kenya,\" Gichinga said. \"You find that American investors will find it a very good time to be able to purchase assets and buy things in Kenya because now, the market is in their favor.\"\n\nUganda has been the biggest buyer of Kenyan exports for over a decade. But a Kenyan publication, Business Daily, reports that Uganda's imports from Kenya have dropped as investors set up Ugandan factories to manufacture goods previously imported from Kenya, such as edible oils and cement.\n\nWangari Muikia, a Kenyan economist, said the country's strong relations with the U.S., backed by the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), will likely continue to thrive as the new government of President William Ruto is keen on more American partnerships.\n\nIn his visit to the United Nations General Assembly this week, Ruto met with U.S. State Department officials and pitched for increased business between the two nations.\n\n\"The new government is signaling pushing for greater trade with the U.S., with President Ruto meeting with the U.S. trade officials this week,\" Muikia said. \"Most excitingly in tech, where Kenya's Silicon Savannah is excelling now, a market like the U.S. will open up business for Kenya and the region.\"\n\nKenya is among African nations benefiting from a U.S. shift in foreign policy as it scales up its presence on the continent.

    "Uganda parliament considers organ transplant revolution": "The Ugandan Parliament is considering a bill that would make it possible for the first time to perform organ transplants in this East African country. A small revolution that would transform the lives of thousands of people waiting for surgery.\n\nIf the legislation is approved, Uganda will join African countries such as South Africa, Tunisia, and Kenya, which already have the regulations and health facilities in place to allow organ transplants to take place in their countries.\n\nIndia and Turkey are currently the most popular destinations for Ugandan kidney patients. Only close relatives are allowed to be donors and travel must be approved by the Uganda Medical Council - to avoid organ trafficking or people being forced to offer their organs.\n\nIf Parliament approves the new measure, the process should be simpler and the cost of surgery and recovery could be reduced to about $8,000 instead of $30,000 for a transplant abroad.\n\nProponents of the measure say Uganda needs special legislation to create a safe framework, subject to strict regulation, to ensure there is no abuse. Among them is Dr. Kharya, from the Centre for Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy in India. According to him, Uganda already has a good base in terms of a blood bank and laboratories.\n\nThe proposal calls for the creation of a national waiting list of organ recipients and the establishment of specialized transplant centers throughout the country. An operating theatre has already been set up at the main national hospital in Mulago, Kampala.\n\nOrgan banks will also be established for those who wish to donate, not just kidneys.",

    "Boycotts, ruling party meddling mark Uganda and Burundi Eala polls": "By JONATHAN KAMOGA More by this Author\n\nThe biggest opposition parties in Burundi and Uganda have boycotted the election of new members to join the East African Legislative Assembly (Eala), accusing their ruling parties of undemocratic dominance.\n\nThe region is counting down to the 5th Eala Assembly that kicks off in December. Kenya, just out of a general election, is expected to choose new Eala MPs as soon as the 13th parliament gets into session in the last week of September.\n\nTanzania, South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Kenya are yet to hold their nominations.\n\nIn Burundi, the biggest opposition party – National Congress for Liberty (CNL) – boycotted this week’s parliamentary election of national Eala members, accusing the government of disregarding the rule of law in the nomination of representatives to the regional assembly.\n\nThe 82 members of Burundi’s parliament present went ahead with the process. Parliament has 104 members.\n\nAgathon Rwasa, Burundi’s leading opposition leader and head of CNL, told The EastAfrican: “They ignored Article 50 of the EAC treaty. The Eala nomination should be redone because our party, CNL, sent two names but the ruling CNDD-FDD added a third, that of Kathy Kezimana, and which is the one approved yet we didn’t front it.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf the pre-selected candidates to fill Burundi’s nine slots in Eala, six are from the ruling party CNDD-FDD, one from CNL, one from UPRONA and a representative of the minority ethnic group Twa.\n\nThe final list for CNDD-FDD has Joseph Ntakirutimana (current party deputy secretary general), Gabriel Ntisezerana (former VP), Victor Burikukiye, Saidi Kibeya, Jean Marie Muhirwa and Mo-mamo Karerwa.\n\nCNL got Kathy Kezimana despite not being her party’s candidate. UPRONA will be represented by Olivier Nkurunziza and Goreth Bigirimana will represent the Twa.\n\nBurundi is also expected to take speakership of the 5th Assembly, replacing Rwanda’s Martin Ngoga who is completing his term later this year. But Gitega is expected to face competition with sources in Arusha telling The EastAfrican that South Sudan will front a candidate.\n\nUganda boycott\n\nIn Uganda, a parliamentary verification committee on Thursday presented to parliament 28 nominees for the country’s nine slots even as opposition groups boycotted the process.\n\nThe 28, a number of them independents, will be on the ballot on September 29, when parliament votes.\n\nBut the biggest opposition party in the House, the National Unity Platform (NUP), has snubbed the process, accusing the ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM) of misusing its numerical strength to shortchange other political parties and meddling in the nomination of their representatives.\n\nIt is highly anticipated that the NRM will get six slots, leaving two slots for the opposition and one for independents.\n\nTraditionally, for either opposition or independents to win, they need the blessings of the ruling NRM – basically President Yoweri Museveni – because the final voting is done by all MPs and NRM has the numbers in parliament.\n\nThe NRM central executive committee chaired by President Museveni resolved to return all its six previous Eala members for another term because “they have performed very well so far.”\n\nThis did not sit well with the leader of opposition, Mathias Mpuuga, of NUP.\n\n“For some reason without a formula, the NRM believes that it is entitled to six members at Eala, and that that entitlement is eternal; as if the six are ordained and that others should look at them in admiration,” Mpuuga said.\n\n“NUP is not going to be part of this ritual. It is only going to be part of an election where the rules of the game are respected, where multi-party dispensation is upheld.”",

This point was supported by ASKA Group President Kamaal Samji, who mentioned the presence of steam in the ground in places like Kasese.\n\nEnergy Ministry Permanent Secretary Eng. Irene Batebe noted that ASKA will be expected to conduct feasibility studies as part of the project. The work will also include securing the required licenses and permits. However, Batebe assured that the Ministry will help in supporting this process by providing all the necessary information or facilitating the authorization process if needed.\n\nDuring the meeting between ASKA Group and the Ministry, Okaasai mentioned that power generation companies in Uganda can now independently generate, transmit, and distribute power to the end-user. This makes investments in the country’s power sector attractive while also empowering the population who rely on power to have stable and sustainable livelihoods.\n\nThe project is also expected to generate jobs for Ugandans. East Africa Project Liaison Salim Janmohamed assured the Minister that there will only be a maximum of 10 experts involved in the project and the rest of the employees will be locally hired and trained to meet international standards.\n\n“As climate is changing, we need to take a proactive role to diversify to clean energy. The project will provide clean energy for Uganda,” said ASKA Group CEO Dinu Samji, further stating that the project is in line with the global transition towards clean energy.\n\nSource: Uganda Update",
    "Ebola Disease caused by Sudan virus - Uganda": "Outbreak at a glance\n\nOn 20 September 2022, Uganda health authorities declared an outbreak of Ebola disease, caused by Sudan virus, following laboratory confirmation of a patient from a village in Madudu sub-county, Mubende district, central Uganda.\n\nAs of 25 September 2022, a cumulative number of 18 confirmed and 18 probable cases have been reported from Mubende, Kyegegwa and Kassanda districts, including 23 deaths, of which five were among confirmed cases (CFR among confirmed cases 28%). This is the first Ebola disease outbreak caused by Sudan virus (SUDV) in Uganda since 2012.\n\nDescription of the outbreak\n\nOn 20 September 2022, the health authorities in Uganda declared an outbreak of Ebola disease caused by Sudan virus (SUDV), after a case was confirmed in a village of Madudu sub-county in Mubende district, central Uganda.\n\nThe case was a 24-year-old male who developed a wide range of symptoms on 11 September including high-grade fever, tonic convulsions, blood-stained vomit and diarrhoea, loss of appetite, pain while swallowing, chest pain, dry cough and bleeding in the eyes. He visited two private clinics, successively between 11-13 and 13-15 September without improvement. He was then referred to the Regional Referral Hospital (RRH) on 15 September where he was isolated as a suspected case of viral haemorrhagic fever. A blood sample was collected on 17 September and sent to the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) in Kampala where RT- PCR tests conducted were positive for SUDV on 19 September. On the same day, the patient died.\n\nResults of preliminary investigations identified a number of community deaths from an unknown illness in Madudu and Kiruma sub-counties of Mubende district reported in the first two weeks of September. These deaths are now considered to be probable cases of Ebola caused by SUDV.\n\nAs of 25 September 2022, a cumulative number of 36 cases (18 confirmed and 18 probable cases) have been reported from Mubende (14 confirmed and 18 probable), Kyegegwa (three confirmed cases) and Kassanda (one confirmed case) districts. Twenty-three deaths have been recorded, of which five were among confirmed cases (CFR among confirmed cases 28%). Of the total confirmed and suspected cases, 62% are female and 38% are male. There are currently 13 confirmed cases hospitalized. The median age of the cases is 26 years (range 1 year to 60 years). A cumulative number of 223 contacts have been listed.\n\nEpidemiology of the disease\n\nAccording to the International Classification of Disease for filoviruses (ICD-11) released in May 2019, Ebola disease is now sub-categorized depending on the causative virus. Outbreaks of Ebola disease caused by Sudan virus are named Sudan Virus Disease (SVD) outbreaks. Prior to May 2019 all viruses causing Ebola disease were grouped together. Based on the results of laboratory tests, this outbreak is caused by Sudan virus.\n\nSudan virus disease is a severe, often fatal illness affecting humans. Sudan virus was first reported in southern Sudan in June 1976, since then the virus has emerged periodically and up to now, seven outbreaks caused by SUDV have been reported, four in Uganda and three in Sudan. The estimated case fatality ratios of SVD have varied from 41% to 100% in past outbreaks.\n\nThe virus is introduced into the human population through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals such as fruit bats, chimpanzees, gorillas, monkeys, forest antelope or porcupines found ill or dead or in the rainforest. The virus then spreads through human-to-human transmission via direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with either blood or body fluids of a person who is sick with or has died from SVD or objects that have been contaminated with body fluids (like blood, faeces, vomit) from a person sick with SVD or the body of a person who died from SVD.\n\nThe incubation period ranges from 2 to 21 days. People infected with Sudan virus cannot spread the disease until they develop symptoms, and they remain infectious as long as their blood contains the virus. Symptoms of SVD can be sudden and include fever, fatigue, muscle pain, headache, and sore throat later followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, symptoms of impaired kidney and liver function. In some cases, the patient might present both internal and external bleeding (for example, bleeding from the gums, or blood in the stools).\n\nThe diagnosis of SVD can be difficult, as early nonspecific manifestation of the disease may mimic other infectious diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever and meningitis. Confirmation is made using numerous diagnostic methods including RT-PCR. Supportive care - rehydration with oral or intravenous fluids - and treatment of specific symptoms improve survival.\n\nThere are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of Sudan virus disease.\n\nUganda has reported four SVD outbreaks, in 2000, 2011 and 2012 (two outbreaks). Uganda also reported a Bundibugyo virus disease outbreak in 2007 and an Ebola virus disease outbreak in 2019.\n\nPublic health response\n\nCoordination\n\nThe Ministry of Health (MOH) established a National Task Force, with WHO providing technical support\n\nThe Incidence Management Team was activated both within the MOH and the WHO country office\n\nThe MOH Incident Commander has been deployed to Mubende District to support response efforts in the affected region\n\nWHO is supporting the orientation of the leadership at the Regional Referral Hospital and the district health team on early identification and case management\n\nA response plan is being developed and priority actions have been identified\n\nSurveillance and Laboratory\n\nWHO has supported the activation of surveillance structures in districts\n\nContact tracing and active case finding are ongoing\n\nWHO has deployed a technical team in Mubende district to support surveillance\n\nCase Management\n\nWHO has supported the assessment of the isolation unit at the regional referral Hospital and dispatched an Ebola disease kit and tent for the isolation of patients\n\nWHO has deployed a central team of experts to support the establishment of a treatment unit in the Regional Referral Hospital\n\nInfection prevention and control (IPC) teams were deployed to support capacity building of health workers in IPC and the establishment of screening and triage at all health facilities in affected districts\n\nCommunication and Risk Communication\n\nAs part of the communication and risk communication activities, WHO provided technical support for the organization of the press conference on Ebola and the development and dissemination of a press statement by the Ministry of Health\n\nCurrently, WHO is supporting the review of Information, Education and Communication (IEC) material for dissemination to the public\n\nWHO risk assessment\n\nUganda has experience in responding to Ebola virus disease and Sudan virus disease outbreaks, and necessary action has been initiated quickly. The current outbreak is the first Ebola disease outbreak caused by Sudan virus in Uganda since 2012.\n\nIn the absence of licensed vaccines and therapeutics for prevention and treatment of Sudan virus disease, the risk of potential serious public health impact is high. Community deaths and care of patients in private facilities and hospitals and other community health services with limited protection and infection prevention and control measures entail a high risk of many transmission chains. Investigations are ongoing to determine the scope of the outbreak and the possibility of spreading to other districts. Importation of cases to neighbouring countries cannot be ruled out at this stage.\n\nAccording to the information currently available, the overall risk has been assessed as high at national level considering: (i) the confirmed Sudan virus and the lack of an authorized vaccine (ii) the possibility that the event started three weeks before the identification of the index case and several transmission chains have not been not tracked; (iii) patients presented at various facilities with suboptimal infection, prevention and control (IPC) practices including inadequate use of personal protective equipment (PPE); the patients died and were traditionally buried with large gathering ceremonies; (iv) although the country has developed an increased capacity to respond to Ebola outbreaks over recent years, and has a local capacity that can be easily mobilized and organised with available resources to mount a robust response, the system could be overwhelmed if the number of cases increases and the outbreak spreads to other sub-counties, districts and regions, as the country simultaneously responds to multiple emergencies, including anthrax, COVID-19, Rift Valley fever and Yellow fever, as well as flooding and prevailing food insecurity.\n\nIn addition, the outbreak was detected among individuals living around an active local gold mine. Mobility among traders of this commodity is likely to be high, and the declaration of the outbreak may cause some miners already incubating the disease to flee.\n\nThe currently affected Mubende district has no international borders. Nevertheless, the risk of international spread cannot be ruled out due to the active cross-border population movement. In addition, investigations are ongoing to establish transmission chains and the scope of the outbreak is yet to be determined.\n\nAt Regional and Global levels, the overall risk has been assessed as low.\n\nWHO advice\n\nEffective outbreak control relies on applying a package of interventions, including case management, surveillance and contact tracing, an optimal laboratory service, implementation of infection prevention and control measures in health care and community settings, safe and dignified burials and community engagement and social mobilization. Community engagement is essential to successfully controlling outbreaks. Raising awareness of risk factors for Ebola infection and protective measures that individuals can take is an effective way to reduce human transmission.\n\nEarly initiation of supportive treatment has been shown to significantly reduce deaths from Ebola disease. There is a need to strengthen surveillance and other response activities to contain the possibility of exponential spread.\n\nBased on available evidence the ERVEBO vaccine — used in the recent responses against the Ebola virus disease outbreaks — will not provide cross-protection against the Sudan virus disease.\n\nThe Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) vaccine called Zabdeno/Mvabea against Ebola has only been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) against Ebola virus disease and has not been tested against Sudan virus disease. This vaccine is administered on a two-dose schedule and requires 56 days between the two doses. The first dose provides protection against the Zaire ebolavirus and the second dose was designed to provide protection against other species of the virus, including Sudan. However, this multiantigen protection has not been demonstrated with clinical data. Even if the vaccine was tested and proved to be effective against Sudan ebolavirus, it would only provide protection some days after the second dose is administered. This means the vaccine is not appropriate for outbreak response.\n\nWHO advises against any restrictions on travel and/or trade to Uganda based on available information for the current outbreak.\n\nFurther information\n\nCitable reference: World Health Organization (26 September 2022).

    "Uganda: Farmers switch to organic fertilizers as price of chemical hikes": "As is customary, Joseph Wagodoma is on his way to his patch of land in Kayunga, central Uganda. If the farmer and his wife are used to tending their bean garden, somehting has changed for the couple. In the past few months, the yhave switched to organic fertilizers. Like many food producers, they are hit by global shortage in crop fertilizers caused by sanctions on Russia, bad weather and cuts in export.\n\n\"What inspired me to turn to organic fertilizer was the price of chemical fertilizer, Wagodoma says. I had no other source of money to continue with it. The small harvests we were getting would only cater for basic household needs, so by the start of the planting season, you have no money for fertilizers to prepare your garden with.\"\n\nAbout 15 km away from Joseph's farm, workers are collecting a organic waste delivery in a Kampala warehouse. The Marula Proteen company spearheads the organic fertilizer initiative.\n\nThe company's CEO and founder Tommie Hooft explains how the process works: \"We shred all the waste we ferment it in drums and the fermentation makes the waste soft and then the soft waste is fed to our maggots for a period of 7 to 8 days. The maggots that eat it their enzymes consume it they are breaking down all the waste. and in the essence the larva poo is the fertilizer and it is similar to what happens in nature, in nature some thing dies and it rots and it gets eaten by maggots and then it goes into the soil, so that's the process we are mimicking.\"\n\nA rapidly scaling project\n\nWhen the idea of ProTeen was born in late 2017 in the brains of the CEO and his advisor Ludivine Berouard, they were preoccupied by the animal feed and sustainability challenges Ugandan farmers faced.\n\nThey discovered that \"poultry farmers [were] no longer able to access fishmeal, their primary source of poultry feed\" because of \"overfishing in Lake Victoria which [had led] to reduced availability, high cost and low quality of fishmeal\".\n\nAccording to Food and Agriculture Organization, Russia stood as the world’s top exporter of nitrogen fertilizers, the second leading supplier of potassium fertilizers and the third largest exporter of phosphorous fertilizers. The consequences of the Russia-Ukraine conflict have turned the tables and ProTeen's mission has become more necessary as ever.\n\n\"30 to 40 % of the total chemical fertilizer available isn't there anymore and Europe needs it, Brazil needs it, the U.S. needs it, Tommie Hooft says. It is going to places other than Uganda other than Africa. So in our case we don't just have the opportunity to sell organic fertilizer we also have an opportunity to teach farmers how to use organic and start managing their farms in a more organic way.\"\n\nMarula Proteen has also partenered with residents who farm the short-lived but fertile insect. The company provides farmers with 5-day-old larvae that they rear to generate their own fertilizers.\n\nMuhammad Magezi a worker with Marula Proteen, says since the introduction of the black soldier fly initiative, farming communities are rushing to adopt the method. \"We are receiving a lot of positive feedback from our farmers because in the beginning before the introduction of this technology they used to use synthetic fertilizers which are more expensive on market and BSF black soldier fly rearing provides a cheaper alternative\", Magezi reveals.\n\nMarula Proteen prides itseft of providing a clean and safe fertilizer which can improve the soil.\n\nLarvae farming programs exist in countries including Nigeria and Kenya.",

    "Unlocking press freedom in Uganda: What must be done": "In 2018, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) global press freedom index placed Uganda 125th out of 180 nations—a grim rank the country held for three consecutive years.\n\nBy 2022, the East African nation of more than 44 million people had nosedived seven places as practitioners in Uganda’s fourth pillar of democracy continued to be threatened with a record overt and covert forms of repression from State actors.\n\nNow, the nation’s status of independent journalism falls far away from RSF’s description of free press. RSF defines media freedom as “the effective possibility for journalists, as individuals and as groups, to select, produce and disseminate news and information in the public interest, independently from political, economic, legal and social interference, and without threats to their physical and mental safety.”\n\nReturn to democratic path\n\nWith Uganda’s media freedom shrinking, her journalism has found a grim position contrary to the suggestion of Marxist philosopher Antonio Gramsci, who postulates that “history teaches, but has no pupils.”\n\nIn this case, a pupil of Uganda’s media historiography, fourth-year journalism and communication student at Makerere University, Ms Belinda Birungi, is “extremely scared to go missing once admitted into media practice.”\n\n“I am fearful of police and army brutality. Besides, they’re many grey areas in our Constitution that can be used against you,” says the 22-year-old Ugandan.\n\nEndless crackdowns on media houses have subdued the likes of Ms Birungi to self-censorship.\n\n“Security forces have snatched our courage to present the wrongs of society… I mean the courage to write objectively,” said Ms Birungi, who was interning at the country’s leading independent newspaper, Daily Monitor, at the time of this publication.\n\nBetween coming to terms with a brutal state capture of the media and surviving, Ms Birungi “prefers other things to becoming part of over 40 journalists killed globally every year.”\n\nIn reply to Ms Birungi’s concerns, the head of postgraduate journalism studies at Uganda Christian University (UCU), Ms Annette Kezaabu, underscores that “harassment and criminal sanctions are dangerous to journalism.”\n\nShe adds that one way of dealing with this is to ensure “cases of journalists should be handled as civil wrongs like in most liberal societies.”\n\nAlthough enshrined under Articles 29 and 41 of the Ugandan Constitution, repeated violation of press freedoms, profoundly by security forces, has raised questions over what appears to be a crisis of legitimacy.\n\nBut Kezaabu, who also leads the Uganda Pornography Control Committee at the Ethics and Integrity Ministry, says “the laws in place are sufficient and don’t require a constitutional rewrite.”\n\n“We should use the laws to tighten where security has made inroads, but there are things that we don’t talk about that are maybe an error of compromised journalists,” she says, adding, “Journalists must abide by accepted ethos for their freedom’s sake.”\n\nKezaabu, however, admits that interpretation or application of the law against journalists may be one-sided to suit the wishes of its enforcers or the jury.\n\n“There’s need to return the country to a democratic path to safeguard human freedom, including the one of expression,” she urges.\n\nFurther, Kezaabu acknowledges that use of anti-terrorism laws and a litany of other decrees against free speech are a clear loop of claw-back clauses in the Constitution.\n\n“It is incumbent upon media houses and journalists to know when not to overstep their mandate to avoid clashing with authorities by, for instance, promoting nudity,” she advises.\n\nArriving at a similar argument, Aga Khan University School of Media and Communications graduate lecturer Alex Taremwa “believes without social responsibility to audiences, the media lose the values that make their duty to society important.”\n\nMr Taremwa argues that breaching the universally known media mandate and standards may instantly birth the horrors that have defined the industry in the eyes of individuals like Ms Birungi.\n\nNew business models\n\nOne of the other challenges press freedom in Uganda faces is that there are more than 200 radio stations and more than 30 televisions in Uganda. The number is impressive. At least superficially. Nearly 70 percent of these stations are, however, owned by either deep state or legislators, according to an African Centre for Media Excellence 2022 survey.\n\n“They control the broadcast narrative and that breaks journalism’s will to mirror society,” observes 2019 BBC Komla Dumar award-winning investigative journalist Solomon Sserwanja.\n\nTo evade the proprietor censorship oriented by political and commercial interests, Mr Sserwanja moots alternative business models to run media operations.\n\n“…for instance, media houses can go after full subscription and run away from advertisers whose commercial advertising interests may force media houses to filter serious stories,” he told this publication on September 6.\n\nFair pay for journalists\n\nThe ability for journalists to report freely is also hampered, for many reasons, by the poor pay journalists are given. In Uganda, pay cheques of journalists have steadied below $200 (about Shs760,000) per month amid lack of newsroom investment by media moguls.\n\nAt least each senior editor contacted from five different (both) state and private media houses reasons that “equipping reporters is an essentiality for free press in a digital evolution.”\n\nFor 25-year-old Soft Power News journalist and digital assistant Muhamadi Byemboijana, “press freedom starts internally with employers ensuring fair pay for journalists.”\n\nHe adds: “Some press corps are battered because the tormentors have no respect for their low paying profession.”\n\nIn addition to that, because of the poor pay, many journalists will take bribes to manage the cost of living. A Ugandan journalist, who preferred anonymity, on September 7 confessed to accepting a “small bribe to kill a story.”\n\n“I killed a match fixing story involving the national cricket team because I felt unprotected, including by the media house I work for. Eventually, I accepted pay from the sports fixers,” the television sports scribe said in an interview.\n\nThis is why fair pay, although it might be a difficult subject to talk about, must be looked into to allow journalists do their work well. Mr Taremwa, in agreement of this, states that “like any other [human] right, good pay definitely increases the quality of freedom-enjoyment and eliminates the threat of bribery or blackmail, which endangers one’s journalistic autonomy.”\n\nCivic engagement\n\nAnother challenge to press freedom is the fact that the audiences for whom they write may not be critically aware of the role of the media.\n\nOver the last two decades, several media houses have emerged in almost all Ugandan regions—usually with screaming headlines critical of the State, signalling the possibility that media freedom has made some gains to be preserved.\n\nHowever, by 2013, an absolute militaristic approach under the Museveni presidency had outpaced his classical conservative National Resistance Army (NRA) post-guerilla war promise of a “free press” in 1986.\n\n“The public cannot say it enjoys freedom if information is being hidden from them. To move our press freedom higher than like 65 percent, awareness should be created in the public domain regarding the fundamental importance of journalism,” Kezaabu says.\n\nTo protect what he describes as his endangered freedom on duty, Mbale City-based Step FM talk show host Eric Mwasame, 30, wants “journalism recognised as a fundamental pillar of development.”\n\n“Society, especially politicians, take us as people who fight governments or mere antagonists, which is untrue. That should change,” Mr Mwasame says.\n\nSimilarly, Kampala City resident Peninah Rukundo singles out “civic engagement as a crucial enabler of free speech.”\n\nWhile the challenges to press freedom remain, some of these solutions can begin to pave the way for a media that is able to do its job robustly, which in turn provides the nation a good service.\n\nForming associations\n\nFor many professions, associations help push their agenda and enable them to have a listening ear from the powers that be. In the case of the media, however, a tiny sliver of Uganda’s hundreds of journalists subscribe to press associations that largely exist only in name in a complex political environment. This has discouraged many from joining them.\n\n“I want to know what these associations are doing for journalism by their actions and then I’d join them,” freelance journalist Daniel Emukule, 39, reacts when asked why he’s not conformist to any press association.\n\nWorryingly also, the near absence of Fourth Estate unions—as tens of journalists are continuously persecuted—has compelled at least eight out of 10 reporters interviewed by this newspaper on September 7 to describe existing press associations as “state-linked and inoperative.”\n\nForming strong and respected media unions and, or associations would, therefore, provide much needed support.\n\n“In areas where relative press freedom exists, working associations are vocal against injustices targeting journalists and that’s why vibrant ones are essential for press freedom,” the head of postgraduate journalism studies at Uganda Christian University (UCU), Ms Annette Kezaabu, emphasises.\n\nMr Sserwanja, 35, who left his job at a top media house in Uganda to become chief executive officer at the African Institute for Investigative Journalism (AIIJ), holds that the country needs more such establishments that protect threatened media practitioners.\n\n“All of us (stakeholders) have a role to play to better journalism in this country. The future of journalism relies on collaborations by entities that lead conversations against media repression,” he says.",
    "Uganda on alert as malaria cases and deaths rise": "By JONATHAN KAMOGA More by this Author\n\nA resurgence of malaria cases and deaths in Uganda is worrying the medical fraternity amid reported shortage of medicines.\n\nAccording to Jimmy Opigo, the programme manager for malaria control at the Ministry of Health, preliminary findings point to a drop in usage of mosquito nets, mutation of the malaria parasite and increase in drug resistance.\n\n“We are also studying whether Covid-19 could have had some impact,” Dr Opigo said.\n\nSome private and public hospitals in high risk districts are reporting an increase in the number of malaria patients seeking treatment in the facilities, health workers said.\n\n“Most of the inpatients at our facility are malaria patients although we have many outpatients coming in daily. Most of the drugs we have been stocking for the bigger part of this year are malaria drugs,” said Annet Nsole, a lab technician at Kasana Health Centre in Luweero district.\n\nAccording to August data from the Ministry of Health, about 46 districts across the country are currently experiencing a surge in the number of new malaria infections.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We have made some progress. We had over 70 districts, and we are now down to 40. But it’s still one third of the country, and that is really high,” Dr Opigo said.\n\nIn the last two weeks of August, the country registered 199,695 new cases with 35 deaths. Since the peak of the upsurge in January, the average number of bi-weekly new infections stood between 200,000 and 250,000.\n\nThis year’s figures are higher than last year’s average of between 100,000 and 120,000 new bi-weekly infections, Health ministry’s data shows.\n\nThe ministry has reported that about 23 percent of districts lack enough Artemisinin-based combination therapy stocks for treatment of patients.\n\nIncreased supplies\n\n“This is mostly because of logistical constraints. But currently as government, we are increasing supplies in terms of medicine and mosquito nets in high risk areas. In some others, we are spraying. We are now enhancing case investigation and running media campaigns to create awareness within the population,” Dr Opigo said.\n\nBut most of these interventions have been constrained by limited funds.\n\nAccording to Dr Opigo, the Health ministry spends about $140 million annually in the fight against malaria but the current upsurge has created a funding gap. Recently, the ministry secured $14 million from the Global Fund to help them finance the current upsurge, but officials say more funding is still needed.\n\n“We run long-term grants of about three to four years so what we did was to call forward the money for 2023 to help us increase medicine supply mostly. We are sourcing for more so we can be able to fill the gaps created by the increasing consumption arising from the upsurge,” Dr Opigo said.",

Refugees are provided with plots of land for housing and cultivation. Refugees and host communities access the same health facilities, and their children attend schools together.\n\nImportant gains in refugee self-reliance and economic inclusion are now at risk due to severe underfunding for UNHCR's operations in the country.\n\nBy the end of August, UNHCR had received just 38 per cent of its 2022 funding requirement of US$343.4 million to respond to the needs of refugees in Uganda, as determined at the start of this year.\n\nThe funding gap has strained UNHCR's capacity to provide critical support, including basic humanitarian assistance, child protection services, civil registration, and livelihood opportunities.\n\nRefugees are seeing a sharp reduction in support for income-generating activities, including for agricultural inputs that are critical to cultivating allocated land.\n\nChildren, especially girls, face a high risk of dropping out of school as UNHCR will be unable to pay teachers’ salaries, and already crowded classrooms will increase in size. With no more funding to procure soap and hygiene kits for women and girls, their health and access to education will be negatively affected. UNHCR cannot afford to purchase new stocks of medicines for health centres, while progress in reducing child and maternal mortality will regress, and infant malnutrition will increase.\n\nUNHCR and its partners need urgent financial contributions to meet the urgent needs of new refugee arrivals in Uganda, to upgrade the reception capacity and basic infrastructure of refugee settlements and prioritize the relocation of refugees to more suitable facilities.\n\nKisoro, in southwest Uganda, has received most new arrivals from the DRC. At the Nyakabande transit centre, refugees – overwhelmingly women and children – face substandard and crowded conditions which expose them to risks, including gender-based violence.\n\nFor more information on this topic, please contact:",

    "Uganda's growing mountain of debt: How long will the crisis be postponed?": "By JOACHIM BUWEMBO More by this Author\n\nUganda’s parliamentary committee on the economy last week released a frightening report about the country’s debt situation. Now at $21 billion, the public debt is about three times the government’s total annual revenue collection. Even the politicians are worried.\n\nLike some of our neighbours, the debt has surpassed the 50 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) mark, raising questions about our capacity to pay.\n\nBecause of the high cost of doing business, return on investment is low and many bank loans do not perform well. So commercial banks hate lending to customers and prefer buying government papers with long-term bonds yielding a lucrative 17 per cent.\n\nBanks apparently discourage customers from borrowing by charging them a whopping 20 per cent annual interest which is twice or thrice the inflation rate, plus loan arrangement fees, plus fees of the accountant acceptable to the bank for compiling your cash flow, plus paying for the bank’s insurance of the risk they are taking despite its holding your security hostage, plus lawyer’s mortgage management fees or whatever your bank calls it, plus other charges for which there is no space here to list.\n\nThe central bank has for some years tried to limit the Treasury bills and bonds available to the commercial banks, but the government is addicted to domestic borrowing like a juvenile hooked on narcotics who cheaply sells any movable family valuables to buy his fix for the moment. It keeps issuing those papers to service loans — digging one hole to fill another and may the future take care of itself.\n\nIt works for America; it doesn’t work for Africa\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe hate the Western lenders for lecturing us about “unrelated” matters like democracy and human rights as they lend us their money. We praise the Chinese for “respecting us” and not preaching to us.\n\nBut the comrades from Beijing don’t lend us from the Treasury otherwise we would invoke our solidarity and default. They get their banks to lend us at commercial rates and shorter grace periods, unlike the World Bank “lecturers” who charge less than one percent interest and give long grace periods. There is no free lunch in the borrower’s life.\n\nAlthough much of the borrowing is for infrastructure development, which is a good thing, the debt is also growing by that vague item called budget support.\n\nThe Inspector General of Government is soon losing her voice for endlessly telling us of trillions stolen from public coffers, and the “budget support” loans are also in the pot from which the stealing is done, since it is not earmarked for any project and therefore is not subject to the lenders’ monitoring.\n\nThe amounts stolen exceed the amounts borrowed for development. So if stealing can be limited, the need for borrowing would reduce.\n\nWe could choose to live with a growing public debt and let our grandchildren face the consequences, but it is not stopping at the government level. Ugandans can be reckless borrowers.\n\nMaybe other countries also borrow, especially those with credit cards and mortgage cultures. But their interest rates are not as crazy as ours.\n\nWe blame our government for reckless borrowing but the individuals who make up the nation aren’t any different. When banks demand stiff interest, our people run to the loan shark who charge 10 percent per month!\n\nTheir best ally is Uganda Prison Services, for when you default, they cart you off to jail for six months. If there is a wannabe big spender that you haven’t seen in Kampala for a while, check Luzira Prisons — fellow could be there.\n\nPrison management has been complaining of congestion, thanks to defaulters filling civil jails. For these days some borrow without any intention of paying. When the lender fails to collect and calls in the enforcers, the borrower goes to prison secretly laughing.\n\nApparently, there is peace like that of the dead in prison. There, creditors cannot bother you with phone calls and threats. And apparently after serving your six months, being compelled to pay becomes very hard, especially if you concealed the proceeds of the loan well.\n\nSo there we are, and how we arrived here is not the question, but how we get out. The government, banks, money lenders and the people are all addicted to the game.\n\nWill something give way? How long can the crisis be postponed?\n\nJoachim Buwembo is a Kampala-based journalist.

    "Uganda MPs should take on boda riders as they did with Nyege Nyege": "By JOACHIM BUWEMBO More by this Author\n\nUganda is a nation of the highest moral standards, no wonder we gave the (Catholic) Church its largest harvest of saints in one episode — 22 of them, now known as the Uganda Martyrs! Since 1969, every Pope reigning at The Vatican feels duty bound to make a pilgrimage to Kampala, at a place called Namugongo where they were burnt to death for refusing to compromise on their morality.\n\nIt is therefore not surprising that our parliamentarians have been up in arms against the Executive over a festival deemed immoral and called Nyege Nyege — what an immoral sounding name that provokes feelings of gyration — that used to be held annually in Jinja, 80 kilometres east of Kampala, before the Covid-19 interruption.\n\nHow do people dare think of coming from different countries to perform immoral dances in this highly moral land of ours!\n\nMuch as we don’t tolerate immoral dances, we are a very forgiving society. That is why although the lodges of Kampala fill up at lunchtime, their short-term clients who return home from work promptly at five wearing pious faces and sounding like gospel preachers as they greet their husbands and wives occupy front pews in our churches, playing key roles in the worship sessions, because it also part of morality to forgive.\n\nThat is why blatant robbers of public funds are also major donors to church projects, because generosity is a virtue in highly moralistic societies like ours.\n\nHow then can anyone think we can tolerate fellows who want to contaminate our pure land by bringing musicians and dancers, splashing money while hiding in a thickly vegetated arena at the source of the Nile and spend four days doing immoral things?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn that first week of September, however, there was a major development in the capital city of Kampala, which is directly run by the central government, which ought to have preoccupied our national legislators more than what paying adults were doing in Jinja, which a city with its own city council, inside a district which also has a district council.\n\nIn Kampala, for the first time in living memory, mass public transport was being revived, with two bus companies being licensed to operate on two key city routes.\n\nThe revival of mass transport was, however, running into obstacles which should have concerned national legislators more than events of paying adults hidden far away. The sleek, modern but innocent buses were being beaten by angry matatu touts and conductors, their crime being that they are so clean and lovely, offering Ugandans an opportunity to travel decently in their city.\n\nAs the week wore on, the smart new bus operators enlisted the hostile touts to also call passengers for them, for a fee.\n\nRealising that the buses were offering them an opportunity and not removing them from work, the touts became cooperative.\n\nBut then the local authorities have not moved fast enough to enable mass transport to operate smoothly, by way of designating lanes for the buses.\n\nSo boarding the sleek, zero-emission electric, soundless buses does not necessarily save you from the traffic jam, though you can enjoy free wi-fi and air-con while on board. Such are the matters that should have engaged the nation more than Nyege Nyege.\n\nMenace\n\nCaning poor young buses by touts aside, the MPs should address the boda boda menace with the same vigour as they did Nyege Nyege.\n\nToday, 14 Ugandans are being killed on the roads daily, half of them being passengers or riders on boda boda. Most hospital beds are now occupied by boda boda crash victims, at the expense of other ailments.\n\nPrevious attempts to register boda boda and institute some form of regulated operating environment for them have failed.\n\nRecently a for-pay training programme was started for them but the boda boda riders have scoffed at it, claiming it is just a money making plot for some connected people, and that the certificate one gets after attending it does not mean anything to the traffic and statutory registration authorities.\n\nSuch matters, though directly linked to several deaths a day, are not deemed as important and worth of more urgent parliamentary attention as a four-day picnic for paying adults in some forest by the riverside.\n\nJoachim Buwembo is a Kampala-based journalist.

    "Uganda and Rwanda resume talks to revive bilateral ties": "By Ange Iliza More by this Author\n\nRwanda and Uganda have officially resumed diplomatic talks, a significant step towards reviving relations between the two countries that were at loggerheads for almost three years till the beginning of this year.\n\nA delegation of Ugandan officials led by the Foreign Affairs Minister Odongo Jeje Abubakhar held talks with their Rwandan counterparts on Thursday in Kigali.\n\nThe team, which included Foreign PS Bagiire Vincent Waiswa and acting Director of Regional and International Political Affairs Arthur Kafeero, had arrived in Rwanda a day earlier.\n\nRecently appointed Ugandan High Commissioner to Rwanda Robert Rusoke was also in the talks with the Rwandan team led by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Vincent Biruta.\n\nIn a joint statement released after the meeting on Thursday, the countries said the diplomatic and political consultations are a continuation of the commitment of the heads of State to deepen further and strengthen the cordial relations between the two countries.\n\n“The ministers exchanged views on regional matters relating to security, trade, investment, and strategic regional projects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“They agreed to review and revive bilateral cooperation in the different areas of interest by convening the next Joint Permanent Commission between Rwanda and Uganda,” the statement reads.\n\nRwanda will host the meeting slated for March 2023.\n\nUgandan products\n\nRwanda and Uganda have been working on reviving relations since early this year with official visits to each other countries, including President Paul Kagame’s visit to Kampala in April and Yoweri Museveni’s trip to Kigali in June during the Commonwealth summit.\n\nIsmael Buchanan, a Kigali-based political analyst and lecturer of International Relations at the University of Rwanda, says reviving bilateral trade should be a priority.\n\n“There has been tremendous progress made in Rwanda and Uganda relations this year. The constant visit by officials is key because there are still issues that need to be addressed, including trade. There is hope, but we are yet to see Ugandan products on Rwanda’s market as we used to,” he said.\n\nRead: Ugandan manufacturers push for return to Rwandan market\n\nRelations between the two neighbouring countries deteriorated in 2018 when Kigali accused Kampala of harbouring groups hostile to it and torturing innocent Rwandans on its soil. The heightened tensions saw Rwanda close its common border with Uganda.\n\nThe two countries have since held several talks to normalise relations, and the border was reopened in February.\n\nRead: Uganda deports top Rwandan rebel\n\nHowever, trade has not picked up as expected.\n\nUganda’s exports to Rwanda hit a low of $2 million in 2020 at the peak of hostilities between the two countries, from a high of more than $200 million before the closure of the border.",
    "Uganda to introduce fines for internet misuse": "By JONATHAN KAMOGA More by this Author\n\nMisuse of internet in Uganda will now attract hefty fines and longer jail terms, following amendments on the Computer Misuse Act 2011 that were passed last week.\n\nThe amendments, now awaiting the president’s signature to become law, seek to enhance the provisions on unauthorised access to information or data, prohibit the sharing of any information relating to a child without authorisation from a parent or guardian, and to prohibit the sending or sharing of information that promotes hate speech.\n\nAccording to the new law, one will face a fine of Ush16 million ($4,200) or face 10 years in jail, or both, for unauthorised sharing of people’s data.\n\nEqually offensive will be information shared to ridicule others. Any misleading or malicious information about or relating to any person through a computer and offenders could face up to seven years in jail.\n\nThe provisions have caused an uproar, with opponents claiming that it they would take away their right to access information.\n\nMathias Mpuuga, the leader of the opposition in parliament, said that the new law would be challenged in the Constitutional Court on the grounds that it is inconsistent with some provisions of the law on the rights of the citizens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the debate on the Bill, MPs only rejected the clause that sought to bar convicts from holding public office or running for elections in 10 years.\n\nGorreth Namugga, the Mawogola South representative who read the minority report on the Bill, had earlier urged the House not to pass the proposed law since many of the clauses are already catered for in existing legislations and in some instances, go against the country’s Constitution.\n\nThe current act has been used by police to arrest critics and online trolls who post about the first family and other government officials.",

They also demand an end to all forced transfers of children, as well as any inter-country adoptions of children transferred from within Ukraine’s internationally recognised borders.\n\nWhile noting that a forcible transfer is a war crime and a potential crime against humanity, MEPs demand the Russian government repeals all legislation facilitating the adoption of Ukrainian children.\n\nThe text was adopted by show of hands.

They ask authorities to adequately compensate people for lost property and land. Parliament also demands the Ugandan authorities allow unhindered access to the zone covered by the project for civil society organizations, independent journalists, international observers and investigative researchers.\n\nRelatedly, MEPs urge TotalEnergies to study the feasibility of an alternative route for the project to better protect sensitive ecosystems and the water resources of Uganda and Tanzania, and limit the impact on the watersheds in the African Great Lakes region.\n\nParliament also expresses its concern about the growing economic influence of China and Russia, in particular in the energy sector; and in this regard is concerned by the interest of Uganda’s authorities in developing a nuclear power plant with Russian assistance.\n\nThe resolution was adopted by show of hands.

MEPs point in particular to the arbitrary arrest of Bishop Rolando Álvarez, and call for his and others’ immediate and unconditional release and the annulment of all legal proceedings against them.\n\nNicaragua’s judicial system lacks independence, according to MEPs, and the law is used as a tool to criminalise the exercise of civil and political rights. Parliament is concerned about the 206 political prisoners in the country, deplores the arbitrary closure of another hundred NGOs, and condemns the banning of opposition political parties.\n\nMEPs strongly urge Nicaragua to repeal legislation that unduly restricts the country’s civic and democratic space and they ask the EU to continue supporting civil society organizations there. Parliament wants the EU and the UN Security Council to open a formal investigation into Nicaragua and its president, Daniel Ortega, for crimes against humanity.\n\nThe resolution was adopted by 538 votes in favour, 16 against with 28 abstentions.

    "Ugandan media reflects on covering Queen Elizabeth’s death": "As the world mourns the death of Queen Elizabeth II, Ugandan media has been at the forefront of telling her story.\n\nMany local television and radio stations have had to interrupt normal broadcasting in order to relay events happening in the United Kingdom to their local audiences.\n\nUganda's government newspaper, the New Vision, has been carrying front-page stories remembering the Queens' visit to the country.\n\n\"It was a shock to us but we got on as you know in the media when something happens you immediately prepare yourself and offer the audience what you think would be beneficial to our audience here, so we jumped on the story and because of the historical links we have with Britain, a lot of our people follow the news about the monarchy, about the UK government, about what's happening in Britain - a lot of our people follow that,\" said Felix Osike, the Deputy Editor in Chief, New Vision Uganda.\n\nThere have also been mixed reactions from the public after the death of the monarch, owing to the historical background of the two countries and the bitter legacy of colonialism.\n\n\"Of course now here, among the young people, especially in the newsroom they are cognizant of the fact that well as she has been a great queen there also some dark things to consider especially the slavery and the colonialism,\" said Joyce Nakato, a news reporter and NTV Uganda broadcaster.",
    "‘I watch people for signs’: the project finding and treating Uganda’s diabetic children": "On a night bus out of Kampala, the Ugandan capital, a 12-year-old child was constantly asking her uncle for water. She drank so much that finally she wet herself. Dankan Onzima, on his way home from a conference, was sitting behind the girl.\n\n“I felt bad and touched with what was happening to her,” Onzima says. “I had to wait until my destination, but they were going beyond my stop, so I asked the driver to give me two minutes to talk to the caretaker of the child and the driver allowed.”\n\nHe asked the girl’s uncle to take her to the diabetes clinic at Arua regional referral hospital, in northern Uganda, where Onzima works as a “warrior coordinator”, helping children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) – or warriors, as the hospital refers to them – get treatment and learn to use an insulin pen.\n\nQuick Guide A common condition Show The human toll of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is huge and rising. These illnesses end the lives of approximately 41 million of the 56 million people who die every year – and three quarters of them are in the developing world. NCDs are simply that; unlike, say, a virus, you can’t catch them. Instead, they are caused by a combination of genetic, physiological, environmental and behavioural factors. The main types are cancers, chronic respiratory illnesses, diabetes and cardiovascular disease – heart attacks and stroke. Approximately 80% are preventable, and all are on the rise, spreading inexorably around the world as ageing populations and lifestyles pushed by economic growth and urbanisation make being unhealthy a global phenomenon. NCDs, once seen as illnesses of the wealthy, now have a grip on the poor. Disease, disability and death are perfectly designed to create and widen inequality – and being poor makes it less likely you will be diagnosed accurately or treated. Investment in tackling these common and chronic conditions that kill 71% of us is incredibly low, while the cost to families, economies and communities is staggeringly high. In low-income countries NCDs – typically slow and debilitating illnesses – are seeing a fraction of the money needed being invested or donated. Attention remains focused on the threats from communicable diseases, yet cancer death rates have long sped past the death toll from malaria, TB and HIV/Aids combined. 'A common condition' is a new Guardian series reporting on NCDs in the developing world: their prevalence, the solutions, the causes and consequences, telling the stories of people living with these illnesses.

Thank you for your feedback.\n\nAs Onzima suspected, the girl had T1D and is now receiving free insulin and has a glucometer to keep track of her blood glucose levels.\n\n“Now I am happy that the child is under treatment,” says Onzima. “I closely monitor people around me for any ignored signs and symptoms of T1D.”\n\nOnzima, 24, was diagnosed at the Arua clinic in 2015 – a day he calls “the happiest moment of my life” – after months of not understanding what was wrong. At one point, typhoid and malaria were suspected. It left him feeling “lost, alone and scared, urinating all the time, scared to be outside my house just in case I urinate on myself, losing weight”.\n\nAlthough Onzima now has to carry a glucometer and insulin flex pen, the treatment meant he could pursue his education – he is now in his final year at Uganda’s Muni University.\n\nNurse Jeofrey Ojilong with a young patient at a camp in Lira, Uganda. Photograph: Oscar Ntege/Sonia Nabeta Foundation\n\nThe Arua clinic is among 31 facilities across Uganda participating in a new scheme helping T1D patients, spearheaded by the Sonia Nabeta Foundation (SNF). The foundation uses Uganda’s network of motorcycle taxis, or boda-bodas, to deliver insulin and other supplies to patients in the most remote areas.\n\nThe Covid pandemic and lockdown exacerbated the vulnerabilities of low-income children with T1D, making it impossible for some to access medication.\n\n“In Uganda, the lockdown comprised of a public transportation ban and a 2pm curfew for cargo deliveries. Uganda [had] the world’s longest school lockdown and some of the most stringent Covid restrictions,” says Vivian Nabeta, SNF’s founder.\n\n“In normal circumstances, children from low-income households face difficulties accessing essential supplies from their healthcare centres. Our data has revealed that children sometimes travel up to 5.5 hours round trip to get to and from the clinic for essential supplies, with the major part of the trip on foot.”\n\nOnzima said the use of boda-bodas has bridged the distribution gap, and transformed “how the warriors manage their sugar levels”.\n\n“With home visits, we get to see the warrior in his or her home, see the food he or she eats, see the family and understand better how the warrior is living and how we can help,” he says.\n\nWarrior coordinators Dankan Onzima and Mustapha Abdallah at the diabetes clinic in Arua. Photograph: Sonia Nabeta Foundation\n\nThe SNF was set up in 2016 after Nabeta’s sister, Sonia, died due to hypoglycemia, a T1D complication. Initially, she began organising four-day peer-to-peer education camps, and helped with scholarships for primary school students, before launching the boda-boda project last year, reaching 2,000 children.\n\nMore than 420 million people across the globe have diabetes, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, according to the World Heath Organization. A chronic and metabolic disease characterised by elevated levels of blood sugar, diabetes is responsible for about 1.5 million global deaths a year.\n\nType 2 diabetes, the most prevalent form, is often linked to lifestyle choices, whileT1D is a genetic condition often developed during childhood in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin by itself.\n\n“In Africa, children with T1D face suboptimal outcomes and premature deaths due to a variety of reasons, including lack of access to essential medical supplies and – perhaps most importantly – the failure to address the social determinants of health, including factors like poverty, psychosocial barriers, education,” Nabeta says. Only four paediatric endocrinologists operate across Uganda.\n\n“Our work has illustrated that it is not enough to provide insulin, syringes and a glucometer if the child is surrounded by abject poverty, food insecurity, illiteracy and other barriers towards good clinical outcomes. It has illustrated that addressing the social determinants of health and psychosocial barriers is paramount,” says Nabeta.\n\nShe said children have died from a hypoglycemic attack simply because families did not have any sugary item at home to stop it, while in other households distrust over modern medication has to be overcome.\n\nOne 17-year-old died, despite being on the SNF programme, because his family took his insulin away, resorting to “traditional medicine or going off to prayer crusades hoping the child will be healed”.\n\nProssy Lanyero, a teenage T1D patient at Lacor hospital clinic in Gulu, gets drugs through the boda-boda project. “Transport used to be a very big problem because I am a good distance away from the clinic,” she says.\n\n“I used to have a hard time following my appointment date. I used to ask the nurse to give me insulin for two or three months, but it would go bad because I have no refrigerator to properly store the insulin. I would use the bad insulin anyway because of transport problems,” she says.\n\n“In the past my family used to carry most of the burden of my care and I would feel bad but I feel that some of the weight has been lifted so now they can focus on my other needs too.”\n\nLucy Akwero, the mother of a 14-year-old T1D patient in Amuru, says her family struggled to find money for hospital travel – and her son even stopped going to school because it.\n\n“We were always anxious and worried, and my son was sad and hopeless,” she says. “Sometimes I would even sell our own food when it is approaching my son’s clinic appointment day. We do not have to worry about clinic appointments any more, my son now speaks good English, he is confident and happy.”\n\nSign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:",

    "How William Ruto’s election as Kenya president will impact Uganda": "By DAILY MONITOR More by this Author\n\nThe news of the election of William Ruto as Kenya’s next president was well received across certain quarters of the Ugandan government. His reaffirmation as duly elected by the Supreme Court on Monday is the gift that keeps on giving that Kampala could only have wished for.\n\nWhen Dr Ruto takes over the mantle next Tuesday as Kenya’s fifth president, Kampala will be waiting with bated breath on whether he will reinvigorate the dull spark in Uganda-Kenya relations. Both countries are like Siamese twins tied to the umbilical cord. They share dialects, ethnicities and cultures.\n\nRead: Inside Museveni-Ruto friendship\n\nThey routinely spar over, especially trade, but nothing serious. The uneasy political triangle in Nairobi between Dr Ruto and his archival, five-time presidential contender, Mr Raila Odinga, briefly spiralled to Kampala, but it was nothing serious.\n\nYet, according to diplomatic sources, the Kampala regime frowned upon the possibility of the Odinga presidency. Kampala’s many misgivings with Mr Odinga, whose election petition the Supreme Court unanimously dismissed over lack of evidence, include frolicking with President Museveni’s implacable foe, Dr Kizza Besigye.\n\nThe embers of anti-Ugandan sentiments are also strong in Mr Odinga’s strongholds in parts of western Kenya. During the 2007 election violence, following the contested polls that pitted Mr Odinga against Mwai Kibaki, a section of metre-gauge railway was uprooted and Uganda-bound cargo trucks were targeted. In the aftermath of last month’s Kenya polls, Uganda-bound cargo trucks were re-routed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDr Ruto’s romance with the Kampala establishment jolted some in Nairobi in the months leading to the August elections. While his win has been hailed as breaking the back of dynasty politics, his Kenya Kwanza manifesto under the theme “Shaking up Kenya through Bottom Up Economy” hardly mentions his foreign policy prescriptions, which raises fears that his administration might not break ranks nor alter much of his predecessor’s policies.\n\nUganda barely has a foreign policy—it is largely conjured based on the mood of the Executive—but in his manifesto for 2021-2026, President Museveni detailed several ways to further relations with especially the East African Community (EAC).\n\nKenya, which serves as Uganda’s gateway to the sea, is an economic powerhouse in sub-Saharan Africa. As such, the country has sparred with Uganda and Tanzania over non-tariff barriers to curtail imports and promote the domestic market.\n\nRead: Kenya’s change of guard: Why neighbours watch every step\n\nUnlike Uganda, which has a lot at stake, Tanzania reciprocates swiftly whenever Nairobi takes such a hard stance.\n\nThe outgoing Kenyatta administration enacted the Foreign Service Act—signed in November 2021—to guide Kenya’s foreign relations and engagements, including regional integration, which will be tried and tested to the fullest by the incoming government.\n\nDuring his first term as Deputy President, Dr Ruto represented Kenya on a number of foreign assignments, including addressing the United Nations General Assembly in September 2016. The delegation seems to have waned as his relationship with his boss soured.\n\nSGR venture\n\nBesides cementing bilateral relations between the countries and offering room for intra-trade, Kampala also hopes that the Ruto administration will rekindle plans and agree to finance the remaining sections of the shinny Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) connecting Malaba en route to Kampala, which plans were first reached in 2008.\n\nThe arrangements for the much-touted SGR were subsequently concretised in 2012 with the two countries agreeing to construct China Class One standard, whose design classification according to the Chinese standards, is one with annual passengers/freight traffic volume for the near-term, which is more than or equal to 20 metric tonnes.\n\nWhile the plan was to borrow money jointly from China’s Exim Bank for the regional project, Nairobi did not live up to its promise and started parallel negotiations shortly and acquired $3.8 billion for the Mombasa to Nairobi section, and later the 120km line from Nairobi to Naivasha at $1.7 billion.\n\nKenya eventually took its foot off the gas pedal on the plans after Uganda, with the backing of French oil giant now TotalEnergies EP, opted for the southern route as the least cost for the route of the proposed East African Crude Oil Pipeline.\n\nThe Northern Corridor Integration Projects (NCIP), a loose cooperation of EAC involving Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda, and South Sudan—to work together on joint infrastructure projects, including the SGR stretching from the Indian Ocean port of Mombasa to Kampala en route to Kigali and Juba—also collapsed. There is all indication of little appetite for the NCIP, especially after the bruising ego Kampala-Kigali disagreements and it will remain to be seen if Dr Ruto can revive the coalition.",

    "Uganda holds first ever commemoration service for murdered chief justice": "26 September 2022 John Semakula\n\nKampala, Uganda\n\nUgandans have held the first ever commemoration service for former Chief Justice Benedicto Kiwanuka who was kidnapped and killed by Dictator Idi Amin in 1972.\n\nThe commemoration service held on Thursday at Lubaga Cathedral in Kampala was one of the activities conducted in the week to commemorate the life of a man considered by many in Uganda as an icon of justice and democracy whose murder affected Uganda’s pace of becoming a just and democratic nation.\n\nPresident Yoweri Museveni (left) arriving for the Benedicto Kiwanuka Commemoration Day at the High Court in Kampala on Wednesday. PICTURE: State House Picture.\n\nKiwanuka was one of the early leaders in the independence movement of Uganda and led the country as Prime Minister in the transition between colonial British rule and independence in 1962. He was also the President of the Democratic Party, one of the country’s two main Independence political parties. Kiwanuka was appointed Chief Justice in 1971, the year Idi Amin captured power through a military coup.\n\nHe is one of the thousands of Ugandans who were slaughtered during Amin’s reign of chaos and terror. Kiwanuka’s remains have never been located since 1972.\n\nIn a 2018 editorial titled \"Remembering Benedicto Kiwanuka\", Solomon Muyita, the senior communication officer with the judiciary in Uganda, observed that despite his short-lived period in office, Kiwanuka left an indelible mark in the country’s legal fraternity.\n\n“His mastery of the law, impartiality and zeal for the rule of law have inspired many over the decades,” Muyita wrote. “He fiercely and above self, protected the rights of all for which he paid the ultimate price with his life.”\n\nIn his book, Uganda Since Independence: A Story of unfilled Hopes, author Phares Mutibwa asserted that Amin murdered Kiwanuka because he perceived him to be a potential rival leader. Eyewitnesses reports indicate that the army seized Kiwanuka from the High Court although Amin’s military denied the allegations, insisting that government impostors then were behind his disappearance.\n\nDuring last Thursday’s commemoration service, Kiwanuka was praised for his exemplary leadership while a priest, Fr Richard Nyombi, said there had been calls for the Catholic Church to have Kiwanuka canonised.\n\nArchbishop Augustine Kasujja, a former Apostolic Nuncio, said in a sermon that “we cannot speak of peace and justice as human beings without real effort and determination to create an ethical and moral background for our society\". He urged the flock to emulate Kiwanuka.\n\nIn his remarks, Uganda’s current Chief Justice, Alfonse Owiny-Dollo, noted that people like Kiwanuka are very rare in the world today.\n\n“They come to serve a purpose, which is discovered long after they are gone. When you study Uganda’s political history, then you understand the importance of such people.”\n\nRev Emanuel Sita, the archdiocese’s Department of Peace and Justice, said that Archbishop Paul Ssemogerere had decided to hold a memorial mass for Benedicto Kiwanuka on the day he is believed to have been killed as part of its activities marking Peace Week, which ran from 1st to 9th September.\n\n“Besides being the son of the Catholic Church, Benedicto was also an active and practicing parishioner of Lubaga Cathedral Parish,\" he said.\n\nWe rely on our readers to fund Sight's work - become a financial supporter today!\n\nOn Wednesday, Uganda's judiciary held a commemoration to mark the 5th Benedicto Kiwanuka’s Day. President Yoweri Museveni was among those who attended, saluting the former chief justice for being forthright and truthful by opposing chauvinism and the adoption of a tribal agenda in favour of a national position and unity.\n\nBut Museveni said Kiwanuka should not have accepted to work under Amin from the start.\n\n“Kiwanuka turned out to be a martyr under circumstances he should not have been in the first place,” Museveni said.\n\nThe main opposition political figure in Uganda, Robert Kyagulanyi, alias Bobi Wine, said during the service that Benedicto Kiwanuka’s Day came at the time when Uganda was still struggling with political challenges similar to those that existed in Amin’s regime and that supporters of his political party, the National Unity Platform, are being kidnapped, tortured and imprisoned by the state.",
    "Nyege Nyege, Uganda’s controversial but irresistible festival, is back on": "Why does the popular music festival keep getting banned and then un-banned?\n\nFirst staged in 2015, the globally touted Nyege Nyege Festival in Uganda is a four-day dance party and a major tourism drawcard that caters to lovers of electronic dance music. After a three-year break due to COVID-19, the 2022 festival is taking place from 15-18 September. Over 300 DJs and performers will participate across seven stages, with 10,000 revellers expected to attend. But Nyege Nyege nearly didn’t happen. Uganda’s parliament banned it – and not for the first time – on the grounds that it promotes “sexual immorality”. Eventually the prime minister gave it the go-ahead.\n\nTourism lecturer Amos Ochieng has studied the festival and explains its ongoing dilemma.\n\nWhy is Nyege Nyege so controversial?\n\nThe festival promotes electronic dance music and was established by promoters Arlen Dilsizian and Derek Debru to meet the demand among young Ugandans for all-night dance partying. Even though Nyege Nyege is promoting the theme of environmental conservation and inclusivity this year, it has been the subject of moral outrage and heated debate. The controversy has a lot to do with its name – Nyege Nyege – and the choice of a large new location at the banks of the Nile river, at Itanda Falls, a venue reportedly five times larger than before.\n\nIn the Luganda language of Uganda, “nyege nyege” is interpreted as an irresistible urge to dance. One dictionary definition says it means “an intensive feeling for the urgency in need for intimacy, closure and physical exploration”. However, in the Kiswahili language of the larger region, “nyege nyege” is slang for “horny, horny” and is used in relation to sexual urges. As a contemporary and popular musical event, Nyege Nyege is, according to one study, intended to “create intense and affective aesthetic experiences for its participants”.\n\nDuring a recent parliamentary session, an MP ardently argued for its cancellation. Parliamentarians, religious and opinion leaders, human rights activists and some government officials have publicly questioned the integrity of the event. They believe it is a breeding ground for sexual immorality. The speaker of parliament declared it banned just over a week before it was to be held.\n\nControversially, in just less than 24 hours, an emergency meeting chaired by the prime minister cleared the event to take place. She argued that it was too late to cancel as thousands of tourists were expected for the festival. A banning would cause financial losses. She assured the public that the event would take place under strict guidelines, including no underage guests and no nudity.\n\nThe roots of the resistance to the festival lie in the fact that Uganda is a conservative country with a wish to preserve “traditional values”. Homosexuality, for example, is outlawed in the country under a law inherited from the British during the colonial period. The Sexual Offences Bill of 2021 criminalises same-sex relations, sex work and a range of other offences.\n\nIn 2018, the Nyege Nyege Festival was cancelled by Uganda’s ethics and integrity minister on moral grounds but was later cleared to continue. This could be seen as part of government’s commitment to turn Ugandan music and local entertainment into economic goods forming a core part of the creative tourism industry segment. After all, the production of specialised music has a cohesive role in creating local identities and touristic images and products. These can be promoted and marketed to diversify Uganda’s tourism product base.\n\nThe key challenge, though, is that these controversies only mirror the lack of coordination between government departments and agencies. This is the seventh edition of the event. Why should authorities wait until just a few days to the event before raising concerns? If the event can potentially destroy cultures, why not come up with a clear policy and ban it completely or modify it? There is an urgent need for Uganda to develop regulatory guidelines instead of being reactionary.\n\nWhat role does the festival play for tourism?\n\nMusic and dance are a growing part of the creative tourism industry. Like other festivals and cultural displays, they are part of the everyday spaces of leisure, a source of artistic expression and audience pleasure.\n\nRegarding the current controversy, I would think that organisers and enthusiasts are loving it. There are indications that they are getting free publicity in mainstream and social media. The ping-pong game by the government appears to create increased curiosity and the #NyegeNyege hashtag has been trending. Uganda has one of the youngest populations in the world and young Ugandans are strongly influenced by social media.\n\nAllowing Nyege Nyege to continue also reflects Uganda’s preparedness to handle large numbers of tourists in the aftermath of the pandemic. The event will provide opportunities for the sale of locally produced materials for improved local livelihoods. As an opportunity for cross-cultural interactions, Ugandan cultures could feature prominently.\n\nThe electronic dance music community is a new niche with enthusiastic promoters recruiting new members to build a like-minded community. This community boasts diverse audiences with diverse artistic tastes and consists of smaller (local, translocal or virtual) groups of musicians, fans, promoters and the like.\n\nWhat is the future for an event like Nyege Nyege?\n\nUganda, with its strong religious and cultural foundation, will continue to challenge the promotion of Nyege Nyege.\n\nLocal music articulates issues around identity, conformity, performance, status, community, subculture, high culture, technology, power relations, education, place and space. How best can all these aspects be integrated to embrace the electronic dance music community for a sustainable tourism industry in Uganda – while still preserving the sanctity of cultural values?\n\nThe government departments and agencies responsible for tourism should work with the organisers to draw the best alternatives to promote and conduct the event, and still preserve our cultures. Unless they do, I expect that the event will continue to receive backlash.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license. Read the original article.",
    "Will Uganda’s plan to check disaster work?": "Natural disasters have continued to wreak havoc across the country, and the Ministry of Relief, Disaster Preparedness and Refugees under the Office of the Prime Minister says the country has lost billions of shillings while dealing with disasters.\n\nAccording to the Office of the Prime Minister, a post-disaster needs assessment conducted jointly by the government and non-governmental actors in 2020 stated that the cost of economic losses caused by disasters in 2019 and 2020 stood at Shs577.9 billion ($152m). This is expected to rise this year due to the recent floods and subsequent landslides in the eastern and western parts of the country.\n\nA similar process to review disaster impacts in 2010 and 2011 had projected much higher economic losses and impacts of up to $752m (Shs2.9 trillion).\n\nOn Tuesday, the government launched the Disaster Management Plan aimed at addressing some of the issues caused by disasters in the country.\n\nThe launch was held at the Office of the Prime Minister. Present at the function were Ms Lukia Nakadama, the Third Deputy Prime Minister, Ms Esther Anyakun, the State minister for Relief, Disaster Preparedness and Refugees, among others.\n\n“These significant increases in disaster impacts have negatively affected the ability of the country to sustain its socio-economic and political gains and thus retard the projected pace of development,” Uganda’s Disaster Management Plan reads in part.\n\nIt adds that Uganda is exposed to a wide range of hazards associated with the country’s diverse geo-climatic and socio-economic conditions such as drought, floods, earthquakes, landslides, environmental emergencies, and refugee crises.\n\nAccording to Statista Disaster Monitoring Network, Uganda was ranked 15th globally and the first in Africa that is most affected by natural disasters.\n\nThe Disaster Management Plan states that climate change is expected to increase further exposure to disasters that will erode the coping capacities of individuals, households and communities.\n\nDisasters have caused loss of lives and livelihoods as well as socio-economic and environmental impacts in Uganda.\n\nThe National Risk and Vulnerability Atlas report estimates that between 1930 and 2019, about 2,718 Ugandans lost their lives as a result of landslides alone while the World Bank estimates that between 1900 and 2018, a total of 200,000 deaths were registered as a result of disasters in the country.\n\nThe same report estimates that droughts affected close to 2.4 million people between 2004 and 2013.\n\nIt adds that more recently floods have caused the deaths and displacements of several people. In 2002, at least 1,000 deaths were reported and 150,000 people were displaced while in 2007, there were 21 deaths registered and 300,000 people displaced.\n\nIn 2013 (nine deaths and 32,219 displaced), 2019 (36 deaths and thousands displaced), 2020 (72 deaths and 87,000 displaced), 2021 (one dead and more than 1,000 displaced) and 2022 (nine deaths and 1,000 displaced).\n\nConsequently, the document says over the decades, disaster risk impacts have increased in frequency and magnitude. Between 2010 and 2014, disasters reduced GDP performance by an average of 3.5 percent.\n\nThe Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations put the cost of the 2008-2011 drought on the agricultural sector at about $863 million, which is the equivalent of about 7.5 percent of the 2011 GDP.\n\nThe 2016 drought, on the other hand, reduced the GDP to about 2.3 percent and led to an increase in poverty from 19.7 to 21.4 percent. It also left five million people food insecure, diverted Shs25 billion allocated for development to relief food, and necessitated the reallocation of Shs63 billion for emergency planting materials, among others.\n\nAccording to the Disaster Management Plan, with increased effects of climate change, the environment is impacted by cyclic disasters and that over a third of Uganda (75,300 km²) is susceptible to hailstorm impact on the environment. Approximately 41,574 km² (58 percent) of national parks, 48,687 km² (87 percent) of wildlife reserves and 26870 km² (47 percent) of forest reserves are exposed to floods.\n\n“These combined environmental impacts are related to land degradation, wetland degradation, deforestation, pollution, and poor solid waste management that are a threat to food security, economic progress and livelihoods of Ugandans,” it states.\n\nResource needs estimation\n\nAccording to the disaster response plan, Uganda needs an estimated Shs10.6 trillion ($2.8 billion) to manage disasters. The Disaster Management Plan states that the government is providing initial seed funds of $50 million (Shs190 billion) to support the Department of Disaster Preparedness and Management (DDPM) in OPM. The document says DDPM/OPM, National Planning Authority, and ministries, Departments and Authorities will review the total government estimated contribution towards funding the plan within the next three years and define the funding gap that will be presented to the donors and other stakeholders.\n\nDuring the opening of a high-level meeting in Kampala yesterday Ms Nakadama, who delivered a speech on behalf of Prime Minister Robinah Nabbanja, said the past decade has seen the country experience very costly and disastrous disasters that have cost lives, property and led to massive displacement and loss of livelihoods.\n\n“Our people have faced landslides, floods, droughts, hailstorms, lightening, among other disasters. Some of the most recent disasters are still fresh in our minds,” Ms Nakadama said."
