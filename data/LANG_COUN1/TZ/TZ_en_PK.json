    "Military Helicopter Crashes in Southwest Pakistan, 6 Soldiers Killed": "Pakistan’s military said Monday that one of its helicopters crashed in a turbulent southwestern district, killing all six soldiers on board.\n\nThe helicopter went down during a “flying mission” in Khost, a remote town in the province of Baluchistan late on Sunday and two major-ranked officers were among the dead, an army statement said. It shared no further details, nor did it give any reason for the crash or type of aircraft.\n\nThe so-called Balochistan Liberation Army insurgent group claimed in a statement it had shot down the helicopter. It said the helicopter had arrived in the area to rescue two army officers BLA militants had kidnapped in an ambush in the district.\n\nThe claims could not be verified immediately from independent sources and insurgents often release exaggerated details about their activities in the region.\n\nOutlawed ethnic Baluch groups routinely plot attacks against military targets in the impoverished Pakistani province, which borders Afghanistan and Iran.\n\nEarly last month, six senior Pakistani military officers were killed when their helicopter crashed due to bad weather during a flood relief activity in Baluchistan’s Lasbela district. An army lieutenant general, a major-general and a brigadier were among those killed.\n\nHeavy monsoon rains have caused catastrophic flooding in parts of Pakistan, including Baluchistan, killing more than 1,600 people and washing away villages, roads, bridges and hundreds of thousands of homes since mid-June.",

    "Flood-ravaged Pakistan’s leader appeals for urgent global support in UN address": "“No words can describe the shock we are living through or how the face of the country lies transformed,” Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif told the General Assembly’s annual high-level debate.\n\n“For 40 days and 40 nights a biblical flood poured down on us, smashing centuries of weather records, challenging everything we knew about disaster, and how to manage it.”\n\nNo starker evidence of global warming\n\nClose to eight million people have been displaced by the disaster, according to the UN, which along with the authorities and partners have continued to reach affected populations with desperately needed relief items. To date, more than 1,500 people have been killed, including 552 children.\n\nThe Prime Minister noted that some 33 million people are now at risk of health hazards; more than 13,000 kilometres of roads have been damaged; one million homes have been destroyed and another million damaged; and four million acres of crops have been washed away.\n\n“Pakistan has never seen a starker and more devastating example of the impact of global warming,” he stressed. “Life in Pakistan has changed forever.”\n\nOn his visit to the country earlier this month, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said he had never seen “climate carnage on this scale,” and called for urgent financial support to help Pakistan, saying it is not just a question of solidarity but a question of justice.\n\nThe Prime Minister noted: “Nature has unleashed her fury on Pakistan without looking at our carbon footprint, which is next to nothing. Our actions did not contribute to this.”\n\nHe added that the current priority is to ensure rapid economic growth and lift millions out of destitution, which requires a stable external environment.\n\nSustainable peace in South Asia\n\n“Sustainable peace and stability in South Asia, however, remains contingent upon a just and lasting solution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute. At the heart of this longstanding dispute lies the denial of the inalienable right of the Kashmiri people to self-determination,” he said.\n\nThe Prime Minister added that in a “classic settler-colonial project,” India is seeking to turn the Muslim-majority Jammu and Kashmir into a Hindu-majority territory through “illegal demographic changes.”\n\n“Millions of fake ‘domicile certificates’ have been issued to non-Kashmiris; Kashmiri land and properties are being seized; electoral districts have been gerrymandered; and over 2.5 million non-Kashmiri illegal voters fraudulently registered. All this is in blatant violation of Security Council resolutions and international law, particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention.”\n\nHe called on the United Nations and the Secretary-General to play their rightful role in urging India to implement existing UN resolutions on this issue.\n\nThe position of the UN on this region is governed by the UN Charter and applicable Security Council resolutions. The Secretary-General maintains that the final settlement of Jammu and Kashmir is to be reached by peaceful means, in accordance with the UN Charter and bilateral agreements.",
    "Islamic Relief’s Pakistan Floods Response 2022 (26 September, 2022) - Pakistan": "Damages and destructions by floods in Pakistan has made the world think once again about how much they have been affecting the climate of the earth. The underdeveloped countries are facing worst effects of climate change. And Pakistan contributing less than 1% in the global carbon emissions, is the 8th worst affected. Rains breaking the record of last 3 decades and 7,000 glaciers melting in the north of country has contributed immensely in water level rising in dams and rivers resulting in devastating floods. Over 33 million people have been affected by the floods in 2 months and 116 districts have been affected with 84 of them declared as calamity hit.\n\nOver two months of destruction has left millions of families without their livelihoods and villages swallowed by the floods. 1,638 people have died including 588 children and 12,865 injuries in these floods. Since the season started 2 million people have lost their homes and are now living under the open sky with no source of food and water, livestock dying and children on the verge of facing dangerous water bourne diseases. Over 1.1 million livestock animals have perished in the floods leaving people with nothing except hope to restart their lives. Estimates indicate that over 2,000 health facilities have been affected by the heavy rains and floods, and the Health Sector reports that access to health facilities, healthcare workers, and essential medicines and medical supplies remain limited. Early disease surveillance indicates that tens of thousands of people are affected by diarrhea, malaria, acute respiratory infections, skin and eye infections and typhoid.\n\nInfrastructural damages are making difficulties for the rescue teams and humanitarian organizations to reach the affected areas and do their relief work. With 13,074 KM of roads partially or fully damaged and 392 bridges destroyed, limiting the aid delivery to those in need. The total loss so far that Pakistan has faced is expected be over $20 billion.\n\nPeople are facing extreme difficulty in meeting their most essential needs as the inflation increases due to huge loss of standing crops and agricultural lands, resulting in depreciation of the economy. To get back to where Pakistan and these people were before these floods, could take months or even years. That is the amount of damage this country has received. More than 4.4 million acres of crops and orchards have been affected, with at least 304,000 acres in Balochistan, 438,000 acres in Punjab, and over 3 million acres in Sindh.\n\nCEO IRW Waseem Ahmad and Country Director Islamic Relief Pakistan met with the Prime Minister of Pakistan Shahbaz Sharif and Federal Minister, Ministry of Planning Development & Special Initiatives, Ahsan Iqbal and ensured that Islamic Relief will keep helping the people until they are back on their feet.\n\nUnited Nations General Secretary Antonio Guterres visited flood affected areas in Pakistan and met with Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif, discussing the situation of affected right now and how the international community can help with the relief work. Making sure that UN will stand with the people who have been affected, he said it is essential for the international community to start noticing the effects of climate change before it’s too late.",
    "Pakistan’s Finance Minister Ismail to resign amid economic woes": "Miftah Ismail is the fifth finance minister to quit in less than four years as Pakistan’s economic woes are worsened by recent flooding.\n\nPakistan’s Finance Minister Miftah Ismail has said he will formally resign from the role amid an economic crisis exacerbated by the recent devastating flooding, as he becomes the fifth finance minister to resign in less than four years.\n\n“I have verbally resigned as Finance Minister,” Ismail said in a Tweet on Sunday, adding that he had signalled his plans to the country’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif during a meeting. “I will tender a formal resignation upon reaching Pakistan,” he added.\n\nIsmail and Sharif are currently in London and due to return to Pakistan early next week.\n\nIn a meeting with Mian Nawaz Sharif and PM Shehbaz Sharif today, I have verbally resigned as Finance Minister.

The $2bn figure includes that amount.\n\nOver the past two months, Pakistan has sent nearly 10,000 doctors, nurses and other medical staff to tend to survivors in Sindh province – the worst affected by the floods.\n\nIsmail, echoed by the prime minister, reassured investors on Friday that the South Asian nation was seeking debt relief from bilateral creditors and emphasised the government would not seek any relief from commercial banks or Eurobond creditors.",
    "How the U.S. is helping Pakistan overcome severe floods": "The United States and partner organizations continue to provide support for Pakistan’s recovery from disastrous floods that have affected 33 million people.\n\nThe U.S. government has provided more than $56 million in flood relief and humanitarian assistance for Pakistan this year. More than $50 million of the assistance has come through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). The State Department provided an additional $2 million to support the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees’ response effort in Pakistan, and $1.4 million in Defense Department funding helped airlift supplies.\n\nThe funding helps provide food, drinking water, nutrition, sanitation, shelter assistance and other aid to the country, where heavy monsoon rains have caused flooding, landslides and glacial lake outbursts. Nearly 1,600 people have been killed and an estimated 12,900 injured, USAID said.\n\n“We’ll continue to provide assistance to our partners in this time of need,” State Department Spokesperson Ned Price said September 13, noting that U.S. and Pakistani officials have been working together to assess the damage.\n\nA USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team and Pakistan’s National Disaster Management Authority have worked together to assess damage and identify priority humanitarian needs.\n\nU.S., partners provide assistance\n\nU.S. assistance supports partners’ efforts to reduce hunger and disease risk after floods destroyed 1.8 million hectares of cropland and damaged sanitation systems.\n\nUSAID supports the U.N. World Food Programme’s distribution of food and cash assistance to buy food for approximately 341,500 people across Pakistan. The effort brings wheat, yellow split peas, vegetable oil, iodized salt and supplies to treat and prevent malnutrition.\n\nUSAID partner organization Concern Worldwide, headquartered in Dublin, is providing safe drinking water, hygiene items and water removal services for 283,000 people. “Concern is also providing shelter repair kits, tools, kitchen sets and plastic sheeting to help people whose houses have been damaged or destroyed,” USAID says.\n\nTo deliver assistance quickly, USAID asked that the Defense Department airlift supplies to hard-hit areas. U.S. Air Force cargo planes delivered nearly 630 metric tons of relief supplies from USAID’s warehouse in Dubai to Pakistan, completing the mission September 16.\n\nU.S. government–built schools have served as shelters for displaced people after floods damaged or destroyed more than 2 million homes.\n\n“The United States is deeply saddened for the flood victims and the loss of loved ones, livelihoods, and homes throughout Pakistan,” USAID said in a September 9 statement. “We stand with communities in Pakistan during this difficult time and will continue to help them in this time of need.”",
    "Pakistan’s Biblical Floods and the Case for Climate Reparations": "We have tried, in various ways, to convey to the world the scale of destruction caused by recent floods in Pakistan, because, apparently, a third of the country underwater and thirty-three million lives upended doesn’t cut it. Pakistan’s climate minister has called it Biblical. We have shot and shared videos in which the landmark New Honeymoon Hotel crumbles in the duration of a TikTok. The U.N. Secretary-General, António Guterres, who is seventy-three and has called the climate crisis a “code red for humanity,” visited Pakistan and said that he hadn’t seen this scale of climate carnage in his life. Some of us have created maps showing that the areas underwater are larger than Britain. We have shown pictures of dead and starving cattle to appeal to animal-lovers. We have posted videos of puppies being heroically rescued from rushing waters.\n\nMaybe when the world seems to be ending, it needs poets. A poet in Khairpur, in southern Pakistan, one of the worst-affected areas, was asked by a journalist if he had received a tent to shelter his family. He found the idea so improbable that he asked, “Why are you making fun of me? Why would anyone give me a tent?” Pakistanis are saying that charity tents and emergency supplies are welcome, but what we need and want is compensation for climate-related loss and damage. Although much of the world seems to agree in principle, there is a we-have-all-heard-this-before weariness in the air. Our innovative communications have little impact. The U.S. has offered fifty million dollars and “long-term” support, the U.N. has appealed for a hundred and sixty million, France has offered to hold a donors’ conference, Angelina Jolie has flown in and said that she’s never seen such devastation. President Biden casually mentioned at the U.N. General Assembly that Pakistan “needs help,” without any specifics. This all sounds like a lot until you remember that Pakistan’s losses are estimated to be around thirty billion dollars.\n\nExperts have pointed out that this is not the kind of flood that causes weeks of havoc and then leaves behind fertile lands. Six months from now, flooded fields still may not be ready for cultivation. Most people affected by the floods live off the land, from crop to crop. Waterborne diseases and food shortages are already rampant. Climate scientists who have studied Pakistani floods have concluded that they can only predict more unpredictability.\n\nScientists are clear, however, that the catastrophe in Pakistan is linked to global warming. Pakistan generates less than one per cent of the world’s carbon emissions. We are quite good at blaming ourselves and our governments for our misfortunes, but global warming is overwhelmingly caused by rich folks living thousands of miles away, mostly in the West, by people who know that their air-conditioned homes and midsize cars and Caribbean holidays have snatched away the home and livelihood of someone in a village in Pakistan.\n\nThe West sees its culpability in this man-made disaster but prefers to blame the victim. I think of a fable that I grew up with, in which a lamb drinks from a river downstream until a lion accuses it of polluting the river upstream. In the version of the fable that I remember, the lion eats the lamb as punishment. Imagine this: the driver of an S.U.V. speeds into a country lane, hits a person on a bicycle, and then, instead of paying damages, asks the cyclist to drive an electric vehicle powered by renewable energy. The driver of the S.U.V. wonders why the cyclist wasn’t more resilient, and asks, “Why didn’t you plan for a future where my car might come and destroy your bicycle and break your leg? You could have prepared for a better future, for apocalyptic floods, but what did you do? You prepared a petition for reparations? And you don’t even have a practical plan for how these reparations would work?”\n\nThose calling for climate reparations received an answer from America’s climate envoy, John Kerry, at the U.N. General Assembly last week. “You tell me the government in the world that has trillions of dollars, ’cause that’s what it costs,” he said, perhaps steeling himself for difficult questions at November’s global climate conference, COP27, in Egypt. Western governments do have trillions of dollars, and they have had more than a decade to think through how climate reparations should work. Kerry sounded like he was haggling over the price of life jackets with drowning people.\n\nMaybe Pakistan could have handled the current floods better if we had done our homework. We had a massive flood in 2010, experts were flown in, reports and studies were commissioned and then shelved. But Pakistan, like its Western allies, had other priorities: we were busy in neighboring Afghanistan, helping America defeat the Taliban, or maybe helping the Taliban defeat America—we are still not sure. On the other border, we were busy with India. Even in the week of our Biblical floods, we managed to finalize a deal with the United States worth four hundred and fifty million dollars, to upgrade our F-16 fighter planes. We may not know how we are going to feed our people for the next six months, but we have made sure that we can keep them safe from hostile aircraft.\n\nLike Westerners, Pakistani élites planned for security and progress. We turned agricultural lands into golf courses and gated communities, and built houses on riverbeds, and grew cash crops along waterways. We thought less about the millions who live in mud houses, who till someone else’s land to feed their kids and save a bit in hopes of sending them to school one day. Now the water has turned their houses back into mud, and washed away the grain that they stocked for the entire year, and flooded the land that still belongs to someone else. They dare not dream of justice, let alone climate justice.\n\nExperts tell us that the world suffers from donor fatigue, what with a war in Ukraine, in which people with fair skin and blue eyes are fleeing their homes and fighting for their lives. What goes unsaid is that hearts have been hardened by repeated images of brown mothers cradling skeletal children who are covered in flies, along overflowing rivers or scorched fields. Or maybe rich nations think that they should save their money for when the disasters come for them.\n\nSometimes my own compatriots tell the world, If you don’t listen, it could happen to you. The West seems unfazed by this logic: climate carnage has happened there, is happening there. Perhaps the West fears that if it acknowledges any debt to a country like Pakistan, it will no longer be able to withhold what it owes its own citizens. A childhood friend lived in Lake Charles, Louisiana, for most of his life, and in the span of a year his house and business were destroyed thrice, first by Hurricane Laura, then snow, then flooding. He reluctantly put his house up for sale, moved to Los Angeles, and slowly started to build a life. The aid that the government promised to Lake Charles hasn’t arrived. After Hurricane Maria, hundreds of thousands of Americans in Puerto Rico were denied federal assistance. They were still vulnerable when Hurricane Fiona brought floods and blackouts again, this week. The lamb does not escape the lion by showing a U.S. passport.\n\nA global climate movement has made people aware of their carbon footprint, of the impact of their eating habits, of the evils of fossil-fuel companies, but it has yet to convince people that they and their governments can and should pay for what they helped to destroy. They must, because the losses and damages will only grow, and because the West became rich from the burning of fossil fuels, and because the village that is drowning may one day be their own.\n\nWhen rich nations refuse to acknowledge that countries such as Pakistan need climate reparations, they not only shirk their responsibility now but set a precedent of inaction and impunity, even within their own borders. They seem to say, We can build walls so high that the polluted air will only poison you. When it melts glaciers, only you will drown, and when your fields are flooded, only you will go hungry. We can give you a few thousand tents to shelter your millions, or rafts to float you over what used to be self-sustaining villages, but we don’t owe you anything. If it happens to us, rich countries seem to say, we won’t starve. We can always eat you. ♦",

    "Pakistan PM says ‘all hell will break loose’ without debt relief": "As Pakistan reels under an unprecedented flood crisis, Shehbaz Sharif appeals for debt relief and urges more help from the global community.\n\nIslamabad, Pakistan – Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif says “all hell will break loose” if his flood-ravaged country is not provided with debt relief by rich nations.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg TV on Friday morning, Sharif sought a moratorium on Pakistan’s debt repayment from the Paris Club (a group of rich creditor countries) and others, saying there is a “yawning gap” between what is being asked for and what is available.\n\n“We have requested (United Nations) secretary-general and European leaders to give us relief. How can the world expect us to stand on our own feet? It is simply impossible,” Sharif said in his interview, also aired on Pakistan’s state television.\n\nThere is primarily one argument I made in my interview with Bloomberg. Given the vast scale & extent of destruction caused by the floods, the rich countries should consider giving debt relief to Pakistan so that we can stand up on our feet. Climate disaster is not of our making. — Shehbaz Sharif (@CMShehbaz) September 23, 2022\n\nReferring to a visit to the flood-hit nation by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres earlier this month, Sharif said: “He saw this calamity with his own eyes. He said: ‘Prime Minister, it is unbelievable’. He is a man who has been dedicating his life for humanitarian causes for many years … He said he had never seen this kind of a climatic situation in his life.”\n\n“We are among the top 10 most vulnerable countries (to climate change),” he said.\n\nSharif again thanked US President Joe Biden for speaking about “Pakistan and our plight” at the United Nations General Assembly.\n\n“Many world leaders have discussed and openly said that Pakistan needs support more than ever and this shows sincerity of these leaders. But time is running out and we are racing against time,” he said.\n\nSharif is in New York for the annual UNGA, which he is expected to address later on Friday. He has already met several world leaders as part of his appeal to the international community to help Pakistan as it reels from unprecedented floods.\n\n“What the world has done is commendable but it is far from meeting our needs. We can’t do it alone,” Sharif said in the interview.\n\nThe floods in Pakistan, triggered by record monsoon rains and melting glaciers, have affected 33 million people, killed nearly 1,600 people and destroyed more than a million homes. The stagnant floodwaters have raised concerns of a “second disaster” as waterborne diseases have killed more than 300 people so far.\n\nThe government last month estimated the total loss at $30bn, creating concerns that Pakistan will not be able to repay $1bn in international bonds by December.\n\nSharif’s appeal for aid came amid a report by the Financial Times newspaper on Friday, which said the UN Development Programme (UNDP) has prepared a memo suggesting Pakistan should suspend its international debt repayments and restructure loans in the aftermath of the catastrophic floods.\n\nHowever, a top finance ministry official in Pakistan, requesting anonymity, rejected the report, telling Al Jazeera that “no such proposal is on the table as yet”.\n\nOfficials at Pakistan’s UNDP office did not respond to Al Jazeera queries about the memo. Questions to Pakistan’s finance ministry and other government officials also went unanswered.\n\nLate last month, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) released a long-stalled bailout package of $1.17bn, staving off a major economic disaster in Pakistan.\n\nThe IMF’s latest report says Pakistan’s total bilateral debt due in the next financial year is close to $7bn, almost 2 percent of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP). It also owes nearly $30bn to its close ally China – the amount making up roughly 30 percent of the country’s GDP.\n\nSharif, in his interview with Bloomberg TV, said he will “most definitely” request debt relief from China.\n\nPakistan’s debt crisis was also brought up by the UN’s Guterres on Tuesday in his opening remarks at the UNGA, where he urged global leaders to consider debt reduction mechanisms to help Pakistan.\n\n“These (mechanisms) could have saved lives and livelihoods in Pakistan, which is drowning not only in floodwater but also in debt,” Guterres said.\n\nExperts say there is a possibility that Pakistan’s bilateral debt will be restructured in the wake of the floods.\n\n“This will provide some breathing space for the country as any fund allocated to debt servicing can be reallocated to public welfare and the social sector,” economist Ammar H Khan told Al Jazeera.",

    "The Metaverse opens up a world of possibilities for Pakistan. Can we take advantage?": "Pakistan should consciously pull back and refocus exclusively on technologies shaping the future.\n\nListen to article 1x 1.2x 1.5x\n\nIt feels wrong to mention Pakistan and the Metaverse in the same sentence. The latter is the oncoming pinnacle of human technology, while the former is a developing country, stuck in what seems to be a perpetual cycle of economic and geopolitical turmoil. It seems Pakistan will be the last country to enter the Metaverse in any shape or form.\n\nHowever, Pakistan’s troubles are already a known quantity. This article is an attempt to chart a better future, not wail about the past or the present.\n\nWhat is the Metaverse?\n\nThe Metaverse is the successor to today’s Internet. Think of the Metaverse as a universe of inter-connected virtual words. And just like smartphone users jump between apps on mobile devices, Metaverse users will jump from one world to another without needing to return to real life.\n\nSo who is building this Metaverse?\n\nMany companies. Our state of technology is naturally advancing in such a direction that the Metaverse is emerging ipso facto. It’s like how the Internet emerged in the 1990s, through the interplay of rising consumer expectations, and the confluence of various technological advances in the decades before. Those same demand and supply forces are at work now. And while we’re beginning to sense traces of the Metaverse, our children will see it in full bloom.\n\nDon’t think of the Metaverse as merely a virtual twin of your existing life. Instead, consider it an array of alternative realities with unexpected possibilities and psychological effects. The Metaverse will change how humans interact with technology, with one another, and with the world. Ultimately, it will even upend the concept of what a world is.\n\nWhy does the Metaverse matter?\n\nIt matters because of the economic value up for grabs. I’ll illustrate with a comparison.\n\nThe advent of the Internet made most industries go “digital”. And now, 30 years later, about 15 per cent of the world economy is purely digital, while the remaining 85pc is digitally enhanced. So the Internet’s footprint is everywhere.\n\nExpect the Metaverse to take over the global economy at a comparable rate and in a similar timeframe.\n\nMoreover, if going digital was a big shift, this next one would be even bigger due to the increasing criticality of technology to economic activity. Some expect the Metaverse will generate more than 10 trillion dollars in value and tens of millions of new jobs.\n\nThe economic pie up for grabs is so enormous that the advent of the Metaverse will probably reshuffle the world order — among both the corporate world and governments. Amid this reshuffle will arise an opportunity for a developing country like Pakistan.\n\nPakistan’s entry into the Metaverse\n\nWhenever something has a strong demand, those best positioned to supply it get rewarded handsomely. So it pays to position yourself for a future that is approaching. This fundamental principle turned around the fortunes of many countries during the digital revolution — India and China being two notable examples from Pakistan’s neighbourhood.\n\nMany years ago, I proposed a menu of ambitious tech-related suggestions to Pakistani decision-makers. But my proposal was too expansive, requiring a lot of bandwidth and resources. Pakistan was not ready for it (nor is it ready yet). So taking note of that, I’ve tweaked my doctrine. I now believe Pakistan should consciously pull back and refocus exclusively on technologies shaping the future. Otherwise, it will be spreading itself too thin. In essence, being lightweight and focused is the need of the hour.\n\nSo in light of that, here are some suggestions for the Pakistani state:\n\nCreate a think tank: The state must understand more about the Metaverse before it can make effective policies. So first up, a dedicated think tank is needed. It will enable the government to consult relevant experts without exhaustive red tape. The think tank’s research and recommendations will help the state thoughtfully formulate an official policy.\n\nThe state must understand more about the Metaverse before it can make effective policies. So first up, a dedicated think tank is needed. It will enable the government to consult relevant experts without exhaustive red tape. The think tank’s research and recommendations will help the state thoughtfully formulate an official policy. Formulate a Metaverse policy: Why is this policy needed? Firstly, to take advantage of the upcoming Metaverse economy. Secondly, to regulate virtual experiences that could have harmful psychosomatic effects (for example, porn in virtual reality). And thirdly, to address data collection, usage, rights, and penalties. The Metaverse will capture much more user data than social media. Cameras, microphones, and sensors will record nearly every movement, every word, every expression, and much more in the Metaverse. Pakistan needs a Metaverse policy right away, before tech giants swoop in and goad government officials into signing contracts that enslave Pakistan’s virtual future on the pretext of globalisation.\n\nWhy is this policy needed?

Incentivise service providers: Pakistan has a growing community of tech service providers. Their primary bread and butter is building websites and apps for foreign clients. Through sweeteners, the state can incentivise this developer community to start compiling a portfolio of Metaverse projects. This way, a critical mass of Pakistani service providers will ultimately attune themselves to the Metaverse tech stack, helping the country build a competitive advantage over time.\n\nPakistan has a growing community of tech service providers.

This way, a critical mass of Pakistani service providers will ultimately attune themselves to the Metaverse tech stack, helping the country build a competitive advantage over time. Align academia: Huge advances in computational resources, blockchains, bandwidth, networking, and AI-based optimisations are needed to make the Metaverse possible. Likewise, expertise in 3D and VR modelling, animations, and using APIs to create immersive 3D experiences is also growing in demand. Pakistani university curriculum and research should nurture these competencies among scholars. Accordingly, technology universities can be mandated to offer relevant courses, or at least one ‘Metaverse 101’ course. In case of a shortage of competent professors, a suitable online course or seminar can be made compulsory (for example, Stanford’s). A small start like this can someday snowball into a more meaningful curriculum upgrade as the Metaverse matures in the future.\n\nI’ve deliberately kept these recommendations simple and low-fidelity. Expecting costly overhauls is unrealistic, given Pakistan’s economic travails. So let’s take baby steps first and delay significant strides for later.\n\nMetaverse use cases for Pakistan\n\nSo which industries in Pakistan can benefit the most from Metaverse-related technology? An obvious answer is game development startups from Pakistan’s tech sector. But what about beyond the obvious? Let’s explore:\n\nEducation: Covid-19 enforced ‘Zoom School’ on the world, but we soon realised it couldn’t replace presence in the classroom. That’s where the Metaverse shines. Immersive virtual reality transcends video calls, making your dominant senses feel you are present in the virtual experience. I’ve seen jaws drop when people experience this for the first time. So making use of this effect, top-tier Pakistani universities can introduce a course or two taught directly in VR. For example, it could be a course with guest lecturers from around the world, giving unforgettably immersive, interactive lectures to scholars. Note that entry-level VR devices cost roughly as much as mid-range smartphones. So it isn’t unthinkable for top-tier Pakistani universities, colleges, or schools to procure a dozen VR devices for learning. In the short run, this move will differentiate these institutions from their competition. But in the long run, this will lay the foundation for such institutions to leverage the Metaverse in unforeseen ways.\n\nCovid-19 enforced ‘Zoom School’ on the world, but we soon realised it couldn’t replace presence in the classroom.

But in the long run, this will lay the foundation for such institutions to leverage the Metaverse in unforeseen ways. Real estate: The best way to illustrate this is via an example. In July, UAE’s largest real estate company Damac declared a $100 million investment in Metaverse technology. Damac’s GM explained the rationale behind this investment: “we sell AED 100 million monthly over Zoom calls without any immersive technology. With the Metaverse, we can sell AED 700-800 million a month to customers in California, New York, or Miami”. This rationale also partly applies to Pakistan, given how hungry Pakistan’s real estate sector is for overseas investment.\n\nThe best way to illustrate this is via an example.

We’re already seeing virtual fashion brands like ‘dressx’ making a mark and virtual influencers like ‘lilmiquela’ playing muse to fashion houses on Instagram. Pakistan has a burgeoning fashion scene, with designers gaining international traction over the years. Expanding into virtual fashion and influencers will open up new revenue streams for such designers, helping create a reputation for innovation among their international clientele.\n\nAs the Metaverse takes off, so will virtual fashion.

Defence and security: Pakistan has an established combat aircraft programme with a growing export market that virtual reality simulators will further stimulate. Equally, engineers at organisations such as the Institute of Optronics would do well to integrate augmented reality (AR) capabilities in the night and thermal vision gear they’re developing. There’s also massive potential for AR-enriched training systems, ranging from traditional combat training to anti-terrorism exercises. The tech created will eventually have export potential, apart from virtuously spilling over to the local economy. I realise that military research is classified; perhaps the Pakistani defence sector is already working on these concepts.\n\nPakistan has an established combat aircraft programme with a growing export market that virtual reality simulators will further stimulate.

I realise that military research is classified; perhaps the Pakistani defence sector is already working on these concepts. Tourism: Imagine 3D videos and immersive VR that depict flying like a bird over valleys in Gilgit-Baltistan, virtually climbing Himalayan peaks, or experiencing the best camping sites in Pakistan. Such technology will let anyone in the world experience a slice of Pakistan’s natural beauty from the comfort of their home. Marketing like that will naturally pique a lot of interest and vigorously feed Pakistan’s tourism. Remember that tourism promotion is usually tax-funded, so the government must take the lead and engage private sector solution providers for such Metaverse projects.\n\nCrisis relief: Pakistan is no stranger to natural disasters and humanitarian crises. Donations are critical in such cases; however, donor fatigue is increasing by the day. The Metaverse can help with this. It can allow potential donors experience the horrors of the calamity firsthand as if they are there. Grab a VR headset and experience life in a Syrian refugee camp via Clouds over Sidra to see what I mean. There is currently a growing body of academic work and psychology experiments that verify the empathy-inducing effects of this technology. Pakistani disaster relief operators should take note.\n\nPakistan is no stranger to natural disasters and humanitarian crises.

There is currently a growing body of academic work and psychology experiments that verify the empathy-inducing effects of this technology. Pakistani disaster relief operators should take note. Skills training: Be it professional sportsmen, medical staff, machine operators, or health and safety professionals, high-quality training is a vital ingredient for productivity and excellence. The Metaverse can facilitate such training effectively while offering substantial time and cost savings. For instance, imagine virtual training for handling rare but costly scenarios in factories or facing a thousand virtual bouncers from the world’s fastest bowler to perfect your hook shot. Through such immersive training, PSL franchises, manufacturing plants, hospitals, and retail corporations can all level up. The tech is available now. It’s not science fiction.\n\nThe above isn’t an exhaustive list of suggestions; it’s more intended to stimulate minds and get the ball rolling.\n\nForming a consensus\n\nThis article means nothing if it cannot spur action. Yet, pessimism has so overtaken the zeitgeist that the Metaverse sounds like a distant dream for affluent times.\n\nHowever, we must realise that the world always tends to gravitate toward chaos. It’s a law of nature. There will never be a “perfect time”. Instead, Pakistan will need to consciously, effortfully turn the tide, one step at a time. The tide won’t turn automagically.\n\n“We can’t even make bicycles”. That sounds like a Pakistani quote, but it was in fact muttered by a prominent Israeli parliamentarian in 1951, who used the faltering bicycle industry to criticise a proposal to establish a futuristic Israeli aerospace company. Although it was deemed unrealistic, the proposal somehow went through.\n\nAs a result, the Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) was born. Today, IAI is one of Israel’s biggest employers. It has helped the country evolve from a land that could not manufacture bicycles to being one of the largest exporters of technology in the world. Big things have small beginnings.\n\nPakistan itself is no stranger to humble origins. The evolution of its nuclear programme is a testament to Pakistanis innovating when pushed against the wall.\n\nInternally, Pakistan’s nuclear programme mostly had broad support, cutting through egos, party lines, and civil-military friction. Key stakeholders wanted to get it done by hook or crook, no matter what it took. Why? Because the existential threats they faced brought them clarity. This clarity enabled them to act in unison. And that, in turn, created results greater than the sum of the parts. It’s akin to the physics principle of resonance but played out in the arena of human decision-making.\n\nSo far, innovative technology (such as the Metaverse) is a politically neutral subject in Pakistan. Hence, it can potentially enjoy broad support across the spectrum, like the country’s nuclear programme.\n\nHowever, let’s also be pragmatic. Pakistan remains a patronage economy, where it’s about who you know, not what you know. Cronyism is the name of the game. And the problem with cronyism is that even well-intentioned cronies get caught up in turf wars. The result is politics, not progress.\n\nWhile it remains largely unblemished to date, the adoption of innovative technology in Pakistan can still be toxified by factors such as those mentioned above. If that happens, the country’s technology aspirations will suffer a paralysing deadlock for decades, with another generation or two wasted like cannon fodder. Once humans dive into the rabbit hole of factionalism, common sense evaporates and nightmares come true. Case in point: Covid-19 was politicised in the US, leading to Americans taking their vaccine denialism to the next level, despite suffering the world’s largest tally of Covid deaths. It would be comical if it weren’t so tragic.\n\nIn short, Pakistan must adopt guardrails that ensure innovative technologies like the Metaverse remain insulated from unnecessary politicking and cronyism. It must also wilfully drive an internal consensus on the matter to catch the global trend early. As I said, big things have small beginnings. Such a consensus will pay massive, massive dividends in the future. Time to act now.\n\nFurther reading\n\nYou can stop reading now. But for those curious about the technical specifications of the Metaverse, I’ll indulge some more.\n\nMatthew Ball, a prominent Metaverse thinker and venture capitalist, has formulated perhaps the best definition of the Metaverse. His definition is roughly: “the Metaverse is a collection of 3D virtual worlds that are interoperable and massively scaled, have high concurrency, are synchronous and persistent, and render in real-time”.\n\nLet me explain some of those concepts.\n\nInteroperable: Virtual worlds in the Metaverse will all speak to one another. Practically that means items, progression, and the rules from each world will be recognisable in all other worlds. Without such interoperability, the Metaverse will reduce to a collection of walled gardens without synergies. Although opinions vary, I believe blockchains will play a pivotal role in enabling interoperability.\n\nVirtual worlds in the Metaverse will all speak to one another.

For example, if you disconnected while constructing a building, you won’t start from scratch upon returning. Or if you made a dent in some corner of the world, that dent would stay in perpetuity. Real-time: These worlds and the people in them will react to inputs without perceptible lag.\n\nOur civilisation has advanced to the point where the above specifications don’t seem outlandish science fiction. Indeed we are already seeing glimpses of these capabilities in much of the current technology. That is why the leading technology thinkers of our age can now sense the Metaverse coming.\n\nGiven the exaggerated hype the term ‘Metaverse’ is seeing in the media, it’s easy to ignore it as another marketing ploy for milking attention. Perhaps the word ‘Metaverse’ will get rebranded in the coming years. But its underlying thesis won’t change. Look under the hood; there’s a ton of substance.\n\nBelieve the hype, prepare yourself, and bide your time. It’s now a question of ‘when’, not ‘if’. The world our children see will be very different from what we see and Pakistan would do well to be a major part of it.\n\nIllustrations by Rare Sense Inc.",

Shelter, clean drinking water and food are among the most urgently needed items in the aftermath of the flood.”\n\nTorrential monsoon rainfall has caused the Indus River to overflow, submerging land for tens of kilometers wide, according to recent images from the European Space Agency.\n\nCrops and livestock have been lost having a significant impact on both livelihood and nutrition of afflicted communities.\n\nWFP/Kapil Dev WFP is on the ground in Sanghar, Sindh, registering those affected by the severe floods for food distribution.\n\n‘Global challenge’\n\n“We have a major problem within the region and a particular global challenge in ensuring that the support that is going to be necessary to get agricultural production back up and running in Pakistan, to feed its own people, as well as being the continued source of supply of food for colleagues and brethren next door in Afghanistan,” alerted Chris Kaye, WFP’s Country Director for Pakistan.\n\nNeighboring Afghanistan has also been hard-hit by the flooding which has come as the country struggles to recover from a series of natural disasters.\n\nMillions have found refuge in Pakistan over the last 40 years, noted Mr. Matthew Saltmarsh. “Pakistan and its people have hosted millions of Afghan refugees for over four decades, with some 1.3 million registered now in the country, as well of course as large numbers of undocumented Afghans.”\n\n© UNICEF/Asad Zaidi A flooded village in Matiari, in the Sindh Province of Pakistan.\n\nClimate change factor\n\nPakistan, which is already facing political and economic turmoil, has been thrown into the front line of the human-induced climate crisis.

    "None fooled by US call on Pakistan F-16s: EAM S Jaishankar": "Ahead of his meeting with secretary of state Antony Blinken, external affairs minister S Jaishankar has raised questions over the “merits” of the US-Pakistan relationship and asserted that Washington’s ties with Islamabad had not served the “American interest”.He was speaking at an event organised by the Indian American community in Washington on Sunday. The remarks were made when the minister was asked by the audience about the recent US decision to provide a $450 million sustenance package for Pakistan ’s fleet of F-16 fighter jets, overturning a Trump era decision.Referring to the US argument that the package was to fight terrorism, Jaishankar said everybody knew where and against whom F-16 were used. \"You're not fooling anybody by saying these things,\" he said.The US had claimed that the move was not designed as a message to India; rather, it was associated with America's defence partnership with Islamabad which was primarily focused on counterterrorism. Earlier defence minister Rajnath Singh had also lodged his protest with his US counterpart on Washington’s decision.America's relationship with Pakistan has \"not served\" either of the two countries, Jaishankar said. \"Very honestly, it's a relationship that has neither ended up serving Pakistan well, nor serving the American interests. So, it is really for the United States today to reflect on what are the merits of this relationship and what they get by it,\" he said.In yet another message to the US, Jaishankar said India’s dependence on Russian defence equipment and the strong defence ties with Moscow were not because New Delhi did not approach Washington in the past to get those.“From 1965, pretty much for the next 40 years, there was no US defence equipment for India. This was, in fact, a period when the India-Soviet, India-Russia relationship became very strong,” he said recalling: “This was not due to a lack of trying on India’s part. I can vouch for it myself.I’ve had my relatives, my father, my grandfather, they worked with the defence ministry. So, I know first-hand what great efforts were made over those years to try to make the US understand that it was in American interest to have a strong, united, independent, prosperous India.” “At that time, they did not succeed, maybe the state of the world was such,” he noted.“The change that started was really triggered by the nuclear deal that removed a very big obstacle to go forward and then to actually take the relationship to a new level requires leadership in India that did not have reservations.\" “It takes two hands to clap. It was not just that all the problems were on the American side, they were visitations on the Indian side as well,” he said.“So, we also have to address the institutions on our side. I think today, the relationship is on a very different footing. We have the possibility of working together in many more areas, especially the security domain.Some of our major exercises are with the American military. We fly a number of American planes today, the C 17,” the minister said. Blinken will host a dinner in Jaishankar’s honour and hold formal dialogue with him on Tuesday.",

    "Pakistan's prime minister talks Kashmir, floods at UN": "Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nUNITED NATIONS — Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif appealed for a peaceful end to the dispute over Kashmir and deplored regional instability, invoking the perennial themes of Pakistan’s U.N. addresses after dedicating the first half of his speech Friday to the ravages of recent floods. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight The flood-induced devastation, which Sharif described in biblical terms, means it’s incumbent on Pakistan to “ensure rapid economic growth and lift millions out of poverty and hunger,” he said.\n\nBut in order to do so, Sharif said, Pakistan needs a “stable external environment” — that means peace in South Asia, which he said hinges on a resolution of the decadeslong dispute over Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n“At the heart of this longstanding dispute lies the denial of the inalienable right of the Kashmiri people to self-determination,” Sharif said, outlining what he called India’s “relentless campaign of repression” and “serial brutalization” of Kashmiris.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKashmir is divided between India and Pakistan and has been claimed by both since they won independence from the British empire 75 years ago.\n\nSharif accused India of its own colonial ambitions by trying to change Kashmir’s demographics from majority Muslim to majority Hindu. While he described Islamophobia as “a global phenomenon,” he specifically accused India’s Hindu nationalist government of engaging in “the worst manifestation of Islamophobia.”\n\nIndia — which has said Kashmir is an internal matter and one of law and order — is scheduled to speak at the General Assembly on Saturday. Rights groups have accused Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s governing party of looking the other way and sometimes enabling hate speech against Muslims. Modi’s party denies the accusations, but India’s Muslims say attacks against them and their faith have increased sharply.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe two South Asian nations lobbed barbs past one another later in the night, each invoking the right of reply. An Indian diplomat shot back at Sharif by accusing the prime minister of seeking to “obfuscate misdeeds in his own country and to justify actions against India that the world considers unacceptable.”\n\nDuring his afternoon speech, Sharif also spoke at length about regional instability and terrorism — of which he called Pakistan “the principal victim.”\n\nHe presented a marked contrast from his flashy yet conservative predecessor, Imran Khan, who dedicated much of last year’s speech to accusing the United States of victimizing Pakistan. Khan was ousted in April after losing a no-confidence vote.\n\nDressed in a sober business suit instead of Khan’s favored waistcoat-and-salwar-kameez combination, Sharif didn’t once mention the United States by name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was impassioned, at times vigorously tapping the rostrum or demonstratively bringing his fists together, but his words struck a less combative tone.\n\n“Pakistan is a partner for peace,” Sharif said before departing from prepared remarks: “But Mr. President, peace can only be ensured and guaranteed when the rights of communities who have been suffering over decades, and subjugated over decades, earn their freedom and are respected.”\n\nSharif’s speech also represented a departure from last year, when Khan expressed optimism about the then-incipient Taliban rule in Afghanistan and exhorted the General Assembly not to isolate the new government. A year later, no U.N. member state has recognized the Taliban government.\n\n“Pakistan would also like to see an Afghanistan which is at peace with itself and the world, and which respects and nurtures all its citizens, without regard to gender, ethnicity and religion,” he said, avoiding direct mention of its current government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbove all, he echoed a fear common to countries who typically do not dominate the global discourse: “My real worry is about the next stage of this challenge, when the cameras would have gone or left this august assembly and the story just shifts away to conflicts like Ukraine,” he said of the flooding recovery. “My question is, will we be left alone, high and dry?”\n\n___\n\nFor more AP coverage of the U.N.

    "In flood-hit Pakistan, Guterres appeals for ‘massive’ global support, tougher action on climate change": "Pakistan has been inundated with near continuous monsoon rainfall, flash flooding, and rain-induced landslides since mid-June, causing widespread devastation and casualties affecting millions of people across the South Asian country.\n\nUpon his arrival, Mr. Guterres was briefed on the latest developments and the Pakistan-led response by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, as well as other senior members of the Government.\n\nHis two-day visit to the country is not only about solidarity, as he stressed during his various meetings today, “it is [also] a matter of justice”.\n\n“My heart goes out to everyone who has lost loved ones in this tragedy, and all those who have been affected by the loss of their homes, their businesses and their livelihoods” he told journalists in Pakistan’s capital, Islamabad, in a joint press conference alongside Minister of Foreign Affairs Zardari.\n\nUN Photo/Eskinder Debebe Secretary-General António Guterres (right, back to camera) along with Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif of Pakistan visit the National Flood Response and Coordination Centre in Islamabad.\n\n‘A terrifying wall of water’\n\n“[We] have all seen media images of the extraordinary destruction. I can only imagine the power and ferocity of the water as it bore down on villages, roads, bridges and everything else in its path. It was clearly terrifying – a wall of water.” Mr. Guterres said, adding: “No country deserves this fate, but particularly not countries like Pakistan that have done almost nothing to contribute to global warming.”\n\nIndeed, the UN chief stressed that Pakistan and other developing countries – from the Horn of Africa to the Sahel – are paying a horrific price for the intransigence of big emitters that continue to bet on fossil fuels, in the face of science, common sense and basic human decency.\n\nEven today, emissions are rising as people die in floods and famines. “This is insanity,” stated the Secretary-General. “This is collective suicide,” he added, calling for an end to the “war with nature” and urging more investment in renewable energy.\n\nMessage to the Pakistani people, and the world\n\nEarlier in the day, Mr. Guterres met with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, and the two officials visited the National Flood Response and Coordination Centre (NFRCC), established by the Prime Minister on 1 September to synergize the national response to the ongoing floods.\n\nAt the Centre, Mr. Guterres, the Pakistan officials and other in attendance viewed a short video that vividly depicted the scale of devastation wrought by the floods have thus far. Some of the footage showed cars and buildings being swept away by the massive floods. The video also portrayed the heartbreaking situation of women, children and men that have been displaced.\n\nSpeaking directly to the Pakistan people from a podium set up at the Centre: the UN chief said: “I’ve always witnessed your enormous generosity receiving ... Afghan refugees, protecting and assisting them. I've seen your generosity, helping each other, helping family, helping communities... And so, I know what it means for the Pakistani people, this unprecedented natural disaster.”\n\nHe reassured the Pakistani people that “we will do everything possible to mobilize the international community to support your country and to support all of you in this dramatic situation, in which beyond the numbers, I see families that lost their loved ones, I see families that lost their houses I see families that lost their crops, that lost their jobs and that are living in desperate conditions.\n\nThe Secretary-General stressed that he had also seen “the enormous effort of response from civil servants, the Government, from the Army, from the NGOs, from the population in an extraordinary demonstration of solidarity within the borders of Pakistan.”\n\n© WFP/Saiyna Bashir Starting mid-June 2022, flooding and landslides caused by heavy monsoon rainfall have brought widespread destruction across Pakistan.\n\n‘Nature is striking back’\n\nSpeaking next directly to the international community, Mr. Guterres said: “Pakistan needs massive financial support to respond to this crisis that have costed, according to some estimates that I’ve heard today, about $30 billion and counting.”&\n\nHe stressed that it is essential that this is recognized by the international community especially by those countries that have contributed more to climate change. He urged that “effective solidarity and effective justice” be shown by mobilizing massive support for relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction.\n\nHe warned that “we are heading into a disaster...we have waged war on nature, and nature is striking back, and striking back in a devastating way.”\n\nUN Photo/Eskinder Debebe Secretary-General António Guterres (left) meets with Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif of Pakistan.\n\nGovernment ‘working together’ at all levels\n\n“It is a matter of great encouragement you brought with you” the Prime Minister told Mr. Guterres at the NFRCC.\n\nHe reiterated that the Government of Pakistan, along with provincial governments and all of stakeholders including the armed forces, are all working together to provide relief and help rescue to millions of people in need.\n\nAccording to the Government, some 33 million people are absolutely in dire conditions. “As we speak, people are being removed to safe places, food and shelter being offered,” said Prime Minister Sharif.\n\nScale of needs is enormous\n\n“As you stand here today, a third of my country's landmass is underwater,” Foreign Minister Zardari said. “Our people have lost their lives, their livelihoods, they are facing a very real threat of hunger, disease, and further devastation.”\n\nHe noted that his party’s slogan is food, clothing and shelter. “I cannot shelter 33 million families. I cannot provide the food and clothing for 35 million families.”\n\nThe Government is also considering all the work to be done after the waters recede, such as rebuilding houses and schools and infrastructure. “We know that we cannot do this alone, but we will do this together.”\n\nHe affirmed confidence in the United Nations, and in their international partners who “will not leave us in our difficult times, and we will build Pakistan back and build back better.”\n\nClimate change affecting Pakistan\n\nMr. Guterres reminded the world that the level of emissions of Pakistan is relatively low, “but Pakistan is one of the most dramatically impacted countries by the climate change” calling the floods a product of “the intensification of climate change”\n\nPakistan is consistently ranked among the 10 most vulnerable countries to the effects of global climate change, with impacts largely felt along the Indus River’s massive and regionally vital irrigation system.\n\nHaving already seen an average temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius over the last century and witnessing highly erratic and extreme weather events over the last decade, Pakistan's vulnerability to the climate challenge is expected to become more severe in the future.\n\nThe Secretary General warned that loss and damage from the climate crisis is not a future event, “it is happening now, all around us,” and he urged governments to address this issue at COP 27 with the seriousness it deserves.\n\n© WFP/Balach Jamali WFP distribute food for communities affected by monsoon floods in Balochistan, Pakistan.\n\nMeeting with UN Country Team\n\nJoined by Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Martin Griffiths, and Resident Coordinator, Julien Harneis, Mr. Guterres began his first day in Islamabad meeting the UN country team in Pakistan. He was briefed by UN agencies regarding the response in the country, and their needs.\n\nOn Saturday, the UN chief will see the impact of the floods in different areas of the country, as some regions have experienced their wettest August on record. Rainfall in some provinces was up to eight times higher than usual.\n\nHe pointed out that the United Nations is on the ground to support the Pakistani Government’s relief efforts.\n\n“We and civil society are making good use of the funds released from the UN’s Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF),” Mr. Guterres confirmed, adding that the United Nations is stepping up efforts with the use of an air bridge from Dubai.\n\n“Our people have delivered food or cash assistance to hundreds of thousands of people in Balochistan and Sindh, tons of emergency supplies to support children and women,” he said. “but what we have done is a drop in the ocean of the needs of the Pakistani people.”\n\nHundreds of thousands of displaced people are living in camps, and many more – six million as far as he knew – are with host communities.\n\nThe Secretary-General is leaving vibrant Islamabad and heading to the south, where tomorrow he will see first-hand the damage caused by the floods. He is also expected to meet with displaced people and first responders, as well as women health workers and nurses.",
    "Ex-Pakistan PM Imran Khan apologises in contempt of court case": "Pakistan court defers contempt proceedings against the PTI chief after he says he is willing to apologise to the female judge.\n\nIslamabad, Pakistan – A court in Pakistan has deferred contempt proceedings against former Prime Minister Imran Khan after he said he was willing to apologise for his remarks against a female judge.\n\n“If the court wants, I will go to the lady judge and apologise to her. I will never say anything that will hurt the feelings of the court or judiciary,” Khan told the Islamabad High Court during a hearing on Thursday.\n\n“I assure the court I will not do something like this in future,” he said. “I am sorry if I crossed a red line.”\n\nKhan was charged with contempt of court following a speech he made at a public rally in capital Islamabad on August 20, where he threatened “action” against Judge Zeba Chaudhry and senior Islamabad police officials for arresting his top aide Shahbaz Gill.\n\nFollowing remarks made during a TV show, Gill was charged with attempting to incite a mutiny in Pakistan’s powerful military, an allegation Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party denies.\n\nIf convicted, Khan risked being disqualified from holding a public post for at least five years, according to Pakistan’s laws.\n\nFollowing Khan’s apology, the court decided to not indict the cricketing icon-turned-politician, asking him to submit his statement in an affidavit before the next hearing on October 3.\n\nEarlier this week, the same court also dropped terrorism charges against the 69-year-old politician for his remarks during the Islamabad rally.\n\nThe former Pakistani leader is also facing a case related to alleged foreign funding for his PTI party. The next hearing in the case is on November 6.\n\nKhan’s government was removed through a parliamentary vote of no-confidence in April this year.\n\nSince then, he has been holding public rallies across the country, demanding new elections, which are otherwise due late next year.\n\n“Today, he (Khan) was far more contrite in person compared to his submitted replies, which seemed to have satisfied the bench,” lawyer Munir A Malik, an amicus curiae (court assistant) in the contempt case, told Al Jazeera.\n\nLahore-based political analyst Mehmal Sarfraz says Khan had no option but to apologise in the contempt case.\n\n“He knew that he must tender an unconditional apology. The court even gave him a couple of opportunities earlier, but his replies failed to satisfy the court,” she told Al Jazeera.\n\nPTI leader Faisal Javed Khan said Khan has always spoken about the supremacy of law and judiciary.\n\n“Imran Khan’s stance since day one has been the same. The court’s decision will hopefully come in his favour,” he told Al Jazeera.",

    "Pakistan’s Scramble for a Peaceful and Stable Afghanistan": "The country’s initial euphoria at the Taliban victory has given way to concern as several troubling developments threaten its regional interests.\n\nPakistan and Taliban flags flutter on their respective sides while people walk through a security barrier to cross border at a key border crossing point between Pakistan and Afghanistan, in Chaman, Pakistan, Aug. 18, 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough stability is gaining ground in Afghanistan, challenges remain as the economy and people’s livelihoods are facing serious difficulties. These developments hold ramifications for the world, yet regional countries will be most heavily impacted by any development in Afghanistan – and none more than Pakistan, because of its geographical proximity and historical and cultural links.\n\nCircumstances have changed since the initial euphoria that Pakistan enjoyed after the Taliban won power in August 2021, because of Islamabad’s expectation that the regime change spelled an uncertain future for India in Afghanistan. Several challenges still exist in Afghanistan-Pakistan relations.\n\nThe first major concern is Pakistan’s security fence along the border, which has caused quarrels. Historically, Afghanistan has called the Durand Line an artificial border imposed by the British. Such views are present irrespective of the faction that is in power in Afghanistan. Against such loud reiterations, Pakistan has vowed to resolve the issue diplomatically. Still, the Taliban’s interim government has remained reluctant to accept the Durand Line as the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. The dispute persists even though the Taliban’s major interests are inevitably linked to Pakistan, be it efforts for recognition of the government, trade, or humanitarian assistance.\n\nThere have been recurring reports of Afghan security forces damaging Pakistan’s border fencing, calling it illegal. For instance, most recently, Enayatullah Khwarazmi, the spokesman of Afghanistan’s Ministry of Defense, said Pakistan has “no right” to separate Pashtuns living on either side of the Durand Line.\n\nDiplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. Get the Newsletter\n\nThe development has raised alarm bells for Pakistan. The ISPR’s director general, Maj. Gen. Babar Iftikhar, expressed a commitment that the fencing would be completed as planned, because “blood of martyred soldiers has been spilled while erecting the fence.”\n\nEnjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.\n\nThe border issue has remained a point of contention for decades, but there are even more pressing challenges.\n\nThe second major concern is that ever since the Taliban’s takeover, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has resurfaced with renewed political strength coupled with improved internal cohesion, thus raising eyebrows in Islamabad as the insurgents bring splintered factions back into the fold. Coupled with this development is the possibility of TTP cooperation with the Afghan Taliban. With the Taliban emboldened by the fall of Kabul, it is not an exaggeration to say that the TTP’s strong yet low-profile presence in Pakistan could act as a Trojan horse for Afghanistan in Pakistan. After all, TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud has pledged allegiance to Maulvi Hibatullah Akhundzada, the Afghan Taliban leader. So, the Taliban know that they can use the leverage of the TTP, a self-declared branch of the Taliban in Pakistan, to receive benefits from Pakistan. The TTP remains one of the most dangerous interregional terrorist threats to Pakistan.\n\nAdditionally, the Taliban government has released scores of TTP commanders in recent times, including former deputy chief Maulvi Faqir Muhammed. Such a gamble from the Taliban government would fray Pakistan’s support for a stable Afghanistan, especially if the security circles see a constructive resurfacing of militancy in Swat that undermines the decade-long counterinsurgency efforts by the Pakistan Army to oust the TTP. This could be one of the reasons why Pakistan reportedly (though it was never confirmed) carried out airstrikes in eastern Afghanistan, thereby sending a message to the Afghan government not to shelter militants on their soil.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPakistan has tried to open negotiations with TTP, yet Islamabad has failed to subdue the terrorist group’s rise in northwestern Pakistan. One reason for the failure is because Pakistan has tried to use the same strategy – for instance, the release of 90 TTP militants in 2021 – so that the negotiations continue, yet after a temporary ceasefire, the TTP resumes attacks. Such tactics are employed to gain momentum and remain an important tactic for “regrouping” and for securing the release of imprisoned senior leaders, thus improving the TTP’s position.\n\nThe third major concern is linked to Pakistan’s ambitions to link South Asia with Central Asia to promote regional connectivity, development, and the flow of energy from Central Asia toward Pakistan. Such ambitions can only be materialized if Afghanistan remains stable, as several projects between the two regions pass through Afghanistan’s north. Therefore, the future of several of Pakistan’s Vision Central Asia-inspired projects with the Central Asian States, including the TAPI and CASA 1000, depends on peace and stability in Afghanistan – a conflict-prone country.\n\nAfghanistan’s north is still subject to challenges from the Islamic State of Khorasan as well as Tajik and Uzbek militants. Several factions in Afghanistan are not willing to accept the Taliban’s rule. There are reports of challenges to the interim government, for instance, from the Islamic State, Uzbek resistance in Faryab province, Hazaras in Balkhab district led by Mawlawi Mehdi Mujahid, Tajiks in Parwan province led by Afghan Army chief Mohammad Yasin Zia, and Ahmad Masood’s forces, who are challenging the Taliban-led status quo in Afghanistan.\n\nThe fourth concern for Pakistan is the recognition of the Taliban’s interim government in Afghanistan, which for the global audience remains a pariah regime. Seemingly, the world is reluctant to pursue constructive engagement with the Taliban, based on global powers’ common calls for inclusivity in governance, women’s rights, and counterterrorism. Islamabad, however, remains committed to showing the world that the way forward is to move beyond such rhetorical arguments. If the great powers want to pressure Afghanistan, then they should constructively engage by incentivizing the Afghan government and then asking for compliance with international standards of governance.\n\nThat said, unless the world softens its stance on the interim government, Pakistan will remain hesitant to recognize the Taliban. Doing so unilaterally that could harm Pakistan’s already strained relations with the West and could lead to the threat of sanctions. For now, policy pundits in Pakistan are clear that the new Afghan government is a reality that must be recognized by the world. Pakistan’s foreign policy line remains close to what Uzbekistan’s President Shavkat Mirziyoyev said regarding recognition of the Taliban government: “We see no other option. We share a border, deep history and culture.”\n\nOnly time will tell how many other regional stakeholders will resonate with Mirziyoyev’s views. Until then, Pakistan, together with Afghanistan’s neighboring partners, is urging international actors to engage with the Taliban, because it does not want Afghanistan to become a cordon sanitaire for Pakistan’s relations with the West.\n\nPakistan’s position seems clear: Any true help for the Afghan people can hardly materialize if one bypasses the interim government of Afghanistan. But even as Pakistan scrambles to boost the prospects of a peaceful and stable Afghanistan by convincing the world to interact with the Afghan government, Islamabad finds itself facing several challenges from ongoing developments in Afghanistan. These challenges have led to mutual disdain, but cooperation between the two nations must take precedence.",
    "Pakistan wrestle over weightlifting administration. Two sporting bodies fighting for control amidst allegations of corruption": "Despite two different sporting bodies vying to run weightlifting in Pakistan, the International Weightlifting Federation has decided to let the dispute continue for now and has backed the existing body, which is being challenged by a government-backed organisation. While one body, the current sports authority of the sport in Pakistan, holds a letter from the IWF backing them, the other body has been approved by the Pakistan Sports Board (PSB).\n\nThe argument being made by the government-backed sports board is that rampant corruption has taken place in the current weightlifting organisation and this move will allow for a fresh start.\n\nHafiz Zafar Iqbal, a former national champion who was appointed to the interim committee, said to Insidethegames.biz, “The intention of the PWLF is to protect the corrupt, while the PSB has acted to maintain discipline, as a controlling body of sports in Pakistan.”\n\nMeanwhile the Pakistan Weightlifting Federation (PWLF) has said that the sole intention of PSB has been to take over the Pakistan Olympic Association and this is a move towards making that a reality. PWLF chief Hafiz Imran Butt said that there is no law or validity of the PSB taking over weightlifting in the country, in this manner.\n\n“The PWLF is not a banned federation and is working under its own constitution and under the constitutions of the POA and the IWF – and none of them has banned the PWLF. The PSB was created to provide infrastructure to National Federations, which it is not doing. The dispute has been created by the PSB just to put, by force, a few retired army friends at the helm of affairs of a properly constituted weightlifting federation,” said Butt.\n\nThe Pakistan Sports Board on the other hand, said that the PWLF were directly responsible for the doping violations that have occurred in the past months. Pakistani weightlifter Talha Talib tested positive twice in November and December along with six other team members who had been provisionally suspended for doping violations. Four of those violations were based on samples not being provided.\n\nIqbal said that three of these six violations were made by the three sons of Amjad Amin Butt, the vice president and former secretary of PWLF. He then added that in the two other violations, the coach of both players was Irfan Butt, the son of PWLF president Hafiz Imran Butt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I fail to understand how the POA and PWLF managed to deceive the IWF and fetch a letter in favour of the suspended President. I would request the IWF to review its decision and withdraw support of Hafiz Imran Butt until finality of the inquiry,” said Iqbal.\n\nIrrespective of where Pakistan weightlifting goes, their current bleak circumstances are compounded by the fact that they most likely face a ban from the sport for multiple doping violations and are most likely not going to be able to participate at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games.",

At their start, they needed 33 runs from 18 balls to beat Pakistan’s 166, and were relying on Liam Dawson and Adil Rashid to do it against Mohammad Hasnain, who had already taken two for 16 with some wickedly quick bowling. They say heroes can be found in the most unlikely places, but outside of Dawson’s home village of Goatacre, there cannot have been many people watching who expected what happened next.\n\nDawson walloped a six down the ground, then glanced a four to third man off a no-ball, he stuck the free hit through mid-wicket, uppercut the next over the slips, and glanced the fifth through square leg. By the time he had taken a single off the final delivery, he’d hit 24 runs off the over, which was one more than he had scored in his 10 previous T20 innings for England. “I think that took everyone by surprise,” said the head coach, Matthew Mott. “I don’t think in our wildest dreams we ever imagined we would end up in that position.”\n\nThe National Stadium was awfully quiet now. A lot of the 30,000 people who had spent the evening screaming and cheering were already leaving because England needed only nine from the final 12 balls. Dawson scored four of them off the second ball of Haris Rauf’s over. Then the game turned again.\n\nRauf bounced Dawson, who was so amped up that he tried to pull the ball and was caught at short mid-wicket, a shot he replayed endlessly when he was back off the pitch. In came Olly Stone, with five needed, and then out he went again, bowled by his first delivery. Rauf’s hat-trick ball was a 96mph yorker which almost had Reece Topley lbw.\n\nPakistan celebrate winning the fourth T20 to level the series. Photograph: Anjum Naveed/AP\n\nThe people making to leave turned right back round into the ground, where they pressed up close against the mesh fence. Topley, all elbows and knees, took a leg bye which left him facing at the start of Mohammad Wasim’s final over with four runs needed. Rashid, desperate to get on strike, was almost run out off the first delivery, and then Topley, beaten home by Shan Masood’s underarm throw, actually was off the second. Karachi erupted in celebration while, among the English players slumped by the boundary-side, Dawson was utterly distraught.\n\nMott was not. “It was a knife-edge game and we’ll draw plenty from it,” he said. “It was a fantastic opportunity to see how we handled ourselves under pressure and I thought we did a good job of it.” It did not look as if they would get so close. Pakistan’s total was built around another large opening stand from Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan, who put on 97 together.\n\nSign up to The Spin Free weekly newsletter Subscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s action Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While the two of them were together, England, who had brought in Stone for Mark Wood and David Willey for Sam Curran, looked pretty powerless to do anything about it.\n\nThen Azam was caught at mid-wicket trying to sweep Rashid, and the game slowed right down again, as if, having built the platform, Pakistan’s batsmen wanted to stop a tea break before they put it to use. Rizwan and Masood, who was badly dropped by Alex Hales, scored only three boundaries between them in the next six overs. It took a couple of hefty late blows from Asif Ali in the last over to satisfy the crowd’s incessant cries of: “We want sixers! We want sixers!”\n\nThe modest total receded into the distance when England’s top order collapsed in a heap. They were 14 for three after 12 deliveries and Harry Brook and Ben Duckett were back together again. Duckett, who continues to bat like a man who has spent three years waiting for his opportunity, began to claw England forwards with a flurry of fours off Wasim. Then Brook pressed on with Moeen Ali. They both hit glorious sixes off Mohammad Nawaz, but he got his revenge by bowling Ali as he charged down the wicket. Brook was caught at fine leg and in came Dawson, for the start of that extraordinary final few overs.\n\nThe series moves to Lahore with the scores tied two-all. England should get stronger as the week goes on, with Jos Buttler, Wood, and Chris Woakes all set to come back into the team. If Pakistan play like this again, they will need to be.",
    "Pakistan in limbo amid power struggle of former PM and deep state": "On Dec. 18, 2010, during a live interview at the Islamabad Press Club, the late Director-General of Pakistan's intelligence services Hamid Gul casually affirmed that “no one becomes the Chief of Army Staff in Pakistan without the U.S.' approval.”\n\nEver since, every now and then, those words come back to haunt the political and military dispensation in Pakistan. Granted, this accusation is not new. It was always understood by uninhibited political analysts that Pakistan's formidable military rules the roost and to varying levels is in a tug-of-war with the United States hegemony. Of course, the level of influence, or give and take, vis-à-vis the U.S. has always been open for debate. It depends on who is leading the military establishment and how willing the powers are to antagonize their own people to oblige their purported benefactors in pursuit of their interests.\n\nAfter the removal of former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan from power by a dubious vote of no-confidence, this old debate has resurfaced. As such, many are asking “who controls Pakistan?” After all, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Donald Lu allegedly demanded the removal of Khan.\n\nSince then, the country has been in a dizzying decline – skyrocketing energy prices, economic collapse, an unprecedented level of popular revolt and the worst flooding the country has seen in the last 50 years.\n\nMeanwhile, the circus plays to its own choir while the country plunges into crisis.\n\nPakistan's current government has charged Khan as a terrorist. What makes this particularly outrageous is that the allegation of terrorism against Pakistan's most popular political leader is led by an illegitimate government, many of whom face serious allegations of financial impropriety and are out on bail. But Khan is not backing down.\n\nEndless tussle of the core, periphery\n\nAmerican sociologist Immanuel Wallerstein, in his World-System Theory, describes global order as the unequal distribution of power between the core – mainly the \"West,\" the semi-periphery countries and the periphery countries of the global south.\n\nThe reach of the “core” is able to influence the internal political structures of the periphery through locally kept leaders – be they in the political, economic, military, or judicial spheres. This leads to the untiring tussle in every post-colonial society between those who wish to facilitate the emergence of representative governance and those against it. On the one side, there are those who are the facilitators of the empire or the proprietors of the core. They excuse their betrayal with such gobbledygook as “enlightened moderation.” Then, they enrich themselves while lamenting punitive austerity measures on their populace since “beggars cannot be choosers.”\n\nOn the other side, there are those who aim to seize the instruments of state power away from those beholden to market fundamentalism or global hegemony. They seek genuine freedom. This unforgiving rivalry is real and goes to the crux of the conflict over state power. It is brutal and further compounded by people of varying interests/motivations vying for their own space. Many do not want to get involved or have lost hope for change. That is, until now.\n\nAfter being unceremoniously and arguably unlawfully removed from office, Khan has politicized his entire country. Yet, his will, commitment and perseverance have energized people like never before; he has made clear who stands on what side of the political spectrum and his pushback has overwhelmed the deep state.\n\nThis privileged class loathes their compatriots and rules only to institutionalize cronyism, inequality and corruption. This rationalization is required in order to purposively obstruct social development, stifle creativity and mock the ethical values and moral moorings of their own people.\n\nA further psychological aspect of these unrepresentative elites and their political cronies is that they embody some of the worst Islamophobic tendencies. It is more insidious since it occurs inside Muslim majority polities and is done by those who ostensibly claim to be Muslims. Despite that, Khan is deftly maneuvering and has swept by-elections in Pakistan's Punjab province by taking 15 out of 20 constituencies and won another by-election in Karachi. This is a remarkable feat and underlines that one can own all the institutions they want, but it is people that matter. If anything, Imran Khan's victory against the deep state, foreign interference and corrupt political parties is stunning.\n\nKashmir issue\n\nConcerning Kashmir, there will be no meaningful commitment until a semblance of political stability returns to Pakistan and legitimate representatives wrest power away from those with questionable integrity. Even worse, there are open discussions from the government of Pakistan opening trade links and working on the infamous \"Musharraf\" (country's former military ruler Gen. Pervez Musharraf) formula which is essentially maintaining the status quo and accepting the current cease-fire line as a porous border.\n\nAn Indian paramilitary soldier stands guard as a Kashmiri girl watches from a doorway during a strike in Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir, April 23, 2010. (AP Photo)\n\nIt must be recalled that the deep state in India refused this bargain, as well as Kashmiris. Hence, most Kashmiris inside Indian-occupied Kashmir and those working in the diaspora communities recognize that only a free, independent Pakistan will genuinely support its liberation movement. At the same time, the Kashmiri diaspora must develop a sophisticated approach to its global resistance while recognizing Pakistan's internal challenges and redlines without ceding control of the resistance to those who may bargain away their future, as those puppet Rajas (kings) in Pakistan have forsaken their own.\n\nThroughout the broader post-Arab Spring, the Middle East, of which Pakistan is part and parcel, the counter-revolutionary forces operate in conjunction with the deep state and global hegemony. That internal deep state, whether in the form of political parties, judiciary, police or military, undermines the emergence of representative democracy, human rights and the rule of law. Institutions are compromised, parliamentarians are bought, and courts are open at midnight to hear cases and enforce their will over parliamentary supremacy to protect the deep state elites' ill-gotten wealth and dubious fiefdoms.\n\nOne could reasonably argue that the deep state looks upon emerging democratic forces that challenge the status quo with both amusement and disdain. It will never willfully forgo the reins of power. However, it will do one better: Make space for emerging political forces to enter the political arena, then slowly undermine them.\n\nIn fact, the carrot of giving power is slowly weaponized to strip away at their aura, heighten instability, and spread fake news of \"nothing being done.\" This character assassination is subtle and meant to slowly undermine the emerging recalcitrant political order to make it a spent force. That is happening in emerging grassroots movements in the Middle East and is attempting to be done to Khan. So far, though, it has not worked.\n\nThere are many among the Pakistani people who support Khan and his team, and this is a promising development for both Pakistanis and Kashmiris.",
    "Angelina Jolie visits Pakistan to support communities affected by devastating floods": "International humanitarian Angelina Jolie is visiting Pakistan to support communities affected by the devastating floods. Heavy rains and floods across the country have impacted 33 million people and submerged one third of the country under water. Ms Jolie is visiting to witness and gain understanding of the situation, and to hear from people affected directly about their needs, and about steps to prevent such suffering in the future.\n\nMs Jolie, who previously visited victims of the 2010 floods in Pakistan, and the 2005 earthquake, will visit the IRC’s emergency response operations and local organisations assisting displaced people including Afghan refugees.\n\nPakistan, which has contributed just 1% of global carbon emissions, is also the second largest host of refugees globally, its people having sheltered Afghan refugees for over forty years.\n\nMs Jolie will highlight the need for urgent support for the Pakistani people and long-term solutions to address the multiplying crises of climate change, human displacement and protracted insecurity we are witnessing globally.\n\nMs Jolie will see first hand how countries like Pakistan are paying the greatest cost for a crisis they did not cause. The IRC hopes her visit will shed light on this issue and prompt the international community - particularly states contributing the most to carbon emissions - to act and provide urgent support to countries bearing the brunt of the climate crisis.\n\nShabnam Baloch, Pakistan Country Director at the IRC said:\n\n“The climate crisis is destroying lives and futures in Pakistan, with severe consequences especially for women and children. The resulting economic loss from these floods will likely lead to food insecurity and an increase in violence against women and girls. We need immediate support to reach people in urgent need, and long term investments to stop climate change from destroying our collective futures. With more rains expected in the coming months, we hope Angelina Jolie’s visit will help the world wake up and take action.”\n\nNotes to Editors\n\nIRC’s latest needs assessment shows people are in urgent need of food, drinking water, shelter, and healthcare. Every person surveyed reported women and girls have no access to menstrual hygiene products. So far, the IRC has reached more than 50,000 women and girls with humanitarian assistance, including dignity and hygiene kits to address the need for sanitation and menstrual items. We have been providing lifesaving services to flood-affected communities in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh since early July and have reached almost 950,000 people with emergency supplies, food, healthcare and safe spaces.",
    "Pakistan and the U.S. Have Made Up, but Will It Last?": "This marks a departure from a year ago, following the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan. Pakistan’s leaders saw the U.S. exit as poorly executed, and senior U.S. officials voiced their frustration at Pakistan for not having brought more weight to bear on the Afghan Taliban to reach a negotiated peace settlement with the former Ashraf Ghani-led government. Subsequent suggestions by U.S. officials that the relationship with Pakistan could be downgraded were viewed in Islamabad as petty punishment: partly for not having done more to help America in Afghanistan and partly for former Prime Minister Imran Khan’s ill-timed visit to Russia on the eve of its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nCalculating the full human and economic cost of Pakistan’s latest climate disaster will take time. But the crisis seems to have provided the Biden administration with the necessary justification for a diplomatic recommitment to the strategically situated, nuclear-armed country.\n\nAs millions of Pakistanis reel from the worst floods in living memory, national and international humanitarian rescue and relief efforts have coincided with a notable political development: a slow-but-steady resumption of high-level contact between Pakistan and the United States.\n\nAs millions of Pakistanis reel from the worst floods in living memory, national and international humanitarian rescue and relief efforts have coincided with a notable political development: a slow-but-steady resumption of high-level contact between Pakistan and the United States.\n\nCalculating the full human and economic cost of Pakistan’s latest climate disaster will take time.

Subsequent suggestions by U.S. officials that the relationship with Pakistan could be downgraded were viewed in Islamabad as petty punishment: partly for not having done more to help America in Afghanistan and partly for former Prime Minister Imran Khan’s ill-timed visit to Russia on the eve of its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBut when Khan began to accuse the United States of trying to engineer regime change in Pakistan, prompting a full-blown political crisis in Islamabad, Washington’s decision to hold off on further engagement became diplomatically prudent rather than vengeful.\n\nKhan has not shied away from cleaving his country’s relationship with the United States and the West more generally. After a no-confidence vote by Pakistan’s opposition parties, the ousted prime minister started staging megarallies across Pakistan’s cities. Despite the country’s worst monsoon in decades, he has continued to foment popular unrest, demonizing the new coalition government that replaced him and accused the Pakistan Army of politicization.\n\nAlthough Khan’s allegations of U.S. regime change are far-fetched, there remains some truth to the claim that it was the Pakistan Army’s withdrawal of its support for Khan that prompted April’s change in government. The Army initially helped pave the way for Khan’s electoral victory in 2018, but it is said to have been increasingly aggravated by the high costs of Khan’s populist politics, which often used anti-American sentiment to whip up domestic support.\n\nIn contrast to Khan, the Pakistan Army sees ties with the United States as central to Pakistan’s geopolitical relevance and key to stabilizing a worsening economy and acute liquidity crisis. To this end, one of the first measures taken by the Shehbaz Sharif-led coalition government that replaced Khan’s was to overturn Khan’s unfunded fuel and electricity subsidies. This was so Pakistan could resume negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), following a seven-month hiatus, over a $6.5 billion program.\n\nFor Washington’s part, in addition to the resumption of the IMF program, there are other signs of a willingness to revive ties. Devastating floods have been accompanied by a flurry of high-profile official visits from Washington: first by State Department counselor Derek Chollet, who announced a 10-day humanitarian air bridge to Pakistan and a $30 million relief package, and then a strategically timed visit by U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator Samantha Power, who took the time to field questions at a press conference in Islamabad to Pakistani journalists. Even though the pretext for the two visits was largely humanitarian in nature, both officials spoke about the significance of 75 years of bilateral relations between the two countries as well as the importance of deepening ties.\n\nAlmost simultaneously, the State Department announced the approval of the potential sale of F-16 aircraft sustainment and related equipment to Pakistan in a deal valued at up to $450 million, with the objective of servicing joint counterterrorism objectives. This decision overturns an earlier decision by the former Trump administration to end the technological and technical support program for the Pakistani fleet. The summer also saw the appointment of a full-time career ambassador to Pakistan after a gap of four years. (The last career ambassador relinquished his charge in 2018.)\n\nIt is virtually impossible to delink the ostensible sea change in America’s willingness to engage with Pakistan to the change in government that transpired this summer. Possibly in a bid to rebuild ties with the Pakistani establishment, Khan is said to now be contemplating softening his party’s extreme stance on the United States. Interestingly enough, it didn’t help that this hard-line position also didn’t sit comfortably with a sizable Pakistani-American diaspora that forms a key part of Khan’s base and which willingly sends remittances back to support the economy. As part of what may be called an internal reset, former U.S. diplomat and lobbyist Robin Raphel met with Khan at his Bani Gala residence this week, albeit in a private capacity. And in an interview to a top television anchor at around the same time, Khan said he was not opposed to Pakistan enjoying a good relationship with the United States, though he added that Pakistan “should not be used like we were used during the war on terror.”\n\nKhan will have to continue to define the parameters of what he considers acceptable in the relationship. In a 2021 television interview, for instance, Khan said Pakistan would “absolutely not” allow the CIA to use bases on its soil for cross-border counterterrorism missions once U.S. forces withdrew from Afghanistan. Although that sentiment is largely shared by parties across the Pakistani political spectrum, high-ranking officials between the two countries have held exploratory discussions about ways to bolster security and counterterrorism mechanisms in the region. It remains to be seen what those mechanisms could look like, but there are a few possibilities. Last month, the United States killed al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in a drone strike in Afghanistan that prompted the Afghan Taliban to accuse Pakistan of allowing its airspace to be used for the strike.\n\nPakistan’s foreign office deftly sidestepped the allegation; still, the resumption of the sale of F-16 spare parts to Pakistan is likely to reinvigorate the conversation around the extent and potential of Pakistani-U.S. counterterrorism cooperation and the Pakistan Army’s willingness to let America back into the country on the ground and in its skies. The Pakistan Army no doubt sees the upside as leveraging counterterrorism cooperation to target Pakistani Taliban militants operating from Afghanistan. The government, meanwhile, would like to maximize international assistance to rebuild Pakistan’s economy and infrastructure devastated by recent and ongoing flooding.\n\nA partnership could potentially have considerable benefits for the United States. By reengaging Pakistan, the United States will diversify its investments in South Asia and in the Indo-Pacific. This may be valuable given India’s insistence that it be allowed to maintain ties with Russia despite the war in Ukraine, which could in time lead some in Washington to privately question India’s long-term reliability as a key American partner in the Indo-Pacific. Although India remains an important partner for the United States for the most part, the United States has been unsuccessful in trying to coax a change in India’s position on Russia. Thus far, U.S. officials have been standing firm on their sale of F-16 spare parts to Pakistan despite criticism from India—signaling perhaps that they too are not averse to hedging.\n\nBack in Pakistan, Khan is savvy enough to recognize a shift in attitudes. It is likely that as temperatures cool and the floodwaters slowly recede, Khan may, somewhat begrudgingly, modulate his anti-U.S. rhetoric. The catch is that Khan actually remains massively popular in Pakistan, and it is widely expected that he will return to power in the next general election—with or without the establishment’s support. A key question for the Pakistan Army, then, is whether it wants Khan in power as a friend or as a foe. The latter would be bad for civil-military relations in the country, and it would also be singularly unhelpful for the country’s longer-term efforts to resuscitate its complicated relationship with America.",
    "WHO Director-General's statement on Pakistan – 17 September 2022": "I am deeply concerned about the potential for a second disaster in Pakistan: a wave of disease and death following this catastrophe, linked to climate change, that has severely impacted vital health systems leaving millions vulnerable. The water supply is disrupted, forcing people to drink unsafe water, which can spread cholera and other diarrhoeal diseases. Standing water enables mosquitoes to breed and spread vector- borne diseases such as malaria and dengue. Health centres have been flooded, their supplies damaged, and people have moved away from home which makes it harder for them to access their normal health services. All this means more unsafe births, more untreated diabetes or heart disease, and more children missing vaccination, to name but a few of the impacts on health.\n\nBut if we act quickly to protect health and deliver essential health services, we can significantly reduce the impact of this impending crisis. Health workers in Pakistan are stretched to the limit as they do all they can to deliver critical services amid the destruction. Nearly 2000 health facilities have been fully or partially damaged. Together with the government of Pakistan, UN and NGO partners, WHO is setting up temporary health facilities and medical camps and helping to re-supply medicines to other health centres. We are increasing disease surveillance so outbreaks can be detected early and people can get the treatment they need.\n\nGovernment and partners are providing safe drinking water and access to toilets to lower the risks of disease from dirty water. WHO has provided water purification kits and oral rehydration salts to manage diarrhoeal diseases. Partners are also helping ensure safer housing and bed nets to protect against mosquitoes and the diseases they carry.\n\nWHO immediately released US$10 million from the WHO Contingency Fund for Emergencies which enabled us to deliver essential medicines and other supplies.\n\nI thank the donors for their prompt response to the flash appeal. We continue to assess the scale of the crisis and will issue a revised appeal shortly. I urge donors to continue to respond generously so that, together, we can save lives and prevent more suffering.",
    "Alt News, Newslaundry come to defend Islamists, claim that Pakistan Zindabad slogans were not raised by PFI supporters": "On September 25, the self-proclaimed fact-checking website Alt News again came to rescue Islamists. This time, they attempted to give clean chit to the Popular Front of India members that were protesting in Pune. As per reports, videos of the protests organized by PFI members in Pune surfaced on social media platforms where they could be heard raising slogans of ‘Pakistan Zindabad.’ As the videos got traction on social media, the obvious saviours of Islamists, including Alt News and Newslaundry, came rushing to their rescue.\n\nAlt News shielded PFI workers raising “Pakistan Zindabad” slogans. Source: Twitter\n\nAlt News propaganda to twist the facts\n\nIn its report, Alt News talked about the protests that took place to oppose the raids by National Investigation Agency (NIA) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) on several locations linked to PFI in 15 states. During these raids, 106 PFI officials and workers were arrested by the investigating agency.\n\nThe protests were organized against the raids and arrests by PFI workers in multiple cities across the country in Pune. In the videos of the Pune protests, the members of PFI were heard raising slogans of ‘Pakistan Zindabad.’ Several netizens and prominent personalities on social media shared the videos and condemned the slogans. OpIndia had also covered the matter.\n\nAlt News, owing to its reputation, could not digest the fact that such slogans were raised. In their “explanation,” the portal said the slogans were not “Pakistan Zindabad” but “Popular Front Zindabad.” They even targeted those who condemned PFI workers for raising the slogans.\n\nThe portal shared a 26-second video and claimed that upon gathering videos from different sources, including journalists on the ground, they “found” that slogans were not “Pakistan Zindabad” but “Popular Front Zindabad.” They also shared a long video version of the protest recorded by Policenama.\n\nThe reality of the slogans\n\nOpIndia re-examined the videos, including the video shared by Policenama. There were multiple slogans that were being raised by the protesters. Among those slogans, ‘Nara-e-Takbeer Allah hu Akbar,’ ‘Popular Front Zindabad,’ and others were included. Now, the question is, was the slogan ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ raised? The answer is yes, the slogan was, in fact, raised.\n\nAt the 7:34 timestamp in the video, the slogan ‘Popular Front Zindabad’ can be easily heard. However, following the said slogan, ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ was also raised by the protesters.\n\nTwitter user Hawk Eye also published the analysis of the video and debunked Alt News claims. In his reply to Alt News, The Hawk Eye published the video compilation at three different speeds. He said, “Sharing the same video in a loop, with 3 different speed variations. The last part is with zoom to read the lip sync. Let ppl decide – “Pakistan” or “Popular front.”\n\nHawk Eye also slowed down the video and zoomed in on the PFI member who was detained by the Police and raised the controversial slogan. It was clearly evident that the slogan was, in fact, ‘Pakistan Zindabad.’\n\nSame vid with audio noise reduction. Observe the audio amplitude variation if its matching with “Pakistan” or “Polular Front”?\n\n2/ pic.twitter.com/YZzcYNWtCv — The Hawk Eye (@thehawkeyex) September 25, 2022\n\nAs there was a lot of background noise in the video, there was still a chance that the likes of Alt News may raise questions over the slogans raised. The Hawk Eye went ahead and cleared the background noise to make it clearer. In the three-speed variants of the audio with reduced background noise, the slogan ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ became more prominent.\n\nNewslaundry’s attempt to shield PFI\n\nA similar “fact-check” was done by the Leftist propaganda website Newslaundry. They quoted Pune Police, suggesting that no such slogans were raised, and shared the same video by Policenama as well. They talked to the protesters as well, who “denied” the allegations of raising ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ slogans.\n\nRJD leader shielded PFI\n\nWhile Alt News and Newslaundry were insisting that ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ slogans were not raised, RJD leader Shivanand Tiwari bluntly supported PFI workers and said such slogans are part of routine protests. He said that ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ slogans raised during a protest in favour of PFI were only a “sign of protest.” Tiwari’s comments came after over a hundred PFI activists were arrested in several states in a nationwide operation on Thursday, after which PFI workers had chanted Pakistan Zindabad slogans in Pune during a protest against the arrests.",

    "US, Pakistan re-engage to cope with floods, rebuild ties": "WASHINGTON: Pakistan and the United States will hold ministerial-level talks in Washington on Monday (today), indicating willingness on part of both sides to resume institutionalised engagement after a long absence.\n\nForeign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari reached Washington on Sunday on a three-day visit during which he will hold in person talks with Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\n\nHe will also have a separate meeting with State Department’s Special Rep­re­sentative for Commercial and Business Affairs Dilawar Syed, reflecting a mutual desire to deepen trade ties between the two old allies. He is also meeting key Cong­ressional leaders on the Hill.\n\nOfficially, both sides have only forwarded a generic description of the talks, saying meetings would “highlight flood relief efforts in Pakistan and commemorate 75 years of bilateral relations”.\n\nAt an earlier briefing to Dawn, State Department’s counselor Derek Chollet acknowledged that the United States wanted to maintain friendly ties with Pakistan and was even ready to compete with China to do so.\n\nBut he also said that in doing so, the Biden administration does not want Islamabad to choose between Beijing and Washington, rather it wants countries “to be able to have a choice”. The United States, he said, was not “afraid of competing with China, but we would like to have a fair competition”.\n\nThis clearly illustrates a sketch of the relationship Washington wants with Islamabad, a close ally, which can maintain its special relationship with China without allowing it to affect its ties with the United States.\n\nBut the issue that’s going to dominate the talks is the one that was not even there when these talks were planned: this year’s unprecedented floods that have brought Pakistan close to an economic meltdown.\n\nPakistan is seeking, but not getting, international assistance that matches the scale of the disaster that befell the country this summer.\n\nEditorial: Funding gaps\n\nMichael Kugelman, Director of South Asia Institute at Washington’s Wilson Centre, said in a tweet on Sunday that during a recent trip to Pakistan, “the main message I heard on the floods is that the only hope is international aid, which has been slow to come”.\n\nBut the “biggest obstacle to addressing the crisis may not be the lack of international aid, but political polarisation at home,” he wrote.\n\nMadiha Afzal, a Pakistan scholar at Brookings, another Washington think tank, also highlighted this issue in her tweet. “Pakistan’s political polarisation is so hardened now that nothing seems to be able to reduce it — not its flooding catastrophe, nor anything else,” she wrote. “Doesn’t bode well.”\n\nSome experts warn that this could also impact efforts to rebuild US-Pakistan ties as scholars and policy makers in Washington also worry about the stability of the current political setup in Islamabad.\n\nAnd as the two scholars indicated, this was already affecting Islamabad’s efforts to raise funds for the relief and rehabilitation of flood victims.\n\nIn his speeches and statements at the UN General Assembly this week, Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif not only appealed to the international community to help Pakistan but also assured them that the funds they send would be used for the victims only. Apparently, he did so to assure the donors that the aid would not be misappropriated, as some of them fear.\n\nExperts say that in their talks in Washington, Pakistan would not only seek, and probably get, more assistance but would also ask for US support to its efforts to reschedule its debt. In his engagements at the UN, the prime minister minced no words in reminding the donors that “all hell may break lose” if Pakistan does not get debt relief.\n\nMr Chollet, when asked if the United States would help Pakistan in getting its debt rescheduled, said Washington was aware of the situation but he did “not want to get ahead of an official US decision” on this issue.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 26th, 2022",
    "Climate change: Pakistan floods 'likely' made worse by warming": "\"What we saw in Pakistan is exactly what climate projections have been predicting for years. It's also in line with historical records showing that heavy rainfall has dramatically increased in the region since humans started emitting large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. And our own analysis also shows clearly that further warming will make these heavy rainfall episodes even more intense.\"",
    "Pakistan: Four killed, five injured in Balochistan attacks": "Balochistan [Pakistan], September 26 (ANI): Four people were killed and five others sustained injuries in three separate attacks in two districts of the Balochistan province of Pakistan on Sunday, local media reported.\n\nAccording to a Pakistani publication, the Dawn, officials confirmed that the attacks took place in the Nasirabad and Washuk districts of Balochistan.\n\nIn the first attack, a seven-year-old child and a man were killed after unidentified men broke into a house in the Goth Mundar area of Nasirabad’s Chatar tehsil and opened fire at them.\n\nThe assistants used automatic weapons, the official said.\n\nThe deceased and injured were shifted to the district hospital in Dera Murad Jamali town of the Nasirabad district. The dead were identified as Shanela, (7) and Samandar Ali Banger, (35), whereas the injured included Noor Jahan, Akhtar Ali, Ahmed Ali, Shabila and Farhan, reported Dawn.\n\nIn another similar incident, two people were killed in separate attacks in the Mashkel area of the Washuk district, reported Dawn.\n\nAccording to the Assistant Commissioner, Zahid Shahwani three armed men on a motorcycle opened fire at a man and ran away.\n\n“Three men were riding a motorbike when armed men opened fire and killed a person named Muhammad Bilal. A suspect was already in custody while the Levies force was searching for other attackers,” he added.\n\nThe other attack took place in the Bugg area where robbers killed truck driver Badr-i-Alam over resistance. They also took away his Iranian-made Zamyad vehicle loaded with Iranian oil. The driver, critically injured in the knife attack, later died of injuries while being moved to a hospital, reported Dawn.\n\nAccording to several reports, innocent Balochs are killed in fake encounters and their mutilated bodies are found in remote places.\n\nForceful abductions are being carried out in Balochistan since the early 2000s.\n\nAn annual report of the Human Rights Council of Balochistan, which is an organisation that documents human rights violations in the province, has said that students remain the main target of these kidnappings both in Balochistan as well as in other regions of Pakistan. The victims also include several political activists, journalists, teachers, doctors, poets, and lawyers.\n\nIn July, Pakistani security forces forcibly abducted 45 persons including 10 students. Fifteen people were released later while the whereabouts of 35 people remain unknown.\n\nJuly witnessed an increase in the cases of killings as compared to the previous months.\n\nHuman Rights Council of Balochistan documented 48 cases of killings, including five women while fourteen bodies remained unidentified.

    "Pakistan Foreign Minister: Help Needed After 'Overwhelming' Floods": "Pakistan needs financial help to deal with \"overwhelming\" floods, its foreign minister said on Sunday, adding that he hoped financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund would take the economic fallout into account.\n\nUnusually heavy monsoon rains have caused devastating floods in both the north and south of the country, affecting more than 30 million people and killing more than 1,000.\n\n\"I haven't seen destruction of this scale, I find it very difficult to put into words ... it is overwhelming,\" said Pakistan's Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari in an interview with Reuters, adding many crops that provided much of the population's livelihoods had been wiped out.\n\n\"Obviously this will have an effect on the overall economic situation,\" he said.\n\nThe South Asian nation was already in an economic crisis, facing high inflation, a depreciating currency and a current account deficit.\n\nThe IMF board will decide this week on whether to release $1.2 billion as part of the seventh and eighth tranches of Pakistan's bailout program, which it entered in 2019.\n\nBhutto-Zardari said the board was expected to approve the release given an agreement between Pakistani officials and IMF staff had already been reached and he hoped in coming months the IMF would recognize the impact of the floods.\n\n\"Going forward, I would expect not only the IMF, but the international community and international agencies to truly grasp the level of devastation,\" he said.\n\nClimate change\n\nBhutto-Zardari, the son of assassinated former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, said the economic impact was still being assessed, but that some estimates had put it at $4 billion. Given the impact on infrastructure and people's livelihoods, he said he expected the total figure would be much higher.\n\nPakistan's central bank had already flagged the record monsoon rainfall as a threat to economic output given its impact on agriculture.\n\nPakistan would this week launch an appeal asking United Nations member states to contribute to relief efforts, Bhutto-Zardari said, and the country needed to look at how it would handle the longer term impacts of climate change.\n\n\"In the next phase, when we look towards rehabilitation and reconstruction, we will have conversations not only with the IMF, but with the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank,” Bhutto-Zardari said.\n\nBhutto-Zardari said after relief efforts, the country would have to look at how to develop infrastructure that was more resistant to both floods and droughts and address the huge changes faced by the agriculture sector.\n\n\"Despite the fact that Pakistan contributes negligible amounts to the overall carbon footprint ... we are devastated by climate disasters such as these time and time again, and we have to adapt within our limited resources, however we can, to live in this new environment,\" he said.",
    "Pashtuns hold anti-Pakistan protest outside UN in Geneva": "Geneva [Switzerland], September 26 (ANI): A large number of Pashtuns participated in a protest outside the United Nations to raise the human rights violations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.\n\nThe demonstration was organised by the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM) during the ongoing 51st session of the UN Human Rights Council. The participants, including the Afghan Pashtuns, raised slogans decrying Pakistan for supporting terror groups and carrying out atrocities on the Pashtuns.\n\n“The issues of Baloch, Pashtuns and Sindhis which are arising due to Punjabi domination in Pakistan will be raised at the United Nations. The representatives of PTM are forcibly disappeared and extra-judicially killed. The Pakistan army is helping the Taliban to regain in the region,” Malik Barzai, the representative of PTM in Belgium said.\n\nFazal-ur Rehman Afridi, a Pashtun human rights activist said: “Its important to raise awareness among the people, not only in Pakistan but around the world that the Pashtuns are the victims of state-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan is using terrorists for such activities”.\n\nThe Pashtuns also organised a conference inside the UN where experts and intellectuals make deliberations on the situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The people in Pakistan’s Pashtun-dominated areas are facing persecution since Pakistan Army launched so-called war against terrorism.\n\nThey targeted the innocent Pashtuns, including women and children. A large number of youth disappeared, and the Pakistan Army brutally killed many. The residents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are demanding peace and have rejected terrorism and Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), who enjoys Islamabad’s support.

    "US ‘concerned’ over Pakistan media curbs, attacks on journalists": "US State Department spokesman says press freedom undermined after a TV channel sympathetic to Imran Khan was briefly blocked by the government.\n\nIslamabad, Pakistan – The United States has expressed concern over press freedom in Pakistan after a television channel considered to be sympathetic towards former Prime Minister Imran Khan was briefly blocked by the government.\n\n“We are concerned that media and content restrictions, as well as a lack of accountability for attacks against journalists, undermine the exercise of freedom of expression,” US State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters on Tuesday.\n\nPrice was responding to a question from a journalist working for the ARY Network, which was blocked for more than three weeks before it was allowed back on air on September 3.\n\nPrice acknowledged the pressure on the popular television network that the Pakistani government has accused of “hateful, seditious and malicious content”.\n\n“I know that your outlet, ARY, has not been immune to this constricted space. We routinely raise our concerns about press freedom to all stakeholders around the world, including to our partners and our counterparts in Pakistan,” he said.\n\nAfter it was temporarily blocked in August, ARY had to let go of some of its senior presenters while one of its senior executives was briefly arrested.\n\nLast week, Pakistani authorities indefinitely shut down Bol News, another news channel seen as supportive of Khan and his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party.\n\nThe country’s media regulatory body said the channel was ordered to close because it “did not submit application for renewal of its licence”.\n\nSami Ibraham, president and managing director of the channel, told Al Jazeera there is pressure on the management to remove a few individuals from the company, including himself.\n\n“On the face of it, it is the incumbent government exerting pressure, but we have not relented and not a single person has been removed,” he said.\n\nBol News has been controversial in the past as well. Its licence was revoked several times in the last few years following multiple complaints related to inciting violence and alleged hate speech by its anchors.\n\nKhan was removed from office through a parliamentary vote of no-confidence in April. Since then, the cricketing icon-turned-politician has been holding massive public rallies demanding new elections.\n\nOn several occasions, the broadcast of his speeches on YouTube was allegedly blocked by authorities. Several journalists and media outlets considered close to Khan have witnessed a crackdown since April.\n\nIn a tweet on Tuesday night, Khan said the government is “persecuting journalists who give our views a voice, suspending TV channels and YouTube to prevent my coverage”.\n\nPakistan has a history of media blackouts and suppression of dissenting voices, which is often blamed on the country’s powerful military which has ruled for more than half of Pakistan’s 75-year history as an independent nation.\n\nParis-based media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) this year put Pakistan at 157 among 180 countries on its World Press Freedom Index list.\n\nKhan’s own tenure as prime minister between 2018 and 2022 saw cases of suppression of press freedom and violence against journalists.\n\nIn a report last year, the RSF called Khan one of the “predators of press freedom” in a list of global leaders accused of suppressing dissenting voices.",
    "Snipers take positions in Pakistan to try to make cricket feel normal": "Seen from the roof of Karachi’s National Stadium, the city stretches as far as you can see in all directions, up into the hills one way and out into the sea the other. Around 18 million people live here. Only the soldiers stand out. They are conspicuous in their black uniforms, as dark and numerous as the kites overhead, and as watchful, too.\n\nThe Pakistan Cricket Board has spent so much on the security for this tour it will not make money from it even with all the corporate sponsorship. It is a loss-leader for the country, meant to reassure the English that this is a safe place to visit, and the world that Pakistan is a safe place to do business.\n\nBefore Tuesday’s T20 international you could pick out the three-man sniper teams stationed around the stadium, one on the roof of the Indus University, another on top of the huge billboard advertising Strawberryade, a third above an apartment block silhouetted by the setting sun. The Spidercam, which is supposed to provide aerial pictures for the TV feed, had been taken down overnight. The story went around that it was removed when the security team realised it would make it impossible for the army helicopter that follows the team to land on the outfield if needed for an emergency evacuation.\n\nOn the outfield, the England team were having their customary warm-up kickabout. It was as far as the players had been from their security detail all week. “Every time I go to the toilet, there’s somebody following me,” said Harry Brook. “I’ve never really had that before.”\n\nThe players were disconcerted by it at first and discussed the security situation in a team meeting. It was explained that the guards needed to stay within a few paces so they could intervene if anyone came up with a knife or gun. Which, like all of this, has the effect of making you at once feel more protected but somehow less safe. It magnifies your sense of threat, as if the lobby of their five-star hotel, which is filled with well-heeled businessmen drinking tea and well-to-do families attending weddings, was actually a den of potential assassins. Extraordinary lengths have been undertaken to make Karachi feel like an ordinary place to play cricket.\n\nPakistan fans welcome England with a homemade sign during the first T20 match. Photograph: Alex Davidson/Getty Images\n\nThere’s another side to the city, waiting right outside the metal gates. Moeen Ali knows. When he came here to play in the Pakistan Super League in 2020, he brought his family and they moved around freely, went to cafes, restaurants and shopping malls.\n\nThe rest of us have been able to do exactly that this week, too. Out there, Karachi is full of good things to eat and see and do. Everywhere you go people want to know how you are finding the city.\n\nThey ask whether you’re enjoying yourself and are anxious to know whether they can do any more for you. It’s a sign of the stigma they felt during those years in exile from international cricket and how wounding it must have been.\n\nOne day, international teams will be able to experience the country the way Moeen did. But for now, the PCB has no choice but to shutter them off from it. It has been seven years since Zimbabwe came to play two T20s – the first visit from a Test-playing nation since 2009 – but the last few months have been their most high-profile stretch of fixtures yet.\n\nIn March, Australia came for the first time in 24 years, England this month for the first time in 17, next January, New Zealand will come back to resume the series they abandoned in 2021 after their government received what was described as a credible threat to the team’s security.\n\nIn 2002, the New Zealand team were staying right here in this same corner of Karachi when a bomb went off outside their hotel. Their physio was injured by flying glass and the match was abandoned. Their captain, Stephen Fleming, spoke about how shocked he had been by the way the city (which had already endured a decade of sectarian violence) carried on with its business in the aftermath.\n\nSign up to The Spin Free weekly newsletter Subscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s action Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

London is a victim too these days and it’s easy to forget that the 2005 Ashes and the 2017 Champions Trophy were played in England in the immediate aftermath of terrorist attacks in the city.\n\nThe PCB has to go above and beyond what seems normal because it cannot risk anything going wrong. And the reminders of what can go wrong are all around if you want to look for them. Ahsan Raza is standing as one of the umpires in this series. He still has the bullet scars in his chest from where he was hit during the 2009 terrorist attack on the Test in Lahore and will show them to you.\n\nA raucous atmosphere welcomed the teams in the first T20, which went to the final over. Photograph: Alex Davidson/Getty Images\n\nThe country’s governing body has grand plans for the next few years. It is launching a Women’s Super League and is recruiting some high-profile investors, as well as a Pakistan Junior League, in which 66 under-19 players from around the world will take part in a T20 tournament in Lahore.\n\nSome 175 foreign players have registered to be part of the draft for that, including 10 from England, such as the two leg-spinners Archie Lenham and Rehan Ahmed. The hope here is that it will be the first of many trips to Pakistan made by that generation of players and that over the years the PCB will be able to peel back those layers of security so that by the end of their fledgling careers, their country will be a destination like any other.",

    "Afghanistan blames border clash on Pakistan’s bid to build post": "Taliban says Pakistani soldiers tried to erect a military structure on the Afghan-Pakistani border, causing Tuesday’s deadly skirmish.\n\nThe Taliban government in Afghanistan has blamed the Pakistan army’s attempt to build a security post at their border as the reason behind Tuesday’s cross-border skirmish, causing multiple deaths on both sides, including at least three Pakistani soldiers.\n\n“Pakistan forces tried to erect a military post near the line,” Taliban spokesman Bilal Karimi said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe exchange of fire between the two sides happened in Paktia province on the Afghan side and Pakistan’s Kurram region.\n\nKarimi said some Afghan authorities went to talk to the Pakistani officials allegedly building the border post, but they were fired upon.\n\n“Both sides exchanged fires, which may have resulted in the loss of lives,” he said in the statement, without revealing the details of Afghan casualties.\n\nThe statement added that the Afghan government is investigating the matter and that the leadership of both nations were in touch to ensure no repeat of such an incident takes place.\n\nThe Taliban’s response came a day after the Pakistani military claimed the “terrorists from inside Afghanistan” opened fire on Pakistani troops stationed in Kurram, resulting in “heavy casualties” for the rebel fighters.\n\n“Pakistan strongly condemns the use of Afghan soil by terrorists for activities against Pakistan and expects that Afghan government will not allow conduct of such activities in future,” the statement said.\n\nContinuing tensions\n\nThe incident came amid simmering tensions between the South Asian neighbours since the Taliban seized power in Kabul a year ago.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Taliban rejected reports claiming Pakistan’s Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM) chief Masood Azhar had sought refuge in Afghanistan.\n\nJeM aims to overthrow India’s control over Indian-administered Kashmir and was designated a terrorist organisation by the United Nations in 2001. Azhar was added to the list in 2019.\n\nPakistani media reports quoting foreign ministry sources on Tuesday said Islamabad had written to Kabul, asking to locate and arrest Azhar.\n\nWhile the Pakistani government did not respond to the reports, the Taliban issued a statement, rejecting Azhar’s presence in Afghanistan.\n\n“We reiterate that the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan does not allow any armed oppositions in its territory to operate against any other country,” the statement said.\n\n“We also call on all parties to refrain from such allegations lacking any proof and documentations. Such media allegations can adversely affect bilateral relations.”\n\nPakistan’s foreign ministry did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for a comment on the matter.",
    "Rallies Show Pakistan’s Ex-PM Khan Remains Political Force": "Since he was toppled by parliament five months ago, former Prime Minister Imran Khan has demonstrated his continued popularity with mass rallies across Pakistan, signaling to his rivals that he remains a considerable political force.\n\nOn Tuesday, he addressed some 25,000 supporters in the northwestern city of Peshawar, the capital of deeply conservative Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan.\n\nKhan said he would soon organize a mass march to the capital, as a culmination of his campaign to force the government of Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif to hold a snap election, which some analysts say Khan might win due to a groundswell of support.\n\n“I will soon give you a call for a march on Islamabad,” Khan told the cheering crowd, then asked: “Are you ready for it?”\n\n“Yes,” came the response from his supporters.\n\nSharif has rejected the demand for early elections, saying the vote should take place as scheduled in 2023.\n\nAs during previous rallies, Tuesday’s speech was not shown live by TV stations on instructions from the country’s media regulatory agency. The regulators have banned broadcasting his live speeches, purportedly because of his recent critical remarks about the military and judiciary. Viewers also had difficulty accessing the speech via YouTube and other social media.\n\nSince his ouster, Khan has claimed that the current government came into power under a plot by the U.S. which allegedly disagreed with his more independent foreign policy; Washington has denied such a claim.\n\nKhan had served as prime minister for over three-and-a-half years until he was brought down by an alliance of political parties in a parliamentary no-confidence vote in April.\n\nIn a new twist to his comeback campaign, the former cricket star-turned-Islamist politician faces terrorism charges for allegedly threatening police and a judge at a rally last month in Islamabad. At the time, Khan sharply criticized the authorities for having arrested his close aide Shahbaz Gill on charges of inciting troops to mutiny against top army generals.\n\nKhan could face several years in prison under Pakistan’s 1997 anti-terrorism law, which grants police wider powers. He is currently on a type of bail that shields him from arrest until September 12.\n\n“Look, a terrorist is standing in front of you,” Khan sarcastically told the crowd Tuesday evening.\n\nA force\n\nAnalysts say that even in the opposition, Khan remains a political force.\n\n“Yes, Imran Khan will win elections whenever the voting takes place,” predicted Rana Akram Rabbani, a newspaper columnist and former senior politician.\n\nIn Tuesday’s speech, Khan again attacked Washington, saying his removal from office was the result of a U.S.-organized plot and collusion with Sharif. Both have denied the allegation.\n\nKhan said Pakistan should not allow its soil to be used for attacks against any country.\n\nHis comments come amid reports that the U.S. drones were using Pakistan’s air space for surveillance in neighboring Afghanistan, where the Afghan Taliban seized power last year.\n\nKhan is a vocal critic of military operations.\n\nEven before coming to power, he called for the resolution of the Afghan issue through peace talks. Addressing the United States on Tuesday, he said he wants friendship with Washington, but that “we will not accept your slavery.”\n\nKhan has said in recent months that the United States wanted him gone because of his foreign policy choices in favor of Russia and China, and a visit he made on February 24 to Moscow, where he held talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin as Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine.\n\nKhan has said he was not aware that the Russian invasion of Ukraine would start during his visit.\n\nMilitary ties\n\nAfter coming to power in 2018, Khan initially enjoyed excellent ties with the military.\n\nHis troubles began when he resisted the appointment of a new spy chief by the army chief Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa.\n\nAlthough the issue was later resolved, analysts say Khan and Bajwa never repaired the relationship and that Khan still believes Bajwa was part of the alleged plot to topple him.\n\nKhan claimed Tuesday that his political opponents tried to drive a wedge between him and the army which traditionally plays an out-sized role in Pakistan politics.\n\n“I love my army,” Khan said.",

Gold has declined by Rs11,800 per tola in the last four sessions. The reports of stability in rupee-dollar parity following news of Dar’s homecoming faded gold’s shine. The rupee’s value going forward would determine gold’s immediate future trajectory.\n\nIn the international market, the price of the yellow metal fell by $2 per ounce settling at $1,640 — its lowest level in 2-1/2 years weighed down by a strong dollar and US Treasury yields amid the US Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance on interest.\n\nThe dollar index rose to a fresh high in 2002 against its rivals, boosted by a plunge in British sterling, making gold more expensive for other currency holders. Prices have fallen more than $400, or over 20%, since scaling above the critical $2,000 per ounce level in March as major central banks raised interest rates sharply to tame soaring inflation.\n\nGold rates in Pakistan are around Rs2,000 below the cost compared to the rate in the Dubai market.

    "Enforced disappearances in Pakistan raise questions over role of secret services": "It was noon on May 11, 2022 when Feroz Baloch, a student of Arid Agriculture University Rawalpindi, Pakistan took his books and headed to the university library. But, he never made it to there and went missing. His whereabouts remain a mystery to this day.\n\nHis cousin and roommate in the same university complex, Rahim Baloch, noticed he was missing by late evening, when he didn't return to the campus, as he usually would.\n\n\"First I sent him a WhatsApp message, but it was not delivered,\" Rahim told DW.\n\n\"I tried calling him and found his number switched off. I assumed that Feroz's mobile phone might have run out of power and that he would be back soon,\" Rahim recalled.\n\n\"As time passed, I grew more and more worried.

The police refused to file a complaint and told us that only blood relatives can do so,\" Rahim added.\n\nNoor Bakhsh, Feroz's father who is a government servant in the Balochistan police department, told DW he soon lodged an FIR (First Information Report) for his missing son.\n\n\"It was May 12, when Rahim informed us about Feroz going missing,\" Bakhsh recalled.\n\n\"The news was like piercing right through my heart. I had to gain a lot of strength to inform his mother and siblings about this incident. Since that day, we can't have a peaceful night's sleep. I and my family keep awake the whole night, missing and praying for the safe return of Feroz.\n\nThe peace and happiness of our family have been destroyed. We are facing eternal grief and we have forgotten to smile. My wife has fallen ill since she got to know that our son is missing.\"\n\nThe disappearance of Feroz Baloch has raised awareness of people going missing. Since 2000, when then-military ruler General Pervez Musharraf overthrew Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government to form his authoritarian regime, the issue of enforced disappearances has risen to prominence.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people from all spheres of life started to disappear. Those of Baloch and Pashtun ethnicities were the most targeted. In March 2011, the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances (COIOED) was formed to work on the issue.\n\nAccording to recent figures released by COIOED in July 2022, a total of 8,696 cases of missing persons have been reported. While 6,513 of these cases have been solved, 2,219 are still pending.\n\nPakistanis raise the issue on the International Day Against Enforced Disappearances\n\nStatistics don't reflect true picture\n\nGohar Mehsud, an Islamabad-based senior journalist reporting on human rights issues, said: \"The COIOED figures are too low compared to the actual numbers. The commission was formed in 2011 and the disappearances began in the year 2000. Moreover, it is really hard for the people from the far-off areas of Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, and ex-FATA, to access the commission and report their missing ones.\"\n\nAccording to rights movement Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM), over 5,000 Pashtuns are still missing.\n\nPTM chief Manzoor Ahmad Pashteen told DW that people are still not aware of how and who to reach out to when reporting their loved ones missing. PTM members visited different areas on their own to collect this data. Pashteen accuses Pakistani security and intelligence agencies of preventing agencies like those he represents of doing what they can to help.\n\n\"Security agencies have put heavy restrictions on me and there are certain areas I or other PTM members are not allowed to enter and we cannot gather statistics from those areas,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP) there are some 6,500 people from the minority who have been registered as missing.\n\nIn 2019, the Balochistan government and VBMP reached an agreement that enabled the NGO to gather data regarding missing persons through a verification process that allows immediate family members to register their cases by filling out a government-provided form. VBMP recently started sharing this data with the Balochistan government.\n\n\"2019 and 2020 were the years when the recoveries grew more than the reported cases — which was relieving. During this period, some 1,050 new cases were given to the Balochistan government out of which 560 people were recovered. But since 2021, the enforced disappearances have significantly increased,\" Nasrullah Baloch, chairman of VBMP, told DW.\n\n\"The recent crackdown on Baloch students began after a highly educated young woman, mother of two Shari Baloch, blew herself up outside Karachi University to target Chinese nationals in April 2022. Shari was a teacher, and a university student too, and this diverted the attention of the security agencies toward academia. Since then, some 300 students throughout the country have forcibly disappeared,\" Nasrullah added.\n\nAnother student from the Arid Agriculture University, on the condition of anonymity, shared with DW how families are living in fear.\n\n\"Our families sent us outside Balochistan to keep us away from the serious security situation in the province. It is very hard for them to afford our educational and living expenses here. They sacrifice most of their income to provide us with a safe environment for us to study and learn. Now it has got really hard for us to focus on our education due to the fear of enforced disappearances,\" he said.\n\n\"Our fellow students and the teachers openly criticize our dressing, our culture and call us 'fellows or terrorists.'\"\n\nBaloch students are particularly vulnerable\n\n'Security agencies trying to terrorize Balochs'\n\nRegarding his cousin, Rahim said: \"Feroz was a very reserved and shy person, with minimum friends and social circle. He used to spend most of his time in the university library. He was very passionate about his studies and wanted to become a teacher. He was well aware of the poor literacy rate of Balochistan and was ambitious to put his share in eliminating illiteracy from the province.\"\n\nMeanwhile, rights activist Imran Baloch told DW: \"After some incidents happened in the last few months, security agencies are trying to terrorize Balochs, especially innocent students, just to cover up their failure to combat terrorism in the country.\"\n\nThese cases \"are some of those hundreds of students forcibly disappeared by the state institutions in the last couple of months,\" Imran added.\n\nAdvocate and rights activist Iman Mazari is the one perusing Feroz's case in court. While sharing the developments on Feroz's case with DW, Mazari said that initially the case was registered with the Lahore High Court Rawalpindi Bench. On the second hearing, the judge dismissed the case stating that a commercial inquiry (by COIOED) had been called and the parallel proceedings cannot take place.\n\n\"Recently, Feroz's case is in the Islamabad High Court for the inaction of the COIOED, where a hearing is expected on September 7,\" Mazari said.\n\nSecret services not under the domain of law\n\nFormer senator and ex-chairperson of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, Afrasiab Khattak, told DW that in his term in the Senate, he formed a special committee to investigate the enforced disappearances. The committee found the country's intelligence agencies, notably the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), were involved in the enforced disappearances.\n\n\"I approached the Defense Ministry with the suggestion to form a transparent law to bring secret services agencies under the domain of law. Despite multiple reminders, the defense ministry didn't respond to my request. Secret agencies don't want to follow any legal procedure which ends their authority and impunity,\" Khattak said.\n\nZulfikar Ali Bhutto Jr: No place for me in Pakistan's non-serious political landscape\n\nEdited by: John Silk"
