    "Working in Austria: Further Facilitation of the Red-White-Red Card": "Workers from non-EU countries will in future also be able to apply for a red-white-red card from within Austria. / Picture: © Vindobona.org\n\nGood news for people without Austrian citizenship who want to work here. The Red-White-Red Card, the Austrian work permit, which is sometimes difficult to apply for, will be easier to obtain in the future.\n\nQualified workers from non-EU countries who want to work in Austria will in future also be able to apply for a Red-White-Red Card from within Austria. This was decided by the National Council on the basis of a bill proposed by the coalition parties in its first session of the new 2022/23 session.\n\nUntil now, the Red-White-Red Card was issued for 24 months at a time and was subject to strict rules. It was issued exclusively for professions in which there was an acute shortage in Austria, where particularly highly qualified workers were needed, key workers, graduates of Austrian universities or start-up founders.\n\nThe application for the card had to be made before entering Austria.\n\nThe new proposals for the work permit provide that persons already residing in Austria can also apply for the Red-White-Red Card. The prerequisite for applying in Austria is that the applicants have entered Austria legally and that their stay in the federal territory is still legal. This includes people with and without a visa equally.\n\nThis means that in future, for example, skilled workers in shortage occupations or regular seasonal migrants will also be able to apply for a longer-term residence title on the spot, as the ÖVP and the Greens explained in the debate.\n\nThe amendment was also approved by the SPÖ and NEOS, although the two opposition parties see a need for further reform of the Red-White-Red Card, for example with regard to apprentices and asylum seekers.\n\nThe facilitated access became urgently necessary due to the acute shortage of skilled workers in Austria. In some sectors, the shortage has reached unprecedented heights and the economy is crying out for workers. Many of the skilled workers needed come from abroad. The Red-White-Red Card, which is difficult to apply for and administratively complex, discouraged both companies and workers from third countries from taking jobs in Austria.\n\nIn July of this year, a first reform of the Red-White-Red Card was passed, which should facilitate access to the Austrian labour market. For example, minimum requirements were lowered, such as the required language skills or the salary. Vindobona reported.\n\nAustrian Parliament",

    "Austrian neutrality after the invasion of Ukraine": "Austrian neutrality after the invasion of Ukraine Karl-Peter Schwarz\n\nWhile the invasion of Ukraine led to a wave of support for NATO membership in several countries, Austrians still believe their country should remain neutral.\n\nA statue of Athena, goddess of wisdom and war, stands in front of the Austrian parliament in Vienna. To abandon neutrality would require a two-thirds majority in the National Council – an unlikely development under the current circumstances. © Getty Images\n\n× In a nutshell The majority of Austrians do not want their country to join NATO\n\nThey expect Austria to cooperate with other European countries on defense\n\nPolitical voices calling for an end to neutrality are still a minority\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine resulted in a dramatic change of opinion in Nordic countries on the question of neutrality. For years, polls in Finland had shown that between 22 and 25 percent of respondents supported joining NATO, even after the annexation of Crimea and the secessionist uprisings staged by the Kremlin in eastern Ukraine. At the end of February 2022, however, 50 percent of the population was in favor. By June, it was 75 percent.\n\nIn Sweden, the shift was not as drastic, but nevertheless clear. In June, 60 percent were in favor of NATO accession. There, too, the Russian aggression against Ukraine in 2014 had had little impact on public opinion. In 2017, only 32 percent of respondents wanted to abandon neutrality.\n\nEven in Switzerland, which has been officially neutral since 1815, 52 percent of respondents in a survey conducted in May and June were in favor of closer collaboration with NATO. There is a growing recognition that small countries can only defend themselves by partnering with other states – which requires, among other things, coordinating weapons systems. For the first time in two decades, the proportion of Swiss citizens supporting neutrality declined, falling to 89 percent from 96 percent in January.\n\nGrowing support\n\nMeanwhile, support for neutrality in Austria remains high and continues to rise. Ninety-one percent of those surveyed said neutrality is important to them, with 70 percent calling it “very important” and 21 percent “rather important.” In 2019, only 81 percent had said neutrality mattered to them. Asked in the most recent polls about the prospect of joining NATO, almost two-thirds of Austrians (64 percent) opposed it. Only 16 percent were in favor.\n\nCompared to the Swiss Army, the Austrian Armed Forces are in a pitiful state.\n\nThis attitude toward neutrality reflects the lack of military readiness in the population. A 2014 survey conducted in 64 countries in 2014 found that 25 percent of Western Europeans would be willing to fight for their country. The regional differences were considerable, especially those between neutral countries. In Finland, 74 percent declared themselves willing to take up arms to defend their country, in Sweden 55 percent and in Switzerland 39 percent. In Austria, the figure was only 21 percent.\n\nSurrounded by five NATO members, Austrians feel largely protected despite the war in Ukraine. The shock caused by the invasion of neighboring Czechoslovakia by Warsaw Pact troops in August 1968 has been mostly forgotten. At that time, the Iron Curtain separated Austria from neighboring countries to the north, east and south. But since the country was integrated into the European Union in 1995, and since Austrian soldiers have joined military operations in crisis areas, it has been taken for granted that Austria can rely on external help in the event of an attack. Accession to the EU alone was a clear sign of the transition to a broader interpretation of neutrality.\n\nAustrian-style neutrality\n\nIn a guest commentary for the newspaper Die Presse, top Austrian diplomat Thomas Mayr-Harting recalled that the Austrians “were always for neutrality, but not necessarily for defense on their own. Even in the years of the Cold War – and in the best days of Austrian ‘space defense’ – the (unspoken) basic assumption was always that we must be able to defend ourselves in the event of an attack from the outside until ‘others’ come to our aid.”\n\nBut if Austria relies on defense within the framework of Western states, Mr. Mayr-Harting argues, the Federal Armed Forces must be interoperable and trained according to NATO standards. The NATO Partnership for Peace (PfP), in which Austria has been participating since 1995, provides a good basis for such cooperation.\n\nEmbedded in the structures of the EU and relying on the EU assistance clause, which calls for solidarity between the member states, 55 percent of Austrians surveyed recently assessed their country’s situation as “safe” or “rather safe,” while only 20 percent consider Europe, on the whole, to be safe. Nevertheless, Austrians consider the Federal Armed Forces to be “very” or “rather important,” not least because they have proven themselves in disaster operations. In the survey, conducted shortly after the beginning of the war, 50 percent of respondents supported increasing the defense budget (which amounted to 0.8 percent of gross domestic product in 2021) and equipping the Federal Armed Forces with heavy weapons to enable it to repel attacks.\n\nThe majority of Austrians believe their country is not at risk. The 1968 invasion of neighboring then-Czechoslovakia has been mostly forgotten. © Getty Images\n\nRoots of neutrality\n\nCompared to the Swiss Army, the Austrian Armed Forces are in a pitiful state. Defense expert Franz-Stefan Gady estimates that it would take 10 to 20 years to build an operational army in Austria that could compete with that of Switzerland. Critics of neutrality accuse Austria of free riding on NATO in the field of security policy.\n\nAustrian neutrality began with the Moscow Memorandum of April 1955. To achieve the “closest conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty,” the Austrian delegation in Moscow conceded that Austria would not join any military alliances and would not allow military bases on its territory. The Austrian government issued a statement that establishes “permanent neutrality based on the Swiss model.” The Soviet Union then agreed to sign the Austrian State Treaty and consented to the withdrawal of all occupying forces.\n\nOn 26 October 1955, the Austrian National Council (Parliament) passed the Neutrality Act. But neutrality is not included in the State Treaty, and its interpretation is therefore not subject to the former occupying powers. It is not guaranteed by any international treaty.\n\nOn the other hand, the obligation to “maintain and defend perpetual neutrality” is enshrined in the constitution. It could only be repealed with a two-thirds majority in the National Council. None of the parties represented in parliament is currently calling for the abandonment of neutrality.\n\nBrussels is said to be reluctant to include Austria in the defense community.\n\nAt the turn of the millennium, things were different. At that time, the black-blue coalition government led by Wolfgang Schussel of the Christian-democratic Austrian People’s Party (OVP) initiated a debate on joining NATO. The initiative failed because the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPO) rejected the motion, and an amendment or deletion of the neutrality law required their consent. When Social Democrat Alfred Gusenbauer succeeded Mr. Schussel in 2006, the topic was off the table. Only the Freedom Party of Austria (FPO) insisted on joining NATO until the matter gradually faded away after significant intraparty changes. Under chairman Herbert Kickl, the FPO today has adopted a neutral, but essentially Russia-friendly, position toward the war in Ukraine.\n\nAfter the Russian invasion, there were isolated voices in the OVP calling for accession to NATO. However, Chancellor Karl Nehammer (OVP) stated that “Austria was neutral, Austria is neutral, Austria will also remain neutral.”\n\nForeign Minister Alexander Schallenberg (OVP) also declared that in a world “in which economic, military and intellectual conflicts have become more open, neutrality could once again be a value.”\n\nCalls for change\n\nThe SPO believes that a neutral Austria in a mediating role contributes more to peace than if it were a member of a military pact. Only the leftist liberal NEOS raises doubts whether neutrality is still the best solution for Austria.\n\nIn an “open letter to the Federal President, the Federal Government, the National Council and the people of Austria,” more than 50 Austrian security experts, diplomats, entrepreneurs, politicians and columnists called for the adoption of a new security doctrine in May. Neutrality has never been checked for its current expediency but has been “elevated to a supposedly inviolable myth,” the signatories argue. Among them are Brigadier General of the Austrian Armed Forces Walter Feichtinger and former FPO Defense Minister Friedhelm Frischenschlager, as well as far-left columnists Robert Misik and Julya Rabinowich.\n\nAustria, the letter says, has neglected increasing threats for too long. Today, the country is “unprepared, and in the most serious security policy crisis in Europe since 1945.” The signatories have different opinions on neutrality or NATO accession, but are all “convinced that the status quo of our security policy is not only untenable, but dangerous for our country.”\n\nNATO has not commented on the debate in Austria, which has not yet really begun. Brussels is said to be reluctant to include Austria in the defense community. The contribution that NATO expects from the small country can be fulfilled even without accession.\n\nIt is extremely unlikely that one or more parties represented in the Austrian parliament will table a motion to repeal the Neutrality Act in this or the next legislative period. This would not be the case even if the Russian war against Ukraine were to escalate.",

    "Austria to release additional diesel from strategic reserve": "The government plans to release 60,000 tonnes of diesel from Austria’s strategic energy reserves to shore up market supply amid continued issues at the country’s only refinery: OMV Schwechat.\n\nIn July, the Schwechat refinery, crucial to the region, suffered a serious malfunction followed by uncertainty on when it would be back in action, prompting multiple releases of strategic energy stocks. With activities slated to be restarted in early October, Vienna hopes to shore up supplies one last time.\n\n“In this way, we want to ensure that there is enough fuel available for Austria despite the delay in restarting Schwechat,” Leonore Gewessler, minister of climate protection, said.\n\nFollowing discussions with OMV, the owner of the refinery, and Austria’s fossil oil businesses, the ministry for climate protection will push for the strategic release; a spokesperson told APA on Sunday.\n\nThus far, the Austrian government has released 212,000 tonnes of diesel, 56,000 tonnes of petrol and 45,000 tonnes of semi-finished products.\n\n“We are doing this [release] carefully and deliberately because the oil reserve is there for an absolute emergency. We must not waste it carelessly,” the minister highlighted.\n\nOne last hurdle remains: a two-thirds majority is required to release strategic energy stocks. Thus, the social democrat SPÖ or the far-right FPÖ must back the government’s proposal. Yet, either will likely want to be seen “obstructing” access to diesel.\n\n(Nikolaus J.

    "Why Haas say Schumacher's Austria attitude 'wasn't great'": "Despite scoring his best ever F1 finish with sixth place in the Austrian Grand Prix, Mick Schumacher’s attitude 'wasn’t great' during the previous day's Sprint event at Spielberg. That's the view of Haas' Chief Race Engineer Ayao Komatsu, who says the German was dissatisfied with how the team had handled their strategy. During Saturday's Sprint event, Schumacher was behind teammate Kevin Magnussen and requested to be let through. But no team orders were forthcoming, with Schumacher staying behind Magnussen as he defended against Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton. With Hamilton eventually making his way past, Schumacher ended the Sprint in ninth while Magnussen took seventh, prompting the German to take issue with how events had been allowed to unfold. \"Mick was behind Kevin and that frustrated him,\" Komatsu told German outlet Motorsport-Total. \"His focus in the Sprint race wasn't the right one. We talked about that afterwards. We talked before the Sprint race about how we would do it as a team. But what he did after that wasn't great, and what he said after that wasn't great either.\"\n\nSchumacher 'focusing too much' on Magnussen Komatsu added that Schumacher had a tendency to focus too much on his teammate at the expense of concentrating on his own race, adding that the German sometimes needed a proverbial arm round the shoulder. \"Sometimes Mick focuses too much on his team-mate,\" said Komatsu. \"Then I say to him 'look, Kevin really likes to help you and he tells you things he would never have told [former Haas driver] Romain [Grosjean] before'. \"Then Mick thinks and realises the most important thing for the team is to get up in the Constructors’ Championship. \"I explain it to him: 'Mick, come on, you're doing well, focus on your own performance and not on this thing'. And then it's fine again.\"\n\n\n\n© Haas\n\nSchumacher benefitting from Magnussen experience Schumacher's debut F1 season in 2021 saw the German partner fellow rookie Nikita Mazepin, but the Russian was dropped on the eve of the 2022 season after his country's invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent sanctioning of Russian entities and individuals – including Mazepin himself and his father Dmitry. In Mazepin's stead came Magnussen, who had previously driven for Haas from 2017 to 2020 in addition to previous stints with McLaren and Renault, and Komatsu said Schumacher was benefiting from having a more experienced teammate to learn from. \"It's very good for Mick to have an established team-mate like Kevin,\" said Komatsu. \"We didn't know beforehand how good he was. Then Kevin came along and that gave us a reference. We think that with our 2021 car we would have been safe against Williams – we could have fought if we'd had Kevin back then. Mick would have benefited from that in his development.\"",

    "How Sigmund Freud fled Nazi Austria, leaving siblings who perished in the Holocaust": "On March 15, 1938, three days after German troops crossed into Austria, approximately 250,000 people greeted Adolf Hitler when he appeared on the balcony of the Hofburg, Vienna’s imperial palace, to announce the political union of Austria with Nazi Germany through annexation.\n\nThe Anschluss launched mass arrests in Vienna and triggered a wave of anti-Semitic violence too. Jews were beaten and killed, their stores looted, and dozens committed suicide. As the German takeover of Austria began, Sigmund Freud was ensconced in his longtime residence and office at Berggasse 19 in Vienna’s 9th district. “Finis Austriae [the end of Austria],” the neurologist and founder of psychoanalysis observed in his diary at the time.\n\n“As a Jew, [Freud] was automatically in danger as the undisputed public face of what most Nazi officials denounced as [his] Jewish pseudoscience,” Andrew Nagorski writes in his new book “Saving Freud,” published on August 23.\n\nNagorski explores Freud’s escape from Nazi Vienna to the safety of London, which began with a train to Paris on June 4, 1938. The journey was by no means easy, however, and took a concerted effort from what Nagorski calls “an ad hoc rescue squad.” This loyal group of Freudian followers included people such as Ernest Jones, William Bullitt, Marie Bonaparte and Freud’s daughter, Anna Freud.\n\n“These were a mix of colorful personalities of divergent backgrounds and nationalities, but they all shared a common interest: a devotion to Freud and his theories,” Nagorski writes in the book’s opening chapter. “They also wanted Freud to overcome his reluctance to leave Vienna.”\n\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms\n\nNagorski has spent more than three decades as an award-winning Newsweek foreign correspondent and editor in Germany, Russia, Poland, Italy and Hong Kong. From 2008 to April 2014, Nagorski was vice president and director of the international affairs think tank EastWest Institute.\n\nThe Scottish-born American journalist’s other books include “1941: The Year Germany Lost the War,” “The Nazi Hunters” and “Hitlerland: American Eyewitnesses to the Nazi Rise to Power.”\n\nThe Times of Israel caught up with Nagorski via Zoom from his home in St. Augustine, Florida. The conversation has been edited for clarity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Times of Israel: Sigmund Freud coined the term “psychoanalysis” in 1896. Can you speak about how the scientific and cultural movement grew in Vienna during the early 20th century?\n\nAndrew Nagorski: It began with the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society. This was a small group that gathered every Wednesday evening at Freud’s residence in Vienna’s 9th district. Freud wanted to spread those ideas way beyond Vienna and Budapest, where most of the early followers were from.\n\nAlso, this early group of psychoanalysts were mostly Jewish. Freud did not want psychoanalysis to be perceived as a Jewish science. Moreover, he was conscious enough of antisemitism to know that if that happened, it would be to the detriment of psychoanalysis. He was therefore delighted when the Swiss psychologist Carl Jung, who was a gentile, expressed a fervent interest to become a follower of [psychoanalysis]. But they later had a falling out.\n\nIn the book you explore how the Nazis stole some of Freud’s ideas, which seems rather odd given the fact that they publicly burned his books in Berlin in 1933.\n\nIndeed, the Nazis publicly denounced Freud’s work and psychoanalysis. But in 1936, Matthias Göring — the cousin of Hitler’s righthand man, Hermann Göring — launched the German Institute for Psychological Research and Psychotherapy in Berlin. This was based on the premise that the Nazis would create their own form of psychotherapy. The idea was that it would be purged from Jewish ideas and Jewish analysts. But in doing this, the Nazis were clearly building upon fundamental ideas that had been pioneered by Freud and his followers, even though they claimed it had nothing to do with Freud or the early versions of psychoanalysis.\n\nCan you talk about Freud’s relationship with Zionism?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was complicated. He was a board member of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Freud was not opposed to the notion of a Jewish state. He talked about being sympathetic to the Zionist impulse. But he also spoke about what he saw as the practical problems of a homeland for the Jews in what was then Mandatory Palestine.\n\nThis was expressed in a very famous letter which was buried for a long time in Israel.\n\nIn that letter, Freud said he did not see how Muslims and Christians would tolerate Jewish control of the Holy Land if the Zionist project were realized. He argued that it would be better to have a Jewish homeland somewhere else. But he also understood that, for historical and cultural reasons, which were fundamental to the idea of a Jewish state, this would never be acceptable to Jews. Freud therefore had contradictory impulses on this topic. He identified as a cultural Jew and was proud of his Jewish heritage. But he was an atheist with no connection to religious belief himself, even though he was fascinated by religion as a cultural subject.\n\nIn the book you discuss Freud’s sex life, although there isn’t a great deal of gossip or scandal to speak about. What does this tell us about Freud’s work and biographical story?\n\nFreud once said, “I’m all for greater sexual freedom, but I don’t make use of that sexual freedom myself.” He was a straitlaced guy. He married Martha, his wife, [at age 30] and he was a dedicated family man from this point on. Freud could talk with his patients, most of whom were very sexually active, about everything without inhibitions and judgment. But in his own life, he was very [sexually] cautious and conservative. I would even go so far as to say that he was awkward and shy around women.\n\nErnest Jones, Freud’s official biographer, is a key figure in your book. What role did Jones play in promoting Freud’s work in the Anglophile world?\n\nErnest Jones was a Welsh doctor who began reading Freud’s work in German as a young man. Jones was then introduced to Freud via Carl Jung. Jones brought Freud’s work into the English-speaking world. Previously, it was available only in German. Later, Jones became president of the International Psychoanalytical Society. Jones and Freud developed a real rapport. Jones really helped to make Freud a global figure. His three-volume biography on Freud is still the first place one should look when investigating Freud’s life.\n\nYou also explore the relationship between Anna Freud and her father. It was quite intense!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnna was the youngest of the Freuds’ six children. Freud became her analyst. He advised against this later. Then as Freud got older, Anna took care of his daily needs, in his apartment in Berggasse 19 in Vienna, and then later at Freud’s house in Hampstead, London, where he died in September 1939. Anna also played an important role in the rescue operation for the Freud family. She negotiated with the Nazis, which helped overcome the bureaucratic obstacles standing in the way of them emigrating to England.\n\nUnder what conditions did Freud eventually escape Nazi Vienna? Was it simply a question of money? Or did his social and professional connections help with the evacuation?\n\nMoney, of course, came into the equation. But it wasn’t just a question of money. When the Anschluss happened, the Nazis appointed so-called trustees for prominent Jewish families [in Austria] — particularly rich Jewish families. Freud was part of this wealthy group, although he was by no means the richest. The Nazis created what they called a flight tax. This saw them assess the individual wealth of some of Vienna’s richest Jews. In Freud’s case, they calculated that he had a net worth [in assets] of about $50,000. This included his apartment and the International Psychoanalytic Publishing House. In today’s money that amounts to about a million dollars. The Nazis then ordered Freud to pay roughly 25 percent of this sum.\n\nDid Freud pay the Nazis and where did he get the money?\n\nA wealthy woman, Marie Bonaparte, who was the wife of Prince George of Greece and Denmark, and also the great-grandniece of Napoleon. She provided most of it in cash.\n\nIn 1938 there was not a lot of countries eager to accept Jewish refugees from the Third Reich. How did Freud manage to be accepted into England?\n\nErnest Jones played an important role. He pulled every string he could in London to make sure the Freuds got entry permits into England. Jones was very resourceful and had a lot of connections in high places. But until the Freuds got on the train in Vienna, on June 4, 1938, bound for Paris, it wasn’t clear if he and his family were going to get out of the country safely. Four of Freud’s sisters who remained behind later perished in the death camps during the Holocaust.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWas Freud in close contact with his four sisters?\n\nYes. In fact, he left them a good deal of money in the hope that they could survive. Freud was very worried about his sisters left in Austria. And when he got out, he asked Marie Bonaparte, who was working to get other Jews out of Austria and Germany, whether she could try again to get his sisters out. But it was not possible.\n\nFreud lived much of his life under the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which collapsed in 1918. Did his memories of its liberal and tolerant political culture influence the misguided belief he held, through the 1930s, that Austria would not be taken over by the Nazis?\n\nIt definitely played a part. Freud always held this hope that the Austrian politicians would be able to keep the Nazis and Hitler at bay. He felt the antisemitism in Vienna, which he often complained about, would remain, albeit on a modest scale. But, of course, after the Anschluss that proved to be a major miscalculation. It’s important to remember too, that Freud had no desire to disrupt his life and to become an émigré, especially as he was coming towards the end of his life.\n\nThe Austrian novelist Stefan Zweig appears several times in this book. You seem to have a keen interest in his work.\n\nI got the idea for writing this book when I was reading Stefan Zweig’s autobiography, “The World of Yesterday.” Zweig left Vienna in 1934 and died in Petrópolis, Brazil, in February 1942.\n\nZweig felt it was getting way too dangerous for [Jews] in the Austrian capital. Freud, meanwhile, stayed behind. Zweig later reconnected with Freud in London in 1938. Reading Zweig’s biographical story got me thinking about a question that really drove me to write this book: Why were so many Jews leaving Vienna at this time, and why was Freud so determined to stay?\n\nWere Zweig and Freud close friends?\n\nNo. But Zweig and Freud had a tremendous amount of respect for one another. They got to know each other fairly well in Vienna, and again in London. Freud appreciated Zweig as a writer, and Zweig appreciated Freud as the thinker of his age. Freud, after all, came from relative obscurity in his younger days to become probably one of the most celebrated intellectuals of the [early 20th] century.\n\nFreud achieved celebrity status when he arrived in London in 1938. By that stage he was already a world-famous intellectual. Why were the British so in awe of him?\n\nIn Austria, Freud developed this fame gradually. He was a well-known figure in the cafes and streets of Vienna. But in London, he was treated as a huge celebrity and his arrival was seen as a major event which got huge coverage in the British press. A lot of Brits were very proud that he had chosen to end up there. And he was bombarded with letters and invitations by numerous universities and cultural institutions. Many other famous figures in Britain at the time came to see Freud at his home in North London, including H.G. Wells, Virginia Woolf and Salvador Dali.\n\nWhile researching this book did you consider what might have happened to the Freud family had they stayed in Vienna after 1938?\n\nYes, it’s something I have thought about. Freud probably still would have died before the Holocaust began, as his life ended in London in September 1939. But I would guess that had he in stayed in Vienna after 1938, he and his family would have been increasingly terrorized by the Nazis and that his wife, Martha, and daughter, Anna, would have been killed in the Holocaust.",

He told Kicker after the game: “We’re still struggling a bit on the wing-back positions.”\n\nRangnick had a tough job, to avoid last place in a group with France, Denmark and Croatia, so there was something inevitable about this eventual relegation.\n\nThe campaign began with a 3-0 win over Croatia in early June, so there was early reason for optimism, but Rangnick’s Austria have slumped since.\n\nIn UEFA Nations League B, Rangnick and Austria may find themselves facing more evenly matched opposition, or they could even land England.\n\nBut it does have a drawback, with Austria now falling into Pot 2 for the Euro 2024 qualifying draw.\n\nAustria will not be at the World Cup later this year, failing to qualify before Rangnick took charge.\n\nCost of dismissing Rangnick\n\nThe Sun reported last week that United’s decision to end Rangnick’s consultancy early cost the club £15 million, a staggering sum to pay in compensation.\n\nThis excessive sum highlights how badly run United have been, hiring a consultant to do a manager’s job, and then getting rid of him before he could do the job he was best at.\n\nPerhaps Erik ten Hag simply didn’t need the help, but a bizarre summer transfer window which saw United chase Marko Arnautovic and Adrien Rabiot suggested the club did need some strategic guidance. United paid a lot not to have this.\n\nFor now Rangnick is back in management rather than consultancy, it’s just not going too well, and he will need to figure out how to be a winning coach again.\n\nShow all",
    "Rast got \"punished\" for conservative strategy in Austria DTM race": "Listen to this article\n\nAfter a strong second-place result in the opening race of the weekend behind Red Bull’s Nick Cassidy, Rast was again on course to finish as the highest-placed championship contender in Sunday’s second contest as he ran fifth after his pitstop.\n\nBut the track started to dry out rapidly in the closing stages of the race, putting the wet-shod Abt Audi of Rast on the back foot. As drivers who had gambled on slick tyres started charging through the field, Rast had no pace to hold his position and slipped to 11th in less than a handful of laps.\n\nReigning champion Maximilian Gotz was later handed a 30-second time penalty for a pitstop infringement, promoting Rast up a place in the final order, but the German driver was left with only a solitary point to show for his efforts.\n\nWith championship leader Sheldon van der Linde drawing a blank on a torrid weekend for BMW, the race is seen as a lost opportunity for Rast to bridge the gap to the South African and boost his chances of a fourth DTM title with Audi.\n\nSpeaking after the race, Rast explained that he had to take the championship picture into account while choosing his strategy, and the rain tyres had appeared to be the safe bet when he stopped on lap 21 of 35.\n\n\"When you fight for the championship, you always try to keep an eye on the opponents and not take exorbitant risks. You do what the competition is doing,\" the 35-year-old told Motorsport.com’s sister title Motorsport-Total.com.\n\n“Things looked good for a long time and we were fifth. Only then was the track suddenly so dry that the cars with slicks came from behind and then really overtook me in the last corner, which knocked me out of the points [until Gotz’s penalty].\n\n“Today we played it safe and unfortunately we were punished for it in the end.”\n\nThe second race at the Red Bull Ring saw a wide range of strategies as the action began in wet conditions before the track started drying out, with a late drizzle on the final lap complicating matters even further.\n\nHRT driver Luca Stolz finished second after making an early pitstop on lap 7 for wets to run in clear air, while polesitter Maro Engel switched to slicks late on to snatch the final spot on the podium.\n\nRast, however, felt both strategies had their own risks and the best possible option for him was to extend his first stint and then take on a fresh set of wet tyres.\n\n\"If you had stopped early, there was a risk that it would really dry out and then you would have had to switch to slicks again,” he explained.\n\n“We didn't want to take that risk. That's why we drove a little longer and of course observed all the competition and what the others were doing. Then we drove on and were virtually overtaken by many who stopped early.\n\n\"We might have done two or three laps longer and then switch to slicks. But it was so difficult because there was no dry track before the pit stop window [was closed].\"\n\nAuer wouldn’t have “dared” to switch to slicks\n\nWinward Mercedes driver Lucas Auer was one of the first drivers to gamble on slick tyres after coming into the pits just two laps after Rast’s stop, having been told by his race engineer over team radio that \"we'll only score points with slicks today.”\n\nLucas Auer, Mercedes-AMG Team WINWARD Mercedes-AMG GT3 Photo by: Alexander Trienitz\n\nAlthough Auer fell as low as 21st after struggling on a track that was still wet at most places, the complexion of his race soon took a turn for the better and he climbed up to sixth at the finish.\n\nThe eight points he scored elevated him to second in the championship, one point clear of Rast and only 11 adrift of Schubert BMW’s van der Linde ahead of the title decider at Hockenheim.\n\nAuer said he wouldn’t have switched to slick tyres if he was making the call, but it soon became clear to him that the team had put him on the right strategy.\n\n\"That was the perfect decision,” the Austrian told Motorsport-Total.com. \"I wouldn't have dared to do that. But that was the only chance we had to pull something off today.\n\n\"I almost flew off at least three times on the first lap after the pit stop. But when the tyres then reached operating temperature, I knew: we did the right thing.\n\n\"Fourth place on Saturday was like a victory for us with the speed we had. Only Sunday in the rain I didn't deliver in qualifying. That was shit, I have to say. Also from me - just not enough.\n\n“That's why I'm happy with the race now.\"\n\nThe top five drivers are separated by just 16 points going into Hockenheim, with van der Linde sitting at the top on 130 points, Auer second on 119, Rast third on 118, Thomas Preining fourth with 116 and Mirko Bortolotti fifth with 114 points on board.",
    "Austria will withdraw its Soldiers from EUFOR if the UN does not extend the Mandate": "Austrian Defense Minister Klaudia Tanner said that this country will withdraw its soldiers from the EUFOR “Althea” military mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina if the UN Security Council does not extend its mandate, writes Austrian Der Standard.\n\nAs stated in Der Standard, an international conflict with Russia could have dramatic consequences for Austria and its army. They point out that there is a risk of ending Austria’s most important foreign mission, which is participation in the peacekeeping operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nDer Standard explains that it is a UN mission and that Austria has been involved since 2004 despite its officially neutral status. Also, Austria has the largest contingent of soldiers, and has commanded the mission since 2009. The current commander-in-chief is Austrian Major General Anton Wessely.\n\nThey explain that, until now, the routine extension of the mandate, which happened at the beginning of November, was called into question because of the war in Ukraine.\n\nAs Der Standard has learned, the Austrian Ministry of Defense has already planned to abandon the Althea mission in case Russia blocks the extension of the mission in the Security Council. This summer, Minister Tanner’s office did a report on options in which all scenarios were presented.\n\nOptions include desertion, and military sources have confirmed that this option is theoretically and practically possible. Finally, the decision would be made by the Austrian government, as was the case with the withdrawal of peacekeeping troops from the Golan in 2013.\n\nThe government still hopes that the Kremlin will not block the extension of the mandate, but some suspect that Putin wants to create new unrest and divisions in the EU, which could easily be achieved by destabilizing the Balkans. Austrian media report that Putin could act on the invitation of the member of the Presidency, Milorad Dodik.\n\nAnother position, they state, is that Putin will not go that far because the military operation could continue even without a UN mandate, for example if the BiH Presidency requests NATO’s help despite the opposition of Milorad Dodik.\n\nIn the case that NATO is positioned without the consent of the UN Security Council, militarily neutral Austria would have a problem. Without the UN mandate, participation in the mission would be unthinkable, and the withdrawal of soldiers would be a realistic option, according to the Austrian Ministry of Defense, Der Standard learns.",
    "Mbappe and Giroud shine as France shrug off troubles to outclass Austria": "Kylian Mbappe scored a stunning opening goal as France shook off injuries to a host of key players and a series of off-field issues to claim a welcome 2-0 win over Austria in the UEFA Nations League in Paris on Thursday.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nMbappe showcased his phenomenal pace and strength on the way before finishing emphatically to put the reigning world champions ahead in the 56th minute at the Stade de France.\n\nThe recalled Olivier Giroud doubled their lead nine minutes later as France ran out deserved winners to stave off the threat of relegation from the top tier of the Nations League, a competition they won just last year.\n\nDidier Deschamps' side still need to win their last Group A1 game away in Denmark on Sunday to be certain of avoiding relegation, while qualification for the four-team finals next June is already out of reach.\n\nFrance's failure to win any of their four games in June is the reason for that, but the priority for Les Bleus now is the World Cup, with the first game of their title defence in Qatar exactly two months away.\n\nDeschamps will hope to have recovered at least the majority of his crocked stars by the time that match against Australia comes around on November 22.\n\nThose missing from this game would make up a very strong team in their own right, with the absentees including goalkeeper and captain Hugo Lloris; centre-backs Lucas Hernandez and Presnel Kimpembe; left-back Theo Hernandez; midfield lynchpin N'Golo Kante and forward Kingsley Coman.\n\nKarim Benzema is currently out too, and then there is Paul Pogba, who faces a race against time to recover from knee surgery.\n\nPogba has also been in the headlines after filing a complaint with Italian prosecutors saying he was the target of a 13 million-euro ($13m) blackmail plot.\n\nHis brother Mathias is one of five people charged and detained in the case.\n\nGiroud closes on goals record\n\nMeanwhile this week began with Paris Saint-Germain superstar Mbappe refusing to take part in a photo shoot in a row with the French Football Federation over image rights.\n\nBut neither Mbappe nor his teammates appeared distracted as they outclassed Austria.\n\nMbappe had the ball in the net inside 90 seconds only to be denied by the offside flag, and he was a constant threat in the first half.\n\nFrance should have led at the interval but Austria had goalkeeper Patrick Pentz to thank for a sensational double save in the 35th minute.\n\nPentz tipped Aurelien Tchouameni's acrobatic overhead kick onto the bar and then got down low to save Antoine Griezmann's follow-up attempt.\n\nBefore that the hosts -- who gave debuts to Monaco centre-back Benoit Badiashile and his club colleague, midfielder Youssouf Fofana -- saw their injury worries increase when Barcelona's Jules Kounde limped out.\n\nGoalkeeper Mike Maignan also came off at half-time to be replaced by West Ham United's Alphonse Areola, and France went ahead soon after.\n\nMbappe collected a Giroud pass on the left before surging inside, bouncing off Austria's Marcel Sabitzer, and lashing a shot beyond Pentz.\n\nHe celebrated by mimicking a photographer, an apparent nod to the troublesome quarrel over image rights.\n\nGiroud then marked his return to the side by heading in Griezmann's cross to make it 2-0 with his 49th international goal.\n\nHe is now just two shy of Thierry Henry's French record of 51.\n\n(AFP)\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe",
    "Irregular migrant influx to Austria hits record high": "The government is being urged to tackle the issue of irregular migration as more than 3,000 irregular migrants and refugees entered Austria this week, topping the record reached in the first week of September.\n\nAs presidential elections are set for 9 October, and most nominees are on the far right side of the political spectrum, the campaign has brought issues like migration to the fore.\n\nAustria has seen a massive influx in the number of refugees this year as it registered 47,000 refugees, compared to the 19,000 registered for 2021. Most are from the Middle East, particularly Afghanistan, Pakistan and India.\n\n“One negative record follows the next each week. But this still does not seem to prompt the current ÖVP Minister of the Interior, Karner, to act,” explained Hannes Amesbauer, security spokesman for the far-right FPÖ, who added a warning of “100,000 illegal refugees.”\n\nThe government has also fallen prey to the Social Democratic SPÖ, currently in opposition.\n\n“Interior Minister Karner is completely overwhelmed with the asylum agendas,” the party explained. They note a failure to look for “sensible” international solutions.\n\nRefugee issues have dominated Austrian politics for years, with the most restrictive policies implemented during the two-year term of far-right FPÖ Interior Minister Herbert Kickl.\n\nThis means the left-leaning incumbent Alexander van der Bellen may be challenged, as salient refugee politics historically favour the right.\n\nIf the incumbent fails to achieve a single majority in the first round, the right uniting behind FPÖ candidate Walter Rosenkranz could challenge van der Bellen.\n\nA similar run-off in 2016 had the far-right close to victory.\n\n(Nikolaus J.

    "Time to accept that obesity is a disease – Austria is building a national system to treat it": "Obesity needs to be treated just like any other disease that threatens people’s lives. To fight obesity effectively, policy-makers, health professionals and other stakeholders need to create a health system that ensures that every person has access to high quality care for the management of overweight and obesity. Austria is currently working on a such a system that can bring obesity treatment to the next level.\n\nFighting obesity: treatment is just the beginning\n\nNina, a girl from a rural area in Austria, was diagnosed with obesity and a very heavy individual burden of comorbidities when she was 14 years old. After medication treatment and significant weight reduction, she was dismissed from hospital. But as she lived a 2.5-hour drive away from the clinic, she lost contact with her doctors 8 months after treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Nina came back, she had not only regained weight but also had type 2 diabetes.\n\n“Cases such as Nina’s show that treatment may aid, but it can never be sufficient if doctor-patient relations are not maintained, and if there is no national system that gives clear guidelines on how obesity should be treated,” said Dr Daniel Weghuber, Head of the pediatrics department at the University Clinic of Child and Adolescent Medicine of Paracelsus Medical University in Salzburg.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, there are around 240 000 children and adolescents living with overweight and obesity in Austria.\n\n\n\n\n\nA recent report from WHO/Europe showed that, in the entire WHO European Region, around 60% of adults and 1 in 3 children are living with this condition. Halting the rise in obesity is going to require comprehensive policy approaches, both in the areas of obesity prevention, such as through creating healthy food and physical activity environments, and in the areas of obesity and overweight management.\n\nObesity treatment as part of general insurance\n\nAs President of the European Childhood Obesity Group, Dr Weghuber has been leading the work on a national concept on childhood obesity treatment for Austria, which is based on the idea that obesity is a serious chronic disease that is tightly connected with other noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) including cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe concept was prepared by professionals from primary to tertiary health care and signed by all relevant stakeholders, including representatives of the social security sector, in 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nWHO has been urging Member States to take further steps in halting the so-called global obesity epidemic by 2025, as no country in the Region is on track to halt or even reduce the rise of obesity by this date.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, Austria is ready for the next step. Leading health professionals and stakeholders launched a nation-wide initiative called Austrian Obesity Alliance. The Alliance proposes a renewed obesity management programme that acknowledges obesity as a disease and demands that the social security system includes obesity management in the universal health insurance system.\n\nMany people don’t see obesity as a problem\n\nThere are several regions in Austria that have already created the infrastructure for the planned national obesity treatment programme. These structures can be scaled up to other regions of the country. But to roll out the programme, political commitment based on the understanding that obesity is a serious public health challenge is also crucial.\n\n\n\n\n\n“We need to change the perception of obesity that is prevalent today,” said Dr Michael Krebs, Specialist for Internal Medicine of the Medical University of Vienna. “There are more than 3 million adults and 240 000 children with overweight and obesity in Austria representing a wide range of demographics. Yet, more than 85% of obesity patients seeking treatment in our outpatient clinic are women. That means that most men living with obesity don’t see their condition as a disease – or don’t want to treat it for whatever reason.”\n\n\n\n\n\nIn many countries in the Region, obesity is still associated with social stigma, and it multiplies the life-threatening risks of this medical condition. Health professionals need help from decision-makers to get evidence-based messages and WHO recommendations through to a wider audience.\n\n“We need to accept that obesity is a disease”\n\n“Countries need to adopt a comprehensive approach to obesity prevention and management,” said Dr Kremlin Wickramasinghe, Acting Head of the WHO European Office for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases. “We learned a lot from listening to people living with obesity and their families, and we encourage all governments to take measures to also get inputs from these important stakeholders for all stages of the obesity policy cycle.”\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the 72nd session of the WHO Regional Committee for Europe (RC72), to be held in September 2022 in Israel, high-level stakeholders and decision-makers from all 53 Member States of the Region will discuss best practices that can stop the increase of obesity levels and tackle this urgent problem.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustria is an active participant in many of the related WHO projects including the Childhood Obesity Surveillance Initiative (COSI) and the WHO Marketing Network. These projects are helping health professionals and stakeholders to create an effective country-tailored system to fight obesity.\n\n\n\n\n\n“We need to accept that obesity is a disease. And since it’s a chronic disease, every person with obesity has to be diagnosed, and in each case a treatment needs to be defined. This is the future,” concluded Dr Weghuber.\n\n\n\n",

    "Bet-at-home warns of increased liquidity risk after Austria shutdown": "Bet-at-home has warned of an increased risk that it may not have sufficient liquidity to meet financial obligations when they are due, after a financial year heavily impacted by its exit from Austria.\n\nThe warning comes in the context of a significant winding down of the company’s activities in other regions, most notably Austria.\n\nIn October 2021, the business lost a legal battle against a consortium of players in Austria who sought compensation from unlicensed operators. Following this, Bet-at-home announced it would be exiting the market, as well as winding down the Maltese company set up to target it.\n\nIn July, Bet-at-home announced that it had “surrendered” its GB licence, and would be permanently withdrawing from the market – this occurred in the wake of the operator’s licence suspension by the Gambling Commission for suspected anti-money laundering and social responsibility failings.\n\nAs a result of these exits, Bet-at-home has categorised its liquidity risk level as “medium”, and higher than last year, as the reduction in operations create uncertainty in the company’s cash flow, assets and liabilities.\n\nBet-at-home stated that even small negative shocks may leave the business with a shortfall:\n\n“If the bet-at-home.com AG Group is unable to provide corresponding collateral in the form of bank guarantees, existing cash and cash equivalents would have to be deposited as security,” the report states.\n\n“The remaining freely available liquidity could prove to be critical even in the event of minor negative deviations from the existing planning if, in addition, a significant reduction in liquidity were to occur due to payments to Bet-at-home.com Entertainment Ltd. and to the Maltese tax authorities.\n\nIn the context of the operator’s reorientation of strategy, Bet-at-home abandoned its in-house platform, and will be using the EveryMatrix technology stack going forward, in an effort to cut costs.\n\nHowever, there was also good news for the operator. The business revealed it was “assured” in July by the State Administration Office of Saxony-Anhalt that it will be granted an online casino licence.\n\nThe business said it expects the licence to be issued in the second half of 2022, following its application which it entered following the 2021 passage of the German state treaty on gambling.",
    "Patagonia ‘goes purpose’ and Austria reveals new sleeper trains: The sustainability success stories of the week": "Published every week, this series charts how businesses and sustainability professionals are working to achieve their ‘Mission Possible’ across the campaign’s five key pillars – energy, resources, infrastructure, mobility and leadership.\n\nAcross the UK and the world, leading businesses, cities, states and regions are turning environmental ambitions into action. Here, we round up five positive sustainability stories from this week.\n\nENERGY: Investors secured for major new wind farm in Romania\n\nRomania has set a target for renewables to account for 30.7% of its total power capacity mix by 2030 and may well increase that target ahead of COP27, as it revises its national energy and climate plan. It is already aiming to install a total of 950MW of additional renewable energy capacity by 2024, against a 2019 baseline.\n\nIn a positive step towards these goals, two firms – Low Carbon and Rezolv Energy – have agreed to terms to develop a 450MW onshore wind farm to the east of Bucharest. Low Carbon is taking a 49% stake in the Vis Viva wind farm and Rezolv Energy is taking the remaining 51%.\n\nThe €1bn project will consist of up to 120 turbines and was originally proposed in 2017. It has already gained approval from Romania’s Ministry of Energy.\n\n“Rising energy costs, heightened security concerns, demand to meet climate targets, and stakeholder expectations, are causing a rethink on energy usage – and production,” said Rezolv Energy’s chief executive Jim Campion. “Today, private companies, as well as public utilities, are finding their traditional reliance on fossil fuels far less viable. The Vis Viva project will play a major role in accelerating this transition in Romania, whilst providing long-term, stably priced electricity to commercial and industrial consumers across the region.”\n\nRESOURCES: Allbirds debuts trainers made using plant-based leather\n\nIncreasing awareness of animal rights, human rights and environmental issues arising from the leather supply chain has led to a boom in demand for alternatives in recent years – no doubt also spurred by fast fashion retailers’ desire to produce cheaper footwear and accessories for customers on a budget. The issue with this is that most leather alternatives are pleather – plastic-based materials which are made using fossil fuels and are notoriously hard to recycle.\n\nShowcasing a different approach this week is B-Corp-certified shoe brand Allbirds. On Tuesday (13 September), the brand unveiled a new ‘Plant Pacer’ shoe using no pleather and no leather. The shoe’s upper is made using ‘MIRUM’, a material made using upcycled plant materials and materials from plants classed as renewable due to their abundance. MIRUM was created by NFW and this is the first time it has been commercially used on footwear. NFW claims that the material has a carbon footprint 88% lower than cow leather and 75% lower than the typical pleather.\n\nThe other shoe components are made using certified rubber, Lyocell fabric and sugarcane-based foam.\n\nAllbirds’ co-founder and co-chief executive Tim Brown said: “For way too long, fashion companies have relied on dirty synthetics and unsustainable leather, putting established ways of doing things and costs before the environment. We wanted to put an end to that, which led us to create the Plant Pacer.\n\n“Through the innovative use of natural materials, like Plant Leather and others, we’re going to continue stretching the limits of sustainable footwear.”\n\nMOBILITY: Plans revealed for Europe’s next generation of sleeper trains\n\nImage: Siemens\n\nEarlier this year, the edie team featured a new sleeper train from Stockholm to Hamburg in the weekly success stories roundup. While train trips take longer than plane trips, they’re a lower-carbon alternative and are becoming increasingly popular on climate grounds.\n\nNow, Austria’s national railway, ÖBB, has provided the first look at the interior of its new generation of sleeper trains, at an event in Vienna. The ‘NightJet’ trains will serve routes connecting Vienna, Budapest, Berlin, Milan, Rome and Zurich.\n\nThe first of the 33 new trains will be launched next summer and a full roll-out should be completed by the end of 2025. Each train can carry 254 passengers.\n\nTHE BUILT ENVIRONMENT: Industry marks World Green Building Week\n\nFor the past 14 years, the World Green Building Council (WGBC) has hosted a week-long event in Septemberaimed at accelerating the uptake of solutions for a more s ustainable built environment across the globe. More than 70 national Green Building Councils, collectively representing more than 36,000 members, took place in this year’s edition from 12 to 16 September.\n\nOne of the taglines for this year was Building To COP, with the sector aiming to ensure that policymakers preparing for November’s conference in Egypt are aware of the role that buildings and infrastructure must play in the net-zero transition and the wider achievement of sustainable development. Buildings and construction account for almost 40% of global annual emissions and one-third of global energy use.\n\nThe theme for this year was Building for Everyone, highlighting the importance of creating buildings and infrastructure which is accessible and creates thriving local economies and communities – not just projects that are low-carbon.\n\nThe WGBC’s chief executive Christina Gamboa said: “As we build on the successes of Cities, Regions and Built Environment Day at COP26 in 2021 and continue to advocate for climate action towards COP27, leaders must leverage the untapped opportunities of the built environment to decarbonise our economies and provide social economic benefits for those who need it the most.”\n\nBUSINESS LEADERSHIP: Patagonia announces new ownership structure that will enable all profits to go to sustainable causes\n\nIn a bold move which you’ll probably have seen news of in your LinkedIn feed this week, cult outdoor clothing and kit brand Patagonia has announced that none of its profits will be used to add wealth for shareholders of its family owners going forward. Instead, the profits will be re-invested in the business or given to sustainability-related projects working on issues such as nature conservation and restoration.\n\nThe US-based brand’s founder Yvon Chouinard announced on Wednesday (14 September) the creation of two new entities to hold Patagonia’s stock. A new Purpose Trust will hold all of the voting stock. A new Holdfast Collective will hold all of the voting stock, and will funnel profits into social and environmental profits.\n\nPatagonia has been donating at least 1% of its profits to such initiatives since 2002 and has encouraged thousands of other firms to do the same.

    "Posting workers to Austria": "An overview of Corporate obligations when posting your workers to Austria to perform a temporary provision of services.\n\nIn Austria, the provisions of the Directive on the Posting of Workers (Directive 96/71/EC) and of the Enforcement Directive 2014/67/EU have been implemented into national legislation by means of the Anti-Wage and Social Dumping Act (LSD-BG), published in Federal Law Gazette Part I № 44/2016. In addition, the provisions of the LSD-BG ensure compliance with Austrian wage and working conditions, prevent wage and social dumping by foreign companies.\n\n1. Formal requirements companies have to meet when posting workers to Austria\n\nUnder Section 19 of the LSD-BG, companies established in an EEA Member State must notify the Central Coordinating Agency (ZKO) of the Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) of the posting of any worker in the context of a temporary provision of services in Austria.\n\nHence, foreign employers and agencies posting their employees to carry out work in Austria have to notify the ZKO in electronic form using the web form ZKO3. The notification shall be submitted prior to the start of the working activities in Austria at the latest.\n\nIn accordance with § 23 LSD-BG, when posting workers to Austria, the posting company shall designate a contact person to liase with the authorities. In particular, the contact person is either one of the posted employees, or a professional legal representative domiciled in Austria. Furthermore, the contact person shall keep copies of:\n\nThe notification of posting (ZKO3);\n\nSocial security document A1/E101 or equivalent documents;\n\nIn the case of third country citizens, an official work permit in the country of domicile, if required;\n\nPay documents and records of hours worked.\n\nIn the event of any subsequent changes of the original notification, companies shall submit a change report without delay. Circumstances requiring the transmission of a change report include any change of the actual place or places of work, of the posting period or the cancellation of the posting.\n\n2. Exception to the obligation of notification\n\nGenerally, certain cross-border work activities do not fall under Austrian regulations governing minimum remuneration, registration and notification. For instance, the exception to the obligation of notification applies if the posted worker performs the following work in Austria:\n\nBusiness meetings;\n\nParticipating in seminars, presentations, conventions and conferences; activities as part of international programmes of advanced training and research at universities;\n\nParticipation in trade fairs and similar events, etc.\n\nSince the amendment to the Austrian Anti-Wage and Social Dumping Act (LSD-BG), other exemptions apply to postings of skilled workers within a company group for a maximum total of two months per calendar year and for the purpose of research and development, training, planning project activities, business consulting, controlling or collaborating with departments of the company group which are responsible for central management and planning for more than one country.\n\n3. Posting of third-countries workers employed by EEA companies to Austria\n\nIn case the posted employee(s) come from third countries, the ZKO automatically forwards the notification to the Public Employment Service (AMS). Pursuant to Section 18 para. 12 of the Employment of Foreigners Act (AuslBG), the AMS is competent to issue an EU Posting confirmation and to allow the posting of a non-EU worker. To do so, the AMS verifies that the third-country worker is:\n\nProperly employed in the posting country, and Employed in Austria in accordance with Austrian wage and working conditions during the posting period.\n\nIn order to allow the verification of the above requirements, the posting company must include in the notification details of the employment permit and of the residence permit which were issued in the posting country.\n\nThe regional office of the AMS shall, within two weeks, confirm to the posting company that the requisite conditions are met, and issues an EU posting confirmation or, if they are not met, ban such posting.\n\n4. Obligation to keep posting documents readily available\n\nForeign employers, posting his workers to Austria, must keep the following documents readily available at the place of work during the entire posting period or make them accessible electronically on site:\n\nA copy of the ZKO3 report and any reports regarding subsequent modifications, as well as\n\nDocuments regarding the employees’ registration for social security insurance (A1 Certificate or E 101), or equivalent documents, such as the application for the issuance of the A1 or E 101.\n\nIf an official permit is required to employ the posted workers in the country where the employer is established, this permit or a copy thereof must also be kept readily available.\n\nBesides, each company posting its staff to Austria shall keep all salary documents that are necessary to determine the wages due to the employees according to Austrian legislation readily available in German, during the entire period of the posting, meaning:\n\nRequired wage or salary documents in German;\n\nEmployment contract;\n\nPay slips and proof of wage payment or bank transfer statements;\n\nWage or salary records;\n\nRecords of hours worked and;\n\nDocuments relating to pay categorisation in order to verify the remuneration that is payable to the posted worker under Austrian law for the duration of the employment.\n\n5. Austrian working and salary conditions\n\nWhen posted to Austria to perform a temporary provision of services, workers must comply with Austrian regulations on working time and rest periods. Generally, the normal daily working time is 8 hours, while the weekly working time amounts to 40 hours, excluding overtime. In addition, the maximum of overtime allowed per week is 20 hours. Finally, the minimum rest period under Austrian law is of 11 consecutive hours after daily working time.\n\nFurthermore, employees posted to Austria shall receive at least the amount of remuneration that is due them in Austria pursuant to a statute, ordinance or collective agreement.\n\nIt is therefore particularly important, prior to posting workers, to be aware of the minimum wage levels stipulated in the applicable Austrian collective agreement.\n\n6. Further obligations: BUAK and Dienstleistungsanzeige\n\nIn the construction sector, foreign employers posting their workers to Austria need to observe a number of special regulations related to the Austrian Construction Workers’ Holiday and Severance Pay Fund (Bauarbeiter-Urlaubs- und Abfertigungskasse, BUAK).\n\nTherefore, the foreign employer needs to comply with a series of requirements, namely:\n\nReport the posting for the purpose of construction works in Austria;\n\nMeet the conditions for the employees’ annual leave entitlement by remitting to the BUAK the monthly wage supplements for the category of annual leave (‘annual leave supplements’ and ‘holiday pay fund procedure’);\n\nPay the employees at least the minimum wage in Austria as stipulated in the collective agreement;\n\nIn the event that construction workers are hired out to an Austrian user undertaking and the workers continue to be covered by social insurance in their home country, a contribution to the BUAK’s AÜG-Fonds-Service for the social and continuing training fund (SO-Beitrag), in addition to the annual leave supplement.\n\n6.1. The Dienstleistungsanzeige to carry on regulated trade in Austria\n\nAccording to Section 373a of the Gewerbeordnung 1994 (GewO 1994), if a foreign company wishes to carry on a regulated trade in Austria, they have to notify the competent authority before starting their operations. Such notification is the Dienstleistungsanzeige and must be renewed once a year if the company intends to provide services in Austria during the year in question.\n\nSection 94 of the GewO 1994 specifies which are the regulated business activities for which it is necessary to apply for a Dienstleistungsanzeige. They include, for instance, metal technology for metal and mechanical engineering.\n\nThe competent authorities for issuing the Dienstleistungsanzeige is the Federal Ministry of Labour and Economy (BMAW). To submit the application, the foreign company shall provide a series of documents, including:\n\nAttestation about the lawful establishment in the member or contracting state;\n\nAttestation regarding activities previously pursued exercise of the activity concerned;\n\nProfessional qualification of the responsible legal representative;\n\nFor certain trades, proof of absence of criminal records (e.g. security trade) or of the conclusion of liability insurance (e.g. real estate trustee).\n\n7.

    "Iran protests: Two supporters ejected from Austria friendly for protesting death of woman in police custody": "Protesters against the Iranian regime are led away by security personnel during Iran's friendly international with Uruguay in Austria. ALEX HALADA/AFP via Getty Images\n\nST POLTEN, Austria -- Two supporters protesting against the death of Mahsa Amini, the 22-year-old woman who died in police custody in Iran earlier this month after being charged for allegedly wearing a headscarf improperly, were ejected from Iran's friendly international against Uruguay by police in Austria after entering the supposedly-behind closed door fixture in St Polten.\n\nPolice approached the two men midway through the first half of the game in the NV Arena, 50 miles from Vienna, and asked them to hand over the placard which said Amini was 'murdered by the police of the Islamic Republic of Iran.'\n\nAfter failing to persuade the supporters to end their protest, police marched the men out of the stadium.\n\nThe death of Amini has sparked widespread protests in Iran which have seen women take to the streets without hijabs (headscarves) and cut their hair in a show of defiance.\n\nAs a result of the situation in Iran, the country's government insisted that the national team's friendly game against Uruguay be played behind closed doors to nullify the prospect of further protests.\n\nBut despite the game officially being listed as a 'behind closed doors' fixture, fans from both teams were allowed into the NV Arena, with the main stand populated by around 400 spectators.\n\nBefore the game, media were told that neither Iran coach Carlos Queiroz or any of the team's players would be available for interview after the fixture.",
    "Austria's OETI celebrates 55 yrs of testing, certifying, accreditation": "As an accredited testing and certification body, the 'OETI - Institut fuer Oekologie, Technik und Innovation GmbH' has been responding to prevailing requirements for 55 years and, in the process, has made a name for itself. To mark its anniversary, this centre is taking a look at its most important milestones and also provides insights into developments.\n\n\"As renowned flooring manufacturers founded the Austrian Carpet Institute on 25th of September 1967, no one could have imagined how successful the company would become. But even back then, one thing was clear to the experts: the need to establish a carpet research and testing centre in the form of an association. And its success proved them right. Today, over five decades later, OETI is a testing and certification services provider for OEKO-TEX certificates and labels, textiles, leather, due diligence along the textile and leather supply chain as well as for personal protective equipment (PPE), flooring technology, furnishings and indoor air quality,\" OETI said in a media release.\n\nAs an accredited testing and certification body, the 'OETI - Institut fuer Oekologie, Technik und Innovation GmbH' has been responding to prevailing requirements for 55 years and, in the process, has made a name for itself. To mark its anniversary, this centre is taking a look at its most important milestones and also provides insights into developments.\n\nInnovation as well as high quality standards were also important criteria behind the institute’s continuous market development and constant competitiveness right from the start, explained managing director Robert Löcker. “We work together with our customers to bring new ideas for product developments to life and award products, services, production processes and production facilities the 'Inspected Quality' label. We also test and certify indoor air quality in line with the Cleanair standard, which is based on stringent national and international guidelines.”\n\nIn 1992, OETI was a founding member of the ‘International OEKO-TEX Association for Research and Testing in the Field of Textile and Leather Ecology’ with independent certifications and product labels. Ever since, OEKO-TEX has enabled companies along the textile and leather supply chain and every consumer to make responsible decisions for safe, environmentally friendly and fairly manufactured products.\n\nAnother pioneering step occurred in 1994: OETI was one of the first Austrian institutes to be accredited under the new Accreditation Act in accordance with EN 45001, a major and important milestone for future collaborations and the domestic market.\n\nIn line with its focus on sustainability, OETI and its Swiss parent company, Testex AG, wanted to build the new OETI headquarters using low energy construction techniques and ensure its carbon-neutral operation. To achieve these goals, the highest possible thermal insulation and energy optimisation standards were applied, while the carbon-neutral power supply is generated by its in-house photovoltaics system as well as domestic renewable energy, the release added.\n\nThe new headquarters, which the company moved into in 2021, provides space for 75 employees over 2,500 square metres. The laboratory areas, the analytical/chemical laboratory and the physical/fire laboratory were also designed based on the latest methods and technologies. This makes OETI, alongside its Swiss parent company Testex, the second fully fledged laboratory site in the entire, global Testex Group.\n\nFrom 1967 through to the present, OETI has been constantly changing. An important cornerstone of this adaptability is the establishment of international subsidiaries and a consistent internationalisation strategy. This led to the foundation of subsidiaries in Egypt, the Czech Republic and Ukraine between 2007 and 2010. And further sales offices were regularly added from 2014: Turkey, Moldova, Italy, Iran, Morocco, Israel, North-Macedonia, Croatia, Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\n“We know that the market for our services will change dramatically in the coming decades due to technological and social factors. In order to successfully celebrate our 100th anniversary as well, OETI will be very flexible with those services that will continue to help both consumers and industry in the future, locally and regionally, wherever they are needed.” Specific plans include a renewed focus on internationalisation and market expansion to the Indian subcontinent, with the addition of two new sites in India and Bangladesh in 2022. “We also want to extensively expand our portfolio and comprehensive consulting service, as well as accelerate our growth through corporate acquisitions in the future,” Löcker, added.\n\nFibre2Fashion News Desk (RR)",
    "Austria's inflation remains above 9 pct in Aug.": "VIENNA, Sept. 16 (Xinhua) -- Inflation in Austria remained over the high level of 9 percent in August, Statistics Austria said on Friday.\n\nAt 9.3 percent, inflation in August was 0.1 percentage points lower than the revised July inflation rate of 9.4 percent. However, energy and food prices have continued to soar despite anti-inflation government policies, Statistics Austria said.\n\nThe slight month-on-month decline was due to fuel prices, which fell by 10.4 percent compared to July. However, although statistics Austria said the August inflation rate would have stood at 9.9 percent without the decline in fuel prices, they remain the strongest driver of annual inflation.\n\n\"The trend of rising prices remained unbroken for household energy, food and restaurants,\" said Tobias Thomas, director general of Statistics Austria.\n\nThe Austrian government has introduced several packages of measures to combat inflation, including increasing social benefits for the unemployed and other vulnerable groups. ■",
    "Austria extends funding for health and social data projects": "Government providing over €2 million for participation in Europe-wide surveys\n\nThe Austrian government has announced it is providing over €2 million to continue Austria’s participation in two large European data-based research initiatives.\n\nThe government said on 31 August that Austria will take part in the next data-collection rounds of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (Share), which will take place in 2024, and the European Social Survey (ESS), which will take place in 2023.\n\nShare is a long-term data-collection project on ageing, quality of life, health and employment of the over-50 population. The survey has been described as a telescope through which baby boomers’ transition into retirement can be observed and scientifically researched.\n\nESS is a recurring data collection in more than 30 European countries on topics such as living conditions, attitudes, trust in institutions and media use.\n\nAustria’s research minister Martin Polaschek said data projects such as Share and ESS are key for making comparisons between countries. He added that participating in Europe-wide data initiatives is an “important component in our efforts to expand the data basis for social and economic research in Austria”.",
    "Austria Backs EU Cap to End 'Madness' of Runaway Power Prices": "Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer backs a European Union-wide cap on runaway electricity prices, he said in a statement issued by his office Sunday.\n\nAustria's conservative-led government was initially skeptical at the idea of capping power prices, but it has warmed to the idea as they have continued to rise in line with soaring gas prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"We must finally stop the madness that is taking place in energy markets. And that can only happen through a European solution,\" the statement quoted Nehammer as saying, adding that he would seek to convince holdouts in the bloc.\n\n\"Something has to happen at last. This market will not regulate itself in its current form. I call on all the EU 27 (member states) to stand together to stop this price explosion immediately.\"\n\nAustria is heavily dependent on Russian gas particularly in industry and heating, obtaining about 80% of its supply from Russia before the war. Most of its electricity, however, comes from renewables and there is growing incomprehension among the Austrian public at the market system where gas and power prices are closely linked.\n\nThe market price for electricity must come back down and must be decoupled from gas to bring it closer to actual production costs, Nehammer said.\n\n\"We cannot let (Russian President Vladimir) Putin determine the European electricity price every day,\" he added.\n\nThe Czech Republic, which holds the rotating EU presidency, will propose an extraordinary meeting of the EU Energy Council as soon as possible to deal with soaring energy prices, Czech government officials said Friday as they seek to build European support for energy price caps.\n\nThe statement by Nehammer's office said he would push for a sustainable model that can be implemented quickly, without elaborating. It added that he had discussed the issue with his Czech and German counterparts.",

    "Austria urges its citizens to ‘make small changes’ to reduce energy consumption": "Austria is calling on its citizens to make small behavioural changes as it aims to reduce the nation’s electricity consumption by 11%, a new campaign presented by Climate Minister Leonore Gewessler on Monday stated.\n\nGewessler presented the country’s new energy-saving campaign dubbed “Mission 11” on Monday.\n\n“Today, we are launching Mission 11, and we hope as many as possible will join us,” said Gewessler.\n\nBy making “small changes to our behaviour,” the approximately four million households in Austria are encouraged to help save energy, she said, noting that despite there being other ways to reduce gas dependence by expanding renewable energy development and a “transformation of industry,” the need to remain cautious remains.\n\nThe new campaign includes tips like turning down the heating by two degrees, turning off devices completely, and taking a shower instead of a bath, covering the fields of electricity, heat, mobility and hot water.\n\nTo get through the winter, gas storage tanks are being filled, and “ideally” the upcoming winter “won’t be much different than other winters,” Gewessler added.\n\nWhile Labour Minister Martin Kocher said it was simply a matter of raising awareness, Energy Industry Secretary General Barbara Schmidt noted that while many of the recommendations are trivial and well-known, “these simple tips should be kept in mind.”\n\nThe campaign comes “months too late”, said the energy spokeswoman of the liberal NEOS party, currently in opposition. The government is also “working against the campaign with its falsely constructed electricity price cap because it is not encouraging the majority of households to save energy,” she added.\n\nAccording to environmental organisations Greenpeace and WWF, the energy saving campaign is a first step in the right direction. However, additional measures such as pushing through an energy efficiency law, are also needed.",
    "Austria's hydropower output hit by third due to European-wide drought": "Austria's hydropower plants have produced just a third of the energy in July compared to last year due to lower water levels from the drought sweeping across Europe.\n\nA lack of rainfall coupled with persistent heat has reduced water flows in rivers in many countries which use hydroelectric power.\n\nIn Serbia shipwrecks that have been submerged for decades are now visible on the River Danube by the Serbian town of Prahovo that is also dependent on hydroelectric power from the Djerdap 2 plant.\n\nIt is a further problem for energy supplies, with Russia having turned off the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and the threat that it will remain switched off this winter.\n\nIn Romania, the Danube is at its lowest level in 100 years and further upstream, Austria's hydropower plants are struggling to make the environmentally friendly electricity.\n\nWater levels are far lower than normal in rivers, said Florian Seidl from Austria's Verbund energy provider, which means a third of the electricity is now being produced compared to last year.\n\n\"We are here where the rocks and the stairs have fallen dry,\" said Mr Seidl showing CGTN the impact of the drought at Vienna's Freudenau hydropower plant.\n\n\"The Danube should be two meters higher than its actual level.\"\n\nBut it is not only the River Danube that is being affected as it is most of the waterways in the country.\n\nAlong with Switzerland and Scandinavian countries, Austria is among the leaders in hydropower production.",
    "‘We just love proving people wrong!’ – Austria out to upset England’s Euro champions": "‘We just love proving people wrong!’ – Austria out to upset England’s Euro champions\n\nThe two face off in qualifying for the 2023 Women's World Cup, both having had successful summers at the Women's Euros\n\nWhen England last faced today's opponents Austria, the post-match atmosphere as players passed through to speak to the media, contrasted starkly with the result.\n\nIt was the opening game of a Euros campaign that would end with the Lionesses triumphing, winning their first ever major tournament in unforgettable fashion. But it started with a far from memorable 1-0 win against Austria, the occasion massive as 68,781 turned out at Old Trafford, but the performance stuttering as the unfavoured nation harried and pressured them like few others have done.\n\nThey almost spoiled the party, something they’ll look to do again this weekend to keep their unlikely hopes of finishing top of the World Cup qualifying group alive, while strengthening their ambitions for a seeded spot in the play-offs.\n\nUnderneath the headline of the summer as England brought football ‘home’, quarter-finalists Austria were one of the stories of the Euros. But they are not just a story for this year. The signs shown in July were as promising for the future as for that tournament. They’ll be a thorn in England’s side this weekend, and for any side moving forward.\n\nThat much was felt when Lionesses Lauren Hemp and Fran Kirby reflected on the game after these two last met. The mood was relief. They had got three points which would certainly, as what followed shows, get rid of the nerves that surrounded a much-hyped evening.\n\nWhen Austria midfielder Sarah Zadrazil stopped to talk, meanwhile, she was very pleased – or, in her words, “super happy”. Her team had lost the game, but there were plenty of positives in what was a “bonus game” against the favourites.\n\nWhat followed was a tournament not too many expected from Irene Fuhrmann’s side. They finished second in a group that saw Norway crash out in spectacular fashion, head coach Martin Sjogren leaving his role shortly after a group stage exit that included an 8-0 defeat to England, and posed Germany plenty of problems in the quarter-finals – hitting the woodwork three times before losing 2-0.\n\nAfter that game, Zadrazil was upbeat again, as was fellow midfielder Laura Feiersinger. Their team had just gone toe-to-toe with the eventual finalists, one of the world’s best.\n\n“We're always the underdog and no one really has us on the list,” Zadrazil told GOAL, after saying she believed Austria had “definitely” impressed a few in England. “We just love proving people wrong.\n\n“I think we showed, again, what being a team means and what you can achieve as a team. Maybe we don't have the best individual players out there, but I think we have a strong team and that's what matters and that's what's successful.”\n\nThe Bayern Munich star might be doing herself a disservice there, as she is one of the best midfielders in Europe. Austrian players might not grab the headlines, but added to Zadrazil’s quality, striker Nicole Billa is one of just two foreign players to be named Footballer of the Year in Germany – the other being Pernille Harder – while Arsenal’s Manuela Zinsberger was the stand-out goalkeeper in the Women’s Super League last season.\n\nHowever, team spirit and togetherness are certainly star characteristics of this national team.\n\n“We always have fun shortly before the games, which is, I think, very important because somehow you get waken up, you're there and you just enjoy everything,” Feiersinger explained.\n\n“From the moment we go outside, on the pitch, everything changes. That's so fascinating for me as well because sometimes I'm in the locker room and I'm like, 'Okay, we have a game in five minutes. We have the semi-finals or the quarter-finals and, it's insane in here'. But as soon as we step on the pitch, everything changes.”\n\nAll of that is headed up by Fuhrmann, one of the most impressive coaches at the Euros. To watch an Austria team is to watch 11 players who know exactly what the game plan is, what their role is and how to execute what is being asked of them.\n\n“I think tactically we are always well prepared against the opponents and that's one part, but she also lets us have our individual bits,” Zadrazil explained, giving a glowing review of a coach who only took charge last July. “She doesn't say, 'You have to play this way or this way'. We can be creative as well.\n\n“I think the best thing is that she keeps a good team spirit and that she keeps the team together and that everyone is happy and has a good feeling. I think that's what makes us so successful.”\n\n“We have young players, great young players,” Feiersinger added. “I think they need a few more years to develop and I think Irene is the perfect coach for them.”\n\nMany of those young stars got great exposure at the Euros – such as midfielder Marie-Therese Hobinger, winger Julia Hickelsberger-Fuller and recent Arsenal signing Laura Wienroither. Lisa Kolb and Maria Plattner, the two 21-year-olds who missed the Euros due to Covid and injury respectively, are right at the front of that exciting next generation, too.\n\n“It's very important,” Feiersinger replied, asked how crucial the summer’s experience would be going forward. “I think it's also so important for everyone that everyone starts believing that we are a great team, that we are great players and that everything is possible - especially for the future.\n\n“I think this tournament also showed that that we have quality and that we can be very proud of ourselves and that we won't stop.”\n\nEngland are unlikely to have forgotten how tough this team is to face – but a high-profile fixture like Saturday’s may serve as a reminder to many that Austria is a team to keep an eye on as yet another major tournament approaches over the horizon.",

In the case of Austria, two new laws regulating the labour market were not properly transposed into domestic law, a requirement with directives.\n\nVienna failed to do so for the 2019 law on transparent and predictable working conditions, which is meant to bolster workers’ rights to information about their job.

The directive introduced paternity leave and a minimum of ten free days for fathers.\n\nAustria is far from alone in failing to meet the demands of EU law. In all, 24 EU countries have failed to notify full transposition of the latest batch of the ten new EU laws.

    "Austria takes ‘historic step’ to scrap creeping tax rises": "Coalition partners have agreed that creeping tax increases on low-wage earners will be removed from the start of 2023\n\n‘Bracket creep’, or ‘cold progression’ as it is known in German, occurs when inflation pushes taxpayers into higher income tax brackets in progressive tax systems as wages increase to stay ahead of rising prices.\n\nThe result is an increase in income taxes but no increase in disposable income if adjustments to income tax rates are not made fast enough, a problem in places like Austria, where taxation levels do not automatically follow inflationary pressures.\n\n“The abolition of the creeping tax increase is a historic step. With this, we ensure that a salary increase actually remains for all those who work hard every day to live on and is not eaten up by moving up to a higher tax bracket,” Chancellor Karl Nehammer said on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to calculations by the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO) and the Institute for Advanced Studies (IHS), the creeping tax increase is worth €1.85 billion.\n\nFrom 1 January 2023, two-thirds of the revenue will flow back to taxpayers automatically in the future via income tax and deductions. The remaining third of about €600 million benefits those on low and medium incomes, for example, through relief measures.\n\nThe government’s plans include raising the marginal amounts of the lowest two pay scales above the inflation rate. According to the think tank Agenda Austria, however, the government “could have had more courage”.\n\nSocial and family benefits are also to be adjusted in line with inflation starting next year.\n\n“Together with the short-term benefits such as inflation compensation, climate bonus and electricity price cap, this results in a comprehensive package of short-term and long-term measures,” said Social Minister Johannes Rauch.\n\n(Laura Kabelka | EURACTIV.de)",

    "2026 rail tunnel Graz - Klagenfurt promises to transform South Austria": "2026 rail tunnel Graz - Klagenfurt promises to transform South Austria\n\nThe new route will take only 45 minutes, which will reinvigorate the region and create flexibility for the mobile workforce between the two regional capitals of Styria and Carinthia\n\nAustria is constructing a massive new rail tunnel between the cities of Graz and Klagenfurt that is set to finish in 2026. According to analysis published today by the company Joanneum Research, this connection, in particular, can have a profound impact on developing the whole region as a fast-paced metropolitan area.\n\nWith the new tunnel, the trip between two of Austria’s biggest cities will only take 45 minutes as opposed to the current one and a half to two hours. This can create connections between the two cities, as well as a flexible and mobile workforce, a win-win situation, according to the research.\n\nAdditionally, the Klagenfurt - Graz line, also known as the Koralmbahn, is part of the Baltic-Adriatic rail corridor. Considering it will slice through the Alps, one of the biggest natural barriers in Europe, the Koralmbahn is one of the most significant infrastructure projects in the whole of the EU.\n\nA metropolitan area of international significance\n\nAccording to the research, the new line would create a natural agglomeration between Graz and Klagenfurt, which are also regional capitals of the Austrian Federal States of Styria and Carinthia, respectively.\n\nThe expanded urban agglomeration will be home to about 1.1 million people, with around half a million employees. Additionally, the area is home to around 130,000 people working in manufacturing.\n\nAt the same time, researchers stipulate that living space along the train line would start to become more attractive as a calm and cheap rural alternative to living in either one of the cities. Furthermore, living in one of the would-be commuter towns would grant workers much more flexibility to choose between employment in both cities or, even, both states.\n\nMoreover, officials from Joanneum Research, also claim that the new rail tunnel can strengthen the integration between federal states in Austria itself, removing barriers and borders.\n\nEric Kirschner, a spokesman for Joanneum Research was quoted in a press statement, explaining that the effects resulting from the changed accessibility are significantly positive, both in terms of economic dynamics and competitiveness, i.e. economic growth and employment, and in terms of demographic development.\n\nHowever, he continued by pointing out that the positive effects are not a given, but rather a conditional result of a pre-designed framework of measures to accelerate the synergies of the project. He said that these measures need to be designed and used proactively, both regionally and internationally.",

However, despite the increase, Ryanair expects the number of passengers to remain unaffected in the upcoming months while people are looking for cheaper transportation alternatives.\n\nGruber points out that people are expected to pay more attention to the price of tickets. In addition, the number of passengers to Vienna is expected to increase from six million this year to 6.5 million the following year.\n\nStarting in November, when an influx of 50,000 to 60,000 passengers is expected, Ryanair will start operating flights from Klagenfurt, the southern Austrian province.\n\nThe company pointed out that ticket bookings have been on the rise, reaching the anticipated levels, especially for those looking to fly on the London-Stansted route.\n\n“We offer more destinations on short and medium-haul routes than AUA from Vienna,” Gruber noted, pointing out that the market share in Vienna currently stands at 25 per cent.\n\nJust recently, Ryanair announced eight new routes in the program of its flights scheduled to and from Vienna. The new routes include Bremen (Germany), Manchester (England), Copenhagen (Denmark), Helsinki (Finland), Genoa and Venice (Italy), Tuzla (Bosnia and Herzegovina), and Sibiu (Romania).\n\nThe flag carrier revealed that it is investing €1.7 billion in the Vienna hub, with a total of 17 aircraft being stationed in Austria’s capital. The airline is expected to operate more than 600 flights per week to and from the capital and will contribute to a total of 600 newly created jobs for the season.\n\nOn the other hand, Ryanair recently reported all flights to Zaventem Airport in Brussels Airport until spring 2023 due to high fuel costs and flight tax. The Chief Executive of Ryanair, Michael O’Leary, added that the winter season would be challenging for air travelling.\n\n“This winter is going to be profoundly challenging, with higher fuel costs, so an increase in airport charges like in Zaventem is not sustainable,” he pointed out.\n\nThe decision, which will become effective in late September, will impact the operation of two planes at this airport and about 15 planes at Charleroi airport that will be removed.",
