Daniel Fernando of Bulacan province, north of Manila, said five rescuers, who were using a boat to help residents trapped in floodwaters, were hit by a collapsed wall then apparently drowned in the rampaging waters.\n\n\"They were living heroes who were helping save the lives of our countrymen amid this calamity,\" Fernando told DZMM radio network. \"This is really very sad.\"\n\nPolice said a Bulacan villager drowned after refusing to heed appeals to leave his riverside house. Authorities were separately trying to confirm another death in Burdeos town and a missing farmer in a flooded village in western Zambales province.\n\nIn Aurora province's hard-hit Dingalan town, more than 6,000 houses were damaged and a newly built evacuation center housing more 200 displaced families was battered by the fierce wind and rain but no injuries were reported, officials said.\n\nAbout 3,000 people were evacuated to safety in metropolitan Manila, which was lashed by fierce wind and rain overnight. Classes and government work were suspended Monday in the capital and outlying provinces as a precaution although the morning skies were sunny.\n\nThe entire northern provinces of Aurora and Nueva Ecija, which were hit by the typhoon, remained without power Monday and repair crews were at work to bring back electricity, Energy Secretary Raphael Lotilla told President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in a televised meeting the president called to assess damage and coordinate disaster-response.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Aaron Favila/AP Aaron Favila/AP\n\nMarcos Jr. praised officials for evacuating tens of thousands of people before the typhoon hit, preventing more deaths, but expressed concern at how Noru and another storm that devastated central and southern provinces in December rapidly intensified into super typhoons.\n\n\"Is this climate change?\" Marcos Jr., who took office in June, asked. \"We have kept watched on these storms for a long time but it wasn't like this before... This is something I have to deal with.\"\n\nMarcos Jr. later joined an aerial inspection of typhoon-hit provinces in the rice-growing region, where many villages and stretches of roads remained flooded.\n\nNoru underwent an \"explosive intensification\" over the open Pacific Ocean before it hit the Philippines, Vicente Malano, who heads the country's weather agency, told The Associated Press on Sunday.\n\nFrom sustained winds of 85 kilometers per hour (53 mph) on Saturday, Noru was a super typhoon just 24 hours later with sustained winds of 195 kilometers (121 miles per hour) and gusts of up to 240 kph (149 mph) at its peak late Sunday.\n\nBy Monday noon, Noru had sustained winds of 130 kph (81 mph) and gusts of 160 kph (99 mph) and was moving northwest in the South China Sea toward Vietnam, according to the weather agency.\n\nAbout 20 storms and typhoons batter the Philippines each year. The archipelago also lies in the \"Pacific Ring of Fire,\" a region along most of the Pacific Ocean rim where many volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur, making the Southeast Asian nation one of the world's most disaster-prone.\n\nIn 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones in the world, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million in the central Philippines — well to the south of Noru's path.",

    "What is forgotten in the U.S.-Philippines friendship": "Listen 8 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nOn the eve of the 50th anniversary of his father’s brutal declaration of martial law, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., arrived in New York for the 77th session of the United Nations General Assembly. As he and President Biden discussed strategy in the South China Sea, a contempt of court order against the younger Marcos — ruling that his family must pay $2 billion to survivors of his father’s 14 years of unilateral rule under martial law — remains unenforced. And as he delivered an invited address to the New York branch of the Asia Society, activists and victims of the elder Marcos regime’s human rights abuses are fighting the historical revisionism that led to the family’s resurgence into national politics.\n\nA friendship and shared history between the two nations has often been the official framing of this binational relationship. On Aug. 5, ahead of the State Department’s official visit to the Philippines, it described the partnership as one between “friends, partners, and allies,” on the basis of “people-to-people” ties, exemplified by the large Filipino community in the United States. But such euphemisms have effectively covered up the brutal realities of what this relationship was founded upon: the colonization of the archipelago by the United States. This erasure continues to shape silences in the relationship, impeding fights for justice and redress across the Pacific.\n\nIn 1896, after more than 330 years of colonization by Spain, native people in the archipelago took up arms against their colonial rulers in what became known as the Philippine Revolution. In 1898, taking advantage of the rapid decline of the Spanish Empire, the United States offered military assistance to revolutionaries in Cuba and the Philippines, with promises to insurgents that it, an expanding world power, would recognize native-led independence movements.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis series of interventions led to the Spanish-American War between April 21 and Aug. 13, 1898, and the decisive American military victory that followed. However, instead of recognizing the newly-declared First Philippine Republic, the United States purchased Spain’s former island colonies in the Treaty of Paris for a total of $20 million. After this betrayal of trust, the leaders of the republic declared war against the United States, their former ally.\n\nWhat followed was brutality that remains largely erased from American historical memory. During the Philippine-American War (1899-1902), an estimated 20,000 Filipino soldiers and 200,000 to 1 million civilians died before the United States declared the conflict over. Even then, from 1902 to the mid-1910s, revolutionary movements proliferated against the new occupying power. As historians have argued, the Philippine-American War may very well not have ended in 1902, but rather took on a new name: counterinsurgency.\n\nIn 1934, amid a wave of anti-Filipino racism on the U.S. West Coast, Congress passed the Tydings-McDuffie Act, which capped migration from the Philippines into the continental United States at 50 people a year, even though the country was under U.S. rule.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn exchange, the Philippines would become a commonwealth, a provisionally self-governing nation for 10 years, before being granted full independence. The following year, in the presence of American and Filipino colleagues, President Franklin D. Roosevelt ratified the 1935 Constitution of the Philippine Commonwealth, modeled after the U.S. Constitution. During World War II, the Japanese occupied the Philippines in 1942, another violent period of colonization declared by an imperial power under the guise of liberation. After evacuating in March 1942, Gen. Douglas MacArthur — who had served as the military adviser to the Commonwealth of the Philippines — invaded the island of Leyte in October 1944. By January 1945, the United States occupied Manila once again, and reclaimed their Southeast Asian military and economic outpost.\n\nThese wartime aims previewed American-Philippine foreign relations in the immediate decades after the war. After World War II, on July 4, 1946, the United States granted independence to the Philippines. But the legacies of prior American involvement in the archipelago did not disappear. Various economic treaties guaranteed that, in exchange for American financial support for postwar redevelopment, the Philippines would allow U.S. companies and citizens rights to the islands’ natural resources, as well as free use of military zones on the archipelago. In effect, despite formal independence, the Philippines remained a neocolony of the United States.\n\nU.S. colonial statecraft gave the juridical precedent for the seizure of power by the Marcoses. On Sept. 23, 1972, Ferdinand Marcos Sr. declared that the Philippines would be subject to martial law. He pointed to Article VII, Section 10 of the 1935 Constitution, which was still in effect. It granted the president — as commander in chief — discretionary powers to declare martial law as a preventive measure against “lawless violence, invasion, insurrection, or rebellion.” These provisions stem from the early American colonization of the Philippines, in which military occupation was at the heart of counterinsurgency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCiting threats to his rule across the political spectrum, Marcos suspended habeas corpus and seized control of Congress, effectively granting himself authoritarian powers in perpetuity. In tandem with martial law, he declared his rule to be a new epoch in Philippine history, which he called the New Society.\n\nThe discretionary powers afforded to Marcos under martial law did not only pertain to governance, but also applied to all aspects of Philippine society. The regime swiftly suspended the free press, imprisoned Marcos’s political opponents and subjected Filipinos to curfews and strict surveillance. Those who were deemed dissidents were subjected to torture and abuse; an estimated 70,000 people were incarcerated and about 3,257 victims “disappeared” through extrajudicial killings.\n\nBy the 1980s, the Marcos regime’s hold on the Philippines began to wane. The president’s health began to decline, and his wife, Imelda Marcos, emerged as the new figurehead. In 1983, the regime’s popularity sharply dropped after the assassination of opposition leader Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino Jr. After several failed coups and impeachments, through mass mobilization, the People Power Revolution of 1986 ousted Marcos and his family from national politics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Manila’s citizens took to streets in support of his opponent, Corazon Aquino, the Marcoses fled the Philippines with the help of their country’s former colonial master, the United States.\n\nAboard a U.S. Air Force C-130, the Marcos family and their cronies fled the Philippines to Anderson Air Force Base in Guam, then found sanctuary in Honolulu, another U.S. outpost in the Pacific. The family took much of their stolen plunder (including jewelry, cash and rare artworks) with them, and their wealth is now estimated to be over $10 billion. Despite litigation, a federal commission to retrieve stolen wealth and a tax bill of $3.9 billion, most of the money has not been recovered.\n\nOver the years, the United States and the Philippines maintained their mutually beneficial relationship as “partners.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Nov. 20, 2001, two months after the fall of the twin towers, President George W. Bush met with then-Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to fortify U.S. military interests in the Philippines. Citing a strong “people-to-people” relationship between Filipino Americans’ love for the United States and the Philippine people’s shared commitment to this trans-Pacific partnership, Arroyo declared: “Long live the Philippines, and long live the friendship between the United States and the Philippines.”\n\nFormer strongman president Rodrigo Duterte, who was publicly anti-American and expressed his disdain for President Barack Obama, found much in common with his admirer, President Donald Trump. In 2020, Duterte voiced his support for his American counterpart, declaring him to be a “good president [who] deserves to be reelected.”\n\nAnd despite the election fraud and intimidation that facilitated Marcos Jr.’s ascension to the presidency — and wide protests calling out the lack of integrity in the electoral process — on May 11 Biden congratulated the new administration on the victory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut we must remember that the basis of the U.S.-Philippine “special relationship” is the erasure of colonial history. That on the 50th anniversary of martial law, the United Nations, the Biden administration and the Asia Society have welcomed an ill-begotten president with open arms, signaling the strength of this historical amnesia — and the troubling future of Philippine politics and civic life.\n\nThe ongoing fight for justice across the Pacific — for the repressed legacies of the American campaign of extermination in the Philippines in the early 20th century, to the survivors of martial law under Ferdinand Marcos Sr., to the victims of extrajudicial killings under Duterte’s so-called “War on Drugs” — takes place on the battleground of historical memory. For the sake of redress and social justice, we must remember.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

    "Personal position and geopolitical posture in the Philippines": "Author: Editorial Board, ANU\n\nAt times during the presidency of Rodrigo Duterte, it seemed that the Philippines’ foreign policy was to not have much of a policy at all.\n\nAfter Duterte’s election in 2016, Manila’s approach towards its most important international relationships was pulled in different directions by personalities, politics, and the tensions between the interests at stake in its relationships with China and the United States. A big variable was the president himself, whose madcap governing style extended to how he handled the management of these two critical partnerships.\n\nThe Philippines wasn’t by any means unique in this regard. What appear to be Southeast Asian states’ finely calculated strategies of hedging and balancing amid great-power competition are, when scrutinised closely on the ground, often a process of trial and error in which policy fights are shaped by domestic economic, and even personal, interests and short political time horizons.\n\nThe Philippines was distinctive in how transparently all this played out, and how important the whims of a personalist leader were in setting the tone for alliance management.\n\nAfter the landslide election of Ferdinand ‘Bongbong’ Marcos Jr in this year’s presidential election, the Philippines is embarking on a reset of foreign policy under a less freewheeling — though no less politically dominant — president. This doesn’t mean that the Marcos approach to foreign affairs is predictable: he largely avoided talking seriously about policy during the election, appealing instead to nostalgia for the airbrushed version of his father’s dictatorship presented during his campaign. Onlookers were left to project their highest hopes and worst fears onto where he might end up.\n\nThese onlookers included policymakers in Washington, where Marcos’ election ‘has been met with cautious optimism…regarding the future of the US–Philippines alliance’, Luke Lischin writes in our lead article this week.\n\nMarcos has talked the talk about bringing the Philippines back into alignment with the United States, signing up to the Biden Administration’s Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) and paying rhetorical tribute to the US ‘special relationship’. Visiting New York for the United Nations General Assembly this week, he touted the Philippines’ potential as an investment destination for American capital and broke a seven-year drought of meetings with US presidents by sitting down with President Biden on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.\n\nBut as Lischin cautions ‘the pro-US rhetoric espoused by the Marcos administration is not a reliable indicator of the President’s commitment to the alliance’. The economic and strategic realities that pulled the Philippines closer to China are still there. And just like its predecessors, ‘the Marcos administration appears willing to sidestep issues of national sovereignty’ — specifically on the question of the South China Sea — ‘in order to strengthen the Philippines’ economic relations with China’\n\nHe concludes that ‘[a]s long as the Marcos administration continues to hedge, it is unlikely that the United States will be able to convince the Philippines to advance geopolitically sensitive projects that are critical to the alliance’.\n\nThe importance that economics has had in drawing China and the Philippines closer — in spite of the dispute over overlapping claims in the South China Sea — only highlights how relatively empty-handed Washington is when it comes to using trade and development to bind Southeast Asian partners closer to it. Washington might counter that the Philippines and similar Asian developing countries are courting trouble by boosting economic ties with China, whose government has proven that it has no compunction about making trade, aid and investment part of its sticks-and-carrots diplomacy.\n\nBut Southeast Asian governments understand that perfectly well, and most have decided that it’s a trade-off they are willing to make. As Manila seeks to re-engage with China on a multibillion-dollar infrastructure financing and construction package, it continues to deprioritise pursuing its legal claims to parts of the South China Sea. Marcos himself says he doesn’t want the dispute to be ‘the defining element of our relationship [with China]’.\n\nBy expanding economic ties with the Philippines and other Southeast Asian countries Washington could help make the trade-offs involved in deepening economic ties to China less acute by giving the region options for investment, aid and export markets. But that means more substantial forms of economic engagement than IPEF heralds, and will have to wait for the political winds to change in the United States.\n\nStill, it’s a more palatable option than waiting for the next most likely thing to get the Philippines to lean back into the US relationship: namely, a crisis provoked by Chinese envelope-pushing in the South China Sea, such as beginning land reclamation on Scarborough Shoal, the disputed but as-yet undeveloped islets lying within the Philippines’ Exclusive Economic Zone.\n\nUltimately, some of the key decisions impacting the Philippines’ relationship with its longstanding treaty ally won’t be made in Manila or Washington, but in Beijing as well.\n\nThe EAF Editorial Board is located in the Crawford School of Public Policy, College of Asia and the Pacific, The Australian National University.",

    "The Philippines And Vietnam: Strategic Partners Or Rivals In The West Philippine Sea? – Analysis": "By Rommel C. Banlaoi\n\nThis year marks the 7th year of the Philippines-Vietnam strategic partnership established through the Joint Statement signed on 17 November 2015. The two Southeast Asian countries pursued the said partnership amidst intensified security tensions in the West Philippine Sea (WPS) arising primarily from China’s massive reclamation activities in the area preceded by the filing in 2013 of the international arbitration case of the Philippines against China in the aftermath of the 2012 Scarborough Shoal standoff.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Joint Statement urges both parties to pursue cooperation in various fields for mutual benefits and to handle their differences on the South China Sea (SCS) in order to avoid armed conflicts.\n\nVietnam, however, continues to conduct infrastructure developments and facilities upgrades in its occupied features in the WPS within the Kalayaan Island Group (KIG) of the Spratly Islands.\n\nSCS, WPS, KIG, The Spratly Islands: What’s in a Name?\n\nFor better clarity, there is a need to understand first the terms SCS, the Spratly Islands, the WPS, and the KIG.\n\nIt is wrong to use WPS to describe the whole of the SCS. The WPS only represents around 30% of all the waters of the SCS. It is also wrong to use the waters of the KIG to describe the whole of WPS. Waters around the KIG just represent a portion of the three bodies of waters comprising the WPS. It is also not accurate to use the KIG to describe the Spratly Islands. The KIG only represents half of the geographic features of the Spratly Islands.\n\nTo further explain, the SCS is a body of waters composed of at least 250 geographic features (in the form of islets, reefs, cays, shoals, and rocks) scattered around five major locations: the Spratly Islands, the Paracel Islands, the Pratas Islands, the Macclesfield Bank, and the Scarborough Shoal. Many regard the Natuna Islands of Indonesia as strictly not part of the SCS. But the Natuna Islands are included in maritime and territorial disputes because China and Vietnam claim part of the adjacent waters in the SCS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most controversial among these locations are the Spratly Islands composed of more than 100 geographic features being claimed in whole and in parts by China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan. It is in the Spratly Islands where the KIG is located. Only 54 out of more than 100 geographic features of the Spratly Islands belong to the KIG.\n\nWaters around the KIG, the Scarborough Shoal and the Luzon Straits comprise the WPS. Not all waters of the WPS belong to the SCS. Only waters around the KIG and the Scarborough Shoal are considered part of the SCS. The Luzon Strait, which is part of the WPS, is not strictly part of the SCS. But the Luzon Strait geographically connects the Philippine Sea to SCS that is considered part of the West Pacific Ocean.\n\nVietnam’s Activities in the WPS\n\nThe Philippine Department of National Defense disclosed in May 2022 that Chinese and Vietnamese fishermen, along with their coast guards, routinely conducted activities in the WPS, particularly around the Spratly Islands where the KIG is situated. However, they “could not be driven out by the Philippine government out of fear of war.” (1) The Philippine defense establishment even lamented, “The Chinese, who have built islands in the West Philippine Sea, are still there, along with the Vietnamese. Three of us are claiming other parts of the WPS.” (2)\n\nLike China, therefore, Vietnam is also a serious security concern for the Philippines in the WPS.\n\nThe Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative (AMTI) based in Washington DC already warned that since 2017, Vietnam was quietly upgrading its facilities in the WPS. The AMTI revealed, “Vietnam continues to quietly upgrade its facilities in the Spratly Islands, though apparently without facing the same reaction from China’s maritime militia forces as the Philippines recently has. Vietnam occupies 49 outposts spread across 27 features in the vicinity of the Spratly Islands. (3) The South China Sea Probing Initiative (SCSPI) based in Beijing also discovered that since 2021, Vietnam maintained their “illegal presence” and “illegal fishing activities” around and even beyond its occupied areas in the SCS despite the COVID-19 pandemic. (4)\n\nThe Philippines’ National Task Force (NTF) on the WPS also admits that Vietnam continues to occupy and control 21 geographic features inside the KIG. China and Malaysia occupy 7 and 5 features, respectively. Taiwan occupies only one feature while the Philippines occupies only 9 out of the 54 features of its territories in the KIG. Brunei does not occupy feature in the KIG, but it claims two features of the Spratly Islands.\n\nIn terms of occupied features, Vietnam is therefore the Philippines’ most aggressive rival having occupied almost half of Philippine territories in the KIG. Presidential Decree 1596 declares the 54 features within the KIG as subject to the sovereignty of the Philippines and part of the continental margin of the Philippine archipelago. The Philippine government also declares the KIG as a municipality within the province of Palawan.\n\nAs long as Hanoi illegally occupies 21 out of 54 features of the KIG, Vietnam remains as rival of the Philippines in the WPS. It is problematic for Vietnam to become a real strategic partner of the Philippines under this situation, unless a mutually accepted friendly arrangement is successfully made through peaceful negotiations.\n\nThe Philippines Negotiating with Vietnam?\n\nPursuing negotiations with Vietnam, however, will be an enormous challenge for the Philippines because Hanoi claims the entirety of the Spratly Islands named Truong Sa in Vietnamese. Vietnam declares its undisputable sovereignty of the Spratly Islands including the KIG based on its legal and historical evidences. To defend its sovereignty in the Spratly Islands, Vietnam has upgraded its naval capabilities by acquiring to date six attack submarines, four guided missile frigates, seven anti-submarine corvettes, at least 21 fast attack crafts, 17 amphibious warfare ships, 12 patrol vessels, and five torpedo boats, among others.\n\nHence, the Philippines will find it difficult to negotiate with Vietnam, which at present has a greater military leverage. Furthermore, Vietnam has overtaken the Philippines economically in 2021 by modernizing its industries, strengthening its agricultural sector and by enticing foreign capital to invest in infrastructures, transportations, telecommunications, and energy sectors. The Philippine government has to face these inconvenient realities if it decides to negotiate with Vietnam on the KIG issues.\n\nAre Territories Negotiable?\n\nSadly, it is very unlikely to resolve territorial disputes in the SCS in the immediate or near future because of sovereignty issues that parties find hard to negotiate. The Philippine government even underscores not to surrender even a square inch of Philippine territories in the WPS. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) does not also provide provisions on settling sovereignty disputes. UNCLOS only provides provisions on resolving maritime jurisdictional conflicts.\n\nThus, the Philippines can only negotiate with Vietnam on maritime jurisdictional conflicts in the KIG in accordance with UNCLOS. But on the issue of geographic features occupied by Vietnam in the KIG, the two countries need to find a mutually acceptable arrangement to resolve their current conflicts.\n\nLessons from Vietnam-Indonesia Negotiations\n\nVietnam’s ongoing negotiations with Indonesia can provide the Philippines some lessons. In 2003, Vietnam and Indonesia signed an agreement on their continental shelf boundaries. But they still have overlapping claims of Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in the waters of Northern Natuna where both parties have occasional clashes over fishery and maritime patrol activities. Since 2010, Vietnam and Indonesia have conducted at least 12 rounds of negotiations on EEZ delimitation. On the basis of these talks, so far, Indonesia reportedly has given Vietnam some concessions by offering 60% of Jakarta’s waters to Hanoi in Northern Natuna.\n\nWhy is Indonesia yielding generously to Vietnam?\n\nThat begs the question that the Philippine government needs to find out. But by paying closer attention to Vietnam-Indonesia negotiations on EEZ delimitations, the Philippines can have a clue on how to deal with Vietnam in the KIG, particularly on the Pugad Island or the South West Cay now fully occupied by Vietnam.\n\nThe Pugad Island Experience\n\nAs part of the KIG, Philippine military used to occupy Pugad Island in 1968 along with a nearby feature called Parola Island or Northwest Cay. But in 1975, Vietnam forcibly occupied Pugad Island by preventing Philippine military troops to maintain their presence there. This woeful incident left an indelible ink of ill feelings between the Philippines and Vietnam that both countries need to overcome. Some Filipino military officials even describe Vietnam as the first “island grabber” of Philippine territories in the KIG. Pugad Island is currently one of the most developed features in the KIG now fully occupied and controlled by Vietnam.\n\nUnder this situation, can the Philippines and Vietnam really be strategic partners or will remain strategic rivals in the WPS?\n\nPartners or Rivals?\n\nThe Philippines and Vietnam can become strategic partners if they can agree to settle their territorial conflicts and maritime jurisdictional disputes through peaceful means. Pending agreement by both parties, UNCLOS encourages them to exert their best efforts to enter into “provisional arrangements of practical nature” like marine environmental research, marine environmental protection, fishery management cooperation, maritime law enforcement coordination, and other functional areas already identified in the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the SCS entered into by China and members of the Association for Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The ongoing ASEAN-China negotiations on the Code of Conduct in the SCS can also facilitate cooperation and partnership arrangements among parties.\n\nHowever, UNCLOS, the DOC and the COC only cover maritime jurisdictional issues. They cannot cover territorial conflicts and sovereignty disputes.\n\nIt is therefore imperative for the Philippines and Vietnam to find a mutually acceptable way to settle their territorial conflicts affecting their respective sovereignty positions in order to overcome their existing rivalry in WPS. They also need to sustain their efforts to pursue functional cooperation in the WPS to really promote strategic partnership in their overall bilateral ties.\n\nDr. Rommel C.

I’m desperately interested in making sure we do.\n\n\n\nIn addition, I expect we’ll discuss the South China Sea and disputes in a critical global through- — throughway. I’ve spent a lot of time with — with not only the President of China but others about the international waters and how they have to be respected. And we should talk about that a little bit, I hope.\n\n\n\nAnd we’re also — thank you for your position on the war against Ukraine and — by Russia — and how it’s impacting energy prices and — and food prices. And we — we’re working very hard to be able to do something about that.\n\n\n\nAnd — and so, we want to talk about human rights, talk about a whole range of things. But I’m mainly interested to know what’s on your mind and how we can continue to strengthen this relationship.\n\n\n\nAnd again, congratulations.\n\n\n\nPRESIDENT MARCOS: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you. We’re very happy for the opportunity to meet with you despite the schedules that we both have to deal with.\n\n\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: You came a little further than I did.\n\n\n\nPRESIDENT MARCOS: (Laughs.) Well, the — the relationship — the 100-plus-year-old relationship between the Philippines and the U.S. continues to evolve as we face the challenges of this new century and the events that we have been watching over the past few months, really. So, we have very much to discuss in terms of redefining, I suppose, in many ways.\n\n\n\nBut the role of the United States in maintaining the peace in our region is something that is much appreciated by all the countries in the regions and the Philippines especially.\n\n\n\nWe feel that we are especially fortunate because we have very strong foundation of a very long relationship and the stren- — strong relationships on various facets not only political, not only diplomatic, but also economic. And, of course, there is the very large Filipino population that have chosen to live and make their lives here in the United States and have been very successful.\n\n\n\nAgain, we would like to thank the United States for the massive help that we received during the pandemic. We had the provision of up to 35 — almost 36 million doses of vaccines very early on, ahead of some of the other countries. And for that we are very, very grateful.\n\n\n\nWe continue to look to the United States for that continuing partnership and the maintenance of peace in our region.\n\n\n\nIn terms of the geopolitical issues that we face in this day and age, the primary consideration of the Philippines and the guiding principle of the Philippine foreign policy is to encourage peace.\n\n\n\nAnd I hope that we will be able to discuss further the roles that our two countries will play together and individually as we continue down that road, maintaining peace despite all of the complexities that have arisen in the past few months, I suppose.\n\n\n\nSo, thank you again, Mr. President, for making time to see us. We are your partners. We are your allies. We are your friends. And in like fashion, we have always considered the United States our partner, our ally, and our friend.\n\n\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: Thank you. It’s mutual.\n\n\n\n(Cross-talk by reporters.)\n\n\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: I wouldn’t bother answering.\n\n\n\n11:27 A.M. EDT",

    "Philippines invites US firms to Philippines": "Philippines invites US firms to Philippines\n\nMANILA, Philippines — The Philippines is encouraging global companies based in the US to be partners of the government in boosting the country’s economic growth, according to the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI).\n\nIn a statement, the DTI said President Marcos recently expressed gratitude to the US-based global companies that have made the Philippines their home for a long time.\n\nAmong these companies are Texas Instruments, MOOG, FedEx, Concentrix, JP Morgan Global Service Center, and IBM.\n\n“The identified areas of partnership include improving the business climate, building the necessary physical infrastructure, and upskilling the workforce,”the DTI said.\n\nFor their part, the US-based firms cited the Philippines’ young, trainable human resources as a primary value proposition for the country in attracting foreign investments.\n\nMarcos also underscored the recent strategic policy reforms and economic liberalization laws that will make it easier for foreign investors to do business in the country.\n\nA series of business meetings was organized by its Trade and Investment Centers in New York and Washington, DC, and the Board of Investments.\n\nAlso present during the meeting were Trade Secretary Alfredo Pascual and the country’s economic managers.\n\n“Highlighting the strong and enduring ties between the Philippines and the US, the President emphasized his administration’s strategy to partner with the private sector for the country’s industrialization and economic transformation,” the DTI said.\n\nThe US-led Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), in which the Philippines is participating, was also cited during the meeting as another platform by which US and Philippine business relations may be strengthened.\n\nMoreover, Marcos encouraged the US companies to look at the Philippines equally as a valuable contributor to their global business growth and as a partner in rebuilding the economies of both the Philippines and the US.\n\nDuring the Philippine Economic Briefing in New York, Pascual invited more US businesses to invest in the country, highlighting opportunities in the four clusters of its industrialization strategy.\n\nAmong these sectors are the industrial, manufacturing and transport; technology, media and telecommunications; health and life sciences and the modern basic needs and resilient economy cluster.\n\n“Investors, particularly foreign investors, are key to accelerating economic development,”Pascual said at the Philippine Economic Briefing in New York.\n\n“I, therefore, invite the US Business community to invest in our country. Let’s Make It Happen in the Philippines,”he said.\n\nPascual acknowledged the influential role of the US in boosting business confidence in the Philippines.\n\n“The economies of our two countries have strong and synergetic trade and investment relations. The US is our top export market and our fifth import supplier. Our trade in goods consists of high-technology commodities such as semiconductors, integrated circuits, and wiring harnesses, and others,”Pascual said.\n\nHe said investments coming from the US for the first semester of the year have been more diversified compared to the previous year, explaining that approved US investments come from various sectors such as information and communication, and manufacturing industries.",

    "Philippines, world leaders urged to ramp up climate action after 'Karding' onslaught": "Philippines, world leaders urged to ramp up climate action after 'Karding' onslaught\n\nA resident carries belongings while evacuating from his submerged home in the aftermath of Super Typhoon Noru in San Ildefonso, Bulacan province on September 26, 2022.\n\nMANILA, Philippines — The onslaught of Super Typhoon Karding (Noru) is a reminder that the Philippine government and the world leaders need to act fast to fight climate change and mitigate its impacts, groups said Monday.\n\nKarding, the strongest tropical cyclone to hit the country this year, ravaged the agricultural region of Central Luzon as it toppled trees and power lines and flooded low-lying communities.\n\nRelated Stories PAGASA modernization brings hope for better weather forecasting\n\nThe Philippines, one of the most vulnerable countries to the impacts of climate change, is affected by an average of 20 cyclones a year. Scientists warn that storms are becoming more intense as the planet continues to heat up because of human-induced climate change.\n\n“Super Typhoon Karding is another grim reminder that the climate crisis is here and now, and that national and world leaders need to step up in terms of proactive action to mitigate and prepare for its impacts,” said Jon Bonifacio, national coordinator of Kalikasan People’s Network for the Environment.\n\nHe also stressed the need to rehabilitate and conserve natural barriers such as the Sierra Madre mountain range. Sierra Madre, the longest mountain range in the Philippines and the site of nearly half of the country’s surviving old-growth forest, historically serves as a buffer against storms that develop in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nSierra Madre remains under heavy threat of illegal logging, mining activities, and development projects.\n\n“In this light, destructive projects such as the Kaliwa-Kanan Dam and attacks on conservation areas like Masungi Georeserve are direct threats to the lives of millions of Filipinos, and the Marcos administration, if it is sincere in its promise of climate action, should put a stop to this,” Bonifacio said.\n\nClimate emergency, loss and damage\n\nAksyon Klima Pilipinas, a civil society network for climate action, called on the national and local governments to declare a climate emergency, and mobilize more resources and support to scale up adaptation and mitigation programs nationwide.\n\nThe climate emergency declaration, according to the group, should reduce the country’s reliance on planet-warming fossil fuels, uphold climate justice, and ramp up actions to avoid and minimize loss and damage.\n\nLoss and damage refers to the costs that nations are already facing because of a warming world. According to the Department of Finance, climate-related hazards have caused P506.1 billion in losses and damage to the country from 2010 to 2020.\n\nAKP stressed that loss and damage should be part of the agenda in COP27 climate talks in Egypt this November. Developed nations blocked the establishment of a funding facility that will help vulnerable countries like the Philippines and instead opted to initiate a dialogue on the topic in future talks.\n\n“With every super typhoon or another extreme weather event striking the nation comes more loss and damage, some of which can never be recovered, and the cries of the earth and the poor that grow louder and louder,” it said.\n\nRE-powered future\n\nThe Power for People Coalition reiterated its call for the Philippines to be fully powered by renewable energy as the country reels from the impacts of Karding.\n\n“We know the climate emergency is happening because the world continues to use fossil fuels like coal and natural gas, despite warnings aired for decades that it would lead the world to disaster,” said Gerry Arances, convenor of P4P.\n\n“Yet despite our country being a punching bag for supertyphoons, successive governments, including the current Marcos administration, continue to expand the use of fossil fuels for our country. How many more supertyphoons must hit us before our government wakes up to facts? It’s time to act, and act quickly,” he added.\n\nThe Philippines generates 76.1% of its power from coal and natural gas. While the Marcos administration has made a shift to RE sources a priority, his government is pushing for the development of natural gas — or fossil gas — that groups said may hamper a genuine transition to clean energy.\n\nGreenpeace Philippine Lea Guerrero also said the Philippines should lead the call to hold the world’s biggest climate polluting business accountable and prioritize long-term, coherent plans for climate action.\n\n“If the climate crisis is our new normal, it's time to ask ourselves if this is something we want to merely accept and endure year in and year out—or if we want to call for accountability from those most responsible for carbon emissions, particularly fossil fuel companies,” she said.",
    "50 years after martial law, Filipino activists seek justice for abuses": "MANILA, Philippines — Survivors of torture and other atrocities under Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos on Wednesday marked his martial law declaration 50 years ago by pressing their demand for justice and an apology from his son — now the country’s president in a stunning reversal of fortunes for the once reviled family.\n\nActivists held street protests and a musical concert and unveiled a documentary at the state-run University of the Philippines. They say the events were aimed at preventing a repeat of the abuses and plunder that began after Marcos imposed martial law in the Philippines in September 1972, a year before his term was to end.\n\nThe dictator was ousted in an army-backed “People Power” uprising in 1986 and died three years later in U.S. exile without admitting any wrongdoing, including accusations that he, his family and cronies amassed an estimated $5 billion to $10 billion while he was in power.\n\nHis son, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who took office in June after a landslide electoral victory, delivered a speech at the U.N. General Assembly in New York on Tuesday. A small group of Filipino-American protesters hounded him and at one point managed to get close and booed him and repeatedly yelled “Never again to martial law!” as he alighted from a convoy and walked into a building with security escorts.\n\nHe or his key officials had not issued any statement about the martial law anniversary as of Wednesday afternoon.\n\nFor many of the survivors of abuses under Marcos, now mostly in their 70s and 80s, the anniversary brought back the trauma and painful memories of fellow victims, who either were killed by state forces or remain missing. They condemned efforts to gloss over the atrocities and portray the martial law years in pro-Marcos social media as a “golden era.”\n\n“The scars may have healed but deep inside, the anger and the sorrow are still there not just because I went through this but because so many good and patriotic people died resisting the dictatorship,” said Judy Taguiwalo, a former Cabinet official and women’s rights activist who was jailed for two years and tortured in the 1980s.\n\nTaguiwalo, 72, sought an apology from the president and asked him to “stop lying about the horrors of martial law.”\n\nMarcos Jr., 65, has refused such calls. In a TV interview last week, he said his father’s decision to declare martial law, suspend Congress and rule by decree was necessary to fight communist and Muslim insurgencies. He also said that describing the late president as a dictator is “wrong” and denied that he and his family were whitewashing history.\n\nBonifacio Ilagan, a left-wing activist who was detained for more than two years starting in 1974 and often beaten and severely tortured, said he could never accept Marcos as president. His sister was abducted by government agents with several other anti-Marcos activists in 1977 in metropolitan Manila and has never been found.\n\n“The trauma has returned with all its inhumanities,” Ilagan, 70, said, renewing his call for justice and a clear Marcos apology. “That’s the reason why I could not, for the life of me, say that he is my president.”\n\nLoretta Rosales, the former head of the independent Commission on Human Rights, was arrested with five other activists in 1976 by military agents and subjected to electrocution and sexual abuse.\n\nShe said that the president should comply with a provision of a 2013 law that she co-wrote as a member of Congress that calls for the documentation of the atrocities and the construction of a museum to memorialize the sufferings of thousands of people.\n\nThe legislation was used to compensate the victims of the abuses. Separately, a Hawaii court found the elder Marcos liable for rights violations and awarded $2 billion from his estate to more than 9,000 Filipinos led by Rosales who filed a lawsuit against him for torture, extrajudicial killings, incarceration and disappearances.\n\nThe 1986 ouster of Marcos was a high point, Taguiwalo said, but poverty, inequality, injustice and other social ills remained pervasive in the country decades after. That allowed political dynasties, including the Marcoses, to exploit the deep discontent to their advantage.\n\n“It’s not because as a people we are stupid or so forgiving,” Taguiwalo told The Associated Press. “I think the biggest lesson which we have always emphasized is that it’s not enough that you overthrow a dictator or return a certain extent of free press and academic freedom, civil and political rights.”\n\n“You need to show that democracy works for the majority of the people who should have jobs, land and a decent livelihood,” she said.",
    "Ian’s future remains murky; Cat 4 Noru hits the Philippines": "The long-term future of Tropical Storm Ian still remains frustratingly obscure, as computer models forecasting its track remain obstinately in disagreement. Rapid intensification of Ian into a major category 3 or 4 hurricane remains highly probable, but whether or not the storm will impact the heavily populated west-central coast of Florida – or the less populated Big Bend and Panhandle areas – remains a mystery.\n\nAt 2 p.m. EDT Sunday, Ian was 265 miles south-southeast of Grand Cayman, with top winds of 50 mph, headed west-northwest at 12 mph. Ian was bringing heavy rain showers to Jamaica and eastern Cuba, as seen on Cayman Islands radar. Satellite imagery early Sunday afternoon showed that the symmetry, organization, and intensity of the storm’s heavy thunderstorms were steadily increasing. Ian had the look of a storm well on its way to becoming a hurricane, and it may now have a vertically aligned core that will allow it to rapidly intensify.\n\nIntensity forecast for Ian\n\nIan has nearly ideal conditions for intensification through Monday night: very warm water of 30 degrees Celsius (86°F) with a high heat content, light wind shear, excellent outflow channels aloft, and a moist atmosphere (a mid-level relative humidity of 70%). However, data from the Hurricane Hunters on Sunday morning showed that Ian’s vortex was still not aligned in the vertical, with the upper-level center displaced from the surface center. A tilted configuration does not allow for much intensification, but satellite imagery from Sunday afternoon suggests that Ian had solved this problem.\n\nIntensification is predicted on Monday, when Ian will be passing by the Cayman Islands and approaching western Cuba. Crossing Cuba is likely to interrupt the intensification process only briefly, as the few hours Ian spends over Cuba will not significantly disrupt its core. Ian is likely to resume intensification over the warm waters of the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday.\n\nThe 11 a.m. EDT Sunday National Hurricane Center forecast for Ian was aggressive, explicitly predicting rapid intensification. Beginning at 8 p.m. EDT Sunday, when Ian will be south of Jamaica, NHC predicts Ian will go from a tropical storm with 65-mph winds to a category 2 hurricane with 105-mph winds in 24 hours, exceeding the minimum definition of rapid intensification (a 35-mph increase in winds in 24 hours).\n\nBut by Wednesday conditions for intensification will become marginal, as a southwesterly flow of upper-level winds to the west of Ian brings an increase in wind shear; the 12Z Sunday run of the SHIPS model predicted a moderate 15-20 knots of wind shear would affect Ian on Wednesday, when the storm is expected to be to the west of Tampa. With dry air to the west of Ian at that time, the higher wind shear and drier air may cause a weakening of the storm. Wind shear will continue to increase as Ian heads farther north, and many of the models predict rapid weakening just before landfall on Thursday or Friday, if landfall occurs in the Florida Panhandle. However, Ian would be able to push a storm surge to the coast greater than its winds at landfall might suggest, as we have seen with several landfalling hurricanes in the Gulf. Examples include Katrina in 2005 (category 3 at landfall) and Ike in 2008 (category 2 at landfall).\n\nNHC currently has Ian topping out as a category 4 hurricane with 130 mph winds Tuesday night through Wednesday morning, when it will be to the west of Key West, Florida. The 12Z Sunday run of the DTOPS model gave a 93% chance that Ian would intensify by 75 mph in 72 hours. The top two intensity models for making 4- and 5-days forecast in 2021, the HMON and the HWRF, predicted with their 12Z Sunday runs that Ian would reach category 4 or 5 strength with 140-160 mph winds on Wednesday.\n\nSee more It's not often that our office is called upon to assist with tropical operations. The @NHC_Atlantic has asked several offices in the PacNW to release extra weather balloons in order to help them forecast for Tropical Cyclone Ian. #Hurricane #HurricaneSeason2022 pic.twitter.com/Rgu7fdo9Ej — NWS Medford (@NWSMedford) September 25, 2022\n\nTrack forecast for Ian\n\nThe spread in model track solutions for Ian continues to be unusually large, despite the continuous surveillance of the Hurricane Hunters and a doubling of the number of upper-air balloon soundings preformed at over 40 U.S. locations beginning on Saturday. One trend of note, though: The models have stopped shifting westward with their solutions, reducing the odds that a landfall will occur west of the Florida Panhandle, and increasing the odds that Tampa Bay will see severe impacts. The 12 Sunday runs of two of our top track models, the European and UKMET, were particularly concerning, showing a landfall near or to the south of Tampa Bay.\n\nFigure 1. A “superensemble” plot valid at 8 pm. EDT Wednesday, September 28, showing the tracks from four different global models and their ensembles. Model runs were performed at 0Z Sunday, September 25, 2022. Since the time this plot was created, the 12Z Sunday run of the GFS model made an eastward shift, closer to the other models. (Image credit: Tomer Burg)\n\nThe location of Ian’s landfall in Florida will depend upon the strength and orientation of the trough of low pressure pulling the storm northwards, and there are significant model differences on this point. So far, for the limited amount of time Ian has existed, the GFS model has out-performed all the other models – and the official NHC forecast – but that is no guarantee that the model is making good long-term forecasts for Ian: The GFS was the poorest-performing top-six model for 4- and 5-day forecasts for Hurricane Fiona (Figure 3). Now is a good time to remember that hurricanes stray outside the boundary of the “cone of uncertainty” about one-third of the time.\n\nSee more Here is the last few runs of the GFS forecast model. It's slowly coming east towards the European model. Lets see if other 12z models follow as well. pic.twitter.com/CKMrHJGfTh — Nicholas Isabella (@NycStormChaser) September 25, 2022\n\nFigure 2. Track error (in km) for 1- to 5-day forecasts made for Hurricane Fiona, September 14-24, 2022. There was no clearly superior model, and the official NHC forecast was noticeably better than any model for 4- and 5-day forecasts. Data taken from Brian Tang’s website.\n\nWhich model should you trust?\n\nFor those puzzling over the various hurricane computer forecast models to figure out which one to believe, the best answer is: Don’t believe any of them. Put your trust in the National Hurricane Center, or NHC, forecast.\n\nAlthough an individual model may outperform the official NHC forecast in some situations, the 2021 National Hurricane Center Forecast Verification Report documents that overall, it is very difficult for any one model to consistently beat the NHC forecasts for track and for intensity.\n\nIn 2021, the official NHC track forecasts for Atlantic storms were tough to beat, and none of the individual models outperformed the official forecast at any time period, when compared to a “no-skill” model called CLIPER5 (Figure 2). The CLIPER5 model (which combines the word “climatology” and “persistence” to show the nature of the forecasts it makes) is tough to outperform at short-term forecasts, since a hurricane will tend to keep moving in the same direction and at the same speed as at its initial point (this is called persistence). For that reason, the skill curve in Figure 1 shows relatively low skill for NHC forecasts for short-term forecasts out to one day; skill increases for forecasts between one and three days, when persistence tends not to be a good forecast (hurricanes generally don’t move in a straight line at a constant speed for days on end). Beyond three-day forecasts, NHC forecast skill starts to drop off, as the CLIPER5 model starts weighting its forecasts using climatology, which becomes tougher to beat at long ranges.\n\nThe GFS model was the best model in 2021, followed by the European model. The HWRF, HMON, COAMPS-TC, and CMC models did respectably for forecasts up to 72 hours; at longer time periods, the CMC and COAMPS-TC models performed poorly. The official 2021 NHC Atlantic track forecasts tended to have a northeast bias of 7-21 miles for one- to three-day forecasts (i.e., the official forecast tended to fall to the northeast of the verifying position).\n\nFigure 3. Skill of the top computer model forecasts of Atlantic named storms in 2021, compared to a “no skill” model called CLIPER5 that uses only climatology and persistence to make a hurricane track forecast (persistence assumes that a storm will tend to keep going in the direction and at the same speed that it is currently going). OFCL=Official NHC forecast; GFS=Global Forecast System model; HMON=Hurricanes in a Multi-scale Ocean-coupled Non-hydrostatic regional model; HWRF=Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting model; Euro=European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) model; COAMPS=COAMPS-TC regional model. (Image credit: 2021 National Hurricane Center Forecast Verification Report)\n\nHere is a list of some of the top hurricane forecast models used by NHC:\n\nEuro: The European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) global forecast model\n\nGFS: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Global Forecast System model\n\nUKMET: The United Kingdom Met Office’s global forecast model\n\nHMON: Hurricanes in a Multi-scale Ocean-coupled Non-hydrostatic regional model, initialized using GFS data\n\nHWRF: Hurricane Weather and Research Forecasting regional model, initialized using GFS data\n\nCOAMPS: COAMPS-TC regional model, initialized using GFS data\n\nIf one averages together the track forecasts from three or more of these six models, the NHC official forecast will rarely depart much from it. These six models are used as input to various “consensus” models, such as “TVCN,” often referenced in NHC discussions for a storm. Improved consensus modeling techniques are one major reason NHC track forecasts have improved so much in the past 30 years.\n\nFigure 4.

(Image credit: NOAA/RAMMB/Colorado State University)\n\nTyphoon Noru shocks the Philippines with a Cat 4 landfall\n\nTyphoon Noru put on a spectacular, unexpected, and extremely dangerous rapid intensification feat in the waters just east of the Philippines on Saturday, becoming one of the fastest-intensifying cyclones in modern Earth history. Noru’s peak 1-minute wind strength, as gauged by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), increased from 50 mph (medium tropical-storm strength) at 2 p.m. EDT Friday to 155 mph (top end of the category 4 range) at 2 p.m. EDT Saturday. According to Jasper Deng, who manages tropical cyclone information at Wikipedia, this increase of 105 mph in 24 hours is the fifth largest in global records, topped only by Hurricane Patricia in the eastern Pacific in 2015 (120 mph), Typhoon Hagibis in the northwestern Pacific in 2019 (115 mph), Tropical Cyclone Ambali in the South Indian in 2019 (115 mph), and Tropical Cyclone Ernie in the South Indian in 2017 (110 mph). All of these record-intensifying tropical cyclones occurred in the past seven years. Warmer oceans from human-caused climate change greatly boost the odds of extreme rapid intensification events like these (see Jeff Masters’ 2020 post on such trends in the Atlantic).\n\nSee more #Noru is going to steal the crown from #Hinnamnor per JTWC's latest forecast and threaten central Philippines as a (mid-tier) Category 5 typhoon. pic.twitter.com/j9At33Ag01 — Minghao Zhou (@Minghao_Zhou) September 24, 2022\n\nNoru made landfall on the Philippines’ Luzon Island about 35 miles northeast of the capital of Manila shortly before 12Z (8 a.m. EDT) Sunday. At 12Z, the JTWC rated Noru as a category 4 typhoon with 130 mph winds – a decrease in winds of 20 mph compared to six hours earlier, at 6Z. Noru was on a west- to west-northwest track late Sunday local time that would take it about 30 miles north of Manila. This is unusually close for a strong typhoon to be passing to the city, whose metropolitan area has a population over 21 million: The database of storms from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) lists only six major (category 3 and stronger) typhoons that have passed within 50 miles of Manila. Noru’s small size may allow it to pass far enough north of Manila to limit winds there to tropical storm strength, but this heavily populated area should be prepared for potentially severe impacts from the typhoon.\n\nSee more Incredible storm surge in Polillo, Quezon, Philippines which was hit by the eyewall of #KardingPH / #Noru.pic.twitter.com/TiSH4di3br — Ben Noll (@BenNollWeather) September 25, 2022\n\nNoru will emerge into the South China Sea after spending about eight hours crossing over Luzon, whose rugged terrain of Luzon is expected to disrupt the typhoon to category 1 status. Re-intensification into a category 3 storm is expected by Tuesday night (U.S. EDT), when Noru will make landfall in central Vietnam.\n\nNoru is Earth’s second Cat 5 storm so far in 2022. The first was Super Typhoon Hinnamnor, which peaked with 160 mph winds at 8 a.m. EDT Tuesday, August 30, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). This year is running behind the usual pace for Cat 5s: The 1990-2021 average is 5.3 Cat 5s per year, according to ratings by the National Hurricane Center and Joint Typhoon Warning Center.\n\nTropical Storm Gaston dying near the Azores in central Atlantic\n\nTropical Storm Gaston, with sustained winds of 50 mph at 11 a.m. EDT Sunday, is expected to become post-tropical on Monday as it heads west at 12 mph away from the Azores Islands.\n\nTropical Storm Hermine dies in far eastern Atlantic\n\nTropical Storm Hermine became a post-tropical cyclone in the waters 580 miles north-northeast of the Cabo Verde Islands on Sunday morning. Hermine’s remnants are predicted to bring total rainfall amounts of 3 – 6 inches to the Canary Islands through Monday.\n\nOne other wave to watch: 99L\n\nA tropical wave in the central Atlantic, several hundred miles west of the Cabo Verde Islands, was designated Invest 99L by NHC. The wave is in a dry environment (mid-level relative humidity of 50%), but sea surface temperatures are warm and wind shear is moderate, which could allow some slow development. Satellite imagery showed that 99L had developed a broad surface circulation, but had a limited amount of disorganized heavy thunderstorm activity. The wave has only limited model support for development as it wanders mostly northwest at less than 5 mph, far from any land areas. In its 2 p.m. EDT Sunday Tropical Weather Outlook, NHC gave 99L 2-day and 5-day development odds of 20% and 30%, respectively.\n\nFigure 5.

(Image credit: The National Hurricane Center Storm Surge Risk Maps)\n\nSunday evening update: Increasing risk of a damaging storm surge in Tampa Bay\n\nWhile the exact track and intensity of Ian as it approaches Florida will determine whether or not Tampa Bay receives a damaging storm surge, the current NHC cone of uncertainty – combined with the current intensity forecast – gives Tampa Bay a high chance of receiving a damaging storm surge, characteristic of a category 1 hurricane or stronger. The National Hurricane Center Storm Surge Risk Maps are helpful to see the levels of inundation one might expect for various Saffir-Simpson category hurricanes, and they paint an alarming picture of how vulnerable the Tampa Bay region is (Figure 5). For a category 1 hurricane, the map shows that Pinellas County – home to St. Petersburg, and over one million people – may become completely cut off from the mainland. Portions of all four connecting bridges, as well as the main highway leading north – U.S. Highway 19 – will potentially be under as much as six feet of water. These evacuation routes would likely be cut off well before a hurricane arrives.\n\nFigure 6.

Beijing insists on bilateral talks with the Philippines.\n\n“China-Philippines relations are now at a new starting point,” he said.\n\nHe stressed that China is ready to work with the Philippines to implement the consensus reached by President Xi Jingping and President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to follow through on the blueprint for cooperation to jointly usher in a new “golden era” in bilateral relations.\n\n“We should preserve the friendship between China and the Philippines,” he added.\n\nThe ambassador highlighted Xi’s leadership of the Communist Party of China and China’s development.\n\n“It was a decade of opening up at a higher level and sharing development opportunities with the world,” Huang said. “It was a decade where China shouldered the responsibilities of a major country.”\n\nChina, he said, has opened wider and deeper with its contribution to world economic growth at more than 30 percent.\n\nHuang noted that the Belt and Road cooperation has yielded fruitful results with a large number of projects completed and actively participated in global governance and promoted “world peace and development.”",
    "UN Rights Office Slams Abuses in Philippines": "Click to expand Image Emily Soriano, holding a picture of her 15-year-old son who was gunned down in Manila in 2016, says she is turning to the International Criminal Court after failing for years to attain justice in the Philippines, June 2022. © 2022 Aaron Favila/AP Photo\n\nThe United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) released a report on September 13 calling on the Philippine government to address serious gaps on human rights, particularly regarding accountability for abuses linked to the “war on drugs.” The report highlighted several achievements of the UN and Philippines joint program on human rights, but underscored that impunity for rights violations and police abuses persists.\n\nThe Office of the High Commissioner said that it “continued to receive allegations of human rights violations by members of the Philippine National Police,” adding that “deaths continue to be reported in anti-illegal drug operations.” Since the “drug war” began in 2016, the government has itself reported that police killed more than 6,200 people in anti-drug operations, while OHCHR previously put the figure at more than 8,600. Domestic human rights groups estimate the “drug war” toll, including killings by unidentified gunmen, at three times the government figure. Virtually all of these killings remain uninvestigated.\n\nThe Office of the High Commissioner also said it “continued to receive reports of killings, arbitrary detention, physical and legal intimidation” against human rights defenders. It said these individuals are often targets of “red-tagging,” the longtime government practice of accusing activists of supporting the communist insurgency, putting them at risk of attack and arbitrary arrest.\n\nThe OHCHR report corroborated human rights groups’ findings that abuses have persisted even since the UN joint program started more than a year ago. Last week, Human Rights Watch submitted a policy paper to members of the UN Human Rights Council supporting a resolution to continue its rights monitoring and reporting mandate on the Philippines.\n\nThe OHCHR cited key obstacles to enforcing the UN joint program, including “limited oversight of human rights investigations, inadequate investigation capacity and inter-agency cooperation, limited forensic capacity and protracted judicial processes.” It also noted “inadequate victim and witness support and protection, and fear of reprisals” that undermine victims’ engagement in the program. Among the office’s recommendations is the need for “further progress on accountability.”\n\nWhat’s clear from the report is that the UN’s work on the Philippines is far from done. The Human Rights Council should adopt OHCHR’s recommendation that the high commissioner’s office continue to monitor and regularly report on the country’s rights situation. There’s no short-term solution to making real progress on accountability and providing justice for people in the Philippines.",

    "The AP Interview: Marcos wants to ‘reintroduce’ Philippines": "Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. speaks during an interview with The Associated Press, Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, in New York. (AP Photo/Julia Nikhinson)\n\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. speaks during an interview with The Associated Press, Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, in New York. (AP Photo/Julia Nikhinson)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — Looking to “reintroduce the Philippines” to the world, new President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has ambitious plans for his nation on the international stage and at home — if, that is, the twin specters of pandemic and climate change can be overcome or at least managed.\n\nAnd if he can surmount the legacies of two people: his predecessor, and his father.\n\nHe also wants to strengthen ties with both the United States and China — a delicate balancing act for the Southeast Asian nation — and, like many of his fellow leaders at the United Nations this week, called on the countries that have caused global warming to help less wealthy nations counteract its effects.\n\nMarcos, swept into office this spring , is already drawing distinctions both subtle and obvious between himself and his voluble predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, who alienated many international partners with his violent approach to fighting drug trafficking and the coarse rhetoric he used to galvanize supporters.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAsked if Duterte went too far with his lethal drug crackdown , Marcos redirected the criticism toward those who carried out the plan.\n\n“His people went too far sometimes,” Marcos told The Associated Press on Friday. “We have seen many cases where policemen, other operatives, some were just shady characters that we didn’t quite know where they came from and who they were working for. But now we’ve gone after them.”\n\nMarcos, 65, sat for a wide-ranging interview in New York on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly’s annual leaders’ meeting. Three months into his administration, he seemed energetic and enthusiastic — and eager to project his vision for the nation beyond its borders.\n\nOn Thursday, he met with U.S. President Joe Biden in a bid to strengthen the sometimes complicated ties that have ebbed and flowed between the two nations since the Philippines spent four decades as an American colony in the early 20th century.\n\n“There have been bits and pieces where they were not perhaps ideal,” Marcos said. “But in the end, that overall trajectory has been to strengthen and strengthen and strengthen our relationship.”\n\nIn addition to Duterte, Marcos also must draw distinctions between himself and the most iconic figure in the Philippines’ public sphere: his late father, whose name he shares. Ferdinand Marcos Sr., hero to some and plundering dictator to others, ruled from the 1960s to the 1980s, including a tumultuous period of martial law and repression. He made the family reputation an indelible part of Filipino history.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAddressing the family legacy directly is something the son has been loath to do, at least explicitly, though he vehemently rejects use of the term “dictator” to describe his father’s rule. To him, the political baggage of his parents is a remnant of the past.\n\n“I did not indulge in any of that political back-and-forth concerning the Marcos family,” he said. “All I spoke about was, ‘What are we going to do to get into a better place?’ And people responded.”\n\nEngaging, he said, would have simply been a retread — and an unnecessary one. “It doesn’t help. It doesn’t change anything,” he said. “So what’s the point?”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe elder Marcos placed the Philippines under martial law in 1972, a year before his term was to expire. He padlocked Congress and newspaper offices, ordered the arrest of political opponents and activists and ruled by decree. Thousands of Filipinos disappeared under his rule; some have never been accounted for.\n\nWhen it comes to his predecessor, Marcos treads a nuanced political line as well. Distinguishing himself from Duterte’s in-your-face rule can benefit him at home and internationally, but Duterte’s popularity helped catapult him into office, and the former president’s daughter Sara is Marcos’ vice president.\n\nThe extrajudicial killings associated with Duterte’s yearslong crackdown provoked calls that his administration should be investigated from the outside, and he vowed not to rejoin the International Criminal Court — a precept that Marcos agrees with. After all, Marcos asked, why should a country with a functioning legal system be judged from elsewhere?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“We have a judiciary. It’s not perfect,” he said. “I do not understand why we need an outside adjudicator to tell us how to investigate, who to investigate, how to go about it.”\n\nMarcos cast the coronavirus pandemic as many other leaders have — as a balancing act between keeping people safe and making sure life can push forward.\n\n“We took a very extreme position in the Philippines, and we eventually had the longest lockdown in any country in the world,” he said. “That was the choice of the previous government. And now, we are now coming out of it.”\n\nIn recent days, he has both removed a national mandate to wear masks outdoors and extended a “state of calamity” — something he said he didn’t necessarily want to do, but keeping the declaration in place allows more people to continue getting help.\n\n“It’s not very encouraging when people look at your country and they see, ‘Well, it’s under a state of calamity.’ That’s not good for tourists. It’s not good for visitors. It’s not good for business,” Marcos said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEncouraging ties with China , particularly given Beijing’s aggressive maritime policies, might be a daunting prospect for a nation so closely and historically aligned with the United States. But, Marcos says, it’s possible — and necessary.\n\n“It is a very fine line that we have to tread in the Philippines,” the president said. “We do not subscribe to the old Cold War ‘spheres of influence.’ ... So it’s really guided by national interest, number one. And second, the maintenance of peace.”\n\nPeace comes in many flavors. Last week, Marcos traveled to the southern part of the nation — a predominantly Muslim area of a predominantly Catholic country — to express support for a multiyear effort to help a onetime rebel group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, give up their guns and govern their autonomous region effectively.\n\nWhile Moro has come into the government fold, smaller militant groups including the violent Abu Sayyaf have continued to fight the government and wage sporadic attacks, especially in impoverished rural regions with weak law enforcement. Marcos dismissed Abu Sayyaf as a group that no longer has a cause other than “banditry.”\n\n“I don’t believe they are a movement anymore. They are not fighting for anything,” Marcos said. “They are just criminals.”\n\nMarcos did not specify precisely why the Philippines needed to be reintroduced, though the country’s image took a hit from 2016 to 2022 under the Duterte administration.\n\n“The purpose, really, that I have brought to this visit here in New York ... has been to try to reintroduce the Philippines to our American friends, both in the private sector and in the public sector,” he said.\n\nAnd after the pandemic truly ends, he said, the nation needs to find a fruitful path and follow it.\n\n“We have to position ourselves. We have to be clever about forecasting, being a bit prescient,” he said.\n\n“We do not want to return to whatever it is we were doing pre-pandemic,” Marcos said. “We want to be able to be involved and be a vital part of the new global economy, of the new global political situation.”\n\n___\n\nTed Anthony, AP’s director of new storytelling and newsroom innovation, was Asia-Pacific news director from 2014 to 2018, based in Bangkok.

(AP Photo/Aaron Favila, File)\n\nMANILA, Philippines -- A Philippine court has dismissed a government petition to declare the Communist Party of the Philippines and its armed guerrilla wing as a terrorist organization in a decision that officials vowed to appeal but was welcomed by activists who have long rejected the labeling of rebels as terrorists.\n\nManila regional trial court Judge Marlo Magdoza-Malagar’s ruling, signed Wednesday, is a legal victory for activists and government critics and a setback for security officials, who have long accused left-wing organizations of covertly serving as legal fronts for the Maoist guerrillas.\n\nThe court asked the government to fight the communist insurgency, one of Asia’s longest, with “respect for the right to dissent, to due process and to the rule of law.” It raised concerns over “red-tagging,” or linking activists to insurgents, which it said was a “pernicious practice” that endangers government critics.\n\n“While both rebellion and terrorism may involve the use of violence, the violence in rebellion is directed against government or any part thereof,” the court said in the 135-page decision. “Rebels in a rebellion always target agents of the state such as the military or the police.”\n\n“Terrorism, on the other hand, is directed against the civilian population with the intent to cause the latter extraordinary and widespread fear and panic,” the court said.\n\nRenato Reyes of Bayan, an alliance of left-wing groups, said, \"labeling revolutionaries and those engaged in peace negotiations as `terrorists’ is wrong, counter-productive and undermines any possibility of a political settlement in the armed conflict.”\n\nEmmanuel Salamat, a retired marine general who heads a government task force helping oversee efforts to end the decades-long insurgency, told reporters that he was saddened by the court decision because the rebels have committed acts of terrorism, including killings, for many decades.\n\n“This is like disregarding the sacrifices of our troops, the front-liners in the field, our heroes who gave up their lives,” he said. He cited the United States and other countries which have listed the rebel New People’s Army as a terrorist organization.\n\nJustice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla said the government would appeal.\n\nThe court assessed nine separate deadly attacks and acts of violence, including the burning of a chapel and rural houses in a province, which government witnesses said were carried out by communist guerrillas in the country’s south from 2019 to 2020. But it questioned the witnesses’ identification of the attackers as rebels based on their black combat uniforms and firearms.\n\nThe court also said that any fear the attacks may have sparked may have been confined to the communities where they occurred and did not reach the “widespread” and “extraordinary” panic of a terrorist strike described under Philippine law. “The nine incidents of atrocities fall within the category of small-time `hit-and-run’ attacks and sporadic acts of violence with no specified victims or targets,” the court said. It said authorities failed to establish that the attacks were committed to coerce the government to give in to a demand, a key element of terrorism as specified in the law.\n\nThe Maoist rebel force was established in 1969 with only about 60 armed fighters in the country’s northern region but it gradually grew and spread across the country.\n\nBattle setbacks, surrenders and infighting, however, have weakened the guerrilla group, which remains a key national security threat. The rebellion has left about 40,000 combatants and civilians dead and stunted economic development in provincial regions, where the military says a few thousand insurgents are still active.",
    "A Deep-Dive Into The 2022 Fleet Of Philippine Airlines": "With just 75 aircraft, the fleet of Philippine Airlines connects the Philippines to the Middle East, North America, and the Asia Pacific Region.\n\nThe flag carrier of the Philippines, Philippine Airlines, has an important role in connecting people to its country while also providing important air services between the various islands of the Philippine Archipelago. Today, we examine its fleet of 75 aircraft, where they're flying, and how this fleet is much smaller than it used to be.\n\nThe Philippine Airlines fleet at a glance\n\nA quick overview of the Philippine Airlines fleet shows us the following types and quantities:\n\n11x De Havilland Canada DHC-8-400\n\n13x Airbus A320-200\n\n22x Airbus A321-200\n\n8x Airbus A321neo\n\n9x Airbus A330-300\n\n2x Airbus A350-900\n\n11x Boeing 777-300ER\n\nThese figures also include aircraft operating under the carrier's regional subsidiary, PAL Express. This division is responsible for operating some of the carrier's Airbus A320s and A321s, as well as all the DHC Dash 8s.\n\nAdditionally, anyone who is familiar with the historical operations of the airline will see that the carrier's larger jets are absent. The carrier once flew big jets like the Airbus A340-300 and Boeing 747-400. Unfortunately, for big jet-lovers, the airline retired the former in 2018 and the latter in 2014.\n\nThe airline's fleet size over time.

With an average age of six years, these birds aren't too old. And if we dig deeper, we can see that a single Dash 8-400 is severely impacting the fleet's average age, as the aircraft registered RP-C3036 is about twenty-two and a half years old. This aircraft is currently parked, while the other 10 jets are listed as operational. The youngest of these turboprops are a little less than three years of age.\n\nWith the exception of RP-C3036, which has 76 seats, all other Dash 8-400s are fitted with a single class layout of 86 economy seats.\n\nThe airline's Dash 8 fleet is mostly used for island hopping across the Philippines archipelago. Photo: John Andrei Policarpio via Wikimedia Commons\n\nShort and medium-range narrowbody jets\n\nFor slightly higher-capacity operations and services that require more range than the Dash 8s are capable of, Philippine Airlines relies on its A320 and A321 narrowbodies.\n\nThe A320 fleet is mainly operated by PAL Express, which means these jets fly mainly domestic services within the Philippines. Meanwhile, the longer fuselage and longer-range A321s operate a mix of domestic and international routes.\n\nWhen it comes to international service, the A321s serve cities in the region such as:\n\nBangkok\n\nGuam\n\nKuala Lumpur\n\nPhnom Penh\n\nSingapore\n\nAirbus narrowbodies comprise the majority of the airline's fleet. Photo: Steven Agre via Wikimedia Commons\n\nHowever, both the A321-200s and A321neos are also tasked with some longer-range services, including flights to:\n\nBrisbane\n\nBusan\n\nHong Kong\n\nNagoya\n\nOsaka\n\nPort Moresby\n\nSeoul\n\nTokyo (Haneda and Narita)\n\nWhen it comes to age, the A320-200s are the oldest, with an average of 13 years. The A321-200s are a bit younger, with an average of about eight years. Meanwhile, the next-generation A321neos average just under four years of age.\n\nThe A321neo is the newest type in the Philippine Airlines fleet. Photo: Airbus\n\nThe Airbus A330-300\n\nNaturally, Philippine Airlines' collection of widebody aircraft serves the airline's longest routes. According to current FlightRadar24.com data, the carrier's destinations in the Middle East (Dammam, Doha, Dubai, and Riyadh) are served by some of its nine Airbus A330-300s. This fleet has an average age of just over eight and a half years and is configured with three classes - business, premium economy, and economy.\n\nThe Airbus A330 is also deployed on a series of rather interesting transpacific services. The first is the airline's Manila to Los Angeles service via Honolulu, which currently has flight numbers PR100/101 and PR113. The second is a Manila to Los Angeles service via Seoul, which operates as PR112. Digging a little deeper, it looks like PR112/113 sees an A330 fly from Manila to Seoul, then from Seoul to Los Angeles, then from Los Angeles to Manila via Honolulu. It's quite an interesting mix of stopovers, with Los Angeles to Seoul being offered as its own bookable fifth-freedom service.\n\nA shrunken A350 fleet?\n\nConfigured with 30 seats in business, 24 in premium economy, and 241 seats in economy, the A350-900s flying for Philippine Airlines are noticeably more premium-heavy than the A330s. This makes sense, considering the fact that the type is the carrier's newest and most modern widebody aircraft. While the airline now has just two A350s, this wasn't always the case.\n\nIndeed, anyone who has followed the Philippine Airlines fleet over the years will notice that the carrier once had six Airbus A350-900s. Considering the fact that this is a new and efficient type, a reduction in this particular fleet is more on the rare side - with LATAM and South African Airways being two other examples of carriers that have given up their A350s.\n\nIn the case of Philippine Airlines, the reduction of the A350 fleet by four jets was carried out due to the airline making its way through the bankruptcy process. This was done in the hopes of simplifying its operations and lowering expenditures. The four jets went to German airline Lufthansa, with that airline now operating 21 A350-900s.\n\nIn 2021, we reported that the airline also had plans to reduce its Boeing 777 fleet. Interestingly, however, it appears that the airline held on to these widebodies, with all 10 still listed as part of the carrier's fleet. At the same time, three of the 10 777s are currently listed as parked.\n\nDespite the smaller fleet, it looks like the decision to restructure and give up the A350s has paid off. Indeed, the past August saw Philippine Airlines post what it called \"record profits.\" The airline declared $1.1 billion in revenues for the first six months of 2022, which it says is a 258% improvement from the same period in 2021.\n\nThe Airbus A350-900 is the airline's flagship widebody. Photo: Airbus\n\nThe Boeing 777-300ER\n\nConfigured with just two classes, the Boeing 777-300ERs flying for Philippine Airlines have 42 seats in business class and 328 in the economy cabin. These high-capacity widebodies average just over eight and a half years and fly some of the airline's longest routes along with the A350s. Services include:\n\nNew York\n\nSan Francisco\n\nToronto\n\nand Vancouver\n\nInterestingly, in 2019, the airline was in discussions with Boeing to acquire two new Boeing 777X aircraft. The US planemaker was reported to be pushing the 777X as a replacement for two of the carrier's older 777-300ER aircraft. Since we reported on that plan in 2019, nothing has really developed further. The most likely reason for this lack of change are the events of 2020 and the negative financial impact it had on the carrier. The airline's oldest 777s are about 13 years old. While they are nowhere near factory fresh, the two jets at this age could probably operate reliably for at least a few more years - especially if well-maintained. This will work well for the carrier, as Boeing is still a few more years away from the 777X entering commercial passenger service. But do you think Philippine Airlines should eventually update its 777-300ER fleet to the 777-9? Or should it modernize with Airbus A350s instead?\n\nThe airline has 10 Boeing 777s which average just over eight and a half years. Photo: Aero Icarus via Wikimedia Commons\n\nTechnical stops and longer flights\n\nWith Philippine Airlines emerging from the bankruptcy process at the start of 2022 or end of 2021, the airline should have had very favorable conditions for turning a profit. While easing border restrictions and pent-up travel demand have helped greatly, the airline would face a new headwind due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nOn April 1st of this year, Philippine Airlines announced that it would be taking the precautionary measure of avoiding Russian airspace due to concerns related to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. The result of this circumvention of airspace results in a one-hour refueling stop and an overall longer routing and travel time over the Pacific. The jets departing New York JFK and Toronto Pearson both stopover at Vancouver International Airport to \"top up\" before the long flight across the Pacific. The carrier used to fly a fifth freedom service between Vancouver and New York, but this was discontinued in 2018.\n\nFlying east out of Manila, the carrier's PR126 and PR118 services continue to operate nonstop, from Manila to New York JFK, and nonstop from Manila to Toronto respectively. Due to prevailing winds, flights in this direction don't need to make a refueling stop in order to avoid Russian airspace. Philippines media outlet Journal News notes that the airline \"seeks the understanding of passengers for this necessary step, as safety and operational integrity remain the cornerstone of PAL operations.\" The airline says that it will revert to nonstop JFK-MNL and Toronto-MNL services as soon as operational issues are resolved.\n\nThe airline's Manila to JFK service ranks as the 8th longest route in the world this October, with a distance of 8,520 miles (13,712 km) and a block time of 16 hours and 15 minutes.\n\nFlying westward, aircraft departing Toronto and New York must refuel in Vancouver to avoid Russian airspace. Photo: GCMap.com\n\nSo there is your deep dive into the fleet of Philippine Airlines. The carrier's current list of long-haul, transcontinental destinations is much smaller than other flag carriers, but its very clear that the airline shines when it comes to domestic and regional connectivity, using its fleets of Dash 8 turboprops and A320 family aircraft.\n\nHave you flown with Philippine Airlines before?

    "Canada prefers FTA with Asean over bilateral deal with Philippines": "Canada has expressed preference for a free trade agreement with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) instead of one with the Philippines, dampening the hopes of some groups that a bilateral trade deal between the two countries will be forged.\n\nPeter MacArthur, Canadian ambassador to the Philippines, said this on Tuesday of last week at the sidelines of the press conference during the visit of the north American country’s’ minister of international trade, export promotion, small business and economic development, Mary Ng.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“The focus right now is on the Asean-Canada Free Trade Agreement (FTA),” MacArthur told the Inquirer, referring to the economic agreement which has been under official negotiations since November last year.\n\nEarlier this month, Canadian Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines president Julian Payne said the southeast Asian country should seek a free trade agreement with Canada.\n\nPayne cited it would benefit both countries in terms of tariff reductions.\n\nAsean-Canada trade\n\nHistorically, Asean has forged collective trade deals with different countries in the past and was successful, but such negotiations were often subjected to prolonged deadlocks due to the need for consensus from multiple members.\n\nEven within the Asean itself are informal coalitions of member states with competing and sometimes incompatible agenda.\n\nCiting Canada’s statistics, Asean said that bilateral trade relations between the two parties remained strong despite the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, with the total two-way merchandise trade reaching $19.9 billion during the said year.\n\nBy the end of 2020, the stock of foreign direct investments from Canada to Asean member states stood at $12.5 billion, while the stock of the same from Asean member states to Canada was $1.2 billion.\n\n“The FTA would strengthen Asean-Canada economic relations, connect Asean closer to the global value chains and improve market access for both Asean and Canadian firms,” said Asean Secretary General Dato Lim Jock Hoi in 2021 during the official launch of the negotiations between Canada and the regional bloc.\n\nPhilippine-Canada trade\n\nLast week, Ng highlighted that trade between Canada and the Philippines has grown in the last year, up by more than 30 percent in 2021 totaling about P121.2 billion or 2.8 billion Canadian dollars.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“What this really means in people terms is that trade helps create jobs for both our people, opening up new doors for small businesses and helping each other grow in our economies, which is so important at this time as we are all recovering from COVID-19,” Ng said during a press conference on the last day of her three-day visit.\n\nThe Canadian official also said their government would be providing P519.6 million in funding for the Philippines for three key development areas: climate finance, women empowerment and the Bangsamoro Normalization Trust Fund.\n\nCanada has provided P160.2 billion in development funds to the Philippines since the year 2000.

    "The Philippines and Israel: a history of agricultural exchange and cooperation": "The Philippines and Israel have a long history of friendship. During the Second World War, the Philippine government offered refuge to approximately 1,300 Jewish refugees fleeing the Nazi persecution of Jews in Europe. It was further deepened in 1947 when the Philippines supported the establishment of the State of Israel, being the only country in Asia to do so. These are the main historical pillars of Israel-Philippine relations, which paved the way for more partnerships between the two countries.\n\nL-R TAU President Dr. Max. P. Guillermo, Mayor Erlon C. Agustin of the Municipality of Camiling, and Ambassador Ilan Fluss. (Embassy of Israel in the Philippines)\n\nThe government of Israel has been working with the Philippines in several capacities including agriculture under the Center for International Development Cooperation (MASHAV), through the Center for International Agricultural Development Cooperation (CINADCO), and the Philippine- Israel Center for Agricultural Training (PICAT).\n\nFormer projects include working with the Bureau of Plant Industry (BPI) to introduce Israeli technology focusing on the microproduction of avocados, vegetables, and high value crops and later a program of collaborating was established with select state universities on training and upgrading the extension services to farmers.\n\n“What we are trying to do now is to create a partnership with the Department of Agriculture looking at the first stage in the areas of training and extension services through some of the centers of the Agriculture Training Institute (ATI),” Israeli Ambassador to the Philippines, His Excellency (H.E.) Ilan Fluss said.\n\nThe Embassy is in the process of planning and discussing how it can meet the needs of its Filipino partners in a more meaningful way, including conducting training and consultation, distributing Israeli agricultural technology, and sending both young farmers and industry experts to Israel for intensive and short training programs respectively.\n\n“We are trying to… support in areas that we believe we have expertise [in] and we can contribute [to],” he added. “Obviously, things have to be adjusted to the climatic conditions here… but… for me, the most important element to the partnership is approaching agriculture in a different way.”\n\nAside from introducing Israeli agriculture techniques and technology, the Embassy also aims to prove to Filipino farmers that working in agriculture can be profitable, even lucrative.\n\n“Agriculture, quite often, is seen here, especially by the smallholder farmers, as subsistence farming. Now, in Israel, subsistence farming would not exist. It’s a market economy, and the farmer has to make money. How do you make money? By improving your output and minimizing your input. Less expenses, maximum income,” H.E. Fluss said. “…what I’m trying to do is to share this approach, to share some of the best practices, and to share those technologies.”\n\nAn Israeli consultant giving advice on hydroponics. (Embassy of Israel in the Philippines)\n\nOngoing MASHAV programs\n\nThe Israeli embassy, through its many linkages in government and private sectors in the Philippines, have several programs currently ongoing under MASHAV.\n\nOne of its most popular ones is the Israeli Agricultural internship program, conducted in cooperation with the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) with support and oversight from the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Agriculture, which focuses on capacity building and the promotion of food security.\n\nAbout 500 young farmers or fresh agriculture graduates are sent to Israel annually. The paid internship lasts 11 months and includes both classroom and fieldwork. Participants are given the chance to experience how an Israeli farm works, from cultivation to marketing to pivoting according to changing times. “…the idea is… after they come back… to the Philippines… they change their mindset because they have been working with Israeli farmers, [which means] understanding that agriculture is sophisticated [and] has… to create an income.”\n\nThe agencies involved are currently trying to strengthen the reintegration of Israeli agriculture scholars in the country, which can be challenging as a number of students either use their training to get agriculture jobs overseas, or end up not working in the sector altogether. “…we would like to make sure that this program is contributing to the challenge here in the Philippines,” H.E. Fluss said.\n\nThe Embassy is also working with several state universities, including the Agricultural University of Tarlac, which is being provided with greenhouses, hydroponics setups, and training. “…the idea is really to do something localized and to help local farmers learn this approach.”\n\nAnother academic partner is Central Luzon State University (CLSU), who is working with MASHAV on an open field drip irrigation project. CLSU is also home to the Shalom Club, a global organization that all MASHAV scholars automatically belong to.\n\nH.E. Flusss at the1Bataan Agri Inno-Tech Center. (Embassy of Israel to the Philippines)\n\nPublic private partnerships\n\nThe Embassy values its linkages through both government and private sectors. “I work for (the) government, but at (the) end of the day… if you want something that will continue long term, I believe we have to put a lot of effort into the private sector, which is there to make money,” H.E. Fluss said. “…since we’re talking about the markets [and] the economy, we have to… work with the local private sector or with government or with cooperatives, but… working in an economic way for profit. And for that reason, I believe that PPP is very important because at the end of the day, you work together.”\n\nHe cited the 1Bataan Agri Inno-Tech Center (1Bataan AITC), a public private partnership between the province of Bataan and an Israeli agriculture company. The company is currently working with smallholder rice farmers using Israeli technology such as water pumps and drip irrigation to help them make more money by planting vegetables during the dry season, when rice cannot be cultivated.\n\n“We come from the Middle East. We have challenges of being in a drought-prone area… But with climate change and global warming, it’s becoming a global issue, so [it] makes sense in general to move to drip irrigation, but you have to make [relevant] calculations,” he said. “…The dry season is a long season, and in six months, you can get so many vegetables out of your land… So they’re working with the farmers exactly doing that.”\n\nThe partnership includes helping farmers surmount challenges such as finding direct markets for their harvests. “…it’s a whole concept changing in a way. How do… these smallholder farmers practice agriculture while not reducing and not affecting the production of rice, which is very important to the country, [while] …adding …high value crops which will bring an income to the farmer.”\n\nThe Ambassador recounted his recent visit to the 1Bataan AITC site: “I met some of the farmer who are into this project and it was amazing to see how proud they were because they’re doing something new, something different, and they’re also able to make some money. So for me, it is by showing to the public that they can do it differently.”\n\nHelping boost food security\n\nIsrael is known worldwide as a hub for innovation, including in the field of agriculture. It is in this regard that the Ambassador has been personally requested by the President of the Philippines to help the country’s agriculture sector.\n\n“Food security is a very important socioeconomic issue, so I’m very happy that we talked about it. We’re now working with the Department of Agriculture to identify where we should come in and what exactly to introduce,” H.E. Fluss shared.\n\n“At the same time, I’m also working with the private sector… What we’re trying to do is to [facilitate] introductions between Israeli private sector and the Philippine private sector and I can tell you that this is going very well.”\n\nThe Ambassador offered two examples of how Israeli technology has, or can be adapted to the Philippine culture and climate.\n\nFirst was a cacao project undertaken with a private company looking to expand the production of the traditional Criollo variety. “We don’t grow cacao in Israel, but we have expertise in the approach in some of the practices and when we enter into projects, we use experts from the agriculture sector but there are many elements to it,” the Ambassador explained.\n\nThe Filipino partner was introduced to an Israeli company that worked as a consultant, “introducing practices.., I would say the Israeli way, from checking the soil… to irrigation, [grafting procedures, and pest control].…”\n\nThe trees aren’t production ready yet, but according to the Filipino partner, “it looks very promising.”\n\nIsrael is also excited to be introducing their dairy technology to the Philippines. Israeli cows are the top milk producers in the world, with each cow producing an average of 30 liters a day, a far cry from the Philippines’ average of 9-11 liters a day. “We have dairy farms in the desert in Israel, so it’s about managing the climate, managing the cow.., the feed, and everything else, so I believe that if we introduce dairy farming, including technologies and the management system, then we’ll see a lot of milk and cheese which will be produced locally here in the Philippines.”\n\nSuch technologies, if properly applied, have the potential to positively impact the local dairy industry, which currently produces only 1% of the country’s needs.\n\nThe Embassy of Israel in the Philippines is looking forward to sharing Israeli dairy technology. (Embassy of Israel in the Philippines)\n\nChanging minds, changing lives\n\nMore important than the exposure to new technology is the hope for a change in mindset. The easiest way to encourage this is through proof of concept. “I believe that when you have successful agriculture, it will change mindsets,” H.E. Fluss said. “When farmers will start making money… they will upgrade their standard of living. They will be able to afford better living (conditions), better food, and they will be able to send their kids to be educated.”\n\nThe Ambassador emphasizes the need to tailor both technology and mindset to local climate and customs, as well as make the most of linkages between both public and private organizations. “…As a person who is working in creating bridges between Israel and the Philippines… It’s very important for me to always emphasize that I’m introducing Israeli practices. I’m introducing Israeli technologies and Israeli mindset. Now, the challenge is… what you take out of it and what can be implemented in the Philippines. And for this, I must work in a partnership… so I need a very good strong local partner who will guide me… and this is why development is a big challenge.”\n\nWhat H.E. Fluss hopes to achieve cooperation and progress. “My vision is to see bridges of innovation and technology between Israel and the Philippines… including in agriculture… [To bring] Israeli innovation… Israeli technologies… the Israeli mindset, and then… adjusting to local… needs… and implementing it in the Philippines. And I would like to say that… by the end of my term and beyond, you’ll be able to see that the farmers are… making money [and are]… using this income for the benefit of their standard of living [and] for the education of their children… This is what I would really like to see.”\n\nRead more about farming and gardening at agriculture.com.ph",
    "No sighting in northern Philippines of Chinese rocket debris": "Philippine officials are warning of potential danger to aircraft and ships from debris from a new Chinese rocket launch that might fall in northern Philippine waters\n\nMANILA, Philippines -- Philippine officials have warned of possible danger to aircraft and ships from debris from a new Chinese rocket launch that might fall in northern Philippine waters, authorities said Thursday, adding no debris has been sighted so far.\n\nThe Philippine Space Agency said China’s Long March 7A rocket was launched Tuesday night from the Wenchang Space Launch Center on Hainan island. That prompted the agency to notify Philippine authorities of potential danger in two offshore areas where the debris could crash down.\n\nThe possible “drop zones” were 71 kilometers (44 miles) off Burgos town in Ilocos Norte province and 52 kilometers (32 miles) from Santa Ana town in Cagayan province, the space agency said, citing information from a notice to pilots released by the Civil Aviation Administration of China.\n\nRocket parts that detach before reaching space should by design fall back offshore less than an hour after a rocket launch, Philippine Space Agency spokesperson Tricia Zafra said.\n\n“So far, no sighting. We continue to seek out reports,” Zafra told The Associated Press. “Hopefully, no injuries or damage related to it.”\n\nThe Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines warned Wednesday in a notice to pilots about the possible danger posed by the debris in the two northern Philippine offshore areas.\n\n“While debris from CZ-7A is unlikely to fall on land features or inhabited areas in the Philippine territory, falling debris still poses a considerable threat to ships, aircraft, fishing boats, and other vessels that will pass through the drop zones,” the Philippine Space Agency said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nIn July, the core stage debris of a Long March 5B rocket that was launched by China landed in Philippine waters in an uncontrolled reentry, the agency said. No damage or injuries were reported.\n\nFishermen at the time found a torn metal sheet showing part of the Chinese flag and a marking of the Long March 5B rocket in the West Philippine Sea about 160 kilometers (100 miles) off Mamburao town in Occidental Mindoro province, according to the space agency, using the Philippine name for a part of the South China Sea closer to its western coast.\n\nThe agency asked the public on Tuesday to immediately inform authorities if suspected floating debris is sighted at sea and warned people against retrieving or coming in close contact with such materials.\n\nManila’s space agency says it’s working with the Department of Foreign Affairs to push for the Philippine ratification of two U.N. treaties, including one that promotes accountability among nations for possible damage or injuries arising from the launching of objects such as satellites to space.\n\nChina has faced criticism for allowing rocket stages to fall to Earth uncontrolled at least twice before.

    "Philippines: Strong UN Human Rights Council Action Needed": "Click to expand Image Progressive groups protest during the inauguration of Ferdinand Marcos Jr. as president of the Philippines, in Manila, June 30, 2022. © 2022 Sipa via AP Images\n\n(Geneva) – The United Nations Human Rights Council should adopt a strong resolution addressing the dire human rights situation in the Philippines during its 51st session, which starts September 12, 2022, Human Rights Watch said today.\n\nIn a policy paper submitted to UN member states, Human Rights Watch said that extrajudicial killings in the Philippine government’s “war on drugs” still occur on a regular basis. Dahas, a program of the Third World Studies Center of the University of the Philippines, has reported 72 drug-related killings after President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. took office on June 30. Official government figures indicate that the police killed 71 people since August 2021, bringing the total number of killings reported by the police between July 2016 and May 2022 to 6,252. President Marcos has not repudiated abuses in the “drug war,” which he said he would continue.\n\n“UN member states should not be fooled by the baseless claims from the new Philippine government that the rights situation has suddenly improved,” said Lucy McKernan, Geneva director at Human Rights Watch. “Continued UN scrutiny of the Philippines is vitally important because ‘drug war’ killings are still common and police impunity for rights violations remains the norm.”\n\nThe Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) calculated in its report to the Council that the death toll was at least 8,663. Domestic human rights groups and the government appointed Philippines Commission on Human Rights state that the real figure of “drug war” killings is possibly triple the number reported in the OHCHR report.\n\nSince the “drug war” began in July 2016 under former President Rodrigo Duterte, the authorities have investigated very few killings implicating the police or alleged government agents. Only 12 police officers have been indicted and only one case, the video-recorded murder of 17-year-old Kian delos Santos in August 2017, resulted in the conviction of police officers.\n\nThe prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) was authorized in late 2021 to investigate alleged crimes against humanity in the “drug war.” In November, the ICC paused the investigation after the Justice Department provided information to the court claiming that the department was conducting a serious independent review of 52 cases involving the police. In June, the ICC prosecutor asked the court to allow his inquiry to continue because the Justice Department review was insufficient and failed to satisfy the requirements to defer the ICC investigation.\n\nOther grave abuses are also continuing, including harassment and extrajudicial killings of activists, environmentalists, journalists, and other human rights defenders, Human Rights Watch said. A long-running “red-tagging” campaign, in which government officials accuse people of links to the armed communist insurgency, further constricts fundamental freedoms and puts those targeted at grave risk of assault or arrest.\n\nPresident Marcos should take immediate steps to improve the human rights situation, Human Rights Watch said. He should release former Senator Leila de Lima, who has been held in police detention for more than six years on spurious drug charges. And he should appoint independent human rights experts as commissioners to the government Commission on Human Rights so that it can investigate and help prosecute human rights violations.\n\nIn 2020, the Human Rights Council passed a resolution that created the UN Joint Program to improve the capacity of Philippine institutions to protect human rights. But more than a year into the three-year program, it is still grappling with organizational and administrative issues, including government actions to thwart the participation of civil society organizations.\n\nUN member states at the Human Rights Council should recognize that the persistence of the human rights crisis in the Philippines makes it important to adopt a strong resolution during the 51st session, Human Rights Watch said. The resolution should create expanded human rights monitoring mechanisms and continue the UN Joint Program. The resolution should explicitly request continued reporting by the OHCHR on the situation in the country.\n\nSuch a resolution should call on President Marcos to unequivocally end the “war on drugs” and to prioritize accountability for unlawful killings and other abuses. It should urge the government to form a “truth commission” that will gather testimony from witnesses and victims and their families and make recommendations for achieving justice and ensuring payment of reparations.\n\nThe resolution should also call for stopping the practice of “red-tagging” activists and critics of the government, and halting the harassment of journalists and online activists with threats of arrests or criminal libel cases. It should also urge Marcos to release de Lima, to name independent human rights experts to the Commission on Human Rights, and to facilitate the full participation of civil society organizations in the UN Joint Program.\n\n“UN member states should make sure they don’t drop the ball on the Philippines and instead strengthen the Human Rights Council’s efforts to improve human rights in the country,” McKernan said. “Filipinos who suffered the most during the Duterte administration are looking to the Human Rights Council to help them achieve justice for themselves and their loved ones.”\n\n\n\nTo read the policy paper submitted to the member-states of the UN Human Rights Council ahead of the Council's 51st session, please click here.",

    "IKEA considering more stores in the Philippines": "SWEDISH furniture retailer IKEA is looking to establish more stores in the Philippines to address growing local demand and as part of its expansion efforts.\n\nGeorg Platzer, IKEA Philippines store manager, said that the retailer is studying more stores in Metro Manila in addition to its first branch in the country. IKEA Philippines opened the doors to its Pasay City store on Nov. 25 last year.\n\n“We need to have a second, and maybe even a third store in Metro Manila to cover the needs of the many consumers coming. No timing yet, no place yet but definitely on the expansion, it is on the drawing table,” Mr. Platzer said in an interview at the sidelines of a seminar in Pasay City last week.\n\n“The Pasay City store is the beginning for IKEA in the Philippines and there’s a future of more stores to come. It is just a matter of time. Because it is a big market, it is a growing market and in one moment, this store will be even too small to host so many people,” he added.\n\nIn terms of IKEA’s expansion outside of Metro Manila, Mr. Platzer said that the idea is “far from the pipeline.”\n\n“IKEA needs a certain amount of visitation. We live from visitation. We need a lot of visitors. Outside of Metro Manila, there [are] not enough people. And, if there [are] enough people, they need to travel a long way to come to IKEA. So, that would be a hindrance. We can think about cities like Cebu and maybe Davao, but I think that’s about it,” Mr. Platzer said.\n\nHowever, Mr. Platzer said that IKEA Philippines plans to add more “fulfillment areas” to serve more consumers buying online. The areas are where customers can pick up the products they purchased online.\n\n“We are about to stretch our fulfillment areas… In the future, we are going to serve more of the islands. Customers hopefully from Iloilo and Leyte can order online,” Mr. Platzer said.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Platzer said that IKEA Philippines had raised the prices of some of its products due to the depreciation of the Philippine peso versus the US dollar. He did not provide specific figures or products that had price increases.\n\nOn Sept. 23, the peso dropped to a new all-time low of P58.50 versus the greenback.\n\n“It’s a drama for us. The US dollar is too strong because we pay everything in dollars. We buy our goods in US dollars and that is not good,” Mr. Platzer said.\n\n“We always try to keep the prices as low as possible, and we still do. We still believe we have the lowest possible price in the country for this quality. But the whole currency challenge globally, the war in Europe with Russia and Ukraine, all these challenges have an impact on the supply chain and the prices,” he added. — Revin Mikhael D. Ochave",
    "Philippines’ Marcos Seeks Russian Fuel as Inflation Bites": "(Bloomberg) -- The Philippines is talking to Russia about buying fuel and other key commodities because the country’s national interest overrides potential concerns over the war in Ukraine, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said in an interview with Bloomberg TV.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nNoting that the Philippines can’t be complacent in relying on traditional suppliers, Marcos said the Southeast Asian nation was having conversations with Russia and other countries to diversify its supply chain for food stuffs and agricultural necessities like fertilizer to keep prices down.\n\n“Now maybe we need to approach Russia, say that maybe they can loosen up and provide us with fuel,” Marcos said on Friday afternoon from New York, where he is attending the United Nations General Assembly. He added that the Philippines was “close” to striking agreements with Russia and others.\n\n“The political side of it has been a little tricky, but nonetheless, the national interest comes first,” he said, when asked about US-led sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. “We need to find those new sources of fuel. But that applies not only to fuel, it applies to things like feed, fertilizer, other inputs that are just critical for us.”\n\nThe comments come after a hectic week of global diplomacy in New York where US President Joe Biden and other G-7 leaders tried to gain more international momentum for a campaign to sanction and isolate Russia over its war in Ukraine. The comments from Marcos, who met with Biden this week, reflect the difficult choices facing leaders in many developing nations as rising prices drive people into poverty.\n\nMarcos’s economic team is aiming for growth of at least 6.5% annually through 2028, bringing the country back to its pre-pandemic expansion levels. A broad reopening from what was among the world’s strictest pandemic lockdowns has supported economic recovery.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuring his election campaign, Marcos Jr. was dogged by the human rights abuses and corruption during the 21-year rule of his father, who placed the nation under martial law 50 years ago. The president said his election indicates the nation has now “moved forward.”\n\n“The last election has really given us the direction the people want us, the government, to take the Philippines and that is to economic prosperity,” Marcos said. “Best politics is still performance. And that’s how you move forward, you perform well.”\n\nInflation Surge\n\nStill, the country is facing economic challenges, with the surge in commodities pushing inflation above target in a nation that imports goods from oil to wheat. That’s aggravated by the peso’s slump to a record low. The central bank has raised interest rates by 225 basis points so far this year to tame inflation.\n\nRead more: Philippines Signals More Rate Hikes, FX Moves to Defend Peso\n\nThe nation has also experienced shortages in food items including sugar and onions. Marcos made the rare move of helming the agriculture department, as he seeks to deliver on his campaign pledge of food sufficiency.\n\nSpeaking before members of Asia Society in New York, Marcos said that despite the challenging environment “the Philippines remains on track to graduate to upper middle-income-country status by next year.”\n\n“With steady investments in infrastructure, agriculture, food security, public health, education, and other social services, we seek to become a high-income country, with zero extreme poverty, by the year 2040,” he said.\n\n(Adds Marcos’s comments in seventh, eighth paragraphs; his speech before Asia Society in final two)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",

    "The Philippines: UN human rights report looks to new administration for progress on accountability and reforms": "GENEVA (13 Sept 2022) – Amid continuing reports of human rights violations and abuses in the Philippines, including in the context of anti-drug operations, victims still face challenges in seeking justice, a UN report published today finds.\n\nIn the report, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights acknowledges the Government’s commitment to cooperate with the UN human rights mechanisms, including through an innovative UN joint programme on human rights that is being implemented with Government agencies, the national human rights institution and civil society.\n\nThe Joint Programme, signed in July 2021, provides technical assistance and capacity-building for reforms in six key areas, including: domestic investigative and accountability measures; data gathering on alleged police violations; the establishment of a national mechanism for reporting and follow-up; civic space and engagement with civil society and the Commission on Human Rights; counter-terrorism legislation; and human rights-based approaches to drug control.\n\nThe report, mandated by Human Rights Council resolution 45/33, calls for the new Philippines administration to adopt a transformative approach that looks to rights-based solutions for critical issues, including drug law enforcement and counter- terrorism, and to end divisive rhetoric that puts human rights defenders at risk.\n\nWhile acknowledging some progress in a number of areas, the report notes that considerable challenges remain.\n\n“The Government took some initiatives to advance accountability for human rights violations and abuses… However, access to justice for victims of human rights violations and abuses remained very limited. Institutional and structural shortcomings in law enforcement and the judiciary remained, despite efforts to address some cases,” it says.\n\nSpecifically, the report highlights “limited oversight of human rights investigations, inadequate investigation capacity and inter-agency cooperation, limited forensic capacity and protracted judicial processes”. Inadequate support and protection for victims and witnesses, as well as fear of reprisals, also affects victims’ engagement.\n\nTo address these concerns, the report recommends that the Interagency Review Panel, established by the Department of Justice, should accelerate its review of all killings related to the Government’s anti-drug operations. The Panel should also ensure that relevant findings are acted on promptly, including through internal administrative and criminal processes.\n\nWhile some cases have been investigated, these have so far not resulted in convictions and redress for victims.\n\nThe report calls on the Government to revise drug legislation and policies in line with human rights norms and international guidelines on human rights and drug policy; to revisit the mandatory penalties for drug offences; and to consider the decriminalization of drug possession for personal use.\n\nThe report also recommends that the Government pass proposed legislation on human rights defenders, and implement measures to protect civic space for them to be able to play their legitimate role securely and without reprisals.\n\nCritically, it calls on the Government to take all necessary steps to ensure the continued independence of the Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines, including through a transparent and consultative appointment process for Commissioners in line with the Paris Principles.\n\nThe report calls on the Human Rights Council to support the UN Joint Programme and to continue to monitor the situation closely, including progress on accountability.\n\nENDS",

There are not many providers that offer cold chain service for the Malaysian market and it is considered a niche market. Malaysia has established itself as the halal industry hub, making it one of the major trading partners of halal meat and other products. In the review period 2016-2021P, the Malaysia cold chain market has increased at a positive CAGR of 6.9% primarily due to substantial government investments in the freight industry and increase in retail and consumer spending especially in meat and seafood, fruits/vegetables market, and the growing pharmaceuticals industry.\n\nQatar Cold Chain Market Outlook To 2026 - Driven By FIFA World Cup 2022's Logistics Demand And Infrastructural Growth Along With A Tailwind Of Technological Development, Qatar Cold Chain Market Experiencing Growth\n\nThe cold chain market in Qatar is at the growth stage. It has established its position as an important import hub for the GCC countries (after UAE). Most of the goods are transported to the GCC countries after reaching Qatar. The high dependence of the country on imports to meet its food requirements has decreased over the past years and has necessitated the development of cold chain facilities to store domestically produced perishable products. In the review period 2016-2021P, the Qatar cold chain market has increased at a positive CAGR of 5.8% primarily due to substantial government investments in the freight industry and increase in retail and consumer spending especially in meat and seafood, dairy market, and the growing pharmaceuticals industry.\n\nUAE Cold Chain Market Outlook to 2025 – The Cold Chain Market in UAE is Thriving with the Advent of Government's Economic Diversification Plans Coupled with UAE's Increasing Adoption of Technology and Automation\n\nThe cold chain market in UAE is at growth stage. It has consolidated its position as a global transhipment hub due to its central location in the GCC region. The high dependence of the country on imports to meet its food requirements has necessitated the development of cold chain facilities. In the review period 2015-2020, the UAE cold chain market has increased at a positive CAGR of 5.0% largely due to heavy government and direct foreign investments in transportation and storage infrastructure, increase in retail and consumer spending especially in groceries, dairy, meat, international food and EXPO 2020.\n\nIndia Agricultural Cold Storage Industry outlook 2025 - An assessment of demand - supply infrastructure across value chain\n\nWhile the capacity of cold storage solutions has improved considerably at an aggregate level (XX Mn MT in 2020), there is a lack of cold chain infrastructure at farm-gate and transportation level. Snapshots on cold storage solutions of top 5 capacity states – Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Gujarat, Punjab and Andhra Pradesh and certain select states – Maharashtra, J&K & Himachal Pradesh, further indicate the inefficiencies as a single commodity storage unit and emphasize on lack of modern technology (controlled atmosphere, pre-conditioning rooms) of such units.\n\nCompetition Benchmarking of Top Logistics Players in Indonesia in Transportation, Warehousing, Cold Chain, 3PL, Express, E-Commerce, Automotive, Pharma and Retail Logistics\n\nThe industry is dominated by Sea and land freight Movements considering its huge import and Exports with Asian countries such as China and India. The country has strong trade relations with Australia, European countries, US, and neighboring South East Asian countries such as Thailand and Vietnam. No international freight is by Land due to its geographical limits. Airfreight is quite expensive than any other Mode and is usually used for Express Shipments. Indonesia also has a strong warehousing market segment with huge space catered by warehousing players and renting out at quite high rates. Warehouses are concentrated in areas of Greater Jakarta, Surabaya and Makassar due to high population and presence of Seaports. The Courier, Express, and Parcel market is driven by growth in Last-Mile deliveries and the E-Commerce segment in the country.\n\nAbout Us:\n\nKen Research is a research based management consulting company.

    "Bangsamoro Peace and the U.S.-Philippines Alliance": "Editor’s Note: The United States has long worked with the Philippines on both counterterrorism and regional security issues such as the rising threat of China, but these issues often followed different tracks. Brian Harding and Haroro Ingram of the U.S. Institute of Peace argue that the new government in the Philippines and the Bangsamoro peace effort offer an opportunity for the United States to engage in peacemaking and, in so doing, cement U.S.-Philippines security cooperation.\n\nDaniel Byman\n\n***\n\nThe election in May of Ferdinand Marcos Jr. as the 17th president of the Philippines presents an opportunity to reset U.S.-Philippines relations after six rocky years while President Rodrigo Duterte held the office. After Marcos’s sweeping election victory, President Biden called to congratulate him and then dispatched a series of U.S. officials to Manila, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Any concerns that the Marcos family’s corruption and lingering legal issues in the United States would hold up relations have been pushed aside due to the enormous interests the United States has in a functioning U.S.-Philippines alliance.\n\nDuring this honeymoon period, the Biden administration has prioritized reaffirming commitments under the Mutual Defense Treaty and Visiting Forces Agreement, which are fundamental to U.S.-Philippines defense cooperation and were often uncertain during Duterte’s tenure due to the former president’s hostility toward the United States and his attempts to deepen relations with Beijing. For the United States, the Marcos administration’s approach has been a breath of fresh air and has given U.S. officials hope that the United States will have reliable access to Philippines military facilities and that defense cooperation will increase in the coming years.\n\nHowever, the United States should be clear-eyed about the spectrum of threats that Manila sees. While the Philippines harbors deep concerns about China in the South China Sea, it is internal threats to the country’s stability that remain Manila’s priority and the overwhelming focus of its armed forces, often to the frustration of its U.S. alliance partners. But the reality is that until the Philippines is at peace internally—most importantly in Mindanao—Manila will be unable to focus adequately on the issues at the top of Washington’s agenda.\n\nFortunately, a hopeful but fragile peace process is underway in Mindanao. The initiative has the greatest potential in living memory to deliver a lasting peace, which would eliminate key drivers of poverty, instability, and violent extremism—and, strategically, would remove a major domestic demand on the Philippines’ security forces. While the United States has been engaged in a counterterrorism mission in Mindanao for more than two decades, it has not dedicated time and resources to peace efforts, despite strong interest from local parties. It’s time it did. Supporting a sustainable peace in the country’s south is an opportunity for strengthening the U.S.-Philippines alliance that is almost entirely divorced from high-level politics but would do much to shift Manila’s priorities.\n\nAn Opportunity for Peace in the Bangsamoro\n\nAfter decades of bloody conflict and cycles of failed peace efforts that spawned violent extremist breakaway groups in their aftermath, a peace deal between the Philippines government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) led to the establishment in 2019 of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), often referred to locally as “the Bangsamoro.” The BARMM’s approximately 5 million citizens are overwhelmingly Muslim, and its establishment marks the most significant endeavor since the arrival of the Spanish over 400 years ago for an autonomous polity in the Philippines’ Muslim heartland. However, while the peace process holds promise, it remains fragile.\n\nThe Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA), a body jointly appointed in 2019 by the MILF and the central government, to govern the BARMM until its first elections in May 2022, was faced with an unenviable task: build a government from scratch on the archipelago’s most impoverished and conflict-ridden island, amidst the coronavirus pandemic. By March 2021, it was clear that the two-track peace process—in which the first track was working toward establishing the new, autonomous government and the second on demobilizing and disarming more than 40,000 MILF combatants—would not meet its objectives within the three-year transition period. With less than a year remaining in the original transition period, President Duterte signed into law a three-year extension of the transition period on October 28, 2021.\n\nDespite now having until May 2025 to complete the transition and prepare for the BARMM’s first elections, the pressure on the BTA, as well as the national government and their international partners, has intensified. Expectations are high because the current moment represents a historic opportunity to finally achieve a sustainable peace in a region where wars have killed more than 100,000 Filipinos and traumatized generations. In the BARMM, impatience and high expectations among the population are putting pressure on local authorities. These pressures have created divisions within the MILF that threaten not only to fracture the group, and with it the MILF-dominated BTA, but also to fuel outbreaks of violence that could derail peace efforts.\n\nMore broadly, there remains a constant threat of conflict in the region. While clan wars (rido) regularly displace thousands of people each month, unravel the social fabric, and hamper economic development, it is grinding insurgencies by Islamic State-affiliated groups that locals cite as the greatest violent threat to the peace process.\n\nAll of the Islamic State’s affiliates in the Philippines operate in the BARMM. The most prominent of these is the Dawlah group in Lanao del Sur that was responsible for the 2017 Marawi Siege and is led by Abu Zacharia, who is reportedly the current emir of Islamic State East Asia (ISEA) province. Other affiliates include a faction of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) in Maguindanao and splinter groups in the Sulu archipelago that broke away from the Abu Sayyaf Group. By almost all accounts, these violent extremist groups are less active and more fragmented than they were when the Islamic State declared its East Asia province several years ago, thanks to constant operations by the Philippines military and local populations trying to give peace a chance. Nonetheless, these groups are eager to spoil the governance transition and are constantly seeking openings to gain legitimacy as the BTA faces challenges in its efforts to establish an administration that delivers gains for the population.\n\nThe U.S. Interests in Peace\n\nWhile peace in the Bangsamoro is fragile, there are more reasons to be optimistic than pessimistic about its prospects. High expectations across the BARMM’s communities reflect their hopes that the BTA will deliver on promises of basic services, security, and improved economic conditions. It is also clear that the BTA has tried to learn from the first three years of the transition and institutionalize those lessons to improve its performance in the time remaining. Concerns that there would be tensions between the Marcos administration and the MILF’s ministers in the BTA appear to have been assuaged, at least for now, with the BTA’s appointment of new ministers in August and the president’s public support for peace efforts.\n\nTo date, U.S. government support for the peace efforts in the Bangsamoro have been extremely limited. U.S. government officials are rarely seen in the BARMM, in contrast to representatives of U.N. agencies and the governments of Japan, Australia, and European countries, which have invested heavily in the peace process. In our meetings with senior members of the BTA in recent months, many wondered aloud about why the United States has not been engaged despite a clear U.S. interest in peace and the United States’ unique, though troubled colonial history in Mindanao. Local authorities are also interested in working with Washington on account of the U.S. government’s stature in Manila, which is greater than that of other international partners, and see it as a potentially influential interlocutor.\n\nThe United States could also gain from increased involvement in the peace process. Support for the transition in the works in the Bangsamoro could serve U.S. foreign policy interests in the region in two important ways. First, achieving peace would help address the root causes of why the United States has been engaged in a counterterrorism mission in Mindanao since 9/11. In 2003, when there was no viable peace process in place, the U.S. government asked the U.S. Institute of Peace to help facilitate a peace initiative, but it has not been engaged in such an endeavor since.\n\nSecond, a sustainable peace in the southern Philippines would remove a major domestic demand on the Philippines military’s resources and would allow it to reorient its policy focus toward external security. From the Pentagon’s perspective, the continued investment in ground forces and counterinsurgency is frustrating given the obvious maritime threats that the Philippines face from China. Until there is confidence in a sustainable peace, this dynamic will persist.\n\nA Crucial Three Years\n\nWith time ticking down before the deadline for the BTA to cede power to an elected government, the window of opportunity to ensure a successful transition and a sustainable peace is closing. Whether the BTA can confidently hand over power and complete the demobilization of MILF combatants will be key measures of success. With Islamic State-affiliated spoilers waiting in the wings and undermining the process, success is far from certain.\n\nThis three-year window presents an opportunity for the United States to engage. The BTA and key Bangsamoro civil society organizations are urgently seeking international training and advice on best practices for conflict prevention, reconciliation, peace messaging, returnee reintegration, and peacebuilding approaches to preventing and countering violent extremism. The BTA also suffers from a basic lack of data on the attitudes and circumstances of the people of the BARMM, which has led to poorly informed public policy. The United States can help provide resources and expertise to help facilitate this transition.\n\nPerhaps more than important than this support, though, is the sense among stakeholders that international involvement will encourage the national government in Manila to continue to prioritize the peace process. At critical junctures, Duterte, the Philippines’ first president from Mindanao, expended political capital to support the peace process; there is less hope that the Marcos government would do the same. In close coordination with Japanese, Australian, European, and U.N. partners that are already deeply committed, the United States has the potential to decisively tip the balance in the direction of peace—and at the same time make the Philippines a more stable and capable alliance partner.",
    "Advantage LCA Tejas? Philippines Grounds Korean FA-50 Fighters; Both Jets Are Competing For Malaysian & Egyptian Contracts": "Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) have been hogging the limelight as many air forces around the world turn to these efficient and maneuverable jets. Out of the LCAs currently dominating the market, the South Korean FA-50 has emerged as a clear winner.\n\nThe Ministry of National Defense of Poland recently signed two contracts to purchase 48 FA-50 light attack aircraft from South Korea. The first 12 aircraft are slated for delivery next year, while the remaining 36 will be delivered between 2025 and 2028.\n\nHowever, even as the FA-50 fighter jets are winning hearts and contracts worldwide, an existing customer has made some new and unprecedented revelations about this combat aircraft.\n\nNews reports suggested earlier this month that there is a shortage of spare parts for the Philippines Air Force to operate the squadron of FA-50 fighter jets acquired from South Korea.\n\nIn response to these reports making the rounds, the Philippine Air Force (PAF) informed last week that its non-operational FA-50PH light jet fighters were undergoing mandatory scheduled maintenance. In simpler words, they have been grounded.\n\nThis has left the PAF with a reduced fleet size as there are just three operational FA-50PH fighters in its inventory.\n\n“While it is true that we have FA-50 aircraft that are currently on non-operational status, most of them are just ongoing scheduled maintenance which is mandatory precautionary checks, and they will be back in the air soon,” said Air Force spokesperson Col. Ma Consuelo Castillo, in a message to the Philippine News Agency.\n\nEarlier, EurAsian Times reported that South Korea appeared to be ahead in the race to supply fighter jets to Malaysia, with Chinese media indicating that the country is poised to sign an export contract for 18 FA-50s for $1 billion.\n\nWhile experts have contended that the news is speculative, the aircraft has emerged as a clear challenger to India’s LCA Tejas. The bid for 18 Light Combat Aircraft for the Malaysian Air Force has been down to two contenders: the Indian LCA Tejas by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and the Korean FA-50.\n\nThe wind was in favor of Tejas, with India offering a package deal to Malaysia; the FA-50’s rise as the popular global choice has come as a shocker to the Indian authorities. It’s not yet clear which fighter jet will roar over the Malaysian skies.\n\nThe FA-50 aircraft is also being pitched to Egypt, another country where India has been looking to sell LCA Tejas. To aid that effort, the manufacturer of Tejas, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), has also offered to set up production facilities in Egypt.\n\nBesides Poland and potentially Malaysia, FA-50 fighters have been sold to the Philippines and Iraq. The rise of FA-50 light combat aircraft that has made others in the market, including Tejas, run for their money warrants a close examination of the South Korean fighter jet.\n\nSouth Korea’s FA-50 Fighter Jet\n\nThe FA-50 Fighting Eagle is a supersonic light attack aircraft developed by KAI and Lockheed Martin. It is a multirole fighter variant of the ‘T-50’ line of aircraft, which comprises supersonic trainers, light combat aircraft, and multirole fighters.\n\nThe aircraft has a 4.5-ton weapons payload capacity and could be equipped with armament including the AIM-9 Sidewinder, AGM-65 Maverick, GBU-38/B, CBU-105 Sensor Fused Weapon, Mk-82 LDGP bombs, and Cluster Bomb Units.\n\nThe fighter plane also has an internal 20mm Gatling gun with three barrels and an LAU-3/A 19-tube 2.75′′ rocket launcher that can shoot folding-fin aerial rockets (FFAR). An afterburner-equipped GE F404 turbofan engine with a 17,700 lbf output powers the FA-50.\n\nIraq signed a contract with Korean Aerospace Industries in December 2013 to deliver 24 FA-50 derivative T-50IQ aircraft over 20 years, with additional equipment and pilot training.\n\nIn 2014, South Korea signed a $420 million contract with the Philippines to sell 12 light attack FA-50 fighters. The fighter was employed for the first time against ISIS-affiliated militants during the Battle of Marawi in the Philippines that began in 2017.\n\nMore recently, the Colombian Air Force chose a mix of 20 TA-50 and FA-50 Golden Eagles as its newest jet fighters and trainers in April 2022, followed by Poland signing a contract recently.\n\nWith Egypt and Malaysia emerging as potential customers for the FA-50, India’s Tejas is set for a tough fight.\n\nLight attack fighters have hogged the limelight as their modest size results in a low radar signature. Target acquisition is challenging due to the difficulty in spotting these fighter jets by radars. This gives them a better chance of spotting the heavy aircraft and firing the first shot.\n\nBoth LCA Tejas and KAI’s FA-50 fall under the category, and both aircraft have their share of advantages over the other.\n\nSince the LCA Tejas is eyeing the South East Asia market as its primary customer, it is expected to face a severe challenge from the Korean aircraft, which is already in use with some countries, making regional integration a favorable prospect for the FA-50.\n\nIn contrast, the HAL Tejas’ open architecture computer systems can incorporate both Russian and Western armaments, providing an edge to the Indian-made light fighter in markets that buy from both markets.\n\nEarlier, the UAE had shown interest in Tejas LCA in 2018. However, in February, the UAE Defense Ministry announced it was buying L-15 training and combat aircraft from China. The UAE also reportedly expressed interest in the TA-5O aircraft produced by South Korea.",

    "How Philippine Authorities Appear to be Scheming to Bar ICC Probe of Duterte-Era ‘Death Squads’": "Perfecto Caparas, a practicing lawyer and PhD candidate at Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law discusses Rodrigo Duterte and the ICC's probe into potential crimes against humanity in the Philippines…\n\nThe new government of Ferdinand Marcos Jr and Sara Duterte is employing tricks and propaganda to entrench impunity and ward off the International Criminal Court’s long-delayed probe of crimes against humanity committed during former president Rodrigo Duterte’s reign of terror.\n\nThe latest of these ploys is the government’s attempt, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), to cripple efforts by ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan to resume his investigation into the murder of an estimated 12,000-30,000 civilians by death squads during Duterte’s so-called “war on drugs.” On September 8, the OSG opposed Khan’s request before the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber I claiming that the thousands of killings do not amount to crimes against humanity.\n\nThis is but the latest tool in the government’s toolbox of labyrinthic maneuvers to delay and defeat the ICC’s investigation and prosecution of Duterte and his top officials for one of the gravest human rights violations in Asia.\n\nOn September 15, 2021, the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber I granted the ICC Office of the Prosecutor’s (OTP) request for authorization to commence a preliminary investigation. Asking to defer the investigation, the government upended the ICC’s efforts on November 10, 2021. The OTP, thus, “temporarily suspended its investigative activities.”\n\nAuthorities know too well that the longer they bar ICC investigators from entering the country and gaining access to evidence, the greater the chances of wiping all traces of the wide scale murders. Victims not only lack the economic and political means to claim justice but face grave reprisals from the powers-that-be as well.\n\nContrary to the OSG’s claims, former president Duterte and Marcos-Duterte’s governments are both unwilling and unable to investigate and prosecute former president Duterte and the leaders of the “death squads” for the widespread and systematic slaughter of civilians.\n\n“Prisoner of conscience”\n\nThe government claims that the country’s legal and judicial processes are soundly working, repudiating then ICC chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda’s determination that crimes against humanity have been committed in violation of the Rome Statute of the ICC. However, this is belied by the prolonged and unconscionable jailing since February 24, 2017 of Senator Leila de Lima. Her only “crime” is to have the principles, integrity, and fortitude to investigate, as then chairperson of the Commission on Human Rights, and later as chairperson of the Senate Committee on Justice and Human Rights, the alleged targeted killings on orders of mayor-turned-president Duterte.\n\nPolitical dynamics\n\nDespite the fact that Duterte’s own daughter sits as vice president, human rights and democratic forces are trying to break Duterte’s impunity and fortify the rule of international human rights law.\n\nInternational criminal lawyers need to examine the political dynamics and context in which the Marcos-Duterte government is employing its latest legal move. International human rights actors need to analyze these dynamics and view them as connected to and as being part of the government’s attempts to avoid justice for crimes against humanity and other vicious forms of continuing human rights violations. This approach will enable the international community to anticipate how the ICC’s stalled investigation will fare in years to come.\n\nEven at the earliest stages of the targeted killings of civilians on a wide scale by then president Duterte, the government was already deploying deceptive and bullying tactics to cover up, deflect and smother criticism and denunciations from Bensouda and the rest of the international community. At one point, Duterte’s army of paid apologists and trolls conjured up wild claims that the slain civilians, who mostly belonged to the poorest of the poor, were allegedly killed by rival drug gangs. They even made the ludicrous claim that drug lords were funding human rights defenders who, despite great risks to themselves, were strongly condemning the cold-blooded murders. The government even falsely claimed that Rappler – whose independent and courageous journalists, including Nobel laureate Maria Ressa, have been fearlessly documenting, investigating, and reporting on the systematic murder of unarmed civilians –was backed by the CIA. They did this in order to obfuscate Duterte’s repeated public calls to kill alleged drug pushers and petty criminals, punctuated with his signature cursing, broadcast on multiple occasions nationwide.\n\nWar on human rights\n\nEventually, Duterte’s murderous frenzy spilled over to the killing of environmental and human rights defenders, including journalists and lawyers, especially after the breakdown of peace negotiations between his government and the National Democratic Front, an underground organization that includes the Communist Party of the Philippines-led New People’s Army.\n\nLawfare became a staple for government apologists, amplified by trolls, who systematically and viciously maligned, intimidated, red-tagged, and harassed independent and principled journalists, human rights and environmental lawyers and defenders, and civil society advocates. The government primarily targeted the constitutionally independent Commission on Human Rights headed by the late Chito Gascon in its smear campaign. Sycophants in congress even attempted to allocate a measly sum of one peso for CHR’s annual budget to ingratiate themselves to Duterte.\n\nMedia campaigns\n\nThe government uses social media in its witch hunt, leading to deadly consequences for those who are red-tagged. Principled and courageous human rights and environmental lawyers and defenders suffer not only from character assassination and political persecution, but also from treacherous ambushes, assassinations, trumped up charges, and unjust imprisonment. Those wrongfully imprisoned and murdered include priests, human rights defenders, lawyers, judges, farmers, workers, indigenous people, and community and trade union organizers.\n\nExpectedly, the Marcos-Duterte duo is resorting to black propaganda to undermine the ICC’s credibility and mandate to investigate and bring Duterte to trial.\n\nIn this age of fake news and government organized disinformation, people need to be vigilant and methodically act on a sustained and long-term basis to raise awareness about the true nature of the the ICC’s mandate.\n\nWitch hunt\n\nOverall, the police forces and military appear to have remained stuck for decades in a cold war ideology and the national security doctrine, ignoring quantum leaps in the development of international human rights law, international humanitarian law, international criminal law, and international environmental law. The police and military mindset seems to rigidly harbor the myopic view that the peaceful exercise of the democratic right to dissent on the part of the people, particularly journalists and political activists, means they are so-called “communists” or “terrorists.” By and large, police and military imply through red-baiting that being vigilant in safeguarding democratic, human and environmental rights makes one a true blue “communist terrorist.”\n\nThe series of killings of red-tagged personalities and alleged communist leaders seems reminiscent of what happened in the aftermath of the 1965 coup wherein the military summarily killed 80,000-1 million alleged members and sympathizers of the Communist Party of Indonesia (Partai Komunis Indonesia, PKI).\n\nConjuring up the “communist” and “terrorist” bogeyman, the government came up with the Anti-Terror Act. Citing the Maoist-oriented New People’s Army insurgents, the government has been shooting from the hip, indiscriminately red-tagging and arresting and jailing unarmed civilians on trumped-up charges. The Anti-Money Laundering Council has been using this law to freeze, without due process of law, the financial accounts of individuals and nongovernmental organizations engaged in grassroots developmental work. To be red-tagged is tantamount to being issued a death warrant by armed state actors, notably the police, military, and their “force multipliers.”\n\nDestroying the rule of law\n\nNothing illustrates this cold war archetype more than the ₱17 billion budget allocated for 2022 by congress to the National Task Force to End the Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC). Defenders of environmental and human rights and democracy, including lawyers and journalists, find themselves at the receiving end of the NTF-ELCAC’s red-tagging assaults, with police and military backing up its nefarious witch hunts. This is a violation of the police and military’s legal obligation to respect, protect, promote, and fulfill the constitutionally guaranteed human rights of these civilians, especially to exercise their right to free speech, press, expression, association, and assembly.\n\nThe government’s red-tagging activities, coupled with multiple assassinations, seem calculated to silence exposés of official corruption and abuse of power. These witch hunters undermine and destroy the country’s democratic institutions and, ultimately, the rule of law.\n\nMilitary and police institutions are among the elements fighting against the ICC’s push to investigate the 12,000-30,000 civilian deaths at the hands of the police, their “force multipliers,” and so-called “vigilantes” believed to be undercover state agents themselves. Aside from police and military institutions, members of Duterte’s own political dynasty, proteges in congress, courts, and executive departments and offices, like the OSG and the Department of Justice, are attempting to thwart the ICC’s attempts to gather evidence of crimes against humanity penalized under the Rome Statute.\n\nDemocratic voices\n\nThankfully, there are factors that can overcome the hurdles that the government puts up to quell attempts to seek accountability for the worst ever crimes committed against civilians in the country’s post-World War II history. These crimes surpass the dark human rights record of Marcos’ own father, the late pillager and despot Ferdinand Marcos Sr during martial law. These crimes are equaled by, if they do not surpass, the atrocities committed by the Spanish guardia civil, by American occupation forces, and by Japanese invaders. These factors include:\n\nthe internationally backed creation, mandate, and operation of the ICC with its track record of strict adherence to the Rome Statute of the ICC, judicial precedents, and its core legal documents\n\nthe existence of victims of crimes against humanity in the country who courageously participated in the ICC pre-trial proceedings despite risks of reprisal from authorities and the abject lack of domestic institutional mechanisms to safeguard, conceal, and protect their identity, location and wellbeing\n\nof crimes against humanity in the country who courageously in the ICC pre-trial proceedings despite risks of reprisal from authorities and the abject lack of domestic institutional mechanisms to safeguard, conceal, and protect their identity, location and wellbeing the existence of principled, independent, courageous and committed lawyers, human rights and environmental defenders, church, and civil society advocates with high level ground and operational expertise, international networks, and capacity for timely documentation and dissemination of human rights alerts\n\nthe existence of independent, principled, courageous and committed investigative journalists, steeped in the adversarial tradition of journalism, such as those belonging to the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines , Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism , and Vera Files , with international presence and networks\n\n, , and , with international presence and networks the existence of the Commission on Human Rights with a proven track record of adherence to the Paris Principles and fundamental tenets of international human rights law, and more specifically, the rights-based approach, with gender, child, ethnic and persons with disability perspectives\n\nwith a proven track record of adherence to the and fundamental tenets of international human rights law, and more specifically, the rights-based approach, with gender, child, ethnic and persons with disability perspectives the existence, though they are in the minority, of progressive state actors in various branches and levels of government, particularly the courts and congress\n\nthe existence of domestic and international human rights organizations, like Amnesty International which has historically documented cases of human rights violations in the Philippines particularly during Marcos’ martial law era\n\nAlthough under siege, and despite high risks to their own life and freedom, these human rights actors unrelentingly engage in various forms of human rights defense, including documentation and evidence-gathering, litigation, advocacy, networking, community organizing, human rights and paralegal training, grassroots capacity-building, and human rights culture-building. It is worth mentioning that, broadly, the human rights community includes torture survivors and freedom fighters from Marcos’ martial law era. They embody and represent the continuum of the human rights community and media’s glorious history and tradition – consecrated in tears and blood – of preserving and fighting for the people’s cherished democratic rights and freedoms.\n\nThe UN Human Rights Council and its special procedures, UN human rights treaty bodies, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and various regional and state actors also play critical roles in exacting accountability for these crimes against humanity. In addition, should they choose to commit to the advancement of their human rights obligations, private corporations – particularly those steeped in environmental and social governance principles and practices – may eventually emerge as another major player.\n\nAnother significant factor is the interconnectedness and real-time communication of our world today.\n\nCritical mass\n\nAll these factors enable human rights actors to cast a spotlight on the government’s lame attempts to hide the impunity with which armed state actors and their so-called “force multipliers” perpetrate their abhorrent “core crimes” under international law. All this helps expose the vicious lies of the government’s propaganda machine, which continued even at the height of the covid-19 pandemic.\n\nHopefully, these human rights forces can help fulfill and realize the ICC’s raison d’être, despite the Marcos-Duterte regime’s persistent attempts to frustrate the ICC mandate to dismantle the wall of impunity. Human rights forces will not capitulate to the government’s legal maneuvers and terror tactics, even as the government has veered toward authoritarianism.\n\nThe convergence of these state, civil society, and international actors inevitably forms a powerful critical mass, provided they mutually, resolutely, and constantly support each other, in a symbiotic way, especially in the face of assaults by enemies of democracy, human rights, and sustainable development.\n\nWe are witnessing in this country, and other parts of the world, the struggle between authoritarian, despotic, and fascist blocs, on the one hand, and democratic, environmental, and human rights forces, on the other.\n\nWith highly perceptive and seasoned ICC prosecutors and judges – particularly ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan – the government’s subterfuge and legal maneuvers will not prevail.\n\nA licensed attorney, Perfecto Caparas serves as a teaching fellow and founding director of the Center for Holistic International Human Rights Law Praxis of the National University of the Union of Myanmar-Burmese American Community Institute.
