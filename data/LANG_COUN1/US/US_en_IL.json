    "Israel: Background And US Relations In Brief – Analysis": "By CRS\n\nBy Jim Zanotti*\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIsrael has forged close bilateral cooperation with the United States in many areas. A 10-year bilateral military aid memorandum of understanding—signed in 2016—commits the United States to provide Israel $3.3 billion in Foreign Military Financing and to spend $500 million annually on joint missile defense programs from FY2019 to FY2028, subject to congressional appropriations. Some Members of Congress have increased their scrutiny over Israel’s use of U.S. security assistance, contributing to debate on the subject. This report also discusses the following matters:\n\nPolitical instability and fall 2022 election. Israel has experienced a period of unprecedented political instability since April 2019. During this time, the country has held four elections with then-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu facing criminal prosecution on political corruption charges. After the coalition government that replaced Netanyahu in June 2021 broke down in June 2022, another election—the fifth round in four years—is scheduled to take place on November 1, 2022. With the collapse of the coalition, Israel’s prime minister changed from Naftali Bennett (who had held the office since June 2021) to Yair Lapid. Lapid, of the Yesh Atid party, is to serve in a caretaker capacity along with Israel’s other cabinet ministers until a new Knesset installs a new government. The elections and the subsequent government formation process are likely to feature competition between Netanyahu’s Likud party and the parties inclined to support him, and Prime Minister Lapid and others who oppose Netanyahu leading another government.\n\nIsraeli-Palestinian issues. In hopes of preserving the viability of a negotiated two-state solution among Israelis and Palestinians, Biden Administration officials have sought to help manage tensions, bolster Israel’s defensive capabilities, and strengthen U.S.-Palestinian ties that frayed during the Trump Administration. Administration officials regularly speak out against steps taken by Israelis or Palestinians that could risk sparking violence and undermining the vision of two states— including settlement expansion and settler violence, demolitions, evictions, incitement to violence, and payments for individuals imprisoned for acts of terrorism. Violence in 2022 amid ongoing disputes over Jerusalem and increased West Bank militancy has triggered heightened counterterrorism measures and some controversy, including in relation to the killing of Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh. With the Gaza Strip still under the control of the Sunni Islamist militant group Hamas (a U.S.-designated terrorist organization), the United States and other international actors face significant challenges in seeking to help with reconstruction without bolstering the group.\n\nThe Abraham Accords and Israeli normalization with Muslim-majority states. The Biden Administration has followed agreements reached during the Trump Administration that normalized or improved relations between Israel and four Arab or Muslim-majority states—the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco. Biden Administration officials have said that any further U.S. efforts to assist Israeli normalization with Muslim-majority countries would seek to preserve the viability of a negotiated two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Palestinian leaders have denounced normalization as an abandonment of the Palestinian national cause, given Arab states’ previous insistence that Israel address Palestinian negotiating demands as a precondition for improved ties.\n\nOngoing efforts to deepen security and economic ties between Israel, the UAE, Bahrain, and Morocco could drive broader regional cooperation—including on air and missile defense—that inclines Saudi Arabia and other Muslim-majority countries toward future normalization with Israel. Congress has passed and proposed legislation encouraging more normalization and greater regional security cooperation involving Israel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCountering Iran in the region. Israeli officials seek to counter Iranian regional influence and prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Israel supported President Trump’s withdrawal of the United States from the 2015 international agreement that constrained Iran’s nuclear activities. Israel’s leaders reportedly have varying views about a possible U.S. return to the agreement. Observers have speculated about future Israeli covert or military actions to influence nuclear diplomacy and Iran’s program. Israel also has reportedly conducted a number of military operations against Iran and its allies in Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq due to its concerns about Iran’s presence in these areas and Lebanese Hezbollah’s missile arsenal.\n\nRussia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. In the wake of Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Israel has sought to provide political support for Ukraine and humanitarian relief for Ukrainians without alienating Russia. To date, Israel has not directly provided lethal assistance to Ukraine, but has provided protective equipment to Ukrainian rescue forces and civilian groups. Since 2015, Russia’s defense capabilities in Syria have compelled Israel to deconflict its airstrikes there with Russia. Russia has started action to close the Russian branch of the Jewish Agency for Israel, a move that could strain bilateral ties.\n\nOverview: Major Issues for U.S.-Israel Relations\n\nIsrael (see Figure 1 for a map and basic facts) has forged close bilateral cooperation with the United States in many areas. For more background, see CRS Report RL33476, Israel: Background and U.S. Relations, by Jim Zanotti; and CRS Report RL33222, U.S. Foreign Aid to Israel, by Jeremy M. Sharp.\n\nU.S.-Israel security cooperation—a critical part of the bilateral relationship—is multifaceted. U.S. law requires the executive branch to take certain actions to preserve Israel’s “qualitative military edge,” or QME, and expedites aid and arms sales to Israel in various ways. A 10-year bilateral military aid memorandum of understanding (MOU)—signed in 2016—commits the United States to provide Israel $3.3 billion in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) and to spend $500 million annually on joint missile defense programs from FY2019 to FY2028, subject to congressional appropriations. The MOU anticipates possible supplemental aid in emergency situations such as conflict. In March 2022, Congress appropriated $1 billion in supplemental funding through FY2024 for the Iron Dome anti-rocket system as a response to the system’s heavy use during a May 2021 conflict between Israel and Gaza Strip-based groups such as Hamas and Palestine Islamic Jihad (PIJ) (both of which are U.S.-designated terrorist organizations). A few lawmakers seek oversight measures and legislation to distinguish certain Israeli actions in the West Bank and Gaza from general U.S. support for Israeli security.1\n\nThe Trump Administration made U.S. policy changes affecting bilateral relations when it recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital in 2017 and moved the location of the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in 2018. These actions could affect future outcomes regarding Jerusalem’s status—given Palestinian claims to East Jerusalem as their future national capital— though the Trump Administration did not take a position on the boundaries of Israeli sovereignty in the city. The Biden Administration has said that the embassy will remain in Jerusalem.2\n\nAdditional issues to be discussed below with significant implications for U.S.-Israel relations include\n\nIsrael’s ongoing political instability and the upcoming fall 2022 election.\n\nIsraeli-Palestinian problems and their implications for U.S. policy, including violence and controversy in 2022, Gaza and its challenges, and human rights considerations.\n\nDevelopments regarding Israel’s normalization or improvement of relations with various Arab and Muslim-majority states since the Abraham Accords.\n\nConcerns about Iran’s nuclear program and regional influence, including with Lebanon-based Hezbollah.\n\nRussia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nSources: Graphic created by CRS.

(2) The status of the Gaza Strip is a final status issue to be resolved through negotiations. (3) The United States recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital in 2017 without taking a position on the specific boundaries of Israeli sovereignty. (4) Boundary representation is not necessarily authoritative. Additionally, the United States recognized the Golan Heights as part of Israel in 2019; however, U.N. Security Council Resolution 497, adopted on December 17, 1981, held that the area of the Golan Heights controlled by Israel’s military is occupied territory belonging to Syria.

During this time, the country has held four elections with then-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu facing criminal prosecution on political corruption charges. After the coalition government that replaced Netanyahu in June 2021 broke down in June 2022 (as discussed below), another election—the fifth round in four years—is scheduled to take place on November 1, 2022. With the collapse of the coalition, Israel’s prime minister changed from Naftali Bennett of the now-defunct Yamina party (who had held the office since June 2021) to Yair Lapid of the Yesh Atid party. Lapid is to serve in a caretaker capacity along with Israel’s other cabinet ministers (see Table 1) until a new Knesset installs a new government. Bennett, as alternate prime minister, is to maintain significant responsibility for Iran-related issues, but he has announced that he will not run in the fall election.\n\nOver nearly four years, Israel’s efforts at establishing political leadership have unfolded as follows. Netanyahu was selected by Israel’s president as the Knesset member best situated to form a government after both the April 2019 and September 2019 elections, but was unable to do so in either case—the first time such a stalemate had occurred in Israel. After the March 2020 election, Netanyahu formed a power-sharing government in May 2020 with Benny Gantz’s Kahol Lavan party (now part of the National Unity party), but the government collapsed later that year over a failure to pass a national budget.\n\nThe resulting election in March 2021 led to the replacement of Netanyahu’s government by a wide-ranging but fractious coalition of parties in June 2021. While Bennett—a right-of-center figure—served as prime minister of this power-sharing government, the centrist Lapid played a leading role in arranging the coalition.\n\nIn June 2022, the Netanyahu-led opposition in the Knesset withheld its support for a bill to renew the application of certain aspects of civilian law to Israeli settlers in the West Bank, and the bill failed to pass after two members of Bennett’s Yamina party left the coalition in hopes of bringing a more right-leaning government to power. To trigger an automatic renewal of the civilian laws’ application to West Bank settlers, Bennett and Lapid got the Knesset to dissolve the coalition and vote for the election now scheduled for the fall. Under the government’s power-sharing agreement, once the Knesset voted for a new election, Lapid (see text box below for a brief biography) became Israel’s caretaker prime minister because members of Bennett’s party were responsible for the coalition’s demise.\n\nThe elections and the subsequent government formation process are likely to feature competition between Netanyahu’s Likud party and the parties inclined to support him, and Prime Minister Lapid’s Yesh Atid party and others across the political spectrum who oppose Netanyahu leading another government. The previous coalition achieved little consensus on controversial subjects—the Palestinians, how to balance judicial review and majority rule, and religion’s role in the state. Nevertheless, Lapid and Bennett maintain that this coalition competently addressed important issues such as Iran, the budget, and the COVID-19 crisis.6\n\nNetanyahu’s trial is ongoing and may continue for years without legally preventing him from leading a government. Some observers speculate that he might be open to political compromises with other parties in return for measures to end or disrupt his prosecution, even though Netanyahu denies this.7 Such compromises could include efforts to increase formal Israeli control over parts of the West Bank and reduce the judiciary’s power over legislation or government action.\n\nItamar Ben Gvir and his Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) party are possible Likud coalition partners—as part of a broader Religious Zionism electoral list—and have links with a Jewish ultra-nationalist movement based on the ideology of Meir Kahane (1932-1990).8 Kahane served in the Knesset from 1984 until 1988, when his party was banned from elections after Israel passed legislation disqualifying those who incite racism. The U.S. government has designated a Kahanist group (Kahane Chai) as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist entity, even though the government de-listed the group as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 2022 due to its inactivity.9\n\nThe following could be significant factors regarding the elections and government formation process:\n\nAnother stalemate? Initial polling suggests that Likud will probably win more votes than any other party. Pro- and anti-Netanyahu blocs may both have difficulty achieving Knesset support to form a government,10 with the pro- Netanyahu bloc appearing more likely to obtain it.11 In such an event, Lapid and other caretaker officials might continue in their positions through multiple election rounds, as Netanyahu did when serving in a caretaker capacity from December 2018 until May 2020.\n\nInitial polling suggests that Likud will probably win more votes than any other party.

Potential game changers. The electoral math could change in the wake of some parties combining or breaking apart, and if some parties near the electoral threshold fall beneath it. In July 2022, Kahol Lavan and New Hope agreed to merge for November’s election as the National Unity party, and former Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Gadi Eizenkot has since joined the party. These developments may boost Defense Minister Gantz’s prime ministerial chances. Leaders of the National Unity and Yisrael Beitenu parties currently oppose sitting in government with Netanyahu, but also have a history of working with him.\n\nThe electoral math could change in the wake of some parties combining or breaking apart, and if some parties near the electoral threshold fall beneath it.

As in the previous government, Arab-led parties could be decisive in determining future political outcomes. The Islamist United Arab List (UAL or Ra’am) was the first independent Arab party to join an Israeli government when it joined the Lapid-Bennett coalition in June 2021.12 The Joint List (made up of three smaller parties with socialist or nationalist leanings) stayed aloof from pro- and anti-Netanyahu blocs in the past coalition. One of the parties that was part of the Joint List, an Arab nationalist party known as Balad, plans to run in the November election separately from the other two (Hadash and Ta’al) and may not clear the threshold—possibly boosting the chances for a pro- Netanyahu Knesset majority. Voter turnout among Arab citizens of Israel has fluctuated between 45% and 65% in the past four elections.13 It could affect the Arab parties’ prospects of reaching the electoral threshold, and thus their ability to influence government formation or critical legislation.14\n\nIsraeli-Palestinian Issues15\n\nOverview\n\nBiden Administration officials have said that they seek to preserve the viability of a negotiated two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, while playing down near-term prospects for direct Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.16 In doing so, they seek to help manage tensions, bolster Israel’s defensive capabilities, and strengthen U.S.-Palestinian ties that frayed during the Trump Administration. These officials regularly speak out against steps taken by Israelis or Palestinians that could risk sparking violence and undermining the vision of two states—including settlement expansion and settler violence, demolitions, evictions, incitement to violence, and payments for individuals imprisoned for acts of terrorism.17\n\nSome Israeli settlement construction plans for East Jerusalem and the West Bank have advanced,18 but Israel has reportedly delayed a few plans flagged as especially damaging to the two-state vision by the Biden Administration or some Members of Congress.19 In May 2022, Israel advanced plans for nearly 4,500 additional housing units for West Bank settlements,20 drawing statements of strong opposition from the Administration.21\n\nBiden Administration officials have renewed diplomatic ties with West Bank-based Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas and resumed various forms of U.S. aid for Palestinians.27 Additionally, as part of FY2021 appropriations legislation, the Nita M. Lowey Middle East Partnership for Peace Act of 2020 (MEPPA, Title VIII of P.L. 116-260) authorized the establishment of two funds to support development in the West Bank and Gaza, along with various types of Israeli-Palestinian dialogue and cooperation.28 For allocation between the two MEPPA funds, Congress appropriated $50 million for FY2021 and the same amount for FY2022, with additional $50 million tranches authorized for FY2023, FY2024, and FY2025.\n\nIsrael has taken some steps to improve Palestinians’ economic and living circumstances, including through loans and work permits.29 However, some critics charge that the measures mirror past Israeli efforts to manage the conflict’s effects unilaterally rather than address its causes through negotiation with Palestinians.30 During President Biden’s July 2022 visit to Israel and the West Bank, the White House released a statement saying that Israel had committed to expanding the number of Palestinian work permits, 24-hour accessibility to the Allenby border crossing between the West Bank and Jordan, and efforts to upgrade the West Bank and Gaza to 4G communications infrastructure.31\n\nSome international bodies have subjected alleged Israeli human rights violations against Palestinians to further legal and political scrutiny. In March 2021, the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor began an investigation into possible crimes in the West Bank and Gaza.32 Members of Congress have taken varying positions on human rights-related concerns.\n\nViolence and Controversy in 2022 and Shireen Abu Akleh Killing\n\nA number of complicated factors may contribute to heightened tensions and episodic violence between Israelis and Palestinians in the West Bank, Jerusalem, and Israel. With prospects dim for diplomatic resolution of final-status issues like borders, refugees, and Jerusalem’s status, militants and activists on both sides may seek to shape outcomes or express protest. Arab states’ greater willingness—despite Israeli-Palestinian diplomatic stalemate—to cooperate openly with Israel could feed increased tensions (see “The Abraham Accords” below).\n\nTo date in 2022, Israeli-Palestinian violence has resulted in the deaths of at least 19 Israelis or foreigners in Israel and more than 85 Palestinians in the West Bank,33 amid the following:\n\nProtests and violent altercations around Jerusalem holy sites, including during religious holidays and other sensitive times commemorating historical events.34\n\nHeightened Israeli and PA security measures to counter alleged Palestinian lawlessness and militancy in West Bank cities such as Jenin and Nablus.35In light of widespread domestic disaffection with 87-year-old PA President Abbas and apparent early jockeying for influence in anticipation of the end of his rule, some younger West Bank\n\nIn light of widespread domestic disaffection with 87-year-old PA President Abbas and apparent early jockeying for influence in anticipation of the end of his rule, some younger West Bank militants who are linked to Abbas’s secular faction Fatah may be working across factional lines with Islamists from Hamas and PIJ.36\n\nIn May 2022, prominent Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh (a Palestinian Christian from East Jerusalem who was a U.S. citizen) was killed by a gunshot in an area of Jenin where Israeli security forces were trading fire with Palestinians. Her death triggered a major international outcry, as did images of Israeli police disrupting her funeral in East Jerusalem. In condemning Abu Akleh’s killing and an injury suffered by one of her colleagues, the State Department spokesperson called for an immediate and thorough investigation and full accountability, and said that Israel has “the wherewithal and the capabilities to conduct a thorough, comprehensive investigation.”37 Some evidence suggests that the shot may have come from Israeli forces,38 with the PA claiming that its investigation proves Israeli forces deliberately targeted Abu Akleh, but Israel denying any such intent.39 In April 2022, some advocacy groups and lawyers had filed a complaint with the ICC alleging that Israel has systematically targeted Palestinian journalists for years.40\n\nAfter some Members of the House and Senate sent letters to the executive branch requesting that the State Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation conduct an independent investigation into Abu Akleh’s death,41 the State Department issued a statement in July. The statement said that the U.S. Security Coordinator (USSC) for Israel and the Palestinian Authority oversaw an independent process, and in summarizing Israeli and PA investigations concluded that Israeli gunfire likely killed Abu Akleh, but “found no reason to believe that this was intentional.”42 PA officials and members of Abu Akleh’s family have publicly criticized the part of the USSC’s finding regarding intent.43\n\nAfter conducting an internal investigation, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in September that there was a “high possibility” that Abu Akleh was accidentally hit by IDF gunfire44—eliciting additional public criticism from PA officials and Abu Akleh family members who assert that the shooting was not accidental.45 In response, the State Department welcomed the IDF review, later adding that U.S. officials would continue to press Israel to “closely review its policies and practices on rules of engagement and consider additional steps to mitigate the risk of civilian harm, protect journalists and prevent similar tragedies in the future.”46 Prime Minister Lapid and Defense Minister Gantz then defended Israel’s rules of engagement and said that no outside party could dictate them.47\n\nThe Abraham Accords\n\nIn late 2020 and early 2021, Israel reached agreements to normalize or improve its relations with four members of the Arab League: the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan. The Trump Administration facilitated each of these agreements, known as the Abraham Accords, and (as mentioned above) provided U.S. security, diplomatic, or economic incentives for most of the countries in question.58 In 2021, Israel opened embassies in the UAE and Bahrain, and both countries reciprocated. Israel and Morocco also reopened the liaison offices that each country had operated in the other from the mid-1990s to 2000. Saudi Arabia reportedly supported the UAE and Bahrain in their decisions to join the Abraham Accords, even allowing the use of Saudi airspace for direct commercial airline flights between those countries and Israel.59\n\nTrade, tourism, and investment ties have generally deepened since the signing of the Accords— including a May 2022 Israel-UAE free-trade agreement (pending Israeli ratification) and a major Israel-UAE-Jordan initiative focused on desalinated water and solar energy.60 One exception is that implementing Israel-Sudan normalization appears to be on hold following the Sudanese military’s seizure of power in October 2021.61 As a sign of mutual high-level commitment to the Accords, Secretary of State Antony Blinken met Israeli Foreign Minister Lapid and the foreign ministers of the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, and Egypt at a March 2022 summit in Israel’s southern Negev desert.\n\nU.S. and Israeli officials seek to expand the Abraham Accords to include other Arab and Muslim- majority countries. Commemorating the one-year anniversary of the Israel-UAE-Bahrain agreements in October 2021, Secretary Blinken said that “we’re committed to continue building on the efforts of the last administration to expand the circle of countries with normalized relations with Israel in the years ahead.”62 However, the Biden Administration appetite for offering major U.S. policy inducements to countries in connection with normalization efforts remains unclear.63 The Biden Administration also has sought to avoid portraying Israeli normalization with Arab and Muslim-majority states as a substitute for efforts toward a negotiated two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.64 Palestinian leaders denounced the initial announcement of UAE normalization with Israel as an abandonment of the Palestinian national cause, given Arab League states’ previous insistence that Israel address Palestinian negotiating demands as a precondition for improved ties.65\n\nProspects for Saudi normalization. As Israel has drawn closer to some Arab states, the likelihood of a future normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia may increase. Given Saudi Arabia’s importance as an economic and military power in the region, the kingdom’s history of firm opposition to such normalization, and its status as the custodian of Islam’s most holy and foundational sites, such a development could boost any precedent that the Abraham Accords may set for other Muslim-majority countries considering cooperation with Israel.66 In June 2022, Secretary Blinken said that Saudi Arabia is a “critical partner” of the United States in dealing with regional challenges from extremism and Iran and expressed his “hope” that the kingdom would be a partner in “continuing the process of building relationships between Israel and its neighbors both near and further away through the continuation, the expansion of the Abraham Accords.”67\n\nWhile senior Saudi officials say that full Israel-Saudi normalization still remains contingent on progress with Palestinian issues—including the establishment of a Palestinian state68—Israel and Saudi Arabia are reportedly engaging in serious talks in the meantime to build business ties and coordinate on regional security matters. While Saudi leaders continue discreetly coordinating with Israel on regional defense, they apparently prefer to hedge by keeping diplomatic options open with Iran rather than formalizing an anti-Iran coalition.69\n\nDuring President Biden’s trip to the region in July 2022, he announced certain steps that could point toward eventual normalization. These included the opening of Saudi airspace to Israeli civilian overflights, and an arrangement that is to allow Saudi Arabia to take full control of the Red Sea islands Tiran and Sanafir from Egypt while guaranteeing Israel’s freedom of navigation, despite the planned withdrawal of a Multinational Force and Observers peacekeeping contingent that includes U.S. troops.70\n\nSecurity cooperation. In January 2021, President Trump determined that U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), which commands U.S. military forces in most countries in the Middle East, would add Israel to its area of responsibility, partly to encourage military interoperability as a means of reinforcing closer ties between Israel and many Arab states.71 Israel had previously been under the purview of U.S. European Command. CENTCOM formalized Israel’s move in September 2021,72 and in October an Israeli Defense Forces liaison was stationed at CENTCOM headquarters.73 Since then, Israel has joined military exercises with the United States and the other Abraham Accords states, as well as other CENTCOM partners such as Saudi Arabia, Oman, Jordan, Egypt, and Pakistan.74\n\nFollowing a string of missile and drone attacks against the UAE in early 2022, apparently by Iran-allied forces in Yemen (known as the Houthis), the UAE government has reportedly expressed interest in closer security cooperation with Israel.75 Earlier, both Morocco (November 2021) and Bahrain (February 2022) signed MOUs with Israel on security cooperation.76 These MOUs appear to anticipate more intelligence sharing, joint exercises and training, and arms sales. In his February 8, 2022, confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, soon-to-be CENTCOM Commander and General Michael Kurilla testified that Israel and other regional countries were cooperating on integrated air and missile defense and in other security areas. At the March 2022 Negev summit, Israeli leaders and their Arab counterparts reportedly discussed a range of possible cooperative measures, such as real-time intelligence sharing on inbound drone and missile threats and acquisition of Israeli air defense systems.77 Speculation about specific measures has continued since then,78 and Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz said in June 2022 that a “Middle East Air Defense Alliance” is already working together with the United States.79\n\nReports suggest that while some air defense coordination may be taking place between Israel, certain Arab states, and the United States, “Arab participants are reluctant to confirm their involvement, let alone advertise their participation in a fully fledged military alliance.”80 One obstacle could be the apparent reluctance of regional countries to share the real-time intelligence data that underlies basic threat information they might be more willing to share.81 Unless and until a regional framework is formalized, CENTCOM apparently plans to help coordinate air defense and response with various U.S. regional partners using the X-band radar stationed in Israel, ship-borne Aegis combat systems, and existing air defense systems and fighter jets.82\n\nIsrael appears to welcome the increased operational capabilities, geographical depth, and political cover that coordination with Arab Gulf states can provide in countering Iran. While some Gulf States may welcome closer coordination with Israel, others, including the UAE, also maintain ties to Iran and might want to preserve these by avoiding any direct deployment of Israeli forces on their territory. Over the past year, the UAE has pursued a policy of limited engagement with Iran. In summer 2022, the UAE announced that it would return its ambassador to Tehran after a six- year hiatus.\n\nSelected congressional actions. In January 2022, some Members of the Senate and House formed bipartisan caucuses to promote the Abraham Accords.83 In March, Congress enacted the Israel Relations Normalization Act of 2022 (IRNA, Division Z of P.L. 117-103). Among other things, the IRNA requires the Secretary of State to submit an annual strategy for strengthening and expanding normalization agreements with Israel, and an annual report on the status of measures within Arab League states that legally or practically restrict or discourage normalization efforts with Israel or domestic support for such efforts.\n\nIn June 2022, several Members in the Senate and House introduced the Deterring Enemy Forces and Enabling National Defenses (DEFEND) Act of 2022 (S. 4366 and H.R. 7987). The bill has provisions that would require the Secretary of Defense to submit a strategy and feasibility study on cooperation with Gulf Cooperation Council states, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, and Egypt for an integrated air and missile defense capability to counter Iran-related threats. Large portions of the bill have been incorporated as amendments to the House Armed Services Committee version (H.R. 7900) and Senate Armed Services Committee version (S. 4543) of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2023.\n\nCountering Iran\n\nIsraeli officials cite Iran as one of their primary concerns, largely because of (1) antipathy toward Israel expressed by Iran’s revolutionary regime, (2) Iran’s broad regional influence (including in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen), and (3) Iran’s nuclear and missile programs and advanced conventional weapons capabilities. Iran-backed groups’ demonstrated abilities since 2019 to penetrate the air defenses of countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates through coordinated drone and missile attacks have implications for Israeli security calculations.84 Israeli observers who anticipate the possibility of a future war similar or greater in magnitude to Israel’s 2006 war against Lebanese Hezbollah refer to the small-scale military skirmishes or covert actions since then involving Israel, Iran, or their allies as “the campaign between the wars.”85\n\nIranian Nuclear Issue and Regional Tensions\n\nIsrael has sought to influence U.S. decisions on the international agreement on Iran’s nuclear program (known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA). Then-Prime Minister Netanyahu strenuously opposed the JCPOA in 2015 when it was negotiated by the Obama Administration, and welcomed President Trump’s May 2018 withdrawal of the United States from the JCPOA and accompanying reimposition of U.S. sanctions on Iran’s core economic sectors. Since this time, Iran has increased its enrichment of uranium to levels that could significantly shorten the time it requires to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons.86 Reported low-level Israel-Iran conflict has persisted in various settings—including cyberspace, international waters, and the territory of Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq—with implications for regional tensions.87 In June 2022, then-Prime Minister Bennett characterized some operations inside Iran in the past year as targeting the “head of the octopus” to counter a range of Iranian military capabilities.88\n\nAs the Biden Administration engages in international diplomacy and considers the possibility of reentering or revising the JCPOA, Israel is reportedly still seeking to influence diplomatic outcomes. Prior to the November 2021 resumption of international negotiations with Iran, then- Prime Minister Bennett stated that Israel would not be bound by a return to the JCPOA.89 A January 2022 report suggested that some leading Israeli security officials might prefer an international deal to no deal because an agreement could provide “increased certainty about the limitations on Iran’s nuclear program, and it would buy more time for Israel to prepare for escalation scenarios.”90 During his time as prime minister, Bennett opposed the deal,91 but largely abstained from involvement in U.S. debates on the issue.92 Prime Minister Yair Lapid replaced Bennett in July 2022 and has maintained a consistent stance on the issue.93\n\nAs international discussions around the JCPOA continued in March 2022, Bennett and then- Foreign Minister Lapid issued a joint statement arguing against reports that the United States might remove Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) from its Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTO) list in exchange for a promise not to harm Americans.94 In an April 26, 2022, Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Secretary Blinken said that he could only envision the IRGC’s de-listing if Iran takes steps necessary to justify it.95 On May 4, 62 Senators voted in favor of a motion that any Iran nuclear deal must address Iran’s ballistic missile program, support for terrorism, and oil trade with China, and not lift sanctions on or de-list the IRGC.96 During his July 2022 trip to Israel, President Biden confirmed that he would not remove the IRGC from the FTO list.97\n\nDuring President Biden’s trip to Israel in July, he and Prime Minister Lapid signed the Jerusalem U.S.-Israel Strategic Partnership Joint Declaration, which included a U.S. commitment “never to allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon,” and a statement that the United States “is prepared to use all elements of its national power to ensure that outcome.”98 Reportedly, Lapid said to Biden that talks regarding the JCPOA must have a deadline. Biden has not specified a deadline and said that diplomacy was his preferred method to resolve the issue, but also said that “we’re not going to wait forever.”99 Additionally, Biden said that he would be willing to use force against Iran as a “last resort” to prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons.100 Lapid said that Israel wants a credible military threat to be the basis for international negotiations with Iran on the nuclear issue, and that the United States “didn’t necessarily agree on this” during President Biden’s visit.101\n\nOne source reported in May 2022 that divisions persist among Israeli officials over which approach or combination of approaches—among options including international diplomacy, U.S.- led sanctions, and Israeli military and intelligence operations—may be likelier to prevent or slow Iranian nuclear advances.102 Under Lapid, Israeli officials have continued to publicly criticize a renewed or revised international nuclear deal, but appear less likely than previously under Netanyahu to actively encourage congressional opposition to U.S. executive branch decisions.103\n\nVarious sources document reported Israeli covert or military operations targeting Iran’s nuclear program,104 and some U.S. officials have reportedly differed with Israeli counterparts on the overall effectiveness of such operations.105 Even with reported upgrades to Israeli military capabilities,106 questions apparently remain about military readiness for a major operation against Iran’s nuclear program.107\n\nHezbollah and Syria\n\nLebanese Hezbollah is Iran’s closest and most powerful nonstate ally in the region. Hezbollah’s forces and Israel’s military have sporadically clashed near the Lebanese border for decades—with the antagonism at times contained in the border area, and at times escalating into broader conflict.108 Speculation persists about the potential for wider conflict and its implications, including from incursions into Israeli airspace by Hezbollah drones.109\n\nIsraeli officials have sought to draw attention to Hezbollah’s buildup of mostly Iran-supplied weapons—including reported upgrades to the range, precision, and power of its projectiles—and its alleged use of Lebanese civilian areas as strongholds.110 In early 2022, Hezbollah’s leadership and Israel’s defense ministry both publicly cited Iran-backed efforts by Hezbollah to manufacture precision-guided missiles in Lebanon.111\n\nGiven Syria’s greater reliance on Iran due to its long civil war, Iran has sought to bolster Hezbollah by sending advanced weapons to Lebanon through Syria or by establishing other military sites on Syrian territory. In response, Israel has conducted thousands of airstrikes on Iran- backed targets that could present threats to its security.112\n\nRussia has reportedly shown some capacity to thwart Israeli airstrikes against Iranian or Syrian targets,113 but has generally refrained via a deconfliction mechanism with Israel.114 This deconfliction has apparently continued to date even with Russia’s war on Ukraine, but Russia has criticized some Israeli strikes.115 In May 2022, a Russian-origin S-300 air defense system in Syria reportedly fired on Israeli jets for the first time, raising questions about the status of Israel-Russia deconfliction.116 In August, a private Israeli company published images indicating that Russia has since taken the S-300 back to Russia as part of its Ukraine-related military efforts.117\n\nIn June and July 2022, Israel’s military intercepted Hezbollah drones heading either for the Israel- Lebanon border or Israeli infrastructure at the Karish offshore gas field that is the subject of an Israel-Lebanon maritime boundary dispute. In July, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah threatened additional action and said that Hezbollah was prepared to go to war over the gas field dispute,118 prompting responses from Prime Minister Lapid and Defense Minister Gantz warning against escalation and stating Israel’s readiness to act against any threat and its interest in Lebanon’s stability and prosperity.119\n\nRussia’s Invasion of Ukraine\n\nIsrael has publicly condemned Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine through statements and votes in international fora. Meanwhile, it has sought to provide political support for Ukraine and humanitarian relief for Ukrainians—including allowing around 35,000 Jewish and non-Jewish refugees to enter Israel—without alienating Russia.120 As mentioned above, Israel has counted on airspace deconfliction with Russia to target Iranian personnel and equipment, especially those related to the transport of munitions or precision-weapons technology to Hezbollah in Lebanon.121\n\nDespite entreaties from Ukrainian officials, Israel has refrained to date from directly providing lethal assistance to Ukraine.122 Under some Western pressure, Israel has contemplated providing defensive equipment, personal combat gear, and/or warning systems to Ukraine’s military, partly to project to existing arms export clients that it would be a reliable supplier in crisis situations.123 Starting in May 2022, Israel has sent some protective gear to Ukrainian rescue forces and civilian organizations.124 Additionally, an Israeli media outlet reported in September that an Israeli company is in the process of supplying anti-drone systems to Poland, and that Poland is then able to sell the systems to Ukraine.125\n\nWhile Israel has not directly joined Western economic sanctions against Russia, Foreign Minister Lapid has said that Israel is determined to prevent Russians from using Israel to bypass sanctions.126 Observers debate the influence of prominent Russian or Russian-speaking Israelis within Israel.127 In a March 2022 interview on Israeli television, U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland said, “You don’t want to become the last haven for dirty money that’s fueling Putin’s wars.”128\n\nIn July 2022, Russia’s Justice Ministry signaled to Israel that it is seeking to close the Russian branch of the Jewish Agency for Israel, an entity that has branches around the world to facilitate emigration to Israel and run cultural and language education program in coordination with Israel. Russia is claiming that the agency has violated privacy laws by storing personal information about emigration applicants, but many Israelis suspect that Russian concerns about Israeli policy on Ukraine and possibly Syria and Jerusalem may be motivating the pending legal action.129 Prime Minister Lapid has warned Russia that closing the agency’s Russian branch would be a “grave event” with consequences for Israel-Russia relations.130\n\n*About the author: Jim Zanotti, Specialist in Middle Eastern Affairs\n\nSource: This article was published by CRS Summary R44245 (PDF)\n\nEndnotes:",
    "US senators refuse to let killing of Shireen Abu Akleh drop with Israel": "Israel has declared the case closed. The US state department has done its best to duck difficult questions. But leading members of the US Congress are refusing to drop demands for a proper accounting of the death of the Palestinian American journalist, Shireen Abu Akleh, four months ago.\n\nThe longest-serving member of the US Senate, Patrick Leahy, recently upped the ante by warning that Israel’s failure to fully explain the Al-Jazeera reporter’s killing could jeopardize America’s huge military aid to the Jewish state under a law he sponsored 25 years ago cutting weapons supplies to countries that abuse human rights.\n\nNearly half of the Democratic members of the Senate have signed a letter calling into question Israel’s claim that Abu Akleh was accidentally shot by a soldier. The letter suggests she may have been targeted because she was a journalist.\n\nThe Biden administration is also facing a flurry of legislative amendments and letters from members of Congress demanding that the state department reveal what it knows about Abu Akleh’s death and that the FBI launch an independent investigation.\n\nFew think there is much prospect of the US actually cutting its $3.8bn a year in military aid to Israel in the near future, but it is politically significant that so many senior Democrats have signed on to publicly challenge Israel, which has frequently been able to count on solid bipartisan support in America.\n\nAlthough criticism has focused on Abu Akleh’s death, the demands for accountability come as Israeli killings of Palestinians have escalated while Jewish settlers in the West Bank appear to have been given free rein at times to attack Palestinians and take over their land.\n\nDylan Williams, senior vice-president of policy and strategy at the Washington-based campaign group J Street, which describes itself as “pro-Israel and pro-peace”, said the demands for justice for Abu Akleh reflect broader concerns.\n\nIsraeli police confront mourners as they carry the casket of Shireen Abu Akleh during her funeral in East Jerusalem in May. Photograph: Maya Levin/AP\n\n“Members of Congress seem increasingly frustrated that these types of disturbing actions from Israeli forces continue to take place, without facing meaningful pushback or accountability from our government,” he said.\n\n“There’s growing momentum to make clear that Israel must be held to the same important standards as all close US allies, and that our steadfast support for Israel’s security does not and should not preclude our government from also standing up in defense of human rights and international law in the occupied Palestinian territory.”\n\nThe powerful American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac), which funds political campaigns against politicians critical of Israel, has lobbied against a US investigation of Abu Akleh’s death.\n\nBut Sarah Leah Whitson, director of Democracy for the Arab World Now – an advocacy group founded by the murdered Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi to pressure the US government to end support for authoritarian regimes in the Middle East – said that changing American public sentiment about Israel and the Palestinians has made it easier for some politicians to speak out.\n\n“There is an increasing view among the American public that Israel is committing the crime of apartheid, that Palestinians are unjustly victimised by Israel. This has given legislators more space, particularly secure legislators like Patrick Leahy, to say what they actually think,” she said.\n\n“In addition, they have more space on this particular case because Shireen Abu Akleh was a US citizen.”\n\nIsrael initially claimed that Abu Akleh was shot by a Palestinian during a military raid on the occupied West Bank city of Jenin in May. Earlier this month, it finally admitted that it was “highly probable” that an Israel Defence Forces (IDF) soldier killed the journalist but claimed the shooting occurred during a gun battle with Palestinian fighters.\n\nThat account was widely dismissed because investigations by human rights groups, the press and the United Nations showed that there was no fighting in Abu Akleh’s vicinity.\n\nLast week, Leahy told the Senate that the Biden administration had failed to act on calls from members of Congress for the FBI to investigate Abu Akleh’s death as is “customary and appropriate after a tragedy like this involving a prominent American killed overseas under questionable circumstances”.\n\n“Unfortunately, there has been no independent, credible investigation,” he said.\n\nLeahy challenged the value of Israel’s report on Abu Akleh’s death, noting there was “a history of investigations of shootings by IDF soldiers that rarely result in accountability”.\n\nSenator Patrick Leahy noted that there was ‘a history of investigations of shootings by IDF soldiers that rarely result in accountability’. Photograph: Amanda Andrade-Rhoades/EPA\n\nThe senator also questioned the state department’s role after the US security coordinator (USSC) in Jerusalem, Lt Gen Mark Schwartz, concluded that there was “no evidence to indicate [Abu Akleh’s] killing was intentional”.\n\nLeahy said: “The USSC, echoing the conclusion of the IDF, apparently did not interview any of the IDF soldiers or any other witnesses. To say that fatally shooting an unarmed person, and in this case one with ‘press’ written in bold letters on her clothing, was not intentional, without providing any evidence to support that conclusion, calls into question the state department’s commitment to an independent, credible investigation and to ‘follow the facts’.”\n\nLeahy has introduced an amendment, along with other senators, calling for the Biden administration to examine whether Israel has fallen afoul of the 1997 “Leahy Law” barring military assistance to countries whose armies abuse human rights.\n\n“Whether [Abu Akleh’s] killing was intentional, reckless or a tragic mistake, there must be accountability. And if it was intentional, and if no one is held accountable, then the Leahy Law must be applied,” Leahy said.\n\nSenator Chris Murphy, chair of the Senate foreign relations subcommittee responsible for the region, told MSNBC that he had not previously supported calls to set conditions for US military aid to Israel but that he was concerned about its conduct in the West Bank.\n\n“Some of [Israel’s] recent decisions are making conflict between Israel and the Palestinians more likely, not less likely,” he said. “I haven’t gotten there yet, arguing for conditions on that aid, but I think all of us are watching the behavior of the Israeli government very carefully.”\n\nSenator Chris Van Hollen: ‘I will continue pressing for full accountability and transparency around the death of Shireen. Anything less is unacceptable.’ Photograph: Reuters\n\nLeahy is backed by other senators including Chris Van Hollen, who pushed an amendment passed by the Senate foreign relations committee earlier this month requiring the state department to hand over a full copy of the USSC’s controversial report on Akleh’s death after the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, failed to respond to an earlier request and a series of questions.\n\n“I will continue pressing for full accountability and transparency around the death of Shireen. Anything less is unacceptable,” Van Hollen told the committee.\n\nVan Hollen was also instrumental in a letter in June signed by nearly half of all Democratic members of the Senate demanding “an independent, thorough, and transparent investigation” into her killing. The letter said disturbing comments by an Israeli official suggested she might have been targeted because she was a journalist.\n\n“On the day Shireen Abu Akleh was shot and killed, an Israeli military spokesperson, Ran Kochav, stated that Ms Abu Akleh and her film crew ‘were armed with cameras, if you’ll permit me to say so’,” the letter said.\n\n“We know you agree that journalists must be able to perform their jobs without fear of attack.”",
    "EU-Israel Council to take place despite ongoing settlement expansion": "The EU-Israel Association Council is preparing to meet for the first time in a decade, just before general elections in Israel in November, with Palestinian rights groups contending that Israel has entrenched its control of the occupied Palestinian territories through continued settlement construction and the activities of its security forces.\n\nIn the Palestinian district of Silwan in East Jerusalem, Israeli settlements have expanded in recent years because of the proximity of the site of the temple, which Israelis call the ‘City of David’.\n\n“Roughly 700 demolition orders for Palestinian houses there are in Silwan, that is experiencing the largest demolition plan in Jerusalem,” activists of the association Jerusalem Legal Aid and Human Right Centre told journalists.\n\nThe organisation said that there were no settlements before the 1993 Oslo accords, which sought a peaceful two-state solution, including mutual recognition of Israel and Palestine.\n\nNow, Israeli settlements are progressively growing in the middle of the area.\n\nRami Naser Eddin, executive director of Palestinian Vision, a Palestinian youth organisation established in 1998, explained how Israelis persuade or indirectly force Palestinians to live in different areas of Jerusalem.\n\n“They offer you lots of money for a house, or they make your life impossible”.\n\nEddin said that Palestinians in Jerusalem are treated as immigrants and every year they have to demonstrate with loads of paperwork that the centre of their life is in Jerusalem, otherwise they lose resident rights. “I need a lawyer for everything,” he said, “also to just get health care insurance”.\n\nHe also explained his problems in dealing with his house. “I need to renovate a room, but I do not have the permit from Israeli authorities for security reasons”.\n\nAccording to international law, the settlements are illegal, though the Israeli government disputes this and uses its forces to defend them.\n\nBut elections are approaching\n\nDespite the deteriorating situation, the EU wants to reach an agreement with Israel as soon as possible due to the upcoming Israeli elections.\n\nWhen the Association Council was announced in July, the EU’s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, insisted there was no reason to wait after the Israeli elections in November.\n\n“Who knows when the next Israeli government will be formed? Maybe it will be six months or a year,” Borrell said.\n\nEU ready to revive closer ties with Israel after decade of standstill Joint talks between the EU and Israel could resume for the first time in a decade before November, EU’s chief diplomat Josep Borrell confirmed on Monday (18 July).\n\n“At the moment, EU member states are finalising the EU statement, which will guide the EU’s position in the Association Council with Israel,” an EU official told EURACTIV.\n\nThe official added that the meeting would “provide an opportunity to engage on all topics related to EU-Israel relations, including human rights and the Middle East Peace Process”.\n\nHowever, organisations on the ground say the expansion of settlements and the tightening of Israeli security are reducing the prospects of peace.\n\nDuring a visit to the settlement near Jericho, a location in the desert at the border with Jordan, the representative of the West Bank Protection Consortium, Christopher Holt, told reporters that they are concerned about a lack of accountability for regular human rights abuses committed by Israeli security forces in the occupied territories.\n\nThe camps are in the so-called “area C” of the West Bank, controlled by the Israeli government.\n\nA far solution\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid backed a two-state solution in the UN General Assembly on Thursday (22 September), but stressed that this condition can be reached only if “a future Palestinian state will be a peaceful one, if it will not become another terror base from which to threaten the well-being and the very existence of Israel”.\n\n[Edited by Alexandra Brzozowski/Benjamin Fox]",
    "Hell revisited: Surviving Israel’s bombs to get married": "For Palestinians like Dr Izzeldin Abuelaish, planning a wedding is about hazard, hope and painful memories of loss.\n\nThis is a story that needs to be told. It needs to be told because it conveys – better than any human rights report – the capricious cruelties and indignities Palestinians endure in Gaza and what is possible when humanity trumps hate.\n\nIt is also, at times, the stuff that nightmares and some movies are made of.\n\nDr Izzeldin Abuelaish told me the story of hazard and hope when we spoke by phone shortly after he returned to his adopted home in Toronto, Canada, earlier this month.\n\nThe dogged, universally acclaimed Palestinian-Canadian doctor and teacher has devoted his life to harmony and healing. He is a man of peace who knows the indelible costs of war.\n\nOn January 16, 2009, two Israeli tank shells obliterated his home in Gaza. His daughters, Bessan, 21, Mayar, 15, and Aya, 13, and a niece, Noor, 17, were killed. Dr Abuelaish discovered their dismembered bodies.\n\nThe 67-year-old makes his way to Gaza and the West Bank often to tend to and provide for other Palestinians – especially children. It is, he says, a duty.\n\nIn late July, Dr Abuelaish arrived in Gaza with three of his surviving children, Dalal, Abdallah and, the bride-to-be, 29-year-old Shatha, to share with family and friends the joy of her upcoming wedding to Mohammed, a 32-year-old Palestinian-Jordanian.\n\nTheir long-distance courtship – spanning the United States, Canada and Saudi Arabia – was a year in the making. It began with exchanged notes, then more fulsome conservations. Although their families had known each other for years, Shatha and Mohammed – both computer engineers – met in Buffalo, New York for the first time in April. By May, they were engaged. The nuptials, set for August 9, would be held in Amman, Jordan.\n\nExcited and brimming with anticipation, Shatha welcomed her extended family in Gaza – 80 people in all – at the traditional henna party on July 30 to celebrate. She didn’t know then that she might be barred from traveling to attend her own wedding, for one reason alone: She is Palestinian.\n\nIsrael invades every aspect of Palestinian life – even their love lives. Early in September, the ministry of defence issued a “directive” ordering foreigners to report if they had become smitten with a Palestinian. Israel’s war on who, when, and where Palestinians can marry is an old, grotesque bureaucratic affront to decency.\n\nDr Abuelaish had planned to depart Gaza on August 4 joined by Shatha, Dalal and Abdallah, for Ramallah in the West Bank. From there, they would enter Jordan via the Allenby Bridge.\n\nBut those plans became casualties of this fact: Gaza is a prison and Israel is the prison’s warden. Israel decides who and what can come and go, who lives or dies, and when, of course, it chooses to raid, bomb or invade the narrow strip of Palestinian soil.\n\nOn August 2, Israel stopped rail traffic and closed roads along the Gaza border after it arrested an Islamic Jihad commander in the Jenin refugee camp, during a raid in which a Palestinian child was also shot dead. The brewing prospect that military tensions would escalate turned Shatha’s excitement and anticipation into fear and foreboding.\n\nFor Dr Abuelaish, it was hell revisited. “We couldn’t get out,” he said.\n\nA father who had already lost three daughters and a niece during an Israeli invasion was confronting the unimaginable horror that Shatha, Dalal and Abdallah were at similar, lethal risk in Gaza. “War does not discriminate,” Dr Abuelaish said. “In Gaza, you wait and ask: Who will be next?”\n\nSo, rather than wait, he acted to protect his children and to keep his promise to Shatha: She would be married in Amman on the date and time of their choosing, not Israel’s.\n\nTheir improbable odyssey out of Gaza would be dangerous and the outcome uncertain.\n\nOn August 3, Dr Abuelaish enlisted the help of influential contacts and friends on both the Israeli and Palestinian sides, made over decades attempting to mend that intransigent divide. Despite enjoying Canadian citizenship, Dr Abuelaish elected not to approach the country’s diplomats in Tel Aviv or Ramallah. He was convinced they would have just blamed him for putting his family in jeopardy by bringing them to Gaza.\n\nOn August 4, Dr Abuelaish was told by a Palestinian source that he and his family would be able to get out later that evening through Erez, the only crossing for people between Gaza and Israel. Accompanied by Palestinian drivers and guides, two golf carts carrying the family and their luggage made the short, treacherous journey towards the checkpoint.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel appeared poised to launch what it would soon describe as a “pre-emptive” assault on Gaza designed, once more, to pummel and terrorise Palestinians into submission. Given the looming danger, Dr Abuelaish was urged to turn back. He refused.\n\nThey arrived at the checkpoint at 10pm. Private Israeli security contractors spent 90 minutes checking the Abuelaishs’ credentials and luggage and ordered the family to leave for Bethlehem without their belongings since the Israeli military was anxious to close the crossing. Again, Dr Abuelaish refused.\n\nThe Israelis relented.\n\nA documentary crew – making a film on Dr Abuelaish’s life and work – arranged to meet him and his family on the Israeli side of the border and ferry them by van to Bethlehem using a maze of sandy, unfamiliar back roads. They were escorted briefly by Israeli security.\n\nRelieved and thankful, Dr Abuelaish credits the co-operation of Israelis and Palestinians for his family’s safe passage out of Gaza. “They made the impossible possible,” Dr Abuelaish said. “I will never forget.” And yet, his happiness was tinged with regret and worry for the Palestinians left behind in Israel’s crosshairs.\n\nEarly on August 5, Dr Abuelaish’s family finally made the 2km (1.2 mile) crossing into Jordan.\n\nThat afternoon, Israel began to bombard Gaza. Most of the 49 Palestinians killed were civilians. Seventeen were children.\n\nAmong the dead was 30-year-old Ismail Dweik. Since June, he had been engaged to Abeer Harb. The couple had spent months preparing for their wedding. On August 6, Harb waited six hours for her fiancé’s body to be removed from under the rubble of the shattered remnants of his home.\n\nThree days later, Shatha married Mohammed at a hotel in Amman in front of 150 guests. Their wedding was, Dr Abuelaish said, “a miracle” fashioned by “good people who believe in hope, rather than hatred, in fulfilling dreams, rather than crushing them, in being human, rather than inhuman”.\n\nStill, Dr Abuelaish admits that sadness and guilt are his constant companions. “I feel the pain and suffering of my brothers and sisters in Palestine,” he said. “I live it, too. Every moment of every day. There must be another way.”\n\nMore than anything, Dr Abuelaish misses his late wife, Nadia, who had died in 2008 of leukemia, and his lost daughters who ought to have been by their sister’s side in Amman. “They were missing,” he said. “The happiness I felt was incomplete because we were supposed to be together. Alive and together.”\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.",
    "Israel keeps flights coming as Jews flee Russia": "September 26, 2022\n\nImmigration and Absorption Minister Pnina Tamano-Shata convened an inter-ministerial meeting Sept. 22 including representatives of the foreign and finance ministries to prepare for a possible influx in Russian immigration to Israel after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced another 300,000 troops would be mobilized for the war in Ukraine Sept. 21.\n\nAhead of the meeting, Tamano-Shata said, “We see more requests to immigrate from Russia. I follow the [Russian Jewish] community and the ministry is doing its best to make sure all those wishing to can arrive safely, despite challenges. My ministry is preparing for a large-scale immigration wave. We’ve had talks with El Al and other airlines to find solutions to allow the Jewish community in Russia to immigrate.”\n\nAfter the meeting, the minister said, “We are doing everything in our power to help them reach us here in Israel safely, despite all the challenges that stand in their way at this time. My ministry is preparing for a massive absorption.”\n\nFinance Minister Avigdor Liberman said after the meeting that his ministry will allocate the necessary budgets for receiving the expected immigrants.\n\nReports across Europe say most of the flights going out of Russia were full, in what seems like a panic among the Russian population after Putin’s announcement. With American and European sanctions, few companies operate direct flights to Moscow. Jerusalem has not adopted official sanctions against Russia, so Israel’s national carrier El Al has maintained its Moscow-Tel Aviv service.\n\nEl Al's upcoming flights from Moscow are sold out at more than double the usual price, and tickets being resold on the black market. Flights from Moscow to Tel Aviv via Istanbul by Turkish Airlines are also fully booked for the coming week, except for a few business-class tickets. Reports in Israel say many Russian Jews are trying to flee the country over land, hoping to board a flight to Israel from a neighboring country.\n\nRussian authorities have reportedly denied requests by Israel to increase the number of El Al flights departing from Moscow. Israeli authorities are currently negotiating with Russian counterparts to replace the planes used for these flights with larger aircraft so more passengers may travel to Tel Aviv, but Moscow has not yet agreed.\n\nIsrael's law of return offers any person with a Jewish grandparent the chance to immigrate to Israel and become an Israeli citizen upon arrival. An estimated 200,000 people in Ukraine are eligible and close to 600,000 in Russia.\n\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine Feb. 24, Israel prepared for a wave of Ukrainian Jewish and non-Jewish refugees. The number of Jewish immigrants arriving from Ukraine was much lower than expected, but not negligible. The total number of immigrants arriving to Israel in 2022 is projected to reach about 64,000, a quarter of them from Ukraine and almost half from Russia. Many more Russian Jews already hold double Israeli/Russian citizenship and are not counted as new immigrants or refugees.\n\nRussia’s Chief Rabbi Pinchas Goldschmidt left Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. Interviewed by Israel’s public broadcaster KAN yesterday, Goldschmidt said, \"The situation will only get worse. I recommend to everyone who can get out to get out.\"\n\nOn Sept. 21, the Times of Israel quoted an unnamed senior Israeli official as condemning Putin’s decision to mobilize hundreds of thousands of reservists for the war in Ukraine, saying, “We have condemned in very clear language incidents like [the massacre in] Bucha. This falls under that. This call-up of 300,000 additional soldiers to further deepen a war that didn’t need to happen in the first place. The same of course goes for the threats to use nuclear weapons.”\n\nThe official added that Jerusalem is “worried in general for the Jews in Russia” and that already earlier this week, before Putin’s announcement, Prime Minister Yair Lapid had asked El Al to ensure that flights from Russia to Israel continue.",
    "Western democracy is being destroyed to protect Israel": "The past few days have seen an almost unprecedented attack on high-profile supporters of Palestine resulting in a concerted effort to silence some of Israel's most vocal critics once and for all. While this blatant attack on free speech has been rolled out it has also served to divert attention from a hard-hitting TV investigation exposing a campaign to undermine democracy and pro-Palestinian support in Britain's Labour Party.\n\nA damning three-part Al Jazeera TV documentary has based its findings on the content of the largest ever document leak in British political history. \"The Labour Files: The Purge\" has revealed how a small number of unelected officials plotted to bring Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's political juggernaut to a shuddering halt.\n\nIn a show of zero tolerance for free speech when it comes to criticising Israel and its Zionist friends, a number of pro-Palestinian voices, including academics, politicians and even Jews who refuse to kowtow to Tel Aviv, have been silenced through the Labour Party's extreme censorship.\n\nAstonishingly, instead of apologies or even resignations, the first episode of the documentary seems to have triggered a salvo of Zionist vitriol against even more critics of the apartheid state's brutal military occupation of Palestine. Such vicious campaigns serve only to encourage the sort of draconian censorship and attacks on freedom of speech that we associate with dictatorships.\n\nElements of the mainstream media are complicit either through self-censorship — to date, not one major news organisation has referred to the astonishing five-year campaign to destroy Corbyn —or selective reporting of facts on the ground. Or both.\n\nOPINION: Britain is haunted by its violent colonial past\n\nFor instance, two concerts planned in Poland by Pink Floyd co-founder Roger Waters were cancelled over the weekend amid outrage at the outspoken musician's open letter to Ukraine's first lady, Olena Zelenska. Waters told her that \"extreme nationalists\" in Ukraine \"have set your country on the path to this disastrous war.\"\n\nThe media knows that \"extreme nationalists\" is code for the far-right hooligan networks and militias of the Azov Battalion, which emerged in the fighting in Mariupol back in 2014. Today, nobody refers to their pro-Nazi, anti-Semitic credentials, or mention that they are on Kyiv's payroll as part of Ukraine's National Guard.\n\nEven the US government has described the Azov's political party, the National Corps, as a \"nationalist hate group\" and banned any of its military aid to Ukraine from reaching the battalion. According to the FBI, Azov is training and radicalising US white supremacists who are among the estimated 17,000 foreign right-wing extremists who have been drawn to Ukraine in recent years.\n\nRoger Waters was thus apparently silenced over his attempts to enlighten the world that maybe all is not what it seems in Ukraine. The last thing that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wants is a pro-Palestine rock star mouthing off in neighbouring Poland. Zelenskyy's close allies in Tel Aviv have long yearned to silence Waters by turning him into a social pariah for daring to criticise the Zionist colonial-occupation of Palestine.\n\nHence, the moment that Waters stepped away from the official line about Ukraine, Krakow City Councillor Lukasz Wantuch and his colleagues drafted a resolution to declare Waters persona non grata in Poland. Currently on tour in the US, the singer-activist responded on Facebook by saying, \"Hey Lukasz Wantuch, Leave them kids alone\", paraphrasing the lyrics of the classic Pink Floyd song \"Another Brick in the Wall\". He accused Wantuch of \"draconian\" censorship.\n\nWhile that drama was unfolding, under-fire Professor David Miller was told that his event with the Scottish Palestine Solidarity Campaign tonight (Monday) has been cancelled on the advice of Police Scotland. According to a report in the Jewish Telegraph, the police were involved in the decision of the Renfield Centre in Glasgow to cancel a booking by SPSC where Miller was to have spoken on \"Free Speech on Palestine — Stop the Witch-hunt\". The bitter irony will not have been lost on the academic who was hounded out of his job at Bristol University last year.\n\nWATCH: Zelenskyy shocked by Israel's failure to support Ukraine with weapons\n\n\"The centre says it was told by the police that Professor Miller was part of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel and they cancelled the meeting on safety grounds,\" explained SPSC co-founder Mick Napier. \"That is a contradiction in terms, because BDS is a nonviolent campaign called by Palestinian trades unions, churches, artists and academics against Israel's human rights breaches. The Scottish government recognises the right of public bodies to adopt BDS policies, but it seems that Police Scotland has decided otherwise.\"\n\nThe SPSC says on its website that the meeting will go ahead tonight either inside or outside the Bath Street premises, \"ban or no ban\". Another meeting with Miller is scheduled for Tuesday night in Edinburgh, despite Zionist pressure for that to be cancelled as well.\n\n\"If Police Scotland are now openly pressuring venues to cancel our meetings we have no recourse but to seek public support to oppose this sinister development,\" added Napier. \"[Prime Minister Liz] Truss and her crew are threatening to criminalise the democratic rights of asylum seekers, trade unionists and local authorities as well as pro-Palestine advocacy.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Naomi Wimborne-Idrissi has been suspended from Labour for speaking at an event organised by the left-wing group Resist, one of four organisations banned by Labour in July last year for downplaying what Labour Party officials described as \"systemic anti-Semitism\" within the party. Wimborne-Idrissi's suspension means that she can no longer take her seat on Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC), the 40-person body that meets this week at the party's annual conference in Liverpool, despite her being elected by grassroots members earlier this month.\n\nIs it a coincidence that she also appeared in the first episode of the Al Jazeera documentary? It's obvious that the Labour Party's pro-Israel officials wasted no time in working out a way to suspend her, and not for the first time. It also happened after she backed claims about the \"weaponisation\" of anti-Semitism allegations within Labour at a meeting of the Chingford and Woodford Green local party, of which she was vice-chair. That suspension was lifted shortly afterwards, but she was given a formal warning.\n\nWhat many people don't realise, though, is that Naomi Wimborne-Idrissi is a leading Jewish activist who has fought fascism and anti-Semitism all her life, but Zionists within Labour can't tolerate her criticism of Israel. So this particular Jewish voice has been silenced yet again.\n\nOPINION: The state of modern Britain and its monarchy\n\nOver in America, an extraordinary attempt to silence Democrat politician Rashida Tlaib may yet backfire after some Zionist groups claimed that the Palestinian American called for Israel's destruction. Jonathan Greenblatt of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) called her an anti-Semite and misinterpreted her words in a tweet, while the right-wing lobby group the Democratic Majority for Israel whipped up support against Tlaib. What she actually said was, \"You cannot claim to hold progressive values yet back Israel's apartheid government.\" Her many critics, though, have used a favourite Zionist trick of distorting her words.\n\nTlaib clearly hit a nerve, and anyone calling Israel an apartheid state incurs the wrath of Tel Aviv and its allies. The apartheid label attracted unwanted attention in the title of former US President Jimmy Carter's 2007 book, although the PLO pointed out in 1985 that \"Zionism is apartheid\". Moreover, leading human rights groups have since come to the same conclusion, including B'Tselem, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. All of this undermines the claim that Israel has progressive values. That could be why most of her fellow Democrats who attacked Tlaib self-censored themselves by avoiding any mention of the A-word in order to ignore the uncomfortable truth that Palestinians are forced to live in an apartheid state which treats them as lesser beings.\n\nIsrael and its supporters want to ban the use of the word apartheid; anyone who uses it faces being accused of anti-Semitism. Beth Miller of Jewish Voice for Peace Action put it succinctly when she said of Tlaib: \"The only Palestinian American member of Congress can't open her mouth without a coordinated campaign of slander and attacks with the intent of smearing her, twisting her words, and obscuring the undeniable reality that Israel is committing the crime of brutal apartheid over Palestinians.\"\n\nIf Tlaib's critics can't silence her, or have her expelled from her own party, then they simply make up what she is supposed to have said. For example, Greenblatt tweeted: \"In one sentence, @RepRashida simultaneously tells American Jews that they need to pass an anti-Zionist litmus test to participate in progressive spaces even as she doubles down on her #antisemitism by slandering Israel as an apartheid state.\" The truth is that Tlaib did not mention \"an anti-Zionist litmus test\" in her speech. Greenblatt simply made that up along with his suggestion that Tlaib was singling out American Jews.\n\n\"In one sentence,\" wrote Scott Roth in response, \"@JGreenblattADL conflates American Jews with Zionists, itself an anti-Semitic canard, while simultaneously defaming @RashidaTlaib as anti-Semitic for stating what's demonstrably provable.\"\n\nREAD: Poll: Support for 2-state solution retreating among Arabs, Jews in Israel\n\nOf course, this is nothing new for Tlaib, who was attacked last year merely for quoting from a human rights report which described Israel as an apartheid state. Political colleague Ted Deutch jumped to his feet automatically in the House of Representatives to condemn her for \"anti-Semitism\", claiming that she \"had besmirched our ally\" and called for the destruction of Israel.\n\nTlaib was once quoted as saying: \"I am tired of people functioning from a place of fear rather than doing what's right because of the bullying by pro-Israel lobbyists. This is apartheid, plain and simple.\"\n\nShe's right, but it is not just brave politicians who are being attacked in a leading democracy for exercising their democratic right to call out injustice when they see it. Activists of all faiths and none who dare to criticise the settler-colonial state faces being targeted, blacklisted and smeared. Western democracy is being destroyed in order to protect Israel.\n\nThat is the context within which the five-year campaign to wipe out Jeremy Corbyn and his supporters should be viewed. Likewise, the ongoing witch hunt against Professor Miller and the disgraceful ostracisation of Jews who stand up for the legitimate rights of the people of occupied Palestine. As the situation in Scotland today suggests, even the police are getting in on the act. Such abuse of the law and misuse of police powers to curb freedom of speech has to stop.\n\nIf Israel and its supporters have to damage their own democracy in an effort to shut down criticism of the apartheid state, what does that say about the regime they are so desperately trying to prop up? What hold does Israel have over the West? Whatever it is, the price to pay surely cannot and should not be the erosion of our democratic rights.\n\nThe Scottish Palestine Solidarity Campaign is showing us the way in this respect. We mustn't throw in the towel and cancel that next pro-Palestine meeting on campus, in civil society or anywhere else. Far from it. The Palestinians have had to face much worse for seventy years and counting, and continue to endure a brutal apartheid regime and military occupation. The least we can do is stand up to the pro-Israel lobby and expose the fact that it defends a cruel, apartheid state which no self-respecting democrat should support.\n\nOPINION: American democracy has been turned into an illusion\n\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Monitor.",
    "Israel’s August raid on Palestinian NGOs aimed to halt International Criminal Court, UN investigations": "In August 2022, the Israeli Defense Forces conducted dawn raids on the offices of seven Palestinian human rights NGOs. The targeted organizations included groups working to support Palestinian women and children, as well as political prisoners. The Israeli government justified shutting down the organizations under the pretext that they were fronts for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). The organizations have rigorously denied the allegations, and vowed to continue their work in spite of Israeli repression. Sahar Francis, General Director of the Addameer Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association, joins The Marc Steiner Show to explain why these organizations have come into the crosshairs of the Israeli government. Francis explains that a key motivation for the raids was the work of her and other organizations to advance investigations for Israel’s crimes through the UN and International Criminal Court. In order to consolidate the occupation and complete the annexation of Palestine, the Israeli government must target and destroy any resistance. While Francis denies the allegations of Addameer’s connections to the PFLP, she points out that the PFLP is not considered a terrorist organization under international law due to the special circumstance of Palestine as an occupied territory.\n\nSince 2006, Sahar Francis has been the General Director of Ramallah-based Addameer Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association, a Palestinian NGO providing legal and advocacy support to Palestinian political prisoners in Israeli and Palestinian prisons.\n\nStudio: Dwayne Gladden\n\nPost-Production: Brent Tomchik\n\nTranscript\n\nMarc Steiner: Welcome to The Marc Steiner Show here on The Real News. I’m Marc Steiner, and it’s great to have you all with us.\n\nIn early August, the Israeli government raided, at the crack of dawn, the offices of six Palestinian NGOs, claiming they were front organizations for the PFLP, which is the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. And despite that claim, the Israeli government has not revealed any proof that these organizations are even remotely connected to the PFLP, even after the European Union demanded such proof. Those organizations were the backbone of civilian public agencies, working with farmers, children, and fighting against the mass imprisonment of Palestinians. So, these organizations, Al-Haq, Addameer, The Bisan Center, the Defense for Children International Palestine, the Union of Agricultural Works Committees, and the Union of Palestinian Women’s Committees, had their doors sealed shut, their computers and all their equipment seized, and the leaders of all those organizations are still under threat of imprisonment themselves.\n\n\n\nSo today we’re joined by one of the leaders of those NGOs, Sahar Francis. She’s a Palestinian human rights activist, defender, and general director of the Addameer Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association. Sahar Francis is a lawyer fighting against the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory, and as director of Addameer, she focuses on the political and civil rights issues in the occupied territories, especially those of political prisoners and detainees.\n\nSo, Sahar, welcome back. It’s a pleasure to have you with us here on The Marc Steiner Show.\n\nSahar Francis: Thanks.\n\nMarc Steiner: But this is not a very pleasant time, obviously. And if we could take a step backwards for just a minute, and just in context about the organizations that were raided, why they were raided, and what the Israeli government did, and then we’ll get into the meat of where you are now. So give us a little background to this.\n\nSahar Francis: So Addameer, my organization, we are a Palestinian organization that supports Palestinian prisoners with legal aid and advocacy and documentation and research. All the other colleagues, like the other six organizations that we were raided and designated, we all work in human rights, in the health sector, in the agriculture sector, in children’s rights, in women’s rights, and offering research and development studies. I believe that our work, and especially on the international level in protecting human rights and promoting accountability, exhausting the UN mechanisms and other international tools like the International Criminal Court, was the main reason behind the Israeli campaign against these organizations and other Palestinian civil society organizations.\n\n\n\nThis smear campaign started couple of years ago – If not more than one decade – Attacking the organizations, the people working in these organizations, distributing false information about us as individuals, about our work. And it all failed, actually, to affect seriously our work, so I believe the last tool was in the hands of the Israeli authority is to use the anti-terror law and the military orders in order to illegalize us as organizations. And this is what happened last year, actually, last October. And last week, they decided to raid the offices and close the doors and seal the doors, actually. In some organizations, they confiscated property. They took laptops, photocopiers, files, and data, and sealed the doors of the seven organizations, hanging a military order forcing the closure of the seven organizations for an indefinite period.\n\n\n\nMarc Steiner: So, one of the things that I heard you talk about in another program, it might have been on Democracy Now!, was that you believe that Israel raided your group and the others to send a message to Europe as well. And so I’m curious how you think the Europeans are going to respond to this, because so far the Americans, the American government, has remained really silent. They’ve not said much. So what do you think that message is?\n\nSahar Francis: Actually, to put it in the correct context as well, before the designation, the Israeli intelligence prepared a dossier, a secret dossier, that was submitted to the European countries, mainly those that financially support the organizations, in order to affect their decision to suspend their financial support for us, and it failed. And this is why we believe Israel at the end decided to designate the organizations. Then, the European countries were examining this information, the intelligence information that they received. And lately, in July, they issued a joint statement by 10 European countries that they are the main funders for the civil society organizations in the occupied territories, actually clarifying that the secret information that the Israeli intelligence offered for them wasn’t sufficient, wasn’t enough in order to base such a serious decision against the organizations on, and they decided to continue with supporting the organizations. So, this is why we believe that the raid, the physical raid for the offices, is a kind of a message for these countries. No matter what your position, we can force the closure of these organizations on the ground.\n\nMarc Steiner: I wonder what kind of personal trepidation and fear you might have for your own safety at this moment? I mean, already two other Palestinian leaders were brought and were told to come and to be interrogated. But what do you think could happen as a result of this?\n\nSahar Francis: We expect the worst, actually. Personally, not just the senior staff in these organizations could be arrested, could be harassed, but any employee or any person that is in contact, volunteering, or offering any service to these organizations could be liable under the military orders and the Israeli procedures. So, people could be arrested, could be prosecuted and sentenced for long periods. There are also other measures that could be taken against the individuals on a personal level in order to harass and affect and intimidate and threaten us from continuing our work, and it includes a ban on travel outside the country, canceling any permit that you have for entering inside Israel, or moving from one place to another. They can affect family unification procedures for individuals. They can arrest family members of people and harass them. Lots of procedures, actually, that the occupation were using so far against human rights defenders and activists in the occupied territory.\n\nMarc Steiner: You were banned from leaving the country, right? That happened before this?\n\nSahar Francis: I was banned board by American Airlines, actually. And later on, I received a message from the US Embassy in Tel Aviv that my visa was revoked. Not clear what’s the basis for this step, but my banned travel was forced by the United States and not by the Israeli side.\n\nMarc Steiner: So, I think that’s fairly shocking as well, that someone had reported to me it was the Israeli government. The fact that the US government not only has not responded to these raids and calling your organizations terrorists, when in fact they’re not, they’re human rights organizations. Now you’re saying the American government has somehow been complicit in banning you from traveling from Palestine, from your home, to anywhere else to talk or to meet with people.\n\nSahar Francis: Exactly. This is an indirect implementation for the Israeli decision against the organizations. As you said, instead of taking a clear position while they kind of said as well as the Europeans, that the information is not sufficient. So, they didn’t take any concrete or clear measures. So, indirectly they’re implementing the Israeli decision by putting these restrictions, whether on the ability to travel via the United States. I was supposed to attend the World Social Forum in Mexico – I wasn’t traveling to the United States – And I was banned. So, other colleagues like Ubai Al-Aboudi, the director of Bisan Center, he is a United States citizen, but he was banned by the Israeli authorities from attending the World Social Forum, and the United States did nothing in support of their own citizen that was facing such a measure.\n\nMarc Steiner: Well, that’s something we need to look into a great deal deeper. And I think that, going back to the situation that you face at the moment and the others face in these organizations, I think it was a quote that came from you – If not, you can correct me [laughs]. But when you said, why the Israeli government did this was, we are the masters, we are the ones who control the occupied territory and decide who could continue and not in reality on the ground. I mean, what happened to all of you and your organizations is really Orwellian, and it’s like 1984 that Palestinians seem to have to live under, especially those of you who are leading the struggle for equality and for independence. So talk a bit about that and what it’s like to have to survive in that.\n\nSahar Francis: It is very difficult, because we are subjected to two different legal systems at the end of the day as well. Like the Israeli authority, the minister, basically when designating us according to the anti-terror law, he used the Israeli law to be implemented on the occupied territories. This is a very serious violation of the international law, for the standards of the international law. And at the same time, they use the military orders as well against us as an occupying power. And at the end of the day, we have to face this reality, and we decided to continue. We will not back up because we believe this is totally in order to silence us because it seems we are succeeding in the work that we are trying to do at the international level. Especially, as I said, on the accountability level, working with the UN, different bodies, highlighting the war crimes and the crimes against humanity and all the other serious violations that the Israeli occupation is committing systematically in the occupied territories.\n\n\n\nThis is what makes the occupation worried about our work. It’s not true that we are associated in any illegal activities or terrorist activities. And this is very clear because, for Addameer, we have been existing for around 30 years and working on a daily basis versus the Israeli system, the military courts, or the prison system, and so on. Why now all of a sudden we have become a terrorist organization? It’s totally connected to our work against torture, against arbitrary detention, and naming the military system as a war crime because it’s not offering a fair trail procedures and standards for the thousands of Palestinian prisoners that they are detained yearly and prosecuted in front of this system.\n\n\n\nThis is what bothers the Israeli occupation, and this is why we became dangerous organizations in the Palestinian context. But we believe that it’s not going to stop here, because we believe that, for the occupation, in order to continue in implementing their plan in the annexation, any organization, any group that will resist this, that will work hard in order to prevent these plans, will be facing an attack and illegalizing like we face. Because all the organizations that are trying to protect farmers in Area C or house demolition policies or supporting Bedouin communities that are supposed to be displaced from sensitive areas like what’s going on now in Masafer Yatta or in other communities, will be attacked, will be facing the same attacks that we faced as six organizations.\n\nMarc Steiner: Before we let you go, and I know you have a very busy time trying to keep all this together and keep this alive, what do you think – Two questions here. A, you all have been accused of being front organizations for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the PFLP. That was the excuse. So A, speak to that, because I want people to hear what your response is to that. And then I also want to talk to you about what you will all do from here. What happens next for you? But let’s start with that accusation that you all are front organizations for the PFLP.\n\nSahar Francis: So, actually this is the false information that the Israeli intelligence and the Israeli right-wing groups that were established in order to attack Palestinian civil society organizations, especially after the very important case of the ICJ ruling on the wall in 2004, when the ICJ decided and confirmed that it’s occupation, that both the international humanitarian law and human rights law should be implemented, and requested Israel to dismantle the wall, and all the organizations started the boycott, divestment, and sanctions campaign. And then the whole work on the accountability level became more serious. And then the campaign, the serious attack against the Palestinian civil society started. So, the way the Israelis can justify this link with terrorism is linking the different Palestinian NGOs with the political parties that already designated or declared as terrorist organizations by the Israelis or in the US context or in Europe.\n\n\n\nAnd we should highlight that all the Palestinian political parties that are considered terrorist by the EU or the US are not declared so according to the UN standards. They aren’t included in any UN list. Because of the unique circumstances of the Palestinian context, being a people under occupation and all what the international law enables the people under occupation to use as tools in order to resist the occupation. But as organizations, Israel is trying to use – Every Palestinian could be arrested, prosecuted, and we all know there’s not enough time now to enter into all the procedures in front of the military court, in the torture, in how they obtain confessions in this system. The whole coercive atmosphere that brings the detainees at the end to accept a plea bargain in order to make their detention as short as they can, so they plead guilty for anything in order to be released, because they are fully aware that they will be rearrested and they could be facing administrative detention without charges, without fair trial, without any legal procedures.\n\n\n\nSo, this is how the intelligence collects their information. This is how this whole story was designed. And this secret information report that was presented for the European countries in order to make this connection between the organizations and the Popular Front, and this was rejected by the 10 European countries, and actually by all the countries that received this information. So, this is the way the Israeli occupation forces were using secret information and collecting evidence, out of torture and all these methods. Not just now, since the beginning of the occupation. More than 400 other, 450, actually, other Palestinian organizations, charitable organizations, unions, student movements are designated as terrorist and illegalized by the military orders. It’s not just these six organizations. This is the way the Israelis are controlling the Palestinian society in order to maintain the occupation as long as they can.\n\nSo, how will we face all this? We will continue, because it’s not a job. It’s not about the work that we are doing just in order to work. It’s our struggle against the occupation, against the illegality of the occupation. It’s our struggle to seek justice. It’s our self-determination as a people. So, even with the high price that we can pay as individuals, being arrested or harassed, or affected, I think, our vision and our mission as human rights defenders, that we decided to be committed to the international standards of human rights. We will continue this because we know deeply that we will succeed at the end of the day, because the truth will conquer at the end of the day.\n\nMarc Steiner: So, Sahar, I will let you go here. I just have to ask one last quick thing. Is there a very real chance that the Israeli government could come after you, your staff, freeze your bank accounts, just completely shut you down? I mean, is that the next step? Is that something you are preparing for? Have there been any indications that that’s going to happen?\n\nSahar Francis: Of course, it can happen. The fact that they raided in the way that they did last Thursday was a clear message that they can do it. And we expect that they will continue unless there is really serious pressure coming from the United States and sending a clear message to the Israeli side that they should cancel their decision and stop all measures against the organizations and the people working in these organizations. And of course from the European side. I mean, it is the time for the international community to implement human rights in a correct way and not to work with double standards. And we all know that there are ways to make Israel abide to the international law and respect the rights of the Palestinian people.\n\nMarc Steiner: Sahar Francis, first of all, thank you for your work. Thanks for taking the time today. I know it’s a very busy time for you. And we will stay in touch and continue to follow this. I will stay in touch and continue to follow this here. And we will keep watching over your safety as much as we can from thousands of miles away. So, thank you very much for joining us.\n\nSahar Francis: Thank you. Thank you for the support.\n\nMarc Steiner: It will always be there. As someone who is Jewish and formerly a Zionist, who had family who was killed in the Holocaust and people who sat in my living room with numbers on their arms as a child, knowing their stories in the Holocaust, this makes me and many other Jewish people stand up and say, no, not in our name.\n\nSahar Francis: Exactly.\n\nMarc Steiner: And I want to thank you for your work.\n\nSahar Francis: Thank you.\n\nMarc Steiner: Thank you. Thank you.\n\n\n\nI hope you enjoyed the conversation with Sahar Francis in the occupied territories in the West Bank, where she heads Addameer. And once again, thank all of you for joining us today. And please let me know what you thought about what you heard today, what you’d like us to cover. Just write to me at mss@therealnews.com and I’ll get right back to you. And if you have an extra minute, go on over to www.therealnews.com and become a monthly donor, become part of the future with us. So for Stephen Frank, Dwayne Gladden, Kayla Rivara, and the crew here at The Real News, I’m Marc Steiner. Stay involved, keep listening, and take care.",

    "In This Stretch of Desert, Israel Plans to Build Its First New Kibbutz in Decades": "For the first time in more than 30 years, a new kibbutz is to be established in Israel.\n\nA decision to move ahead with the plan to set up a new cooperative settlement in the eastern part of the Negev desert was approved last week by the Kibbutz Movement, the umbrella organization for Israel’s roughly 230 secular kibbutzim. (The religious kibbutzim, of which there are about 20, belong to a separate organization.)\n\nRepresenting a unique experiment in communal living, the kibbutz has become one of Israel’s best-known global brands.\n\nThe new kibbutz, which has yet to be named, will be one of five new communities slated for establishment on the outskirts of the desert city of Arad (situated some 135 kilometers, or 83 miles, southeast of Jerusalem).\n\nThe plan to set up this cluster of communities – which will also include a town designated for the Bedouin community and one for ultra-Orthodox Jews – was approved by the government in March.\n\nIsrael’s kibbutzim hit hard times in the 1980s, raising questions about the viability of the socialist principles upon which they were founded. In order to survive, the vast majority underwent various forms of privatization and began requiring members to pay for basic necessities like food. Instead of receiving a monthly stipend based on their needs, members also started earning salaries that were determined by the type of positions they filled.\n\nAs a result, very few kibbutzim today still embrace the old-fashioned principles of collective living.\n\n“Renewed kibbutzim” is the code word for those that have undergone privatization, with the new desert kibbutz set to join their ranks. In other words, it will have no communal mess hall, no communal laundromat and no communal children’s houses (where kids sleep separately from their families) – in fact, none of the classic feature of an archetypal kibbutz.\n\nWhen asked why not, Nir Meir, secretary-general of the Kibbutz Movement, responds: “We don’t want to start building something we’ll eventually have to shutter. We’ve already been there and done that.”\n\nWhat will distinguish it from other rural communities, he says, is joint ownership of common facilities.\n\nThe decision on what to call the new kibbutz will be taken by its members. But if they were to ask him, says Meir, he would recommend a name that pays tribute to Aharon Yadlin – one of the last giants of the Labor Zionist movement who died last month at age 96.\n\nThe plan is to recruit 100 families to the kibbutz, which will include a large plot of agricultural land to accommodate those interested in farming. The first families should be able to move into temporary housing facilities in about two years, Meir says.\n\nOpen gallery view A road in the Eastern Negev outside of Arad. Credit: Eliyahu Hershkovitz\n\nHe anticipates tremendous demand for this rare opportunity to be part of a new cooperative settlement. “Right now, we have a list of somewhere between 30,000 to 40,000 people who would move onto existing kibbutzim tomorrow if only we had room,” he says. “But whoever applies needs to know that we’re looking for people who understand that this is a lifetime commitment and not just an adventure for a few years.”\n\nSurprised but happy\n\nSome 200,000 Israelis live on kibbutzim today, with about a third of them full-fledged members.\n\nThe first kibbutz, Degania Aleph, was established in 1909 (in what was then Ottoman Palestine). The last, Neot Semadar, was established in 1989 in the southern Arava Desert. The government implemented a huge bail-out plan for the kibbutzim in the 1980s. Ever since, it has discouraged the establishment of new ones.\n\n“Our position has always been that we will not push ourselves,” Meir says. “But if and when the government decides to set up new communities, we want to be there too. So, when the decision was taken to build new communities in the Eastern Negev, we reached out to the authorities and said we’d like one of these communities to be a kibbutz. They were actually very surprised, but also very happy.”\n\nInitially, the municipality in Arad was dead set against the plan to establish these communities on its outskirts. “We felt that before the government sets up anything new, it should be investing in strengthening existing cities like ours,” says Mayor Nisan Ben-Hamo.\n\nAfter considerable lobbying on his part, the cabinet passed another resolution to invest tens of millions of shekels in the coming years in strengthening Arad and other places in the Eastern Negev.\n\nOpen gallery view The area around Arad that is set to become Israel's first kibbutz in over 30 years.

    "What’s Israel's next move if the Iran nuclear deal fails?": "What does the Israeli government really want from Iran? Major consequences hang on the answer to this question, not just regarding Iran, but across the Middle East. On that answer also hangs whether there will be open war with Iran involving Israel and almost certainly the United States, with significant repercussions throughout the region and beyond.\n\nIn the United States, Israel’s concerns are assumed to focus primarily on Iran’s nuclear program and the possibility that it will acquire one or more nuclear weapons in the not-too-distant future. That prospect can certainly not be ruled out, given that the Vienna talks on renewing the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) or an updated version of it, are in an almost daily on-again, off-again status, while Iran continues apace with its nuclear program.\n\n\n\nFrom the U.S./Israeli side, time has just about run out for a rapid resolution and thus a halt to Iran’s nuclear work, at least until sometime after Israel’s November 1 elections and U.S. midterm voting on November 8. The Iranian issue has a major impact on Israeli politics; in the United States, it’s more of a niche issue, but one of concern to a large number of significant leaders with sizeable political clout, especially in Congress, the White House, and the State Department.\n\nThe Israeli government has consistently opposed any nuclear agreement, beginning well before the JCPOA was concluded. Its efforts to prevent it included an unprecedented appeal by former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to a joint session of Congress. That stance, as well as pressure from several of his biggest campaign donors, obviously influenced President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the agreement in May 2018 and reimpose sanctions.\n\nNow, Jerusalem’s opposition to the Biden administration’s returning to the JCPOA is in high gear, with many public statements and visits by top officials to Washington to argue for scrapping the JCPOA forever. This case is being buttressed by the fact that some JCPOA provisions would anyway “sunset” in a few years, with the relevant UN Security Council Resolution (2231) terminating in October 2025.\n\n\n\nOf course, concerns on this point ignore the four years wasted since Trump pulled out of the JCPOA and renewed sanctions, leading Iran to respond by renewing its nuclear work. Rarely discussed, as well, is that following JCPOA Implementation Day in January 2016, Iran exported almost all of its enriched uranium and poured concrete into its plutonium-producing nuclear reactor. But when Washington broke the agreement, so did Tehran, although it waited a full year before doing so.\n\nIf nothing changes, the upshot is likely to be Iran’s moving toward the ability (if not the intent) to produce a bomb. If so, then both Jerusalem and Washington could in the not-to-distant future decide whether to use military force to destroy Iranian nuclear-related capabilities, if not also to do more militarily. Indeed, at the UN General Assembly this week, President Joe Biden renewed his pledge that “We will not allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon.” Any debate about whether a nuclear-capable Iran could be deterred has been ruled out.\n\nIn theory, Israel might be able to destroy Iran’s nuclear programs relying only on its own military capabilities. These could be buttressed by long-range U.S. strike capabilities, but some of the most important capabilities, especially mid-air refueling tankers, are currently not likely to be delivered to Israel by 2025. At this point, however, it is hard to believe that Israel could successfully conduct a major attack against Iran without a direct U.S. combat role.\n\n\n\nYet even if it did not join Israeli attacks on Iran, the United States, as Jerusalem’s long-term backer, would find itself in Tehran’s crosshairs across the region. Further, Israel would have to assess the possible costs in terms of attacks directed against its homeland, especially from Lebanon’s Hezbollah, which has the capacity to cause serious damage and casualties in Israel, despite the latter’s significant defensive capabilities.\n\nIt’s thus hard to argue that Israel’s current gamble focused on preventing Washington from rejoining the JCPOA is likely to promote its own security.\n\nAlong with some Arab countries, Israel also has concerns about what it sees as additional threats posed by Iran, especially in supporting terrorism and instability. (Yemen and Iraq are most often cited, as well as Lebanon.) All of them want to push back against Iran’s assertion for greater power and influence in the region. Some Israeli leaders would also like to see “regime change” in Iran or even its disintegration as a single country, as effectively happened in Iraq with the U.S. and Israeli-blessed 2003 invasion.\n\nBut from America’s perspective of its own security interests, Israeli and Arab hopes of destroying Iran’s nuclear program and possibly more, however desirable, are very much secondary. Further, if there were a military attack on Iran that vastly reduced its military capacities, it’s doubtful that Arab states would continue to see much value in developing relations with Israel, at least for political, if not high-tech economic reasons. That could lead to the collapse of the Abraham Accords on which both Israel and the United States have placed such store.\n\nCritically important, of course, is that Iran is also placing difficulties in the way of success in the Vienna talks and restoration or replacement of the JCPOA. Iran’s clerical leadership in effect has been pursuing a parallel course, at the very least wanting to get a deal that would go beyond what is provided for in the JCPOA. Notably, it wants assurances that the United States would not again pull out of any deal that was agreed, as Trump did in 2018. Further, at the UN General Assembly this week, Iran’s president, Seyyed Evrahim Raisi, repeated many of the Iranian government’s dominant themes, including placing the burden for problems on the United States — though he also emphasized the importance of “dialogue and negotiations.”\n\nIn sum, if Israel’s intensive efforts to block the JCPOA succeed, reinforced by today’s parallel negativism and risk-taking by the Iranian clerics, they would dramatically increase the chances of a war that could be catastrophic for everyone. This is not to argue that reinvigorating the JCPOA will solve all the security and other problems regarding Iran. But it remains the best and necessary first step.\n\nThis discussion leads back to the beginning: what does Israel really want regarding Iran? Has it thought through the possible consequences of its current policies? Or is it just acting on autopilot, without understanding that, if carried to its logical conclusion, its current course contains a high risk of open conflict, embroiling not just Iran and Israel, but also the United States and others, with negative consequences for all? The United States would not abandon Israel, but it would be unlikely to say “thank you” if there is another Middle East war.\n\nTo venture out on the high wire without a reliable safety net below is never a good approach.",
    "Israel's challenges in the new year: economy and society": "i24NEWS journalists weigh in\n\nWith Israelis celebrate Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, on Sunday evening, the Jewish state will have to negotiate several turning points in the coming months that may prove decisive for its future, whether in the political, diplomatic, military, societal or economic fields. What follows is a brief overview of the major issues facing the Jewish state by i24NEWS journalists.\n\nCOST OF LIVING\n\nBy now it is a well-known refrain: we pay much more in Israel than elsewhere. Rising prices are becoming increasingly unbearable for an ever greater proportion of Israelis. The strengthening of the shekel could have lowered the prices of imported products, \"could\" being the operative word. In a market where competition is weak, inflation and the rise in interest rates in recent months have not helped to reduce household bills. This was a stated priority of the new government, but it is proving to be an uphill battle, and the authorities appear helpless.\n\nFor David Neeman, a journalist specializing in economics, Israel will have to contain the impact of global inflation on the country, at the risk of seeing prices continue to soar. However, he remains optimistic.\n\n\"Israel's advantage lies in its monetary leeway acquired thanks to the budgetary rigor which has been in place for twenty years,\" he explains.\n\n“Israel has a very low debt ratio compared to the West, the pandemic notwithstanding. Dollar reserves are full, the shekel is very strong, and interest rates are lower than in the US, so the Bank of Israel can raise rates if inflation ever gets out of control,” he adds.\n\nMeanwhile, many Israelis are leaving the country, angered by the cost of living. The number of departures remains marginal but they reveal a very real disarray.\n\nREAL ESTATE\n\nReal estate remains the favorite topic of conversation among Israelis. The inexorable rise in prices is a central concern for those who fear that they will never be able to acquire property. The supply is infinitely lower than the demand and the acceleration of housing construction will become a national priority, while the population continues to grow and its needs will therefore increase.\n\nTRANSPORT\n\nThe launch of the first light rail line in Tel Aviv, scheduled for the end of November, is a game changer and, supposedly, a sign of things to come. The project's express purpose is to decongest the central region, plagued by monster traffic jams.\n\nNeeman points out that \"a lot has already been done in the field of transport in recent years,\" not least an extension of the train lines planned to Kyriat Shmona in the north, and to Eilat in the south. In the meantime, the traffic jams, which affect the whole country, are \"the scourge of Israelis' everyday life,\" and therefore \"undermine their productivity.\"\n\nHIGH TECH\n\nThe prospects for high tech, the main driver of the country's economy in the past decade, are rather good and continue to justify the moniker of Start-Up Nation, despite the crisis that the sector experienced before the summer. According to Fleur Sitruk, editor-in-chief of i24NEWS' Innov'Nation magazine, \"next year holds great opportunities for investors in Israel, especially with regard to the so-called 'seeds,' or nascent startups, because the global crisis resulted in the stabilization of the market and the readjustment of the value ​​of the hithertofore overvalued companies.\"\n\nWhile 2022 got off to a slower start than 2021, which had reached record levels in terms of investment, Israeli companies still raised nearly $10 billion in the first half of the year.\n\n“The sectors that are on the rise are of course still cybersecurity, fintech, IoT (the \"internet of things\") and food tech. We are also seeing the emergence of a new field that is growing exponentially: 'climate tech' (sustainable innovation), with more than 700 specialized companies, confirming the ability of Israeli high-tech to adapt to the new challenges of the global economy,\" Sitruk adds.\n\nINEQUALITY\n\nIsrael has seen an unprecedented economic boom over the past decade, linked in particular to the great success of the high-tech sector and substantial investments. The country has nearly 107,000 millionaires out of a population of 9.7 million (one for every 90!), but must also deal with growing social inequalities, considered to be among the highest in the world.\n\nHalf of the population earn on average only 57,900 shekels per year (16,930 euros) while the richest 10% of the country earn 1,096,300 shekels (320,700 euros), or 19 times more.\n\n\"There is a high-tech powerhouse whose employees are earning a very good living and the rest of the economy, apart from a few sectors here and there, is lagging behind, especially in terms of remuneration which does not keep pace with the rise in the cost of living,\" notes Dror Even-Sapir.\n\nTHE ARAB COMMUNITY\n\nViolence in the Arab community remains a matter of great concern. 126 murders were recorded in 2021 and the figures are expected to be similar in 2022. In addition to the tragedies for the families of the victims and the appalling reality that it contains, this violence also reveals the existence of powerful criminal organizations in Israel that act with total impunity. The authorities are for the moment the helpless witnesses of this disastrous spectacle. And until this violence is checked, crime will continue to thrive.\n\n\"Internal violence has not been curbed and is endemic,\" Even-Sapir says. \"It's hard to see how this could not have repercussions on the rest of Israeli society,\" he adds.\n\nNEW RUSSIAN ALYAH\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has had direct repercussions on Israel: the country has already taken in 24,000 Russian immigrants, most of them opposed to the war, who have benefited from the law of return to settle in the Jewish state. Israel also took in 19,000 Ukrainians, many of whom only obtained refugee status, not nationality.\n\n“Paradoxically, it is mainly Jews from Russia who come to Israel,” notes Pierre Klochendler, correspondent for i24NEWS.\n\n“With the partial mobilization announced last week, Israel expects a new wave of immigration from Russia in the weeks and months to come,” he explains.\n\nThe Jewish state is now responsible for absorbing these large waves, even if this is hardly novel after the ultimately successful integration of nearly a million Jews from the former Soviet Union in the 1990s. Jerusalem now has the responsibility of guaranteeing Russian Jews who so desire the possibility of making aliyah, as the Jewish Agency in Moscow is subject to a Kremlin clampdown.\n\nAbove all, Israel must continue its balancing act of condemning Russian abuses in Ukraine while cajoling its diplomatic relations with Moscow, in order to continue bringing Jews out of the country, and to guarantee its freedom of action against Iranian and pro-Iranian forces in Syria.\n\nCULTURE\n\nAmid this flurry of challenges, a positive vibe issues forth from a film released earlier this month that will represent the country at the Oscars. \"Cinema Sabaya\" by director Orit Fouks Rotem features eight women, four Jews and four Arabs, who take part in a film course. Their interactions reflect with disconcerting realism and without a trace of Manichaean binaries, the complexity of the Israeli reality, made up of paradoxes, conflicts and humanity.\n\n\"Cinema Sabaya\" is a joyful and important film that offers an intelligent perspective, one that's tethered to reality and far removed from crude anti-Israeli clichés; it is a rare object of tenderness, finesse, directness. Which is to say, many ingredients that Jews celebrating Rosh Hashana are hoping to sample in their celebratory meal in order to afford the year to come a truly special flavor.\n\nShana tova.",
    "US Democrat support for Palestine higher as Israeli 'self-defence' narrative collapses": "Support for Palestine has surged in the US over recent years, especially among young adults where there has been a dramatic shift. Sixty-one per cent of American adults under 30 have a favourable view of the Palestinian people, reports FiveThirtyEight, compared with 56 per cent who have a favourable view of apartheid Israel. The data cited in the website's new report covers the seismic shift that has taken place in the US since 2014.\n\nMore democrats than ever support the Palestinian cause, and that is something that is dividing the party, said the report published in ABC News' sister site, which focuses on opinion poll analysis. It has published details of the shift in support for Palestine and offered explanations for why increasing numbers of people are abandoning Israel. Highlighting the dramatic shift over the past two decades it cited a 2001 Gallup poll when only 16 per cent of Americans sympathised more with the Palestinians, while 51 percent sympathised more with the Israelis.\n\nTwo decades later, though, the landscape has changed. The percentage of Americans with more sympathy toward the Palestinians is now 26 per cent. That support has more than doubled among Democrats, said the report. Today, 38 per cent of Democrats express more sympathy for the Palestinians.\n\nRead: MEMO in conversation with Prof. Norman Finkelstein\n\nDoubt and distrust over the Israeli narrative and the rise in social media are said to be the main reasons for the shift towards greater solidarity with Palestine. Social media has changed how wars and conflicts are witnessed around the world, especially among young people. Israel's military offensive against Gaza in 2014 is seen as a watershed movement in the shift. The onslaught left 2,251 Palestinians dead, with more than 11,000 wounded.\n\nSuch casualty statistics affected the way that the world saw the conflict, and the \"self-defence\" narrative pushed by Israel to justify the attack wasn't accepted universally outside Israel, according to Dov Waxman, director of the Y&S Nazarian Centre for Israel Studies at UCLA.\n\n\"It's really the last decade, during which so many events and shifts and factors have changed thoughts in the public domain,\" Waxman is reported as saying. It was explained that what happened in 2014 was the first large-scale escalation in the age of widespread social media. In the years since, researchers have pointed to the ways in which social media has reframed how the international community observes war in real time, whether over the past decade with the Palestinians or this year with the Ukrainians.\n\nFor many people, 2014 was the first time that they were exposed to and had access to first-hand accounts from Palestinians. These accounts challenged or at least contextualised the details reported by the mainstream media.\n\nOther factors include the rise of Black Lives Matter and social justice groups in general. Their campaign against structural racism has exposed the decades long suffering of Palestinians under an apartheid regime.\n\nA third reason mentioned in the report is that an increasing number of Democrats and liberals are realising that their values are inconsistent with the values of the apartheid state of Israel. \"In the past, supporting Israel was seen as aligned with or consistent with liberal values,\" explained Waxman. \"And, increasingly, it's seen as contradicting liberal beliefs and values.\"\n\nFormer US President Donald Trump's close alliance with Israel's then Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his controversial decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital also drove the notion of unconditional support for Israel further to the right of American politics.",
    "Israeli forces accused of killing ‘defenceless Palestinian’ man": "Israeli forces say the Palestinian man ‘attempted ramming attack’, but the Palestinian foreign ministry says it was a ‘traffic accident’.\n\nIsraeli forces have shot dead a Palestinian in the occupied West Bank after what the army called an “attempted ramming attack”, but the Palestinian authorities have accused Israeli police of intentionally killing the man, identified as Muhammad Ali Hussein Awad.\n\n“The Israeli police deliberately shot Awad, with the aim of killing him, after his vehicle collided with a police vehicle in a traffic accident,” the Palestinian foreign ministry said on Saturday.\n\nThe 36-year-old from the West Bank town of Beit Ijza, near Jerusalem, was a “defenceless Palestinian” who was not “posing any danger”, the ministry added.\n\nThe Israeli military said a soldier and a police officer saw a vehicle speeding up as it headed straight at them in an apparent attempt to ram into them. The soldier then shot towards the vehicle, it said, and the suspect was “neutralised”.\n\nThe victim’s family also contested the Israeli army’s version of the incident, saying the 36-year-old likely lost control of the car, according to Reuters.\n\nAl Jazeera could not immediately verify rival accounts of the incident.\n\nThe father of three worked as a teacher in a school in Bir Nabala village, northwest of occupied East Jerusalem, according to the Palestinian news agency WAFA.\n\nHis cousin, Ramadan, told WAFA that the Israeli forces opened fire rather than assisting him after the crash.\n\nThey have faced criticism over their frequent use of lethal force, including in the killing of Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh in Jenin in May.\n\nIsrael has been on high alert in advance of the Jewish holiday season, beginning on Sunday evening with Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year.\n\nCar-ramming incidents and other attacks by Palestinians on Israeli military vehicles at checkpoints have regularly taken place in recent years in the West Bank, which Israel occupied after the Six Day War of 1967.\n\nThe northern West Bank – notably Jenin and Nablus – has seen near-daily Israeli military operations since March.\n\nIsrael has launched hundreds of raids in the area in pursuit of individuals it accuses of involvement in deadly attacks targeting Israelis.\n\nThese raids have sparked clashes that have killed dozens of Palestinians and inflamed tensions across Israel and the occupied territories.",

General Assembly on Tuesday, thawing a 14-year chill and heralding hopes of collaboration fueled by the possibility of exporting natural gas to an energy-desperate Europe. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight Lapid’s office said that Tuesday’s meeting in New York was the first face-to-face encounter between leaders of the two countries since 2008 and that they discussed “economic and energy cooperation.”\n\nA month ago, Israel and Turkey announced a full restoration of diplomatic ties and exchange of ambassadors, a development that Lapid described as “an important asset for regional stability and very important economic news for the citizens of Israel.”\n\nTurkey, the first Muslim country to recognize Israel as a state and, before 2008, one of its strongest allies in the region, has over the past decade and a half intensely challenged Israel over its treatment of Palestinians. Erdogan has repeatedly made parallels between his own democratically elected Islamist party and Hamas, which rules the blockaded Gaza Strip, calling it “a resistance movement that defends the Palestinian homeland against an occupying power.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTurkey’s increasing criticism of Israeli treatment of Palestinians caused diplomatic tumult. In 2010, Ankara recalled its ambassador after an Israeli naval commando raid on a Gaza-bound aid flotilla resulted in the deaths of 10 Turkish activists. Tensions again boiled over in 2018, following bloody protests on the Gaza border provoked by President Donald Trump’s decision to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, and Turkey and Israel recalled their respective ambassadors.\n\nBut the tide has turned in recent months, as Israel, exploiting its recently discovered offshore natural gas sites, seeks to export billions of cubic meters to a European market seeking to wean itself from Russian supplies.\n\nIsraeli gas is part of a global, patchwork energy strategy being forged by European leaders looking ahead to a potentially difficult winter. Russia’s pipeline gas today makes up 9 percent of all imported gas to the European Union, compared with 40 percent before Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs part of this effort, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen signed a deal with Israeli and Egyptian leaders in June that will enable Israel to pipe natural gas to Europe via Egyptian liquefaction facilities.\n\nAs a result of the diplomatic strain, Ankara abandoned talks years ago to build an underwater natural gas pipeline linking Israel to Europe via Turkey.\n\nBut Erdogan called a visit to Turkey in March by Israeli President Isaac Herzog, the first in over a decade, “an opportunity to revive the cooperation on the topic of energy that began before.”\n\nAt his speech before the General Assembly on Tuesday, Erdogan highlighted energy as a priority in Turkey’s foreign policy.\n\n“Turkey has always looked at energy as a field of cooperation rather than competition,” he said. “In addition to our own needs, we have implemented many projects that support regional and global energy security.”\n\nZeynep Karatas in Istanbul contributed to this report.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article",

    "Gantz: Agreement With Palestinians Not Likely in Foreseeable Future": "Defense Minister Benny Gantz said on Saturday that there is no possibility of reaching an agreement with the Palestinians in the foreseeable future.\n\nIn an interview with Kan TV in which he related to Prime Minister Yair Lapid’s speech at the UN General Assembly, in which Lapid expressed his support for a two-state solution, Gantz said that “this was a good and important speech. We agree on everything regarding Israel’s position in the Middle East and on the problem of Iran.\n\nWith regard to the Palestinians, we believe we should reach an accord, but one has to confront reality with clear eyes, and to my understanding there is no way of reaching an agreement in the foreseeable future.” He also clarified that he opposes the idea of one binational state. “We are for two separate entities, but not in a way that endangers Israel.”\n\nGantz did not dismiss the possibility of forming a government led by him, with Likud but without Netanyahu. Such a government would be broad, he said, and not rely on the extremes.”\n\nHowever, he rejected the possibility of a coalition with Balad or Hadash-Ta’al. “Balad for me is anti-Israeli. The [now defunct] Joint List has an agenda I can’t live with,” he said. Referring to United Arab List leader Mansour Abbas, he said that the latter had done some good things, and that he’d be happy to collaborate with him.\n\nIn an interview with TV Channel 12, Gantz said that he would not sit in a government led by Benjamin Netanyahu under any scenario. Gantz said that “Netanyahu has grievously damaged the state-oriented approach in Israel, which is why there is no possibility that I, with a state-oriented view, could sit with him. It’s over, it won’t happen.”",

    "'Our Conflict With Iran Is Unparalleled', Say Israel's Elite Cyber Unit Commanders": "Unit 8200, once cautiously dubbed “the central intelligence collection unit of the Intelligence Corps,” is today a huge information enterprise. The number of soldiers serving there, both enlisted and career soldiers, is larger than the workforce of the Mossad or the Shin Bet security service. And counting all the unit’s active reservists, its manpower outnumbers both of those agencies put together.\n\nThe continual rise in the size of Unit 8200 over the past two decades reflects three intertwined processes, in Israel and abroad. First, intelligence collected by technology has overtaken, in extent and importance, human intelligence, which relies on agents. Second, when it comes to technology, signals intelligence, which relies on bugging and listening, has begun to cede its importance in recent years to cyberintelligence, which relies on hacking computer systems. And third, within cyberoperations itself, alongside growing intelligence collection abilities, offensive capabilities are also improving – the ability to disrupt the enemy’s systems and thus affect an enemy country or organization's ability to function.\n\nThe three processes have added an offensive dimension to the work of units like 8200 and its counterparts abroad for the first time. In Israel, this is closely connected to another development: Iran as Israel’s prime enemy. Iran and Israel are battling each other despite not sharing a border, and cyber operatives, particularly those from 8200, have become a central component of the campaign.\n\nPhysically, the soldiers from 8200 are stationed mainly in central Israel – although they are slated to move to the Negev toward the end of the decade – but their work takes place abroad. This is a relatively new component in war, and it recalls the difference between pilots and drone operators. These assailants make essential contributions, but they themselves do not see combat and their offensives do not put them at risk.\n\nA similar process is also taking place in defense. The increased reliance of the state, and of society in general, on digital systems has exposed it to more hacking, most of which has been criminal, rather than government-sponsored. The defensive efforts are led by the National Cyber Directorate, but the IDF also plays a central role, both because of its personnel's skills and because it needs to protect its own systems, which, if damaged, could shut them down during combat. Consequently, the military's Joint Cyber Defense Directorate has grown considerably and taken on skilled soldiers.\n\nOver more than a decade, the IDF deliberated over the structure of its cyber realm. For the time being, plans have been frozen to establish a cybercommand to oversee all of its units and capabilities. It decided to make do with a basic division of labor, and it serves the army’s purposes reasonably well in the meantime. Military Intelligence, through Unit 8200, coordinates the collection of cyberintelligence and offensive action; the C4I and Cyber Defense Directorate is responsible for the IDF's systems, and their defense by means of the Joint Cyber Defense Directorate.\n\nA good many of these entities' operations – and particularly the technical details – are still classified. Nevertheless, along with the high-tech's transformation into the engine of Israel's economy, the status of IDF's cyber personnel has soared. Many parents now dream that their children will be drafted to 8200: a prestigious unit promotes security – and also has clear economic potential down the road.\n\nThese changes require a bit more openness on the part of these soldiers, in order to talk to the Israeli public, to convey messages to enemy powers and sometimes to correspond with global names in cybertechnology – first and foremost American tech giants. This is apparently what inspired the army’s decision to allow Haaretz access to two of its senior officers in the field. Both are now concluding their long military careers.\n\nCol. Uri Stav is the deputy commander of Unit 8200’s offensive unit; Col. Omer Grossman’s last posting was as commander of the \"cyber advantage center,” and in normal language – head of the defense department in the C4I and Cyber Defense Directorate. This is a relatively rare opportunity to hear directly from people involved in critical areas, but they are still cautious. After years of strict discipline in cybersecurity, Stav, for example, has trouble using the actual words “cyber offensive,” and usually chooses euphemisms.\n\nUnlike most enlisted soldiers, Stav, 43, came to the unit after getting his academic degree, and later earned his doctorate in computer science at Tel Aviv University. In recent years he has focused on signals intelligence and cyphers. “I worked much more with literature than with intelligence material. I didn’t think I would continue beyond my initial contract in the career army,\" he says, adding that he considered entering academia full time. \"But I discovered that I enjoy commanding and instructing. I wanted to do big things, to have an impact on people here.”\n\nEven though Stav made this decision while high-tech companies were trying to entice personnel to enter the private sector, most of the courting was indirect, he said. \"My decision to stay, at any point, was the right choice for me among good possibilities.”\n\nStav describes commanding the unit as the “crowning glory of the experience here. These are very high-quality people – in character, values and talent. But their motivation is complex. The challenge in commanding here is unique. You often expect them to invent things, to solve problems that other people don’t know how to solve. You can’t force someone to find a solution. They have to feel connected to the mission, with a high degree of trust in their commanders.”\n\nIs this talent management? Do you have to act like a soccer coach, with Messi and Neymar on your team?\n\n“It’s definitely talent management, but not of divas. You're like a coach that has to spur them on, to see how the goal remains clear and significant to them all the time. There are thousands of people here. Out of those, a few dozen or hundreds are unique in their skillsets. They give the X factor to the unit, more power and quality. We try very hard to maintain them and keep them. Anyone who chooses to stay here, in the career army, makes concessions. We want to make sure the attitude toward them is healthy and respectful. On the other hand, we'll pass up soldiers who make unsuitable demands.”\n\nThe ability to collect cyber- or signals intelligence means gravely invading the privacy of people on the enemy side, many of whom are not directly involved in threats to security. In 2014, dozens of former members of Unit 8200 wrote an open letter to then-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and top military officials, saying they would refuse to do reserve service because of this \"political persecution.\"\n\nStav says that \"there are tensions that we encounter in these worlds. We deal with this every day. Some of the signatories to the letter were previously under my command. I don’t feel that these are complex dilemmas. In the end, every action we take has a good and specific reason. Even if you collect a lot of data and some of it is sensitive, you don’t use it without anyone knowing. We know how to extract what we need using artificial intelligence; somebody’s dental x-rays, on the other hand, are of no interest to us.”\n\nHe adds: “Some of the reasons that 8200 is more open – including this interview – have to do with the code of ethics, our rules and norms. We are very proud of them. We have a role at this time that involves shaping these norms, in the country and in global conduct. It is also has to do with our dialogue with partners overseas. Cyberdefense is a bit different from classic military areas; there are also tech giants. They are big players that influence the rules of the game.”\n\nOpen gallery view Col. Uri Stav, deputy commander of Unit 8200’s offensive unit. Credit: Moti Milrod\n\nStav alludes to the upheaval these companies experienced after their close collaboration with the American security establishment was revealed, following Edward Snowden's leaking of secrets from the National Security Agency – Unit 8200's American counterpart. The unit has working relations with major tech companies, and at the same time closely cooperates with intelligence units and counterparts in the West. “We are a lot better known than we were in the past,” Stav adds. “We have dialogues with others in the industry. Globally too, we want to take an active part in shaping the reality and organization of the world. You can’t do that behind the scenes alone.”\n\nThat sounds like an ambitious goal. Why is that your role?\n\n“Part of operational ability is connected to how the area looks – it's not just enemies that operate in it. What is possible, what’s allowed, what’s not? We’ll lose a lot if we sit on the sidelines and don’t have an impact on it. We also want to contribute to standards in this realm: we must demonstrate proportionality, pinpointed activity, responsibility.\n\n\"Our conflict with Iran has no parallel in the cyber-realm anywhere in the world. Iran attacks us and talks about destroying us. This relates to actions they have carried out that we have identified, such as attempts to sabotage the water system, to the point of poisoning it. These are unparalleled actions; other countries usually show restraint, a degree of responsibility. But in the face of such action, how do you respond? How do you neutralize the threat? How do you formulate a response to this equation that will protect civilians? This a unique case.”\n\nThe offensive side of the cyber-realm, Stav says “will remain almost totally secret. It gives us an advantage in the direct campaign against Iran, in a place where geography has no meaning. One of the challenges is that Iran supports organizations that are on our borders, but are physically distant from us. When it comes to cyberwarfare, distance doesn’t exist.\"\n\nAnother reason the state is involved in cyberoffensives, he says, is that \"this is the place where we are really in thepremiere league of countries in the world, in skills, quality, power – but of course, not in quantity. We don’t compete with the world powers in terms of human resources.\n\n\"I’ll say cautiously that when it comes to cyber, both defensive and non-defensive, we possess the most advanced capabilities in the world. It’s our responsibility to take advantage of this vis-à-vis Iran. There’s simply an opportunity here. The awareness of this at a senior level, the backing from the military command level and the politicians, is very strong,” Stav says. “We have the complex role of revealing and explaining the sensitivity and risks, and to put on the table options and the opportunities that they may not know to ask us for.”\n\nStav emphasizes that not \"all means are legitimate in the name of security,” referring to NSO, the Israeli cyberoffensive company that found itself blacklisted by the Biden administration after its dubious activities were exposed worldwide. In retrospect, it turned out that its deals were made with the encouragement of the Israeli government and security establishment, and that during the term of former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the policy of “offensive cyber-diplomacy” was part of creating closer ties with some countries in the Middle East and the developing world.\n\nAccording to Stav, “one of the problems with the use of technology is that, when a company creates a method or a system and it’s exposed, you can’t distinguish among its clients and their objectives. When you use this, you lose your ability to control which actions you are associated with. We chose not to buy anything from NSO, because we realized that we want to be in full control of the technology’s distribution and its objectives.”\n\nHe confirms that “There are very strong technologies out there and we decided not to go with some of them out of choice, because first and foremost, we maintain proportionality and full control of the technology. The Israeli [intelligence] community – the Defense Ministry, us, the civilian companies – have come a long way in recent years. We understand how the market should conduct itself. I believe that these standards will also be adopted by the companies outside.\"\n\nAs for the change the unit has undergone, Stav says: “We have become much more proactive in obtaining information. This has changed us a great deal. It is related to the abundance of data that exists today from a great many sensors, and the ability to reach it by means of more extensive insights. I experienced this myself in my 20-something years here – the opportunities that are created through connectivity, internet connectivity, greater numbers of computers and cellphones. That creates many new technologies that have to be understood and learned.\n\nOpen gallery view Col. Omer Grossman. Credit: IDF Spokesperson's Unit\n\n\"The biggest gift we have is the quality of the manpower that arrives every year. It’s precisely the lack of experience and rapid turnover that help quick changes and quick responses to changes in the environment. They grow into the technology that’s changing all the time. They are less set in their ways, and very often change comes from the bottom-up.\n\n\"In my first assignment as head of a department, I commanded people who worked in a field that did not exist when I came to the unit five years before. Today, most of the unit changes its professional focus every 10 years,\" Stav says. “Hardly anyone here dealt with data science or machine learning 10 years ago. Many areas in the field of cyberdefense didn’t exist a decade ago. At that time, it was mostly the Shin Bet that dealt with it, and there were far fewer threats.\n\n\"We are in the midst of a transformation. Some of the roles are changing. There will be a big change in translation that we’ll encounter in the next three or four years,” Stav says, hinting at machine translation. \"A fusion of a great many types of information is underway. A change was made in Military Intelligence three years ago, in the linkup of data systems and databases and the ability to create smart algorithms that examine all the sensors from different places. That allows us to generate more precise intelligence, and has thwarted quite a few attacks.”\n\nWithin 8200, a good deal of the commanders’ efforts is devoted to the quality of the unit's manpower over time. The commanders ascribe great importance to keeping Israel's compulsory draft law, without which, they fear, exceptionally talented young people will not desire to join the unit. If the law is overturned, Stav says, “in the course of a few years, we wouldn't be able to complete our missions. People would go straight into high-tech, and our quality would be seriously compromised. Our ability to be strong with a smaller group of people depends on the compulsory draft. We are based on the idea that graduates of computer, math and robotics Olympiads come to this unit or similar units in Military Intelligence every year.”\n\nThe unit is making a simultaneous push to increase its potential: learning programs in middle and high schools in the country's periphery, a cyber training program for combat soldiers at the end of their mandatory service and encouraging girls to choose scientific and technological programs in schools. Within the unit, Stav talks about \"a significant increase in female officers in the ranks of captain to lieutenant colonel, in core positions. We have increased from 5 percent to 25 percent, but this is still far from reaching the potential for women. This is a problem at the level of the state and the education system, and despite several attempts at change, it never took off.\"\n\nStav joined 8200 in the late 90s. At that point in the unit, he says, \"a professional challenge met developing technology and a unique DNA. The guys wanted to understand what could be done better.\" He compares their beginnings to the Palmach – the elite strike force of the pre-state Haganah militia: \"There was a lot of trial and error, mostly error, but in the end the experiment worked. The next potential is continued development in the worlds of data science, and this will require major changes in the unit in the future. If we stick to this and act effectively, proportionately and responsibly, it will be a large part of the country's strength in the coming decades.\"\n\nBelow the escalation threshold\n\nCol. Omer Grossman is the same age as Stav, and has performed his service at the same time on the other side of the IDF's technological space: in the Communications Corps, the Computing and Information Systems Center, and the Teleprocessing Corps, while at the same time on loan to other security organizations. Grossman was entrusted with cyber defense, from the early days of the Joint Cyber Defense Department, \"when we were just a department head, a driver, a clerk and me.\" He later established a defensive counterterror branch, \"like a Sayeret Matkal intervention team,\" he says, referring to the elite combat unit, which was called in to deal with emergencies.\n\nHis description of the challenges of cyberdefense seems to be a mirror image of what Stav illustrates from the attacking side. \"The uniqueness of cyberspace is the attacker's ability to deny it. You can work below the threshold of escalation, play with the firepower — and for you, as a defender, it is very difficult to give attribution, to say with certainty who attacked you.\"\n\nOpen gallery view Hillel Yaffe Hospital after the cyberattack, in 2021. The damage caused to the medical institution was estimated at 36 million shekels. Credit: Amir Levi\n\nPart of the difficulty stems from the lack of an international law for cyberwarfare. \"There are really no agreed norms, with the exception of the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime. You can suddenly encounter ransomware\" – a cyberattack used for extortion – that becomes significant, and can even have an effect on national resilience.\" In recent months, Grossman's people helped deal with the major cyberattack on the Hillel Yaffe Medical Center in Hadera. In the United States, he says, \"the Cyber Command has been given responsibility for dealing with cybercrime. They put it high on the list of national threats.\"\n\nWhen the war in Ukraine broke out, most experts estimated that Kyiv was expected to face serious cyber attacks by Moscow, as happened in the past in several of the wars led by the Putin regime. These predictions, like many others at the beginning of the war, did not come true. Grossman believes that still, \"when the guns are roaring, cyber has less of an effect. There is no point in lowering the electricity infrastructure in a city that has already been destroyed by shelling.\" Other senior officials in the IDF believe that the early help the Ukrainians received from Western cyber powers may have helped to contain the Russian attack. Grossman mentions \"the stand taken by companies and individuals in the West in favor of Ukraine. Elon Musk is operating a satellite infrastructure to help them.\"\n\nIsrael, he says, is vulnerable to cyber attacks \"precisely because we are technologically advanced. It is a democratic and digital country, so the attack surface against us is large. The digital wealth creates vulnerability.\" The cyber division thwarts dozens of attack attempts a year, some of which are directed against the IDF's computerized systems. This is the result of our small advantage, as well as the sense of urgency and the shared military and security background of most of those involved.\"\n\nThe vast majority of attacks are thwarted, says Grossman, \"but the working assumption is that there is no such thing as 100 percent success. When the line of defense has already been breached, the trick is to locate and draw conclusions quickly. Part of this is related to civil responsibility, such as wearing a seat belt in the car or wearing a mask during the COVID-19 pandemic. Simple steps like downloading updates to cell phones and having basic computer security reduce 99 percent of the risk. A citizen must understand that in 2022, his information on the internet is at risk. Cyber crimes are here to stay. The ransom industry is a lucrative economic business that generates a lot of money. The criminals estimate that in order to save lives, countries will pay. It can come to hundreds of thousands of dollars in one attack. Organized, international criminal organizations of all kinds are involved. It does not directly threaten the IDF, because most of the time our systemic capability is within a managed network and therefore less vulnerable. We are a little outside this jungle.\"\n\nIn 2021, the Cyber Defense Division received the Israel Security Award. Grossman says that \"the strategic equation in cyber is just now taking shape, unlike kinetic fire against Hezbollah or Hamas, where the rules of the game are known.\" The Iranian cyber threat preoccupies him, but he is not overly impressed by the capability Tehran has demonstrated so far.\n\n\"The enemy must never be underestimated, as a rule. But I can say with full confidence that the abilities on our side are infinitely higher. This is not the same league at all, not even the same sport. To date, there has been no functional damage to our systems as a result of attacks by Iran.\" The threat, he estimates, will increase in the coming years. \"This is part of all of us growing up. There is a new fighting dimension here.\" This dimension will sometimes also include Israeli responses outside the familiar terrain of cyberspace. \"Those who act against us through a keyboard should understand that there are consequences to their acctions, and not just in the world of cyber.\"",
    "Italy’s Meloni portrays herself as strong supporter of Israel, rejects fascist past": "Italy’s Giorgia Meloni, who is on track to become the country’s first far-right leader since Mussolini in World War II, has long tried to distance herself from her party’s fascist past and indicated she would be a strong supporter of Israel, even boasting of ties to the Likud party.\n\nMeloni’s Brothers of Italy came top in Sunday’s general elections, winning some 26 percent of the vote, and her right-wing coalition looks set to secure a majority in both houses of parliament.\n\nThere was no immediate reaction from Israel, with results coming as the country celebrated the Jewish New Year. But Israel has in the past sought to boycott far-right European parties that have come to power — as it did with Austria’s Freedom Party, which was founded by former Nazis.\n\nBrothers of Italy, which Meloni founded in 2012, is a political descendant of the Italian Social Movement (MSI), formed by supporters of fascist dictator Benito Mussolini after World War II. Soaring in popularity — up from just 4% four years ago — the party uses a symbol featuring a tri-colored flame that had been an icon of MSI.\n\nBrothers of Italy is headquartered at the same address, on Via della Scrofa in central Rome, where MSI set up its offices in 1946, the Guardian reported. In local elections in Rome last October, Mussolini’s granddaughter Rachelle, a Brothers of Italy member, won the highest number of votes for a council post.\n\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms\n\nBoth the US and EU on Monday indicated a willingness to work with Meloni, but cautioned against any possible human rights abuses in Italy.\n\nIn recent weeks and months, as her political star rose, Meloni has on several occasions expressed her support for Israel and sought to downplay the neo-fascist roots of her party.\n\n“We have handed fascism over to history for decades now, firmly condemning the loss of democracy, the outrageous anti-Jewish laws, and the tragedy of World War II,” she said in a recent interview with the Israel Hayom newspaper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe was answering a question about accusations that her party is neo-fascist, and stressed that while the claim was “ridiculous… coming from a desperate Left,” she did not want to “dodge the question, because I know how delicate it can be to (Israeli) readers.”\n\nThose comments echoed a video statement she put out in August disavowing Fascism.\n\n“For years, I have also had the honor of leading the European Conservative Party,” she said in the video, noting that this European Parliament grouping “shares values and experiences with the British Tories [the governing Conservative Party], the US Republicans and the Israeli Likud.”\n\nHer party, she added, “unambiguously condemns Nazism and communism” and “fiercely opposes any anti-democratic drift.” The Italian right, she also said, “consigned fascism to history decades ago, unambiguously condemning the suppression of democracy and ignominious anti-Jewish laws.”\n\nLast week, Meloni kicked out a party candidate who years ago posted a photo of her with the slogan “Italy Above All,” writing: “This reminds me of a great statesman from 70 years ago,” and elaborating that he was referring not to Mussolini but to a “German.”\n\nShe told the Hebrew daily in her interview 10 days ago she would head a “modern European and Western right-wing government” and reiterated her party’s affiliation with other mainstream conservative factions like Benjamin Netanyahu’s “Likud party, the British Tories and the American Republicans.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeloni spoke of previous visits to Israel, including to the Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum, which she described as “a conscience-shaking experience.”\n\n“Israel represents the only fully-fledged democracy in the broader Middle East, and we defend without any reservations its right to exist and live in security. I believe that the existence of the State of Israel is vital, and Fratelli d’Italia will make every effort to invest in greater cooperation between our countries,” she said.\n\nIn a 2020 video, Meloni also promised to defend Israel’s right to exist “without the shameful ambiguity of the Left.”\n\nShe told Israel Hayom she planned to return to Israel soon, hoping to focus on joint collaborations and strategies, starting with those for the supply of natural gas through the eastern Mediterranean Sea.\n\nHowever, she appeared to break with other right-wing leaders, including her likely coalition partner Matteo Salvini, indicating she would not likely move Italy’s embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n\n“This is a very sensitive issue, on which I think the next Italian government, like all those before it, will have to act in synergy with our partners in the European Union,” she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe EU has been adamantly opposed to such a move.\n\nMeloni also spoke out against growing antisemitism in Europe and sought to portray it as largely emanating from the left and Islamic immigrants to Europe.\n\n“I think that one of the most common manifestations of antisemitism today is anti-Israel propaganda, which Jews in Europe are most likely to encounter online. Jews in Europe are also subjected to the threat coming not only from far-left and far-right factions, but especially from radicalized Islamic immigrants who feed on resentment with regards to Israel,” she said.\n\n“Israel is and ought to continue to be a crucial ally of the European Union in the endeavor to eradicate this evil worldwide. We support efforts to increase young students’ understanding of Jewish history, religion, and culture. This will support the elimination of societal prejudices and the full acceptance of Jewish customs in Europe,” she said.",

However, Jerusalem’s increasingly close relationship with India remains a sore point for Pakistan, with the two neighboring states having fought periodic wars over contested territory in Kashmir.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a courtyard adjacent to a gymnasium once used as a rest stop for Jordan’s King Abdullah I during visits to Jerusalem, windows provided a rare glimpse from above of the northern courtyards of the Temple Mount, known to the Pakistanis by its Arabic name, the Haram Al-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary.\n\nThe competing historical narratives at play on the flashpoint esplanade and elsewhere would be a constant theme for the group to grapple with as it navigated through the city.\n\n‘One step at a time’\n\nThe trip was organized by Sharaka, an organization that emerged in the wake of the 2020 Abraham Accords — a series of normalization deals between Israel and several Arab nations — to promote peace and cooperation in the region, alongside the American Muslim and Multifaith Women’s Empowerment Council.\n\nFor Ashraf, joining the delegation was a logical step after decades spent promoting interfaith dialogue.\n\n“Since the Abraham Accords, I’ve sensed there is definitely an appetite [in Pakistan] for peace with Israel. There is a lot of opposition too — one step at a time. We started the conversation in 2005 when I was a member of the government’s cabinet.”\n\nFollowing the signing of the accords, an adviser to then-prime minister Imran Khan reportedly visited Israel to convey Islamabad’s desire for a closer relationship between the two countries. Officials in Pakistan rejected the claims and the visit was never independently verified.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the delegation ambled out of the tranquil school grounds and back into the chaotic alleyways of the Old City, Ashraf, as if thinking aloud, concluded: “Israel can mainstream the Palestinian youth, to reduce hatred and violence, giving them the same education and opportunities. That’s how you change thinking and society at a young age — not when you have nothing.”\n\nThe Pakistani delegation is following in the footsteps of a group of Bahraini and UAE nationals that visited the Jewish state with Sharaka nearly a year ago. That group, wearing traditional white Islamic robes common in the Gulf states, attracted far more media attention and public fanfare than their South Asian counterparts.\n\nThe lack of attention may have been by design. Whereas the autocratic governments of Bahrain and the UAE enthusiastically welcomed ties with Israel, anti-Israel sentiment runs deep in Pakistan’s messy political system.\n\nLast year, Pakistani journalist Ahmed Quraishi was fired from his position after visiting Israel. Last week, few delegates clamored for the opportunity to speak on the record.\n\nAshraf, though, was open, perhaps due to his high profile and US citizenship. He said that the Quraishi incident was part of the reason for his visit.\n\n“I said the only way I will go [to Israel] is if it’s public, not in the closet. Let’s make peace go forward. If this is to lead to anything in our lifetime, or the next lifetime, it has to be on record and some people just have to bite the bullet.”\n\n‘Wonder of the world’\n\nDescending the steps toward the Western Wall plaza, the group stopped to watch darkness descend upon the city as the Dome of the Rock lit up, the golden jewel in Jerusalem’s crown.\n\nLed by Dan Fefermen, global affairs director at Sharaka, along with a quintessentially Israeli tour guide in loose jeans and a patterned shirt, the delegation entered the Western Wall Tunnels complex, marveling at the engineering genius and religious significance of King Herod’s Temple walls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe dark, damp rooms they entered, which lay undisturbed until their rediscovery a decade ago, became the scene of a bizarre interfaith dialogue: the Muslim Pakistani visitors compared notes from the Quran with the Israeli tour guide’s biblical knowledge, confirming the existence of shared narratives and pointing out subtle differences.\n\nThe tunnels themselves have been a flashpoint in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In 1996, excavations under the Muslim quarter of the Old City, authorized by then-prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, sparked three days of rioting across the West Bank and Gaza that would take the lives of 25 IDF soldiers and over 100 Palestinians.\n\nWhile the highly publicized peace agreements between Israel and the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco have grabbed global attention, subtle underground conversations continue with other powerful Islamic countries — Pakistan, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and others.\n\nAs the tunnel conversation petered out and the group headed for the Western Wall plaza’s exit, one delegate, as if making a public proclamation, said, “The wonder of the world,” as he watched the masses of swaying Jewish worshipers at the foot of the wall, the Temple Mount with the Dome of the Rock’s golden dome above. All nodded their heads in agreement.",
    "Ukraine Asked Israel For Intel On Iran’s Role In Russian Invasion": "Ukraine has reportedly asked Israel to share intelligence on Tehran’s support for the Russian military in the war, as it downgraded diplomatic ties with the Iran for supplying drones.\n\nAxios cited senior Israeli officials as saying that Israel's deputy director general for Eurasia Simona Halperin visited Kyiv with the Israeli ambassador on September 7 to establish a “dialogue channel” with Ukraine about Middle East issues in order to share information and intelligence and coordinate positions.\n\nAccording to the unnamed officials, the Israelis held a meeting with Maksym Subkh, Ukraine's special representative for the Middle East, in which he stressed that Ukraine is opposed to the lifting of sanctions on Iran if a nuclear deal is signed, saying it will enable greater military cooperation between Tehran and Moscow.\n\nSubkh also told the Israeli diplomats that Ukraine expects Israel to take a much clearer position regarding the Russian aggression and unequivocally support Ukraine, which Israel has avoided because of their own relations with Russia.\n\n\"The Israelis gave us some intelligence, but we need much more,\" a senior Ukrainian official confirmed, saying that Halperin asked Subkh for intelligence on Iranian involvement in the war.\n\nCalling it \"a collaboration with evil,\" President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Saturday that at least eight Iranian-made unmanned aerial (UAVs) vehicles had been shot down so far in the conflict.\n\nUS National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan warned in mid-July that Russia was preparing to acquire military drones from Iran. Later reports indicated a Russian delegation visiting Iran and assessing the potential of Iranian drones in its war in Ukraine.",
    "Thirty Palestinian prisoners held in Israel launch hunger strike": "The group is being held under administrative detention, an Israeli policy that imprisons them without charge or trial.\n\nThirty Palestinian political prisoners being held in Israeli jails have begun an open-ended hunger strike to protest their administrative detention – a policy that means they are being held without charge or trial.\n\nIsraeli authorities have been using this obscure legal procedure for more than half a century, basing it on secret evidence, to imprison people without charge or trial for an indefinite amount of time.\n\nIsrael’s policy allows the detention of Palestinians for renewable intervals usually ranging between three and six months. Their imprisonment is based on undisclosed evidence that even a detainee’s lawyer is barred from viewing.\n\nIsrael claims the policy is necessary for security reasons and allows the government to hold “dangerous suspects” without revealing intelligence information.\n\nAmnesty International has described Israel’s administrative detention policy as a “cruel, unjust practice which helps maintain Israel’s system of apartheid against Palestinians.”\n\nThe 30 prisoners in question released a statement stating that their collective detention amounted to 200 years, according to Samidoun, the Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network.\n\n“Hundreds of years, during which the occupation prevented us from embracing our families or seeing our children as they were born or growing up. We never celebrated their birthdays, we did not accompany them on their first school day,” the statement said.\n\nThere are currently more than 743 Palestinian prisoners jailed under administrative detention orders out of a total of approximately 4,650 total Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, according to Addameer, a Palestinian prisoners’ rights group.\n\nThe last high-profile hunger strike that took place concerned Khalil Awawdeh, who went without food for 172 days. He ended his strike only after a written agreement was inked with Israeli authorities to set a limit for his administrative detention and for him to be released on October 2.\n\nAccording to the Palestinian Commission for Detainees and Former Detainees Affairs, 80 percent of administrative detainees have already spent time in detention.\n\nOn 21 September, former administrative detainee Hisham Abu Hawash, who was released in February 2022 after a lengthy hunger strike, was incarcerated once again by Israeli authorities.\n\nAyman al-Tabeesh and Adel Hreibat, two other former long-term hunger strikers who were released from administrative detention, have also been detained again.\n\nThe detainees going on hunger strike also include French-Palestinian lawyer and human rights activist Salah Hammouri, who is facing a revocation of his permanent residency status in Jerusalem based on a “breach of allegiance to the State of Israel”, according to Addameer.\n\nThe first time he was arrested was in 2001 for five months when he was only 16 years old. In 2004, he spent five months in jail under administrative detention. His third arrest was in 2005, when he was imprisoned for seven years. He has been in administrative detention since March 7, 2022.\n\nChairman of the Palestinian Commission for Detainees and Ex-Detainees Affairs, Qadri Abu Baker, told the WAFA new agency that a new group of 50 prisoners will join the hunger strike next Thursday.\n\nAccording to Addameer, Israeli authorities issued 5,728 administrative detention orders against Palestinians across the Palestinian territories between 2017-2021.\n\nIn 2021, there was a surge of 1,695 orders, which were tied to a campaign of mass arrests by Israeli authorities during weeks of violence in May and June.\n\n“For decades, Israel has intentionally used administrative detention to detain individuals, including prisoners of conscience held solely for exercising their rights to freedom of expression, assembly and association, to punish them for their views and activism,” Amnesty said.",
    "Likud Activist Punches Hero of Israel's 1973 War at anti-Netanyahu Protest": "Prominent Likud activist Rami Ben Yehuda was filmed Saturday striking a protester at a demonstration near Jerusalem against former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the fifth violent incident against anti-Netanyahu protesters in three weeks.\n\nFollowing the attack, the protesters and Ben Yehuda began brawling until they were separated by police officers. Both the Likud activist and the anti-Netanyahu protester who was attacked filed complaints with the police, and both will be investigated.\n\nIsraeli media outlets reported that the man who was punched by Ben Yehuda in the film is Colonel (ret.) Rami Matan, widely considered a hero of Israel's 1973 war for his action under fire during several battles against the Egyptian military in Sinai. As a young officer and tank commander, Matan helped rescue wounded soldiers from the battlefield and bring them to safety by loading them on his tank and driving with them on board.\n\nIn recent years, the retired IDF officer, who had previously stayed out of politics, began regularly attending protests against Netanyahu over his alleged corruption and attempts to weaken Israel's legal system in order to stop his criminal trial.\n\nMatan told the Ynet news website on Saturday that he won't be deterred by the violence against him, and he plans to continue protesting against Netanyahu's potential return to power. He added that Ben Yehuda called him a \"traitor\" before punching him.\n\nAn indictment against Rami Ben Yehuda for a separate attack on Balfour Street in Jerusalem is pending at the Jerusalem Magistrate's Court.\n\nLast week, several people were attacked in protests against Netanyahu's possible return as prime minister in two separate incidents. The attackers in both fled the scene. The police are investigating the cases.",
    "The Embassy of Israel in Korea Opens Pavilion in the Metaverse": "Quick take:\n\nThe metaverse pavilion was opened on the 60th anniversary of diplomatic ties between Israel and Korea.\n\nIt was opened to promote exchanges between the two countries.\n\nThe project was developed in collaboration with Korean company, VRillAR.\n\nThe Embassy of Israel in Korea opened a virtual pavilion in the metaverse on Sep 20, the 60th anniversary of diplomatic ties between Israel and Korea. This makes the Israeli embassy in Korea the first diplomatic entity to make a presence in the virtual world.\n\nThe purpose of the Israel-Korea metaverse is to provide more information about Israel and to promote exchanges between the country and Korea.\n\n“The Israel-Korea Metaverse is a truly unique platform for sharing a virtual reality immersive experience, the history of Israel-Korea relations and also for carrying out all kinds of interesting interactions between Israelis and Koreans. Even though they are 8,000 kilometers apart, yet in the metaverse, they are right next to each other,” Israeli ambassador to Korea Akiva Tor said during a launching event at a hotel in Seoul, Sep 20.\n\nDeveloped by the Israeli embassy in collaboration with Korean virtual reality company, VRillAR, the pavilion features an exterior inspired by the Shrine of the Book in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.\n\nUpon entering the pavilion, visitors will be welcomed by a virtual rendition of German-born Jewish theoretical physicist, Albert Einstein, who will give a brief introduction of the venue. The virtual Einstein is voiced by Michael Reiffenstuel, the German ambassador to Korea.\n\nThe first floor features a gallery that introduces 60 years of Korea-Israel relations, as well as an olive tree – Israel’s national tree – taking centerstage. There is a lounge on the second floor. The entire pavilion is available for various virtual events and activities and the Israeli ambassador hopes that there will be more visitors to the pavilion.\n\n“I’m quite sure that this is the way forward. It won’t be the only tool of public diplomacy and, of course, we will always want to bring real people to Korea and to hold in-person conferences and in-person cultural performances. But I think the embassy metaverse will become the essential standard just as websites became the essential standard about 20 years ago and SNS channels are now,” the ambassador said.\n\nThe Israeli embassy plans to bring continuous updates to the metaverse pavilion.\n\n“Our challenge as an embassy will be to make this innovative functionality popular in Korea and in Israel, for the people young at heart and open to a new experience of engagement,” Tor said. “I’m thinking of a metaverse with Hebrew and Korean language clubs, an Israel Film Festival, virtual meetings of the student clubs of Israel and Korea, a hangout for lovers of K-pop and the Hebrew Bible, a place for talk and debate about archaeology and the future of autonomous vehicles.”\n\nThose interested in visiting the Israel-Korea metaverse can download it on the Google Play Store or Apple App Store.\n\nStay up to date:",

    "Scripted Israel Celebrates Israeli Artists in Inaugural Hollywood Summit": "The rooftop terrace of Hollywood’s Neuehouse was abuzz Thursday night at a fete celebrating Scripted Israel, a social summit promoting Israeli television on the global stage. The inaugural four-day event, which ran Sept. 19-21, paired 28 Israeli delegates – selected by partners at Jerusalem’s esteemed Sam Spiegal Series Lab and the Israeli Producers Association – with development and content executives in Hollywood, serving as a de facto workshop experience for TV writers and producers angling to make their splash Stateside.\n\nTchelet Semel, Director of Cultural Affairs, Consulate General of Israel, Los Angeles, and Daniel Susz, Director of Film & TV in North America, Israel Office of Cultural Affairs, Consulate General of Israel, were chief on-the-ground organizers of the summit.\n\nRepresentatives from NewFilmmakers Los Angeles, which produced the one-on-one sessions, along with members of the Israeli Foreign Ministry and prominent development execs at streamers, studios and talent agencies such as Netflix, Apple TV Plus, Sony Pictures Entertainment and Amazon Studios were on hand at the music-fueled, closing-night bash, where guests ranging from Sarah Idan, a musician-slash-2017 Miss Universe Iraq, to Danna Stern, global television executive and founder of Israeli broadcaster Yes Studios, rubbed elbows with Israeli media exec and TV producer Alon Shtruzman, who recently stepped down as CEO of Keshet after a decade-long run with the powerhouse company, and Yoni Paran, CEO of Paran Studios.\n\nHillel Newman, Consul General of Israel in Los Angeles, notes that “we conceived the idea for [Scripted Israel] about a year and a half ago, but it took about another year and a half to get it all together.”\n\n“The idea behind it was that, up until now, the success of writers and producers and artists in Israel has been on individual levels,” Newman adds. “We decided to organize a platform where the top producers and upcoming stars of Israel – the content creators in Israel – come to Los Angeles. This is the way you foster relationships, build bridges of culture and work together.”\n\nDelegates included Shai Eines, co-CEO of Artza Productions (Oded Davidoff’s award-winning melodrama “The Beauty Queen of Jerusalem”); documentarians Tomer Heymann and Leigh Heyman, Heymann Brothers Films; TV scribe Omri Van Essen (“Fauda,” “Tehran”); Naomi Levari and Saar Yogev of Black Sheep Film Productions; and Talia Harris Ram, tv and film manager at the Jerusalem-based Deborah Harris Agency, which reps famed authors David Grossman and Sayed Kashua.\n\n“We currently hold 30 options [of intellectual property] with companies all over, including the United States, France, Germany and Israel,” says Harris Ram. “There are projects that are more suitable for the U.S. market, projecte that are more suitable for the European, Latin American and Africa markets. We’re really open to finding something for everyone.”\n\nThanks to hit series such as “Homeland,” developed from the original Israeli format, and “Fauda,” created by Lior Raz and Avi Issacharoff, Israel’s standing in scripted television popularity continues to soar; per analytics research company Omdia, Israel ranks second, after the U.K., in terms of scripted drama formats sold to the U.S. market.\n\nTo that end, the Scripted Israel delegates shared one collective goal: to amplify their artistic projects amongst American and global audiences.\n\n“We received such a warm welcome from the American [entertainment] industry here in Hollywood,” says Yogev, who produced “Dismissed,” a darkly comic half-hour series created by Nir Berger and Atara Frish that revolves around delinquents in a unit of female Israeli soldiers.\n\nThe series kicks off its second season this October.\n\n“Coming to L.A. through Scripted Israel, we opened windows,” Yogev continues. “I’m not saying that tomorrow we’re going to sign the deal, but there is now an open track of communication. That’s the most important thing.”\n\nStern, who shepherded such series as “Fauda,” “As We See It” and “Your Honor” while at Yes, is optimistic that Scripted Israel will provide Israeli artists with the networking opportunities needed to leverage their creative star power.\n\n“People that attend Scripted Israel are going to come away with greater connections and a better understanding of how the U.S. market works,” she says. “People are here looking for how to navigate the system and find more opportunities to tell [Israel’s] stories, whether in the original Hebrew or other formats.”\n\nOthers in attendance at the Neuehouse soiree included Ari Ingel, director of Creative Community for Peace, a non-profit organization aimed at promoting the arts as a pathway to peace, actor-writer Noam Ash (“The Other Two”) and Hallel Silverman, a Tel Aviv-based content creator and activist.\n\nScripted Israel, notes Silverman, whose aunt is actor and comedian Sarah Silverman, not only delivers a well-deserved boon to Israeli artists on a professional level, but in terms of international relations as well.\n\n“The beauty is that the stories painted in film, television and music reflect that of its society – and that opens us [up] to the ability to understand each other better,” she says.\n\nBaghdad-born Idan, who worked as a linguist for the United States military before making a name for herself on the pageantry circuit and becoming a peace activist-slash-veritable pin-up star in Israel, believes that “the arts, more than anything, can bring people together.”\n\nScripted Israel, she proffers, is the perfect opportunity to bridge cultural divides.\n\n“The arts [are] the only language where you can connect through your experiences, whether it’s music or writing or acting,” says Idan. “You see, you feel, you hear. I believe the arts will bring people together more than politics.”\n\nThere were myriad moments over the course of Scripted Israel that Stern compares to “capturing lightning in a bottle,” contacts made between writers and producers that signaled the start of professional partnerships in the small screen arena.\n\n“In our business, sometimes things just come about in the strangest way,” says Stern. “I saw so many of these moments where somebody is saying, ‘I’m looking for this,’ and then there’s a producer and he’s looking for the exact same thing. You know, you don’t get these big deals in 72 hours. These things never happen overnight – it’s a slow burn. But what I saw this week at Scripted Israel was, to me, like little seedlings. And they are going to flower and blossom.”",

Some of them even spoke this week of a 90-95 percent chance that Lebanon and Israel will sign an agreement in the coming weeks. However, Hezbollah continues to issue threats to strike at Israel’s Karish gas platform. It seems that as long as an agreement hasn’t been signed, the danger has not passed.\n\nThere’s also probably no reason to be overly impressed by Israel’s firm promise to start drilling for gas irrespective of progress in the negotiations. The franchisee, British firm Energean, is unlikely to volunteer to take risks with the crisis unresolved.\n\nInterestingly, a deal could fundamentally change relations between the two countries, to Hezbollah’s chagrin. From the moment the Lebanese will have something to lose – their own drilling rig, which is expected to produce critical profits for its shattered economy – a kind of mutually assured balance of terror will be created between the sides. Neither Israel nor Lebanon will want to risk harming their neighbor’s platform, which would bring about similar damage to its side.\n\nOpen gallery view An Energean Floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) ship in the Karish field, an offshore gas field in the Mediterranean sea which is claimed by Israel and partly by Lebanon, this week. Credit: - - AFP\n\nThe circumstances in the West Bank are more severe. Shooting attacks on the roads have again become an almost daily phenomenon. This week, a West Bank Palestinian bludgeoned to death a Holon resident, 84-year-old Shlomit Ovadia, with an iron rod. The murderer committed suicide a few hours later in Tel Aviv.\n\nLike some of the so-called lone wolves – the perpetrators of the wave of attacks in 2015 – the murderer, Moussa Sarsour, from the village of Sarta, suffered from mental health issues. But like in those cases, there was probably a fusion of motives – personal and political. Otherwise, why did he not hang himself in his village, without taking the life of an elderly woman who had done him no harm?\n\nBe that as it may, it looks as though a critical mass of incidents could accumulate, as in the wave of attacks last March. The frequency of the incidents will compel the army to go on deploying massive forces in the West Bank, largely in the border areas where work has begun to repair the separation fence.\n\nOn holiday eves in particular, the army will have to reinforce its presence along West Bank roads to prevent terrorist attacks on traveling Israeli families. “I am less worried about a general escalation like in the second intifada, and more so that a few attacks will slip by us, amid all the warnings,” a senior officer told Haaretz. “The primary difficulty is thwarting all attempts in time.”\n\nThe army has in the West Bank 11 battalions more than before the present wave of attacks began in March, almost double the number of soldiers. The situation is also seriously harming combat training. The regular battalions, along with several reserve battalions, are engaged in grinding activity in different sectors, training very little this year. The damage will be long-term, involving a serious blow to professional knowhow and fitness. Even without further escalation, the regular army’s workload will increase in the coming period because the army refrained, deliberately and justly so, from calling up reservists in late August (the last days of children's summer camps) and will do so again in the fall holidays.\n\nAt the same time, impressive offensive activity is continuing in the so-called campaign between the wars, surging 70 percent in the past year, compared to the preceding year. Here, in routine periods, the army’s advantages come into play: precise intelligence, detailed planning and execution, unparalleled aerial capability. Thousands of soldiers and officers are engaged in this activity, mostly far from the public eye. But these achievements are unrelated to what is happening in the territories – and it’s from the West Bank that trouble could soon develop.\n\nOpen gallery view A Palestinian protester gestures as Israeli army soldiers stand guard during a demonstration against Israeli settlements, in Masafer Yatta, near Hebron, this week. Credit: MUSSA ISSA QAWASMA/ REUTERS\n\nThere’s a degree of melancholic irony in the following conclusion, too: Israel’s ongoing inability to terminate the undemocratic situation in the territories is liable to adversely affect Israeli democracy within the Green Line. Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu will not hesitate to exploit terrorist attacks and hitches with the Palestinians to nail down electoral victory, after which he intends to launch a judicial jihad to halt the criminal proceedings against him.\n\nLast week, this column mentioned the strategic warning that the head of the research division in Military Intelligence, Brig. Gen. Dror Shalom, issued in 2016, about a flare-up in the territories that could endanger the Palestinian Authority’s rule.\n\nIn an article in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth on Wednesday, two of Shalom’s former MI colleagues, Maj. Gen. Amos Gilad (who was Shalom’s commander) and Dr. Michael Milshtein, wrote about an additional danger that the present situation portends. In their view, even if the security escalation subsides, we must not ignore “the protracted, subterranean merging between Judea-and-Samaria and Israel in the civil and economic realms, which is liable to form a foundation for administrative and political fusion.”\n\nThe two are referring to the growing conflation of the Israeli economy and the Palestinian economy in the West Bank, in areas such as water, electricity, communications and transportation infrastructures. Although these developments help improve Palestinian quality of life, they also create a reality that is becoming inseparable and is nearing the point of no return on the road to the perilous vision of a single state.\n\nJust maybe, the political decision makers are not totally indifferent to the developments. After years-long Israeli abstinence, Prime Minister Yair Lapid, speaking in the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday, called for promoting the two-state solution once again.",

    "In first, wounded Ukrainian service members to be flown to Israel for treatment": "Twenty wounded Ukrainian service members will be treated in Israel for the first time, Israel’s envoy to Ukraine said, amid an intense push from Kyiv for support from Israel.\n\nIsrael’s Ambassador to Ukraine Michael Brodsky said Sunday that the first two wounded Ukrainians were set to arrive in Israel Sunday for treatment at Sheba Medical Center outside Tel Aviv.\n\n“Israel will receive for treatment 20 Ukrainian servicemen who were seriously wounded during the war,” Brodsky said. “The treatment includes prosthetics and rehabilitation.”\n\nIt was not known when the other 18 would arrive or if the mission could be expanded.\n\nA Foreign Ministry spokesperson confirmed that Ukrainians were being brought to Israel.\n\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms\n\nSheba ran a field hospital in western Ukraine, away from the front lines, for six weeks shortly after Russia invaded, mostly to treat civilians.\n\nIsrael for years provided medical treatment to Syrians who came to the Golan border during the civil war there, eventually setting up a military field hospital as part of what was described as a humanitarian effort.\n\nThe announcement that Ukrainians would be brought to Israel came after harsh criticism against Israel from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who said Friday he was “shocked” by Israel’s lack of defense aid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIsrael has provided Ukraine humanitarian aid and protective equipment, including helmets and flak jackets, but has held off on military supplies as Jerusalem seeks to preserve crucial ties with Moscow.\n\nIsrael was one of the few countries to have had warm ties with both warring sides at the start of the war, although the relationship with Moscow has soured in recent months.\n\nIsrael has increasingly sided with Kyiv, especially since Prime Minister Yair Lapid took office in July. His predecessor, Naftali Bennett, attempted to broker a deal between Ukraine and Russia.\n\nRussia controls the airspace over Syria, where Israel operates against Iran-linked forces including Lebanon’s Hezbollah terror group. Russia has largely turned a blind eye to the Israeli airstrikes.\n\nRussia is also home to a significant Jewish population, which appears to have become a bargaining chip, as Russia has threatened to shut down the Jewish Agency, which facilitates Jewish emigration to Israel.\n\nThousands of Ukrainians and Russians, mostly Jewish, have fled to Israel since the start of the war.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIsrael’s reluctance to assist Ukraine’s military has repeatedly drawn criticism from Zelensky and other Ukrainian leaders.\n\nOn Friday, Zelensky complained in an interview that Israel had given “nothing” to Ukraine to help it defend itself.\n\n“Israel gave us nothing. Nothing, zero,” Zelensky told France’s TV5Monde. “I understand they are in a difficult situation with Syria, with Russia.”\n\nUkraine has requested Israeli missile defense systems, such as Iron Dome, that could be used to fend off Russian airstrikes.\n\n“I understand they need to defend their land, but then I got information from my intelligence services that Israel provides [the air defenses] in other countries. They can sell, they can export, which is why I am shocked,” Zelensky said.\n\nIsrael keeps a lid on how many Iron Dome batteries it possesses and where they are deployed, but it has provided two of the systems to the US, which helped fund its development, and reports recently indicated a deal to sell batteries to Cyprus.\n\nThe vaunted Iron Dome intercepts short-range projectiles, such as the relatively crude rockets and mortars fired at Israel by Gaza terror groups. It’s unclear if it would be effective against the larger, more sophisticated Russian missiles pounding Ukrainian cities. The system also requires highly trained troops for its operation.\n\nEarlier this month, The Times of Israel’s Hebrew sister site Zman Yisrael reported that an Israeli defense contractor was supplying anti-drone systems to Ukraine’s military by way of Poland.",

    "Eight Wounded in Terror Attack in Central Israel, Assailant Shot Dead": "Eight people were lightly wounded Thursday evening when a Palestinian stabbed one and pepper sprayed the rest at an intersection near the central Israeli city of Modi'in, before being shot dead.\n\nThe assailant, armed with a knife and pepper spray, had approached cars at the intersection and attempted to open their doors and stab those inside.\n\nAn off-duty police officer who happened to be at the scene ultimately shot and killed the man, sustaining light injuries to his face in the struggle.\n\nOpen gallery view Mohammed Abu Jumaa\n\nThe assailant, identified as Mohammed Abu Jumaa, was a 23-year-old East Jerusalem resident from the At-Tur neighborhood, according to police.\n\nJumaa was previously arrested by police last October for allegedly throwing stones, and was held in detention for three days.\n\nIsrael's Magen David Adom rescue service reported that he opened the doors of two cars, and during a struggle with the passengers lightly wounded two men aged 40 and 23, and pepper sprayed the other passengers.\n\nParamedics treated eight victims in all: the two men who suffered light stab wounds, and the five who were sprayed with pepper spray. Three victims were taken to the hospital in fair condition.\n\nPolice are describing the incident as a terror attack. A senior police official told Haaretz that the attack was \"incited by online discourse,\" reflecting Israeli security forces' increasing preoccupation with rhetoric on Facebook, TikTok and messaging apps.

The suspect, 28-year-old Moussa Sarsour from the West Bank city of Qalqilya, worked at a nearby construction site and had a permit to work in Israel.\n\nAmid the manhunt for the perpetrator, Sarsour hanged himself in Tel Aviv. Israeli security services are considering the killing to be a terror attack, though no note or other indication of the assailant's intent has been found.",
    "As Saudi Arabia goes on defense investment spree, Israeli industry in a tight spot": "TEL AVIV — Israel is facing a dilemma. Saudi Arabia is investing heavily in its defense industry, eyeing lucrative deals directly with foreign firms or that involve international partnerships.\n\nBut Jerusalem, which recently normalized relations with some Gulf nations but not the Kingdom, is being left out, much to the chagrin of some Israeli defense firms that haven’t been able to get permission from the defense ministry to sell their wares.\n\n“The Saudis are very interested in Israeli systems,” a senior manager at one Israeli defense company told Breaking Defense on the condition of anonymity. “I’m sure there are ways to sell Israeli-made systems to Saudi Arabia even if some of the production is performed in [Saudi Arabia]. I know that the Saudis prefer some Israeli systems and this opportunity should not be missed.”\n\nThe consternation comes as Israel has seen cautious success with other Gulf nations, including the deal reported today to sell Rafael’s Spyder advanced air defenses to the United Arab Emirates. Israeli defense sources here said that would be a government-to-government deal, to be finalized soon.\n\nRELATED: For Israel and new Arab partners, $3B in defense business is just the beginning\n\nSaudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 plan includes localizing at least 50 percent of its defense spending, meant to stimulate indigenous production lines. But that offers opportunities for foreign firms to partner with Saudi firms, if they (and their governments) are comfortable with the arrangement. So far, the Israeli ministry of defense, which did not respond to a request for comment for this report, does not seem to be.\n\n“I can understand the defense industries who identify a huge potential market, but this is seeing the picture through a straw. Only the ministry of defense sees the whole picture where Israeli interests are on top,” said Amos Gilead, a former major general in the Israeli military who served as head of the military intelligence research division. “Deals with Arab countries have been made and will be made, but each case should be evaluated very thoroughly by the ministry.”\n\nA senior military official told Breaking Defense he thought “there are ways to ensure that selling defense systems and even transferring production chunks to Saudi Arabia will not harm the security of Israel.”\n\nIn September 2020 Israel, the UAE and Bahrain signed the Abraham Accords, which formally normalized relations between the countries. Within months, those nations expressed interest in Israeli defense systems, as Breaking Defense has reported.\n\nSuch was the case with Rafael’s Spyder air defense system, long eyed by the UAE to boost its defenses against UAV incursion. The Spyder is a family of systems, working from short to long range to “defend large areas, as well as maneuvering forces, against a wide spectrum of threats, such as attack aircraft, helicopters, bombers, cruise missiles, UAVs and stand-off weapons,” according to Rafael. The details of what exactly the UAE is expected to get in the deal weren’t immediately available.\n\nThe general interest in Israeli systems has been shared by Saudi Arabia, and Qatar for that matter, but those nations still face high geopolitical hurdles.\n\nIsrael isn’t the only country with which the Saudis are seeking to make deals as it attempts to continue to diversify its defense market. According to a report by the Oryx industry tracking site, Saudi Arabia has so far primarily purchased UCAVs from China. Since the mid-to-late 2010s, this has included the acquisition of a sizable number of Wing Loong I, Wing Loong II, and CH-4B aircraft. These added to a variety of reconnaissance UAVs produced in South Africa, Italy, and Germany that had been operating over Yemen since the start of the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in the nation in March 2015.\n\nRELATED: As UAV tech spreads, Gulf firms bet on upgrades with drone-to-sat links\n\nIn 2019, Saudi Arabia added to its arsenal of drones by purchasing the Lentatek Karayel-SU UCAV, which was developed in Turkey but would soon be produced in Saudi Arabia under the name Haboob.\n\nWhether Israeli systems are the next to join the expansion, that remains to be seen."
