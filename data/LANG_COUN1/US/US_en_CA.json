    "Canada to drop Covid border measures on Oct. 1": "The federal government will also end masking requirements on planes and trains.\n\nTrudeau was asked if he, like U.S. President Joe Biden, wants to signal an end to the pandemic.\n\n“Anyone who thinks the pandemic is over should visit our hospitals right now, where we still see the impact of people struggling with Covid-19,” Trudeau replied.\n\nThe prime minister said the decision to drop border restrictions was influenced by public health officials. “There is the sense that these border measures were no longer effective, or no longer justified,” he said.\n\nThe mandatory ArriveCAN app required individuals to upload vaccination credentials and other travel information before arriving in Canada. It was made mandatory under the Quarantine Act — measures set to expire Sept. 30.\n\nDuclos said the government reserves the right to reestablish certain measures should they be required against new variants of concern or other threats.\n\nHeadline glitches: ArriveCan was blamed for the congestion in Canada’s airports over the summer, though investigations revealed a myriad of problems at play. The tool misfired in June and July, sending automatic messages that directed some 10,000 Apple users into quarantine.\n\nIn defense of ArriveCAN: In mid-August, amidst calls to “scrap the app,” Transport Minister Omar Alghabra was called to a summer meeting of the House transport committee. He told MPs that compliance rates among international arrivals was 99.5 percent.\n\nIn fact, he warned MPs, “If we suspend ArriveCAN today, it will add significant complications to the congestion we have at our airports.”\n\nDuring the same meeting, Denis Vinette of the Travellers Branch at Canada Border Services Agency rejected accusations the app was behind border delays. “Without ArriveCAN, it would take a far greater time to process individuals than it currently takes,” he told MPs.\n\nWhat’s next: The House international trade committee has initiated a study of the impacts of the app on certain sectors of the Canadian economy. On Tuesday, MPs will hear from senior officials from Customs and Immigration Union and Frontier Duty Free Association.\n\nCanadian Deputy Health Minister Howard Njoo said Monday that vaccinations have changed “Canada’s scorecard.”\n\nStill, Trudeau urged Canadians to stay on top of their shots. “The more people get up to date in their shots, the more resilient we will be as a country to any future waves of Covid,” he said.",

    "Today’s crises highlight need for more multilateralism, stronger UN, says Canada’s Foreign Minister": "“These crises and the way we choose to respond to them are testing our shared commitment to the United Nations. That’s why our decisions matter now more than ever,” Canada’s Foreign Minister, Mélanie Joly, told the General Assembly’s annual high-level debate on Monday.\n\n‘More multilateralism, not less’\n\n“We have a choice – either we respect and defend the rules that we collectively have developed for generations and that have given us the longest period of peace in modern history or we accept that rules can be broken by the powerful, bringing us back to darker times of constant tensions and conflicts, with massive displacements, suffering and losses of human lives.\n\n“For Canada, the choice is clear: we’re convinced that we need more multilateralism, not less; we need more of the UN, not less; and we need a UN that is effective, efficient, relevant and accountable.”\n\nOn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Ms. Joly said the 193-member General Assembly has spoken clearly and with conviction.\n\n“Russia’s aggressions against Ukraine violate the UN Charter. It strikes at the heart of the commitment we all made in building this Organization from the dark tragedy of the Second World War. Rather than follow this Assembly’s decisions and a legally-binding order from the International Court of Justice, Russia had doubled down, including with a desperate effort to justify the unjustifiable.”\n\nNoting that while the world gathered in New York, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russia will conscript more young people to the war.\n\n“For Putin, this is a war to the death; for Ukraine, it is a war for life,” Ms. Joly stated.\n\nThe impacts of this “illegal” war are profoundly felt around the world, she continued. “We must address the global food security crisis and other consequences of the illegal invasion with imagination and determination.\n\n“And those who break the law must be met with the force of the law. A permanent seat on the Security Council not a license to kill nor to silence anyone, and it should never guarantee impunity.”\n\nNo country left behind’\n\nTurning to other major challenges, Ms. Joly highlighted the need to redouble efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, and to reforming the international financial institutions to enable them to adapt to today’s crises.\n\n“No country must be left behind,” she stressed, adding that Canada is working with partners for just and equitable reform of the international financial system, which is crucial for equity and for global peace and stability.\n\nCanada, she went on, is committed to ending the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as tackling HIV, tuberculosis and malaria. Last week, Prime Minister Trudeau committed to investing $1.2 billion in these efforts.;\n\n‘More urgency on climate’\n\nOn climate change, Ms. Joly said the world must act with the same urgency as during the COVID pandemic.\n\n“From the Arctic to the small island States, climate change is an existential threat, and we are feeling its effects every day,” she said. “Canada has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by 2030 and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, and we have a credible plan to do so.”\n\nThere are no simple solutions to the challenges the world is facing, she noted. “But it is clear that to isolate ourselves, to disregard the rule of law and to force people into silence runs counter to progress. And yet, certain countries are restricting civil liberties, violating human rights and conducting widespread surveillance of their population.\n\n“This trend towards authoritarianism is extremely worrying,” she stated, drawing particular attention to the Xinjiang region of China.\n\nOn human rights, no ‘defending the indefensible’\n\nLikewise, Canada is concerned about the repression of human rights seen in several countries. “We know that human rights are universal by nature. Therefore, we cannot hide behind the pretext of national sovereignty to violate them; there are limits to defending the indefensible.”\n\nMs. Joly also stressed the equality of women and girls as crucial for peace, justice and prosperity. Canada will repel increasing attacks on the rights and freedoms of women – from Afghanistan, where the Taliban are preventing women and girls from going to school, to Myanmar, where the women who are openly calling for a return to democracy are imprisoned by the military junta, tortured and subjected to “horrific” acts of sexual violence.\n\n“In Iran,” she continued, “women protesting the death of Mahsa Amini are met with arrests and bullets. We salute their courage and join them in sending a strong message that women’s rights are human rights.\n\n“Today, Prime Minister Trudeau announced that Canada will sanction those responsible, including Iran’s so-called morality police and its leadership.”",
    "No ‘Rah-Rah Canada’ for Amazon Studios: Streamer On the Hunt for Half-Hour Formats That Aren’t Uber-Canadian": "Amazon Studios wants to beef up its content library in Canada. And the quickest way to do that, according to Brent Haynes, the studio’s head of originals in Canada, is with half-hour formats.\n\n“With the exception of ‘Three Pines,’ we are doing half-hours and that’s because they help quickly build our library. But, that is also one of the gaps in our programming,” Haynes said recently during a Content Canada session in Toronto.\n\n“A lot of our other territories are doing one-hours and crime dramas, so we don’t need to repeat that,” he continued. “We are aware of what’s coming out around the world and we try to each make something that would help our other territories.”\n\nIn order to achieve that robust library, Haynes revealed the goal is to have anywhere from 5 to 10 shows in development at a time. “In our minds, every single one of those is going to go,” he said. “We’re not naïve to think they all will, because they fall apart and our needs change. But we’re finding because we love it, we want to make it.”\n\nSpecifically, Haynes is looking for local and unique stories that have a global appeal. What he’s not looking for are limited series or shows that are “hyper-localized” and inaccessible to mass audiences.\n\n“We want a unique Canadian perspective on everything,” he explained. “We’re not trying to tell stories that are rah-rah Canada, or are uber-Canadian, or check boxes that say, ‘This is what’s Canadian.’ But we do want something that we feel is unique to the territory,” he continued.\n\n“It has to hit a bar and that bar is really, really high. We know most Prime customers sign up for their free package delivery. But there’s still an expectation that they’re paying for this service. There has to be some sort of premium element to it,” said Haynes.\n\nThe executive added the general Amazon Studios model is to work backwards in terms of starting with data that models what its customers are looking for and then figuring out how to fill in those gaps.\n\n“We’re looking to make shows that Canadians will watch based on the research and the amount of data,” he said. “The strategy isn’t to just take great pitches, which we will, but we also want pitches in this area because we know this is what we need. The strategy is to find the best of the best.”\n\nThis past April, Amazon Studios Canada revealed a slate of Canadian original productions including the return of “The Kids in the Hall” and a companion docuseries, an adult animation series called “Gary and His Demons,” comedy drama series “The Sticky,” and the aforementioned “Three Pines” starring Alfred Molina and based on the book series by Louise Penny.\n\nChristina Wayne, who played a key role in the development of the Canadian originals strategy since joining the company in 2019, left her role as head of Canadian originals earlier this month to pursue other interests. Haynes joined the company as head of scripted series in May 2021 and was promoted this past August.\n\nHaynes was one of several executives on hand during the two-day Content Canada event, which also boasted Spotlight Stage sessions with Paramount+, Tubi Originals and Disney Plus. Netflix Canada took the stage for a session with director of Canadian series Danielle Woodrow and manager of Canadian series Tara Woodbury; however, it was closed to press.",

    "Opinion: Why are Chinese police operating in Canada, while our own government and security services apparently look the other way?": "Unit 1 & 2 at 220 Royal Crest CT, in Markham, Ont. This addredd home to a registered NGO is reportedly being used by Chinese police as a base of operations in the GTA.YADER GUZMAN/The Globe and Mail\n\nCharles Burton is a senior fellow at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute in Ottawa, and non-resident senior fellow of the European Values Center for Security Policy in Prague. He served as a diplomat at Canada’s embassy in Beijing.\n\nIn China, the high-profile TV drama In The Name Of The People has become a smash hit. In that show, Chinese agents enter the U.S. posing as businessmen so they can repatriate a factory manager who had fled abroad with huge ill-gotten wealth.\n\nBut a new study by the European non-governmental agency Safeguard Defenders suggests that there might be some truth to the fiction. According to the NGO, the Fuzhou Public Security Bureau has established more than 50 “overseas police service centres” in cities around the world – including three publicly documented ones in Toronto, home to Canada’s largest Chinese diaspora.\n\nThis is an outrage. Chinese police setting up offices in Canada, then “persuading” alleged criminals to return to the motherland to face “justice” – while our own government and security services apparently choose to look the other way – represents a gross violation of Canada’s national sovereignty, international law and the norms of diplomacy. China is extending the grip of its Orwellian police state into this country, with seemingly no worry about being confronted by our own national security agencies.\n\nThe RCMP and politicians of all stripes routinely condemn Chinese state harassment of people in Canada, but what action has been taken? There have been no arrests or any expulsion of any Chinese diplomats who might be co-ordinating this kind of thuggery.\n\nBeijing describes these global police outposts as administrative centres to help Chinese nationals renew driver’s licences and other domestic banalities back home. But the Safeguard Defenders study found that they also hunt down political dissidents, corrupt officials or rogue Chinese alleged criminals and urge them to return home.\n\nThe summary says some of these operatives are given cover by being formally attached to local Chinese Overseas Home Associations (which have themselves largely become co-opted by the Chinese Communist Party’s United Front Work operations and run out of China’s embassy and consulates).\n\nThis bold strategy is consistent with China’s propensity for routinely flouting international laws, including those that require any other country’s police wishing to gather evidence in Canada to work through the RCMP.\n\nIn the case of these “police service centres,” Safeguard Defenders reports that agents press their targets to return home, including by offering vague promises of leniency or even urging families back home to encourage them to do so. The officers have taken aim at these alleged (and unproven) criminals by seizing their families’ assets, denying children in China access to schools, and terminating family members’ employment, all in violation of due process.\n\nIn Canada, this has been a reality for years. In 2001, during refugee hearings in Vancouver for Lai Changxing – a businessman wanted by Beijing over accusations of corruption and smuggling – Chinese police admitted to entering Canada using fake documents, and even to spiriting in Mr. Lai’s brother in an attempt to convince him to return home. Canadian authorities effectively smiled benignly at this serious breach of criminal and immigration law; Mr. Lai was eventually deported back to China.\n\nCanada is becoming China’s chew toy. Consider Beijing’s alleged disinformation campaign which helped “unfriendly” Conservative MPs of Chinese ethnicity, including Kenny Chiu, lose their seats in the 2021 federal election.\n\nOttawa wants Canadian businesses to be able to tap into the world’s largest market. But the price of this access appears to be ignoring Beijing’s Canadian agenda, from military and industrial espionage to harassing Canadian Uyghurs, Tibetans, Falun Gong practitioners and ethnic Chinese and Taiwanese people who reject Beijing’s hectoring that they should be loyal to China instead of to Canada.\n\nDoes Canada have no security capabilities on the issue? Our police and security agencies must surely know what is going on, but for some reason prefer to simply curate their information rather than act on it. When asked by The Globe and Mail about the police service centres, an RCMP spokesperson said the force would not comment on “uncorroborated media reports or statements.” And most of the information we receive about China’s illegal and “grey zone” activities in Canada typically comes from the U.S. government and well-funded security and intelligence-focused think tanks in Australia and Europe.\n\nThe more we ignore reports of China’s growing presence in Canada – including its interference in our electoral process, its potential espionage in our universities and research institutes, and so on – the more emboldened and manipulative Chinese agents become. With no sign that it will be held accountable, China will only increase the size and threat of its operations, because it can.\n\nWith its seeming indifference toward China’s blatant contempt for our laws and security, Ottawa is playing an extremely dangerous game with Canada’s sovereignty.",
    "World Cup expectations for Canada? Dwayne De Rosario sets the record straight": "Could that all work for Les Rouges rather than against them, though? MLS legend Dwayne De Rosario, second in all-time goals (22) for Canada, sure thinks so as the country’s first World Cup appearance in 36 years rapidly approaches.\n\n“I'm interested to see how we adapt to playing against teams in a World Cup environment, something that we're very immature [with], something that we're very inexperienced in and how we handle our emotions and how we play,” De Rosario said in an Extratime 1-on-1 interview.\n\n“Now, that could benefit us though because when you're playing against Belgium, Morocco and Croatia, they're going in thinking 'Canada? Come on. We got this.' If we can sneak an early goal and be up and hold it, it could be pretty interesting.\"\n\nSetting expectations\n\nCroatia and Belgium finished second and third, respectively, at the 2018 World Cup in Russia. World superstars like Manchester City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne and Real Madrid midfielder Luka Modric are among their ranks, too. Morocco won’t be an easy opponent either, a perennial contender in the African Cup of Nations that counts Paris Saint-Germain defender Achraf Hakimi as their superstar.\n\nThey’re all “world-class teams,” as De Rosario noted. And they represent a step up in competition for head coach John Herdman’s team, which finished ahead of traditional regional leaders Mexico and the United States during Concacaf’s Octagonal qualifying pathway.\n\nSo, where should expectations be when Group F play unfolds from Nov. 23 to Dec. 1?\n\n“I'm going to be very honest: It's a tough group,” said the 2011 Landon Donovan MLS MVP. “If we scrape and get out of that group, that's a huge success. I'm just happy the fact we're there and we're having the conversation of Canada being in the World Cup first and foremost.",
    "Climate change means Atlantic Canada will see more frequent storms": "Hurricanes don’t usually maintain high wind speeds as they make their way toward Atlantic Canada. But ocean warming may be linked to the increasing intensity of storms like Fiona.\n\nAtlantic Canada has been left reeling from the impacts of one of the largest and most dangerous ocean storms to ever hit the region. Hurricane Fiona made landfall as a powerful post-tropical storm on Saturday along the eastern shore of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador, delivering heavy rainfall, damaging winds and massive waves.\n\nThe storm surge — a rise in seawater level — resulted in power outages, flooded roads, and in southwest Newfoundland, homes were washed away. The southwest coast of Newfoundland was hit particularly hard by extreme waves and storm surge, which were highest on the eastern side of the storm track.\n\nThe huge storm had a very low atmospheric pressure (931.6 mb) — which is the lowest ever recorded for a tropical storm that made landfall in Canada. Low pressure weather systems are associated with strong winds and heavy rains.\n\nOffshore, the wave heights exceeded eight to 10 metres on the Scotian Shelf and reached 17 metres at the Banqureau Banks wave buoy.\n\nWhile we wait for the NHC's official call, it looks like #Fiona has recently made landfall between Canso and Guysborough. With an unofficial recorded pressure at Hart Island of 931.6 mb, this makes Fiona the lowest pressured land falling storm on record in Canada. pic.twitter.com/TYo9G05sUz — ECCC Canadian Hurricane Centre (@ECCC_CHC) September 24, 2022\n\nPast storms\n\nHistorically, the Saxby Gale of 1869 was a massive storm that caused significant flooding in Nova Scotia. Other more recent storms, such as Hurricane Juan in 2003 and Hurricane Dorian in 2019 had big impacts, but they also weakened in storm intensity just before making landfall in Nova Scotia.\n\nHurricanes with the size and strength of Fiona do not usually maintain their high wind speeds this far north. This makes Hurricane Fiona a pivotal event in the Canadian coastal ocean, as it raises the question of when this will happen again.\n\nHow did Fiona get into Canadian water with such size and intensity? This is related to its heat source: the ocean. Ocean warming may be linked to the increasing intensity of storms making landfall and to the development of strong hurricanes.\n\nSo climate change leads to warmer ocean water at higher latitudes. A warmer future increases the probability that more intense storms will reach Canadian coasts.\n\nTypes of impact\n\nDepending on the size and strength of the hurricane, where it makes landfall and the shape of the coast that it strikes, the impacts can be very different.\n\nIn addition to large waves and storm surges, hurricanes also bring heavy precipitation that floods the land surface and can affect coastal groundwater systems.\n\nThese storms drive strong currents that can erode sediments and change the shape and forms of coasts. They can also affect water quality by suspending and spreading contaminants in harbours.\n\nHurricanes the size of Fiona may not occur again soon — or, a similarly intense storm could strike Atlantic Canada again within the next few years. We are making progress with recent improvements to hurricane forecasting and real-time coastal modelling.\n\nBeing able to predict the size, frequency and impact of storms helps inform warnings, decisions, responses and policies. These predictions are essential for being ready to face the next big storm event when it happens.\n\n______________________________\n\nRyan P.

    "United States and Canada Joint Statement on Support for the Haiti Security Basket Fund": "The United States and Canada are pleased to contribute to the “Joint Programme for the Haitian National Police,” a multi-donor basket fund on security in Haiti, which is managed by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in coordination with the Haitian National Police (HNP), UN Integrated Office in Haiti (BINUH), and other stakeholders. Canada launched the fund with a donation of $10 million Canadian dollars, and today the United States announced a donation of $3 million U.S. dollars to complement ongoing U.S. security assistance activities. We also would like to commend the commitments made today by Japan, the EU, and Mexico. We hope today’s event will generate additional donations by international partners in the near future.\n\nThe security basket fund aims to increase the HNP’s capacity to improve security, conduct law enforcement activities, and address some of the persistent institutional weaknesses within the HNP. Through the fund, the UN and partner nations will assist the HNP to improve its administration/logistics, train police, and strengthen operational capacity to counter gang violence in Haiti.\n\nThe mounting insecurity should be addressed with urgency to help Haiti move towards stability and sustainable development. A holistic approach is needed to re-establish security, encompassing measures to strengthen the HNP and initiatives to successfully address the socioeconomic drivers of violence, as Haiti remains one of the poorest countries in the world, with significant structural impediments to sustainable development.\n\nCanada and the United States commend the international community for mobilizing more than $294 million in new commitments since December 2021 to support Haiti’s most pressing needs. In these very challenging times for the Haitian people, we are convinced that international partners should redouble our efforts to help the Government of Haiti ensure citizen security and improve conditions on the ground. We urge partner nations to contribute to the UN Basket Fund to restore peace and citizen security for the Haitian people. Together with the Haitian government, the United States and Canada affirm the importance of working together to support the restoration of security in Haiti in partnership with the international community.",

    "Canada Set Standard with Sixes Sweep at The World Games": "Canada Set Standard with Sixes Sweep at The World Games\n\nMon Sep 26 2022 | Kenny DeJohn | Fuel\n\nInternational The World Games 2022\n\nBrooklyn Walker-Welch and Dhane Smith won gold medals with Canada at The World Games in Birmingham, Ala.\n\n\n\nThis story appears in the September/October edition of USA Lacrosse Magazine. Join our momentum. A new discipline seemed all too familiar for the Canadian men’s and women’s Sixes teams. In the land of Southern barbecue and soul food, The World Games in Birmingham, Alabama, had a distinct North of the Border flavor. Armed with men and women well-versed in box lacrosse, Canada utilized those skills masterfully to earn gold medals. The men ran roughshod throughout the rest of the field, picking apart the U.S. 23-9 in the gold medal game. The women topped the U.S. 14-12 to capture a gold medal of their own, riding a late save by Lauren Spence to glory. “Brodie Merrill, John Grant Jr., Jordan Hall and the rest of the coaching staff did a great job of preparing and picking this team,” said Dhane Smith, the NLL MVP who helped facilitate the high-octane men’s offense. “They didn’t pick individuals that could play just offense or just defense. They picked players that could play both ways.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysical, aggressive and playing with a little bit of a mean streak, Canada scored 117 goals over its five games in Birmingham. Instead of taking risky shots, they tried risky passes inside. Because shots that go out of bounds result in a turnover and not possession for the team closest to the ball, Canada focused its game in front of the cage.\n\nIt worked, and there wasn’t a defense at The World Games that could stop it.\n\nDana Dobbie, who also captured a silver medal at the World Lacrosse Women’s Championship in Towson, Maryland prior to hopping on a two-hour flight to Alabama, thinks it’s too simplistic to say that box experience was the lone factor in Canada’s success. It helped for sure, but Dobbie thinks Sixes gives countries the opportunity to focus heavily on their strengths while masking their weaknesses.\n\nIn a discipline that’s still developing worldwide, that could provide interesting opportunities to see how lacrosse evolves in each nation.\n\n“Take the best of what you have in your country and then build a team around that,” Dobbie said. “Sixes really allows you to highlight your strengths and hide your weaknesses if you have the right strategy.”\n\nDobbie called Emily Boissonneault, Brooklyn Walker-Welch and Lydia Sutton unsung heroes for frustrating opposing offenses and then kickstarting Canada’s own offense on the other end.\n\n“We had such strong defensive matchup players who had the stickwork and lacrosse IQ to transition the ball and take care of the ball,” Dobbie said.",
    "Sudden die-off of endangered sturgeon alarms Canadian biologists": "When the first spindly, armour-clad carcass was spotted in the fast-flowing Nechako River in early September, Nikolaus Gantner and two colleagues scrambled out on a jet boat, braving strong currents to investigate the grim discovery.\n\nDays later, the remains of 10 others were spotted floating along a 100km stretch of the river in western Canada.\n\nIn total, 11 endangered white sturgeon have mysteriously died in a short period of time, blindsiding biologists, who are trying to save a fish teetering towards extinction.\n\nThe species has remained relatively unchanged in 200m years: toothless apex hunters that glide gracefully in a handful of British Columbia’s rivers. To navigate the murky waters, sturgeon gently brush whisker-like barbels that hang from their snout along the gravelly bottom.\n\nWhite sturgeon, with a torso clad in five distinct bony plates called scutes, look every inch a prehistoric fish. The largest ever recorded reached 20ft long and another, believed to be 104 years old, weighed nearly 1,800 lbs.\n\nThe Nechako River, where the sturgeon population has dropped from 5,000 to 500 in the past century. Photograph: Fernando Lessa/Alamy\n\n“When you see a massive head appearing through the murky water and the eyes look at you, it’s just incredible to see this majestic animal alive,” said Gantner, a senior fisheries biologist with the British Columbia government. “And you gain respect for it, knowing that most fish we see are older than us.”\n\nThe rapid succession of deaths has taken an unexpected emotional toll on Gantner and his colleagues.\n\n“I’m deeply saddened. These last couple of weeks, I feel like I’m going through grief,” he said. Each time he and colleagues tenderly move the hulking carcasses of the fish from the shore to the freezer and on to the necropsy table, he feels a pang of sorrow. “I don’t think I felt like that from other fish that I’ve worked with.”\n\nSo far, there are no obvious answers. The team hasn’t found any sign of trauma nor evidence of chemical exposure, disease, or angling-induced death.\n\n“Whatever it is, it affects larger sturgeon, not other species. It’s constrained to a place in time and space. So that gives us some clues,” said Steve McAdam, a biologist with the province’s ministry of land, water and resource stewardship. “In a way, it’s easier to rule a bunch of stuff out than to rule some things in.”\n\nThe deaths in the Nechako are particularly painful for McAdam, who studied a similar die-off in the lower Fraser River in 1993 and 1994, when the region lost 36 fish in two years.\n\nA battery of tests that followed that die-off was inconclusive, said McAdam; the events occurred in differing ecosystems, hundreds of kilometres apart, offering limited clues to investigators.\n\nBecause the team investigating the current episode has a narrow window of time to recover dead sturgeon before decomposition sets in and destroys valuable clues, they have appealed to the public for help. In a region where the fish have deep cultural ties to First Nations and are part of the curriculum in local schools, residents have paid close attention to the phenomenon.\n\nA range of theories have been suggested, including a belief that elevated water temperatures are to blame. But McAdam said previous hot summers had not triggered similar die-offs.\n\n“There’s no end to the ideas. There are some partial explanations, but we’re really trying to keep an open mind and not veer too far down one path,” he said.\n\nTo navigate in murky waters, sturgeon gently brush whisker-like barbels that hang from their snouts along the gravelly bottom. Photograph: Minden Pictures/Alamy\n\nBefore the mysterious die-offs, white sturgeon, which are listed as a federal species at risk, were already in trouble.\n\nOver the last century, the numbers in the Nechako River have dropped from more than 5,000 to only 500. Soon after a dam was built on the Nechako River in 1957, the species experienced what biologists call “recruitment failure” – new fish weren’t being added to the population.\n\nIt is from within that ageing population, already missing an entire generation of fish, that the 11 have died.\n\nOverfishing, drainage projects and dam construction have all contributed to the collapse. On all the rivers in the province where sturgeon once thrived, dams have crushed their populations. Only the Fraser River, the largest without a dam, has a relatively healthy sturgeon population in the tens of thousands.\n\nBritish Columbia has worked since 2001 to help the species recover, drawing teams of provincial and federal biologists, First Nations groups and the industries tied to sturgeon habitat loss, like hydroelectric dam operators.\n\nEfforts include using hatcheries, a “stopgap measure” to help the population recover, as well a longer-term goal of restoring habitat.\n\nBut the sudden death of 11 members of a species already spiralling towards demise mirrors a trend all over the world: sturgeon have become the most threatened genus of fish.\n\nAll of the 26 remaining species of sturgeon are now at risk of extinction. They are the victims of overfishing; in some species, like beluga sturgeon, the roe is prized as caviar. And the habitats they have persisted in are disappearing.\n\n“They are a quite a charismatic species and it’s a fish that has been around for millions of years. So you don’t take it lightly when it’s in danger,” McAdam said.\n\nThe abruptness with which the fish have died has puzzled biologists in part because white sturgeon have been closely studied and monitored for the last three decades, precisely because of their precarious situation.\n\n“And then within a week, this happens. We have a new huge question mark,” said Gantner. “It’s really blindsided us.”\n\nBoth Gantner and McAdam were hopeful that the deaths will serve a broader end, providing valuable insight to biologists into what might have happened – and how a similar outcome can be prevented in the future.\n\nBecause the other option – that they have already reached some kind of a tipping point – is too bleak to consider.\n\n“We’ve never done the experiment of eliminating them fully and seeing how truly important sturgeon are to an ecosystem,” said McAdam. “And personally, I don’t think we ever want to.”",

Canada is a preferred destination for higher education for many Indian students today, with around 60,000 students choosing to go to the country in the first half of 2022, second only to the US.\n\nThe Indian immigration to Canada was pioneered by Punjabi Sikhs. It is estimated on the basis of Canada’s Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, Canada (IRCC) report by local consultants that around 60 to 65 per cent of those applying to go to Canada are from Punjab in India.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver the years, the Punjabi Sikh community has become a rich and politically powerful group in Canada. Sections of the community have also supported and funded the Khalistan separatist movement for decades, and have hosted many individual Khalistani ideologues and extremists. India has repeatedly taken this up with Canada, and the situation has sometimes led to diplomatic embarrassments.\n\nIn 2018 during Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s visit to India, Canadian diplomats had to withdraw a party invitation to a man convicted in the attempted murder of a Punjab minister who was on a visit to Canada in 1986. Jaspal Atwal, a known Khalistan supporter, had been invited to two events organised for Trudeau before the invitation was rescinded.\n\nTrudeau later said, “Obviously, we take this extremely seriously. He should never have received an invitation. As soon as we received the information, we rescinded it. A Member of Parliament had included this individual”.\n\nThat same year, Public Safety Canada, an arm of the Canadian government, said some individuals in the country continue to support Sikh (Khalistani) extremist ideologies and movements in its 2018 Public Report on the Terrorism Threat to Canada, taking note of the movement’s links to terrorism for the first time, while adding that overall the support for the demand has been waning over time.\n\nIn 2010, then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said at a joint press interaction in Canada with his Canadian counterpart Stephen Harper that “the Sikh community in Canada is prosperous” and most Sikhs are “peace-loving and good citizens of Canada”.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“But”, Singh said, “a small group of people have taken to the path of extremism which does great disservice to the Sikh community, India, and good relationship with Canada.”\n\nPrime Minister Singh urged Canada to take action, saying, “Extremism of the religious variety is something not in tune with the growing realities of the integrated world community and globalised community… I have discussed with Prime Minister Harper that the Canadian soil is not used to promote extremism.

It is available year-round, but doesn’t provide parents/grandparents with the same options to PR and eventually citizenship, as the PGP.\n\nEligibility\n\nAt minimum, candidates hoping to sponsor their parents/grandparents through either program must be:\n\nAt least 18 years old;\n\nA Canadian citizen, or PR;\n\nResiding in Canada at the time of application and when parents/grandparents are expected to arrive;\n\nOf good financial standing;\n\nIneligibility\n\nIn addition to failure to comply with the eligibility criteria, candidates will also be ineligible for either program if they:\n\nDid not pay back an immigration loan, a performance bond, or court-ordered family support (i.e.: alimony or child support);\n\nDid not provide promised financial support they agreed to when sponsoring a family member in the past;\n\nFall under any other ineligibility criteria.\n\nFinancial requirements\n\nFor the Super Visa, candidates will have to prove that their household meets the required Low-Income Cut-Off (LICO) criteria.\n\nFor the PGP, candidates should look to meet the Minimum Necessary Income (MNI) requirements for the program. Candidates must show proof of funds by requesting a Notice of Assessment (NOA) from the Canadian Revenue Agency (CRA); showing that the sponsor has met the MNI for their case, and has done so for the last three taxation years, before applying.\n\nApplication process\n\nFor Super Visa sponsorship, the application process is similar to that of a regular TRV. Additional documentation is needed, however, to prove that parents/grandparents can be looked after, upon arriving in Canada.\n\nFor the PGP, candidates must follow the steps to meet and prove their eligibility, and then submit this information to be included in the candidate pool. If candidates are selected, they will receive an invitation to apply, which carries subsequent steps.\n\nFor either the PGP or the Super Visa, the sponsored individuals cannot be medically or criminally inadmissible to come to Canada. An Immigration Medical Exam (IME) is required for both programs, and the PGP also requires a police certificate.\n\nAvailability in Quebec\n\nBoth programs are available to Quebec residents and citizens as well, though there are added steps, including a unique MNI system (for both sponsor and the sponsored), and the need to obtain a Quebec Selection Certificate (CSQ).\n\nSponsor your family for Canadian immigration\n\n© CIC News All Rights Reserved.

    "International students' visa backlog due to an outdated system: lawyer": "An ongoing Canadian immigration backlog of 151,000 applications has left many international students at risk of missing their entire fall semesters altogether. Many schools are recommending they defer their semesters, effectively leaving these students in limbo.\n\nFederal data shows that, as of the end of July, 34 per cent of pending international student visa applications were taking longer to process than government standards dictate.\n\nImmigration lawyer Mario Bellissimo says a main cause of the backlog is an outdated immigration system that attempts to push a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to most applicants.\n\nWhile COVID-19 exacerbated the issue, the problem is more historical, Bellissimo told CTV’s Your Morning on Monday. Arguing that the system has been ‘slow to modernize,’ he advocates a more nuanced approach.\n\n“We need to have provincial specific study permit categories (and) better training and regulation of educational agents that are tracking these students to Canada,” he said.\n\nAccording to Bellissimo, the current immigration pathway of a one-to-four-year study permit, which often leads to a work permit for international students after graduation, doesn’t always guarantee a permanent residence. He says this needs to be made clear to applicants.\n\n“If you remove the one-size-fits-all (system), you'll have a more nuanced system, one that has caps and terminates when individuals can’t be processed in time,” he said, adding that this will allow students to move on.\n\nInternational students now make up almost 20 per cent of all students enrolled in post-secondary institutions in Canada, up from 7.2 per cent in 2010. This group is often considered a potential solution to the country’s aging workforce.\n\nBut, the path to steady employment and citizenship for them is paved with complicated immigration requirements and barriers to entry in many workforces, a report published earlier this month by RBC Economics and Thought Leadership has found.\n\n“For many, a Canadian education may not yield the desired return on investment,” the report stated.\n\nBellissimo says that there isn’t much that the students who are currently in the immigration backlog awaiting their visas can do.\n\n“It's very difficult to deliver a meaningful remedy to these students and so, a lot of their lives are being interrupted by this, and keep in mind when we're thinking about students, we're not just speaking about individuals coming for their first degree,” he said.\n\n“We're thinking about some accomplished students, some that have career experience, those that are coming with spouses and families.\n\nSo there's a lot of myth-busting that has to happen here. And, understanding how many lives this really impacts.”\n\nIn a statement to CTV’s Your Morning, the IRCC said that they are moving to a more “integrated, modernized and centralized working environment,” which is expected to help speed up application processing.\n\nBellissimo says that immigration systems in Canada need to leverage newer technology such as artificial intelligence if they plan to keep up with demand which, at the moment, outweighs supply.\n\nSo far this year, the IRCC has processed more than 360,000 study visas, a 17 per cent increase over the same period in 2021.\n\nThe High Commission of India in Ottawa said in a statement it was talking to Canadian universities about what can be done to accommodate the large number of Indian international students who are still waiting for visas.\n\nThe high commission said universities have also approached the immigration ministry with their concerns.\n\nSome institutions will provide a remote option for students unable to reach Canada at the start of the term because they have not yet received a visa.\n\n“We have to remain true to the principles of the program, which is really to draw in (the) future, potentially in some cases, future Canadians,” Bellissimo said.\n\n“You don't know who is in that backlog. Someone that may make a huge impact on Canada.”\n\nWith files from The Canadian Press",
    "Revenue Canada wants to tax former Winnipeg CAO and his company on bribe money, court documents reveal": "The Canada Revenue Agency wants former Winnipeg chief administrative officer Phil Sheegl and his company FSS Financial Support Services Inc. to pay taxes on bribe money the company received from the contractor that built the Winnipeg Police Service headquarters, court documents reveal.\n\nThe revenue agency said it was reassessing Sheegl's and FSS's taxes for 2011, according to a court document.\n\nThe CRA says that's because the company received a $200,000 \"secret commission,\" which is considered income that it did not declare, according to a notice of appeal filed by Sheegl on April 19, 2022, in Tax Court of Canada.\n\n\"In failing to report all its income for the 2011 taxation year, the appellant made misrepresentations attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default,\" the attorney general of Canada said in a reply to a separate notice of appeal by FSS, which was also filed on April 19.\n\nThe documents say the money Financial Support Services received came from Mountain Construction — a company controlled by Armik Babakhanians, whose main construction business is Caspian Projects Inc.\n\nThat happened in 2011, two days after Caspian was awarded a contract to build the Winnipeg Police Service headquarters, the documents say.\n\nIn 2020, the City of Winnipeg sued Sheegl, along with a number of other people and companies involved in the police headquarters project, alleging a scheme to defraud taxpayers out of millions of dollars. (Tyson Koschik/CBC)\n\nThe police HQ construction project was later the subject of a five-year RCMP investigation that ended in December 2019 with no charges laid.\n\nDocuments filed in the Tax Court of Canada say Babakhanians, through Mountain Construction, paid FSS a $200,000 cheque marked \"consulting fee\" in July 2011. Sheegl gave half to then Winnipeg mayor Sam Katz and wrote \"loan\" on the cheque.\n\nSheegl \"has no knowledge as to why the payor of the deposit referred to the amount as a 'consulting fee' on the cheque, as the amount was not an income item,\" said the FSS notice of appeal.\n\nIt says the amount was \"sale proceeds from the disposition of part of the interest\" in a share of a piece of undeveloped land in Tartesso, Ariz.\n\nWATCH | A 2017 CBC report on the Arizona land deal:\n\nFSS said it didn't declare the money as income because the money did not belong to the company.\n\nIt said $100,000 was owed to Winnix — an Arizona company owned by Sheegl. The other $100,000 was owed to Duddy Enterprises LLC, an Arizona company owned by Katz, according to FSS.\n\nSheegl says the $200,000 was sent to FSS because it's a Canadian company.\n\nWhile FSS maintains the payment was part of a 2011 real estate deal Sheegl and Katz did with Babakhanians, a Manitoba court called it a \"bribe\" in a ruling delivered earlier this year.\n\nIn January 2020, the City of Winnipeg sued Babakhanians, Sheegl and a number of other people and companies involved in the police HQ project, alleging a scheme to defraud taxpayers out of millions of dollars.\n\nThat lawsuit is still before the courts. However, Sheegl successfully fought to have his case separated from the group.\n\nA 2017 photo shows the raw desert land owned by Phil Sheegl, Sam Katz and their co-investors in Arizona, south of the partially constructed community of Tartesso. (CBC)\n\nIn March 2022, a justice with what was then Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench found Sheegl had accepted a bribe and breached his duty as a city officer when he took $327,200 from Babakhanians, which he split with Katz.\n\nThe money was given to Sheegl and Katz in two payments — the $200,000 Mountain sent to FSS, and $127,200 sent to a Katz company.\n\nSheegl was ordered by the Manitoba court in March to pay the city approximately $1.1 million, which included the bribe money and severance pay. He is currently appealing that decision.\n\nMust pay taxes on money given to Katz: CRA\n\nThe latest court documents say FSS is a consulting business and had reported $28,069 income in 2011, as well as a loss of $121,978 partnership income.\n\nThe attorney general's reply to the FSS appeal says \"$200,000 represents a 1,000 per cent increase over what was reported as consulting revenue.\"\n\nThe Canada Revenue Agency also reassessed Sheegl's personal income taxes on March 7, 2019, to include the $100,000 payment to Katz in 2011. The documents say Sheegl's reported income in 2011 was $208,000, but should have included that money.\n\nThe CRA says in court filings that Sheegl benefited by giving that money to Katz, who was mayor from 2004 to 2014, because he didn't have to pay taxes on it.\n\nSheegl's notice of appeal says the $100,000 payment was not made for his own benefit.\n\n\"The payment was owed to Mr. Katz/Duddy for the portion of the interest that was sold to Mr. Babakhanians,\" said Sheegl's notice of appeal. \"Therefore, the payment is not taxable in the hands of the appellant.\"\n\nIn March 2022, a Manitoba court found that Sheegl, shown here in a file photo, had accepted a bribe and breached his duty as a city officer when he took $327,200 from Winnipeg police headquarters contractor Armik Babakhanians, which he split with former mayor Sam Katz. (CBC)\n\nThe attorney general of Canada said by not reporting all his income in the 2011 tax year, Sheegl \"made misrepresentations attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default\" and should pay penalties as a result.\n\nSheegl has 24 years of experience working in real estate and was associated with eight Arizona-based corporations in 2011, and has an understanding of tax matters, says the attorney general's reply to Sheegl's appeal.\n\n\"The appellant knew, or ought to have known, that his income was understated on his income tax return,\" it says.\n\n'No evidence of negligence': appeal notice\n\nThe court filings also say Katz was not part of the Arizona land deal in 2011, because he hadn't purchased an interest in Duddy Enterprises LLC from Phil Sheegl until March 2012, when he purchased the company for $1.\n\nSheegl \"submits there is no evidence of negligence to justify reopening the 2011 taxation year to reassess in respect of the payment,\" his notice of appeal says.\n\nThe Canada Revenue Agency wouldn't comment on the case.\n\nIn an email to CBC News, CRA media relations spokesperson Etienne Biram said \"the courts provide Canadians with a further independent review of disputed issues, and court decisions serve to clarify the law or resolve disputes between the Canada Revenue Agency\" and taxpayers.\n\nThe attorney general of Canada wouldn't comment on the case.\n\nSheegl's lawyers also declined a request for comment.",
    "Mounties’ missteps creating crisis of confidence in Canada’s police": "Hours after the arrest earlier this month of a fugitive wanted in connection with the stabbing deaths of 11 people, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police hastily called a press conference to announce that Myles Sanderson was “no longer a threat” to the public.\n\nBut as RCMP assistant commissioner Rhonda Blackmore described the four-day manhunt, she omitted a critical detail: Sanderson, who had been taken into custody alive, was already dead.\n\nIt was nearly five minutes after announcing his arrest that Blackmore added that Sanderson had died after he went into “medical distress” and was transported to hospital.\n\nReporters covering the press conference were in disbelief. “I have never seen a more egregious case of burying the lede,” tweeted Siobhan Morris of CTV News.\n\nAfter two mass killings in two years – both among the worst in the country’s history –the institutional opaqueness of Canada’s national police force has once again become the focus of criticism. These public communication fumbles – and a troubled legacy of scandals, lawsuits and policing failures – have renewed longstanding questions over the force’s structure.\n\nIn the days since Sanderson’s death, questions over police actions and communication with the public have continued to mount. National media have repeatedly pressed the force after the police said they would not release autopsy results.\n\nAnd it emerged that – despite the fact that earlier in the summer an arrest warrant had been issued for Sanderson on unrelated charges – police do not appear to have been searching for him until he launched his stabbing spree on 4 September.\n\n“In many ways, the RCMP has lurched from crisis to crisis,” said Kent Roach, professor of law at the University of Toronto.\n\nPolice have not publicly speculated on what triggered the eruption of violence in which Sanderson killed 10 people aged between 23 and 78 in the James Smith Cree Nation, an Indigenous community in northern Saskatchewan, and the neighbouring village of Weldon.\n\nAfter the attacks, Sanderson remained at large for four days, with local communities on edge amid a string of false sightings.\n\nAs officers searched for Sanderson, the RCMP was itself the subject of a sprawling public inquiry over its response to another mass killing on the other side of the country, when a lone gunman shot and killed 22 people over the course of 12 hours in rural Nova Scotia.\n\nThe RCMP commissioner, Brenda Lucki, speaks with victims’ family members at an event after the mass stabbing at James Smith Cree Nation, Saskatchewan. Photograph: Heywood Yu/AP\n\nIn that case, police failed to send an emergency alert warning locals of the ongoing threat, and waited 12 hours to alert the public that the suspect was driving a fake police car. The public inquiry heard that two victims died in the time it took Canadian police to get internal approval to tweet a warning to the public about the suspect.\n\nAs the commission wrapped up this week, lawyer Sarah McCullough, who represents most of the 22 victims’ families, said the RCMP demonstrated it was fundamentally untrained, unprepared and unequipped for a major mass killing in a rural area.\n\nDuring the Saskatchewan attack, multiple alerts were sent out to warn residents of the threat. The RCMP also worked closely with local police forces, something they were criticized for not doing in Nova Scotia.\n\n“We definitely saw some improvements in their general communications in Saskatchewan, but it is disturbing there has not been more information about how Mr Sanderson died,” said Roach, author of the recent book Canadian Policing: Why and How It Must Change.\n\nOn Wednesday, Saskatchewan’s chief coroner announced that two inquests – for the stabbing victims and Myles Sanderson – would be launched in the spring.\n\n“With the suspect deceased, there will not be a public criminal trial. Without a public hearing of the facts, it will leave many questions unanswered from the families involved and the public pertaining to the circumstances leading to the deaths,” chief coroner Clive Weighill said in a statement.\n\nA jury in the inquest will only be able to establish fact, not guilt, but can also issue recommendations.\n\n“It is my intention to have the jury wholly comprised of Indigenous persons,” said Weighill.\n\nDue to a quirk of Canadian policing, the RCMP oversees both federal criminal law enforcement as well as operating contract police services to most provinces and municipalities. Only Ontario, Quebec and Newfoundland have their own police forces. But even in Newfoundland, the RCMP handles much of the rural policing.\n\nPeople hold candles at a vigil remembering the stabbing victims in front of City Hall in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. Photograph: Canadian Press/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nBut that system is once again under scrutiny after the Saskatchewan murders, which highlightedthe RCMP’s deficiencies in rural areas and First Nations. The force has only one officer dedicated to policing the 2,400 residents of James Smith Cree Nation.\n\nIn wake of the Saskatchewan attack, the James Smith Cree Nation has discussed creating its own police force to better address the needs of First Nation residents.\n\nThe challenges of enforcing the law on Canada’s rural regions was underlined in 2019 when two teenage murder suspects eluded capture for weeks as they fled into the forested wilds of northern Manitoba. Police only found their bodies after deploying aircraft, heat-sensing technology and dog teams.\n\n“The reality of policing of sparsely populated rural areas is something that Canada really needs to grapple with,” said Roach, who has called for a substantial overhaul of the force. “How much are Canadians willing to pay for policing of these communities?”",
    "As Russia launched into war with Ukraine, here’s who Canada’s ambassador was meeting behind the scenes": "During the first two months of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Canada’s ambassador in Moscow dined with top diplomats, gathered intel from local sources and hosted allies at the embassy.\n\nNearly 100 pages of documents obtained by the Star through an access-to-information request paint a partial picture of ambassador Alison LeClaire’s travel and networking schedule for the crucial months of March and April 2022.\n\nIn the eyes of one former ambassador, the documents show how LeClaire walked a careful line, “serving Canadian interests within strict constraints and difficult circumstances.”\n\nCanada’s Embassy in Moscow, despite acting as Canada’s diplomatic nerve centre in Russia, was described by one Russia analyst at Global Affairs Canada (GAC) as “very under-staffed” in August 2021, according to internal emails reviewed by the Star through an access-to-information request.\n\nIn an April report, Stéphane Dion, in his role as Canada’s special envoy to the European Union and Europe, wrote that “10 years ago, Canada had roughly 50 Canadian employees in its embassy in Moscow; now it has been reduced to just 16.”\n\nPlunged into crisis, with support from her skeleton crew at the Embassy, LeClaire met with connections across the city — and continent — as the war raged on.\n\nLeClaire, named our ambassador to Russia in 2019, convened several events for ambassadors around town, typically hosting at the Canadian Embassy, and occasionally dining out with close allies.\n\nOn March 4, mere days after the invasion began, LeClaire hosted an official lunch for other ambassadors based in Moscow, although the attendees are not disclosed. G7 foreign ministers held a meeting the same day, reiterating their condemnation of Russia’s “unprovoked and unjustifiable war of choice.” Two weeks later, LeClaire organized a midday meal with ambassadors from Croatia, Italy, Lithuania, Egypt and Portugal in a bid to “further information sharing and cooperation,” according to hospitality expense forms.\n\nOn March 18, LeClaire dashed off to Paris for four days of “strategic discussions,” mandated by the Prime Minister’s Office, on the Canada-Europe relationship. All of Canada’s Europe-based ambassadors were to attend the meetings, which aimed to “facilitate coherence and coordination” between GAC and Canadian diplomats on the continent.\n\nAt the end of the month, LeClaire met with one of the “few remaining Canadian businesspeople in Moscow” at Linbistro, a chic Italian restaurant near the Embassy, to understand how the city’s business community was responding to the “crisis situation.” An employee from the Canada Eurasia Chamber of Commerce (the recently renamed Canada Eurasia Russia Business Association) also attended the meeting, according to the documents.\n\nSince February, Canada has imposed sanctions on more than 1,150 individuals and entities from and in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, while GAC now advises that any Canadian business “engaging in commercial activities in Russia or with Russian entities should consider seeking legal advice.”\n\nLeClaire and the head of immigration at the Embassy brought together ambassadors from the Netherlands, Poland, Romania and Slovakia, as well as representatives from the Red Cross and the United Nations Refugee Agency, for a lunch in early April.\n\nParticipants discussed “the impact of the war on refugee flows” as well as humanitarian issues in Russia.\n\nThe Netherlands, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia have all taken in significant numbers of Ukrainians since late February, with 1.2 million refugees from Ukraine registering for temporary protection in Poland alone as of June 30. About 80,000 Ukrainian citizens and returning Canadian permanent residents of Ukrainian origin arrived in Canada between Jan. 1 and August 28.\n\nOn April 12, LeClaire and her deputy, Brian Ebel, met with two Moscow-based representatives of the Orthodox Church in America over lunch to “gather intel on non-public aspects of the Russian Orthodox positioning on the war,” fostering an “already strong relationship” between the Embassy and the Church, according to LeClaire’s hospitality event diary.\n\nTwo and a half months after that meeting, Canada imposed sanctions on Vladimir Mikhailovich Gundyayev, head of the Russian Orthodox Church (a separate entity from the Orthodox Church in America) and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nLeClaire dined with New Zealand’s top diplomat in Moscow, Sarah Walsh, on April 22 at Geraldine, an upscale French bistro, to discuss the “current geo-political situation,” likely bureaucratic shorthand for the impacts of Russia’s invasion. Both Canada and New Zealand slapped sanctions on Russia on April 19: Canada on close associates of Putin, including his two adult daughters, and New Zealand on 18 Russian financial institutions, including Russia’s central bank.\n\nAs the war hit the two-month mark in late April — and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov declared “a new phase” to the conflict — LeClaire, who also acts as Canada’s ambassador to Uzbekistan and Armenia, travelled to Yerevan, Armenia’s capital, for meetings.\n\nOver the course of one week, she dined with two employees from Armenia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and then separately with the U.S. ambassador to Armenia. LeClaire also went to dinner with an expert from a Yerevan-based think tank to gain insights on “Armenia’s foreign policy (notably negotiations with Turkey, and with Azerbaijan) as well as domestic political developments.”\n\nOn her last evening in Yerevan, LeClaire dined with heads of mission from the U.K., Sweden and the EU to “advance key Canadian interests,” and then attended a 20-guest reception for the Armenian-Canadian community at the Hyatt Hotel’s restaurant, with the Canadian government footing the bill.\n\nTwo months later, Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly announced that Canada would be opening a full embassy in Armenia with a resident ambassador.\n\nChris Westdal, who acted as Canada’s ambassador to Ukraine from 1996 to 1998 and later ambassador to Russia from 2003 to 2006, had nothing but praise for LeClaire and her team.\n\nHe told the Star that the documents are evidence that LeClaire was “carrying on in Yerevan and Moscow sensibly and conscientiously, serving Canadian interests within strict constraints and difficult circumstances.”\n\nA GAC spokesperson said that Canadian diplomats in Moscow “provide valuable analysis of the situation on the ground that can help counter Putin regime propaganda, identify potential targets for future sanctions, and support Canada’s overall response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.”\n\nNicole Jackson, an associate professor at Simon Fraser University whose focuses include Russian and Canadian foreign policy, told the Star that the documents show “a little about how our government and, in particular, the Embassy in Moscow was reaching out to various allies and friends, trying to understand events in Ukraine and their geopolitical significance.”\n\nWhen LeClaire returned to Moscow from Yerevan, she held a working lunch at the Embassy to “advance key interests with respect to the current geo-political situation.” This time, LeClaire hosted a disparate group, dining with ambassadors from Brazil, Bulgaria, France, India, Ireland, Mexico, Spain and Switzerland.\n\nWhile filing her expense claims for April, LeClaire requested an advance of 200,000 rubles, equal to roughly $4,000, for the month of May, as she noted “Canadian credit cards (are) no longer accepted in Russia,” requiring her “to pay in cash for provisions for HOM (head of mission) hospitality,” such as coffee, water, and sweets.\n\nTed Fraser is a freelance journalist with an M.A. in international affairs from Carleton University, who has previously worked as an analyst at Global Affairs Canada.\n\nRead more about:\n\nSHARE:",

    "Canada: Nova Scotia To End Immigration Detention in Jails": "Click to expand Image Nova Scotia becomes the Second Canadian Province to End Immigration Detention in its Jails. © Human Rights Watch 2022\n\n(Halifax) – Nova Scotia’s confirmation that it will terminate its immigration detention contract with the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) is another win for migrant and refugee rights, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International Canada said today. The move follows a landmark decision by British Columbia on July 21 to terminate its own contract with the border agency.\n\n“Nova Scotia’s decision is a momentous human rights victory that upholds the dignity and rights of people who come to Canada in search of safety or a better life,” said Samer Muscati, associate disability rights director at Human Rights Watch. “With two provinces now canceling their immigration detention contracts within weeks, the federal government should show leadership by canceling the remaining agreements, which are at the heart of so many rights violations.”\n\nOver the past five years, CBSA has incarcerated thousands of people on immigration grounds in dozens of provincial jails across the country. In Nova Scotia, they are held in provincial jails by default because the province has no dedicated immigration holding center. According to information accessed under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, as of April 2021 the federal government pays Nova Scotia one of the highest rates in the country, CAD $392.30 per day, for each immigration detainee.\n\n“As a result of Nova Scotia’s decision, immigration detainees will soon be spared the corrosive, human rights-impairing conditions of the province's jails, where solitary confinement, mass lockdowns and other forms of routine institutional violence have only intensified since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Sheila Wildeman, Co-Chair of East Coast Prison Justice Society and associate professor of law at Dalhousie University. “We call on the federal government to use the resources devoted to maintaining this brutal practice to instead invest in sustainable immigration settlement supports in the community.”\n\nIn a June 2021 report, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International documented that people in Canadian immigration detention are regularly handcuffed, shackled, and held with little to no contact with the outside world. Canada is among only a few countries in the global north with no legal limit on the duration of immigration detention, meaning people can be detained for months or years with no end in sight.\n\nThe border agency has full discretion over where people in immigration detention are held, with no legal standard guiding the agency’s decision to hold a person in a provincial jail rather than an immigration holding center. In the year following the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the agency relied more heavily on provincial jails, holding 40 percent of immigration detainees in those facilities, at least double the percentage in each of the three previous years.\n\nPeople with psychosocial disabilities (mental health conditions) experience discrimination throughout the immigration detention process. For example, CBSA policy indicates that immigration detainees with psychosocial disabilities may be incarcerated in provincial jails rather than dedicated federal immigration holding centers in order to access “specialized care.” People from communities of color, and Black people in particular, appear to be incarcerated for longer periods in immigration detention and often in provincial jails instead of immigration holding centers.\n\nAcross the Atlantic provinces and throughout the country, migrants and refugee claimants too frequently face abusive, open-ended immigration detention – especially traumatic for those fleeing war or persecution in search of a safe haven,” said Julie Chamagne, Executive Director of the Halifax Refugee Clinic. “Nova Scotia’s decision is an important step forward for human rights. We call on the federal government to enact robust legislative and regulatory changes to stop rights violations in this system across the country.”\n\nNova Scotia’s decision is building powerful momentum to end immigration detention in provincial jails, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International said. Since the start of the #WelcomeToCanada campaign in Nova Scotia six months ago, approximately 4,600 people have called on the province to take this step.\n\n“We commend Nova Scotia for its decision to stop locking up refugee claimants and migrants in the province’s jails solely on immigration grounds,” said Ketty Nivyabandi, secretary general of Amnesty International Canada (English Speaking). “There is now clear pressure to end this harmful practice across the country. We urge other provinces and the federal government to follow suit.”",
    "The Republic of Korea and Canada: Stronger Together - Joint Leaders’ Statement": "We, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and President Yoon Suk Yeol of the Republic of Korea (ROK), met today in Ottawa to celebrate and strengthen a vibrant friendship that is reflected in the depth and diversity of our ties.\n\nOn the eve of the 60th anniversary of the Canada-ROK diplomatic relationship in 2023, we acknowledge that ours is a special friendship forged together through war, people-to-people ties, a mutual commitment to multilateralism, the rules-based international order and global commerce, and sustained by a shared spirit of innovativeness, creativity, and entrepreneurship.\n\nCanada and the ROK have long been like-minded partners on matters of peace and stability. Canada stood with the ROK through the Korean War, defending not only its people but also the international order we were building, made real in the United Nations. Since then, we have been working together to protect and strengthen democracy, security, and human rights, including the rights of women and girls, in the region and around the world. We reiterate our common objective of the complete denuclearization of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). President Yoon explained the ROK’s Audacious Initiative and Prime Minister Trudeau expressed his strong support for President Yoon’s efforts to achieve a denuclearized, peaceful and prosperous Korean Peninsula.\n\nOur peoples have built strong ties, too. Many Canadians and Koreans live, work, and study across their borders, creating vibrant communities, families, and businesses, becoming an essential part of our cultural fabric, and making our friendship stronger. Similarly, many of our students have lived or studied in each other’s world-class universities, creating a strong network of friends between Canada and the ROK.\n\nOur long friendship, highlighted by the establishment of the Canadian embassy in Korea in 1973 and the Korean embassy in Canada in 1965, was more recently reinforced when we established the Canada-ROK Strategic Partnership and subsequently signed the Canada-ROK Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and Science, Technology, and Innovation (ST&I) Cooperation Agreement. These agreements have been an important part of our lasting friendship, increasing trade and economic prosperity for both of our countries and facilitating collaboration between our most innovative researchers, scientists, and entrepreneurs.\n\nNow more than ever, Canada and the ROK – Canadians and Koreans – are ready to modernize our bilateral relationship and to advance, through joint action, the values that we share. Today, we are upgrading our bilateral relationship to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, based on the following five shared priorities in the areas of values, security, prosperity, sustainability, and beyond.\n\nDefending the Rules Based International System, Democracy, Freedom, Human Rights, and Gender Equality\n\nStrengthening Security and Defense Partnerships, including Peacekeeping and Maritime Security\n\nEnhancing Economic Prosperity and Security, Cooperating on Supply Chains, Critical Minerals, and ST&I, and Promoting Trade and Investment\n\nAddressing Climate Change and the Environment, Supporting Energy Security, and Developing Sustainable Energy Sources\n\nDeepening Partnerships in Health and Culture\n\nTo begin implementing our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, we are pleased to jointly welcome the creation of the new annual Canada-ROK Climate Change Dialogue, the renewal of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on Defence Materials Cooperation between the ROK Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) and the Canadian Department of National Defence (DND), and the renewal of the MOU on Industrial Technology and Innovation Partnership between the Korea Institute for Advanced Technology (KIAT) and the National Research Council Canada (NRC).\n\nToday, we agreed to work towards launching a high-level dialogue on economic security involving the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Industry. Reflecting the increasingly important nexus between economic interests and security, we also commit to address economic security challenges through enhanced cooperation and coordination. This includes deepening our strategic partnership on supply chain resiliency. We will seek to position both countries as globally competitive players in the critical minerals supply chain and battery and EV (Electric Vehicles) value chains in ways that support our collective prosperity and security, while raising labour and environmental standards. To that end, we agreed on the need to develop an MOU in the coming months to enable the building of value chains in Canada and Korea to support clean energy transition and energy security, including with respect to critical minerals. We also agreed on the need to strengthen the bilateral Joint Committee on Science, Technology, and Innovation (ST&I).\n\nWe are also committed to strengthening ST&I cooperation in emerging technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence (AI), and next generation network beyond 5G) and exploring future opportunities for bilateral collaboration on AI while seeking to identify mechanisms to drive collaborative innovation for the benefit of all citizens. Furthermore, recognizing the importance of ensuring mutual economic prosperity, we commit to seeking opportunities to grow bilateral trade and investment to ensure the creation of well-paying jobs in both economies.\n\nWe note with appreciation the contributions made by our Working Holiday Program to promoting people-to-people exchanges and will continue to explore avenues for its renewal. In recognition of the upcoming 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Canada and the ROK, we have designated 2024-2025 as the Year of Cultural Exchanges between Canada and the ROK.\n\nDuring the 60th anniversary of our diplomatic relations next year, and as we strengthen cooperation through our forthcoming Indo-Pacific strategies, we look forward to working together on several important initiatives under our shared priorities to fully implement the Canada-Korea Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.\n\nExpressing his gratitude for Prime Minister Trudeau’s warm welcome and hospitality, President Yoon extended, and the Prime Minister accepted with gratitude, a sincere invitation to visit the ROK, an occasion that promises to mark yet another leap in the bilateral relations upon the 60th anniversary.",

    "Jarring notes: Issues Indian students face in Canada": "Seema Sachdeva\n\nThe recent incident of hooliganism by some Indian students in Canada, which went viral, puts the spotlight on the issues they face in a foreign land\n\nLoud Punjabi music is blaring from a modified car with boys on a ‘geri’ route. A cop tries to stop them but the ‘kakas’ attempt to intimidate the police officer and use abusive language.\n\nAlso read: Woman Sikh police officer speaks on fate of 40 Punjabi youths who tried to ‘intimidate’ Canadian cop on duty\n\n40 Punjabi youths block Canadian police officer's car in Surrey; to face deportation\n\nMeanwhile, more boys of their ilk crowd around, some simply to watch, others making videos that they would later upload. The incident that has been shaking the social media took place in Strawberry Hill, Surrey (British Columbia) on September 11.\n\nThe car’s silencer (muffler) removed, a group of Indian students had been taking rounds in the Sheridan plaza area. Following a complaint over the loud music, a police officer reached the area. When he issued them a ticket, some started banging on the bonnet of the police car, one even tried to open the driver’s door. Fearing for his life, the officer immediately left the place.\n\nAs many as 40 youths, mostly students on study visa, are said to be involved, directly or indirectly, in this incident of hooliganism. According to Constable Sarbjit Sangha, media relations officer of the Surrey RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police), “Threatening and trying to intimidate a police officer on duty is a serious matter. One youth has been identified while investigation is on to identify others. Some of them may be deported to India. Earlier, too, we had deported some Punjabi youths for causing nuisance here.”\n\nTerming it completely unacceptable, Rachna Singh, MLA from Surrey Green Timbers and parliamentary secretary of anti-racism initiatives, says, “For the past two to three years, incidents of inappropriate behaviour by Indian students, particularly from Punjab, have been coming to our notice. This kind of reckless conduct by even a small number makes things difficult for the rest of the hard-working, sincere students who are here to change their fortunes.”\n\nProf Prabhjot Parmar of the University of Fraser Valley, Abbotsford, however, feels that such incidents must not be applied as a blanket representation of the Indian children coming to study here. “I’m sure such nuisance would not be tolerated even in India. While it will certainly bring attention to the fact that these 40-odd miscreants were international students, we have to understand that there are bound to be children with different types of behaviour, especially when such huge numbers are coming from India,” she says.\n\nCanada has been home away from home for Punjabis since long, but the last few years have seen a huge influx of students from India. Since the country opened its doors with the fast-track Student Direct Stream (SDS) programme, study visa has become a ticket to get permanent residency. Most of these students take admission in two-year diploma courses, which makes them eligible for a three-year work permit. According to the Canadian Bureau for International Education, there were 6,21,565 international students in Canada at all levels of study at the end of 2021. While there is no countrywise breakup, Indian students make up the maximum at 35 per cent. As many as 65 per cent of the Indian visa applications for Canada are from Punjab. The statistics released by the National Foundation for American Policy in March this year found that ever since visa restrictions increased in the US (from 2016 to 2019), the number of Indian students at Canadian colleges and universities went up by 182 per cent.\n\nFigures state that international students boost the Canadian economy by about $24 billion. Ruing this loss of human and financial resources, Gurbhajan Singh Gill, chairman of Punjabi Lok Virasat Academy, Ludhiana, says, “A large number of seats in our colleges are lying vacant, while children are thronging innumerable private shops offering IELTS training to leave the country where they see no opportunities for themselves. We need to look at where our education system is failing.”\n\nWith most Indians (read Punjabis) settled in Ontario and British Columbia (BC), a number of students from Punjab prefer to study and live in areas closer to Brampton and Surrey for a feel of home, besides easy availability of Indian food and no language hurdles. Students mostly live in groups of 10 to 15 in the basements, sharing the rent. They have gained a reputation of not maintaining the property well, besides indulging in brawls.\n\nSays Rishi Nagar, Senator at University of Calgary, “Most of the students come straight after finishing Class 12. In the absence of any parental guidance, many have no regard for the local laws and regulations. From driving cars with loud music and jumping red lights to jay walking on roads and stepping out in bathroom slippers, which is looked down upon here, they are clueless about the norms being followed. One understands the huge cultural difference that these students must be experiencing but their parents and families back home should guide them about the need to respect the norms and culture in another country.”\n\nThe incidence of fights among the students is limited, say only 5-7 per cent, but these get highlighted and noticed because of social media, feels Shameel Jasvir, host and news director at REDFM, Toronto. “Often, a few rich students who are not bothered about completing their courses can be seen driving flashy cars with Punjabi songs blaring. They create a bad name for the rest of the sincere and hardworking ones, who, too, are looked at with disdain by the established community here.” He says that the non-acceptance from the locals adds to their sense of isolation. They do not want to share their problems back home for the worry it would cause and often end up facing mental health issues, he says, adding that cases of death by suicide among students have also been reported over the past few years.\n\n“Making ends meet with a work permit of 20 hours a week is not enough. It is an open secret that many students work for cash, often at stores and warehouses owned by Indians. Many a time, the employers exploit them by making them work beyond the timing or pay them less than the fixed wages. Youths often get involved in drug peddling to make easy money. It is sad that there have also been instances of sexual assault on girl students while some of them even get into trafficking,” says Sameer Kaushal, news director at AM600 Sher-e-Punjab Radio, based in Richmond, BC.\n\nRakesh Kumar Rhythm, who is based in Langley, British Columbia, feels the kind of courses students are taking up is an issue. “Proper guidance is missing. Often immigration consultants and travel agents in India guide them to their commission-based diploma courses. For instance, the diplomas in associated sciences or arts programmes have little or no utility for the students unless they enroll in expensive university degree courses. So, after their course gets over, most end up picking low-paying jobs. Instead, they should do specific diplomas in skill-based technical courses such as dental hygiene, lab technician, radiology, plumbing, electrician, carpentry, etc, which remain in high demand and pay you as much as a white collar job here.”\n\n“Most of the students who come to us are interested in taking admission in diploma courses like associated arts or business administration,” says Kamal K Bhumbla of BN Overseass Educational Services, Jalandhar. “We advise them to go for technical or skill-based courses but often they choose courses their friends are also taking up,” adds the immigration consultant. “Unlike earlier, most of the students nowadays are going to Canada in groups.” On lesser number of visas being issued, he says it could be due to backlog but good profile visa applications never get rejected.\n\nThe problem, says Toronto-based community activist Jaspal Bal, is that most of these children, barely out of school, are enrolled in courses that are not academically challenging. Taking a compassionate view of the incidents of misbehaviour by the international students, Bal, whom Indian students approach regarding their issues, feels deportation of kids is not a solution. “The students have come here chasing the dream of permanent residency, just like many others who came here decades back, and who too must have made many such mistakes. They need our help and guidance. We cannot just shun them.” If and when some of these kids are deported, they’ll be a low-hanging fruit for gangsters and other anti-social elements, he says. “It will only scar and break them for life.”\n\nConstable Sarbjit Sangha\n\nThe Tribune Interview\n\nParents should guide, support children\n\nConstable Sarbjit Sangha, media relations officer, Surrey RCMP, talks about the fate of the 40 Indian students who tried to intimidate the police officer and more. Excerpts from an interview:\n\nWhat exactly happened that day?\n\nOn September 11, when our police officer tried to issue a violation ticket to a car driver, the crowd swarmed around and started abusing him. They also tried to stop his car. Our investigation is on. One suspect has already been identified while the identification of others is on. Once the investigation is completed, a detailed report will be forwarded for further action to the Canadian Border Services Agency, which can take a decision on their deportment as well.\n\nHow serious can the charges be?\n\nAccording to the Canadian Criminal Code, two charges will apply: Obstruction of Justice System and Intimidation of Justice System. These are both very serious charges. If you are convicted in court, you will be given a jail sentence of two years and five years, respectively. Depending on how many more such cases these students have been involved in earlier, they can be deported as well. Merely being a spectator or video-taping the incident is not against the law, but whosoever is involved in the act of intentionally stopping the officer’s car will be charged.\n\nHave there been cases of deaths by suicide?\n\nWhile the number of suicides is not very high, it is definitely a matter of concern. International students face a lot of stress. It is more in cases where they don’t have a work permit. I have spoken to many girls who say their parents have sent them to Canada and they will not spend more on them. Any fee, rent or other expenses are to be managed on their own. Many girls, who don’t have work permit, work here on cash, where they are sometimes exploited by the owners. If there’s any sexual assault by the employer, they do not report the matter out of shame. While very few cases come to us, we know such things are happening in our community.\n\nWhat is your message to parents and students?\n\nWhen you send your children to a new country, make them aware of the rules and regulations there, including motor vehicle laws. Your responsibility doesn’t end with sending your child to Canada. When you decide to send your sons or daughters to a foreign country, please make sure you have the financial means to support them till their studies get over.\n\nIf international students are victims of any kind of crime, they should not hesitate to report to the police. We are here to help the Indian community. Also, please keep in mind that every time there is a negative contact with the police, be it related to theft, fight, etc, it gets reported to the immigration department. This can affect your prospects in getting permanent residency.\n\nPhotos: The Tribune, istock\n\nWorry back home For parents in India, diplomatic rows like the one over a pro-Khalistan referendum leaves them with anxiety over the safety of their children. In its advisory to Indian nationals and students in Canada, the Indian government mentions a sharp increase in incidents of hate crimes, sectarian violence and anti-India activities in Canada. Diplomatic tensions could create problems for Indian students. An issue of some worry, say experts, is that Canada has opened its SDS programme to Pakistan students as well. Toronto-based mediaperson Shameel Jasvir says, “We understand parents must be concerned about the safety of their children, but they can be rest assured that there has been no sectarian violence.” Neither in the Vancouver area, says Richmond-based news director Sameer Kaushal, nor Calgary, according to Senator Rishi Nagar, who is presently in India.\n\n#Canada",

    "Canada Called Itself a Genocide State. Iran Was Listening": "When dictators are called out by the international community for perpetrating human-rights abuses, they often attempt to deflect criticism by accusing their Western critics of hypocrisy. In April, for instance, China denounced the US State Department’s annual Country Report on Beijing’s human-rights practices as “a pretense the U.S. government uses to cover up its agenda of seeking hegemony” over such nations as Afghanistan. “The U.S. should immediately cease making irresponsible remarks,” said Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian. “Instead, it needs to reflect on itself, mend its ways, and work earnestly to improve its own human-rights situation.”\n\nIn substance, these attempts at moral equivalence lack credibility. But they can have the appearance of truth when our adversaries base their propaganda on self-incriminating statements made by the West’s own media figures and politicians.\n\nThis week, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi took the rostrum at the United Nations General Assembly to deliver Iran’s habitual denunciations of Western “double standards.” While anti-hijab protests rocked numerous Iranian cities in the wake of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini’s death at the hands of Tehran’s morality police, Raisi went through a predictable laundry list of complaints, accusing Israel of creating the “world’s largest prison” in Gaza, and denouncing US detention policies at the Mexican border. But he also threw in an attack on Canada’s treatment of Indigenous peoples, declaring that “bodies of hundreds of children were discovered in mass graves in a [former residential] school.”\n\nAs a Canadian, I found this element of Raisi’s performance maddening. Thanks to Canada’s own misinformation mill, the Iranian President didn’t have to go to the bother of inventing his own lies. My own country’s journalists and leaders did that job for him.\n\nThe issue of supposed unmarked Indigenous child graves dominated the Canadian media in the latter half of 2021. But as I reported in Quillette several months ago, no “mass graves” were ever found. In fact, even the Indigenous groups that initially reported ground-penetrating radar (GPR) survey results consistent with the possible presence of unmarked burial sites weren’t talking about “mass graves.” Rather, the invented mass-graves claim was popularized by a badly botched New York Times May 28th, 2021, story written by reporter Ian Austen. (For a definitive debunking, see Terry Glavin’s account in Canada’s National Post).\n\nIn the 16 months that have passed since the unmarked-graves story broke in late May 2021, not a single body has been found, nor any human remains. And so even the less sensational allegation that 215 individual unmarked child graves lie buried under the grounds of a former Indigenous residential school in Kamloops, British Columbia, now seems doubtful. Nor have bodies or human remains been recovered at any of the other former residential-school properties where GPR surveys were conducted.\n\nYet that didn’t prevent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau from lowering flags on Canadian public buildings for more than five months, nor from speaking publicly as if bodies were already being dug up. And aside from the National Post, not a single major Canadian media outlet has admitted its role in feeding the unmarked-graves social panic that exploded last year, and which often included lurid speculation that the supposed grave sites not only contained the remains of Indigenous children, but that these children had been murdered through methods worthy of a horror-movie plot.\n\nGiven this, what can Canadian public figures say to Raisi now that he’s throwing spurious moral equivalences into our faces? Nothing. In making the false claim that “bodies of hundreds of children were discovered in mass graves in a [former residential] school,” the man is merely reading our own officially sourced misinformation back to us.\n\nThis isn’t the first time that Trudeau has managed to maneuver Canada into this kind of mortifying position vis-à-vis the world’s tyrants. Last year, when Canadian lawmakers voted to denounce China’s treatment of Uighurs in western Xinjiang as a form of genocide, Trudeau and his Cabinet abstained. The suspected reasons for that move were complex. But they included the fact that Canada was, by its own description, morally compromised on the genocide file: Back in 2019, Trudeau had explicitly acceded to the (absurd) claim that Canada, too, was guilty of “genocide”—this one against Indigenous women. Indeed, according to the official report that precipitated Trudeau’s mea culpa, this supposed Canadian genocide remains ongoing.\n\nThe leaders of Russia, Belarus, Iran, North Korea, Syria, and Venezuela know a good propaganda opening when they see one. Last year, these nations collectively called on the UN to investigate crimes against Canada’s Indigenous peoples—doing so, cleverly, on the same day that Western nations were launching a UN campaign to demand that China allow international investigators access to Xinjiang.\n\nWords have consequences—especially when they comprise the vocabulary of mass slaughter. The repetition of ghoulish hyperbole about Canada doesn’t just gratuitously harm the country’s reputation. It also helps the world’s autocrats get away with crimes that are anything but fictional.",
    "FIRECIRCLE IGNITING MORE TOURISM ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN CANADA": "1,000 Canadian tourism entrepreneurs to receive funded training and mentorship by Firecircle\n\nVANCOUVER, BC, Sept. 26, 2022 /CNW/ - How does Canada's beleaguered tourism industry inspire entrepreneurs to start new businesses? And how does it help those operators who are recovering from the pandemic to stabilize and grow while bravely navigating new economic hardships? Firecircle – that's how.\n\nToday, Firecircle announced its latest project, Transition to Tourism Entrepreneurship, an intensive business development program founded on Firecircle's innovative 5x5 Method and customized to empower 1,000 tourism and hospitality entrepreneurs from across Canada to envision, launch and grow their best business ideas through a series of animated online and live video workshops, step-by-step guidance and expert, sustained mentorship. The new resources being prepared and delivered through the Transition to Tourism Entrepreneurship program are targeted at the needs of Indigenous, rural, Northern and Francophone entrepreneurs as well as entrepreneurs with disabilities seeking to start a business or recover their existing operations from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAccording to Destination Canada's latest reports, domestic tourism spending and activity have increased to near 2019 levels and demand for Indigenous and rural tourism is on the rise, both domestically and internationally. However, the tourism industry's small and medium sized businesses, who make up over 99% of tourism businesses in Canada, are still struggling to recover and repoint to meet that demand. Deneen Allen, CEO of Firecircle and one of Canada's leading sustainable tourism advisors, is passionate when she says, \"It is imperative that the entrepreneurial spirit and capacity of our tourism industry be supported with effective education and mentorship that create opportunities for new growth and future resiliency – that's where this exciting program comes in\".\n\nA full 500 of the 1,000 total participant seats in the Transition to Tourism Entrepreneurship program are being offered to Indigenous entrepreneurs, supported in partnership with the Indigenous Tourism Association of Canada (ITAC). \"This partnership will continue our efforts to return the Indigenous tourism industry to the historic levels of 2019. Firecircle will be an important partner in supporting aspiring Indigenous entrepreneurs on their journey to developing their business plans, helping the industry recover, and build resiliency from the impacts of the pandemic. We are excited to offer this program to our members, which supports The Original-Original Accreditation Program as a tool for businesses who need extra support,\" says Keith Henry, President and CEO of ITAC. A further 500 participant entrepreneurs will be invited to join the program from rural and Northern communities across the country.\n\nFirecircle is the only digital, mentored business accelerator platform for tourism and hospitality entrepreneurs in Canada. \"Firecircle launched in 2020 to inspire new - and strengthen existing - tourism and hospitality entrepreneurs. Our goal is to raise the bar in product and experience development in Canada's tourism industry,\" Deneen says. \"Our national Ignite team of coaches and mentors for the Transition to Tourism Entrepreneurship program are focused on building robust, professional businesses through foundational knowledge and sustained mentorship in a way that has not previously been accessible for many of the project's target clients.\"\n\nTransition to Tourism Entrepreneurship is an exciting, three-year project funded in part by the Government of Canada's Sectoral Initiatives Program (SIP), by The Firecircle Ltd. and by an in-kind contribution by the Indigenous Tourism Association of Canada. Applications for participation in the project will begin in October 2022; successful applicants will be onboarded beginning November 2022.\n\nFor more information on The Firecircle Ltd. visit www.thefirecircle.ca/programs\n\nSOURCE Firecircle\n\nFor further information: Noelle Aune, Noelle Aune Communications, 403.861.1982, [email protected]",

REUTERS/Chris Helgren\n\nOTTAWA, Sept 11 (Reuters) - More than a year after the Great Resignation took hold in the United States, Canada is grappling with its own greyer version: The Great Retirement.\n\nCanada's labor force grew in August, but it fell the previous two months and remains smaller than before the summer as tens of thousands of people simply stopped working.

    "In 'peaceful' Canada, government ministers are considering U.S.-style security": "“At the same time, we have to recognize that political conversation and debates are becoming more bitter and more aggressive. … And it’s something that should worry us profoundly as a democracy.”\n\nAside from the prime minister, Canadian politicians — including Cabinet ministers and opposition leaders — are not automatically assigned security details. But amid a spate of harassment and violent threats being reported against politicians and journalists in recent weeks, the government is facing increased pressure to respond.\n\nOn Friday, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland was accosted at the city hall in Grande Prairie, Alberta, as she was entering an elevator. In a video widely circulated on social media, a large man approached her, calling her a “f—ing traitorous f—ing b–h,” and told her to leave the province. Freeland appeared to be accompanied only by female staffers.\n\nAt a press conference Wednesday in Calgary, Freeland deflected questions about whether she needs heightened security, saying only that she will “always follow the advice” of police. She said she still feels welcome in Alberta, the province where she was born and raised, and where she still has family.\n\nFreeland has spoken recently about wanting political leaders to remain accessible to voters, in contrast with the United States. When U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen visited Toronto in June, Freeland later recounted, she asked how Freeland’s security detail felt about the deputy prime minister biking to the Royal Ontario Museum to meet her. Freeland said she had to explain to Yellen that she had no such detail.\n\n“A real strength of Canada is that I feel safe being out there on my own,” she said. “I hope that that can continue.”\n\nOther politicians evidently disagree. “It’s time for ministers to have security … worthy of a G-7 country,” Conservative MP Gérard Deltell said Monday on Twitter. Provincial ministers in Quebec, Deltell’s home province, are accompanied by armed drivers who act as bodyguards.\n\nTrudeau acknowledged Wednesday there’s disagreement among members of his Cabinet about whether every minister needs a bodyguard. “I think it’s a very personal decision for many ministers,” he said.\n\nEarlier in the week, Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino told reporters the government is looking at options to improve security for politicians, but didn’t offer specifics. Canadian members of Parliament are now being issued panic buttons they can use to immediately alert local police.\n\nThe incident involving Freeland occurred amid a broader discussion of harassment and abuse directed at public figures in Canada, including journalists. In recent weeks, a number of female journalists, including several journalists of color, have reported receiving violent, misogynistic, racist threats online.\n\nTrudeau and other leaders have publicly denounced the pattern of threats. The Canadian Association of Journalists is calling on police forces to improve their processes for responding to complaints of hate speech and harassment.\n\nOn Wednesday, Procurement Minister Helena Jaczek told reporters she believes the impact of Covid-19 on social interaction is partly to blame for the increasing toxicity. “It’s not Canadian behavior,” she said. “It’s surprising.” Jaczek said she was subject to “verbal abuse and somewhat intimidating behavior” during Canada’s 2021 federal election.\n\nThe Liberal government has promised to tackle the rise in hate with new “online safety” legislation that would aim to make social media companies more accountable for harmful content on their platforms. But the government’s initial proposals, which included forcing tech giants to take down flagged content within 24 hours, met with heavy pushback and concerns about censorship.\n\nThere’s no timeline for legislation to be introduced.\n\nThe bill is sure to be contentious, however, particularly if Canada’s opposition Conservatives elect frontrunner Pierre Poilievre as their leader next month. Poilievre has accused the Liberals of “attack[ing] free speech at every opportunity,” and has promised to protect Canadians’ “freedom of expression online.”",

A 40-acre parcel of urban land reserve in Saskatoon will see the construction of Kahkewistahaw Landing, a multi-use gathering place that will house a medical center providing culturally sensitive social services, commercial and office space, a conference center and hotel and the headquarters for the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations. Among current and pending investments in agri-food and mining, the Saskatchewan Research Council and the Saskatchewan government last year announced a $35 million rare earth processing facility to be located in Saskatoon. Adjacent land and facilities have been leased by Cheetah Resources Saskatchewan and Northstar Innovative Developments, potentially making way for a rare earth processing hub in the city.\n\nBRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nVancouver Economic Commission\n\nEleena Marley, CEO\n\n“The past forty-five years have cemented the film industry as a crucial economic pillar for our city, employing tens of thousands of Vancouver residents in diverse, well-paying jobs and paying billions in wages.” — Vancouver Mayor Kennedy Stewart, October 2021\n\nRecent Projects: Nirvana Life Sciences, Empire Co. Ltd., Lululemon Athletica Canada, Precision NanoSystems\n\nThe VEC in June announced its Zero Emissions Economic Transition Plan (ZEETAP), a three-year initiative that aims to help workers and businesses navigate the transition to a net-zero economy. Over the past 10 years, Vancouver has experienced strong growth in its green economy, with green jobs growing by 87% and a quadrupling of the number of businesses “greening” their operations, says the VEC. While it was a 16.6% drop from a “record-shattering” $4.1 billion spent in 2019, the $3.4 billion spent in the region by the local film, television, post-production and animation industries was “a pleasant surprise to even optimistic industry stakeholders,” said the VEC last October, just after Walt Disney Animation Studios announced a new studio in Vancouver and Double Negative announcing it would add hundreds of jobs across Canada including 150 in Vancouver.\n\nBurnaby Board of Trade\n\nPaul Holden, President & CEO\n\n“Our world is changing rapidly and cities like Burnaby need to be able to adapt quickly and deploy innovative solutions to solve the emerging challenges we face in the 21st century, and we’re excited to be partnering with one of Canada’s top research universities to find those solutions.” — Burnaby Mayor Mike Hurley at the July announcement of the Civic Innovation Lab, a partnership project that will harness the academic and research capacity of Simon Fraser University to find fresh solutions to issues and challenges affecting Canadian cities\n\nRecent Projects: Parkland Fuel Corp., Bridge Studios Holdings, Electronic Arts, Amazon, Kardium\n\nThe city in early 2022 committed to a $500 million investment in key infrastructure, which Mayor Mike Hurley said “will tie into our long-term plans to make vital shifts in housing, transportation and climate action in Burnaby.” As new residents pour into B.C. in general and the Vancouver region in particular, as of May 2022 more than 9,600 units of rental housing — both non-market and market — were either being built or in the development stream. Meanwhile, in addition to the expanding Electronic Arts campus, the city sold a parcel of land to Larco Investments to develop a 300,000-sq.-ft. film studio expected to generate more than 1,000 good jobs. Burnaby is already home to more than 60% of B.C.’s purpose-built sound stages.\n\nMANITOBA\n\nEconomic Development Winnipeg\n\nDayna Spiring, President & CEO\n\n“All inland ports have rail at the heart of their developments and the CentrePort Canada Rail Park is the linchpin in realizing the vision for a true trimodal inland port — and North America’s largest — right here in Manitoba.” — Diane Gray, President and CEO, CentrePort Canada, on plans to develop a new 665-acre rail park with Focus Equities\n\nRecent Projects: Maple Leaf Foods, Ubisoft, Palliser Furniture Ltd., Amazon, Paterson GlobalFoods\n\nEconomic Development Winnipeg created Talent & Workforce Development and FDI teams in late 2019, and its Market Intelligence team has developed a series of data dashboards to support better decision-making for companies. Intelligence gathered from company leaders by the organization’s Business Development team has bolstered ED Winnipeg’s support for enhancing the Interactive Digital Media tax credit, one of the reasons (in addition to diversity and depth of talent and the education ecosystem) that Ubisoft Winnipeg was encouraged to expand in the city. In July 2021, Winnipeg was named one of TIME’s World’s Greatest Places and in October 2021 it was named the world’s Most Intelligent Community by the Intelligent Community Forum.\n\nNEW BRUNSWICK\n\nGreater Moncton/City of Moncton\n\nKevin Silliker, Director, Economic Development\n\n“I am delighted that we have been able to secure a suitable home for our Land Systems business in New Brunswick and expect, over the years ahead, that Marshall will become a leading employer in the region, creating a host of high-value employment opportunities both directly and through our broader supply chain.” — Marshall Canada Managing Director Sam Michaud, on the finding of a site in Moncton for its new Land Systems production and integration facility, March 2022\n\nRecent Projects: ALIVE Kombucha, Missing Link Technologies, Walmart, Marshall Land Systems\n\nThe Conference Board of Canada projects Moncton will grow at 1.9% through 2024, buoyed in part by construction momentum on projects such as the Junction Urban Village development. Among other attractions: Office space is as much as 60% lower than other urban areas, and home ownership in Moncton is 37% of the national average. In July the city announced that total value of building permits so far in 2022 had reached $220.5 million spread across 624 permits, with the second quarter’s permit value 4.5 times the total from Q1 and May 2022 turning out to be the best May in the past decade. Also in July, the city council approved Moncton’s first Community Energy and Emissions Plan (CEEP), an action plan to get the community to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\n\nNOVA SCOTIA\n\nHalifax Partnership\n\nWendy Luther, President & CEO\n\n“My favorite activity in Halifax is to duck out of the Rafflebox office during lunch and go for a walk on the Halifax waterfront ... I continue to be impressed by this city’s ability to maintain its character and history while embracing innovation.” — Simon Cusack, Co-founder, Rafflebox, on returning to his home territory to open a new office\n\nRecent Projects: CPQi Inc., BeyondTrust, Avanade Inc., Cognizant Technology Solutions\n\nAccording to the Halifax Index 2022, Halifax welcomed more than 9,200 people in 2021 and had the third highest growth rate of major cities in Canada, driven by interprovincial migration. Business confidence in Halifax reached an all-time high thanks in part to rebounding retail sales and GDP growth of 6%, while over three-quarters of residents surveyed said they were satisfied or very satisfied with life in Halifax. “By many metrics, Halifax is coming out of the pandemic in a strong position,” said Ian Munro, chief economist, Halifax Partnership, in May 2022. “Our economy rebounded well in 2021 with over 9,000 more jobs than pre-pandemic, and our population growth remained very positive with more young people, immigrants, and expats calling Halifax home.”",
    "Canada's tipping culture is flawed and there's no clear fix in sight: experts": "1:53:00 FULL EPISODE: What's your tipping story?\n\nFrom oil changes to take-out food, the \"tip nudge\" has quickly become a \"well-established societal norm\" in Canada, according to food economist Mike von Massow.\n\nCard payment machines have made it simple for businesses to prompt a gratuity option, even in industries where tipping previously wasn't part of the cost or conversation. And data from Canadian trade associations show the average percentage tip for restaurant dining has gone up since the pandemic began.\n\nVon Massow, who's also a professor at the University of Guelph, says the expectation for Canadians to increase the amount of their gratuities is getting out of control, and has become a hot-button issue across the country.\n\n\"I went to my local craft brewery the other day, just to the bottle shop, to pick up a couple of cans of my favourites,\" von Massow said. \"When I was paying there, literally someone grabbed beer out of the fridge and gave it to me and I was prompted to tip in that circumstance.\"\n\nHe calls it a \"double whammy\" for consumers, with more businesses asking for tips while simultaneously raising their prices.\n\n\"You know, I've started to wonder if I give a particularly good lecture, should I put a jar at the front of the lecture hall at the end, and as they file out? Maybe they could drop a few bills in there for me, too. I mean, where does it stop?\"\n\nInternational alternative\n\nKate Malcolm moved to Port Perry, Ont., in 2017 from the U.K., where tipping isn't common.\n\nFive years later she says she still has a hard time coming to grips with Canada's tip culture.\n\n\"There is no way that in England you would give $10, $20, $30 to a hairdresser,\" she said. \"It's so expensive to get your hair done as it is, and then you have to tip them as well? It's such a foreign concept.\"\n\nMalcolm, who runs a podcast aimed at newcomers, included her reaction to Canada's unwritten rules for gratuities in a TikTok video outlining her \"culture shock.\"\n\nA screenshot of Kate Malcolm in a TikTok video that includes her reaction to Canada's unwritten rules for gratuities. (Kate Malcolm/TikTok)\n\nShe says when her parents first came to visit they were also unclear what the expectations were for tipping in Canada, leading to an awkward exchange at a restaurant.\n\n\"They kind of just threw coins on the table, like maybe $2 and change, and were like, 'that's all we do, right?' I was cringing for that. I'm like, that is probably more insulting than not doing it [tipping].\"\n\nMalcolm lived and worked as a server in Australia, as well, where tipping is also not the norm.\n\nShe said the wage was much higher than in Canada, and without the expectation to make tips, she felt less pressure to be \"super friendly\" all the time.\n\nSome customers outraged by tip prompt\n\nThe Dough Bakeshop in Toronto added a gratuity option to its card machines after input from employees and customers.\n\nCo-owner Oonagh Butterfield says they've always had a cash tip jar at the counter but saw a significant increase in tips when customers were given a debit or credit card option to do so.\n\n\"I've had signs up since we implemented it, being as clear as I can be, saying it's not expected,\" she said.\n\nOonagh Butterfield, co-owner of Dough Bakeshop in Toronto, says some customers have shown outrage about being prompted for a tip even with signs posted in the store that say tips aren't expected. (Photo by Dylan Garez)\n\nDespite posting signage like \"to bypass the tip option please press green\" Butterfield says some customers still question the electronic gratuity option.\n\n\"Sometimes there's a little bit of, I'll say, outrage around the fact that they're even being asked the question, 'would you like to tip?' Especially if they're just buying bread, which, again, is why I try to communicate to people this is not a necessity.\"\n\nDespite currently having the tip option for customers, Butterfield says she supports moving away from Canada's current tipping culture, \"so that everyone can be guaranteed a living wage.\"\n\nNo tipping equals prices raised to give staff living wage\n\nIn July 2020, Toronto's Richmond Station restaurant did away with tipping, instead choosing to raise its prices to pay staff more.\n\nCo-owner Carl Heinrich calls Canada's tipping culture \"a very inequitable way of paying staff.\"\n\nThe lockdown forced his business to start offering take-out — historically a service that didn't generate a lot of tips, he says.\n\n\"Any time you edit somebody's wage or pay, their livelihood, there's a lot of communication necessary,\" Heinrich said. \"Because there was no blueprint for this new system, there was a lot of work. And frankly, two years later, it's still work.\"\n\nCarl Heinrich is the co-owner of Richmond Station restaurant in Toronto. He says they did away with tipping in July 2020. Instead, they chose to raise their prices to pay staff more. (Photo by Sarah Brownlee)\n\nThere isn't one flat rate of living wage for staff at Richmond Station. Pay varies depending on a person's performance, experience and their position, he added.\n\n\"Dishwashers are making a living wage. Servers are making a living wage. But certainly our best servers are paid more than our least experienced servers. In the previous system that wasn't possible.\"\n\nIn an ideal world, there would be no tipping. It's a human rights catastrophe. But it's just so deeply entrenched. I think we're stuck with it. - Marc Mentzer, business professor, University of Saskatchewan\n\nAside from \"very top end\" restaurants, where customers might not be as sensitive about how much they're spending, says University of Saskatchewan business professor Marc Mentzer, many businesses that replace tipping with service charges don't succeed.\n\nCustomers like the illusion of having power over the server and the server likes the illusion of controlling the amount of their own income, he adds.\n\n\"In an ideal world, there would be no tipping. It's a human rights catastrophe. But it's just so deeply entrenched. I think we're stuck with it.\"\n\nMarc Mentzer is a professor at the University of Saskatchewan’s Edwards School of Business. He says the card reader for electronic payment has changed expectations around how much to tip, when to tip, and what for. (Submitted by Marc Mentzer)\n\nHefty pre-programmed tip percentage options on chip card machines can \"scare people into tipping a higher percentage than they might have ever considered before,\" Mentzer added.\n\n\"Everybody complains about tipping, but given a choice between a restaurant with tipping and a restaurant with a service charge, I'm not sure how customers would make that choice. I think customers might actually prefer the tipping approach if given the choice.\"",
